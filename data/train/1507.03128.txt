    "it is important to study the brittle fracture both from the point of view of numerous applications and in order to further propel our knowledge of intrinsic properties of solids .",
    "a set of experimental facts presently collected on fracture is very impressive .",
    "however , the understanding of physical aspects of the its mechanisms is still far from completeness .    since decades a common opinion worked out that the crack behavior is determined by the process zone , a nano- to mesosized domain in the vicinity of its tip . for the long time , however , the process zone was beyond the reach of experiments",
    ". recently new experimental techniques ( described in more details below ) emerged that enable one to study structure and properties of the solid in the close vicinity of the crack tip .",
    "these as well as some more traditional experimental techniques have shown that fracture is often followed by a rearrangement of the solid structure in the close vicinity of the crack tip .",
    "this challenges one to find a theoretical approach adequately describing such a phenomenon .",
    "stress - induced local phase transitions ( lpts ) at crack tips have been reported in literature since long time .",
    "they have been observed in different classes of materials .",
    "stress induced austenite - martensite lpts in metals have been studied since 60th @xcite and are under a keen attention up to now .",
    "martensite lpts have been observed in iron @xcite and steels @xcite , @xcite .",
    "active studies of the martensite lpt in ni - ti ( nitinol ) alloys widely - used in application are being actively carried out @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "lpts are also exhibited by other shape - memory alloys , such as cu - al - ni @xcite , @xcite , cr - ni @xcite , ni - al @xcite and ti - al - nb @xcite .",
    "crack tip lpt from the bulk bcc phase into the nanoscale fcc phase zone has been very recently observed in molibdenum @xcite , the latter phase being nonexistent under pressure , @xmath0 .",
    "zro@xmath1 based ceramics have received a large attention , since it has been observed that the tetragonal - monoclinic phase transition at the crack tip strongly improves their fracture toughness @xcite , @xcite @xcite .",
    "ferro- and antiferroelectric ceramics have also been reported to exhibit lpt under fracture @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the fracture toughness improvement due to the superconducting lpt in ybco and bscco at the crack tip has been reported in the paper @xcite .    a structural rearrangement within the crack tip zone in sapphire manifested in formation of metastable al - o - al clusters at its fracture surface",
    "has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "the crack tip stress - induced structural lpts have been also observed in polymers and epoxies  @xcite .",
    "resins are known to exhibit crystallization at the crack tip strongly affecting the fracture process @xcite .    as for general trends in the evolution of the methods of the lpt observation",
    "one can note a transition from indirect methods of analysis to those making it possible to obtain a direct structure of the transformed zone with a high spatial resolution , combining few techniques in one study often appropriate for propagating cracks .",
    "one should first of all mention the method of high - angle annular dark - field scanning tem approach allowing for the direct imaging of atomic locations .",
    "it is this method that has been recently used to detect the crack tip lpt in molibdenum . to exclude any interpretation ambiguity the results",
    "have been further combined with the electron nanodiffraction patterns @xcite .",
    "further , the combination of micromechanical loading with _ in - situ _ high - resoluion x - ray microdiffraction @xcite enabled the authors to image a complex lpt zone in the polycrystalline nitinol .",
    "the combination of the _ in - situ _ sem with the electron backscatter diffraction @xcite made it possible to study the evolution of the emerging phase in the tip vicinity during the fatigue experiments .",
    "the _ in - situ _ optical digital image correlation technique made it possible to obtain strain fields and the phase boundaries at the tips of propagating cracks @xcite .",
    "raman mapping revealed the local distribution of phases in the vicinity of the crack tip @xcite .",
    "afm maps the lateral distribution of the surface height .",
    "the latter is directly related to spontaneous phase transition strain , thus , enabling one to distinguish phases and determine the phase boundary @xcite , @xcite .    on the theoretical side",
    "three approaches can be pointed out .",
    "first , atomistic mechanisms of lpts have been revealed by computer simulations and density functional theory - like calculations for several solids , such as iron @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , silicon @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , tantalum @xcite , zirconium @xcite , uo@xmath1 @xcite , molibdenum @xcite , nitinol @xcite .",
    "this became possible as the result of the computation power development , and advancement of the molecular dynamics approach , as well as in implementation of hybrid approaches combining the molecular dynamics with quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the simulations revealed a strong dependence of the lpt formation upon ( i ) loading mode , ( ii ) crack plane and direction and ( iii ) sample geometry @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they further elucidated atomistic mechanisms leading to the lpt development @xcite , @xcite .",
    "second , a number of researches exploited a mechanical approach treating the lpt zone as the one only differing from the rest of the solid by its ( i ) elastic properties and ( ii ) spontaneous strain .",
    "antolovich @xcite was first to propose a mechanism of the transformation toughness of a quasi - static crack .",
    "references to further papers of this kind one finds in the reviews @xcite , @xcite @xcite as well as in the book @xcite .",
    "the above approach ignores the fact that the local phase transition is related to one or several internal degrees of freedom of the solid obeying their intrinsic constitutive laws .",
    "a third stream of works just focused on the role of the internal degrees of freedom in the formation of the lpt at extended defects .",
    "it has been pioneered by the paper of nabutovsky and shapiro describing the dislocation - induced lpt @xcite . in the papers of korzhenevskii",
    "the effect of the lpt on the behavior of dislocations and , thus , on plastic properties of the solid has been established @xcite,[a now ] formation of the lpt at a moving dislocation has been described in the paper @xcite .",
    "lpt at wide domain walls has been described in @xcite , while those at narrow twin boundaries has been addressed in the papers @xcite .",
    "this approach has also been developed in application to brittle fracture .",
    "formation of the lpt at the crack tip has been analytically described in the papers @xcite and @xcite , and numerically in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that mechanisms of the brittle solid resistance to the crack propagation are attributed to its process zone ( pz ) .",
    "the pz notion only has sense , if such a zone can be clearly distinguished from the bulk of the solid .",
    "the latter can only be done ,  if at least one its  physical  property  exhibits a perceptible variation across  the  pz  boundary .",
    "it may either be an abrupt quantitative variation such as the elastic nonlinearity @xcite or hyperelasticity @xcite , or any qualitative variation .",
    "in the latter case the pz differs from the bulk by e.g. its chemical composition or crystal structure .",
    "such properties determining qualitative differences are always controlled  by internal solid  degrees  of  freedom , @xmath2 , as e.g. , concentration of reaction species in the former and phonons , magnons , electronic degrees of freedom , etc . in the latter case .",
    "we focus on the case of the pz qualitatively different form the solid bulk by its structure described .",
    "condensation of any such structural degree of freedom in the bulk of the solid ( @xmath3 ) corresponds to a bulk phase transition ( pt ) : structural , magnetic , electronic respectively .",
    "the degree of freedom related to the condensate , @xmath2 , is referred to as the `` order parameter '' .",
    "high values of stress at the crack tip : @xmath4 may trigger formation of a transformational pz , where @xmath5 within the zone , while vanishing  outside .",
    "this situation may ,  thus ,  be  regarded  as  a lpt . here",
    "@xmath6 is the stress tensor and @xmath7 is the radius - vector counted off from the crack tip @xcite .",
    "the present paper reports the case of the second order lpt admitting a fully analytical treatment .",
    "the latter is of a paramount importance , since it gives hints of what can be expected in more complex cases that can not be treated analytically .",
    "we show here that in a solid undergoing a second order phase transition a lpt zone with the size @xmath8 forms at the tip of the motionless as well as propagating crack either above , or below the line of the phase transition on the phase diagram . we show that in the both cases the difference , @xmath9 , between the transformational process zone ( tpz ) emerging temperature , @xmath10 , and the bulk transition temperature ( the curie point ) , @xmath11 , is @xmath12 the difference , @xmath13 , we refer to as the `` temperature shift '' . here",
    "@xmath14 is the stress intensity factor applied to the crack , @xmath15 is the young s modulus , @xmath16 is the slope of the phase transition line in the @xmath17 phase diagram , @xmath18 is the order parameter kinetic constant and @xmath19 is the one defining the energy of the order parameter inhomogeneity , the parameter @xmath20 is related to the curie constant , @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "the upper sign corresponds to @xmath23 , while the lower one - to @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , if the phase diagram slope is positive ( @xmath25 ) , the lpt only takes place below the phase transition line in the phase diagram @xmath26 , while the negative slope ( @xmath23 ) results in @xmath27 , that is , the zone containing a low - temperature phase is embedded into the matrix of a high - temperature phase ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    we , further , demonstrate the existence of the critical velocity : @xmath28 such as soon as the crack tip velocity exceeds the critical one , the tpz vanishes .    in the discussion",
    "we first illustrate the results using the examples of few ferroelectrics : batio@xmath29 , pbtio@xmath29 and linbo@xmath29 .",
    "we , further , estimate typical values of @xmath30 , valid for most inorganic solids .",
    "this represents our most striking result .",
    "indeed , the typically @xmath31 values lie between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this implies that the tpz existence region covers a considerable part , if not the whole phase diagram , though only at one side of the phase transition line .",
    "we then discuss experimental difficulties of the tpz detecting , as well as possible ways of its observation .",
    "we , finally , put forward a general approach for the concept of the process zone .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate an equation describing the order parameter dynamics .",
    "lengthily details of its derivation we give in appendix a. in section iii we find the analytical solution of the pz equations . in section",
    "vi we report our numerical results . in section",
    "v we make numerical estimates and give comments generalizing our findings .",
    "dynamic behavior of the order parameter splits into several universality classes as it is suggested by the hohenberg - halperin - ma scheme @xcite . within this scheme",
    "the most simple and simultaneously most often met case is referred to as the model a describing the dynamics of a nonconserved order parameter , @xmath2 , corresponding to a phase transition .",
    "we focus on the case related to crystal structure variation within the process zone , that is , the case of a structural lpt . for pts of such a type",
    "the order parameter generally represents a multicomponet object , @xmath34 , each component being composed of combinations of displacements of the unit crystal cell atoms .",
    "its properties are completely determined by the corresponding irreducible representation of the crystal symmetry group in the high - symmetry phase of the solid @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the high - symmetry phase @xmath35 , while in the bulk low - symmetry phases the components @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) of the order parameter , are either equal to constants , or to zero .",
    "they are independent of spatial coordinates , at least within a single domain of a given phase .",
    "such an approach introduced by landau in 1937 @xcite enables one to classify all phases and to predict possible bulk phase diagrams @xcite , @xcite .",
    "here we adapt this approach for the description of the local transformational pz .    in this paper we only consider the case of a single - component order parameter ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "being simple it already catches the most important properties of the dynamic lpts .",
    "it is also important for another reason .",
    "one observes that in solids with pts described by multicomponent order parameters , most of their bulk low - symmetry phases are described effectively by one independent parameter .",
    "for example , the low - symmetry phases in batio@xmath29 are generally described by the three - component polarization vector @xmath39 . however , in the tetragonal phase one finds @xmath40 , in the rhombohedric phase - @xmath41 and in the orthorhombic phase - @xmath42 : all these phases are , thus , effectively single - component ones .",
    "this situation is characteristic also for structural pts in many other materials .",
    "this makes the case of the single - component order parameter distinguished .",
    "equation describing the order parameter dynamics can be obtained with the help of the dissipation function:@xmath43 and the free energy : @xmath44 where @xmath18 is the kinetic constant , @xmath45 is the time , @xmath46 is the free energy density , @xmath47 is the strain tensor and @xmath48 is the domain . since we consider a thin plate case here , @xmath48 represents a plane and @xmath49 .",
    "that is , we assign both @xmath50 and @xmath51 to the unit solid thickness in the @xmath52 direction .",
    "here we address the simplest case of a pt describing by a one - component order parameter . in the one - component case",
    "the only possible transformations under the action of the crystal symmetry group are either @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "being invariant with respect to the crystal symmetry , the free energy should only contain even functions with respect to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it takes the following form : @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the free energy density , the function @xmath57 denoting its part responsible for the pt itself : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the constant parameters of the landau potential ( [ freeenergy ] ) , while @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a constant , @xmath63is the temperature and @xmath64 is the curie temperature and @xmath65 is the order parameter gradient . the case of the first order transition @xmath66 will be analyzed elsewhere .",
    "the strain tensor , @xmath47 , is defined in a usual way : @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the displacement vector .",
    "@xmath69 is the elastic part of the free energy density . for simplicity",
    "we consider here the elastically - isotropic case with @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are lame constants @xcite , where @xmath73 yields their relations to the young s modulus and poisson s ratio , @xmath74 .",
    "the latter should not be confused with the stress tensor @xmath75 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the constants @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath76 , @xmath64 and @xmath77 represent the material constants of the solid in question together with @xmath15 and @xmath74 .    finally ,",
    "the , so - called , striction constant , @xmath77 , already introduced above is responsible for the interaction between the strain and order parameter fields and can be either positive or negative .",
    "it should be noted that the form of the interaction term @xmath78 in ( [ freeenergydensity ] ) implies that the phase transition only gives rise to the spontaneous dilatation .",
    "it is only this case that is considered in the present paper .",
    "our final results are more convenient to express in terms of the slope of the phase transition line , @xmath16 , on the @xmath17 phase diagram directly related to the striction constant @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , one can represent the term @xmath79 in ( [ freeenergydensity ] , [ fch ] ) as @xmath80 , yielding @xmath81    equation of motion can be built on the basis of ( [ freeenergy ] , [ dissipationfunction ] ) as follows @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the variation sign .",
    "one obtains the following system of equations : @xmath84\\eta-\\beta_{0}\\eta^{3}}{\\partial\\sigma_{ik}/\\partial x_{k}=0}\\label{glk1}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the laplace operator and @xmath86 is the stress tensor : @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "the last term , @xmath89 , in the expression ( [ stress2 ] ) describes the spontaneous stress generated by the phase transition . for simplicity",
    "we omitted the inertial term in the second eq .",
    "( [ glk1 ] ) , which is valid , if @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the sound speed .",
    "equations ( [ glk1 ] , [ stress2 ] ) represent the complete system describing the dynamics of the transformational pz .",
    "one can eliminate the elastic degrees of freedom , @xmath92 , form the equations of motion ( [ glk1 ] ) as it is described in details in appendix a. after their elimination one comes to the single equation of motion or the order parameter : @xmath93\\eta-\\beta\\eta^{3}\\label{effectiveglk}\\ ] ] in contrast to the strain tensor @xmath94 met in eq .",
    "( [ glk1 ] ) describing both the field of the tip and that generated  the pz , the tensor @xmath95 only describes the strain field of the `` undressed '' tip , i.e. , the one without the lpt ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "it is given by the the well - known fracture theory expression @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the polar coordinates counted off from the crack tip and @xmath74 is the poisson s ratio .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 is expressed in terms of @xmath100 ( [ fch ] , [ glk1 ] ) as follows : @xmath101 equation ( [ effectiveglk ] ) exhaustively describes the order parameter dynamics within the pz .",

    "this opinion gives rise to the illusion that they should only have a negligible effect on the crack dynamics .",

    "the softness of the second order phase transitions only means that the solid continuously passes from the state @xmath106 to the state @xmath213 in the transition or bifurcation point .",
    "this is in contrast to the first order transitions where in the transition point the order parameter exhibits a jump .",
    "the effect of the lpt on the crack dynamics is , however , not related to the order parameter behavior in the transition point .",
    "it depends upon absolute values the order parameter can achieve within the lpt zone . in the discussion below",
    "we will argue that the zone is typically very wide .",
    "this implies that the pz order parameter is most often in the saturated state . in this respect",
    "the second order phase transition exhibits no qualitative difference from that of the first order . in the case of structural phase transitions",
    "the order parameter can be constructed using the atoms displacements from their positions in the mother phase .",
    "their saturation values may achieve the values smaller , but comparable to the crystal lattice cell dimensions both in the case of the first and second order phase transition .",
    "it should be , further , noted that for one thing the value of the bifurcation point , @xmath10 , is obtained by the analysis of the linear part , ( [ leigen ] ) , of the nonlinear equation for the order parameter . for the other , the answer to the question , whether the pt is of the second , or first order depends only upon the structure of the nonlinear terms of the free energy ( [ fch ] ) .",

    "detailed inspection of the works cited above shows that in most of them the local phase transition has been detected by the analysis of the fracture surface available after the sample has been broken , the so - called , `` post mortem '' examination . in the case of the zirconia ,",
    "for example , the fracture surface exhibited a layer of the monoclinic daughter phase about @xmath386 thick on top of the tetragonal mother phase surviving a considerable time after fracture .",
    "this requires the zirconia to be deep within the hysteresis region of its phase diagram . indeed , martensitic transformations in both martensite - austenite metals and zirconia exhibit wide hysteresis regions",
    "this is , however , rare , for most solids the hysteresis does not exceed @xmath373 , while the second order transitions have no hysteresis at all .",
    "in contrast to the local phase transition within the hysteresis , the transformation zone outside of the hysteresis region is only present under stress .",
    "as soon as the stress is removed it immediately disappears .",
    "it can not , therefore , be detected by the `` post mortem '' inspection of the fracture surface .",
    "further , at a high temperature one may observe no zone at @xmath387 , but since @xmath388 the zone may show up at higher stress intensity factor , that is , at the tip of a propagating , rather than motionless crack .",
    "detection of a local phase transition outside the hysteresis region is , therefore , a challenging experimental task .",
    "the notion `` process zone '' is already in use since long time .",
    "its emergence reflects the understanding that the small domain in the immediate vicinity of the tip of a brittle crack should have special properties due to high stresses present there .",
    "behavior of propagating cracks exhibits pronounced deviations from predictions of linear fracture mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that they can only be explained by mechanisms located within the process zone @xcite , @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the content of this notion stays so far on an intuitive level .",
    "below we outline the process zone concept from the physical point of view .",
    "equation of motion of the crack tip can be regarded as that of balance of forces , the driving force , @xmath389 , being balanced by ( i ) @xmath390 representing a kind of `` dry '' friction force and ( ii ) by additional resistance force generated within the process zone . within the force balance",
    "concept the zone is the source of resistance of the solid to the crack propagation , since it is here that this additional force is generated .",
    "the concept of the process zone itself implies that it is possible to distinguish the solid inside from that outside of the zone using at least one physical property .",
    "though in principle one can imagine a zone with a smooth , gradual variation of all its properties , we believe that the situation in which at least one physical property of the solid abruptly varies across the zone boundary is much more realistic and , hence , often met .",
    "we parametrized the differences of the solid properties inside the zone from those outside by the field , @xmath2 . without the loss of generality we assume @xmath106 inside the zone , while vanishing outside . in this respect",
    "our point of view is akin to the popular phase field approach @xcite . in principle",
    ", this field may describe either an abrupt quantitative variation of some solid property , or its qualitative change . in the latter case the situation is usually qualified as a phase transition , while @xmath2 is referred to as the order parameter . in the present paper we focus on this latter case .",
    "at present the terms `` phase transition '' and `` order parameter '' unify a crystal structure variation of solids with bifurcations in non - linear systems , both equilibrium and non - equilibrium , such as e.g. , bifurcations taking place during chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "it is tightly related to the fact that each of these transitions can be described by its inherent order parameter(s ) .",
    "they exhibit a few classes of universalities generating the corresponding types of kinetic equations imposed on the order parameter(s ) , therefore , giving rise to different configurational forces acting on the zone boundary and , hence , exerted on the crack tip .",
    "the most often met universality class is associated with the order parameter obeying the ginzburg - landau - khalatnikov equation @xcite , since it is related to the simplest bifurcation .",
    "this one is addressed in the present paper .",
    "the zone at the crack tip may , however , be associated with any of such phase transitions or their combinations .    the long - wave elastic field at the tip of a brittle crack exhibits its own universal behavior expressed by the well - known small - scale approximation for the stress or strain field @xmath391 .",
    "this latter universality combines with one of those mentioned above .",
    "we illustrate the above ideas within the example of classical structural phase transitions related to changes in lattice structures in crystals in response to the temperature and/or pressure variations .",
    "structural phase transitions can be classified according to their own classes of universalities .",
    "these are related first of all to the symmetry change taking place during the transition(s ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the latter is manifested in ( i ) the number of components of the order parameter and ( ii ) structure of the ginzburg - landau - khalatnikov equation .",
    "it , in particular , defines the form of interaction of the order parameter with other degrees of freedom including elastic ones .",
    "one observes in addition that the ranges of the values of material parameters in use are quite narrow .",
    "this allows one to determine typical numerical values of the parameters derived in our model .    to conclude , within our approach the process zone is regarded as a domain which is unambiguously different from the bulk of the solid .",
    "the difference may either be quantitative ( such as a prominent variation of at least one physical parameter ) , or qualitative ( e.g. the difference in its symmetry , crystal structure or chemical composition ) . such a variation ( or their combination )",
    "takes place due to the high stress in the vicinity of the crack tip , as a consequence of the nonlinearity .",
    "our approach is , further , based on the accounting for the universalities inherent both to the fracture mechanics and bifurcations of non - linear systems offering a way to classify zones according to the universality classes as well as on the observation of their typical features .",
    "the zones related to the elastic nonlinearity @xcite , formation of the secondary cracks @xcite , crack tip chemical reactions @xcite , electronic structure variation @xcite as well as the transformation zone reported in the present paper fit into this general scheme .",
    "below we exclude acoustic degrees of freedom from the equation of motion as it has been proposed in the paper @xcite . making use of ( [ glk1 ] , [ stress2 ] )",
    "one can express the displacement vector , @xmath68 as@xmath392 where @xmath393 is the displacement field created by the `` undressed '' crack ( that is , the crack without any lpt ) and @xmath394 is the green function of the elastic solid with a cut . to the best of our knowledge the explicit form of such a green function is unknown . we approximate it with the green function of the infinite elastically - isotropic body @xcite . passing to the reciprocal space under the integral in the representation ( [ green1 ] ) and making use of the identity @xmath395  ( where @xmath396 is the fourier - transform of the green function ) one finds the strain field , @xmath397 in the following form : @xmath398 where @xmath95 is the strain of the `` undressed '' crack and @xmath399 is the fourier - image of @xmath400 . the result ( [ green2 ] )",
    "leads one to the following expression for the trace of the strain field:@xmath401 the first term in the right - hand sides of any of the expressions ( [ green1 ] ) , ( [ green2 ] ) and ( [ trace ] ) describes the strain field generated by the `` undressed '' crack , while the second one yields the lpt contribution .",
    "substitution of the strain trace ( [ green2 ] , [ trace ] ) into the free energy ( [ freeenergy ] , [ freeenergydensity ] , [ fch ] , [ fel ] ) yields the effective free energy ( [ effectivefreeenergy ] ) with the factor @xmath76 ( [ beta ] ) in front of @xmath402 instead of @xmath100 .",
    "in the low - temperature phase the branching equation is mostly convenient to obtain starting from the effective free energy .",
    "the latter has the form : @xmath403 it differs from the expression ( [ feff ] ) by the existence of the cubic term , @xmath404 , where @xmath405 passing to dimensionless variables : @xmath406 , @xmath407 one finds : @xmath408    where @xmath409   \\right\\}\\]]@xmath410   ^{1/2}\\ ] ] the integrals @xmath411 and @xmath412 are defined as in ( [ in ] ) .",
    "the integrand of @xmath413 becomes complex as soon as the expression @xmath414 under the radical becomes negative .",
    "this takes place along the line @xmath415 where @xmath255 ( [ lowtemp ] ) turns into zero . at smaller values of @xmath98 one",
    "finds @xmath106 . for",
    "this reason in @xmath416 one should only integrate over @xmath417 from @xmath418 to infinity , while the integration over @xmath163 runs from @xmath419 to @xmath420 .",
    "the integration has been done numerically using a standard nintegrate routine of mathematica 10.1 @xcite employing an even - odd subdivision method with the local adaptive strategy . below only the ratios @xmath421 and @xmath422 are used .",
    "these ratios and their fitting by simple functions:@xmath423@xmath424    the effective free energy ( [ fefflow ] ) has a cubic term .",
    "since it is positive , one finds that the left minimum of the free energy ( [ fefflow ] ) is more pronounced .",
    "analogously to the static state one concludes that the solution of the branching equation should be chosen that corresponds to this deeper minimum , that is , the negative one .",
    "let us note that in a general case the sign of @xmath252 is opposite to the one of @xmath259 . should we have chosen a negative @xmath259",

    "a semi - circular domain has been defined with the diameter , @xmath427 . by trial and error",
    "we find that it is large enough , to let the solution vanish well far from the domain boundary .",
    "the initial mesh size of @xmath428 has been chosen , but the adaptive mesh refinement option has been further used to automatically refine the mesh as appropriate . the no - flux boundary condition has been set at the boundary @xmath429 and the condition @xmath430 at the rest of its boundary . a straightforward simulation of the static equation ( [ sim1 ] ) with such boundary conditions , however , only returns the trivial solution @xmath430 at any value of the control parameter @xmath272 . to avoid this instead of ( [ sim1 ] ) we introduced a pseudo - dynamic equation : @xmath431   ^{1/2}}{\\left (   x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+\\varepsilon\\right ) ^{1/2}}\\right ]   u - u^{3}\\label{pseudotimestepping}\\ ] ] where @xmath432",

    "stable solutions of the static equation ( [ sim1 ] ) represent fixed points of the dynamic system ( [ pseudotimestepping ] ) . as initial condition we used a smoothed step function , only unequal to zero in a vicinity of the point @xmath438 .",
    "the dynamic system has been solved using the direct mumps solver with the bdf time stepping .",
    "the convergence of the solution to its fixed point has been controlled by the behavior of the @xmath439 , the maximum value of the function @xmath440 . by trials we found that 700 pseudo - time steps ensure a good convergence , though sometimes it has been necessary to keep the process as long as 3000 steps .",
    "figure [ convergence ] shows the example of such a convergence study for a number of simulations in which all parameters except @xmath272 were fixed , while @xmath272 varied .",
    "one can see that far from the bifurcation point the convergence takes place well before @xmath441 pseudo - time steps are done .",
