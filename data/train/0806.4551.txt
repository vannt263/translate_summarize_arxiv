    "lacking a complete theoretical understanding of    color confinement , the only method of applying qcd is based on the factorization of the dynamics and the isolation of a short - distance part which is amenable to perturbative techniques of quantum field theory ( see , @xcite and for a review , for instance , @xcite and references cited therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the long - distance part has to be parametrized in terms of matrix elements of quark and gluon operators between hadronic states ( or the vacuum ) .",
    "these matrix elements have nonperturbative origin and have to be either extracted from experiment or be determined by lattice simulations . in many phenomenological applications they are usually modeled by applying various nonperturbative methods .    the qcd description of more involved hadronic processes requires the introduction of new hard parton subprocesses and nonperturbative functions .",
    "important particular examples are exclusive hadronic processes which involve hadron distribution amplitudes ( das ) , generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas ) , and generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite . within this context ,",
    "collisions of a real and a highly - virtual photon provide a useful tool for studying a variety of fundamental aspects of qcd .",
    "a special case of this large class of processes is the exclusive two - hadron ( pion ) production in that region , where one initial photon is far off - shell ( with its virtuality being denoted by @xmath2 ) and longitudinally polarized , with the other photon being transversely polarized , while the overall energy ( or , equivalently , the invariant mass of the two hadrons ) , @xmath3 , is small .",
    "such a process factorizes into a perturbatively calculable short - distance dominated subprocess , that describes the scattering @xmath4 or @xmath5 , and nonperturbative matrix elements measuring the transitions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "another extensively studied  both theoretically and experimentally  two - photon process is the pion - photon transition form factor .",
    "this exclusive process has been measured by the cello @xcite and the cleo @xcite collaborations for an almost on - shell ( i.e. , real ) photon , whereas the other one has a large virtuality of up to 9  gev@xmath8 and is transversely polarized .",
    "these data have been analyzed over the years by many authors using various theoretical approaches  see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "the major outcome of the most recent study @xcite is that the cleo data exclude the chernyak - zhitnitsky pion distribution amplitude @xcite at the @xmath9 level , while , perhaps somewhat surprisingly , also the asymptotic distribution amplitude seems to be disfavored ( being off at the @xmath10 level ) .",
    "these findings are supported by the latest high - precision lattice simulations by two independent collaborations @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the only pion distribution amplitude found to be within the @xmath11 error ellipse of the cleo data , while complying with the new lattice results just mentioned , is the pion model derived from nonlocal qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "these results lend credibility to the usefulness of two - photon processes as a means of accessing and understanding the parton structure of hadrons . on that basis",
    ", one may try to assess more complicated two - photon processes with two pions in the final state .",
    "indeed , recently , nonperturbative quantities of a new kind were introduced ",
    "transition distribution amplitudes ( tdas ) @xcite  which are closely related to the gpds and describe the transition @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast to the gdas , mentioned above , such nonperturbative objects , like the tdas , appear in the factorization procedure when the mandelstam variable @xmath3 is of the same order of magnitude as the large photon virtuality @xmath2 , while @xmath13 is rather small . actually , there exists a reaction where both amplitude types , gdas and tdas , can overlap .",
    "precisely this can happen in the fusion of a real transversely polarized photon with a highly - virtual longitudinally polarized photon that gives rise to a final state comprising a pair of pions .",
    "this reaction can potentially follow either path , i.e. , it can proceed via the twist-@xmath1 gdas , or through the leading - twist tdas , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ gen - fact - mechs ] .",
    "the first mentioned possibility is linked to the case when one of the involved photons is longitudinally polarized , whereas the other one is transversely polarized .",
    "the second possibility corresponds to the same situation , but appears in contrast to that in leading - twist order , as we will show in sec.[sec : fact2 ] .",
    "thus , a comparative analysis of both possible mechanisms for this reaction seems extremely interesting both theoretically and phenomenologically .    a simultaneous analysis of these two mechanisms in the production of a vector - meson pair",
    "was carried out in @xcite .",
    "the authors found that these mechanisms can be selected by means of the different polarizations of the initial - state photon . in the case of ( pseudo)scalar particles , like the pions , this effect is absent and , therefore , this opens up a window of opportunity to access the overlap region of both mechanisms and their duality as opposed to their additivity .",
    "by duality we mean here that adding the contributions of the two mechanisms would lead to a double - counting .",
    "hence , these mechanisms are in antagonism to each other and should be considered as two alternative ways to describe the same physics .    in this paper , we will verify the possibility for duality between the two different mechanisms of factorization , associated either with gdas , or with tdas , in the regime where _ both _",

    "we start our analysis with the factorization of a two - photon process in which the two photons undergo a fusion with the subsequent creation of two pions . for the sake of simplicity , we work first in the scalar euclidean @xmath0 model , regarding it as a sort of a toy model in order to prepare the ground for the real qcd application to follow in the subsequent section .    the most convenient way to analyze this four - particle amplitude in the @xmath0 model is to work within the @xmath15-representation , following the lines of thought given in @xcite in the discussion of deeply virtual compton scattering .",
    "the reason is that within this representation ( i ) the calculations can be performed in a systematic way , not only at one loop but also at higher - loop levels , ( ii ) the factorization of the process can be studied in detail , and ( iii ) one can study the spectral properties of the nonperturbative input ( gpds , gdas ) because these properties are insensitive to the numerators of the quark and gluon propagators .",
    "in addition , complications owing to the spin structure do not affect them .",

[ fig01](c ) ) ) can be related to the scalar gda via @xmath57 * regime ( c ) * + the most important regime for our investigations on duality is when it happens that both variables @xmath3 and @xmath13 are simultaneously small compared to @xmath2 ( but still much larger than the soft scale @xmath17 ) : @xmath58 .",
    "the question which may arise in this case is what happens with factorization . in other words",
    ", can the asymptotic formula be useful even in this case ?    in investigating this issue ,",
    "we face two different options .",
    "_ option 1 _ + start with , say , the regime ( a ) , since there is no doubt that the asymptotic formula ( or the factorization ) can be applied to both regimes ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we begin by considering the integrand of ( [ amp - beta ] ) in terms of the two variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "then , we tune the value of the variable @xmath59 down to small enough values in order to understand the behavior of the integrand in this regime .",
    "we originally designed the integrand of ( [ amp - beta ] ) for @xmath59 assuming values within the set @xmath60 , but for our purposes it is necessary to study the special case of @xmath61 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . from this graphics",
    "we see that the support of the considered function contains now two wings from which the function becomes saturated .",
    "note that the @xmath37- and @xmath38-wings are the same in this case and that both wings are equally essential .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that the integration in ( [ amp - beta ] ) over the regions 1 , 3 , and 4 ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 wings ) , i.e. , @xmath62 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provides approximately a @xmath63 contribution to the exact amplitude in this regime .",
    "therefore , the saturation of the exact amplitude ( [ amp - beta ] ) in regime ( c ) results from contributions originating from both wings @xmath37 and @xmath38 . hence , restricting attention to only one of them is not permissible . in this sense",
    ", we deal with a particular case of `` additivity '' of the two wings .",
    "_ option 2 _ + however , there exists an alternative way to determine the exact amplitude , based on the analytic integration of ( [ amp - beta ] ) in @xmath32 space .",
    "namely , we may continue the asymptotic formula ( [ asymgda - beta ] ) , obtained within regime ( a ) , to regime ( c ) , where @xmath59 and @xmath41 are the same ( or approximately the same ) .",
    "then , we will observe that the asymptotic formula ( [ asymgda - beta ] ) still describes the amplitude @xmath64 with an acceptable accuracy , still slightly overestimating the exact amplitude ( [ amp - beta ] ) .",
    "this becomes evident by analyzing the ratio ( [ r1 ] ) in terms of @xmath59 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - rat-1 ] .",
    "one sees that the large @xmath13-tail of ratio ( [ r1 ] ) is actually well - described by the findings in regime ( a ) . at the same time , when we go to the regime where @xmath13 is small or of the same order as @xmath3 , the asymptotic formula ( [ asymgda - beta])which was continued from regime ( a)describes even in this case the exact amplitude with a tolerable @xmath65 deviation .",
    "indeed , in the small @xmath13 region , the ratio ( [ r1 ] ) increases from approximately @xmath66 to about @xmath67 at @xmath68 .",
    "hence , we may conclude that , despite the fact that the exact amplitude ( [ amp - beta ] ) in regime ( c ) is saturated from contributions stemming from both wings @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the asymptotic formula ( [ asymgda - beta ] ) , derived in regime ( a ) and continued to regime ( c ) , is still suitable for an acceptable approximation of the exact amplitude .    due to the symmetry of regimes ( a ) and ( b ) under the exchange of the variables @xmath69 ,",
    "a similar statement is valid as regards the asymptotic formula derived in regime ( b)cf .",
    "( [ tdaas ] ) .",
    "therefore , in regime ( c ) , the asymptotic expression ( [ asymgda - beta ] ) still remains a good approximation of the exact amplitude , so that one does not have to reestimate it using as an alternative eq .",
    "( [ tdaas ] ) . insisting to do so",
    ", one would face a `` double - counting '' problem .",
    "thus , in this sense , we deal with duality between ( [ asymgda - beta ] ) and ( [ tdaas ] ) .",
    "note that this duality is not a result of the symmetry between regimes ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this symmetry merely simplifies the analysis of regime ( b ) .",
    "since the derivation of the asymptotic formula resembles the factorization procedure for the given amplitude ( in which the asymptotic formula plays the role of the partonic part ) , the gda and tda factorizations within the @xmath70-model in regime ( c ) are equivalent to each other without a kinematical or dynamical prevalence of one over the other .",
    "this can be interpreted as a sort of duality between the gda and tda factorizations .    in concluding this discussion ,",
    "let us stress that there is a difference between the two possible ways of factorization , which are usually considered to be equivalent , because , there is either dominance of some parts of the full integration region , see ( [ regc - exc ] ) , or the application of the asymptotic ( partonic ) formula , see ( [ app - reg - c ] ) can ( approximately ) describe the exact process amplitude . in the case of regime ( c ) , the first way of factorization implies additivity of the two wings .",
    "alternatively , the continuation of the asymptotic ( partonic ) expressions gives rise to duality between them .",
    ", see ( [ r1 ] ) , as a function of @xmath59.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "in the preceding section , we demonstrated how the duality between the gda and the tda - factorization works within a toy model .",
    "we now study the duality phenomenon in the case of real qcd . to this end , we consider the exclusive @xmath72 production in a @xmath73 collision , where the virtual photon with a large virtuality @xmath2 is longitudinally polarized , whereas the other one is quasi real and transversely polarized .",
    "as already mentioned , the key feature of this process is that it exhibits two different kinds of factorization , based , respectively , on the gda or the tda mechanism ( see fig .",
    "[ gdavstda ] ) , with a potential overlap of both mechanisms in the kinematical regime where @xmath13 and @xmath3 are small .",
    "notice that this situation differs from the cases studied in @xcite , where the additivity of the gda and the tda factorizations was explored and found that each factorization mechanism can be selected on account of the helicity of the particles .",
    "in contrast , in our case , the gda and the tda regimes correspond to the _ same _ helicity amplitudes , resembling the situation faced in the scalar case considered in the preceding section where there is only one helicity amplitude . to continue , let us recall the parametrization of nonperturbative matrix elements entering our analysis .",
    "because the considered process involves a longitudinally and a transversally polarized photon , we have to deal with twist-3 parametrizing functions .",
    "to this end , we adhere to @xcite , where the genuine twist-@xmath1 contributions in the @xmath71 process were studied in detail ( see , also , @xcite ) . as regards the twist-2 contribution , related to the meson da , we use the standard parametrization of the @xmath74-to - vacuum matrix element which involves a bilocal axial - vector quark operator @xcite .    on the other hand ,",

    "since @xmath136 corresponds to the two - pion state with @xmath137 and our gdas probe only the isoscalar channel , we derive for @xmath136 at @xmath138 in the region of the @xmath139-meson [ @xmath140 mass the following expression : @xmath141 where @xmath142 , and the decay constant @xmath143 is defined by @xmath144 in addition , we also model the function @xmath136 with the help of the most simple ansatz ( see , @xcite ) @xmath145 where @xmath146 denotes the fraction of momentum carried by the quarks and antiquarks in the pion . in our numerical analysis",
    "below , we use for this fraction @xmath147 , which is taken from the leading - order glck - reya - schienbein approximation ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    before continuing with the numerical analysis ,",
    "let us pause for a moment to discuss the validity and self - consistency of the approximations made",
    ". start with the pion da : for simplicity , the asymptotic pion da in eq.([eq : hatda ] ) was used .",
    "using other pion das @xcite , the contribution from the tda factorization may increase from about @xmath148 for the bms model @xcite to approximately @xmath149 for the cz model @xcite .",
    "second , continue with the gda : at the level of accuracy relevant for our arguments , we used for the twist-2 gda @xmath150 the asymptotic form , the justification being provided by quark - hadron duality arguments given in @xcite .",
    "third , we assumed the wandzura - wilczek approximation , which relies upon the assumption of the smallness of the genuine twist-3 contributions .",
    "this assumption is supported by measurements of the @xmath151 structure function .",
    "the normalization of the gda is determined by the momentum conservation which is rigorously valid . by performing a crossing from gpds ( where momentum conservation applies ) to the gda channel",
    ", we used the improved expression ( [ b12 ] ) accounting for meson dynamics .",
    "turn to the tda : the first ingredient is the normalization ( [ norma ] ) , which is fixed by the data for the pion weak decay ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    "finally , for the form of the tda , we used a parametrization [ cf .",
    "( [ tdaansatz ] ) ] , which can accommodate different available models @xcite , within the range of accuracy of the order of 10% , the latter pertaining to our whole numerical analysis .",
    "we calculated both functions @xmath152 and @xmath125 and show the obtained results in fig .",
    "[ fig - tda - gda1 ] for @xmath153 ( which corresponds to the lattice result of @xcite ) and employing for simplicity the asymptotic pion da .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the function @xmath152 , where we have adjusted the free parameters to @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the results , obtained for rather small values of these parameters , are displayed by the broken lines in the same figures .",
    "the dotted line denotes the function @xmath152 with @xmath156 and @xmath157 , whereas the dash - dotted line employs @xmath158 and @xmath159 . for comparison",
    ", we also include the results for the @xmath125 . in that latter case",
    ", the dense - dotted line corresponds to the gda amplitude , where the expression for @xmath136 has been estimated via eq .",
    "( [ b12 ] ) , while the solid line represents the simplest ansatz ( [ bsimp ] ) with @xmath147 .",
    "the particular values of the coefficients @xmath160 , we used , are within the fiducial intervals specified above in conjunction with eq.([tdaansatz ] ) .",
    "if , for example , we would have used instead values of these parameters outside their fiducial intervals , then the outcome would change by orders of magnitude and duality would be badly violated .    from this figure",
    "one may infer that ( i ) in the case when the parameter @xmath136 ( which parametrizes the gda contribution ) is estimated with the aid of the breit - wigner formula , see ( [ b12 ] ) , and , while @xmath161 , there is duality between the gda and the tda factorization mechanisms .",
    "hence , the model for @xmath136 which takes into account the corresponding resonances can be selected by duality .",
    "( ii ) in the case of the simplest model for @xmath136 , evaluated for @xmath147 ( see , ( [ bsimp ] ) ) , the duality between the gda and the tda factorization mechanisms reaches maximally the level of @xmath162 , provided the axial - vector tdas are normalized in terms of the axial form factor @xmath163 . on that basis",
    ", one may conclude that the simplest model for @xmath136 is rather inconsistent with duality and can not be considered as a realistic option .",
    "the process amplitude for the fusion of a highly virtual , but small @xmath3 photon ( longitudinally polarized ) , with a quasi real one ( with a transversal polarization ) can be factorized in two different ways .",
    "the study of this process within a toy @xmath70 model has shown the existence of duality between the factorization along the @xmath3-channel and the @xmath13-channel  which serve to simulate , respectively , the gda and the tda factorization mechanisms in qcd .",
    "this observation persists also in the case of such reactions in real qcd .",
    "indeed , the amplitude for the process @xmath71 can be factorized in two distinct ways , having recourse to the large virtuality of one of the photons involved , as compared to the scales of the soft interactions .",
    "as mentioned before , depending on the variables @xmath3 and @xmath13 , two different mechanisms for this reaction were identified . the first factorization mechanism , which employs gdas , takes place when @xmath29 , while @xmath13 is of the order of @xmath2 . on the other side , when it happens that @xmath30 and @xmath164 , the tda mechanism of factorization becomes dominant in such a @xmath165 collision .",
    "we have shown that when both variables @xmath3 and @xmath13 are simultaneously much smaller than @xmath2 in the collision of a real and transversely polarized photon with a highly virtual longitudinally polarized photon in the pion - pair production , then both types of factorization are possible giving rise to duality in this region .",
    "we have shown that when it happens that both mandelstam variables @xmath3 and @xmath13 are much less than the large momentum scale @xmath2 , with the variables @xmath127 and @xmath166 varying in the interval @xmath167 , then the tda and the gda factorization mechanisms are equivalent to each other and operate in parallel .",
    "this marks a crucial difference between our approach and previous ones @xcite which dealt with the additivity of the tda and the gda factorization mechanisms .",
    "note that the presented results were obtained using rigorous constraints and available nonperturbative models for the das , gdas , and the tdas .",
    "we found that duality appears only for values of the model parameters within their fiducial intervals , associated with each particular model .",
    "therefore , we demonstrated that duality may serve as a tool for selecting suitable models for the non - perturbative ingredients of qcd factorization of various exclusive amplitudes .",
    "we also observed that twist-3 gdas appear to be dual to the convolutions of leading - twist tdas and das , multiplied by a qcd effective coupling  the latter stemming from the hard - gluon exchange .",
    "this reflects at the level of the particular process , we are considering , the manifestation of duality for the gpds and gdas themselves @xcite . one may ask to which extent the observed duality between different qcd factorization mechanisms is an exceptional finding or rather represents a generic feature of qcd dynamics . in this connection , one may recall the different ways of describing single - spin asymmetries ( ssa ) using either twist-3 collinear factorization @xcite or by employing the transverse - momentum dependent ( tmd ) sivers distribution function @xcite .",
    "because of the t - odd nature of the ssa and the sivers function , the latter may emerge only due to the interactions between the hard and the soft parts @xcite of the process and represents an effective distribution @xcite .",
    "moreover , its transverse moment is related @xcite to a particular twist-3 matrix element .",
    "this sort of relation may be explored @xcite as a matching procedure ( or , in our language , as duality ) between tmd factorization at low @xmath168 , on one hand , and collinear twist-3 factorization at large @xmath168 , on the other .",
    "recently @xcite , such a matching procedure was carried out in detail for various observables and it was found that duality strongly depends on the type of the considered observable . in the case of the sivers function , there is a possibility of enlarging the duality intervals by either using the twist-3 approach at low @xmath168 @xcite or by applying the sivers function at large @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "the latter procedure finds justification in the framework of the twist-3 factorization , provided only the first non - vanishing transverse moment of the sivers function is retained and that color factors , responsible for the effective nature of the sivers function , are properly taken into account .    duality also emerges when another type of qcd factorization in semi - inclusive processes is considered , which makes use of so - called fracture functions .",
    "the momentum conservation guarantees that the description in terms of either fragmentation or fracture functions is complete and one should have duality between these two mechanisms in the overlap region ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "bottom line : we have shown that duality leads to new insights into a number of phenomena in qcd , in particular to those related to exclusive processes and spin - dependent quantities .",
