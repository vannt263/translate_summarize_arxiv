    "sec : simulation ] ) .",
    "the agreement is rather good , except for the region just right of the injection hole , where the data is well above the simulation .",
    "this is , however , believed to be an artifact of the measurement process as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : intens_meas ] .",
    "several features are visible in the projections .",
    "the step at the center of the horizontal distribution originates from the horizontal injection angle @xmath23 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : incoupling ] ) : the light will first travel to the right , and several loss mechanisms reduce the intensity before the light arrives in the left part of the cavity : finite mirror reflectivity , possible imperfections at the transition from the flat to the cylindrical end piece of mirror # 1 , and the losses at the injection hole after half a roundtrip .    the higher intensity at both ends of the horizontal distribution can be understood in a ray optics picture : a ray arriving at the cylindrical end piece with an angle @xmath23 will gradually reduce its angle in the cylindrical region until it eventually `` turns around '' .",
    "this however results in an increased intensity , as the ray undergoes more reflections ( per mm ) at the turning point .",
    "the same effect leads to the double - peak structure observed in the vertical intensity distribution : a ray initially traveling downwards at an angle @xmath6 will gradually reduce its angle , perform more reflections per unit distance close to the lower turning point , but quickly traverse the central part of the mirror .",
    "this has the beneficial side - effect that the losses through the injection hole are smaller than expected from the average fluence inside the illuminated volume .",
    "robustness against mirror misalignments was one of the design goals of the cavity . in our experiment",
    "@xcite we aligned the cavity mirrors and the injection optics ( oap ) by measuring the storage time of the light ( 6@xmath0 wavelength ) inside the cavity .",
    "the alignment procedure consists of aligning the mirrors by eye and final optimization of the storage time by tilting the mirrors .",
    "the first alignment does not have to be very accurate since the light with a wide range of angles is confined between the mirrors .",
    "we closed and evacuated the setup and switched on a high magnetic field of 5 t .",
    "no remote - controlled or active mirror stabilization was employed .",
    "still , no mirror misalignment was observed over the course of a few weeks .",
    "this robustness originates from the small curvature radii of the employed cylinders : the 10 mm long cylindrical end pieces of mirror # 1 with @xmath17 mm can capture light up to ( horizontal ) angles @xmath23 of roughly 160mrad .",
    "this corresponds to maximally allowed mirror misalignments of about @xmath27mrad ( around the vertical axis ) , as the rays accumulate twice the mirror misalignment on each reflection of the misaligned mirror . for such enormous misalignments the light will only illuminate half of the enclosed volume , though .",
    "measurements of very misaligned cavity mirrors can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilted_aug ] , together with simulations that describe the data quite well . here ,",
    "we tilted one of the mirrors by up to 0.45mrad , corresponding to 85@xmath0 displacement over the mirror length of 190 mm . still , three quarters of the cavity volume are filled with light , and no light is lost .",
    "vertical misalignments , i.e.  rotation around the long axes of the mirrors , are much less critical . such a mirror tilt is equivalent to a vertical displacement of the cylindrical mirror # 2 .",
    "the effect is hence only a vertical displacement of the illuminated volume .",
    "the strongly focusing cylindrical mirror ensures light confinement for vertical mirror tilts up to 10mrad in the geometry presented here .",
    "the intensity distribution was simulated using a simple ray - optics simulation .",
    "the simulation included the full geometry , including the possibility of misaligned mirrors .",
    "it turns out that , for the curvature radii presented here , it is not necessary to take into account the exact reflection point in 3 dimensions between a ray and the curved and possibly tilted mirror surfaces",
    ". the cavity presented here could as well have been simulated by calculating the intersection of rays with flat mirrors and taking the curvature into account only for the reflection angle .",
    "also , a simulation of gaussian beams in the vertical dimension , propagated using abcd - matrices , did not produce very different results .",
    "the simulation used about @xmath28 rays .",
    "their initial position and angle in the injection hole were distributed according to the assumed gaussian tem@xmath29 mode of the injected laser beam .",
    "a simulation takes about a minute on a typical contemporary pc .",
    "the simulation created the intensity profile on various planes parallel to the mirrors , as well as the time spectrum of the light leaving the cavity through the injection hole .",
    "this light was also used in the experiment to monitor adequate light confinement .",
    "interference effects are not expected to be important .",
    "the injected light is strongly focused , giving a large variety of ray angles .",
    "after a few roundtrips , every point receives light from many different directions .",
    "cavity  a was used for measuring the light distribution between the mirrors .",
    "a laser diode emitting light at 850 nm was used for these measurements .",
    "although the reflective coating is optimized for a wavelength of 6@xmath0 , it has a sufficiently high reflectivity of more than 99.9% around 850 nm .",
    "simulations showed that the distribution inside the cavity can be well estimated using ray optics with only minor influence of the laser wavelength .",
    "the intensity distribution inside the cavity is measured by recording the light scattered from a thin wire ( 25@xmath0 diameter ) which is moved along the long axis of the cavity mirrors .",
    "a video of the wire moving at constant velocity is recorded .",
    "the video is then converted into a single image by taking the maximum value recorded per pixel .    in general",
    ", the 25@xmath0 diameter of the wire is small enough to not severeley affect the light confinement . as mentioned above",
    ", we do nt expect intensity variations on very small length scales , as interference is not expected to play a relevant role .",
    "the finite diameter of the wire does however have an influence on measurement of the light distribution , causing artifacts like an overestimated intensity of the injected light and an apparent constriction of the illuminated volume next to the injection hole ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flat ] ) . here",
    ", the injected light is still well collimated , and the wire can scatter a large fraction of the light .",
    "cavity  c used to measure several transition frequencies in muonic helium ions  @xcite at wavelengths @xmath30$]nm . here",
    ", photo diodes ( pd ) have been used for online monitoring of the intensity distribution .",
    "each pd is connected to a @xmath31 mm long optical multi - mode fiber with a core diameter of a few hundred @xmath0 .",
    "six of these pd - fiber - assemblies have been mounted in the support of the cylindrical mirror # 2 , and detect the light transmitted through the hr coating .",
    "four fibers are mounted close to the corners of the desired light distribution ( i.e.  at y=@xmath32 mm in height , and z=@xmath33 mm along the beam axis ) .",
    "the intensity distribution can be easily optimized by equalizing and maximizing the signal on all 4 pds simultaneously .",
    "this enables us to optimize both the cavity mirror tilts and the light injection angle within a few minutes .",
    "two additional pd - fiber - assemblies monitor the light on the axis of the cavity ( i.e  at height y=0 ) where most of the atoms are .",
    "the multi - mode fiber is used to limit both the light intensity experienced by the pds and the field - of - view of each detector , thereby increasing the sensitivity to misalignments .",
    "the full simulation agrees very well with the measured intensity distribution and the lifetime of the light escaping through the injection hole .    however , already a simple estimate gives the average laser fluence achieved by the mirror setup : the laser light at @xmath34@xmath0 illuminates a region with an area of @xmath35mm@xmath9 .",
    "the losses are as follows : the mirror reflectivity or @xmath36% results in @xmath37 per reflection .",
    "the injection hole with a diameter of 0.63 mm creates losses of @xmath38 every _ second _ reflection ( i.e.  for each reflection on mirror # 1 ) .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath39 arises from the reduced laser fluence at the entrance hole location ( cavity axis ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : flat ] and sec .  [",
    "sec : intens_general ] .",
    "the two gaps of @xmath40@xmath0 width between the flat and the cylindrical parts of mirror # 1 result in losses of @xmath41 every other reflection .    hence , the total losses _ per reflection _ are @xmath42 .",
    "this results in an average of @xmath43 reflections .    with a mirror spacing of 25 mm ( 12 reflections per nanosecond )",
    "this should result in a light confinement lifetime of @xmath44ns , in good agreement with the value measured in cavity  b at @xmath34@xmath0 ( fig .",

    "we achieved an accuracy of about 1mrad in the ideal case .",
