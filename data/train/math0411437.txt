    "<S> in this note , we discuss the quantum hele - shaw flow , a random measure process in the complex plane introduced by the physicists p.wiegmann , a. zabrodin , et al . </S>",
    "<S> this process arises in the theory of electronic droplets confined to a plane under a strong magnetic field , as well as in the theory of random normal matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we extend a result of elbau and felder @xcite to general external field potentials , and also show that if the potential is @xmath0-smooth , then the quantum hele - shaw flow converges , under appropriate scaling , to the classical ( weighted ) hele - shaw flow , which can be modeled in terms of an obstacle problem . </S>"
