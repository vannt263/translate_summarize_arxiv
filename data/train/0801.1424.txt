    "contribution of long - range dispersive van der waals forces to the interaction between two molecules is quite significant .",
    "these forces play an important role in the description of many physical and chemical phenomena .",
    "some of these are adhesion , surface tension , physical adsorption @xcite , chemistry of rare gases @xcite , molecular chemistry in the interstellar medium @xcite etc .. the correlation between the electron density fluctuation at widely separated locations give rise to these forces . the van waals interaction between two molecules a and b in the lowest order",
    "is represented by the orientationally averaged potential @xmath1 where r is the intermolecular distance and c@xmath2 is the orientationally averaged van der waals coefficient .",
    "the coefficient c@xmath2 describes the dipole - dipole interactions between the two molecular species .",
    "metal clusters , specifically those of alkali atoms na and k , played an important role in the development of cluster physics as a branch of modern physics and chemistry .",
    "the knowledge of their van der waals coefficient @xmath0 is useful for the description of cluster - cluster collisions @xcite and also for characterizing the orientation of clusters in the bulk matter @xcite .",
    "however , only very few papers devoted to the calculation of van der waals coefficients exist in the literature . in refs .",
    "@xcite , time dependent kohn - sham ( tdks ) equation of time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) within the spherical jellium background model ( sjbm ) was employed to calculate the van der waals coefficients . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a purely particle- and current - density based hydrodynamic formalism of tddft within sjbm has been applied to calculate the coefficients .",
    "this model is well suited for the description of the alkali metal clusters ( li , na , and k ) and correctly explains the greater stability of these clusters with magic number 2 , 8 , 20 , 34 , 40 , @xmath3 of atoms due to closing of the electronic shell @xcite .",
    "although the hydrodynamic approach is less accurate than the tdks approach due to the approximate nature of the kinetic energy functional employed in it , nonetheless it is computationally advantageous for larger clusters in comparison to the orbital - based tdks approach .",
    "the sjbm replaces the discrete ionic structure of clusters by a spherically symmetric uniform positive charge background and thus making it possible to carry out calculations for the optical response properties of reasonably large clusters of around 100 atoms within the tdks approach @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this the hydrodynamic approach in conjunction with sjbm allows calculation of optical response properties of very large alkali atom clusters containing 10,000 atoms without much difficulty @xcite .",
    "in past ten years or so , several all - electron _ ab initio _ calculations devoted to the ground state and the optical response properties of sodium clusters taking into account the actual geometrical arrangement of the sodium atoms have also been reported in the literature @xcite . however , these calculations are restricted to small sized clusters containing maximum up to 20 sodium atoms . moreover , these calculations are computationally more expensive and require substantially more resources than the jellium based calculations .",
    "it is only very recently that the all - electron _ ab initio _ calculations of the van der waals coefficient c@xmath2 of small sized closed shell sodium clusters containing up to 20 atoms have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to make a systematic comparison of the values of c@xmath2 obtained by employing the jellium based model and all - electron _ ab initio _ method within the tddft .",
    "this comparison will enable us to assess the accuracy of jellium model in predicting the values of van der waals coefficient and such a study is important , as the jellium model often turns out to be much more efficient to handle particularly when dealing with larger cluster systems .    before proceeding further",
    ", it is important to note that density functional theory ( dft ) in principle should give the exact ground - state properties including the long range van der waals energies .",
    "however , the widely used local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) @xcite exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals fail to reproduce the van der waals energies .",
    "this is because the lda and gga xc functionals can not completely simulate the correlated motion of electrons arising from coulomb interaction between distant non overlapping electronic systems .",
    "it is only recently that attempts @xcite have been made to obtain van der waals energies directly from the ground - state energy functional by correcting the long range nature of the effective kohn - sham potential . on the other hand , it is possible to make reliable estimates of the van der waals coefficient @xmath0 by using expressions which relate this coefficient to the frequency dependent dipole polarizabilities at imaginary frequencies @xcite .",
    "we follow the latter route for the calculation of these coefficients .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the theoretical method and the expressions employed to calculate the van der waals coefficient @xmath0 from the frequency dependent dipole polarizability .",
    "results of our calculations are presented in section iii .",
    "the paper is concluded in section iv .",
    "in order to calculate the van der waals coefficient @xmath0 , we make use of the casimir - polder expression which relates @xmath0 to the frequency dependent dipole polarizability evaluated at imaginary frequency . in accordance with this expression",
    "the orientation averaged dispersion coefficient between two molecules a and b is given by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the isotropic average dipole polarizability of the j - th molecule and is given by @xmath6 in the above expression @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are diagonal elements of the dipole polarizability tensor .",
    "therefore , the calculation of dispersion coefficient @xmath0 involves determining frequency dependent dipole polarizability tensor followed by the evaluation of the quadrature . for",
    "the determination of the frequency dependent polarizability , we use two different methods ( i ) the hydrodynamic formalism of tddft in conjunction with the sjbm and ( ii ) all - electron _ ab initio _ method also in the realm of tddft . for details ,",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for the hydrodynamic formalism and ref .",
    "@xcite for the _ ab initio _ method of calculation . in the following ,",
    "we describe the choice of parameters made in this paper to perform the calculations of the dispersion coefficient c@xmath2 by two methods .",
    "the basic idea of the sjbm is to replace the distribution of ionic cores by a constant spherically symmetric positive background of jellium density @xmath10 in a finite volume .",
    "this positive background provides the attractive potential for the valence electrons contributed by each atom of the cluster .",
    "the ground - state electronic distribution is then obtained by employing either orbital based kohn - sham or purely density based extended thomas - fermi ( etf ) formalisms of dft .",
    "the calculation of the frequency dependent polarizabilty within the sjbm can be accomplished by tddft . like its time independent counterpart tddft can be formulated either in terms of the time dependent orbitals ( tdks formalism ) or in terms of the particle and the current densities ( hydrodynamic formalism ) . in this paper",
    ", we employ the hydrodynamic approach formalism of tddft in conjunction with the sjbm to calculate the frequency dependent polarizabilities at imaginary frequencies .",
    "the basic dynamical variables of the hydrodynamic theory are the time - dependent density @xmath11 and the velocity potential @xmath12 .",
    "the velocity of the electron fluid is given by @xmath13 .",
    "thus the total time - averaged energy can be expressed in terms of these two variables . for our purpose",
    "we need to evaluate the second - order change in the time - averaged energy as this is related directly to the frequency dependent average dipole polarizability by the relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field .",
    "it has been shown that the second - order change in the time - average energy @xmath16 is stationary with respect to the variations in the first - order induced density @xmath17 and the induced current - density @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath16 can be determined by choosing appropriate variational forms for @xmath17 and @xmath19 and making @xmath20 stationary with respect to the parameters of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for our calculations we use ten parameters",
    "each for @xmath17 and @xmath18 and check the convergence by adding more parameters .",
    "the variational method is also applicable for the imaginary frequencies @xcite as it requires replacing @xmath21 by @xmath22 in the expression of @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to determine dynamic multipolarizability at imaginary frequencies ( @xmath23 ) by exactly the same procedure as employed for getting @xmath24 .",
    "it is well known that a tddft based response property calculation requires approximating the xc functional at two different levels .",
    "the first one is the static xc potential needed to calculate the ground - state density of the system .",
    "the second approximation is needed to represent the xc kernel @xmath25 which determines the xc contribution to the screening of an applied field . for the xc kernel",
    ", we use reasonably accurate adiabatic local density approximation ( alda ) @xcite . on the other hand , for static xc energy",
    "functional we use the dirac exchange energy functional @xcite and gunnarsson - lundqvist ( gl ) @xcite parametrized form for the correlation energy functional within the lda .",
    "in addition to approximating the xc energy functional , the calculation of polarizability by the hydrodynamical approach of tddft also requires approximating the non - interacting kinetic energy functional @xmath26 $ ] also .",
    "we choose the von weizsacker @xcite form for @xmath26 $ ] , which is given as @xmath27 = \\frac{1}{8}\\int\\frac{{\\bf\\nabla}\\rho\\cdot{\\bf\\nabla}\\rho } { \\rho}d{\\bf r}. \\label{14}\\ ] ] the von weiszacker functional is well suited for the description of response properties of closed shell metal clusters @xcite .    in the present paper the ground - state densities @xmath28 of clusters",
    "are obtained by employing purely density - based etf @xcite method within the sjbm of metal clusters .      to carry out the all - electron _ ab initio _ calculation of the frequency dependent polarizabilities of the clusters , we employ the adf program package @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed description of the method adopted in this package for obtaining the frequency dependent polarizabilities . in this",
    "package calculations of electronic and response properties of molecules are carried by using slater type orbital ( sto ) basis sets .",
    "it is well known that for accurate calculations of response properties it is necessary to have large basis sets with both polarization and diffuse functions . for our purpose ,",
    "we choose all electron even tempered basis set et - qz3p-2diffuse with two sets of diffuse functions consisting of ( 11s,9p,7d,3f ) functions for na atom .",
    "the application of basis set with diffuse functions often leads to the problem of linear dependencies .",
    "such problem have been circumvented by removing linear combinations of functions corresponding to small eigenvalues of the overlap matrix .",
    "we expect that the size of the chosen basis set will make our results very close to the basis - set limit .",
    "once the average polarizability at imaginary frequencies are obtained then the casimir - polder integral eq .",
    "( [ casimirpolder ] ) is evaluated by employing thirty point gauss - chebyshev quadrature scheme as described in ref .",
    "the convergence of the results has been checked by increasing number of frequency points .",
    "like sjbm based calculations , all the _ ab initio _ calculations in the present paper are performed with the alda for the xc kernel . on the other hand , for the static xc potential needed to calculate the ground - state orbitals and their energies , we employ the lda potential as parametrized by vosko , wilk and nussair ( vwn ) @xcite .",
    "we note here that both gl and vwn forms for the xc potential use the same dirac exchange energy functional @xcite but the parameterization for the correlation part is different .",
    "we expect that this difference in the correlation energy functional will lead to a significantly smaller deviation in the results obtained via the _ ab initio _ and sjbm calculations than the discrepancy arising due to the consideration of the actual geometrical structure of the clusters in the _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "furthermore , in order to perform _ ab initio _ calculation of response properties we need to choose the ground - state geometries of clusters . for the dimer @xmath29",
    ", we use the experimental bond length 3.0786 @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "for larger clusters ( 4- to 20-atom clusters ) we use the structures which are obtained via geometry optimization calculation with triple-@xmath31 plus two polarization functions ( tz2p ) basis set and becke - perdew ( bp86 ) xc potential @xcite .",
    "all the optimizations are carried out with the convergence criteria for the norm of energy gradient and energy fixed at @xmath32a.u and @xmath33a.u , respectively .",
    "the optimized structures obtained by us are in agreement with the corresponding results of refs .",
    "@xcite . in case of a cluster having more than one isomers",
    "we choose the one possessing the lowest energy for our calculations of the dipole polarizability . here",
    "we note that our geometry optimization calculation for the cluster containing 20 sodium atoms yields lower energy for the structure with c@xmath34 symmetry than the one with t@xmath35 symmetry .",
    "this is in contrast to the result of ref .",
    "the next section is devoted to the discussion of results for the dispersion coefficient @xmath0 obtained by employing the above two methods .",
    ".comparison of dispersion coefficient @xmath0 ( in atomic units ) for pairs of similar sodium clusters obtained with the all - electron _ ab initio _ and sjbm calculations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     having assessed the accuracy of results obtained within the sjbm , we now focus our attention on the study of relationship between c@xmath2 and @xmath36 . in the so - called london approximation",
    "the van der waals coefficient c@xmath2 between two similar molecules can be represented in terms of the static polarizability @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the effective or characteristic frequency of the system .",
    "the above expression ( eq .",
    "( [ londondispersion ] ) ) is obtained with the single pole approximation for the frequency dependent polarizability , which assumes that all the transitions can be replaced by only one effective transition .",
    "this is also known as london dispersion formula and it provides a way to correlate the van der waals coefficient with the static polarizability . in doing",
    "so the accuracy of c@xmath2 crucially depends on the precision with which the static polarizability is calculated .    in order to study this correlation",
    ", we calculate the average static polarizability of sodium clusters by the _ ab initio _ method and sjbm - hydrodynamic approach .",
    "another reason for carrying out static polarizability calculations is that unlike c@xmath2 , a fairly large number of experimental results on the static polarizabilty exist in the literature @xcite , which allows us to compare our results with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the results of the polarizability calculations are shown in fig . 2 along with the experimental results of ref .",
    "2 clearly shows that both _",
    "ab initio _ and sjbm results are lower than the corresponding experimental data , however , the _ ab initio _ results are closer to the experimental data than the sjbm results . moreover , it is seen from this figure that like c@xmath2 , the deviation between the sjbm and _ ab initio _ results is minimum for magic number clusters and these deviations decrease with the larger clusters .",
    "for example , the difference between the two results is 20@xmath39 ( _",
    "ab initio _ number is 233.32 a.u . ) for the dimer , whereas the differnce reduces to around 11@xmath39 ( _ ab initio _ number is 1752.8 a.u . ) for the na@xmath40 cluster . for non - magic number clusters the differnce is more and but reduces with the increase in the size of the clusters .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the static polarizability of large size clusters can also be obtained quite accurately by employing the sjbm - hydrodynamic approach with substantially less amount of computational effort .",
    "the van der waals coefficient @xmath0 for sodium atom clusters containing even number of atoms ranging from 2 to 20 atoms have been calculated by employing all - electron _ ab initio _ method and the sjbm - hydrodynamic formalism within the realm of tddft .",
    "the calculations are performed with the lda xc potentials .",
    "the van der waals coefficient is obtained by using casimir - polder expression which requires frequency dependent dipole polarizabilties of the two interacting species at imaginary frequencies .",
    "these are calculated by the all - electron _ ab initio _ and the sjbm - hydrodynamic methods of tddft .",
    "the results of these two calculations are compared to ascertain the effect of ionic structure of the clusters on the van der waals coefficient .",
    "we find that the differences between the results of all - electron _ ab initio _ and sjbm - hydrodynamic calculations are minimum for magic number clusters and these differences decrease with the increase in the number of atoms present in the clusters . even for non - magic number clusters",
    ", we find that sjbm - hydrodynamic calculations lead to results which are very close to the corresponding _ ab initio _ numbers . from these results , we conclude that for clusters larger than na@xmath41 detailed ionic structure of the clusters does not have much effect on the results for the van der waals coefficient and also on their static polarizability .",
    "this is an important results as carrying out _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for the optical response properties of large clusters is very expensive .",
    "this paper shows that for such systems sjbm based methods within tddft can yield quite accurate results for the van der waals coefficient .",
