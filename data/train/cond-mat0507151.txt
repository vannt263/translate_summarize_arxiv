    "superconductivity in mgb@xmath2 near 40 k @xcite has attracted much interest due to its potential for applications in the 20 - 30 k range .",
    "the low upper critical field @xcite and high anisotropy ratio , @xmath8=h@xmath9/h@xmath10 @xcite , of pure mgb@xmath2 , limit its potential usefulness @xcite .",
    "carbon doping of mgb@xmath2 has been shown to be an effective method for enhancing h@xmath7 @xcite while simultaneously decreasing the anisotropy ratio by increasing h@xmath10 more rapidly than h@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "carbon doped mgb@xmath2 filaments require high reaction temperatures which lead to large grain sizes and poor j@xmath6 values , in spite of the enhancements in h@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "reports of successful fabrication of superconducting wire using powder - in - tube processing @xcite , coupled with the fact that j@xmath6 values in powder samples can readily be increased by the addition of various particles @xcite motivate a desire for synthesizing single phase carbon doped mgb@xmath2 powder .",
    "carbon doped bulk polycrystalline mgb@xmath2 with approximately 10% carbon incorporation has previously been synthesized by mixing elemental mg and the binary b@xmath3c @xcite .",
    "systematic carbon doping of mg(b@xmath0c@xmath1)@xmath2 with x@xmath110.10 has been achieved in single crystals @xcite and polycrystalline wires fabricated by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of preparing mg(b@xmath0c@xmath1)@xmath2 with x@xmath110.10 using b@xmath3c as the carbon source .",
    "powder samples of mg(b@xmath0c@xmath1)@xmath2 were prepared in a two step process .",
    "first , stoichiometric mixtures of distilled mg , elemental b , and the binary compound b@xmath3c were reacted for 48 hours at 1200 @xmath4c .",
    "the resultant sample was then reground in acetone , pressed into a pellet , and re - sintered for an additional 48 hours at 1200 @xmath4c .",
    "two different batches were made .",
    "the first with 0.995 purity b ( metals basis ) from alpha aesar , and the second with 0.9997 purity isotopically enriched @xmath12b from eagle picher .",
    "the three main impurities in the 0.995 purity b are c , si , and fe , which have relative atomic abundances of 0.25% and 0.20% , and 0.10% respectively .",
    "the isotopically enriched @xmath12b contained 0.02% ta , 0.001% cu , and 0.001% fe .",
    "samples made with isotopically enriched @xmath12b were shown to have a higher residual resistivity ratio ( rrr ) than samples made with nominal 0.9999 purity b , indicating the isotopic enrichment process yields perhaps the purest boron available @xcite .",
    "b@xmath3c from alpha aesar was used as the carbon source in both runs .",
    "the b@xmath3c had a nominal purity of 0.994 metals basis with the two primary impurities being si and fe , which occur in relative abundances of 0.37% and 0.074% respectively , values similar to those in the 0.995 purity b. since impurities in the boron have been shown to suppress t@xmath6 @xcite , two differing boron purities were used to examine the effects of the starting boron purity on the t@xmath6 and h@xmath7(t=0 ) values in carbon doped mgb@xmath2 .",
    "we found it necessary to use multiple reaction steps to incorporate the carbon as uniformly as possible . to avoid confusion regarding the meaning of x in mg(b@xmath0c@xmath1)@xmath2",
    ", we will henceforth refer to the nominal carbon content as x@xmath13 and the inferred carbon content after the m - th reaction step as x@xmath14 .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements were made at room temperature using cuk@xmath15 radiation in a rigaku miniflex diffractometer .",
    "a silicon standard was used to calibrate each pattern .",
    "lattice parameters were determined from the position of the mgb@xmath2 ( 002 ) and ( 110 ) peaks .",
    "dc magnetization measurements were performed in a quantum design mpms-5 squid magnetometer .",
    "transport measurements were done using a four probe technique , with platinum wires attached to the samples with epotek h20e silver epoxy .",
    "resistance versus temperature in applied fields up to 14 t were carried out in a quantum design ppms-14 system and resistance versus field was measured up to 32.5 t using a lock - in amplifier technique in a resistive dc magnet at the national high magnetic field laboratory in tallahassee , florida .",
    "using the lower purity boron , we reacted a sample with nominal carbon content of x@xmath13=0.05 for 48 hours at 1200 @xmath4c .",
    "the carbon content can be estimated by the shift of the x - ray ( 110 ) peak position relative to that of a nominally pure mgb@xmath2 sample made under the same conditions @xcite . although the b@xmath3c is a different b source than that used for the reference sample , the 0.994 purity b@xmath3c and 0.995 purity b contain similar concentrations of impurity phases , and we cautiously proceed with estimates of the carbon content ignoring minor differences between boron sources .",
    "indexing of the ( 110 ) peak for the pure sample and that containing a nominal carbon content of x@xmath13=0.05 yielded an inferred carbon level after this first reaction step of approximately x@xmath16=0.031 . in order to ensure the carbon was fully incorporated and uniformly distributed within this sample ,",
    "it was reground in acetone , pressed into a pellet , and sintered for an addition 48 hours at 1200 @xmath4c .",
    "the subsequent sample showed a further increase in the ( 110 ) peak position ( figure 1 ) which yielded an inferred carbon content of x@xmath17=0.069 .",
    "this sample also showed decrease in t@xmath6 ( figure 2 ) , which is consistent with more carbon being incorporated in the structure .",
    "in addition to shifting to higher 2@xmath18 , the ( 110 ) peak became sharper .",
    "the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) decreased from 0.221@xmath4 to 0.157@xmath4 after the second sintering step .",
    "therefore the second sintering step not only incorporated more carbon but it appears to have resulted in a more uniform carbon distribution .",
    "it should be noted that after the two sintering steps the fwhm values of the mgb@xmath2 peaks were comparable to those of the si standard , indicating we have achieved a fairly high level of homogeneity .",
    "it is also worth noting that whereas the ( 110 ) peak shifts and sharpens as a result of a second reaction step , the ( 002 ) peak does neither , having fwhm values comparable to , but slightly larger than , the neighboring si ( 311 ) peak after both reaction steps .",
    "this indicates that the c - axis spacing and periodicity are particularly insensitive to this degree of carbon doping and/or disorder .",
    "whereas the x@xmath17 value exceeds the nominal value of x@xmath13=0.05 in the starting material , the presence of mgb@xmath3 , as evidenced by strong peaks in the x - ray spectrum ( figure 3 ) may account for the discrepancy if we assume no carbon enters the mgb@xmath3 structure .",
    "comparison of the x - ray spectra for the single and two step reactions shows an increase in the intensity of the mgb@xmath3 peaks after the second reaction step .",
    "this step was done without the addition of any extra mg to compensate for potential mg loss .",
    "it is possible that while sintering at 1200 @xmath4c , some mg is driven out of the mgb@xmath2 structure and this loss results in conversion of mgb@xmath2 to mgb@xmath3 , with the excess mg forming mgo and possibly condensing on the walls of the tantalum reaction vessel during the quench . to determine whether or not mg loss is responsible for the apparent increase in the carbon content , the second sintering step for a sample with nominal concentration x@xmath13=0.05 was carried out in an atmosphere of excess mg vapor",
    "this sample exhibited a t@xmath6 of 29.8 k and a shift in the ( 110 ) x - ray peak yielding an inferred carbon concentration of x@xmath17=0.050 ( figure 4 ) , consistent with the nominal concentration .",
    "thus the apparent difference in carbon content for samples which undergo a second sintering step without the presence of excess mg to compensate for mg loss relative to those which undergo the second sintering step with excess mg is presumably the result of a fixed amount of carbon being incorporated into a decreased amount of mgb@xmath2 . to avoid the potential creation of percolation networks of mg within the samples we chose to perform the second sintering step without any additional mg",
    ".    using 0.995 purity boron and 0.994 purity b@xmath3c , an entire series with nominal carbon levels of x@xmath13=0 , 0.0125 , 0.025 , 0.035 , 0.05 , and 0.075 was prepared using the two step reaction profile . the ( 002 ) and ( 110 ) x - ray peak positions for the entire series are plotted in figure 5 .",
    "the ( 002 ) peak position is roughly constant for all carbon levels , consistent with the results found by wilke et al . @xcite and avdeev et al .",
    "@xcite , which showed only a slight expansion along the c - axis for carbon doping levels up to 10@xmath192% .",
    "the ( 110 ) peak position shifts towards higher 2@xmath18 values as x is increased up to x@xmath13=0.05 , at which point it appears to be saturated . using the ( 110 ) peak position for the nominally pure sample as our standard , the inferred carbon concentrations for the entire series are x@xmath17=0 , 0.01 , 0.034 , 0.044 , 0.069 , and 0.067 .",
    "the samples with carbon concentrations saturating near x@xmath17@xmath50.07 show an increase in the mgb@xmath2c@xmath2 phase as a function of the nominal carbon content ( figure 5b ) .",
    "thus the excess carbon is precipitating out as mgb@xmath2c@xmath2 .",
    "normalized magnetization measurements ( figure 6 ) confirm the highest two doping levels have incorporated roughly the same amount of carbon .",
    "their transition temperatures all lie slightly below 28 k. defining t@xmath6 using a 2% screening criteria the x@xmath17=0.069 and 0.067 levels have t@xmath6 values of 27.5 k and 27.8 k respectively . for these higher doping levels ,",
    "the nominal concentrations did not yield systematic increases in carbon level , but the change in the a - lattice parameter and t@xmath6 are consistent with one another ; i.e. samples which apparently incorporated more carbon had smaller a - lattice parameters and lower t@xmath6 values .",
    "this saturation near x@xmath17@xmath50.07 is not entirely unexpected given the results of 10@xmath192% carbon incorporation using b@xmath3c reported by ribeiro et al .",
    "@xcite and avdeev et al .",
    "@xcite . in optimizing the reaction",
    ", ribeiro found that under certain conditions , t@xmath6 values below the near 22 k reported for the optimal 24 hours at 1100 @xmath4c reaction could be attained , suggesting higher carbon content phases may be metastable . to test whether the saturation we observed was an effect due to the use of a two step reaction , as opposed to the single step employed by ribeiro et al . , we repeated their work , making a sample of nominal concentration mg(b@xmath20c@xmath21)@xmath2 using only mg plus b@xmath3c .",
    "this sample underwent an initial 48 hour reaction at 1200 @xmath4c to form the superconducting phase and a second sintering for 48 hours at 1200 @xmath4c .",
    "after the first 48 hours at 1200 @xmath4c we find a superconducting phase with t@xmath6 near 22 k , and a lattice parameter shift which yielded inferred values of x@xmath16=0.092 slightly less than the x@xmath22=0.10 obtained by ribeiro and coworkers using isotopically enriched @xmath12b@xmath3c as the carbon source @xcite . after the second sintering step",
    ", t@xmath6 rises to 27.9 k. the ( 110 ) x - ray peaks shifted to lower 2@xmath18 , yielding an inferred x@xmath17=0.065 ( figure 7 ) . although two reaction steps were used , no change in the fwhm of the ( 110 ) peak was observed . as in the case of the x@xmath13=0.075 sample ,",
    "the decrease in carbon content could be due to carbon precipitating out in the form of mgb@xmath2c@xmath2 .",
    "the relative intensity of the most prominent mgb@xmath2c@xmath2 peak to that of mgb@xmath2 approximately doubles going from the single step reaction to the two step reaction . in order to check if more carbon would be precipitated out in the form of mgb@xmath2c@xmath2 by simply adding more sintering steps to the growth process an additional sample underwent a three step reaction : an initial 48 hours at 1200 @xmath4c to form the superconducting phase followed by two additional sintering steps of 48 hours at 1200 @xmath4c .",
    "after this third reaction step , the sample exhibited a t@xmath6 of 27.9 k and the ( 110 ) peak position yielded an inferred carbon content of x@xmath23=0.064 ( figure 7 ) .",
    "these values are comparable to our previous results with only two sintering steps .",
    "thus the carbon content appears to saturate in the vicinity of an inferred carbon content of x@xmath22=0.065 .",
    "the fact that saturation near x@xmath17=0.065 occurred for samples which had x@xmath16 both above and below this level indicates that in equilibrium the solubility limit for 1200 @xmath4c reactions near 1 atm is in the range 0.065@xmath11 x@xmath22 @xmath11 0.07 .",
    "transport measurements were made in order to determine the upper critical field .",
    "an onset criteria was used in both resistance versus temperature and resistance versus field .",
    "figure 8a plots resistance versus temperature in applied fields up to 14 t and figure 8b plots resistance versus field at temperatures down to 1.4 k for the sample with a carbon level of x@xmath17=0.069 ( x@xmath13=0.05 ) .",
    "the zero field resistive transition has a width of less than 1 k , but this significantly broadens as the strength of the applied field increases .",
    "the r vs. h measurements show a related broadening .",
    "for example , the width of the transition at 1.4 k is nearly 20 t wide .",
    "this should be compared to the 10 t wide , approximately linear transitions reported for 5.2% carbon doped filaments @xcite .",
    "optical images taken under polarized light show the superconducting grains in the powder sample are 5 - 10 @xmath24 m in size . in the case of the wire sample a majority of the grains",
    "are in the 1 - 5 @xmath24 m range @xcite .",
    "we therefore ascribe the increased width of this transition to a combination of poor flux pinning due to the large grain size associated with the high reaction temperature as well as to possible remaining inhomogeneities in carbon incorporation within the sample .",
    "h@xmath7 curves for x@xmath17=0.034 and x@xmath17=0.069 along with a pure wire @xcite and a carbon doped wire with an inferred carbon content of x@xmath22=0.052 @xcite are plotted in figure 9 .",
    "the powder sample with x@xmath17=0.034 has a t@xmath6 slightly less than that of the carbon doped wire with x@xmath22=0.052 and an h@xmath7(t=0 ) more than 5 t lower .",
    "this marked difference shows that for carbon doped samples made with differing nominal boron purities , t@xmath6 alone is not a good caliper of h@xmath7(t=0 ) .",
    "the sample with inferred carbon content of x@xmath17=0.069 has a t@xmath6 nearly 7 k below the aforementioned wire and an h@xmath7(t=0 ) just above 30 t. comparing the two powder samples to one another , we see an increase in the slope of h@xmath7 near t@xmath6 for the higher doping level , which results in a higher h@xmath7(t=0 ) , consistent with our earlier findings @xcite .",
    "carbon has been shown to suppress t@xmath6 at a rate of roughly 1 k/%c for up to 5% carbon substitution @xcite .",
    "the magnetization and transport measurements indicate t@xmath6 of the powder samples made with the 0.995 purity alpha aesar boron is also being suppressed at a rate of roughly 1 k/%c , but relative to the suppressed , near 37 k , transition temperature of the nominally pure sample .",
    "the suppressed transition temperature of the nominally pure mgb@xmath2 sample lies approximately 2 k below results obtained using high purity natural boron wires @xcite .",
    "mgb@xmath2 made from lower purity boron has been shown to have lower transition temperatures @xcite . in figure 10 ,",
    "a comparison of t@xmath6 versus @xmath25@xmath26a@xmath25 for carbon doped samples prepared with lower purity boron to carbon doped wires made with high purity boron shows the manifold associated with the impure boron powder is shifted downward by approximately 2 k for all carbon levels . to confirm that this difference is a result of the purity of the starting boron ,",
    "a second set of two step process samples made with isotopically enriched @xmath12b were measured .",
    "the results are included in figure 10 .",
    "also included is a set of carbon doped powders made by a plasma spray process @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the cvd wires , plasma spray powders , and @xmath12b samples shows that high purity boron in a variety of forms responds to carbon doping in a similar manner .",
    "these data also seem to indicate that there is some additional impurity in the 0.995 pure alpha aesar boron that is systematically suppressing t@xmath6 .",
    "figure 11 plots a comparison of the ( 002 ) and ( 110 ) x - ray peaks of pure mgb@xmath2 using the three different purity levels of boron .",
    "the sample made with the nominal 0.995 purity boron shows a shift of the ( 110 ) peak to higher 2@xmath18 by 0.09@xmath4 , which , if it were to be associated with carbon doping , would be consistent with carbon doping of approximately 1.8% .",
    "this level far exceeds the stated carbon impurity level of 0.25% in the 0.995 purity b as claimed in the certificate of analysis provided by alpha aesar . to check whether by using lower purity boron we have inadvertently doped with carbon to such a high level , we measured the resistive onset of superconductivity in an externally applied 14 t field for the nominal pure mgb@xmath2 using the 0.995 purity boron and compared the temperature with those attained for carbon doped fibers reported in reference @xcite .",
    "mgb@xmath2 fibers reacted at 1200 @xmath4c for 48 hours showed an onset of superconductivity in an externally applied magnetic field of 14 t at 10.2 k , 14.8 k , and 18.5 k for pure , 0.6% , and 2.1% carbon doping @xcite .",
    "if the shift of the ( 110 ) peak in the nominally pure mgb@xmath2 made from 0.995 purity boron were a result of inadvertent carbon doping , we would expect an onset of superconductivity in an applied 14 t field at a temperature between 15 k and 18 k. however , such a measurement yielded an onset near 13k indicating if carbon is present as an impurity , it is less than 0.6% , which consistent with the estimate provided by alpha aesar .",
    "therefore the manifold of t@xmath6 versus @xmath25@xmath26a@xmath25 for the lower purity boron is shifted downward by some as of yet unidentified impurity associated with the alpha aesar boron .",
    "h@xmath7 values were determined using an onset criteria in resistivity versus temperature and resistance versus field measurements .",
    "pellets made using the isotopically enriched @xmath12b lacked structural integrity and were unsuitable for transport measurements",
    ". therefore we could only attain h@xmath7(t=0 ) values only for samples made from the cvd wires , plasma spray powders , and the 0.995 purity boron ( figure 12 ) .",
    "for the dirtier , 0.995 purity powder , at a doping level of x@xmath17=0.034 the upper critical field agrees with the results of a carbon doped wire with an inferred carbon content of x@xmath22=0.038 from reference @xcite .",
    "at doping levels near x@xmath17=0.065 , h@xmath7",
    "values fall several tesla below the manifold for `` clean '' carbon doped samples . in carbon doped mgb@xmath2 , enhancement of h@xmath7 due to scattering effects",
    "@xcite competes with the suppression of t@xmath6 caused by electron doping @xcite . by further suppressing t@xmath6 by introducing additional impurities in the system ,",
    "we may have limited the maximum h@xmath7 attainable through carbon doping .",
    "we have established a method for synthesizing mg(b@xmath0c@xmath1)@xmath2 using a mixture of distilled magnesium , boron and the binary compound b@xmath3c .",

    "t@xmath6 we were able to show that different boron purities lead to differing t@xmath6(@xmath25@xmath26a@xmath25 ) manifolds .",
    "there appears to be a solubility limit in the carbon content for samples synthesized at 1200 @xmath4c and 1 atm near x@xmath50.07 .",
