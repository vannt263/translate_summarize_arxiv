    "strongly correlated electron systems with orbital degrees of freedom are attracting much interest in condensed matter physics .",
    "a particularly active topic is the study of superconducting ( sc ) states in transition metal oxides such as @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite , and fullerene - based solids @xmath4 ( a = alkali metal )  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have been investigated theoretically by taking into account coulomb interactions , hund coupling , the multiband structure , and the lattice geometry .",
    "electron correlations have been treated by means of various analytical and numerical methods such as the random phase approximation , fluctuation - exchange approximation , and dynamical cluster approximation .",
    "while the relevant diagrams should be included in the method , it may be difficult to identify which ones are crucial for stabilizing the sc state .",
    "a simple question which naturally arises is whether or not a sc state can be realized in a model with repulsive interactions , without any particular properties of the band structure .",
    "since the onsite coulomb repulsion usually prevents the formation of tightly coupled singlet pairs , it is expected that an unconventional superconducting state with an anisotropic gap should be realized instead of the @xmath0-wave superconducting state .",
    "this simple argument should be valid in the single band case .    in multiorbital systems ,",
    "on the other hand , the situation may be more complicated .",
    "et al . _ have studied the two - band hubbard model with intraorbital interaction @xmath5 , interorbital interaction @xmath6 and hund coupling @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "they showed that a strongly correlated sc ground state appears under certain conditions when @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , in this analysis , the role of the hund coupling is not quite clear since it is naively expected that the interorbital exchange interaction suppresses intraorbital pairing correlations .",
    "therefore , it is instructive to clarify which interactions stabilize the superconducting state in the two - orbital system .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to explore whether or not the sc state in the strongly correlated region is adiabatically connected to the trivial bcs - type sc state stabilized by weak attractive interactions .",
    "this may give us a simple explanation for the stability of the sc state in the repulsively interacting system .",
    "to clarify these issues , we consider the two - orbital hubbard model . by combined use of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite and the continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc )",
    "method  @xcite , we show that if orbital and magnetic ordering is suppressed , an @xmath0-wave sc state is realized in the model with degenerate orbitals at half filling , and that it is adiabatically connected to the simple bcs - type sc state .",
    "the effect of the crystalline electric field is also addressed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ 2 ] , we introduce the two - band hubbard model and briefly summarize our theoretical approach . in sec . [ 3 ] , we demonstrate the existence of a sc state in the repulsively interacting region of parameter space .",
    "we study the stability of the @xmath0-wave sc state at low temperatures in sec .",
    "a brief summary is given in the last section .",
    "we consider a correlated electron system with two orbitals , which is described by the hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the summation over the nearest neighbor sites , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is an annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath14 and orbital index @xmath15 at the @xmath16th site , and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the transfer integral , @xmath19 is the crystal field splitting , @xmath5 @xmath20 is the intraband ( interband ) coulomb interaction , and @xmath7 is the hund coupling . here",
    ", we neglect translational symmetry breaking phases such as density waves , antiferromagnetically ordered or antiferro - orbital ordered states .",
    "this para - magnetic / orbital solution should be essentially the same as that for the hamiltonian with next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath21 equal to the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "first , we do not impose any relations between the interactions , such as @xmath23 .",
    "this allows us to discuss how the sc state which is realized in the single band attractive hubbard model ( @xmath24 ) is adiabatically connected to the strongly correlated sc state in model ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we can discuss how the hund coupling affects the sc state .",
    "we briefly address the sc state under the condition @xmath23 at the end .",
    "to investigate the stability of the @xmath0-wave sc state , we use dmft  @xcite . in dmft ,",
    "the original lattice model is mapped to an effective impurity model , which allows to take into account dynamical correlations .",
    "the lattice green s function is obtained via a self - consistency condition imposed on the impurity problem .",
    "the dmft treatment allows us to discuss the stability of the @xmath0-wave sc state more quantitatively than the static bcs mean - field theory  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dmft method has been successfully applied to various strongly correlated fermion systems with sc and superfluid states  @xcite .",
    "when the sc state is treated in the framework of dmft , the green s function should be described in the nambu formalism . when the cooper pairs are formed only in the same orbital , the impurity green s function can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the normal green s function for an electron with spin @xmath27 and orbital @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the anomalous green s functions . in the calculations , we use a semi - circular density of states , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the half - bandwidth .",
