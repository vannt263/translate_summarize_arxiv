    "<S> [ sscor ] , we find that @xmath65 for @xmath35 is shorter than that for @xmath37 where @xmath65 diverges in the thermodynamic limit , but is longer than that for @xmath33 where the spin correlation decays algebraically . </S>",
    "<S> the rather long range spin correlation in phase ii should be contrasted with the exponential decay of spin correlation expected in gapped qsl . </S>",
    "<S> recalling also the result of the response to the pinning magnetic field , the ground state in phase ii resembles gapless qsl . </S>",
    "<S> we should note however that the spin structure factor displays no fermi surface singularity  @xcite and thus the ground state in phase ii is neither compatible with spinon fermi sea  @xcite nor with spin bose metal  @xcite .     between a reference site @xmath20 at the center of the cluster ( indicated by a red circle ) and other sites for ( a ) @xmath33 , ( b ) @xmath35 , and ( c ) @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> it is clearly seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nnspin](d ) that @xmath75 for @xmath37 is rather enhanced at @xmath76 and suppressed at @xmath77 for @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , the oscillations in @xmath75 for @xmath35 are smallest , especially around the center of the cluster . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , we calculate the hopping amplitude between nearest - neighbor sites , exhibiting the similar oscillation pattern , which also implies the absence of spatial symmetry breakings such as bond order . these results further support phase ii being a qsl .     for ( a ) @xmath33 , ( b ) @xmath35 , and ( c ) @xmath37 . here </S>",

    "<S> let us now compare the nature of the ground state in phase ii with the @xmath81 spin liquid ground state of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the triangular lattice with the next nearest - neighbor exchange interaction , recently reported in refs .  . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster used here ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ model ] ) is an odd cylinder  @xcite with odd number of sites in the one dimensional unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , according to the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem  @xcite , the ground state for this cluster is degenerate if the excitation gap is finite as in the case for the @xmath81 spin liquid . reflecting this degeneracy </S>",
    "<S> , the spatial distribution of the nearest - neighbor spin correlation @xmath82 exhibits the strong alternating oscillation , induced by open boundary conditions along @xmath28-direction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the similar oscillation pattern is found in phase iii and around the edge of the cluster in phase ii , the central region of the cluster in phase ii does not show such feature ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nnspin ] ) . since the cluster used here is much smaller than those in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> , the more detail analysis using larger clusters is highly desirable in order to determine the nature of the ground state in phase ii and , in particular , to address experimental observation of gapless qsl in etme@xmath11sb[pd(dmit)@xmath10]@xmath10  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated the chiral correlation function and found that the chiral spin liquid  @xcite is unlikely in phase ii  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we emphasize a rather small discontinuity @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) in the double occupancy found at the metal - insulator transition @xmath25 , which is in sharp contrast to the previous studies using other approaches , where @xmath83 is typically much larger ( from 0.02 to 0.06 ) , and is even qualitatively different from the continuous transition discussed in refs .   and . </S>",
    "<S> smallness of the jump might be the origin of the controversy about the order of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that the discontinuity @xmath83 corresponds to the interaction ( or equivalently kinetic ) energy jump of @xmath85 , giving @xmath86 k for the organic materials with @xmath87 mev  @xcite , which nicely compares with the temperature where the first order transition line ends in the phase diagram of the organic materials  @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed large scale 2d - drmg calculations , using up to @xmath31 density - matrix eigenstates , to examine the ground state phase diagram of the hubbard model on the triangular lattice at half filling . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the convergence of our results is well controlled and , therefore , our results can be regarded as the most accurate and unbiased results available at a moment , apart from the small cluster shape and size dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we have found two first order transitions separating the three different phases , which include a gapless qsl like phase in the intermediate region . </S>",
    "<S> further properties of this phase , such as the nature of its excitations , remain to be firmly examined since that would greatly improve our understanding of spin liquids in general as well as of the organic materials in particular .    </S>",
