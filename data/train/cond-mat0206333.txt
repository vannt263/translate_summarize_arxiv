    "one way to overcome this problem is by multicanonical ( muca ) simulations , which calculate canonical expectation values over a temperature range in a single simulation by using the weight factor  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of states with energy @xmath8 and @xmath9 the microcanonical entropy . in an extension of the microcanonical terminology on",

    "similar simulation concepts can actually be traced back to the work by torrie and valleau  @xcite in the 1970s . in recent years",

    "our definition([o ] ) of @xmath32 agrees with the one commonly used for the ising model  @xcite , but disagrees by a factor of two with the one used for the potts model in  @xcite : @xmath33 for the @xmath14 potts models a number of exact results are known in the infinite volume limit .",

    "we run the recursion in the range @xmath56 these values of namin and namax are chosen to cover the entire range of temperatures , from the completely disordered ( @xmath57 ) region to the groundstate ( @xmath58 ) . in many applications",
    "the actual range of physical interest is smaller , namin and namax should correspondingly be adjusted , because the recursion time increases quickly with the range .",
    "the recursion is completed after maxtun tunneling events have been performed .",
    "tunneling event _ is defined as an updating process which finds its way from @xmath59 this notation comes from the applications of the method to first order phase transitions  @xcite , for which namin and namax are separated by a free energy barrier in the canonical ensemble .",
    "although the muca method removes this barrier , the terminus tunneling was kept .",
    "the requirement that the process tunnels also back is included in the definition , because a one way tunneling is not indicative for the convergence of the recursion .",
    "most important , the process has still to tunnel when the weights are frozen for the second stage of the simulations note that things work differently for the wang - landau recursion  @xcite .",
    "it has no problems to tunnel in its initial stage , but its estimates of the spectral density are still bad , such that the tunneling process gets stuck as soon as the weights are fixed .",
    "for most applications ten tunnelings during our recursion part lead to acceptable weights .",
    "if the requested number of tunnelings is not reached after a certain maximum number of recursion steps , the problem will disappear in most cases by rerunning ( eventually several times ) with different random numbers .",
    "otherwise , the number of sweeps between recursions should be enlarged , because our recursion is strictly only valid when the system is in equilibrium .",
    "one may even consider to discard some sweeps after each recursion step to reach equilibrium , but empirical evidence indicates that the improvement ( if any ) does not warrant the additional cpu time .",
    "the disturbance of the equilibrium is weak when the weight function approaches its fixed point . in the default setting of our programs",
    "we take the number of sweeps between recursion steps inversely proportional to the acceptance rate , because equal number of accepted moves is a better relaxation criterion than an equal number of sweeps .    in the subdirectory e2_01 of exercises a @xmath60 lattice ising model simulation",
    "is prepared for which we requested ten tunneling events .",
    "we we find them after 787 recursions and 64,138 sweeps , corresponding to an average acceptance rate of 20 * 787/64138=0.245 ( the acceptance rate can be calculated this way , because the number of accepted sweeps triggers the recursion ) .",
    "almost half of the sweeps are spent to achieve the first tunneling event .",
    "subsequently , an muca production run of 10,000 equilibrium and @xmath61 sweeps with measurements is carried out . on a ghz linux",
    "pc the entire runtime ( recursion plus production ) is about thirty seconds . in the subdirectory",
    "e2_02 a similar simulation is prepared for the @xmath14 10-state potts model on a @xmath55 lattice .",
    "let us assume that we have performed a muca simulation which covers the action histogram needed for a temperature range @xmath62 in practice this means that the parameters namax and namin in muca.par have to be chosen such that @xmath63 holds , where @xmath64 is the canonical expectation value of the action variable  ( [ iact ] ) .",
    "the @xmath65 conditions may be relaxed to equal signs , if @xmath66 is used for all action values @xmath67 and @xmath68 for all action values @xmath69 .",
    "given the muca time series , where @xmath70 labels the generated configurations , the definition  ( [ o ] ) of the canonical expectation values leads to the muca estimator @xmath71 @xmath72 \\over \\sum_{i=1}^n \\exp   \\left [ -\\beta\\,e^{(i ) } + b(e^{(i)})\\,e^{(i)}-a(e^{(i ) } ) \\right ] } .\\ ] ] this formula replaces the muca weighting of the simulation by the boltzmann factor of equation  ( [ o ] ) .",
    "the denominator differs from @xmath73 by a constant factor , which drops out because the numerator differs by the same constant factor from the numerator of  ( [ o ] ) .",
    "if only functions of the energy ( in our computer programs the action variable ) are calculated , it is sufficient to keep histograms instead of the entire time series . for an operator @xmath74 equation  ( [ o_muca ] ) simplifies then to @xmath75 @xmath76 \\over \\sum_e h_{mu}(e)\\ ,   \\exp \\left [ -\\beta\\,e + b(e)\\,e - a(e ) \\right ] } .\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the histogram sampled during the muca production run and the sums are over all energy values for which @xmath77 has entries . when calculating error bars for estimates from equations  ( [ o_muca ] ) or  ( [ f_muca ] ) , we employ jackknife  @xcite estimators to reduce bias problems .",
    "a computer implementation of equations  ( [ o_muca ] ) and  ( [ f_muca ] ) requires care .",
    "the differences between the largest and the smallest numbers encountered in the exponents can be really large . to give one example , for the ising model on a @xmath78 lattice and @xmath79 the groundstate configuration contributes @xmath80 , whereas for a disordered configuration @xmath81 is possible . clearly , overflow disasters will result , if we ask fortran to calculate numbers like @xmath82 . when the large terms in the numerator and denominator take on similar orders of magnitude , one can avoid them by subtracting a sufficiently large number in all exponents of the numerator as well as the denominator , resulting in a common factor which divides out . instead of overflows one encounters harmless underflows of the type @xmath83 .",
    "we implement the idea in a more general fashion , which remains valid when the magnitudes of the numerator and the denominator disagree .",
    "we avoid altogether to calculate large numbers and deal only with the logarithms of sums and partial sums .",
    "we first consider sums of positive numbers and discuss the straightforward generalization to arbitrary signs afterwards . for @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 we calculate @xmath87 from the values @xmath88 and @xmath89 , without ever storing either @xmath90 or @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",

    "the argument of the exponential function is negative , such that an underflow occurs when the difference between @xmath94 and @xmath95 becomes too big , whereas it becomes calculable when this difference is small enough .",
