    "despite much progress in recent years , many aspects of structural glasses and undercooled liquids still escape a complete understanding@xcite .",
    "rather than studying the behavior of molecular glasses , one often investigates the behavior of simple models in the hope to capture the basic physics of such systems .",
    "the so - called east model is one of these simple models@xcite .",
    "it is a classic ising model with a trivial hamiltonian in which the stochastic dynamics governing the change of spin leads to a complicated and highly - cooperative evolution of the system . in the east model , any spin has finite probability to flip from up to down or vice - versa only if the spin to the east of it ( i.e. , of higher lattice index ) is up .",
    "models of this kind are generally called kinetically constrained models or facilitating spin models@xcite .",
    "such models are designed to mimic@xcite the kind of dynamics that take place in glasses@xcite . although the east model itself does not have a glass transition at any finite spin density@xcite , the decay of the single spin time - correlation function at low densities is a stretched exponential@xcite , following a functional form similar to that of the dynamic structure factor in glassy systems@xcite .",
    "in fact , the typical spin relaxation time has been shown to behave as @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is the equilibrium density of up - spins , heuristically by sollich and evans@xcite and rigorously by aldous and diaconis@xcite , indicating an extreme slowing down for small @xmath2 , suggestive of a transition at @xmath4 .",
    "more recently , the east model has been analyzed to examine the nature of dynamic heterogeneities@xcite in frustrated systems .",
    "the typical relaxation times present in systems exhibiting frustration can be retrieved from time correlation functions . in glasses ,",
    "mode coupling theory is one of the predominant descriptions for these correlation functions .",
    "several approaches to mode coupling theories exist . in the context of glasses , that of gtze and co - workers has been widely used@xcite .    the approach of gtze and co - workers expresses the time correlation functions in terms of a memory kernel and then uses a certain ansatz in which the memory function is written in terms of the correlation functions themselves , yielding self - consistent equations .",
    "oppenheim and co - workers have addressed the formal points and justification of mode coupling theories in fourier space@xcite . along similar lines , andersen@xcite has formulated a phase - space mode coupling theory for general fluids that leads to self - consistent equations for time dependent correlation functions .    mode coupling theory can be applied for both deterministic and stochastic systems . for some systems , such as the east model , the application of the most commonly used mode - coupling ansatz necessary to close the resulting equation of motion for the spin autocorrelation function leads to a spurious transition from an ergodic to non - ergodic phase at finite values of the spin concentration @xmath2 , a result that is clearly at odds with simulation results . to analyze the failure of the closure approximation in mode coupling theory , pitts _ et al . _",
    "have presented a diagrammatic treatment that yields similar equations to those of mode coupling theories of the glass transition@xcite .",
    "this treatment lends itself to a closure assumption that is very similar kind to the mode coupling theory of gtze _",
    "et al_. pitts _ et al .",
    "_ propose alternative closure assumptions to this mode coupling theory by summing subsets of diagrams .",
    "the resulting predictions are in good agreement with simulations for high concentration of up - spins , but still decay too rapidly at lower spin density .",
    "recent improvements on this scheme have been carried out by wu and cao@xcite based on a combination of matrix methods and mode coupling closure assumptions .",
    "regardless of the precise formalism , mode coupling theories aim to describe slow long time behavior , and so should include all the `` slow modes '' of the system . for hydrodynamics of a simple fluid at moderate densities ,",
    "these slow modes are well - known , namely the density , momentum and energy modes at large wave lengths .",
    "correspondingly , when applied to fourier modes of these hydrodynamical fields , mode coupling theory ( e.g. in the formulation of oppenheim and co - workers ) yields well defined perturbative results when the correlation length is finite and the thermodynamic limit is taken .",
    "however , in the case of the east model , the relevant slow modes are less obvious , and previously developed mode coupling theories for this model@xcite may have missed some of these slow modes .",
    "in fact the absence of some slow modes provides a possible explanation for the problem these theories have with describing the long time behavior at small @xmath2 .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to identify the relevant slow modes in frustrated spin systems and to describe the impact of the coupling of these modes to a specific spin variable .",
    "it is demonstrated that the existence of slowly - relaxing spin domains of arbitrary size suggests a natural basis of slow modes in which quantitatively accurate but simple approximation schemes are easily formulated for many quantities of interest in the study of slow heterogeneous relaxation .",
    "the east model@xcite is a linear chain of @xmath5 spins , which are numbered from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , with each spin allowed to assume one of two values at any given time , here taken to be up or down .",
    "occupation numbers @xmath8 are defined such that @xmath9 when spin @xmath10 is up and @xmath6 if it is down .",

    "only real quantities will be used in this paper , so there is no need to define a complex inner product ( although this is straightforward ) .",
    "the time correlation function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 can now be written as @xmath46 . when @xmath47 , _ i.e. _ , when detailed balance holds , as it does in this model , @xmath31 is hermitian with respect to the inner product .",
    "in contrast to stochastic systems , in deterministic systems the liouville operator is anti - hermitian .",
    "it should be noted that the condition of detailed balance also guarantees that the limiting stationary distribution of the markovian dynamics is the equilibrium distribution  , provided the underlying markov process is ergodic@xcite .    as remarked by pitts et al.@xcite , different sites are not only _ statically _ independent [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] , but also _",
    "dynamically_. to see this , consider the normalized single site fluctuation @xmath48 which satisfies @xmath49  @xmath50  @xmath51 and @xmath52 . note that @xmath53 using eqs .   and .",
    "thus , the time derivative of @xmath54 depends on the product of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the derivative of that product will in turn depend on @xmath56 , and so on .",
    "thus , @xmath57 involves only @xmath54 with @xmath58 . from the static independence of any site @xmath10 and any other site @xmath59 with @xmath60",
    ", it follows that @xmath61 . because @xmath31 is hermitian , also @xmath62 .",
    "so all time correlation functions between different sites @xmath63 are zero .    given the dynamical independence of different sites , we are interested in the nontrivial time correlation function @xmath64 in the limit @xmath65 with @xmath10 fixed , this is independent of @xmath10 due to translation invariance .",
    "this single spin time correlation function in the thermodynamic limit is the main quantity of interest .",
    "in a mode coupling framework , dynamical equations are derived for the time correlation functions of slow modes in the system , which involves a memory kernel that is again expressed in terms of the correlation functions@xcite .",
    "the starting point is often a projection operator formalism . here",
    ", a general setup will be presented , which uses the mori - zwanzig projection operator formalism@xcite , to be specialized later .",
    "let @xmath66 be the slow modes of the system determined from physical arguments , with @xmath67 an index running over the slow modes .",
    "it will be assumed that @xmath68 ( as could be achieved by subtracting the average ) , and that @xmath66 are orthonormal , i.e. , @xmath69 ( as could be achieved by a gramm - schmidt procedure ) . for brevity ,",
    "the @xmath66 s are taken together in a vector @xmath44 . in the projection operator formalism , the component along @xmath44 of any other physical quantity @xmath45 is found using the projection operator @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes a vector product , i.e. , a sum over @xmath67 , as indicated . using the operator identity @xmath72 and eqs .   and , one can derive that @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 note that @xmath76 and @xmath77 are matrices whose dimensions are equal to the number of slow modes and that @xmath76 contains only static information , while the memory kernel @xmath77 involves the time correlation of the fluctuating force @xmath78 .    taking the inner product with @xmath44 , eq .",
    "yields an equation for the correlation function @xmath79 : @xmath80 to solve this equation , a laplace transform will be used , defined as @xmath81 here and the following , we adopt the convention that quantities with a tilde ( @xmath82 ) are @xmath83-dependent .",
    "the solution in laplace space of eq .",
    "is @xmath84 where @xmath85",
    "if @xmath44 in the previous section contained all the slow behavior , then @xmath77 would be a quickly - decaying function that could be replaced by a delta function in time and integrated over in eq .",
    "unfortunately , this is typically not the case because the projection operator @xmath86 only removes part of the dependence on @xmath44 .",
    "for instance in a fluid , the long wave length modes of density , momentum and energy are slow because they correspond to densities of conserved quantities , but only at low densities is it enough to consider only these modes as slow . extending the set @xmath44 by multi - linear modes@xcite , can help , and can be used to setup self - consistent equations which are exact in the thermodynamic limit provided there is a finite dynamical correlation length@xcite .    as is known from the extensive work of gtze and co - workers @xcite in deterministic systems , such self - consistent equations can give rise to a glass transition .    if , on the other hand , @xmath44 is a complete set , then @xmath87 and consequently @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in this case , the above formalism corresponds to writing eq .   in a particular basis",
    "this formulation is often applied to the east model@xcite .",
    "when working with a complete basis set , the set still has to be truncated at some level in practice .",
    "this introduces truncations errors , or , viewed alternatively , a nonzero @xmath77 . to get beyond the truncation problem",
    ", one makes an ansatz for the memory kernel in terms of the time correlation function of interest [ here @xmath90 , yielding a self - consistent equation .",
    "however , in stochastic systems , a glass transition will not be found if such an ansatz is used for the memory kernel , due to the hermitian nature of @xmath91@xcite .",
    "rather , an ansatz needs to be used for the so - called `` irreducible '' memory kernel@xcite .",
    "then , a glass transition can be found for finite @xmath2 in the east model@xcite .",
    "however , simulations make it clear that there is no transition to a non - ergodic phase at a non - zero value of @xmath2 .",
    "somewhat better schemes to improve the ansatz have been developed since@xcite , but generally , they lead either to a transition or to a time correlation function that decays too quickly .",
    "essential for the success of mode coupling theories for fluids at lower densities is the finiteness of the dynamical correlation length , which gives a cutoff length and certain exact factorization properties in the thermodynamic limit@xcite .",
    "however , for the east model , no such length scale exists , as is seen when one contrasts the result of the scaling of the decay time @xcite vs. the diagrammatic approach of pitts and anderson@xcite .",
    "when diagrams are truncated at a certain level , corresponding to taking into account only spins within a certain distance @xmath92 , the memory kernel becomes a polynomial in @xmath2 of which highest power is @xmath93 , which means the typical time can scale at the slowest as @xmath94 .",
    "however , for @xmath95 , the timescale diverges faster than any inverse power of @xmath2@xcite .",
    "so clearly the spins at all positions , arbitrarily far away , need to be taken into account .    a second way to see that the dynamic correlation length is unbounded is to note that while the static correlation length is zero , dynamically , the decay of the time correlation function @xmath96 _ is _ influenced by other spins . for example , if there is a large domain of down spins to the east of a given spin , that particular spin requires a long time to flip since all down spins in the domain must flip at least once .",
    "hence , the decay is correlated with the existence of this domain , and the dynamic correlation length is therefore at least of the order of the size of this domain . but",
    "domains of all sizes exist and larger sized domains will contribute to the behavior of the time correlation function @xmath96 at longer times .",
    "even if one is only interested in the bulk of the behavior of the time correlation function @xmath96 , for which the relevant domains are of typical size @xmath97 , this size diverges as @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , it is no surprise that fixed spatial truncations do not work below a certain value of @xmath2 and that mode coupling theories using such truncations have problems to describe the long time behavior of the time correlation function @xmath96 . for a different formulation of the importance of domains , see garrahan and chandler@xcite and wu and cao@xcite .",
    "thus , physically , the origin of the slowness of the dynamics seems to be related to the absence of a finite dynamical correlation length and the existence of arbitrarily large domains of down spins .",
    "consider the leftmost spin @xmath98 in a semi - infinite chain of spins .",
    "east of this leftmost spin ( i.e. , at sites @xmath99 ) , a domain of typical size @xmath97 filled with down spins exists . in the previous section",
    "it was argued that the presence of these domains is essential to the dynamics , so they should somehow be included .",
    "this is achieved by defining the ( single ) _",
    "domain basis _ , which is composed of the orthonormal basis vectors @xmath100 and    [ 20 ] @xmath101 and in general @xmath102    where the normalization constants are to be chosen such that @xmath103 ^ 2\\rangle}=1 $ ] .",
    "note that in eqs .",
    "each factor @xmath104 only yields a contribution when @xmath105 , _ i.e. _ , when spin @xmath106 is down .",
    "thus , a consecutive sequence of such factors represents a down - spin domain .    comparing the basis vector in eq .",
    "to @xmath107 in eq .  , which is normalized , it is seen that @xmath108 should be equal to @xmath107 , i.e. , @xmath109 using a convenient diagrammatic representation we will later derive that @xmath110 other useful quantities will be the unnormalized versions of these basis vectors @xmath111 note that    [ starstar ] @xmath112    it is convenient at this point to introduce a diagrammatic notation for the unnormalized quantities @xmath113 and @xmath114 , depicted in table  [ diagrame ] . in such diagrams , the horizontal direction represents the lattice .",

    "when these diagrammatic elements are touching , this denotes that they are on neighboring lattice sites .",
    "the first ( i.e. , leftmost ) symbol in a diagram will always refer to site  @xmath6 . note that after a diagram for @xmath113 and @xmath114 has been evaluated , one still has to divide by the appropriate normalization to get the quantities corresponding to @xmath119 and @xmath120 , cf .",

    "however , unlike simple liquid systems , the _ height _ of the plateau is strongly temperature dependent , occurring roughly at value of @xmath2 . in the east model , one can interpret the emergence of the plateau as arising from a kind of effective dynamic caging of the pair spin variable @xmath369 that occurs when @xmath36 .",

    "<S> is motivated by the expectation that slowly - relaxing spin domains of arbitrary size govern the highly cooperative events that lead to spin relaxation at long times . to account for the role of large spin domains in the dynamics , a complete basis expressed in terms of domains of all sizes is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> it is first demonstrated that accounting for single domains of all possible sizes leads to a simple analytical result for the two - time single - spin correlation function in the east model that is in excellent quantitative agreement with simulation data for equilibrium spin up density values @xmath0 . </S>",
