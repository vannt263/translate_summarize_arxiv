    "recent results from the super - kamiokande @xcite and the soudan 2 experiments @xcite have confirmed the existence of the atmospheric neutrino problem @xcite . at the moment",
    ", it seems that neutrino oscillations are the only satisfactory solution of the problem @xcite .",
    "various possibilities of description of the data still exist depending on channel of oscillations .",
    "the @xmath1 oscillations give the most favorable solution @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 channel is restricted by the reactor data @xcite , especially by recent results from chooz experiment @xcite and it seems strongly disfavored by recent super - kamiokande results on the zenith angle dependence of the e - like and @xmath3-like events . at low energies the oscillations to sterile neutrinos , @xmath4 , @xcite lead to results which are similar to those in the @xmath5 channel .",
    "the @xmath4 channel is of interest since it gives an additional freedom in reconciliation of different neutrino anomalies .",
    "moreover , it allows one to keep usual hierarchical mass structure and small mixings for active neutrinos , while solving the atmospheric neutrino problem @xcite . combined effect of different channels of oscillations",
    "is also possible @xcite .    still a number of questions exists concerning the interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "they are related to consistency of the experimental results and to possible systematic errors .",
    "therefore , the crucial task is to find new independent criteria for cross - checking the oscillation hypothesis , as well as for discrimination of different channels of oscillations .",
    "recently several new attempts have been made along with this line @xcite .",
    "up to now studies of the atmospheric neutrinos were restricted , mainly , by events induced by the charged current ( @xmath6 ) interactions ( e - like and @xmath3-like events ) which compose the bulk of the data . however , new high statistics experiments : the super - kamiokande , and later icarus , will allow one to get important information from samples of more rare events .    in this paper we will consider the possibility to use events induced by the _ neutral currents_. the ratio of the neutral and charged currents events ( @xmath7 ) can give an important information on the neutrino flavor oscillations . in the next section we will consider properties of the neutrino fluxes relevant for the @xmath8 and @xmath6 reactions . in experiment one observes events of different type which do not correspond to certain @xmath8 or @xmath6 reactions . in this connection",
    "we identify ( sect .",
    "3 ) the observables which represent closely the ratio @xmath7 and study their sensitivity to different channels of oscillations . in sect .",
    "4 we confront predictions with the available siper - kamiokande data .",
    "in what follows we will consider the ( relative ) fluxes , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 of the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 neutrinos ( and corresponding antineutrinos ) with energies around 1 gev that induce the `` fully contained '' events in the underground detectors .",
    "the neutral current effects are determined by the total flux of the active neutrinos in the detector : @xmath15 for the ratio of this flux and the flux in absence of oscillations , @xmath16 ( the predicted @xmath14-flux is negligibly small ) , we can write @xmath17 \\displaystyle{\\frac{1+r\\ , p}{1 + r } } & \\num \\osc \\nus   \\end{array}~ , \\right . \\label{ncrate}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 ( in the energy range @xmath19 gev ) , and @xmath20 is the @xmath13 survival probability averaged over the appropriate energy range .",
    "the ratio @xmath21 equals one in the no - oscillation case as well as in the case of flavor oscillations .",
    "it is smaller than one , if active neutrinos oscillate into sterile neutrinos , @xmath22    the rates of the charged current events with appearance of the electrons or muons determine @xmath12 or @xmath13 fluxes separately lepton production by the oscillation - induced @xmath14 is strongly suppressed because of the high energy threshold @xmath23=3.4 gev . ]",
    ". the ratios of fluxes with and without oscillations equal : @xmath24",
    "r - ( r- 1)\\ p & \\num \\osc \\nue   \\end{array}~ , \\right . \\label{ncrate1}\\ ] ] and @xmath25 \\displaystyle { r^{-1 } - ( r^{-1 } - 1)\\ p } & \\num \\osc \\nue   \\end{array}~. \\right . \\label{ncrate2}\\ ] ]    to avoid uncertainties related to the absolute normalization of theoretical fluxes",
    "let us introduce the double ratio @xmath26 : @xmath27 that compares the flux of active neutrinos with the flux of electron neutrinos at the detector normalized on the same ratio of fluxes without oscillations",
    ". obviously , @xmath28 in the absence of oscillations .",
    "we can rewrite the double ratio as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the double ratio for the muon and electron neutrino fluxes .",
    "experiment gives the double ratio of the @xmath3-like and the e - like events @xmath31 instead of the expected value 1 which , as is known , composes the atmospheric neutrino problem . from this , up to small corrections due to misidentification of events , we can take @xmath32    the double ratio @xmath26 ( [ rnue0 ] ) allows one to trace the effect of oscillations on the @xmath7 ratios .",
    "notice that once @xmath33 is fixed by experiment , the ratio @xmath26 depends on @xmath34 only . in particular , the minimal value of @xmath26 is attained for @xmath35 the ratio @xmath26 increases with the flux of tau neutrinos in the detector ( if @xmath9 does not change ) . using the definition of the @xmath26 ( [ rnue0 ] ) and assuming @xmath36 we get the inequality @xmath37 in turn , the ratio @xmath38 has at least 20% theoretical uncertainties , and its values smaller than unity ( but compatible with unity ) are experimentally preferred .",
    "this leads to the inequality @xmath39    let us consider the influence of oscillations which give a solution of the atmospheric neutrino problem ( that is , reproduce @xmath40 ) on the double ratio @xmath41 the @xmath1 oscillations imply that @xmath42 and the total flux of active neutrinos is unaffected ; therefore we have @xmath43    in the case of the @xmath2 and @xmath44 oscillation solutions no @xmath14-flux is produced , and according to ( [ rnue1 ] ) we get @xmath45 that is , @xmath26 reaches its minimal value .",
    "let us underline that @xmath2 and @xmath44 oscillations as solutions of the atmospheric problem lead to the same value of ratio @xmath26 , although they modify neutral current effects differently .    in the general case , when both @xmath1 and @xmath44 channels contribute to the deficit of the @xmath13-flux simultaneously , the ratio @xmath26 can take any value in the interval @xmath46 here the right ( left ) value would signal the presence ( absence ) of an induced flux of tau neutrinos ( for sufficiently small @xmath47 the ratio in formula ( [ rnue1 ] ) can be even bigger than one , although this possibility is disfavored experimentally , as discussed above . ) from ( [ range ] ) we conclude that better than 10% accuracy in measurements of @xmath26 is needed to disentangle different solutions at @xmath48 level .    the quantities @xmath33 and @xmath26 are ( double ) ratios of fluxes . in real experimental situations one deals with the numbers of events of certain type",
    "for instance , in the water cherenkov detectors ( the imb , kamiokande and super - kamiokande ) one observes @xmath3-like and e - like events as the sharp and diffuse single - rings respectively . in a calorimetric detector , like soudan , @xmath3-like and e - like",
    "events are identified as tracks and showers _",
    "etc._. moreover , a number of criteria is also implemented to select samples of events , like suitable cuts on the momenta and absence of hits in the cosmic muons veto shield .",
    "therefore , in calculations of numbers of events , the fluxes are folded with cross - sections , efficiencies of detection , misidentification functions _",
    "etc._. as a result the observed events of different type do not correspond to certain underlying reactions .",
    "in particular , both the charged and neutral current reactions can contribute to the same sample of events .",
    "this makes the analysis of the @xmath7 ratio more complicated . in next sections we will identify the samples of events which represent the ratio @xmath7 closely .",
    "notice that in principle , it should be possible for the experimental collaborations to perform the unfolding of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "such a type of analysis was performed by the frjus collaboration @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the possibility to detect the neutral current induced events .",
    "the simplest option would be a study of the elastic scattering of the neutrino : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51e , @xmath52 a recoil proton can be used to track this reaction . in water cherenkov detectors , however , the majority of the recoil protons originated from the interactions of atmospheric neutrinos is below the threshold for cherenkov radiation .",
    "calorimetric detectors do not have this shortcoming , but here the problem is in small statistics .",
    "in fact , only 26 _ proton events _ ( isolated , highly - ionizing short tracks ) , with no coincident hits in the veto shield , had been collected at soudan 2 during 2.83 kton - years of exposure @xcite  % fraction of _ proton events _ with shield hits , as for analysis of the _ track _ and _ shower _ data samples , the neutral current signal reduces to just 10 events approximatively . ] . as follows from the simulations @xcite , the hypothesis that the _ proton events _ are due to neutral current reaction , and",
    "there is no oscillation effect is in agreement with data .",
    "however , small statistics does not allow one to discriminate oscillation scenarios .    at present",
    ", the most promising possibility to track the neutral current effects is to study the reaction with production of one neutral pion : @xmath53 it can be identified as appearance of the isolated @xmath0 without any accompanying signal ( unless the recoil nucleon is visible ) .",
    "the decay @xmath54 gives two electromagnetic cascades which can be detected as two diffuse rings in the water cherenkov detectors or two showers in the calorimeter detectors .",
    "the number ( the rate of production ) of isolated @xmath0 can be compared _",
    "e.g. _ with the number of the e - like ( or @xmath3-like ) events produced by charged currents : @xmath55 that minimizes the theoretical uncertainties in the neutrino fluxes .",
    "here @xmath56 is the predicted ratio .",
    "in ideal situation @xmath57 represents the ratio of the fluxes discussed in previous section , so that @xmath58 in reality one can not exactly identify a sample of events which corresponds to reaction ( [ pi0 ] ) .",
    "let us consider this problem for water cherenkov detectors .",
    "the reaction ( [ pi0 ] ) can be detected as the `` @xmath0-_event _ '' which is determined in the following way :    \\(1 ) two isolated electromagnetic cascades should be detected as two diffuse rings . at high energies",
    "the two rings tend to merge , therefore an upper cut on the total momentum permits to optimize the rings separation .",
    "in particular the super - kamiokande collaboration implements the momentum cut @xmath59 mev .",
    "\\(2 ) the invariant mass of the two identified photons should be in certain interval around the mass of the pion , say , in the interval between @xmath60 and @xmath61 mev .    to study the oscillation effects one should find separately the _ partial _ contributions ( in absence of oscillations ) to the total rates of events of different type from the neutral current reactions : @xmath62 , from the charged current reactions induced by @xmath12 : @xmath63 , and from the charged current reactions induced by @xmath13 : @xmath64 in presence of oscillations these contributions will be modified by the flux suppression factors determined in ( [ ncrate ] , [ ncrate1 ] , [ ncrate2 ] ) .    the reaction ( [ pi0 ] ) gives the main contribution to the @xmath0-_events _ sample .",
    "however , contributions from other reactions are also relevant .",
    "let us consider them in order .",
    "the reaction of multi - pion production by the neutral currents : @xmath65 @xmath66 gives @xmath0-_event _ if only one @xmath0 is detected , whereas all charged pions are below the cherenkov threshold , and moreover , they do not produce secondaries which lead to an observable signal .",
    "the contribution from these reactions is roughly three times smaller than that from ( [ pi0 ] ) .",
    "also the neutral current reaction @xmath67 leads to @xmath0-_event _ if the @xmath68 undergoes the charge exchange .",
    "this contribution is , however , small .",
    "let us denote by @xmath69 the sum of all contributions from the @xmath8 reactions .",
    "there is a substantial contribution to @xmath0-_event _ sample from the @xmath6 reactions . in particular",
    ", @xmath70 leads to the @xmath0-_event _ if the muon energy is below the cherenkov threshold , and subsequent muon decay does not produce an observable signal . smaller contribution comes from reaction @xmath71 , where the pion exchanges the charge in subsequent nuclear interactions , and the muon is not detected .",
    "small contribution comes from the @xmath6 multi - pion reaction .",
    "let us denote the sum of all @xmath13 @xmath6 contributions by @xmath72    there are similar @xmath6-reactions induced by @xmath73 due to low cherenkov threshold , the probability for the electron to be undetected is smaller and the contribution from these reactions to @xmath0-_event _ sample , @xmath74 , is also small : @xmath75    the total rate of the @xmath0-_events _ in absence of oscillations equals @xmath76 and the relative partial contributions can be estimated as @xmath77 notice that this result depends on features of specific experiment and event selection criteria .",
    "the numbers in ( [ rel0 ] ) have been obtained using the table 5 from kajita review @xcite and correspond roughly to the kamiokande sub - gev sample .",
    "we estimate their uncertainties as @xmath78 and @xmath79 similar results are expected for the super - kamiokande . in",
    "what follows we will use ( [ rel0 ] ) for illustrative purpose , mainly , to estimate the sensitivity of the method .",
    "detailed comparison with experimental data requires recalculation of these numbers by experimental collaborations .",
    "0.5truecm    let us now consider the influence of different modes of oscillations on the rate of the @xmath0-_events_. the @xmath1 oscillations suppress @xmath80 contribution only : @xmath81 and the ratio of the rates with and without oscillations can be written as @xmath82 since @xmath83 does not exceed 20 - 25 % , one expects the decrease of the @xmath0-_event _ rate due to oscillations by 10 % at most .    for @xmath2 oscillations we get according to ( [ ncrate ] , [ ncrate1 ] , [ ncrate2 ] ) @xmath84 so the oscillations suppress the rate of @xmath0-_events _ at most by 5 % .",
    "in contrast , for the oscillations to the sterile neutrinos @xmath44 we have @xmath85 and the suppression is larger than 30 % .    to avoid the uncertainties related to the absolute values of the neutrino fluxes we will study the double ratios involving the @xmath0-_events _ and the e - like ( or @xmath3-like ) events : @xmath86 the rate of the e - like events without oscillations equals @xmath87 where @xmath88 @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are the partial contributions from the @xmath91 , @xmath8 and @xmath80 reactions correspondingly .",
    "the relative contributions at the super - kamiokande in the sub - gev events sample are : @xmath92 the comparison of different monte carlo simulations allow us to estimate possible spread of predictions : @xmath93 and @xmath94    in presence of oscillations the contributions in ( [ ne ] ) are modified by the flux suppression factors ( [ ncrate ] , [ ncrate1 ] , [ ncrate2 ] ) . in particular , for @xmath1 oscillations we get @xmath95 using eqs .",
    "( [ pipi0 ] ) and ( [ ee0 ] ) we find @xmath96 similarly one can find the double ratios for other modes of oscillations .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the predictions for different modes of oscillations in the @xmath97 plot .",
    "we have used the above formulas with relative contributions according ( [ rel0 ] , [ relat ] ) . notice that the curves for @xmath1 and @xmath44 differ , whereas the curves for @xmath44 and @xmath2 oscillations coincide in this plot .",
    "indeed , as follows from discussion in sect .  2",
    ", the value of @xmath57 changes only if there is a @xmath14 component in the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "this statement is not changed even if efficiencies of detection and misidentification of the samples are taken into account .",
    "clearly , it will be possible to disentangle the case of @xmath98 oscillations from @xmath99 using these ratios , although the difference is smaller than in the ideal case of fluxes .",
    "for @xmath100 we get from the figure @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 oscillations correspondingly .",
    "the ratio of the values of @xmath57 in the two cases is 0.77 , to be compared with 0.73 for @xmath26 ( [ rnue2 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can consider the double ratio @xmath103 in which the @xmath0-_events _ are compared with the multi - ring events .",
    "`` inclusive '' data subsets are numerically rich , but their interpretation is generally less simple . 0.5truecm    other samples of data can be used in tracking detectors with better identification of events ( soudan or icarus ) .",
    "let us consider the samples of two prong events : with two showers ( @xmath104-events ) , with two @xmath3-like tracks ( @xmath105-events ) , and with one shower and one @xmath3-like track ( @xmath106-events ) .",
    "these events are generated mainly by one pion production reactions .",
    "@xmath104 events are due to @xmath8 reaction ( [ pi0 ] ) , @xmath106 and @xmath105 events are due to the charged current reactions : @xmath107 a partial cancellation of the uncertainties in the cross - sections takes place in the double ratio : @xmath108 and in the analogous ratio @xmath109 these quantities can be alternatively used to estimate the neutral - to - charged - currents ratio . moreover ,",
    "some uncertainties related to nuclear effects are cancelled in this ratios at low energies , where @xmath110 production mechanism dominates .",
    "such a sample can be selected by imposing upper bound on the total visible energy .",
    "a diagnostic of this method is the study of the double ratio @xmath111 that in the ideal case should correspond to the usual double ratio @xmath112    we summarize the relevant reactions , the topology of the corresponding events and the rates in the table 1 .",
    ".reactions of pion production by the atmospheric neutrinos and their rates normalized to the rate of reaction @xmath113 , @xmath114 or nothing . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as follows from the table , the best agreement with the data is obtained under the @xmath1 oscillation hypothesis ( with a 15 - 25% excess of @xmath0-_events _ ) .",
    "let us estimate uncertainties in this analysis .",
    "the experimental ( statistical ) errors is related mostly to the small number of observed @xmath0-_events_. with present data it is about 15% , and it will decrease with the accumulation of statistics .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are much larger .",
    "the results of two calculations of the neutrino - induced single-@xmath115 production cross - sections by fogli - nardulli @xcite and rein - sehgal @xcite differ by 20% @xcite . using the results in sec .",
    "3.2 of @xcite we estimate the uncertainties related to the nuclear effects as being about the 20% .",
    "so , the overall uncertainty could be around 35 - 40% .",
    "already this uncertainty is larger than the differences in eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) or in fig .  1 , which means that at present it is impossible to exclude different channels of oscillations .    on top of this",
    "there is a possible neutron - induced background @xcite which can contribute significantly to the @xmath0 data .",
    "this background is more important for @xmath0 sample than for e - like sample considered in @xcite for two reasons : ( 1 ) smaller statistics of the @xmath0 events ; ( 2 ) the absence of suppression which exists for the e - like events , since only in 17% of the cases the neutron - produced neutral pions can fake an electron @xcite .",
    "the neutron background at kamiokande was below 30% .",
    "due to large size of the detector and the possibility to use central parts of the detector , the super - kamiokande can reduce possible effect of neutrons up to desired level .",
    "the study of neutral current observables , and in particular of the @xmath0-_events _ , can provide deeper insights in to the atmospheric neutrino problem .",
    "this study will give not only new independent check of the oscillation hypothesis , but also will allow one to discriminate between different channels of oscillations .",
    "an exciting perspective is related to the super - kamiokande operations . already to the end of 1998",
    "it will collect more that 300 @xmath0-_events _ @xcite .",
    "our tentative analysis of the recent sk data on neutral pions indicates a slight preference of the hypothesis of @xmath5 oscillations , even though ( as was emphasized ) the uncertainties are large .",
    "further data taking at the super - kamiokande will lead to desired decrease of the experimental errors .",
    "as far as predictions are concerned , the progress could come not only from new updated series of calculations @xcite but also from the future experimental studies of the neutrino induced single pion emission reactions at gev energies .",
    "these studies will be possible with the two front detectors of the k2k experiment @xcite , that will start to operate in the beginning of 1999 @xcite .",
    "the k2k collaboration plans also to search for the oscillation effects using @xmath0-_events _ directly @xcite . the ratio of events ( @xmath116-like ) in the front detector and in the super - kamiokande detector will be measured .",
    "however , it is not guaranteed that oscillation effects will be observable with the range of values of @xmath117 preferable now @xcite",
