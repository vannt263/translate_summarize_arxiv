    "hr 4049 is the prototype for a class of peculiar , post - agb , single - lined , long - period , spectroscopic binaries @xcite .",
    "the primary star of these binaries is an early - type supergiant with very peculiar abundances .",
    "most objects in this class exhibit strong infrared excesses of circumstellar origin with carbon - rich circumstellar dust typically present .",
    "the combination of carbon - rich material , high luminosity , and location out of the galactic plane forms the basis for the post - agb designation .",
    "the peculiar designation stems from a photospheric abundance pattern characterized by a severe deficiency of refractory ( high dust condensation temperature ) elements and a near - solar abundance for volatile ( low dust condensation temperature ) elements .",
    "the abundance anomalies indicate that the present photosphere contains material from which refractory elements have been very largely removed , i.e. , a winnowing of dust from gas has occurred .",
    "the basic characteristics of the prototype object hr 4049 are well known .",
    "the photosphere has an effective temperature of about 7500 k and shows extreme abundance differences between refractory and volatile elements : for example , hr 4049 has [ fe / h]@xmath13 - 4.8 but [ s / h]@xmath13 - 0.2 @xcite .",
    "the orbital period of hr 4049 is 430 days @xcite , leading to a minimum separation between the two stars of 190 r@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the orbit requires a phase of common envelope evolution when the primary was at the tip of the agb and had a radius of @xmath13 250 r@xmath3 .",
    "this phase altered the masses and abundances of the components .",
    "the hr 4049 infrared excess is pronounced redward of @xmath131 @xmath0 m and is very well fit by a single blackbody at a temperature of about 1150 k and attributed to radiation from the tall inner walls of an optically thick circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "a circumbinary keplerian rotating disk appears a common feature of the hr 4049 class of post - agb binaries @xcite .",
    "the inner walls of the hr 4049 circumbinary disk are @xmath13 10 au from the binary or 50 times the radius of the supergiant .",
    "our line of sight to the binary nearly grazes the edge of the disk ; the angle of inclination of the line of sight to the normal to the disk is about 60@xmath14 .",
    "a cartoon of the system is shown in figure 1 .",
    "superimposed on the infrared dust continuum are emission features .",
    "@xcite detected features due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "this result was confirmed by the iso / sws spectrum of @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirmed a c - rich circumstellar environment by detecting 3.43 and 3.53 @xmath0 m emission features later identified with hydrogen - terminated crystalline facets of diamond @xcite .",
    "remarkably , @xcite report that the gas molecular species seen in the infrared ( iso ) spectrum are those expected of an o - rich mixture , suggesting that the hr 4049 circumbinary environment is a blend of c - rich dust and o - rich gas .",
    "optical spectroscopy offers some information on the disk s gas .",
    "@xcite report changes in the h@xmath15 line profile with orbital phase . @xcite and @xcite detected a broad ( @xmath1315 km s@xmath6 ) stationary emission component in the na i d@xmath1 and [ o i ] 6300   lines which they attributed to the circumbinary disk .",
    "however , the infrared offers much more readily interpreted signatures of gas in and around the binary .",
    "@xcite detected the @xmath7c@xmath10o first overtone spectrum in absorption with an excitation temperature of about 300 k. @xcite on analyzing an iso / sws spectrum of co@xmath1 emission bands found strong contributions from isotopomers containing @xmath11o and @xmath16o which they interpreted as @xmath10o/@xmath11o = 8.3 @xmath17 2.3 and @xmath10o/@xmath16o = 6.9@xmath170.9 .",
    "the origins of the hr 4049 class of chemically peculiar supergiants and the structure of their circumbinary / circumstellar material remain ill - understood .",
    "new observational attacks appear to be essential . in this paper",
    "we report on a detailed look at several regions of the 2 - 5 @xmath0 m infrared spectrum of hr 4049 .",
    "the spectrum hr 4049 was observed at high resolution at a number of near - infrared wavelengths in the 2.3 to 4.6 @xmath0 m region using the 8 m gemini south telescope and the noao high - resolution near - infrared phoenix spectrometer @xcite .",
    "phoenix is a cryogenically cooled echelle spectrograph that uses order separating filters to isolate sections of individual echelle orders .",
    "the detector is a 1024@xmath181024 insb aladdin ii array .",
    "phoenix is not cross dispersed and the size of the detector in the dispersion direction limits the wavelength coverage in a single exposure to about 0.5% , i.e. 1550 km s@xmath6 , which is 0.012 @xmath0 m at 2.3 @xmath0 m ( 22 cm@xmath6 at 4300 cm@xmath6 ) and 0.024 @xmath0 m at 4.6 @xmath0 m ( 11 cm@xmath6 at 2100 cm@xmath6 ) .",
    "one edge of the detector is blemished so the wavelength coverage is typically trimmed a few percent to avoid this area . wavelength coverage is limited overall to 0.9 - 5.5 @xmath0 m by the insb detector material . all the spectra discussed here were observed with the widest ( 0.35 arcsecond ) slit resulting in a spectral resolution of r=@xmath20/@xmath21@xmath20= 50,000 .",
    "the central wavelengths of the regions observed are listed in table 1 .",
    "the thermal brilliance of the sky makes observations longward of @xmath134 @xmath0 m much more difficult than in the non - thermal 1 - 2.4@xmath0 m region .",
    "however , for a bright star like hr 4049 this only slightly increases the already short integration time .",
    "thermal infrared observations were done using standard infrared observing techniques @xcite .",
    "each observation consists of multiple integrations at several different positions along the slit , typically separated by 4  on the sky . at thermal infrared wavelengths the telluric lines are in emission . in order not to saturate the telluric emission lines the limiting exposure time is about 30 seconds at 4.6 @xmath0 m . for longer integration times",
    ", multiple exposures can be coadded in the array controller to make up a single exposure .",
    "however , hr 4049 is so bright that total exposure times of only 10 to 20 seconds were required .",
    "the delivered image fwhm at the spectrograph varied from 0.25 0.80during the nights that spectra were taken . with the positions along the slit separated by several arcseconds",
    "the resulting spectral images were well separated on the detector .",
    "an average flat observation minus an average dark observation was divided into each frame observed and frames with the star at different places along the slit were then differenced and the spectrum extracted using standard iraf routines .",
    "a hot star , with no intrinsic spectral lines in the regions observed , was also observed at each wavelength setting .",
    "the hot star was observed at airmass near that of hr 4049 and the hr 4049 spectrum was later divided by the hot star spectrum to ratio the telluric spectrum from the hr 4049 star spectrum .",
    "wavelength calibrations were computed by using a set of telluric wavelengths obtained from the hot star spectra .",
    "the wavelength calibration yielded residuals of typically 0.25 km s@xmath6 .",
    "observations of hr 4049 were taken in the 2 and 3 @xmath0 m region as well as the 4.6 @xmath0 m region . for a bright star",
    "the stellar signal is much stronger than background radiation in these spectral regions and as a result the observations are much less challenging than 4.6 @xmath0 m observations .",
    "the phoenix observing technique for this spectral region has previously been described in @xcite .",
    "observations of the 2.3 , 3.0 , and 4.6 @xmath0 m regions reveal lines from just three molecular species : co , oh , and h@xmath1o .",
    "as discussed in  1 , hr 4049 has a carbon - rich circumstellar envelope but we did not identify any molecules associated with conditions where c@xmath12o . in the 4.6 @xmath0 m region we searched for c@xmath22 and cn which should be prominent if c@xmath12o .",
    "rather , we report on the new detection of a rich 4.6 @xmath0 m forest of co fundamental and h@xmath1o lines .",
    "the 4.6 @xmath0 m region atomic hydrogen lines pfund @xmath23 and humphreys @xmath24 , if present , are blended with h@xmath1o lines . the 4.6 @xmath0 m hr 4049 emission line spectrum is very rich making the identification of occasional atomic features problematic .",
    "the circumstellar continuum at 4.6 @xmath0 m is approximately 25 times more intense than the continuum of the supergiant @xcite so features of stellar origin will be highly veiled . at 3 @xmath0 m we make a first detection of the oh fundamental vibration - rotation lines in hr 4049 . before exploring the emission line spectrum , we revisit in  3.1 the 2.3 @xmath0 m co first overtone spectrum detected previously by @xcite .",
    "all velocities in this paper are heliocentric . in order to compare",
    "heliocentric velocities of hr 4049 with microwave observations add -11.6 km s@xmath6 to convert to the local standard of rest .",
    "our observations confirm and extend the discovery of first - overtone ( @xmath21v=2 ) vibration - rotation co lines in absorption @xcite . at the 2.3 @xmath0 m wavelength of the co",
    "first overtone , the continuum from the dust is about four times that of the supergiant .",
    "thus , the co absorption lines should be formed along the lines of sight to the circumbinary disk . by inspection ( figure 2 ) , it is apparent that the rotational and vibrational temperatures are low ; high rotational lines of the 2 - 0 band are absent and the 3 - 1 ( and higher ) bands are weak or absent relative to the low rotational lines of the 2 - 0 band .",
    "all of the prominent lines are attributable to the most common isotopic variant , @xmath7c@xmath10o , but weak 2 - 0 @xmath8co lines are detectablec@xmath10o appears as co , etc . ] .",
    "the first set of observations from february 2002 show the co lines at a radial velocity of -33@xmath170.5 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the lines reach maximum strength at j@xmath137 , suggesting a rotational excitation temperature of @xmath13300 k. at j=7 , the r branch lines are about 17% deep and are resolved with a fwhm of 16 km s@xmath6 compared to the instrumental resolution of 6 km s@xmath6 .",
    "weak @xmath8co lines are detected with depths for the r18 to r23 lines of about 4% . comparing lines of similar",
    "excitation suggests that @xmath7c/@xmath8c@xmath1310 .",
    "the observed regions cover the strongest predicted c@xmath11o lines ( 2 - 0 lines near j@xmath13 7 ) but these lines can not be convincingly identified in the spectra ( figure 2 ) demanding c@xmath10o / c@xmath11o @xmath5100",
    ". a yet more stringent limit can be applied (  4 ) by modeling .",
    "after the original observations , additional data were collected to extend the excitation range of the lines .",
    "for instance , observations made in december 2002 included higher j lines than observed previously .",
    "observations in december 2005 covered the low j p branch required for curve - of - growth analysis .",
    "some wavelength intervals were reobserved over the 2002  2005 interval to check for variability .",
    "the radial velocity was in all cases unchanged from the -33 km s@xmath6 measured in the original data set .",
    "this velocity is nearly equal to the -32.09 @xmath170.13 km s@xmath6 systemic velocity of the spectroscopic binary @xcite .    the co first overtone line profiles are symmetrical with no hint of an emission component .",
    "the line strengths showed no temporal variability .",
    "in fact , the line intensities are quite similar to those reported by @xcite .",
    "similarly , the velocity is identical to the earlier reported value .",
    "the profile of the lowest excitation line , 2 - 0 r0 , differs from others in that it possibly has a weak blue - shifted component .",
    "however , the 2 - 0 r0 line lies in a region with a complex telluric spectrum which is difficult to ratio out of the hr 4049 spectrum . in the february 2003 spectrum ,",
    "the 2 - 0 r0 line appears to have components at -23.6 and -32.9 km s@xmath6 . on other dates ,",
    "the blue - shifted component is less clearly resolved suggesting that it is either of variable velocity , affected by overlying emission of variable intensity and/or velocity , or a relic of the reduction process .",
    "if this blue - shifted component exists , it must originate in very cold gas ( t @xmath25 5 k ) because the component is not detectable in the 2 - 0 r1 line .      in sharp contrast to the spectrum at 2.3 @xmath0 m where",
    "a sparse collection of weak absorption lines are found , the spectrum near 4.6 @xmath0 m is rich in emission lines ( figure 3 ) .",
    "emission lines were identified from four isotopic variants : co , @xmath8co , c@xmath11o , and c@xmath16o with roughly equal intensities for all variants .",
    "the rarer isotopic variants @xmath8c@xmath11o , @xmath8c@xmath16o , and @xmath26co were searched for but are not present .",
    "absorption below the local continuum is also seen in the profiles of the lowest excitation 1 - 0 co lines in this interval .",
    "the observed spectral interval provides lines mostly from the 1 - 0 and 2 - 1 co bands but a few r branch lines of the 3 - 2 co band are clearly present .",
    "the maximum observable rotational level , j@xmath1330 , is similar to that seen in the co first overtone .",
    "table 2 lists the detected fundamental lines of the four co isotopic forms .",
    "blending with other lines of different co isotopes , vibration - rotation transitions , or h@xmath1o lines is common and results in an apparent variety of profiles .",
    "all unblended emission lines are double - peaked  see figures 4  8 . for all but the lowest excitation lines the blue and red peaks are of similar intensity , but characteristically with the blue peak slightly weaker than the red , and occur at velocities of -38.9 @xmath170.4 and -28.4 @xmath17 0.5 km s@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the central valley of the emission profile has a velocity of -33.7 @xmath17 0.3 km s@xmath6 .",
    "velocities are not dependent on the isotopic species .",
    "the observed , i.e. uncorrected for instrumental profile , full - width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) of the emission profile for the weaker lines is @xmath13 27 km s@xmath6 , with stronger lines having fwzi up to @xmath13 35 km s@xmath6 . due to the high line density ,",
    "the fwzi is a difficult parameter to measure and our values carry an uncertainty of several km s@xmath6 .",
    "the observed full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) similarly depends on the line strength but much less dramatically than the fwzi .",
    "typical fwhm values are @xmath13 19 km s@xmath6 .    at the observed resolution of @xmath20/@xmath27=50000 ,",
    "the instrument profile has a significant impact on the observed line profiles and fwzi . assuming a gaussian instrumental profile equal to the 6 km s@xmath6 fwhm spectral resolution , deconvolution of this instrumental profile from the observed line profile gives a true fwzi of 18 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the line profiles are strongly smoothed by the instrumental profile .",
    "the observations show blue and red sides of the co lines rising @xmath1320% above the body of typical co emission lines with the peak at each edge having a fwhm of @xmath13 4 km s@xmath6 . for more strongly saturated lines ,",
    "e.g. low excitation @xmath8co lines the fwhm of the blue and red emission spikes are @xmath138 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the intrinsic profile clearly has much stronger emission peaks .",
    "the combined absorption - emission profile for the 1 - 0 co lines is shown best by the r2 and r5 lines ( figure 9 ) .",
    "after allowance for similar blends , the profiles of the co r1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 lines can be judged very similar to that of the r5 line .",
    "the profile of the r0 line is possibly of the same type but blending is more severe .",
    "the r5 profile is almost a p cygni profile : blue absorption accompanied by red emission .",
    "however , the absorption component is not strongly blue shifted but has a velocity very similar to that of the absorption lines in the other fundamental lines and to that of the 2 - 0 lines .",
    "absorption below the continuum is seen only in the 1 - 0 p and r branch co lines ( figure 3  8) .",
    "the observed interval includes the p1 , p2 , p3 and r0 , r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 , and r5 lines with definite absorption below the local continuum seen in all these lines except p1 and r0 .",
    "the strength of the absorption at r5 suggests absorption below the local continuum should be detectable to higher j lines of the r branch .",
    "due to the isotopic shifts , the low j 1 - 0 lines of the isotopic variants are not in the observed interval .",
    "the lowest member of the r branch in our spectra is j  = 9 for @xmath8co , j  = 10 for c@xmath16o , and j  = 3 for c@xmath11o .",
    "all the 1 - 0 lines regardless of isotopic species have a stronger central valley than the vibrationally excited transitions .",
    "the valley almost reaches the local continuum for the 1 - 0 @xmath8co lines ( note @xmath8co 1 - 0 r10 and r11 in figure 7 ) .",
    "the central valley in the line profiles becomes asymmetric for the stronger lines .",
    "self - absorption of the blue emission is obvious when comparing the strength of the blue and red emission in profiles of the 1 - 0 co lines ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the 1 - 0 co line central absorptions are on average 76% broader on the blue side than the red side .",
    "the weaker @xmath8co 1 - 0 central absorptions are 20% broader on the blue side .",
    "the central absorption is systemically blue shifted relative to the @xmath28 velocity of the binary @xcite for the very lowest excitation lines .",
    "the shift increases with decreasing j ",
    ", with a shift of 1 km s@xmath6 for r5 and 3.5 km s@xmath6 for r2 ( figure 10 ) .",
    "the intensities of the emission lines of co , @xmath8co , c@xmath11o , and c@xmath16o are remarkably similar and quite different from the abundance ratios estimated from the 2 - 0 lines .",
    "peak intensities of the following representative unblended lines illustrate this point : + co : 1 - 0 r2 28% , 2 - 1 r11 27% , 3 - 2 r11 11% + @xmath8co : 1 - 0 r12 24% , 2 - 1 r17",
    "14% + c@xmath11o : 1 - 0 r11 9% , 2 - 1 r17",
    "14% + c@xmath16o : 1 - 0 r14 14% + in contrast to the ratio co/@xmath8co @xmath13 10 from the 2 - 0 lines , the co/@xmath8co intensity ratio from 1 - 0 and 2 - 1 lines of similar j is about 1.5 .",
    "even more striking is the appearance of fundamental lines of c@xmath11o and c@xmath16o with intensities about one - half that of similar lines of co. yet , co / c@xmath11o @xmath12 100 from the first - overtone lines .",
    "the simplest interpretation of these contrasting ratios is that emitting regions are optically thick in all the observed fundamental lines .",
    "as is well known , the first - overtone transitions are much weaker than the fundamental lines .",
    "optically thin emission in fundamental and first - overtone lines from a common upper state in the second vibrational level will differ by a factor of about 100 in flux . in the case of absorption from a common state in the ground vibrational level ,",
    "the absorption coefficient of the 1 - 0 line is similarly about factor of 100 stronger than the 2 - 0 line .",
    "the strengthening of the central absorption for the lowest energy vibrational transition , the asymmetric absorption , and absorption below the continuum require the presence of an absorbing gas cooler than the emitting gas .",
    "this absorbing gas has a velocity shifted to the blue of the system barycentric velocity ( -32.1 km s@xmath6 ) by 1 to 3.5 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the emitting gas covers a @xmath1318 km s@xmath6 range of velocity but is also shifted by @xmath13 - 1.5 km s@xmath6 relative to the barycentric velocity .",
    "the lowest excitation oh vibration - rotation 1 - 0 lines are in a region of considerable telluric obscuration .",
    "j=4.5 is the lowest oh level accessible under typical water vapor conditions ( a few mm of precipitable h@xmath1o ) at gemini south .",
    "however , a suitable order sorting filter was not available for the j=4.5 wavelength .",
    "an observation was made of the p branch line region for j=5.5 .",
    "the @xmath29 oh ground state results in @xmath30-doubled rotational levels , so each rotational line is divided into four components . as a result , in spite of the large rotational line spacing for oh , several oh lines can appear in a phoenix spectrum taken with a single grating setting . the 3.0 @xmath0 m 1 - 0 p@xmath315.5 and p@xmath325.5 lines were detected in the spectrum of hr 4049 ( fig .",
    "this spectral region has considerable telluric absorption .",
    "the removal of this absorption results in variable noise in the ratioed spectrum .",
    "the oh lines are , as are the co lines , seen in emission .",
    "the profiles are similar to those of co with double peaked profiles of observed fwzi @xmath1326 km s@xmath6 centered at -35 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the two oh lines observed are just 5% above the continuum .",
    "these were the only lines that were detected in the 3.0 @xmath0 m spectral region observed .",
    "the asymmetric top molecule h@xmath1o is known for the complexity , apparent lack of rotational structure , and richness of its spectrum . as a result",
    "h@xmath1o lines are much more challenging to identify than vibration - rotation lines of simple diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "emission lines are clearly present in the 4.6 @xmath0 m hr 4049 spectrum from three vibration - rotation bands : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . with the above caveats on the h@xmath1o spectrum and based on the tentative identification of four lines",
    ", the vibrationally excited band @xmath36 possibly also contributes to the 4.6 @xmath0 m spectrum .",
    "the strongest observed h@xmath1o transitions are from the @xmath35 band .",
    "a number of lines identified with this band have intensities @xmath1320% above continuum .",
    "typical h@xmath1o lines are weaker than typical co lines , with many of the h@xmath1o lines identified having intensity @xmath3710% above continuum .    table 3 presents a list of the h@xmath1o lines tentatively identified in the hr 4049 spectrum . in figures 4 - 9 these lines are labeled on the spectrum of hr 4049 .",
    "many lines ( e.g. figure 9 ) are unblended and clearly present .",
    "however , a fairly large number are blended with co or other h@xmath1o lines . due to the overlapping h@xmath1o energy levels , the line strengths of h@xmath1o lines can vary significantly between adjacent vibration - rotational transitions and , hence , the contribution of a h@xmath1o line to a blend is uncertain .    the band strength , @xmath38 , is a factor of five lower for the @xmath34 band than the @xmath35 band .",
    "however , the band strength for the @xmath33 band is more than 10@xmath39 higher than that of either of these bands @xcite .",
    "the origin of the @xmath33 band is @xmath131.5 @xmath0 m red of the region observed . while it would be of interest to observe the lowest excitation @xmath33 lines , for ground based observers the telluric @xmath33 lines are very strong and prevent observations in 6 @xmath0 m region .",
    "the @xmath36 band has similar band strength to the @xmath34 and @xmath35 combination bands but , unlike these bands which have origins in the regions observed , @xmath36 has an origin near that of @xmath33 .",
    "this adds to our suspicion of the @xmath36 identifications .",
    "like co and oh lines the 4.6 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o lines have a double peaked profile with emission peaks at -38.6 and -29.2 km s@xmath6 and absorption at -33.6 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the observed fwzi of the weaker h@xmath1o lines is @xmath1325 km s@xmath6 , perhaps slightly more narrow than the co lines .",
    "in addition to the observed 4.6 @xmath0 m transitions , h@xmath1o also has low excitation transitions in the 3.0 and 2.3 @xmath0 m regions .",
    "in particular the @xmath40 band crosses the 3 @xmath0 m region and has a band strength similar to that of the @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath41 band is also present in the 3 @xmath0 m region and , while weaker than @xmath33 or @xmath40 , is a much stronger transition than the combination bands seen at 4.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "our 3.0 @xmath0 m observation has an uneven continuum perhaps as a result of weak emission features .",
    "we undertook a detailed search for h@xmath1o lines but failed to identify any 3.0 @xmath0 m h@xmath1o lines .",
    "future searches of this region for h@xmath1o lines using higher signal - to - noise data and wider wavelength coverage are justified . on the other hand ,",
    "our spectra in the 2.3 @xmath0 m region are of very high quality with broad wavelength coverage and this region is clearly devoid of any contribution from h@xmath1o .      in summary of the above subsections , co vibration - rotation fundamental lines of four differently isotopically substituted species and h@xmath1o vibration - rotation lines populate the 4.6 @xmath0 m region .",
    "these lines all have double peaked emission profiles of total ( including both peaks ) fwhm @xmath13 19 km s@xmath6 .",
    "there is little difference of intensity between lines of different isotopes .",
    "the lowest excitation lines , which are only seen in @xmath7c@xmath10o in the wavelength range observed , have a central absorption as much as 20% below the local continuum .",
    "this central absorption overwhelms the bluest of the double peaks in the emission profile but the extreme bluest edge of the emission remains .",
    "examples of observed co fundamental and h@xmath1o line profiles are given in fig .",
    "oh lines from the fundamental vibration - rotation transition were seen in the 3 @xmath0 m region .",
    "the oh lines are in emission with double peaked profiles similar to those seen in the co fundamental and h@xmath1o lines .",
    "the co vibration - rotation first - overtone transition appears in absorption in the 2.3 @xmath0 m region .",
    "the absorption lines are nearly as broad as the co emission lines , fwhm @xmath13 16 km s@xmath6 , but have simple gaussian profiles and exhibit a range of line depths suggesting the lines are optically thin .",
    "@xmath7co dominates but weaker @xmath8co is detectable .",
    "the oxygen isotopes are not present .",
    "all spectral lines in the 2 - 5 @xmath0 m region have a small ( @xmath42  1 km s@xmath6 ) shift blue of the systemic velocity .",
    "the fundamental spectrum presents a difficult analysis task .",
    "the co is seen in both emission and , for the very lowest excitation co lines , absorption .",
    "the small change in intensity for emission lines over the full range of isotopes and over a large range of excitation energy ( rotational levels j\"=0 to 30 and vibrational transitions 1 - 0 to 3 - 2 ) clearly indicates that the emission lines are very saturated",
    ". a detailed investigation of these strongly saturated lines would require detailed radiative transfer and disk modeling beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "although of the current data is of higher precision , both data sets are consistent with an outflow velocity of @xmath131 km s@xmath6 .",

    "a 0.5 km s@xmath6 width is consistent with thermal broadening .",
    "we suggest that the broadening to 16 km s@xmath6 is due to a systemic flow of gas in the circumstellar shell .",
    "as noted above , our view of the dust disk continuum is limited to the side opposite from the star ( figure 1 ) , so many kinds of axisymmetric flows could result in the observed line broadening .",
    "we consider the line shapes to constrain further our understanding of the flow .",
    "all the unblended 4.6 @xmath0 m emission line profiles , including those for weaker lines , are double peaked .",
    "since @xmath60 the lines are double peaked , we discount self - absorption as the principal cause for this line shape .",
    "double peaked lines suggest an origin in a rotating ring or disk .",
    "the observation of co fundamental band absorption demands a p - cygni type geometry , i.e. , an emitting area extended relative to the continuum forming area . while emission is very dominant in the 4.6 @xmath0 m hr 4049 spectrum , there is a hint of underlying and offset absorption in all the lines with the emission line profiles having a lower peak on the blue side than on the red side .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by saturated lines 10 - 20% above the continuum . however , some lines are stronger and we assume these stronger lines result as optical thick transitions cover larger areas . at 3 @xmath0 m radiation from a 550 k blackbody is about half that at 4.6 @xmath0 m and , indeed , the 3 @xmath0 m oh @xmath21v=1 lines are @xmath135% above continuum .",
    "ultimately saturation combined with the physical extent of the line forming region demands a limited range of emission line strengths .",
    "the strongest lines in the 4.6 @xmath0 m co spectrum of hr 4049 are @xmath1340% above the dust continuum .",
    "the simple model of a rotating disk can be applied to the existing disk model ( figure 1 ) and tested by producing model profiles of the lines .",
    "the co first overtone lines suggest that most of the co occurs in a relatively thin layer .",
    "an absorption line was modeled by assuming a continuum source of 10 au radius .",
    "the layer of absorbing gas was divided into zones of 0.1 au along the circumference .",
    "the line rms was assumed to be 0.5 km s@xmath6 and the gas was assumed to be rotating in a keplerian orbit .",
    "the resulting profile is a double peaked absorption line .",
    "this profile was then convolved with a gaussian instrumental profile with 6 km s@xmath6 fwhm . the resulting synthetic profile , which is an excellent match to observations , is shown in figure 13 .",
    "is this model also consistent with the 4.6 @xmath0 m emission line shapes ? to investigate this question five assumptions were made : ( 1 ) the emissivity of the gas is constant over the entire region modeled .",
    "( 2 ) the gas is in keplerian orbits .",
    "( 3 ) line broadening is limited to the thermal b value , 0.5 km s@xmath6 discussed above and the broadening from the keplerian motion .",
    "( 4 ) absorption is insignificant .",
    "( 5 ) the gas originates at 10 au and extends to larger radii .",
    "since the dust disk is opaque this extension is along the top of the disk ( figure 1 ) .",
    "an extension to larger radii was included since there is no requirement for a background continuum source for the emission line spectrum . to fit the profiles with this model we found a maximum radius of 14 au .",
    "as for the overtone model , the disk was divided into zones , the profile from each zone shifted and weighted by the viewing aspect , and then summed into velocity bins of 0.1 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the resultant double - peaked profile of the emission line is seen in figure 14 .",
    "convolution with a gaussian instrumental profile of fwhm = 6 km s@xmath6 produced a good match to a typical emission line .",
    "while consistency between the modeled and observed profiles is satisfying , the fundamental transitions clearly require much more refined modeling to address a number of details .",
    "for instance , there is a large difference between the 550 k co and 1150 k dust temperatures . if , as is commonly assumed ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the gas and dust temperatures are in equilibrium within the disk then the 1150 k dust temperature applies only to a surface layer .",
    "radiative cooling from co fundamental emission @xcite is largely disabled by the large optical depth of the co lines @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that the gas undergoes heating on exiting the disk .    in an isothermal model optically thick co self - absorption occurs for the fundamental transitions ; the opacity in the low j 1 - 0 is @xmath13400 .",
    "the fundamental lines are seen in emission because the the 550 k temperature of the co makes optically thick co lines brighter at 4.6 @xmath0 m than the 1150 k continuum . at the resolution of the observations , 6 km s@xmath6 ,",
    "narrow self - absorption lines of 0.5 km s@xmath6 width are largely smeared out .",
    "additionally , the gas is certainly not isothermal . if , for instance , the gas is heated as it leaves the disk , the temperature profile could increase toward the observer .",
    "depending on the details of the spatial filling , optical depth , and temperature profile absorption is not a requirement .",
    "two temperatures were measured in the co first overtone , @xmath1340 and @xmath13550 k but no velocity differences were measured between the 40 k and 550 k regions , suggesting that these temperature regions are physically close together .",
    "both the 40 k and 550 k co are seen in absorption against the 1150 k continuum .",
    "h@xmath1o , on the other hand , is seen only in emission .",
    "emission lines are not spatially limited to the 1150 k continuum forming region . if the absence of h@xmath1o absorption results from h@xmath1o existing only in the disk edge region and not in the disk mid - plane , the gas is differentiated vertically as well as horizontally relative to the plane of the disk .",
    "the measured decrease in the column density in between the v=0 and v=1 levels implies that there is ample population to produce the observed optically thick 2 - 1 lines .",
    "however , the observation of optically thick 3 - 2 emission suggests that the v=3 level is populated above that expected from lte .",
    "overtone transitions higher than 3 - 1 are outside of the region observered .",
    "it would be of interest to search for the strongest lines in the 4 - 2 band .",
    "the emission profile is shifted relative to the center - of - mass velocity by @xmath131.5 km s@xmath6 , suggesting an outflow .",
    "if the depression of the blue wing in the emission profiles is due to absorption in front of the dust disk , the absorption line profile is formed in a region with less outflow than the extended emission line forming region .",
    "outflow was also noted for the first overtone co lines .",
    "the outflow increases for the very lowest excitation lines , suggesting that the gas cools in the inner - disk region and is accelerated as it flows out . for the lowest excitation co fundamental lines",

    "four isotopic variants ( @xmath7c@xmath10o , @xmath8c@xmath10o , @xmath7c@xmath11o , and @xmath7c@xmath16o ) can be seen in the fundamental spectrum with lines of similar intensity .",
    "the co@xmath1 bands measured by @xcite were observed at low resolution by iso and are in the 13 - 17 @xmath0 m region of the infrared .",
    "these bands appear in emission .",
    "we contend that the oxygen isotope ratios appear small in these co@xmath1 bands because , as for the co fundamental , the emission lines are highly saturated .",
    "@xcite warn that their isotopic ratios are in the optically thin limit .",
    "the carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios appear typical for an agb star @xcite . while the oxygen isotopic ratio in the circumstellar environment of hr 4049 is not abnormally low , there are stars that do have extreme oxygen isotope values .",
    "some hydrogen deficient carbon stars have @xmath10o/@xmath16o considerably less than 1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the extreme overabundance of @xmath16o observed in these objects is the result of he - burning in white dwarf mergers .",
    "meteoritic samples have been found with small @xmath10o/@xmath16o ratios .",
    "these could result from processes in the pre - solar nebula or pollution from a stellar source . while the rarity of stellar sources with small oxygen isotope ratios suggests a stellar source is unlikely , the origin of exotic oxygen isotopic ratios detected in early solar system samples remains uncertain @xcite .",
    "iso data described by @xcite contain features from oxygen - rich molecules implying that the disk is oxygen - rich .",
    "the lack of mid - infrared silicate features associated with oxygen - rich grains is attributed by @xcite to high optical depth in the dust disk .",
    "our observations reveal a 2.3  4.6 @xmath0 m spectrum resulting from a mix of gas phase molecules , co , oh , and h@xmath1o , typical for an oxygen - rich environment .",
    "if , as seems probable , the gas consists of volatiles evaporated from grains then the disk environment is oxygen rich .    in contrast , as reviewed in  1 , carbon - rich circumstellar grains have been observed .",
    "an explanation is that these grains are exterior to the disk .",
    "carbon - rich chemistry is the result of evolution in the agb phase where cno material processed in the stellar interior is mixed to the surface . for agb stars of mass",
    "@xmath59 2 , the surface chemistry of the agb star is converted to carbon - rich by the third dredge up .",
    "rapid agb mass loss then produces a carbon - rich circumstellar shell . in the case of hr 4049",
    "the fossil carbon - rich shell of agb mass loss is still observable although hr 4049 is now a post - agb object .",
    "why is the disk oxygen - rich ?",
    "@xcite noted that the current binary separation is less than the radius required for the agb phase of the current post - agb star .",
    "hence , prior to the post - agb stage the hr 4049 system underwent common envelope evolution . prior to the common envelope",
    "phase the system passed through a pre - agb contact binary phase with the more massive star transferring mass onto the less massive member .",
    "an agb star does not contract due to mass loss , so the agb star continued to expand enveloping the dwarf companion .",
    "common envelope systems rapidly eject mass from both members @xcite .",
    "most carbon stars have c / o near unity @xcite . mixing or mass transfer during the common - envelope stage converted the carbon - rich envelope of the agb star back to an oxygen - rich envelope .",
    "mass lost during the common - envelope phase formed the current circumbinary disk .",
    "in such a scenario a co - rotating circumbinary disk is formed surrounding the binary @xcite .",
    "this process is apparently not unusual .",
    "@xcite find that circumbinary disks are a common feature of post - agb stars .",
    "the current a - supergiant m - dwarf hr 4049 binary is rapidly evolving to a white - dwarf m - dwarf binary system .",
    "white - dwarf m - dwarf binary systems with a co - binary disk resulting from common - envelope evolution also appear to be common @xcite .",
    "the 2 to 5 @xmath0 m spectrum of hr 4049 is formed in a circumbinary disk and wind .",
    "the optically thin 2.3 @xmath0 m co lines appear in absorption against the dust continuum , allowing the determination of the mass of gas .",
    "the gas forms a thin layer , of radial thickness @xmath13 6 r@xmath3 , lining the dust disk .",
    "this gas is composed of the volatiles separated in the disk from grains .",
    "the 4.6 @xmath0 m emission spectrum requires a region of line formation extended beyond the continuum forming region .",
    "the circumbinary gas is rotating with a keplerian velocity of @xmath13 9 km s@xmath6 .",
    "combined with the circumbinary disk radius and inclination derived from photometry , keplerian rotation allows the determination of the masses of the individual binary stars .",
    "the very low mass of the a supergiant , 0.58 m@xmath3 , confirms the post - agb nature of this object .",
    "gas is also flowing out of the system , perhaps as a result of a disk pressure gradient , at @xmath131 km s@xmath6 .",
    "our observations show that the hr 4049 circumbinary disk has typical agb abundances for the carbon and oxygen isotopes ; @xmath7c/@xmath8c = 6@xmath9 and @xmath10o/@xmath11o @xmath12200 .",
    "exotic mechanisms , as proposed e.g.  by @xcite , for production of the @xmath10o/@xmath11o are not required .",
    "the widely quoted value of @xmath10o/@xmath11o @xmath13 8 reported by @xcite results from the naive interpretation that the infrared emission lines are optically thin .",
    "@xcite warn that their values were in the optically thin limit .",
    "the extreme saturation of lines in the 4.6 @xmath0 m spectrum of hr 4049 results in nearly equal apparent strengths for isotopic variants of molecular species with abundances differing by factors of 10@xmath68 .",
    "the peculiar surface abundances of hr 4049 are likely the result of winnowing driven by the evaporation of volatiles in the disk and the viscous accretion of this gas onto the star .",
    "detailed modeling of the process will be required to determine if there is adequate time for the current outgassing of the disk to fully explain the surfaces abundances of the a supergiant or if a sudden , post - common envelope clearing of the inner disk is required .",
    "the existence of the @xmath20 boo stars shows that the winnowing process applies to pre - main sequence as well as post - agb systems .",
    "the wider significance of the winnowing process may well be in systems where the convective nature of the stellar photosphere cancels any impact on stellar abundances . however , circumstellar grains in these systems are undergoing processes separating volatile and refractory elements .",
    "this winnowing could have general application to the chemical evolution of grains in pre - main sequence disks .",
    "carbon - rich circumstellar material implies that the post - agb star was a carbon - rich star on the agb .",
    "the current oxygen - rich circumstellar disk likely evolved from common envelope mixing .",
    "hr 4049 is one of five known post - agb stars with similar photospheric abundances .",
    "of the other four at least one , the red - rectangle nebula / binary hd 44179 , has a similar oxygen - rich circumbinary disk in a carbon - rich circumstellar shell @xcite . in future papers of this series",
