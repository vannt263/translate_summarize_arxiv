    "the classical shallow water equations  @xcite describe the propagation of long waves on a free surface under the assumption that the flow under consideration is potential . in this model , only the averaged over depth velocities are used in the formulation of the governing equations . however , in practice , fluid flows are sheared , which is mainly due to viscosity effects near boundaries . obviously , for a more accurate modelling of the wave propagation it is necessary to also take into account non - uniformity of the flow .",
    "an extension of the classical shallow water theory to a vortical fluid flow was proposed by burns  @xcite , who was the first to study a plane parallel shear flow of inviscid fluid in linear approximation and derive the dispersion relation for normal modes . in this case , the speed of perturbation propagation is determined by an integral relation depending on the horizontal velocity profile over depth .",
    "a nonlinear model of long surface waves in shear flow was derived by benney  @xcite and represents an integrodifferential system of equations in sharp contrast with the quasilinear system for potential flow .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown in @xcite that the benney system can be written in the form of the so called infinite - component moment chain and , similar to the classical shallow water equations , possesses infinitely many conservation laws .",
    "zakharov  @xcite established equivalence between the benney system and the vlasov kinetic equation , and teshukov et al .",
    "@xcite found an explicit transformation between these two models .",
    "kupershmidt and manin  @xcite , lebedev and manin @xcite found local hamiltonian structure and the lax pair respectively for the benney system .",
    "families of exact solutions , having the structure of travelling and simple waves , were constructed and interpreted by freeman  @xcite , sachdev  @xcite , varley and blythe  @xcite and teshukov et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "zakharov  @xcite considered the first non - trivial multi - component reduction of the benney system for multi - layered fluid , proved its integrability and constructed a complete infinite set of conservation laws for this reduction .",
    "zakharov s multilayer reduction has the following important property : at each point @xmath6 the horizontal components of the velocity within each layer are constant and distinct .",
    "this property prevents the applicability of zakharov s reduction to the description of actual multilayer shallow water flows since sliding between layers is unusual .",
    "stability of shear flows for the full euler equations is a fundamental problem of fluid mechanics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the classical stability and instability criteria formulated in terms of growth of linear perturbations ( rayleigh , fjortoft ) are usually obtained for flows between rigid walls .",
    "some recent works use the generalized notion of stability as the well - posedness of time evolution , i.e. hyperbolicity ( see  @xcite ) , but they also consider either flows under closed lid or use periodic boundary conditions in the vertical direction which greatly simplifies the analysis . however , the presence of free surface can obviously change the flow stability criteria and , to our knowledge , stability of shallow water shear flows with a free surface has not been studied before .",
    "we note that , being an integrodifferential system , the benney equations can not be directly classified in terms of hyperbolicity .",
    "a generalized theory of characteristics and the notion of hyperbolicity for integrodifferential equations of the long wave theory was introduced by teshukov  @xcite .",
    "recently chesnokov and khe  @xcite revealed an analogue of landau damping for the benney equations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the necessary preliminaries on the hyperbolicity of the benney equations in sense of @xcite .",
    "we then show that , if the velocity profile over vertical coordinate is smooth , then monotonicity and convexity of the velocity profile is sufficient for the stability of flows with a free surface .",
    "we also extend this result for the fjortoft - like velocity profiles . using the vlasov - like formulation of the governing equations we reveal analogy between the criteria of the stability of the plasma waves and shear flows . in section 3",
    "we derive the models corresponding to the class of flows with a piecewise linear ( continuous or discontinuous ) velocity profile .",
    "we then formulate sufficient conditions for the stability of such multilayer flows .",
    "the study of stability is based on the verification of the hyperbolicity condition for the governing equations .",
    "we also reveal some important mathematical properties of the equations of multilayer flows ( the existence of riemann invariants and the hamiltonian structure , which implies integrability ) .",
    "it should be stressed that our approximation of the benney equations for shear flows with piecewise constant vorticity is an important `` upgrade '' of the classical zakharov reduction  @xcite as it admits a class of physically natural continuous velocity profiles . in section 4 ,",
    "we consider two - layer stratified flows with a piecewise linear velocity profile .",
    "we show that the generalization of previous results to the case of stratified flows is hardly possible .",
