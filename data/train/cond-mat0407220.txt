    "the development of efficient computational methods for the study of rare events is a subject of intense current interest and research across many disciplines @xcite .",
    "direct microscopic ( e.g. , molecular dynamics or kinetic monte carlo ) simulations of rare events can be extremely time - consuming since most of the computational time is spent sampling the free energy surface close to local free energy minima and the transition states are sampled only during an exponentially small fraction of the simulation time .",
    "many systems can be successfully described through a low - dimensional _ effective free - energy surface _ in terms of dynamically meaningful observable quantities ( often referred to as  reaction coordinates \" , see for example the discussion in ref .  ) . in such cases",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the evolution of the probability density of the variables that parameterize this surface may be described in terms of an effective fokker - planck ( fp ) equation .",
    "the deterministic part of the fp equation will then contain the gradient of the effective free energy surface with respect to the few  coarse \" variables ( reaction coordinates ,  observables \" ) chosen to parameterize it , as well as the local diffusivity of the expected motion .    in many cases of practical interest ,",
    "this effective fp equation is not available in closed form .",
    "recently , hummer and kevrekidis  @xcite have proposed a so called kinetic approach that bypasses the analytical derivation of such an equation , and uses the concept of its existence to guide the detailed ( molecular dynamics , monte carlo ) simulations . in this approach",
    ", the components of the effective fp equation are estimated through multiple , relatively short microscopic simulations with judiciously chosen initial conditions .    in this paper , we apply this kinetic approach to monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of self - assembly of surfactant molecules into micelles .",
    "we consider a lattice model @xcite with only short - range hydrophobic interactions between the molecules .",
    "the  dynamics \" of these simulations are artificial ; the kinetic approach allows us to explore the free energy surface using this artificial dynamic evolution .",
    "indeed , in section  [ s : mix ] we show that the free energy surface predicted by the kinetic approach does not depend on a particular choice of the mc",
    " dynamics \" .",
    "moreover , we expect that the methods and conclusions of this work can also be applied to real - time , ( molecular - dynamic ) simulations of self - assembly .",
    "the assumption of an effective - fp ( and associated langevin ) dynamics of micelle formation is a departure from the usual assumption of the first order activated process of addition ( removal ) of single amphiphile molecules to ( from ) a micelle @xcite .",
    "however , we show that the effective langevin equation model performs well for the considered system ; this suggests a link between the effective langevin description and the master equation of the activated process model .",
    "this link needs to be investigated in the future .    in the companion paper @xcite ( paper i )",
    ", we have considered  dynamics \" of mc simulations of micelle formation and have discussed the application of the multiscale coarse projective integration and coarse newton methods to these systems .",
    "we have observed that , as in the real physical dynamics , the rate - limiting step in the mc  dynamics \" is the birth and death of micelles ( as opposed to , e.g. , altering of micelle shape and size as the external parameters are changed ) . in paper",
    "i , we have used the first two moments of the micelle number density as our coarse variables ( reaction coordinates,observables \" ) .",
    "in addition , we have performed the coarse computations of the system using a kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) model for micelle birth and death with the rates obtained from the full - scale equilibrium simulation .    in the current paper",
    ", we compute the micelle formation rates directly from short - time mc simulations using the kinetic approach .",
    "the coarse variables here are the variables that characterize micelle size and shape .",
    "we assume that the coarse variables that can be used to parameterize a free energy surface description can be selected among physical attributes ( such as size , energy , radius of gyration ) of a cluster of surfactant molecules . based on computational evidence supporting the existence of effectively one - dimensional long - term dynamics",
    ", we use a single coarse degree of freedom ( a single  reaction coordinate \" , the cluster size ) to parameterize the effective free energy surface and show that the remaining coarse degrees of freedom relax quickly to functions of ( become slaved to ) a single  master mode \" .",
    "we then demonstrate the validity of assumptions of the effective fp dynamics for the cluster size and estimate the effective free energy surface as well as the rates of micelle breakup , in good agreement with full equilibrium mc simulation .",
    "we observe that the assumption of one - dimensional coarse dynamics breaks down for small cluster sizes and that , in order to successfully reconstruct the free energy surface , one needs to consider coarse - grained dynamics in at least a two - dimensional configuration space , where the second dimension can be chosen to be , e.g. , the cluster energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s : theo ] , we state some basic results of the theory of stochastic processes , which form theoretical basis of the coarse kinetic approach . in section [ s : equilibrium ] , we briefly review the lattice model and the monte carlo method used in our simulations .",
    "we also present results of a long - time equilibrium simulation , which will be compared with the kinetic approach results in the subsequent sections .",
    "section [ s : nonequil ] contains a detailed description of our implementation of the kinetic approach specific to simulations of micelle formation .",
    "results of the kinetic approach calculations are reported in section [ s : results ] . in this section",
    ", we also check assumptions underlying the effective fp equation model for the micelle formation dynamics and validate these assumptions computationally . in section [ s : multi_dim ] , we explore the micelle formation dynamics in the phase space parameterized by two coarse variables .",
    "we observe that , in most cases , the system quickly approaches an effective one - dimensional manifold -so that the one - dimensional fp model for the micelle formation dynamics is appropriate .",
    "we further observe that such a separation of timescales is much weaker for dynamics of small clusters . finally ,",
    "in section [ s : discussion ] , we summarize our findings and briefly discuss some other coarse - grained ,  equation - free \" methods ( coarse newton and coarse reverse integration ) and their application to the micelle formation problem .",
    "in this section we review some standard results from the theory of stochastic processes and discuss their role in the kinetic approach .",
    "it is assumed here that the system dynamics can be described by a single coarse variable ( reaction coordinate ) @xmath0 .",
    "this assumption implies that all other variables quickly approach some sort of slow , attracting , one - dimensional manifold ; that is , the statistics of the simulation quickly become functions of one observable ; the slow manifold is the graph of this function . in our case of micelle formation , @xmath1 is chosen to be the size of a micelle , as measured by the number of amphiphile molecules contained in the micelle and it is assumed that all other physical attributes of a micelle ( such as radii of gyration , density profile , energy , etc . ) are quickly slaved ( in an averaged sense ) to its size .",
    "it will be shown in section  [ s : multi_dim ] that this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "consider a general one - dimensional stochastic process @xmath0 .",
    "the evolution of the probability density @xmath2 of @xmath1 obeys the following integral equation @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the transition probability from point @xmath5 at time @xmath6 to point @xmath1 at time @xmath7 .",
    "the differential form of this equation , known as the kramers - moyal expansion , is as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the differential moments of the transition probability @xmath10 .",
    "the angular brackets here denote ensemble averaging and @xmath11 denotes a realization of the stochastic process with a @xmath12-function distribution at the starting point @xmath6 , @xmath13 .",
    "this is a very general result and it applies to any one - dimensional stochastic process .",
    "if the process is markovian and gaussian , then only the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kramers_moyal ] ) are non - zero . moreover , if the stochastic process is invariant with respect to the shift in time ( which is true for the processes without external time - dependent forcing ) , then the expansion coefficients @xmath14 are independent of time . hence , under these assumptions the stochastic process can be described by the fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath15 p(\\psi , t).\\ ] ] here , @xmath16 is the drift coefficient and @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient which are directly related to the _ short - scale _ evolution of the first two moments of @xmath1 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn_def ] ) .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the fokker - planck equation components ( the drift and the diffusion coefficient ) can be fully reconstructed from short - scale simulations .",
    "for our coarse - grained dynamics , we initialize the system consistently with some value of the coarse variable @xmath18 ( we call this procedure of constructing microscopic initial conditions consistent with the prescribed coarse variables as  lifting \" @xcite ) .",
    "then we perform a short - scale simulation and estimate the derivatives of the average and the standard deviation of the coarse variable , @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is a trajectory of the system that starts from @xmath21 at time @xmath22 , angular brackets denote averaging over different realizations of this trajectory , and @xmath23 is the variance of @xmath20 . hence , we can reconstruct a global pde from short - scale , appropriately initialized local simulations . in practice ( in this paper ) the derivatives contained in expressions ( [ eq : vd_def ] ) are computed by fitting a straight line to @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this procedure is discussed in more detail in section  [ s : nonequil ] ; clearly , better fitting techniques ( e.g. maximum likelihood estimation ) can be used .",
    "once the fokker - planck equation is reconstructed , one can calculate several global characteristics of the system , such as the effective free energy @xmath26 and the rates of transitions between different metastable states of the system .",
    "this effective free energy can be obtained from the equilibrium probability distribution @xmath27 which , in turn , is a solution of the steady - state fokker - planck equation @xmath28      \\peq(\\psi , t ) = 0.\\ ] ] by substituting the ansatz @xmath29 into the equation ( [ eq : sfp ] ) , we obtain @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the boltzmann factor and @xmath32 is the temperature of the system . note that , since the free energy is defined up to an additive constant , one can multiply @xmath33 in the logarithmic term by an arbitrary constant in order to preserve consistent units .",
    "the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) is significant if the noise is multiplicative .",
    "since this is a subtle point that can be overlooked if one uses other ( equivalent ) descriptions of the stochastic process , we here discuss it in more detail .",
    "let us first discuss the connection between the fokker - planck equation and the corresponding langevin equation descriptions .",
    "this point would become important if we tried to fit simulation data to a coarse - grained _ langevin _ description -rather than a coarse - grained fp description .    a langevin equation that corresponds to",
    "the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) is as follows : @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the friction coefficient , @xmath36 is the deterministic force , and @xmath37 is the stochastic force .",
    "the latter is a gaussian stochastic process with zero mean and with variance related to the damping coefficient @xmath38 by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath39    the relationship between @xmath36 and @xmath35 of the langevin equation and the drift and diffusion coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath33 of the fokker - planck equation depends on the interpretation of the white noise in the langevin equation ( [ eq : le ] ) as discussed in standard references ( see e.g. refs .  ) . if one uses it interpretation , then @xmath41 and , if one use the stratonovich interpretation , then @xmath42 both of these interpretations are identical in the case of additive noise ( i.e. when @xmath38 is a constant independ on @xmath1 ) . in the case of multiplicative noise (",
    "i.e. when @xmath38 is depends on @xmath1 ) , the situation becomes somewhat more complicated and , in particular , the force @xmath36 is not just a gradient of the free energy @xmath26 for both it and stratonovich interpretation .",
    "this can be confirmed by direct substitution and is discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "in particular , in the case of it interpretation , @xmath43 where @xmath44 it is clear that the expressions ( [ eq : g ] ) and ( [ eq : g0 ] ) are identical up to an additive constant _ only _ if the diffusion coefficient @xmath45 ( and hence the damping coefficient @xmath38 ) is constant . therefore , we compute the effective free energy using eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) .    despite the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq : g0 ] ) is an incorrect expression _ for the free energy _ , the quantity @xmath46 finds its use in calculations of transition rates .",
    "in fact , the mean residence time in a free energy well can be written as @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath1 is a point inside the well , @xmath18 is the boundary of the well .",
    "this expression is used in section  [ s : nonequil ] to compute the micelle ( computational ) disintegration rate .",
    "if the free energy barrier is sufficiently high , then transitions such as micelle formation and disintegration , can be described by first order kinetics and the transition rate @xmath48 is the inverse of the mean residence time @xmath49 .",
    "earlier work on such a kinetic approach @xcite has used the langevin equation description of the stochastic process .",
    "the information about the system dynamics was obtained from the time derivatives of @xmath24 and @xmath25 which , in turn , were obtained by fitting @xmath24 and @xmath25 to a straight line , just like for the fp equation description , see eqs ( [ eq : vd_def ] ) .",
    "therefore , the _ fitting _ procedure for the langevin equation model is the same as that for the fp equation model .",
    "however , if the diffusion coefficient is not constant , the _ interpretation _ of the fitting results for the langevin equation can lead to ambiguities since , in this case , one would have to specify an interpretation of the white noise ( it or stratonovich ) .",
    "we will bypass here the details of the estimation ( fitting ) of the data to a langevin description that arise from the interpretation dilemma , and use the fokker - planck description of the stochastic process which directly relates the fitted drift and diffusion coefficients to the statistical properties of the process .",
    "another popular description of a stochastic process is the smoluchowski equation @xmath50 p(\\psi , t),\\ ] ] which was originally derived from a fokker - planck equation for an inertial brownian particle in the limit of negligible inertia @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the smoluchowski equation is that @xmath51 is the  true \" effective force , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "however , @xmath51 of the smoluchowski equation , in general , is not proportional to the drift coefficient @xmath40 discussed earlier .",
    "in fact , some straightforward algebra shows that @xmath53 which is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "hence , the correction due to the position - dependent diffusion coefficient ( the second term in eq . (",
    "[ eq : g ] ) ) is present also in the smoluchowski equation .",
    "it will be shown in section  [ s : nonequil ] that this correction is significant in the case of the micelle formation , where the diffusion coefficient is significantly inhomogeneous .",
    "we study the micellization process using the lattice model for surfactant systems originally proposed by larson @xcite .",
    "panagiotopoulos and coworkers @xcite have performed extensive grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) simulations of this model in order to study micellization and phase transitions . despite its simplicity",
    ", this model yields predictions that are in good qualitative agreement with experimental data .    in this model ,",
    "an amphiphile molecule is represented as a chain of beads and a solvent molecule is represented as a single bead .",
    "the beads occupy sites on a cubic lattice and the connected beads of an amphiphile molecule are restricted to be in nearest - neighbor sites with bonds along the vectors @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and their reflections along the principal axis , resulting in a coordination number of 26 .",
    "there are two types of beads : hydrophobic tail ( t ) and hydrophilic head ( h ) and the solvent is modeled by head beads .",
    "the hydrophobic interaction is modeled by attractive interaction between tail beads .",
    "each bead interacts only with the 26 nearest neighbors and the total energy of the system is the sum of pairwise interactions between beads .",
    "the tail - tail interaction energy @xmath57 is -2 and the tail - head and head - head interaction energies @xmath58 and @xmath59 are zero , following ref .  .",
    "it is furthermore assumed that all sites that are not occupied by the amphiphile beads are occupied by the solvent .",
    "this assumption implies that there is no need to explicitly include solvent into the mc moves .    in most calculations presented in this paper ,",
    "the following mix of mc moves is used : 50% amphiphile transfers ( i.e. addition or removal ) , 49.5% amphiphile partial regrowth moves , and 0.5% cluster moves . in section [ s :",
    "mix ] , we perform simulations with several different mixes of mc moves in order to investigate the effects of different  dynamics \" on the kinetic approach results . since in this paper we apply a dynamic approach to equilibrium mc simulations , in order to simplify the notation , we refer to the number of mc move as the  time \" .",
    "let us emphasize once again that it is the _",
    "mc computational _ dynamics that we attemp to -in some sense- accelerate , and not _ physical _ dynamics ; when the base simulation is an md one ( as in ref . )",
    "then our approach would attempt to accelerate physical dynamics .",
    "the simulations are performed for an amphiphile chain h@xmath60t@xmath60 which consists of 4 head beads and 4 tail beads .",
    "the simulations are performed at temperature @xmath61 and chemical potential @xmath62 in a cubic box with a side length of 40 sites , assuming periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this box size is sufficient to prevent spurious effects of periodicity , since the typical diameter of a micelle is significantly smaller than half the size of the box side .",
    "we perform a reference long - time simulation of the system in order to compute the free energy and the rates of creation and destruction of micelles . in this simulation ,",
    "we consider 500 realizations of the system and compute the above quantities using data saved from 600 million mc steps after equilibration .",
    "the free energy curve @xmath63 is parameterized by the cluster size @xmath1 and is computed from the histogram of the cluster sizes .",
    "a cluster is defined as an aggregate of amphiphile molecules such that each molecule in a cluster has at least one tail bead which occupies a neighboring site with a tail bead from another amphiphile of the cluster . in other words ,",
    "each cluster molecule interacts through hydrophobic attraction with at least one other cluster molecule .",
    "the cluster size @xmath1 is defined as a number of amphiphiles in this cluster .",
    "the free energy @xmath64 obtained from these equilibrium calculations is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ f : g]a .",
    "@xmath64 has two minima : one at @xmath65 which corresponds to free amphiphiles and another one at @xmath66 , which corresponds to micelles .",
    "the free energy barrier separating these two states is located at @xmath67 .    in the calculations of equilibrium micelle formation / disintegration rates ,",
    "a transition between a small cluster and a micelle is said to occur when the cluster size crosses the free energy barrier @xmath68 .",
    "for the purposes of the equilibrium calculation , the precise definition of the border between micelles and smaller clusters is unimportant since the transition happens on the much faster timescale than the average lifetime of a micelle .",
    "the rate of micelle formation / disintegration or , in order words , of transition from a system containing @xmath69 micelles to a system containing @xmath70 micelles in a simulation box , is    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the average time between the transitions .",
    "( [ eq : kdef ] ) follows from the first order kinetics approximation , which is justified when the time between micelle birth / death has an exponential distribution .",
    "this assumption holds if the free energy barrier is sufficiently high ( which is true in the current case ) and , moreover , we have checked this assumption by direct calculation of the transition time distribution .",
    "we expect that the first order kinetics assumption will break down in denser systems , where the micelle coalescence becomes a dominant mechanism for altering size and number density of micelles .",
    "however , as discussed in paper i , the system under consideration ( h@xmath60t@xmath60 at @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) has low micelle density with an average of about 1 micelle per @xmath73 simulation box .    in the system considered here , there are no long - range energetic interactions between the micelles . however , we observe that , due to entropic interactions , the micelle birth and death rates vary depending on the number of micelles already present in the simulation box . in this work ,",
    "we focus on transitions @xmath74 and @xmath75 , i.e. birth and death of micelles in a simulation box that is otherwise filled only with small clusters .",
    "an extension to a general case of transitions @xmath76 is straightforward .",
    "in this section , we describe the details of the implementation of our kinetic approach for the computational micelle formation .",
    "as discussed in section [ s : theo ] , in order to compute the drift and diffusion coefficients , we perform short - time simulations initialized at a prescribed value @xmath18 of the coarse variable @xmath1 . in the case of micelle formation , @xmath1 is the number of amphiphile molecules contained in a micelle ( or a nucleus of a micelle ) .",
    "hence , in order to initialize the simulations , we place a cluster of a prescribed size @xmath18 into the simulation box .    in order to facilitate this process , we maintain a database of cluster structures . in the simulations reported here",
    ", the database is obtained from an equilibrium simulation by saving cluster structures every 100,000 mc steps . as will be shown in section  [ s : multi_dim ] , this frequency of the database updates assures that the saved structures are sufficiently different from each other .",
    "the database thus obtained contains equilibrium structures of clusters for some temperature @xmath32 and chemical potential @xmath77 . in the current paper , we consider the kinetic approach precisely for these values of @xmath32 and @xmath77 .",
    "however , it is very straightforward to generate a new cluster database from an existing one : it is only necessary to equilibrate the available cluster structures at new @xmath32 and @xmath77 ; we will estimate the ( relatively short ) time of this equilibration below .",
    "thus , the initial conditions for each simulation of the kinetic approach consist of a single cluster of size @xmath18 picked at random from the database and placed into an empty simulation box . the values of @xmath18 range from 1 to 90 and , for each @xmath18 , 3000 to 10,000 mc realizations are computed .",
    "in addition to the micelle ( or a nucleus ) which is explicitly placed into the system , the system always contains some  soup \" of single amphiphiles , dimers , and other small clusters . since we do not put these small clusters into the system explicitly , we let it equilibrate before computing statistics of the nucleus evolution .",
    "equilibration here means reaching a quasi - steady - state distribution of small clusters . in order to obtain the small clusters equilibration time ,",
    "we compute the evolution of average small cluster size and the first two moments of the distribution of the number of molecules contained in small clusters and conclude that these quantities reach their steady - state values within just 20,000 mc steps .",
    "we hence use the equilibration time of 20,000 mc steps or more in our simulations . in the non - equilibrium results reported below",
    ", time = 0 corresponds to the time at which the small clusters have equilibrated .",
    "since the nucleus size can change a little during the equilibration time ( due to addition / removal of amphiphiles to / from the nucleus ) , @xmath18 refers to the size of the cluster after the small cluster equilibration is complete .",
    "we will also discuss below the option of small cluster equilibration _ constrained _ on the cluster size ( in the spirit of umbrella sampling ) .",
    "the nucleus size @xmath0 is measured with some prescribed frequency @xmath78 and the center of mass of the nucleus is tracked in order to prevent possible confusion between a small  dying \" nucleus and an emerging small cluster .",
    "we have performed two series of mc simulations :    1",
    ".   long simulations : length of production run = @xmath79 steps ; frequency of output @xmath80 steps ; equilibration time before production run = @xmath81 steps .",
    "short simulations : length of production run = @xmath82 steps ; frequency of output @xmath83 steps ; equilibration time before production run = @xmath82 steps .",
    "the long simulations have been performed in order to study slower dynamics of ( almost ) formed micelles inside the free energy well ; the short simulations have been performed in order to study faster dynamics near the free energy barrier as well as to explore the dynamics of the additional coarse variables ( see sections [ s : results ] and [ s : multi_dim ] ) .",
    "we observe that results of both simulations agree for the fast dynamics near the barrier but the shorter simulations fail to provide sufficient information to correctly reconstruct the free energy surface corresponding to slower dynamics near the free energy minimum .",
    "we hence report the free energy and the diffusion coefficient obtained from the longer simulations .    from the mc results , we compute @xmath84 and @xmath85 and obtain the time derivatives of these quantities by fitting a straight line to them .",
    "an example of obtained @xmath84 and @xmath85 together with the fitted lines is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : poly_fit ] .",
    "the fitting is performed for @xmath86 $ ] , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are cut - off times , whose choice is motivated by the following considerations .",
    "the evolution for @xmath89 is neglected , since it corresponds to  healing \" the details of our particular initialization as we approach the one - dimensional manifold parameterized by @xmath1 .",
    "the one - dimensional coarse - grained description for @xmath24 becomes a valid approximation after some initial time has elapsed , i.e. beyond @xmath87 .",
    "the cut - off time @xmath87 was chosen by a visual inspection of the plots and its precise choice does not influence the results .",
    "the relation of the multi - dimensional dynamics to @xmath87 will be discussed in more detail in section  [ s : multi_dim ] .",
    "the upper cut - off time @xmath88 , corresponding to the evolution of the initial @xmath12-function density becoming non - gaussian , can be justified as follows .",
    "if the initial cluster size @xmath18 is sufficiently small , then a significant fraction of mc realizations will result in a complete disintegration of the nucleus into a collection of unconnected single amphiphiles .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : hist ] , which shows an evolution of the distribution of the cluster size .",
    "initially , this is a @xmath12-function distribution .",
    "at some intermediate time , this is still well approximated by a gaussian distribution ; we have not yet started to sample the nonlinearities of the effective free energy away from the nominal initial point . at some later time ,",
    "when a significant fraction of clusters has disintegrated , the distribution starts becoming bimodal .",
    "this bimodality of the distribution is echoed in a nonlinear ( in time ) behavior of both @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we hence choose the upper cut - off time @xmath88 as the time at which the height of the second mode is 5% the height of the gaussian mode .",
    "we observe that the introduction of the upper cut - off time @xmath88 is necessary only for relatively small clusters ( @xmath90 ) . for larger clusters",
    ", @xmath88 is much larger than the simulation time because disintegration of a micelle into small clusters is an extremely slow process , and the simulation does not leave the neighborhood of the bottom of the micelle well .",
    "the effective free energy @xmath26 obtained from the kinetic approach is compared to the free energy @xmath64 obtained from the full - scale equilibrium simulations in fig .  [",
    "we observe good agreement between the two estimates of the free energy for the values of @xmath1 located on the right of the free energy barrier .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath26 and @xmath64 becomes significant of the left of the barrier . as will be discussed in section  [ s : multi_dim ] , we believe that this discrepancy is due to the fact that the dynamics for these small @xmath1 is effectively multi - dimensional , i.e. the timescale of the approach to the one - dimensional manifold is comparable to the timescale of motion along that manifold .    the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath33 , shown in fig .",
    "[ f : g]b , exhibits strong position dependence near the free energy barrier .",
    "this suggests importance of the correction to the free energy due to multiplicative noise ( see the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) ) . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ f : g]a we show for comparison the free energy @xmath46 obtained from expression ( [ eq : g0 ] ) , which neglects the multiplicative nature of the noise .",
    "it is clear that the discrepancy between @xmath46 and @xmath64 is significant in the barrier region , precisely in the region of strong position dependence of @xmath33 .",
    "drift and diffusion coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath33 , obtained from the kinetic approach calculations , can be used to obtain the _ computational _ disintegration rates of micelles . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean_res ] ) , we compute the micelle disintegration rate to be @xmath91 .",
    "this compares reasonably well with the micelle disintegration rate of @xmath92 obtained from the full - scale mc simulations ( see section  [ s : equilibrium ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy is partly due to the discrepancy in free energies on the left of the saddle point ( see fig .  [",
    "f : g]a ) . in fact , if we compute the disintegration rate using the free energy obtained from the equilibrium simulation and the diffusion coefficient obtained from the kinetic approach calculations , we obtain the rate @xmath93 , in a better agreement with the equilibrium result .",
    "calculation of the micelle _ formation _ rate is somewhat more complicated because in this case one needs to examine dynamics of very small nuclei , which can not be described by our one - dimensional fokker - planck equation parametrized by micelle size .",
    "in fact , a small nucleus is indistinguishable from other small clusters in the simulation box .",

    ", it is required to have a reliable fp equation description of the cluster size evolution in the range of @xmath1 where the matching is expected to take place .",
    "however , currently we observe a discrepancy between the equilibrium simulations and the kinetically fitted single coarse variable fokker - planck equation on the left of the free energy barrier @xmath68 , which is evidenced , e.g. by different slopes of @xmath64 and @xmath26 on the left of @xmath68 ( see fig .

    "however , the effective fokker - planck equation description on the left of @xmath68 can be improved if one goes beyond the one - dimensional coarse variable model , as discussed in section  [ s : multi_dim ] .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss several assumptions behind the effective fp equation dynamics and demonstrate computationally that these assumptions hold in the case of our gcmc simulations of micelle formation .",
    "one of the assumptions implicit in the fp model is that the cluster size @xmath1 changes gradually , i.e. removal ( addition ) of single amphiphiles ( or , possibly di- and tri - mers ) from ( to ) the nucleus is far more probable than spontaneous break up of a nucleus into several clusters of comparable size ( spontaneous assembly of clusters into a nucleus ) . in order to check this assumption , we compute the probability @xmath97 of removal ( addition ) of a cluster of size @xmath98 from ( to ) the nucleus of size @xmath1 .",
    "we observe that , for all nuclei sizes , removal / addition of a single amphiphile has a probability greater than 0.9 and the probabilities of removal / addition of larger clusters decrease monotonically with the cluster size . in fig .",
    "[ f : brate_prob ] , we show the probability @xmath97 for the nucleus size @xmath99 .",
    "such probability distributions are almost identical for all nucleus sizes @xmath100 and hence , the assumption of the gradual change of the size of the nucleus is valid .",
    "another assumption of the fp equation is that the process is markovian .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to the assumption ( [ eq : fdt ] ) of the zero - correlation time of the stochastic force in the langevin equation ( [ eq : le ] ) .",
    "from the langevin equation , it follows that the correlation time of noise coincides with that of @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the fluctuation of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the correlation time of @xmath103 , we compute the autocorrelation function @xmath101 .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath104 is estimated using the forward differences , @xmath105 where @xmath78 is the frequency of output in our simulations . in the calculations of the autocorrelation functions",
    "we have used results of the shorter mc simulation with more frequent output ( see section [ s : nonequil ] ) and hence @xmath78 = 100 mc steps . a normalized autocorrelation function of @xmath104 ( and , hence , of @xmath103 ) for the initial nucleus size @xmath106",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : autocorr ] and is typical for all @xmath107 .",
    "it is clear that approximating the effective stochastic practically by white noise is a good assumption .",
    "hence , the evolution of the nucleus size can be modelled by the effective fokker - planck equation .",
    "another important question that needs to be addressed is whether the cluster database has a sufficient number of cluster structures in order to provide statistically accurate initial conditions for the kinetic approach simulations .",
    "this question is especially pertinent near the free energy barrier .",
    "recall that the cluster database is obtained from the equilibrium run and the clusters are saved every 100,000 mc steps . since the probability to observe a cluster near the barrier is very low , there is a big difference in the number of the available cluster structures at the barrier and in the free energy well .",
    "the database used in most of our calculations was obtained from 500 realizations of 5 million mc steps and , although there are hundreds of entries for ( almost ) equilibrium micelles in the free energy well , there is as little as 3 database entries for some cluster sizes near the barrier . in order to check",
    "if this small number of initial configurations introduces a bias into the kinetic approach simulations , we have added more structures to the database by running equilibrium mc simulations for additional 45 million mc steps . in this larger database ,",
    "the smallest number of database entries is 118 .",
    "we have repeated the calculations with this enlarged database and obtained the same @xmath26 and @xmath35 as we did with the smaller database .",
    "hence , the kinetic approach calculations are accurate even for small number of database entries .",
    "this happens because , even if initially we place the same nucleus into several copies of the simulation box , during the equilibration time these nuclei will evolve into statistically different structures .",
    "the timescales of change of the cluster structures , as well as biasing the equilibration by constraining the nucleus size will be discussed in section  [ s : multi_dim ] .",
    "since mc simulations do not reflect the real physical dynamics and the choice of mc moves is somewhat arbitrary , the kinetic properties obtained from mc simulations ( such as rates of micelle formation and disintegration ) are expected to change as we change the mc rules . however",
    ", if the fokker - planck model is valid for the mc  dynamics \" , the equilibrium properties ( such as the free energy ) , obtained from the kinetic approach should not be affected by the change of the mc rules .    in order to confirm this",
    ", we perform mc simulations using 9 different mixes of mc moves , which we call mix 0 , ... , mix 8 ( mix 0 corresponds to the simulations reported in the preceding sections ) .",
    "probabilities of different mc moves in these mixes are listed in table  [ t : mix ] .",
    "the acceptance / rejection ratios for mc moves in all simulations are observed to be identical .",
    "the simulations are performed near the free energy barrier , with the initial nucleus size @xmath18 ranging from 10 to 40 . as expected , the  dynamics \" is different for different mixes of mc moves . this can be seen e.g. in fig .",
    "[ f : mix78 ] which compares evolutions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 computed from the simulations with rules mix 7 and mix 8 .",

    "[ f : mix ] .",
    "this agreement becomes somewhat worse on the left of the free energy barrier @xmath68 .",
    "the obtained results thus confirm that the fokker - planck model provides an adequate description for the  dynamics \" of mc simulations of the micelle growth and decay .",
    "in the previous sections , we have discussed monte carlo  dynamics \" of micelle formation assuming that the system can be accurately modeled by a single coarse variable , namely , the aggregation number @xmath1 of a cluster .",
    "the aggregation number provides sufficient information about a micelle at equilibrium .",
    "in fact , one can reconstruct the thermodynamic properties of an equilibrium micelle of a given aggregation number using a mean - field theory @xcite .",

    ", we explore the  evolution \" of cluster structures and consider  dynamics \" in a two - dimensional @xmath108 space , where @xmath109 is the cluster energy .",
    "this variable is a useful probe of the cluster structure because if reflects how tightly the cluster is packed : the smaller the energy , the more hydrophobic groups are in contact .",
    "we note that one can choose a different variable ( e.g. , a radius of gyration ) to reflect the cluster structure . however , the specific choice of the second coarse variable is not important : if the coarse - grained cluster dynamics are successfully parameterized by two variables , then all other variables in our simulation become quickly slaved to the chosen two coarse variables .",
    "it is more convenient to consider dynamics of the normalized cluster energy @xmath110 .",

    "the equilibrium micelles correspond to a stable node at @xmath66 and the free energy barrier corresponds to a saddle point at @xmath116 .",
    "the two - dimensional dynamics provides a clear explanation for the nonlinear behavior of @xmath117 and @xmath25 for @xmath89 ( see fig .",

    "[ f : slopes2d ] we plot several typical trajectories from the complete phase portrait of fig .

    "we emphasize that @xmath87 is not the equilibration time since the clusters are already equilibrated prior to computing the averages .",

    "an order of magnitude separation of timescales appears thus to prevail between the motion _ towards _ and that _ along _ the one - dimensional slow manifold .",

    "the timescale of approaching the one - dimensional manifold provides a useful measure of how often the cluster database should be updated in order for the saved cluster structures to be sufficiently different .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that within the time the coarse variables @xmath1 and @xmath109 have reached the manifold , the corresponding cluster structure is significantly changed . from the eigenvalue analysis presented above ,",
    "it follows that the timescale of approaching the manifold is on the order of @xmath144 mc steps .",
    "hence , the frequency of the database updates used in our simulations ( @xmath145 steps ) , ensures that the saved structures are sufficiently different .",
    "moreover , this explains why simulations with a small database produce results almost identical to those of simulations with a larger database ( see section  [ s : database_quality ] ) : the equilibration time of @xmath146 ( for small clusters ) and @xmath81 ( for larger clusters ) is sufficient to significantly alter the nucleus structure and thus to provide good sampling even if one uses a small database .",

    "we have demonstrated that the monte carlo  dynamics \" of micelle formation for the larson model can be successfully described by an effective fokker - planck equation , and that the drift and diffusion coefficients of this equation can be obtained from short - scale , appropriately initialized  kinetic \" simulations . due to separation of timescales between the aggregation number @xmath1 of a micelle nucleus and the coarse variables reflecting the nucleus structure ( such as the nucleus energy @xmath109 ) , the coarse - grained micelle formation process can be successfully approximated by motion on a one - dimensional manifold parameterized by the coarse variable @xmath1 .",
