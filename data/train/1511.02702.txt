    "as usual , we will say that @xmath11 is a convex body if @xmath1 is a convex , compact subset of @xmath8 equal to the closure of its interior .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is origin - symmetric if @xmath12 , where @xmath13 for @xmath14 . for a set @xmath1",
    "we denote by dim@xmath15 its dimension , that is , the dimension of the affine hull of @xmath1 .",
    "we define @xmath16 to be the minkowski sum of @xmath17 .",
    "we will also denote by @xmath18 the @xmath4-dimensional hausdorff measure , and if the body @xmath1 is @xmath4-dimensional we will call @xmath19 the volume of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , let us denote by @xmath20 a hyperplane perpendicular to a unit vector @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 we refer to @xcite for general definitions and properties of convex bodies .",
    "the slicing problem of bourgain @xcite is , undoubtedly , one of the major open problems in convex geometry asking if a convex , origin - symmetric body of volume one must have a large ( in volume ) hyperplane section .",
    "more precisely , it asks whether there exists an absolute constant @xmath23 so that for any origin - symmetric convex body @xmath1 in @xmath8 @xmath24 the problem is still open , with the best - to - date estimate of @xmath25 established by klartag @xcite , who improved the previous estimate of bourgain @xcite , we refer to @xcite and @xcite for detailed information and history of the problem .",
    "recently , alexander koldobsky proposed an interesting generalization of the slicing problem @xcite : does there exists an absolute constant @xmath26 so that for every even measure @xmath27 on @xmath8 , with a positive density , and for every origin - symmetric convex body @xmath1 in @xmath8 such that @xmath28 koldobsky was able to solve the above question for a number of special cases of the body @xmath1 and provide a general estimate of @xmath29 .",
    "the most amazing fact here is that the constant @xmath26 in ( [ eq : cont ] ) can be chosen independent of the measure @xmath27 under the assumption that @xmath27 has even positive density .",
    "in addition , koldobsky and the second named author were able to prove in @xcite that @xmath26 is of order @xmath30 if one assumes that the measure @xmath27 is @xmath31-concave .",
    "we note that the assumption of positive density is essential for the above results and ( [ eq : cont ] ) is simply not true if this condition is dropped . indeed , to create a counterexample consider an even measure @xmath27 on @xmath32 uniformly distributed over @xmath33 points on the unit circle ,",
    "then the constant @xmath26 in ( [ eq : cont ] ) will depend on @xmath34 .    during the 2013 aim workshop on `` sections of convex bodies '' koldobsky asked",
    "if it is possible to provide a discrete analog of inequality ( [ eq : cont ] ) : let @xmath35 be the standard integer lattice in @xmath8 , @xmath1 be a convex , origin - symmetric body , define @xmath36 , the number of points of @xmath35 in @xmath1 .",
    "1em * question : * _ does there exist a constant @xmath37 such that _ @xmath38 _ for all convex origin - symmetric bodies @xmath11 containing @xmath4 linearly independent lattice points ? _",
    "1em we note here that we require that @xmath1 contains @xmath4 linearly independent lattice points , i.e. , @xmath39 , in order to eliminate the degenerate case of a body ( for example , take a box @xmath40^{d-1}\\times [ -20 , 20]$ ] ) whose maximal section contains all lattice points in the body , but whose volume may be taken to 0 by eliminating a dimension .",
    "koldobsky s question is yet another example of an attempt to translate questions and facts from classical convexity to more general settings including discrete geometry .",
    "the properties of sections of convex bodies with respect to the integer lattice were extensively studied in discrete tomography @xcite , where many interesting new properties were proved and a series of exciting open questions were proposed .",
    "it is interesting to note that after translation many questions become quite non - trivial and counterintuitive , and the answer may be quite different from the continuous case .",
    "in addition , finding the relation between the geometry of a convex set and the number of integer points contained in the set is always a non - trivial task .",
    "one can see this , for example , from the history of khinchin s flatness theorem @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study koldobsky s question . in section 2",
    "we will show the solution for the @xmath41-dimensional case .",
    "the solution is based on the classical minkowski s first and pick s theorems from the geometry of numbers and gives a general idea of the approach to be used in sections 3 and 4 . in section 3",
    "we apply a discrete version of the theorem of f. john due to t. tao and v. vu @xcite to give a partial answer to koldobsky s question and show that the constant @xmath37 can be chosen independent of the body @xmath1 and as small as @xmath42 .",
    "we start section 4 with a case of unconditional bodies and present a simple proof that in this case @xmath37 can be chosen of order @xmath43 which is best possible .",
    "after , we prove the discrete analog of brunn s theorem and use it to show that the constant @xmath37 , for the general case , can be chosen as small as @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , we prove the slightly more general result that @xmath45 where the maximum is taken over all @xmath7-dimensional linear subspaces @xmath46 .",
    "finally , we also provide a short observation that @xmath47 .    * acknowledgment * : we are indebted to alexander koldobsky and fedor nazarov for valuable discussions .",
    "let us start with recalling two classical statements in the geometry of numbers ( see @xcite , theorem 3.28 pg 134 and @xcite , theorem 2.8 pg 38 ) :    [ th : m1 ] ( minkowski s first theorem ) let @xmath5 be an origin - symmetric convex body such that @xmath49 then @xmath1 contains at least one non - zero element of @xmath35 .",
    "( pick s theorem ) let @xmath50 be an integral @xmath41-dimensional convex polygon , then @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the area of the polygon , @xmath53 is the number of lattice points in the interior of @xmath50 , and @xmath54 is the number of lattice points on the boundary .    here",
    "a polygon is called integral if it can be described as the convex hull of lattice points .",
    "now we will use the above theorems to show that the constant @xmath37 in koldobsky s question can be chosen independently of a convex , origin - symmetric body in @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a convex origin - symmetric body in @xmath32 , @xmath55 , then @xmath56    * proof : * let @xmath57 , then by minkowski s theorem , since @xmath58 , there exists a non - zero vector @xmath59 .",
    "then @xmath60 and @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the integer part of @xmath31 , and @xmath63 is the line containing @xmath64 and the origin .",
    "next , consider @xmath65 , i.e. , the convex hull of the integral points inside @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath50 is an integral @xmath41-dimensional convex polytope , and so by pick s theorem we get that @xmath66 using that @xmath67 .",
    "thus @xmath68 since the minmal volume of an origin - symmetric integral convex polygon is at least 2 .",
    "we now have that @xmath69",
    "it is a standard technique to get a first estimate in slicing inequalities , i.e. @xmath70 , by using the classical f. john theorem , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , which claims that for every convex origin - symmetric body @xmath11 there exists an ellipsoid @xmath71 such that @xmath72 . in this section",
    "we will use a recent discrete version of f. john s theorem , proved by t. tao and v. vu ( see @xcite ) to prove that the constant @xmath37 in koldobsky s question can be chosen independent of the origin - symmetric convex body @xmath11 .",
    "we first recall the definition of a generalized arithmetic progression ( see @xcite for more details ) :    let @xmath73 be an additive group , @xmath74 an @xmath4-tuple of non - negative integers and @xmath75 .",
    "then a generalized symmetric arithmetic progression @xmath76 is a triplet @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , define @xmath78 \\cdot { { \\boldsymbol v}}= \\left\\{n_1 { { \\boldsymbol v}}_1 + \\ldots + n_d { { \\boldsymbol v}}_d : n_j \\in [ -n_j , n_j ] \\cap",
    "\\zz   \\text { for all } 1\\leq j \\leq d \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the progression is called proper if the map @xmath79 is injective , @xmath80 is called its basis vectors , and @xmath4 its rank .",
    "[ def : progression ]    below is a version for @xmath35 of the discrete john theorem from @xcite ( theorem 1.6 there ) :    [ th : dj ] let @xmath1 be a convex origin - symmetric body in @xmath8 .",

    "thus @xmath93 next we consider the case @xmath94 . without loss of generality ,",
    "take @xmath95 , then define @xmath96 .",
    "application of ( [ eq : size ] ) gives @xmath97 where the last inequality follows from the minimality of @xmath98 and we use ( [ eq : incl ] ) to claim that @xmath99 now we consider the volume covered by our progression .",
    "take a fundamental parallelepiped @xmath100 let @xmath101\\cdot { { \\boldsymbol v}}$ ] , we notice that @xmath102 indeed from @xmath103 we get that the vertices of @xmath104 belong to @xmath105 for all @xmath106 and thus , by convexity , @xmath107 for all @xmath106 .",
    "next @xmath108 where the last inequality follows from the fact that @xmath109 are independent vectors in @xmath35 and thus @xmath110 .    finally , @xmath111",
    "the goal of this section is to improve the estimate provided in section 3 .",
    "we will need to consider counting points intersecting a body with a general lattice , and so we will adapt our notation slightly .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the general facts and introduction on the properties of the cardinality of intersections of convex bodies and a lattice .",
    "given a lattice @xmath112 we will take @xmath113 and , as before , if the lattice is omitted we will take the lattice to be the standard integer lattice of appropriate dimension .",
    "we begin with the statement of minkowski s second theorem which is an extension of minkowski s first theorem ( theorem [ th : m1 ] above ) and can be found , for example , in @xcite ( theorem 1.2 ) or @xcite ( theorem 3.30 pg 135 ) .",
    "first we recall the definition of successive minima .",
    "note , that it follows directly from the definition that @xmath117 .",
    "in addition , the assumption that @xmath1 contains @xmath4 linearly independent lattice points of @xmath112 implies that @xmath112 has rank @xmath4 and that @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , according to the definition of the successive minima there exists a set of linearly independent vectors from @xmath112 , @xmath119 , such that @xmath120 lies on the boundary of @xmath121 but the interior of @xmath122 does not contain any lattice vectors outside the span of @xmath123 .",
    "the vectors @xmath124 are called a directional basis , and we note that they may not necessarily form a basis of @xmath112 .",
    "next we will study the behavior of constant @xmath37 in the case of unconditional convex bodies .",
    "a set @xmath11 is said to be unconditional if it is symmetric with respect to any coordinate hyperplane , i.e. , @xmath127 , for any @xmath128 and any choice of @xmath129 signs .",
    "* proof : * this result follows from the simple observation that the section of @xmath1 by a coordinate hyperplane @xmath133 is maximal in cardinality among all parallel sections of @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath134 we can see this by considering a point @xmath135 .",
    "let @xmath136 be the reflection of @xmath137 over @xmath133 , i.e. , @xmath138 .",
    "using unconditionality of @xmath1 , we get that @xmath139 and convexity gives us @xmath140 .",
    "hence , the projection of a point in @xmath141 is associated to a point in @xmath142 , which explains ( [ eq : uncon ] ) .",

    "we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath146 corresponds to @xmath147 .",
    "so @xmath148 and @xmath149",
    ". thus @xmath150 , where , as before , @xmath151 is a line containing @xmath147 and the origin . using ( [ eq : uncon ] ) , we get @xmath152 by assumption we have @xmath153 and , using @xmath154 , for all @xmath155 , we get @xmath156 finally we use theorem [ th : m2 ] to finish the proof : @xmath157 the cross - polytope @xmath158 of @xmath159 shows that the bound is optimal up to multiplication with constants .    the idea of the proof of the above theorem follows from the classical brunn s theorem : the central hyperplane section of a convex origin - symmetric body is maximal in volume among all parallel sections ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one may notice that , in general , it may not be the case that the maximal hyperplane in cardinality for an origin - symmetric convex body passes through the origin . indeed , see figure 1 below , or consider an example of a cross - polytope @xmath160 , then @xmath161 but a face of @xmath162 contains @xmath4 integer points .",
