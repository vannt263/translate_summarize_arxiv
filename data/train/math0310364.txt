    "a geometrically finite hyperbolic surface is a topologically finite , complete riemannian surface of constant curvature -1 . in this paper",
    "we study the selberg zeta function , @xmath1 ( see  [ zeta.sec ] for the definition ) , associated to the length spectrum of a geometrically finite surface @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath2 has infinite area , the discrete spectrum of the positive laplacian @xmath3 will be finite and possibly empty .",
    "the appropriate spectral invariants at this level of generality are the _ scattering resonances _ or simply _ resonances_. these are the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent @xmath4 , with multiplicities ( see  [ scatt.sec ] for the definition ) .",
    "building upon our previous results and the work of guillop and zworski @xcite , we exhibit an explicit connection ( theorem [ thm.zeta2 ] ) between selberg s zeta function and a hadamard product over the resonance set .",
    "this yields the following :    [ thm.zeta ] let @xmath5 denote the number of cusps of @xmath2 , and let @xmath6 denote the euler characteristic of @xmath2 .",
    "the selberg zeta function @xmath7 extends to a meromorphic function of order two , with a divisor that can be divided into spectral and topological components : the spectral zeros of @xmath8 are given by the resonance set @xmath9 ( with multiplicities ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath1 has topological zeros at @xmath10 for @xmath11 , of order @xmath12 , and topological poles of order @xmath5 at @xmath13 .    in the full geometrically finite context",
    ", the meromorphic continuation of @xmath7 to @xmath14 was proven by guillop @xcite . if @xmath2 has finite area , then meromorphic continuation with the order bound and divisor as given here can be deduced from the selberg trace formula ( see @xcite ) . in the convex co - compact case ( @xmath15 )",
    "patterson - perry @xcite established the order bound , using thermodynamic formalism of ruelle and fried , and also computed the divisor .",
    "the thermodynamic formalism does not extend to the case @xmath16 . to prove that theorem [ thm.zeta ] holds for all geometrically finite @xmath2 requires a different approach from these previous results .",
    "as in the compact case , one can exploit knowledge of the divisor of the zeta function to link the resonance set to the length spectrum .",
    "[ cor.finite.euler ] the resonance set determines the length spectrum of @xmath2 , the euler characteristic , @xmath6 , and the number of cusps , @xmath5 .",
    "the length spectrum determines @xmath6 and @xmath5 up to a finite number of possibilities .",
    "the length spectrum , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 , together determine the resonance set .",
    "at present , we do not know whether the length spectrum ( by way of @xmath8 ) determines @xmath6 and @xmath5 when @xmath2 has infinite area and @xmath17 .",
    "that is , we can not rule out the possibility that the resonance set contributes to the multiplicity of each of the zeros of @xmath8 that lie in @xmath18 .",
    "however , if @xmath2 has finite area , the resonances are confined to a vertical strip , and hence for sufficiently negative @xmath19 , the multiplicity of the zero of @xmath8 equals @xmath12 . and in the convex co - compact case ( infinite area with no cusps ) , martin olbrich has pointed out to us that corollary 6.9 of @xcite , in conjunction with the theory of @xcite , shows that the multiplicity of resonances at @xmath20 is either zero ( for non - elementary groups ) or two ( for elementary groups ) .",
    "thus , in the convex co - compact case @xmath6 can be recovered as @xmath21 for any @xmath22 .    by combining corollary [ cor.finite.euler ] with methods of teichmller theory",
    "we obtain the following application :    [ finiteness ] let @xmath2 be a complete , geometrically finite hyperbolic surface of infinite area .",
    "then the length spectrum of @xmath2 determines @xmath2 up to finitely many possibilities .",
    "in particular , the resonance set determines @xmath2 up to finitely many possibilities .",
    "our proof of the first claim in theorem [ finiteness ] requires theorem [ thm.zeta ] .",
    "indeed , we do not know how to obtain bounds on the euler characteristic without using scattering theory .    if @xmath2 is connected , then there exists a finitely generated , torsion free , discrete subgroup , @xmath23 , of @xmath0 , unique up to conjugation , such that @xmath2 is the quotient of the hyperbolic upper half - plane , @xmath24 , by @xmath23 acting as mbius transformations .",
    "conversely , any such quotient is a geometrically finite hyperbolic surface .",
    "moreover , the length spectrum of @xmath2 equals ( twice ) the set @xmath25 ( including multiplicities ) .",
    "thus , from theorem [ finiteness ] we have    [ discrete ] let @xmath23 be a finitely generated , torsion - free , discrete subgroup of @xmath0 of co - infinite area",
    ". then the set of traces @xmath26 ( including multiplicities ) determines the conjugacy class of @xmath23 up to finitely many possibilities .",
    "theorem [ finiteness ] is due to mckean @xcite in the case that @xmath2 is compact and to mller @xcite in the case that @xmath2 has finite area .",
    "corollary [ discrete ] is also due to mckean @xcite in the case that @xmath23 is cocompact .",
    "theorem [ thm.zeta ] is proven by linking the zeta function to the scattering theory of @xmath27 .",
    "for geometrically finite @xmath2 scattering theory can be set up ( following the approach of guillop and zworski @xcite ) using a decomposition of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a compact surface , each @xmath30 , @xmath31 , is a funnel , and each @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a cusp ( end ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ gfsurface ] .",
    "( for an exact description of funnels and cusps , see  [ sec.model ] . )",
    "the boundary of @xmath29 consists of @xmath34 closed geodesics ( uniquely determined ) and @xmath35 horocycles ( the choice of which is not unique ) along which @xmath29 is glued to the funnel and cusp ends , respectively . the ideal boundary @xmath36 is the disjoint union of @xmath5 ideal points and @xmath37 circles .",
    "[ gfsurface ]    ]    the scattering operator @xmath38 , described in greater detail in  [ scatt.sec ] , can be viewed as a map from @xmath39 to itself , where a `` smooth function '' on @xmath36 is interpreted as an element of @xmath40 . because the funnels are isometric to standard models ( see  [ sec.model ] )",
    ", one can define relative scattering from the disjoint union @xmath41 to @xmath2 . on each funnel end",
    ", the laplacian @xmath42 carries dirichlet boundary conditions on the closed geodesic which joins @xmath43 to @xmath29 .",
    "the scattering operator for @xmath44 , denoted @xmath45 , is a direct sum of scattering operators for the dirichlet laplacians @xmath42 , and acts on @xmath46 .",
    "if we set @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 is the identity map on @xmath14 ) then @xmath49 acts on @xmath50 and the relative scattering operator @xmath51 is determinant class .",
    "thus one has a relative scattering determinant : @xmath52    in @xcite , guillop and zworski show that @xmath53 extends to the quotient of analytic functions of order at most four and compute its divisor in terms of the resonance set .",
    "our proof of theorem [ thm.zeta ] in  [ zeta.sec ] involves establishing the connection between @xmath1 and @xmath54 , and then exploiting this information about @xmath54 .",
    "in the course of the proof we will improve the order bound on @xmath54 from four to two .    * acknowledgments*. we are grateful to reza chamanara and jeffrey mcgowan for helpful conversations , and to martin olbrich for point out to us his results in @xcite .",
    "we also thank peter sarnak for encouraging us to remove the unnecessary geometric assumptions used in @xcite .",
    "we start with @xmath2 a geometrically finite hyperbolic surface decomposed into a compact core @xmath29 plus cusps @xmath55 and funnels @xmath56 as in ( [ zcf.decomp ] ) .",
    "the cusp and funnel ends are isometric to standard models which we now describe . here and in what follows , we use the upper half - plane model of hyperbolic space : @xmath57 , with metric @xmath58    for @xmath59 , denote by @xmath60 the abelian discrete group generated by the hyperbolic isometry @xmath61 .",
    "the quotient @xmath62 is the _ hyperbolic cylinder _ with a single primitive closed geodesic of length @xmath63 .",
    "it is well - known and easy to see that this cylinder is isometric to @xmath64 equipped with the metric @xmath65 a _ funnel _ is the subspace @xmath66 equipped with this metric . in particular , the boundary , @xmath67 , of @xmath68 is a geodesic of length @xmath63 .",

    "a level curve of the coordinate @xmath75 is called a _",
    "horocycle_. in particular , a cusp end is bounded by a horocycle of @xmath76 .",
    "note that in the decomposition of ( [ zcf.decomp ] ) the parameter @xmath77 can be chosen to be @xmath78 independent of the surface .",
    "this follows from a collar type lemma for cusps to be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "we ll regularize integrals over @xmath2 by introducing a ` defining function ' @xmath79 for the boundary at infinity , namely , choose @xmath80 so that in each of the cusp and funnel ends @xmath81 with respect to the geodesic coordinate systems introduced above . with this choice we can define a regularized integral :",
    "suppose @xmath82 is _ polyhomogeneous _ in @xmath79 , meaning that it has an asymptotic expansion as @xmath83 in powers of @xmath79 and @xmath84 , with smooth coefficients .",
    "we then define @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the finite part , meaning that the limit is taken after the divergent terms in the asymptotic expansion as @xmath87 are subtracted off .",
    "the 0-volume of a region is correspondingly defined as the 0-integral of @xmath88 .",
    "these regularizations would depend on the choice of @xmath79 in general .",

    "hence @xmath93 and the result follows from the gauss - bonnet theorem , since the funnels have geodesic boundary .    for a smoothing operator @xmath94 defined on @xmath95 , with continuous kernel @xmath96 with respect to riemannian measure on @xmath2 , the @xmath78-trace of @xmath94 is defined by @xmath97 for this to be well - defined , the function @xmath98 must be polyhomogeneous as a function of @xmath79 , which will be the case for the operators we consider .    there are two regularized traces formed from the resolvent that will be our main tools in this paper .",
    "let @xmath99 denote the green s function ( the integral kernel of the resolvent operator @xmath100 ) .",
    "one way to cancel the kernel s singularity on the diagonal so as to produce a trace is to subtract off the green s function for the model hyperbolic space , which has the same diagonal singularity .",

    "this function is known to be polyhomogeneous in @xmath79 by the general theory of @xcite . or , more directly",
