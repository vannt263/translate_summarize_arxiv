    "given recent advances in experimental quantum computation , where few - qubit systems have been realized  @xcite , a considerable amount of research is currently devoted to investigating larger - scale systems such as networks for quantum communication  @xcite . in such systems , where information must be coherently transported over long distances , photons are suitable candidates as quantum information carriers because of their long coherence times .",
    "solid - state devices , on the other hand , seem preferable for storage of quantum information  @xcite .",
    "essential components in any quantum communication toolbox are , thus , devices capable of directing photons through different channels  @xcite .",
    "these devices include single - photon transistors  @xcite , switches or routers  @xcite , single - photon beam splitters  @xcite , etc .",
    "so far , several approaches have been proposed   for building a quantum switch , such as an optical implementation using polarized photons and trapped atoms or a phase gate implementation  @xcite .",
    "also , proposals for a beam splitter based on superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) to route photons  @xcite or using toroidal resonators  @xcite have been put forward .    here",
    "we propose a solid - state implementation of a quantum router using superconducting qubits . given an @xmath0-photon input , consisting of a train of photon pulses where each of them can be in two states ( or in a coherent superposition of both ) , the quantum switch absorbs the first photon and forwards the next @xmath1 photons to a path determined by the state of the first absorbed photon .",
    "our proposed device can be integrated in a larger network , where the output of one router is the input of the next . as a result , since the routers are controlled by the input signals there is no need to control the network externally .",
    "also it requires the same number of photons to send a signal through two different paths with the same number of nodes , while other proposals  @xcite may require less photons for some preferred paths , leading to a network where some routes ( e.g. , a route that at each bifurcation node takes the rightmost output path ) have higher efficiency than others .",
    "we analyze the dynamic operation of the router using quantum langevin equations combined with input / output scattering formalism , taking into account decoherence due to relaxation and dephasing .",
    "we predict successful operation of the router with probabilities above 94% under realistic experimental conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we present our proposal for the superconducting circuit that operates as a quantum router and derive the effective hamiltonian of the system .",
    "we then analyze the dynamics of operation of the quantum switch using a scattering approach and calculate the probabilities of reflection and transmission of an incoming photon . in the last section conclusions and a discussion of the possible applications of this quantum device",
    "are presented .",
    "a schematic of the device we propose , based on circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] .",
    "the device is composed of three transmission lines capacitively coupled to four squids and a transmon , acting as artificial atoms that absorb and reflect or transmit the photons forward .",
    "the device operates as follows : the first photon of a register that arrives at the switch is absorbed by the transmon which , after being excited , modifies the energy spectrum of the squids in such a way that the next photons can only be absorbed by the two squids labeled with @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) if the transmon is in its first ( higher ) excited state .",
    "the excited squid then decays while emitting a photon into its corresponding outgoing transmission line .",
    "the transmon also decays emitting a photon into the incoming transmission line .",
    "the capacitances @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are chosen such that they are smaller than any other capacitance in the system . in this way",
    ", the transmission of the control photon , which is the element of the register that controls the operation of the router , is prevented  @xcite .",
    "also the coupling strength between the squids and their farthest transmission line is strongly reduced if this condition on the capacitances is satisfied .    ) and a pair of josephson junctions ( with energies @xmath10 , etc . ) .",
    "it also contains a transmon qubit , consisting of a capacitor ( @xmath11 ) and a pair of josephson junctions ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "these five elements are capacitively coupled to an incoming transmission line ( @xmath13 ) and to two outgoing transmission lines ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the fluxes @xmath16 , in the nodes of the circuit , are quantized variables ( see @xcite for the quantization of these variables ) and describe the absorption and emission of incoming photons by the transmon and squids .",
    "[ fig : device ] ]    the dynamics of the router in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] is described by an effective hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath18 describes the energy levels of the transmon and squids and also the interaction between them : @xmath19 with @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the creation and annihilation operators for each of the energy levels of the system .",
    "these operators create an excitation with energy @xmath23 in the transmon or @xmath24 in the squids .",
    "the last term describes the density - density interaction between the @xmath25-th level of the transmon and the excitations in the @xmath26-th squid , with interaction strength @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 describes the exchange interaction between the transmon and squids with the transmission lines , which are modeled as a bath of harmonic oscillators  @xcite with ladder operators @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the first , second and third transmission lines , respectively : @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the interaction strength of this coupling is given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are the lifetimes of the excited levels of the transmon , and also @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which are the lifetimes of the squids .",

    "[ fig : device ]  @xcite is achieved by introducing a nonlinear capacitor in the transmon  @xcite ( see also sup . mat . ) .",
    "this nonlinear capacitor can be realized , e.g. , by placing carbon nanotubes between the plates of the capacitor  @xcite .",
    "these give rise to an energy spectrum that has the form @xmath37 for small voltages @xmath38@xcite .",

    "energy levels represented with solid lines are coupled only to the incoming transmission line .",
    "dashed lines describe levels coupled to the second outgoing transmission line and also the incoming one .",
    "dotted lines describe levels coupled to the third outgoing transmission line and also the incoming one .",
    "the separation of the energy levels is not to scale.[fig : spect1 ] ]     or @xmath39 ( or a superposition of both ) can only excite the energy levels coupled to the second outgoing transmission line .",
    "( b ) if the third energy level of the transmon has been excited , the same photon can only excite the energy levels coupled to the third outgoing transmission line.[fig : spect2 ] ]    the energy spectrum of the device , described by the hamiltonians @xmath18 and @xmath28 [ eq .  ( [ eq : hsys ] ) and   ( [ eq : hc ] ) ] , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spect1 ] . in this figure",
    "the three levels of the transmon are represented with solid lines .",
    "the energy levels of the squids , in dashed lines ( coupled to the second transmission line ) and dotted lines ( coupled to the third transmission line ) , do not coincide since all the capacitances and josephson energies are different . after sending a control photon with energy @xmath40 or @xmath41 into the router ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spect2 ] ) , due to the coupling between the transmon and squid energy levels described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsys ] ) , the energy needed to create an excitation in squid @xmath2 when the first level in the transmon is occupied can be made equal to the energy needed to create an excitation in squid @xmath4 when the third level in the transmon is occupied ( likewise for @xmath3 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "this can be done by tuning the energies of the josephson junctions of the system .",
    "thus , the transmon the control element of the router forwards a photon with energy @xmath42 ( or @xmath39 ) to the second or third transmission line , depending solely on the state of the control photon .",
    "the transmission lines are described by a continuum of oscillating modes as  @xcite : @xmath43",
    "in order to analyze the dynamics of the quantum router we have studied the scattering of one and two photons by our proposed device . here",
    "we calculate the probabilities of reflection and transmission through each of the output channels .",
    "we start by deriving the langevin equations from the effective hamiltonian @xmath44 [ eq .  ( [ eq : heff ] ) ] including relaxation and dephasing  @xcite .",
    "we then obtain the equations of motion within the input / output formalism of quantum optics  @xcite . from these equations",
    "we obtain the scattering amplitude of transmission and reflection of photons , assuming a lorentzian pulse shape for the incoming photons  @xcite .    due to the multiple energy levels of the transmon ( depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spect1 ] ) , the equation of motion for this element of the system in terms of the operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 introduced after quantizing the fluxes  @xcite is a complicated equation to work with . in order to simplify the calculations we introduce three projection operators @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 and their hermitian conjugate whose definition can be found in the supp .",
    "mat. to replace @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , we have limited our hilbert space by considering only three excited energy levels in the transmon and only one in each of the squids .",
    "these operators , with the properties @xmath50 and also @xmath51 with @xmath52 being the ground state of the transmon and @xmath53 its excited states , are projection operators that do not satisfy the usual commutation relations , so special care has to be taken when working with them . on the other hand ,",
    "one of the advantages of using these three operators is that , although we will have three equations for the transmon instead of one , they are easier to solve .",
    "the use of these three operators instead of the original one does not change the model as long as the number of excited states of the transmon is limited to three .",
    "another advantage of using this notation is that the final quantized hamiltonian takes a simpler form [ the results being eqns .",
    "( [ eq : hsys ] ) and  ( [ eq : hc ] ) ] and is easier to interpret : the operator describing the occupation of the @xmath25-th level of the transmon is simply @xmath54 .    before deriving the langevin equations we must find an expression that describes the incoming and outgoing photons in the input / output formalism .",
    "following  @xcite we introduce the operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and their hermitian conjugates , which create an incoming and an outgoing photon in the second transmission line ( the same procedure must be applied to the other two transmission lines ) .",
    "these operators are defined as ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the frequency of the photon and @xmath59 is an initial ( or final ) value of the heisenberg operator defined at a time @xmath60 for the input operator ( or @xmath61 for the output operator ) .",
    "the langevin equations of the ` static ' variables of the system in terms of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are shown in the supp . mat .",
    "once the langevin equations are found , relaxation and dephasing ratios are then introduced into this set of equations by following refs .",
    "@xcite .    within the input / output formalism",
    ", the scattering amplitude for a photon with frequency @xmath26 in transmission line 1 to be reflected or transmitted in a transmission line @xmath25 with frequency @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 in the case that multiple photons are sent in , the scattering amplitude reads @xmath67 these scattering amplitudes are valid for incoming photons with a definite frequency @xmath68 each or a superposition of these . assuming that the incoming photons have a frequency distribution given by a lorentzian centered at @xmath69 and with width @xmath70 , the scattering amplitude of a photon with frequency @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 the probability of this process to happen is given by : @xmath73",
    "let us consider again the single photon processes .",
    "for a good performance of the quantum router , the first photon to arrive must be absorbed by the transmon and be reflected back after all the other photons have been transmitted .",
    "it is , thus , necessary to find a procedure to find out whether the photon has been reflected after being absorbed or without being absorbed .",
    "for this purpose we describe the incoming photons as even modes given by the superposition of left and right - moving modes as @xmath74  @xcite . with this procedure one can see , after computing the scattering amplitudes and the probabilities , that a photon described as an even mode is absorbed ( and reflected ) with a large probability ( see tables  [ tab:1ph ] and  [ tab:2ph ] below ) . moreover , the probability of transmission of subsequent photons is enhanced if these are even modes .    the probabilities of reflection and transmission of photons are obtained by numerically integrating the squared scattering amplitude over all momenta and imposing the conditions @xmath75 and , similarly , @xmath76 .",
    "this ensures that the router is controlled by the state of the first incoming photon .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in tables  [ tab:1ph ] and [ tab:2ph ] .",
    "the first table contains the probabilities of transmission of an incoming photon with different frequencies @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath77 and @xmath42 through the second and third transmission lines together with the probabilities of reflection in case this photon is described as an even mode or as a right - moving mode ( see sup . mat . and",
    "@xcite for a description of these modes ) . in the case of a photon with energy @xmath40 or @xmath41 , since",
    "both energy levels are coupled only to the incoming transmission lines [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hc ] ) ] , we find a large probability of reflection , above 94% . it is interesting to notice the different behavior of the router with respect to the form of the modes . in case",
    "the photons are described by even modes , the probability amplitude of reflection scales as @xmath78 for a photon with frequency @xmath40 . in this expression",
    ", @xmath79 is the rate of decoherence and @xmath33 is the lifetime of the excited energy level in the transmon . in case of right - moving modes , since a right - moving mode is reflected as a left - moving mode if it is absorbed and as a right - moving mode if it is reflected but not absorbed  @xcite , the corresponding expression in table  [ tab:1ph ] represents the probability that a photon is absorbed and reflected , with an amplitude that is given by @xmath80    .probabilities of reflection and transmission of an incoming photon .",
    "the probabilities in this table have been computed for different frequencies of the incoming photons and considering both even modes and right - moving modes .",
    "similar values can be obtained for left - moving modes .",
    "the probability of reflection of a right - moving photon , as computed here , is equivalent to the probability of absorption plus reflection of the incoming photon .",
    "[ tab:1ph ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the values in table  [ tab : cap ] , the energies are found to be around @xmath81 for the transmon energy levels ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) and around @xmath84 for the squids ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "the coupling strength is of the order of @xmath89 .",
    "all these values are common in the related literature .",
    "also , we used the ratio @xmath90 which , although being larger than in other circuit - qed works , is sufficient to give rise to the nonlinear effects needed for the correct operation of the quantum router  @xcite .    for the two - photon processes , we have made some assumptions : from the single - photon process , we have seen that the transmon absorbs the first incoming photon with a large probability , so for the two - photon processes we assumed that we sent the second photon while the transmon is already excited and that it does not decay emitting the control photon until the second photon has been fully transmitted .",
    "this implies that the lifetime of the transmon is much larger than that of the squids .",
    "this is a plausible assumption , given that the lifetimes of such cqed devices depend not only on the elements they are composed of but also on the geometry of the system ( purcell effect , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we comment on the possibility to use the quantum router in a larger network containing many quantum routers such that the transmitted photons of one router can be used as control photons in the next node of the network .",
    "this means that a photon transmitted by the router , which has enough energy to excite one of the squids , can also excite the transmon in the next router .",
    "therefore , in a scalable network where all the routers are identical , the energy needed to excite the transmon ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) is the same as the energy needed to excite one of the squids ( @xmath42 or @xmath39 ) . in our ( optimized ) model , however , the energy of the first excited level of the transmon is one order of magnitude larger than that of the squids with the current set of capacitances . a possible solution may be to add a device between the two consecutive routers that enlarges the energy of the first photon to arrive .",
    "stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) processes may be a candidate for a device capable of transferring the population of one quantum state ( with lower energy ) to another ( with higher energy ) .",
    "these processes have been studied in circuit qed systems in  @xcite .",
    "so far , different proposals for quantum switches or routers that may be implemented in a quantum network have been studied  @xcite . in order to assess the suitability of a given implementation for efficient use in a quantum communication network",
    ", we list here a set of requirements that we believe a quantum router must satisfy ( part of these have been proposed elsewhere  @xcite ) .",
    "the list below contains general requirements , which can be applied and checked for specific implementations .",
    "imagine we have a network for quantum communication composed of quantum channels ( which allow for the transmission of quantum information ) and nodes ( which contain quantum routers ) .",
    "consider also that there is a signal to be sent and an element that controls the switches .    1 .",
    "the information in the signal to be transmitted and also the information encoded in the control elements must be stored in quantum objects ( qubits ) .",
    "otherwise we can not talk about a fully quantum - mechanical router  @xcite .",
    "2 .   the router has to be able to route the ( quantum ) signal into a coherent superposition of both output modes  @xcite .",
    "3 .   the signal information must remain undisturbed during the entire routing process  @xcite .",
    "the control information must also remain undisturbed , so that we can keep track of the signal and verify that it is not modified ( due to e.g. , entanglement with the control element ) .",
    "4 .   the router has to work without any need for postselection on the signal output  @xcite .",
    "5 .   to optimize the resources of the quantum network , only a single control qubit is required to direct each signal qubit  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the control information could also be stored in the signal qubit itself  @xcite , but that may give the receiver information about the network which , in some applications , may not be a good idea .",
    "6 .   with one single control qubit , as many as possible signal qubits should be forwarded .",
    "a router with @xmath0 outputs must operate with the same efficiency ( or speed , or with the same number of operations , etc . ) for each output channel .",
    "scalability : the output of a router should be the input of the next one in a network .    the quantum router that we propose satisfies all of these requirements except for the last one ( although , as we discussed in the previous section , this problem can for example be amended by using stirap processes ) .",
    "we thus believe that it can become a good candidate for a quantum switch or router in a network for quantum communication .",
