    "since the recent discovery of the carbon nanotubes by iijima @xcite there has been a significant progress @xcite in the studies of the conducting properties of both single - walled @xcite and multi - walled @xcite carbon nanotubes .",
    "conductance of a mesoscopic system connected to metallic reservoirs is well understood and is usually described by the landauer formula @xcite . for quantum point contacts in semiconductor structures and in metallic nanowires",
    "it is well establish experimentally that the differential conductance to a good approximation is quantized in units of @xmath1 and at zero temperature given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of propagating modes . in carbon nanotubes with metallic contacts",
    "most experiments show that the conductance is less than the conductance which one should expect for a smooth interface between tube and metal , e.g. @xmath4 for metallic single - walled tubes where the extra factor of 2 comes from the two @xmath5 bands that are crossing the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the reasons for this lower conductance are still not fully known .",
    "theoretically , several groups have considered the effects of vacancies @xcite , disorder @xcite , distortion @xcite , and doping @xcite on the conductance of carbon nanotubes .",
    "the conducting properties have also been studied in e.g. the context of junctions between different metallic carbon nanotubes @xcite , aharonow ",
    "bohm effect in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite , and the luttinger liquid behavior of a one - dimensional gas of interacting electrons @xcite .",
    "also the ideal `` hollow quantum cylinder '' , i.e. a two - dimensional electron gas on a cylinder , has been studied in context of the difference between strip - like wires and tubes @xcite . however , with the exception of the recent qualitative study of tersoff @xcite and the recent modeling - works of anantram _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and sanvito _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , less attention has been focused on the conditions for a good transmission between tube and a metal contact which is an important issue for practical devices with carbon nanotubes , or other quantum tubes .    in quantum point",
    "contacts an adiabatic interface between the wire and reservoirs ensures a transmission coefficient close to unity @xcite .",
    "the condition for adiabaticity is that the shape of the contact region varies slowly on the scale of the fermi wave length . in the opposite case with an abrupt interface ,",
    "i.e. quasi - one - dimensional lead connected to a wide two - dimensional contact , szafer and stone @xcite found that the transmission rapidly increases to unity as the width of the confined region exceeds half of the fermi wavelength , thus giving a reflectionless contact .    for the contact between a quantum tube and a three - dimensional metal it is not obvious that the assumption of an ideal reflectionless contact applies and the aim of this work is to study the contact resistance for this case .",
    "the model we are studying is that of a hollow quantum cylinder of radius @xmath6 contacted by a three - dimensional free - electron metal which we for convenience model by a cylindrical wire with radius @xmath7 , see fig .",
    "the system thus has full cylindrical symmetry and the angular momentum quantum number @xmath8 can therefore be used to label the scattering states .    for the coupling of the quantum tube to the contact it is necessary to take a radial confinement potential for the quantum tube into account and here we model the confinement by an attractive delta - function potential .",
    "as an example we apply this model to metal contacts of al or au ; the quantum tube parameters are chosen to mimic armchair carbon nanotubes : the strength of the confinement can be related to the work function for the material that constitutes the tube and in the case of a carbon nanotube we relate it to the work function of graphene .",
    "it should be noted that the employed free electron model does not fully describe the actual band structure of carbon nanotubes .",
    "nevertheless , a study of contact resistance within this idealized model should yield valuable insights which are relevant to real materials .    the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the eigenstates of a quantum tube connected to a cylindrical metal contact are found . in section iii",
    "these eigenstates are used to construct the scattering states to find the transmission coefficient , and hence the conductance of the contact . in section iv",
    ", we apply our model to contacts between an armchair carbon nanotube and a metal . finally , in section v discussion and conclusions",
    "are given .",
    "essential details of analytical calculations are given in appendices a and b.",
    "we separate the discussion into two parts : first we find the eigenstates in the tubular geometry and then the eigenstates for the cylindrical metal contact . in section",
    "iii the matching of these eigenstates are used to construct the scattering states of the contact .",

    "the fermi energy being defined positive . for the tube ,",
    "the fermi energy enters as @xmath98 .",

    "we need to specify @xmath101 , which follows from the work function @xmath102^{2}/2m_e$ ] .",
    "we have neglected the charge density induced at the interface by a mismatch of the work functions . for a discussion of this in the context of the screening properties of one - dimensional systems ,",
    "see e.g. ref . @xcite .",
    "the @xmath103 armchair single - walled carbon nanotube can be regarded as the result of rolling one sheet of graphite ( with the carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice ) in the direction of one of the bonds @xcite .",
    "the resulting tube has a periodicity @xmath104 along the tube axis ( @xmath105-axis ) and a radius @xmath106 with @xmath107 atoms along the perimeter , arranged in two rows that resemble a chain of armchairs , see fig .",
    "their metallic character is caused by two @xmath5 bands crossing the fermi level at a wave vector @xmath108 .    as discussed recently by tersoff",
    "@xcite the metallic armchair carbon nanotubes have electrons at the fermi level which can be regarded as having an angular momentum quantum number @xmath43 . in order to apply our simple model to the problem of the contact resistance of @xmath103 single - walled carbon nanotubes embedded in a free - electron metal we notice that @xmath109 . in fig . [ fig3 ] the transmission probability at the fermi level is shown for several values of @xmath110 corresponding to @xmath103 armchair carbon nanotubes for various values of the dimensionless confinement strength @xmath101 . in the particular case of an al contact ,",
    "the mismatch is given by @xmath111 and the corresponding transmission is presented in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in panel",
    "( b ) we show similar results for an au contact for which @xmath112 .    in order to estimate @xmath101",
    "we relate it to the work function of the carbon nanotube which is of the order @xmath113 . for the quantum tube we associate a work function to the @xmath43 bound state via its binding energy , i.e. @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the solution to @xmath116 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] this work function is shown as a function of the confinement strength for quantum tubes corresponding to @xmath103 armchair carbon nanotubes . from this",
    "we estimate that @xmath117 is a reasonable regime for the curves shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "this means that a transmission close to unity ( per band at the fermi level ) can be expected if the armchair nanotube is embedded in free - electron metals like al or au . assuming a work function @xmath118 of the nanotube we have used the corresponding value of @xmath101 to calculate the transmission for the different nanotubes . for @xmath103 armchair nanotubes with al and au contacts we find @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively . in the case of matching fermi wave vectors ( @xmath121 ) we get @xmath122 . for the considered tubes ( @xmath123 ) ,",
    "these transmissions are found to be almost independent of the specific value of the tube indices @xmath103 .",
    "here we have only taken the geometry - related contact scattering into account .",
    "physically , a lower transmission can be caused by electrons being scattered by interface imperfections / roughness , deviations from a spherical fermi surface of the metal contact , and scattering due to non - matching work functions of the nanotube and metal . also scattering due to the non - matching fermi velocities of the nanotube and the metal",
    "could be expected . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , a mismatch between fermi wave vectors can actually in some cases increase the transmission ( and thereby the conductance ) due to quantum interferences , even though the mismatch by itself is known to give rise to momentum relaxation and thereby resistance .",
    "we have considered the contact resistance ( in terms of transmission ) of a quantum tube embedded in a free - electron metal . for the quantum tube",
    "we have modeled the radial confinement of the electron motion by an attractive delta function potential which gives rise to at least one bound state in the radial direction .",
    "the strength of the attractive potential can phenomenologically be associated to the work function of the quantum tube . within this model",
    "we have calculated the transmission of a quantum tube contacted by a free - electron metal .",
    "due to the cylindrical geometry of the contact , considerable analytical progress was possible and with the resulting equations the scattering problem is readily solved numerically .    as an application we have considered the transparency of contacts with armchair carbon nanotubes embedded in free - electron metals .",
    "our calculations show that in the absence of scattering mechanisms associated to e.g. interface imperfections / roughness , deviations from a spherical fermi surface of the metal contact , and scattering due to non - matching work functions of the nanotube and metal , the geometry itself allows for a high transparent contact between armchair carbon nanotubes and free - electron metal contacts .",
    "furthermore , from this simple model we find that al would be a good candidate for such a metal as it was suggested recently by tersoff @xcite . for au however",
    ", we find that the present 3d geometry allows for good contact in contrast to tersoff s findings for au , which were based on 1d considerations .",
