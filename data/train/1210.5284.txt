    "it is a generic phenomenon that spectral gaps are formed when waves propagate in periodic media , and eigenmodes can exist with frequencies inside the spectral gaps if a defect is introduced to break the system s perfect translational symmetry , and create an effective potential well to localise these waves.@xcite fusion plasmas have a few periodicities that can produce spectral gaps : geodesic curvature of field lines,@xcite elongation@xcite or triangularity of flux surfaces,@xcite helicity@xcite and periodic mirroring in stellerators.@xcite weakly damped eigenmodes which are readily destabilised by energetic ions often reside in these gaps , and they may degrade fast ion confinement.@xcite the most extensively studied gap eigenmode is the toroidcity - induced alfvn eigenmode ( tae),@xcite however , there are also numerous other modes with similar features.@xcite    zhang @xcite observed a spectral gap in the shear alfvn wave continuum in experiments on large plasma device ( lapd ) with a multiple magnetic mirror array , and obtained consistent results through two - dimensional numerical modelling using the finite difference code , electromagnetic solver ( ems).@xcite although eigenmodes inside this gap were not formed , a possible experimental implementation was proposed to detect them .",

    "such an eigenmode could be excited by energetic electrons , similarly to the excitation of toroidal alfvn eigenmodes ( tae ) by energetic ions in tokamaks .",
