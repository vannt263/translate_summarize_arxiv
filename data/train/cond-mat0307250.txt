    "the study of the ground state properties of disordered systems reveals deep connections with the field of random combinatorial optimization : in fact combinatorial optimization problems can be stated in terms of zero - temperature statistical properties of some disordered system hamiltonian .",
    "a closely related issue is the _ computational complexity _ of a given problem that can be stated in terms of the typical amount of time ( _ e.g. _ cpu - cycles ) that is needed to solve the problem as a function of its size @xcite .",
    "easy / hard thresholds have been observed in different combinatorial optimization problems @xcite , and a currently highly debated issue is the interplay between the onset of the phase transition and the slowing down of local search algorithms @xcite",
    ". a better understanding of the organization of the lowest energy configurations is then a promising research program not only to relate the _ computational complexity _ of a given problem to its statistical mechanics counterpart , but also as a guide for the implementation of more efficient algorithms .",
    "recently the problem of diluted mean field spin glasses received a renewed interest by means of the _ cavity approach _ @xcite .",
    "interestingly this method turned out to be a powerful tool also to deal with combinatorial optimization problems . in this paper",
    "we study the problem of the organization of the lowest energy configurations within this framework .",
    "our aim is to explore the way the energy of a configuration varies as a function of its overlap with the ground state .",
    "the naive procedure consisting in computing the ground state , then picking at random configurations and look at their distance to the ground state is not computationally practicable : configurations are far too numerous for this sampling to be efficient , let alone that one has to do it for numerous instances of the coupling constants in order to get relevant averaged quantities .",
    "we need to generate configurations whose energy density is somewhat under control .",
    "the technique we use consists in perturbing the hamiltonian to increase the energy of the ground state , then compute the new ground state .",
    "the perturbation is chosen proportional to a small parameter @xmath0 which we can tune to make the new ground state more or less distant from the original one : hereafter we will refer to this method as @xmath0-coupling .",
    "this is actually not a new idea @xcite , however to our knowledge so far this technique has been implemented only in numerical simulations .",
    "here we show that an analytic solution is possible in the case of the simple random matching problem as well as the case of spin glasses on random graphs of fixed connectivity .",
    "in a recent paper aldous and percus @xcite used similar techniques to study the matching problem ( both in the euclidean and mean field versions ) and the traveling salesman problem , conjecturing that it is possible to classify optimization problems into different universality classes according to the dependence of the ground state solution on small perturbations .",
    "we will compare our results to those presented in @xcite , and we will explain how the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) transition can be detected within the cavity scheme .",
    "let us point out that we will restrict our analysis to the level of the replica symmetric ( rs ) approximation although in principle there is no problem to extend the same analysis to higher level of replica symmetry breaking ; we will discuss this possibility and the potential interest of this generalization in the context of other combinatorial optimization problems ( _ e.g. _ sat @xcite and coloring @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of the paper has the following structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : matching ] we study the random simple matching problem : after a description of the model we show how the cavity approach works in general for this model and we introduce a generalization in order to deal with @xmath0-coupled systems . in sec .",

    "[ sec : concl ] some conclusions and perspectives are presented .",
    "given an unoriented graph @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are the vertices and @xmath3 are the edges , a _ matching _",
    "@xmath4 is a set of edges having the property that no two edges in @xmath4 have an end in common .",
    "we say that a vertex @xmath5 is _ matched _ if there is an edge incident to @xmath6 in the matching .",
    "otherwise the vertex is _ unmatched_. a matching is called _ perfect _ if every vertex of @xmath7 is matched .    in the following we stick to the case where @xmath7 is _ complete _ ,",
    "i.e. there is an edge between any two vertices , and when we speak of a matching we mean a perfect matching .",
    "we introduce a function @xmath8 defined on the set of edges @xmath3 which associates a real number @xmath9 to each edge @xmath10 .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 can be thought of as a distance , or ",
    "depending on the taste  as a weight , a cost , etc .",
    "we define the total length of a matching @xmath4 as @xmath11 .",
    "the matching problem consists in finding the cheapest matching , i.e. which minimizes @xmath12 .",
    "a classic example is the random euclidean matching problem : the vertices are identified with @xmath13 points drawn at random with the flat measure in the unit hypercube of a @xmath14-dimension euclidean space .",
    "the cost @xmath9 of an edge @xmath15 is the usual euclidean distance between the two vertices @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "a mean field approximation of the euclidean problem has been widely investigated @xcite : the weights of the edges are i.i.d .",
    "random variables whose common probability distribution @xmath17 is defined on the interval @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath19 is assumed to behave like an integer power law for small @xmath8 : @xmath20 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath21 limit , the mean distance of two nearest neighbors goes to 0 like @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "intuitively a minimum matching will only include edges of this order of magnitude , so that the only relevant feature of @xmath17 is its behavior around 0 , i.e. the @xmath24 exponent .",
    "the one - edge and two - edge length distributions in this model match the ones of the euclidean random matching problem in dimension @xmath25 for short distances .",
    "hereafter we will concentrate on the case @xmath26 .",
    "we will use the following conventions : there are @xmath13 vertices ; the distances @xmath27 between two vertices are i.i.d .",
    "random variables distributed following the flat distribution on @xmath28 $ ] ( this corresponds to a rescaling of a factor @xmath13 with respect to eq.([powerlaw ] ) ) ; as a shorthand notation , we indicate the set of these coupling constants as @xmath29 .",
    "the length of the minimum matching is an extensive quantity , and the energy ( hamiltonian ) of a matching can be defined equal to its length .",
    "a matching @xmath4 can be univoquely represented by a contact matrix @xmath30 such that :    * @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "* @xmath33 : no self linkage is allowed .",
    "* @xmath34 : each site can not be linked more than once .",
    "obviously @xmath35 if the edge @xmath36 is not in @xmath4 , and @xmath37 if the edge @xmath36 is in @xmath4 . the entry @xmath38 is called the _ occupation number _ of the edge @xmath36 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the matching then reads : @xmath39 where @xmath29 plays the role of the quenched disorder , and the @xmath38 are the dynamic local variables .",
    "the cavity equations at finite temperature for the matching problem have been derived in @xcite ( a comprehensive introduction to this subject is found in @xcite ) .",
    "let us briefly reproduce the basic steps following @xcite .",
    "the partition function for the matching problem is @xmath40 where the scaling factor @xmath13 makes the free energy @xmath41 an extensive quantity .",
    "following polymers theory @xcite , one first introduces a more tractable representation of the partition function , which consists in mapping the matching problem onto a system of interacting spins . on each vertex @xmath42 one puts a @xmath43-dimensional vector spin @xmath44 normalized by @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 be the integration measure on the corresponding sphere .",
    "if we define the coupling constants @xmath47 , one can check that the partition function ( [ defz ] ) can be written as : @xmath48 \\exp \\left ( \\sum_{1\\leq i < j\\leq n }",
    "t_{ij } { \\bf s}_i.{\\bf s}_j \\right)\\,\\,.\\ ] ] expanding the exponential into a power series and applying the following property : @xmath49 one can easily recover ( [ defz ] ) from ( [ defz ] ) .",
    "note also that the magnetization vector of spin @xmath42 has components @xmath50 .",
    "the cavity method consists in adding a new spin @xmath51 to a @xmath13-site system @xmath52 .",
    "the new partition function is calculated assuming that the statistical correlations in the @xmath13-site system can be neglected .",
    "more rigorously we make use of the _ clustering theorem _ , tacitly assuming that the system has just one pure state .",
    "we can thus encode the effect of the whole system onto each spin @xmath42 as an effective field @xmath53 . the @xmath13 + 1-site",
    "partition function can be written as : @xmath54 \\exp \\left ( \\sum_{i=1}^n h_i s_i + \\sum_{i = 1}^n t_{0i } { \\bf s}_0.{\\bf s}_i \\right)\\,,\\ ] ] and can be easily computed thanks to ( [ loi ] ) , giving : @xmath55 where we have used the fact that @xmath56 , the magnetization of site @xmath42 before the addition of site @xmath57 is @xmath58 . at the end of the day we are not interested in the spin variables but in the solution of the matching problem .",
    "the thermal average of the occupation number of the edge @xmath57@xmath42 is simply related to the magnetizations by : @xmath59 since we will be interested eventually in the ground state properties of this model we have to take the @xmath60 limit of our equations .",
    "following @xcite it is useful to set @xmath61 the zero temperature limit of ( [ eq_tap ] ) and ( [ occup ] ) , thanks to ( [ mtransf ] ) , reduces to the following zero - temperature cavity relation : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the index attaining the minimum @xmath64 .",
    "the idea of the @xmath0-coupling method in the context of the matching problem is the following : given the set @xmath29 of @xmath65 distances ( called 0-distances ) , one first finds the minimum matching ( called 0-ground state ) , which is characterized by some occupation numbers @xmath38 .",
    "then one perturbs the lengths of the edges of the graph by adding a quantity @xmath0 to the edges present in the 0-ground state .",
    "formally the edge - lengths become the following @xmath0-distances :    @xmath66    one solves the matching problem with these @xmath0-distances and obtains a solution we will name @xmath0-ground state , which is expected to be different from the 0-ground state .",
    "the larger @xmath0 , the stronger the 0-ground state is penalized .",
    "the @xmath0-ground state is characterized by the occupation numbers @xmath67 .",
    "two quantities are of interest : first the difference of length ( energy ) between the @xmath0-ground state and the 0-ground state computed with the 0-distances : @xmath68 second the distance @xmath14 between the @xmath0-ground state and the 0-ground state : @xmath69 where the overlap @xmath70 is equal to the proportion of edges in common : @xmath71 more precisely one would like to compute the average with respect to the coupling constants of these quantities , so let us define @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "an analytic approach is possible in the framework of the cavity method .",
    "we have two spin systems , the 0-system and the @xmath0-system , standing on the same graph , and which are coupled .",
    "more precisely the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-system is conditioned by the ground state of the 0-system .    while the 0-system certainly obeys the cavity equations ( [ eq_cav_mat ] ) , how to deal with the @xmath0-system is more problematic .",
    "naive _ approach would lead us to : @xmath74 where @xmath75 nevertheless these equations are wrong !",
    "they would be true if the interactions between the old spins in the @xmath0-system of @xmath76 spins were the same as in the @xmath0-system of @xmath13 spins , and this is not exactly the case : when adding the new spin to the 0-system , it gets matched to one of the old spins , whose previous match becomes unmatched . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", one should distinguish between matched and unmatched spins in the 0-system .",
    "the variable @xmath77 of the @xmath0-system will be called @xmath78 if the vertex @xmath42 is matched in the 0-system , and @xmath79 if it is not .",
    "the correct equations are thus : @xmath80 where @xmath81 the new spin in the @xmath0-system gets matched to the spin @xmath82 , the index which minimizes eq.([second_case ] ) .",
    "the contribution to the overlap @xmath83 is @xmath84 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath85 is @xmath86 .    when averaging over the disorder , in the thermodynamic limit the quantities @xmath87 and @xmath88 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables ( beware that @xmath89 , @xmath6 and @xmath90 on the same site are correlated ) .",
    "the above equations ( [ eq_cav_mat ] ) and ( [ eqepssys ] ) define a stochastic flow whose fixed point is the limit distribution of @xmath91 . we use a population algorithm similar to the one discussed in @xcite to solve the equations . in order to save computing time , we use a fluctuating connectivity approximation of the matching problem : we keep the only edges whose lengths are smaller than a given cutoff @xmath92 , so that the connectivity of a vertex is a poisson r.v . of mean @xmath92 . we store a large population of @xmath93 triplets @xmath94 , which we initialize randomly and",
    "update iteratively : at each step an integer @xmath95 is extracted following the poisson distribution of mean @xmath92 , @xmath95 random elements of the population are chosen and we compute @xmath87 following the scheme defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq_cav_mat ] ) , ( [ eqepssys ] ) and ( [ second_case ] ) limiting the search for the min to the @xmath95 extracted triplets ; the resulting @xmath87 overwrites an element of the population chosen at random .",
    "once stochastic convergence of the population is achieved , we keep on iterating and compute _ en passant _ the contributions to @xmath85 and @xmath83 .",
    "their flat averages over many steps provide @xmath96 and @xmath97 .     _ vs. _ @xmath14 .",
    "the points obtained by the cavity population algorithm with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 iterations ( cavity ) , coincide with the measures obtained by averaging over 4000 samples of total number of points @xmath101 ( true ) . ]",
    "the output of this algorithm is presented in figs .",
    "( [ de_versus_d.ps ] ) and ( [ fig : fits ] ) .",

    "note that a simple scaling argument shows that the two exponents are not independent : let us assume that for @xmath105 small enough @xmath108 , then from eq .",
    "( [ eq_delta_l ] ) @xmath109 . the scaling exponent @xmath110 introduced by aldous and percus @xcite",

    "an important remark is in order : in @xcite aldous introduces and proves the following _ asymptotic essential uniqueness _",
    "property :    let @xmath4 be the generic element of a family of matchings depending both on @xmath13 and on the realization of the @xmath65 ; we call @xmath116 the overlap between @xmath4 and the minimum matching , and @xmath117 their distance",
    ".    for each @xmath118 there exists @xmath119 such that : if @xmath120 then @xmath121    in physical terms : in the thermodynamic limit , a matching ( configuration ) which differs from the ground state by a non zero proportion of edges has an energy density strictly greater than the one of the ground state .",
    "the other way round : a state with the same intensive energy density as the ground state can be obtained only by changing a non extensive number of edges in the ground state .",
    "this is the proof that there is no rsb , at least at zero temperature .",
    "the plot in fig.([de_versus_d.ps ] ) can be seen as an illustration of this theorem .    to conclude , note that our perturbation of the energy is @xmath122 so the information we get on the energy landscape is limited .",
    "in particular we do not explore the lowest lying excited configurations which have been numerically shown to have an energy @xmath123 and @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "this is a limitation of our analytic approach : it is purely thermodynamic so that we can not have a hint at finite size effects .",
    "in close analogy with the previous section , we derive cavity equations for the @xmath0-coupling method applied to the gaussian spin glass on the bethe lattice of connectivity @xmath125 , in the presence of an external field .",
    "we keep to the level of the rs approximation .",
    "we will see that our results provide a self - consistency check of this hypothesis which enables to trace out when it is valid or not .    throughout this section",
    "we make thorough use of the notations introduced in our previous article @xcite .",
    "we refer to sections ii and iii therein for details .      first ,",
    "following mzard and parisi @xcite we work out the cavity method directly at zero temperature for a single system of @xmath13 spins @xmath126 interacting through coupling constants @xmath127  their set being denoted @xmath128  which are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with a gaussian distribution of mean 0 and variance 1 , in the presence of an external field @xmath129 .",
    "let us consider the merging process of @xmath95 branches rooted at spins @xmath130 onto a new spin @xmath131 illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ tree ] ) .",
    "we look at how the energy of the ground state evolves under this process . before the merging , on a given branch , we let the spin at the root undetermined .",
    "thus the ground state energy of the branch rooted at spin @xmath42 is conditioned by the value of the spin @xmath42 and can be written : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is a constant , and @xmath53 is an effective field ( beware that it is not the local field ) .",
    "note that @xmath53 contains the effect of the external field @xmath129 . as a consequence",
    ", the energy of the system of the @xmath95 branches before the merging is conditioned on the values of the spins @xmath134 , and reads @xmath135 the system after the merging has an energy @xmath136 which , in order to be that of the ground state , is to be minimized with respect to @xmath137 at fixed @xmath138 .",
    "this is realized by independently choosing the sign of each @xmath139 such that @xmath140 .",
    "as we can write @xmath141 where @xmath142 we get the appealing following form : @xmath143 by comparison with eq.([a branch before ] ) this leads to the recursion relation : @xmath144",
    "now we imagine there are two spin systems sitting on the @xmath13 vertices @xmath145 of the _ same _ bethe lattice :    * the @xmath126 spins obey the same hamiltonian as in the previous section [ the cavity equations for a single system at zero temperature ] : @xmath146 = - \\sum _ { \\la a , b \\ra } j_{a , b } \\sigma_a \\sigma_b - h_{ext } \\sum_a \\s_a.\\ ] ] let us call @xmath147 the ground state of this hamiltonian . *",
    "the @xmath148 spins obey the following perturbed hamiltonian , conditioned on the @xmath149 : @xmath150 = - \\sum _ { a , b } j_{a , b } \\tau_a \\tau_b -h_{ext } \\sum_a \\tau_a-\\epsilon \\sum_{a } \\sigma_a^*\\tau_a.\\ ] ] the choice @xmath151 corresponds to an attractive interaction for the @xmath148 spin variables to the configuration @xmath152 , the choice @xmath153 to a repulsion .",
    "the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ eq_ham_t ] ) is named @xmath154 .",
    "we are interested in the overlap @xmath155 where with the symbol @xmath156 we mean the average of a generic @xmath157-dependent observable @xmath158 over the different sample realizations .",
    "the correlations between the @xmath126 spins and the @xmath148 spins can be accounted for by stating that the value of the effective field acting onto spin @xmath159 depends on the value of spin @xmath138 , where @xmath131 is the root of an isolated branch .",
    "so we have to store three quantities related to the root @xmath131 of a branch :    * @xmath160 , the effective field acting onto spin @xmath138 ; * @xmath161 , the effective field acting onto spin @xmath159 under the condition that spin @xmath138 has the value + 1 ; * @xmath162 , the effective field acting onto spin @xmath159 under the condition that spin @xmath138 has the value -1 .",
    "when performing the merging of @xmath95 branches onto a new site , the equation for the system of the @xmath126 spins is exactly the same as in the previous section [ the cavity equations for a single system at zero temperature ] : @xmath144 as far as the @xmath148 spins are concerned , one must compute @xmath161 as well as @xmath162 .",
    "so we assume in turn that @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "this determines the values of the @xmath165 : @xmath166 and the effective field acting onto spin @xmath159 reads @xmath167      to measure the overlap , one uses the merging procedure of @xmath168 branches onto a new vertex @xmath169 : the effective field acting onto spin @xmath170 is : @xmath171 by contrast with the iteration , spin @xmath170 has a determined value , the one which minimizes the energy : @xmath172sign@xmath173 .",

    "we will see that so it is .",
    "thus the interesting regime is @xmath182 .",
    "what we obtain in the case @xmath183 is plotted in fig.([q_versus_eps_h0.ps ] ) .",

    "is lifted , the plot of @xmath83 as a function of @xmath153 is no longer a constant equal to -1",
    ". it does however tend to -1 when @xmath191 because in this limit the attracting term between the @xmath126 system and the @xmath148 system dominates the perturbed hamiltonian ( [ eq_ham_t ] ) .",
    "when @xmath192 @xmath83 goes continuously to a value which is no longer 0 , but is still not 1 . again",
    "the rs ansatz is in trouble .",

    "fixing @xmath187 , we let @xmath129 increase . see fig.([q_versus_h.eps ] ) : it appears that @xmath83 is an increasing function of @xmath129 and saturates to 1 at @xmath193 .",
    "it is the sign that the rs ansatz becomes self - consistent above @xmath194 .    for @xmath195",
    "we find @xmath196 which is different from the value @xmath197 found in @xcite by the analysis of numerical simulations .",
    "we believe our result is exact , and the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that their result relies on finite size scaling arguments with a relatively poor precision .",
    "what we got here is actually the point at @xmath198 of the de  almeida - thouless ( at ) line @xcite for the gaussian spin glass on the bethe lattice .",
    "we had the idea we could generalize our approach to a non zero temperature to determine the whole line .",

    "a crucial point is that whenever one randomly extracts sites or coupling constants , they are the _ same _ for the @xmath126 population and the @xmath148 population .",

    "a similar study presented in @xcite suggest that this property is also shared by the minimum spanning tree problem , the minimum matching problem in euclidean dimension @xmath212 , and the traveling salesman problem also in euclidean dimension @xmath212 ( all with @xmath213 ) .",
    "minimum matching problem and traveling salesman problem in @xmath214 are instead characterized by @xmath113 as the mean field matching problem we have studied .    a simple case with no _ asymptotic essential uniqueness _",
    "property is the spin glass on a fixed connectivity random graph studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaussian_sg ] . indeed our computation based on the rs assumption yields that @xmath215 which is a physical nonsense since the model has a unique ground state ( the couplings are gaussian ) .",
    "this inconsistency tells us not only that - as we already know after @xcite - the cavity approximation must be improved in order to take into account the presence of many states , but also gives us a practical tool to probe the phase space for the onset of full rsb : the search for the at line in the case of the spin glass on a fixed connectivity random graph , is a simple and instructive example .",
    "a very interesting issue is the generalization of the @xmath0-coupling method to the case where the _ asymptotic essential uniqueness _ does not hold . in the last year",
    "a compact and efficient formalism has been developed to apply the cavity method to sat and coloring problems @xcite , at the level of 1rsb , evidentiating a clustering transition .",
    "this clustering transition consists in the sudden appearance of an exponential number of metastable states , which - intuitively - cause local search algorithm to get stuck .",
    "we believe that it is possible to generalize the @xmath0-coupling method presented in this paper to the 1rsb level , although at a higher computational cost . this could give interesting results on the inner mechanism of the clustering of states .",
    "open problems like how large a single cluster could be and what the inter - cluster mean distance is , could be addressed within this formalism .",
