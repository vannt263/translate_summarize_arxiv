    "nuclear fission is still not completely understood , although it was discovered eight decades ago .",
    "the study of fission mass distribution is one of the major insight of the fission process . conventionally , there are two different approaches , the statistical and the dynamical approaches for the study of fission process @xcite .",
    "the latter is a collective calculations of the potential energy surface and the mass asymmetry .",
    "further , the fission fragments were determined either as the minima in the potential energy surface or by the maximum in the wkb penetration probability integral for the fission fragments .",
    "the statistical theory @xcite , begins with the statistical equilibrium is established from the saddle to scission point and the relative probability of the fission process depends on the density of the quantum states of the fragments at scission point .",

    ", we study the structure effects of the fission fragments , whether they could influence the yield or not ?",
    "if it influences , to what extent of the temperature it affects the probable fragmentation .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we present a brief description of the statistical theory and the trmf formalism . in section [ sec3 ] , we discuss the variation of the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath5 of the fragments with the temperature and study the structure effects of the fission fragments in the mass distribution .",
    "the summary and conclusions of our results are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we constraint the charge to mass ratio of the fission fragments to that of the parent nucleus i.e. , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 = 1 and 2 ) correspond to mass and charge number of the parent nucleus and fission fragments , respectively @xcite .",
    "the constraints , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are imposed to account for the mass and charge conservations . for @xmath14pu , which is a representative case in the present study ,",
    "the binary charge numbers are restricted to @xmath15 26 and @xmath16 66 by considering the experimental yield @xcite .",
    "according to statistical theory @xcite , the probability of the particular fragmentation is directly proportional to the folded level density @xmath17 of that fragments with the total excitation energy @xmath18 . @xmath19",

    "the level density parameters @xmath22 are evaluated from the excitation energies and the temperature as @xmath27 .",
    "the relative yield is estimated as the ratio between the probability of a given fragmentation and the sum of the probabilities of all the possible fragmentations and it is given by , @xmath28 here , the sum of the total probability is normalized to the scale 2 .",
    "the competing basic decay modes such as neutron emission and @xmath29 decay are not considered and the presented results are the prompt disintegration of a parent nucleus into two fragments ( democratic breakup ) .",
    "the well known relativistic mean field theory considers the nucleon nucleon interaction via effective mesons .",

    "in addition , the binary fragmentations @xmath103ag @xmath104ag are favorable for both models . at temperature @xmath24 2 and 3 mev the yields of the minor fragments evolution in frdm model have increased .",

    "the other secondary fragmentations are not necessarily closed shell nuclei , so a good fraction of non - magic fragments are also appeared in the yield values .",
    "for higher temperature @xmath24 3 mev , the most favorable fragments for both models are more or less same .",
    "the fragment combinations @xmath111mo + @xmath112te and @xmath84ru + @xmath85sn are the most favorable fragments .",
    "in trmf model the most favorable fragments in region i and region ii have sharp peak yield values .",
    "but in frdm , the larger yields are at region ii only . conclusively ,",
    "for @xmath24 3 mev , one of the most favorable fragments are at the vicinity of the closed shell ( n @xmath113 ) or exactly at the closed shell ( n or z = 50 ) nuclei . as it is reported in many earlier works , that the rare earth nuclei in the range @xmath114 region shows , peculiar nature , such as shell closure behavior , most of the fragments are found in that region . also , the corresponding neutron numbers for such nuclei act like deformed shell closure at @xmath115 region . as a result",
    ", we get many neutron fragment in that region @xcite .",
    "although , the even - even fragments are more possible fission yield , in the present case , we find maximum number of fission yield is odd mass fragments as compared to the even - even combination . because of the level density of the odd mass fragments are higher than the even mass fragments as reported in ref .",
    "for this temperature , all nuclei become spherical , the excitation energy of the closed shell nuclei is higher than the other spherical nuclei .",
    "thus , the deformation of the fission fragments affects the most favorable distribution at the temperatures @xmath26 = 1 - 2 mev . in frdm model the temperature dependent deformations",
    "are not considered , so the most favorable fragments at @xmath26 = 2 and 3 mev are same .",
    "the binary fission mass distribution is studied within the statistical theory .",
    "the level densities and the excitation energies are calculated from the trmf and frdm formalisms .",
    "the trmf model includes the thermal evolutions of the pairing gaps and deformation in a self - consistent manner , while , they are ignored in the frdm .",
    "the excitation energies of the fragments are obtained from ground state results in the frdm calculations .",
    "so , the study of deformation effects on the fission fragments can be seen within the trmf formalism .",
    "the quadrupole deformations of fission fragments with the increasing temperature are also discussed .",
    "the structural effects of the fission fragments influence the most favorable yields at temperatures @xmath26 = 1 and 2 mev .",
    "for the temperature @xmath24 3 mev , one of the most favorable mass distribution ends up in the vicinity or exactly at the nucleon closed shell ( n@xmath11682 ) or ( n or z = 50 ) . although , the trmf and frdm formalisms yield the closed shell nucleus as one of the favorable fragment , the detail of the fission yields and probability of the mass distributions are quite different in these two formalisms .",
