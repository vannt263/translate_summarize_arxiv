    "femtosecond cars can be employed not only for direct imaging but also as a tool to determine some microscopic and macroscopic parameters , such as molecular anharmonicity@xcite and temperature@xcite . however , this situation creats a dilemma when the pulse bandwidth is @xmath1 1000 @xmath2 , as the nonresonant background becomes significant to possibly submerge the resonant signal and the fine vibrational structure of cars@xcite .",
    "the large nonresonant contribution affects the shape of cars spectra and complicates data analysis , which becomes an obstacle for femtosecond cars .",

    "the numerical optimal phases for maximizing @xmath95 with different @xmath92 are shown in the top panel of fig .. it is easy to see that the pareto surface of @xmath93 in the bottom panel of fig . , which is defined as the set of optimal points ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) for maximal @xmath93 with different @xmath92 , has two limit points . in the first limit",

    "ii(a ) showed the @xmath35 step phase could also eliminate the background , but it produced a relatively small resonant signal intensity @xmath111(with the same parameters as here ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath35 step phase is not a good pareto optimal solution for the optimization of @xmath93 , although it is widely used in experiments .    from the analysis above",
    ", a practical choice for @xmath92 can be made : 1 ) when @xmath112 is large ( _ i.e. _ a large background ) , it is better to choose a large value of @xmath92 , which will give a solution close to the limit point on the right side of the pareto surface ; 2 ) when @xmath112 is small , a small value of @xmath92 is appropriate .",

    "in the appendices , the following notations are used for clarity@xmath121 and @xmath122    the variational method is used to analyze all the stationary points for @xmath40 with respect to the phase function @xmath48 . the variational condition @xmath123 requires    @xmath124    from this criterion , we have    @xmath125\\right\\}\\\\ \\times i\\frac{e^{-\\frac{3\\omega_{pr}^{2}}{2\\delta^{2}}}}{\\sqrt{\\omega_{pr}^{2}+\\gamma^{2}}}\\exp \\left[i\\left(\\phi_{pr}(\\omega_{pr})+\\alpha(\\omega_{pr})\\right)\\right]]=0 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    which is equivalent to    @xmath126    so the general extremal phase functions @xmath48 for all the critical points of @xmath40 satisfy    @xmath127\\pi+\\arctan(\\omega_{pr}/\\gamma)+constant,\\ ] ] where @xmath128\\in\\{0,\\ 1\\}$ ] is the integer function of @xmath74 .",
    "it is easy to find that when @xmath128=\\mathrm{0\\ or\\ 1}$ ] , _ i.e. _ @xmath129 , then @xmath40 reaches its global maximal value . when @xmath128=\\mathrm{heaviside}(\\omega_{pr})$ ] , _ i.e. _ @xmath130 , @xmath40 has its minimal value 0 .",
    "hence , the @xmath67 _ _ _ _ phase _ _ function is the optimal solution for maximizing the peak resonant signal intensity . for the other cases of @xmath131",
    "$ ] , the phase functions are either local extremal points or saddle points .",
    "however , numerical optimization did not reveal any local extremal points , which may indicate that the control landscape@xcite for the resonant signal intensity is trap - free in this pure phase shaping strategy .",
    "a detailed proof of the trap - free landscape for cars signal needs to be investigated .",
    "for simplicity in the proof , we set @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and introduce a parameter @xmath99 , then the optimization of the objective functional                according to the expressions for @xmath17 and @xmath138 , the value of @xmath93 will not change if a trivial phase constant is added to @xmath48 .",
    "so the general solution for maximizing @xmath93 can be expressed as the sum of one special solution and a trivial phase constant . the numerical simulation in fig .",
    "shows that the optimal phase is just an odd function of @xmath74 .",
    "so @xmath48 to optimize @xmath93 just makes @xmath139 an odd function of @xmath74 and @xmath140 an even function of @xmath74 , thus"
