    "fluctuations in the ionizing intensity during reionization result in temperature and ionization fraction fluctuations .",
    "this has important implications for the reheating and reionization history of the igm .",
    "there are two contributing components :    @xmath0 igm density fluctuations ( variable optical depth )    @xmath0 spatial distribution of ionizing sources    the second point is usually addressed by computing poisson fluctuations in the ionizing intensity ( @xcite,@xcite ) . here",
    "we consider a hitherto neglected effect , the clustering of ionizing sources , and show that it is the dominant source of intensity fluctuations .",
    "we work within the framework of the concordance cosmology of @xcite:@xmath1 .",
    "we parametrise our model of reionization with 3 relevant lengthscales :    @xmath2*mean separation @xmath3 * the comoving number density of collapsed objects above a critical mass @xmath4 is given by press - schechter theory : @xmath5 , where the creation rate of dark matter halos is given in @xcite .",
    "the critical mass @xmath6 is given by the jeans mass after reheating , @xmath7 . before reheating",
    ", it is given by the virial mass necessary for efficient atomic cooling @xmath8 .",
    "the source lifetime is assumed to be @xmath9 yrs , the characteristic timescale for both starbursts and quasars .",
    "@xmath2 * attenuation length @xmath10 * this is modelled as min(@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the stromgren radius , @xmath13 is the radius of the volume ionized by a source during its lifetime , and @xmath14 is the mean free path of photons bounded by the covering factor of lyman limit systems .",
    "we assume values for the clumping of the igm computed in @xcite .",
    "the covering factor of lyman limit systems is computed by assuming a mini - halo model ( e.g.,@xcite ) , and computing their abundance via press - schechter theory .",
    "@xmath2 * correlation length @xmath15 * the evolution of the matter correlation function with redshift is given by integrating the power spectrum .",
    "we assume a linear bias model @xmath16 . given the linear bias factor @xmath17 as in @xcite , we then compute @xmath18 by assuming linear theory and thus compute a number weighted bias factor at each epoch @xmath19 : @xmath20 the high bias means that the correlation length of halos is large , even though the correlation length of matter falls with redshift .",
    "for example , @xmath21 at z=12 , which leads to @xmath22 in comoving coordinates , only somewhat weaker than the clustering of objects seen today .",
    "we also calculate the evolution of the 3 and 4 point correlation functions , assuming standard hierarchical scaling relations , @xmath23 .",
    "note that the @xmath24 , although scale invariant , are a function of bias as well .    to estimate the fluctuations in the radiation field , we conduct a monte - carlo simulation , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "we generate a mock catalog of ionizing sources in a box 150 mpc comoving size at @xmath25 .",
    "a fractal model @xcite is used to lay down sources with specified 2 , 3 & 4 point correlation functions , with appropriate modelling of the bias factors .",
    "this has the chief advantage of speed and convenience over using n - body simulations .",
    "it also does not suffer from mass resolutions effects in identifying halos .",
    "we verify that the 2 point correlation function and the 2nd , 3rd and 4th moments of counts in cells ( which are directly related to the volume - averaged correlation functions , with corrections for shot noise ) are correctly recovered .",
    "luminosity is then randomly assigned to each source , assuming a press - schechter mass function , and a constant emissivity per unit mass , as given by @xcite for their mini - quasar model . the ionizing flux at random points in the box",
    "is then computed , assuming each source ionizes out to a radius @xmath10 .",
    "we thus compute the distribution function of the ionizing flux , as well as the two point correlation function @xmath26 .",
    "clustering of ionizing sources produces a large dispersion in the luminosity of random cells . clustered sources collectively mimic an ultra - luminous source .",
    "in addition , large voids exist where no ionizing sources are present .",
    "these are ionized by the percolation of ionizing radiation .",
    "thus , large intensity fluctuations arise in the radiation field , which show coherence on large scales .",
    "this has important observational implications .",
    "emission line searches ( e.g. in ly@xmath27 and h@xmath27 ) at high redshift have a stronger signal due to the higher intensity fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , cmb fluctuations due to thomson scattering off electrons in moving ionized patches @xcite are enhanced , both due to the larger patch sizes and the spatial correlations of the ionized patches .",
    "finally , uneven reheating provides a possible biasing mechanism ."
