    "in this paper we study the dynamics of a rotating compressible fluid , taking into account such factors as non - homogeneity , and the presence of coriolis forces due to the earth rotation .",
    "the work is devoted principally to the study of one of these aspects of the problem , namely the influence of the rotation over the wave propagation in the fluid .",
    "much work has been devoted to theoretical , mathematical , and physical aspects of waves in compressible and incompressible fluids .",
    "the literature of this subject is enormous , primarily because it provides a basis for a wide range of applications and techniques , including the solution and modeling of geophysical situations , and in the theory of stars .",
    "for example the papers @xcite-@xcite , and books which discuss the fundamental equations governing waves in such fluids @xcite . more particularly , study of problems of wave propagation in a rotating compressible fluid have been the subject of several earlier publications @xcite - @xcite .",
    "some works have been devoted to the general theory of equations in stratified and rotating fluids  @xcite - @xcite .",
    "some monographs are devoted to this type of problem  @xcite - @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , with few exceptions @xcite , the systematic analtytic study of concrete non - stationary problems of wave propagation in a rotating compressible fluid have not been treated .",
    "the present line of investigation has its origin in the seminal work of s. l. sobolev @xcite .",
    "starting from the hydrodynamic equations we obtain in sec .  2 a non - classical fourth - order partial differential equation , which describes small amplitude linear oscillations in such a fluid .",
    "3 we analyse the dispersion relations for linear waves in the fluid , and discuss the different numerical regions of the group and phase velocities of the propagating waves , including their dependence on the direction of the wave vector with respect to the rotation axis of the fluid .",
    "the results obtained are potentially useful for the study of the structure of the hydrophysical fluid fields in oceans and in the earth atmosphere .",
    "consider an ideal compressible fluid that fills the whole space .",
    "we assume that the fluid rotates with constant velocity @xmath0 around a given axis .",
    "the fluid motion is refered to a system of cartesian coordinates @xmath1 which rotates with the fluid .",
    "the @xmath2 axis is directed along the rotation axis .    for such conditions , following ideas developed in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the system of hydrodynamic equations which describe the fluid is given by the following :    1 .",
    "the euler equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the vector velocity of the fluid particles , @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 is the density of the fluid , and @xmath7 is the force per unit mass acting on the fluid .",
    "2 .   the continuity equation + @xmath8 3 .",
    "the thermodynamic state equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the entropy of the fluid .",
    "if we denote @xmath11 by @xmath12 , that is to say    @xmath13    then we have    @xmath14    where @xmath12 is a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath15 has the meaning of the sound velocity in the fluid .",
    "taking into account ( [ 5 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) can be written    @xmath16    for iso - entropic motions in the fluid . in ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath7 is the coriolis force due to the rotation of the fluid .",
    "this means    @xmath17    the corresponding euler equation now becomes    @xmath18    eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) is nonlinear .",
    "therefore , the exact theory of physical processes in the fluid is nonlinear . in this paper",
    ", we study a linear approximation , and , to this end , we consider small perturbations in the fluid",
    ". we therefore linearize equation ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear term in ( [ 8 ] ) is the inertial one , @xmath19 .",
    "we let @xmath20 be the velocity amplitude , @xmath21 the frequency of the wave , and @xmath22 the wave number .",
    "then , we have    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the phase velocity of the wave .",
    "@xmath25 is a parameter of nonlinearity .",
    "we assume @xmath26 , that means that the velocity of the fluid particles on the wave is much less than the phase velocity of the wave . under these conditions",
    ", we can eliminate the inertial term and obtain    @xmath27    this equation , along with ( [ 6 ] ) , comprises the system of equations we shall study .",
    "we consider small displacements of the pressure and of the density with respect to an equilibrium values :    @xmath28    under these conditions ( [ 10 ] ) gives    @xmath29    and ( [ 6 ] ) gives :    @xmath30    by neglecting @xmath31 in these expressions , we arrive at the linearized system of equations used to describe the small - amplitude motion in the fluid :    @xmath32    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the dynamical displacement of the pressure from the equilibrium position @xmath35 . system ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 12 ] ) is a 4-equation system of first order , with 4-unknown variables , @xmath34 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , which describes the small - amplitude motion ( acoustic waves ) in the ideal rotating fluid .",
    "we will consider what we will call 2d motion in the fluid : by this we mean variation of the dynamic pressure and of the velocity for which @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the physical and geometrical points of view , these kinds of motion are possible only in domains with infinite cylindrical shape , with the generatrices parallel to the @xmath41 axis . in",
    "what follows , we suppose that the main value of the density is given by @xmath42 .",
    "then , the system ( [ 11])-([12 ] ) in the variables @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath34 becomes    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    from the system ( [ 13 ] ) - ( [ 16 ] ) it is straightforward to obtain the following equation    @xmath47 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2 } \\left [ \\frac{1}{c^2 } \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2 } - \\nabla_2 ^ 2 u + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{c^2 } u \\right ] - \\alpha^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_3 ^ 2 } = 0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 is the 2d laplacian .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) is satisfied by the pressure @xmath34 and also by the components of the velocity @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "this is a non - classical fourth order partial differential equation , which governs the waves in a rotating compressible fuid .    from ( [ 17 ] )",
    "we can see that , when @xmath49 ( which means that the fluid does not rotate ) , the operator @xmath50 has the form @xmath51 $ ] , and therefore the solution must coincide with the solution of the 2d wave equation .",
    "this allows us to conclude that , as a result of the rotation of the fluid , some terms appear in the equation that take into account the rotation .",
    "the corresponding solutions reflect this fact by their dependence on the angular velocity @xmath52 . moreover , when @xmath53 the solutions of reduce to the well - known solutions for wave propagation in a compressible medium .",
    "in what follows we shall adopt units in which @xmath54 . thus    @xmath55 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2 } \\left [ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2 } - \\nabla_2 ^ 2 u + \\alpha^2 u \\right ] - \\alpha^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_3 ^ 2 } = 0.\\ ] ]    we consider a solution of the form    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the wave vector , @xmath58 , and @xmath21 is the wave frequency . we obtain :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the angle between wave vector @xmath61 and the @xmath2 axis . eq .",
    "( [ e22 ] ) is the dispersion relation for plane waves in a rotating compressible fluid .",
    "we have :    @xmath62    we can conclude that there exists a fundamental difference between the propagation of plane harmonic waves in a rotating fluid and those in a fluid at rest . from ( [ e23 ] ) with @xmath63",
    "we obtain @xmath64 , that is to say , the well - known relation for plane waves in a fluid at rest .",
    "we note the dependence of @xmath22 on the value of angle @xmath60 ( the direction of the wave vector @xmath22 ) .",
    "two special cases are qualitatively different . in the case",
    "in which @xmath61 is parallel to the rotating axis , ( [ e23 ] ) gives @xmath64 , which means that in the @xmath2 direction plane waves with any frequency @xmath21 propagate , including step - like waves ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "when we have a wave vector @xmath61 with direction oblique to the rotation axis ( @xmath66 ) , we infer that waves propagate only for certain values of @xmath21 : there is a forbidden zone for the frequency @xmath21 , namely @xmath67 . in the case",
    "where @xmath61 is perpendicular to the rotating axis ( @xmath68 ) we have that only waves with frequency @xmath69 propagate .    by differentiating the dispersion relation ( [ e22 ] )",
    "we obtain the group velocity of the waves , thus    @xmath70    meanwhile , we know that the phase velocity of the waves is    @xmath71    from ( [ e24 ] ) we conclude the following :    1 .   for the fluid at rest ( @xmath72 ) and , hence , @xmath73 .",
    "we obtain + @xmath74 + thus the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity ; there is no dispersion , and the energy propagates in the direction @xmath61 .",
    "2 .   in general , for @xmath75 , the direction of the group velocity @xmath76 ( that is to say , the direction of propagation of the energy @xcite ) does not coincide with the direction of the vector @xmath61 , and wave dispersion takes place .",
    "when the direction of @xmath61 coincides with the rotating axis @xmath2 , i.e. when @xmath77 , for the group velocity we have    @xmath78    since @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath73 in this case .",
    "hence , the waves again propagate without dispersion .",
    "if @xmath81 , and under the propagating conditions @xmath82 , we have from ( [ e23 ] ) @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , for the group velocity , we have    @xmath84    meanwhile from ( [ e24 ] ) ,    @xmath85    this means that @xmath86 and , therefore , we have in this case a normal dispersion of the waves .",
    "this is in complete agreement with the fact that , for @xmath81 and @xmath87 the waves disperse .",
    "for @xmath88 there is a damping of waves travelling perpendicular to the @xmath2 axis direction .    in the general case",
    "we can see , using ( [ e22 ] ) , that the expresion @xmath89 in the denominator of ( [ e24 ] ) is always a positive number . from ( [ e24 ] )",
    "it follows that the group - velocity vectors , corresponding to all possible plane waves starting from the same begining , are inside the limits of a characteristic cone    @xmath90    the angle between the group vector and the rotating axis @xmath2 is    @xmath91.\\ ] ]",
    "the general behaviour of acoustic waves in a rotating compressible fluid can be described in a simple formulation using a fourth order non - classical differential equation , which reduces to the classical one when the fluid is at rest ( no rotation ) .",
    "the analysis of the dispersion relation exhibits the existence of a forbidden zone for the frequencies of the propagating wave .",
    "we have also seen that , in the presence of the non homogeneity of the space in which the waves propagate ( owing to the rotation of the fluid ) , the dispersion of the waves takes place when the wave vector is not in the same direction as the rotating axis . in future work",
    "we shall study fundamental solutions of the basic equation ( [ 17 ] ) for several interesting problems involving the diffraction of waves at walls within a rotating fluid .",
