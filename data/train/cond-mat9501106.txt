    "as announced in a paper by von klitzing , dorda , and pepper ( 1980 ) , klaus von klitzing discovered that under certain experimental conditions the hall conductivity @xmath0 of a quasi - two - dimensional electron gas is quantized to a high precision in integer multiples of @xmath1 while at the same time the longitudinal conductivity @xmath2 vanishes .",
    "a remarkable aspect of this integer quantum hall effect ( qhe ) is that the quantization exists over a finite range of physical parameters , like the magnetic field @xmath3 or the carrier concentration @xmath4 .",
    "this observation can not be explained by the semiclassical drude theory of conductivity .",
    "if the longitudinal conductivity @xmath2 vanishes the drude result for the hall conductivity is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the filling factor . only if @xmath7 is an integer , i.e. , if the fermi level lies exactly between two landau levels , is the hall conductivity quantized .",
    "laughlin ( 1981 ) , aoki and ando ( 1981 ) , and halperin ( 1982 ) showed that the hall conductivity takes on its quantized value @xmath8 over a finite range in filling factor around @xmath9 if in that range the states _ at _ the fermi energy are localized . by the same argument , when the hall conductivity is quantized there are states _ below _ the fermi energy that are _ not _ localized .",
    "the width of the quantized plateaus then depends on the ratio of localized vs.  extended states .",
    "the concept of localized states in disordered systems was developed by anderson ( 1958 ) .",
    "he showed that if a quantum - mechanical system is sufficiently disordered , states have a finite probability to return to a given site in the long - time limit .",
    "this absence of diffusion implies that these states are localized in a finite region of space .",
    "the transmission probability decays exponentially on a length scale , which is called the localization length . for localized states the static conductivity vanishes at zero temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "if the disorder is weak enough extended states might exist that do not decay exponentially and fill the whole system .",
    "their contribution to the conductivity is finite even at zero temperature .",
    "the energy that separates extended from localized states is called the mobility edge . at the mobility edge",
    "the character of eigenstates is different from both extended and localized states and we will call these states critical states .",
    "the observation that an explanation of the qhe involves both extended and localized states was the more unanticipated as the scaling theory of localization ( wegner , 1976 ; abrahams _ et  al . _ , 1979 ; wegner , 1979 ) predicted the absence of extended states in two - dimensional systems .",
    "it is the presence of a strong magnetic field that leads to the emergence of nonlocalized states in two dimensions ( ono , 1982b ) .",
    "chalker ( 1987 ) showed that these states exist only at a single energy in the limit that scattering between landau levels can be neglected . at zero temperature",
    "the hall conductivity is thus expected to exhibit sharp steps whenever the fermi energy passes the critical energy .",
    "the longitudinal conductivity vanishes for all energies except at the critical energy .",
    "the quantum hall plateau transition is thus a special case of a metal - insulator transition .",
    "the insulating phases correspond to the plateau regions , in which @xmath2 vanishes and @xmath0 is quantized .",
    "these insulating phases are separated by mobility edges with a finite @xmath2 .",
    "truly metallic phases are absent in the quantum hall system .",
    "the states at the mobility edge show critical fluctuations ( wegner , 1980 ; aoki , 1983 ; aoki , 1986 ) .",
    "the description of this localization  delocalization transition in terms of a zero - temperature phase transition is the topic of this review .",
    "we will focus on the theory of noninteracting electrons .",
    "thus we do not consider the fractional qhe ( tsui _ et  al .",
    "_ , 1982 ) , where the quantization of the hall conductivity in rational fractions of @xmath1 is due to electron - electron interactions .",
    "one notes , however , that experimentally the fractional quantum hall transitions show a remarkable similarity to the integer transitions ( see sec .",
    "[ cha : exp ] ) . in the absence of an analytical theory that is capable of providing quantitative results we will mostly rely on numerical simulations .",
    "the review is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ cha : exp ] we shortly survey the experimental investigations of the quantum hall transitions .",
    "section [ cha : model ] discusses the different models of disorder used in theoretical calculations .",
    "section [ cha : scaling ] provides an overview of the finite - size scaling theory .",
    "section [ cha : ft ] outlines the description of the anderson transition in terms of a field theory and its extension to the quantum hall system .",
    "sections [ cha : loclen ] and [ cha : others ] explain which physical quantities are used in numerical finite - size scaling studies and how they are computed . in sec .",
    "[ cha : num ] the results of numerical calculations are presented and analyzed in terms of the finite - size scaling theory . in sec .",
    "[ cha : multi ] we characterize the critical states using a multifractal analysis . in sec .",
    "[ cha : conc ] we compare the experimental and theoretical results presented in the previous sections and discuss their implications for an understanding of the quantum hall transition . except where noted otherwise we try to provide enough detail to allow the reader to use this review as a starting point for own investigations of the subject .    a comprehensive introduction to the qhe",
    "is provided in the book edited by prange and girvin ( 1987 ) . for reviews about disordered electronic systems and localization",
    "see thouless ( 1974 ) , lee and ramakrishnan ( 1985 ) , and kramer and mackinnon ( 1993 ) .",
    "in this section we want to review experimental investigations of the transition between plateaus in the hall conductivity .",
    "we will focus on those results that are uniquely related to these phase transitions .",
    "in later sections we will show how a simple scaling theory for the integer quantum hall transitions accounts for most of the observed features .",
    "we will therefore postpone the discussion of the experimental results until we are familiar with the necessary theoretical framework ( sec .",
    "[ cha : conc ] ) .    the sections [ sec : temp ] to [ sec : freq ] are ordered roughly chronologically .",
    "we will start with experiments on the temperature dependence of the transition . although these experiments give the most indirect information about the scaling behavior they were the first to be performed and instrumental in developing the idea that the plateau transitions are continuous phase transitions .",
    "much more direct contact with the concept of finite - size scaling is made in experiments with varying sample sizes .",
    "finally , the dynamic aspects of the transition are elucidated in high - frequency experiments .      soon after the discovery of the qhe ( von klitzing _",
    "et  al . _ , 1980 )",
    "it became apparent that the quantized plateaus can become extremely broad and the transition between them extremely sharp as the temperature was lowered ( kawaji and wakabayashi , 1981 ; paalanen _ et  al .",
    "_ , 1982 ) .",
    "at the same time the longitudinal conductivity exhibits a series of sharp spikes at the position of the plateau transitions .",
    "since the fermi energy is in a region of localized states when the hall conductivity is quantized and the longitudinal conductivity vanishes , it can be concluded from the wide plateaus that most of the electronic states are localized at low temperatures .",
    "paalanen , tsui , and gossard ( 1982 ) estimated that in an algaas / gaas heterostructure at 50 mk 95% of the states in each landau level are localized .",
    "the temperature dependences of the longitudinal conductivity @xmath2 and the hall conductivity @xmath0 of a si - mosfet are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_dep ] . even in the absence of localization",
    "the temperature dependence of the fermi - dirac distribution leads to a temperature dependence of the conductivity , @xmath10 if @xmath11 is finite only in an interval of width @xmath12 near the center of each landau band , eq .",
    "( [ sigma_fd ] ) predicts an increase of @xmath2 in the band center with decreasing temperature as long as @xmath13 .",
    "this increase is seen in the peaks of fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_dep ] .    when plotting @xmath2 versus @xmath0 as a function of temperature and filling factor striking features appear . the data for a si - mosfet for temperatures between 0.35 k and about 1 k in fig .",

    "the effect of the fermi distribution is still visible in the increase of @xmath2 .",
    "by contrast , the conductivities seem to be independent and follow a two - parameter scaling flow in the temperature driven flow diagram for an ingaas - inp heterostructure in fig .  [",
    "fig : two_scale_pu ] . in both figures a flow towards @xmath14 , corresponding to the widening plateaus , is obvious .",
    "kravchenko and pudalov ( 1989 ) and kravchenko _ et al . _",
    "( 1990 ) studied si - mosfet and algaas / gaas heterostructures and observed both types of behavior depending on the filling factor .",
    "a single curve was also obtained by mceuen _",
    "( 1990 ) in a study of the non - local transport properties in high - mobility gaas - algaas samples .",
    "it is experimentally extremely difficult to obtain reliable flow - diagrams close to the transitions at half - integer hall conductivity .",
    "as the temperature approaches zero the transition regions become very narrow and inhomogeneities in the electron density will let the transition happen at slightly different values of the magnetic field in different parts of the sample . since @xmath2 and @xmath0 are measured on different parts of the sample this will lead to irregular behavior near the transition .",
    "wei , tsui , paalanen , and pruisken ( 1988 ) avoided this problem by studying the critical behavior of each component of the resistivity tensor separately .",

    "this means that another mechanism is necessary to describe the dynamics of the system .",
    "it has been argued by polyakov and shklovskii ( 1993 ) and by lee , wang , and kivelson ( 1993 ) that the coulomb interaction between the electrons gives rise to @xmath70 .",

    "so far , there exists no direct experimental evidence for the multifractal structure of eigenfunctions at the transition .",
    "since the multifractality leads to an anomalous behavior of the density - response function signatures of multifractality might be observable in the temperature dependence of transport processes ( chalker and daniell , 1988 ; brandes _",

    "the numerically determined critical exponent @xmath602 agrees well with experimental results .",
    "in addition to the relevant scaling field driving the transition an irrelevant scaling field is observed in the numerical simulations .",
