    "the constituents of the dark matter observed in galactic halos are , to date , unknown .",
    "gravitational microlensing experiments , macho and eros , have detected several unexplained events in the direction of the magellanic clouds ( machos ) ( alcock@xcite , renault @xcite , palanque - delabrouille -etal @xcite ) .",
    "their combined results limit macho masses in the range @xmath11m@xmath12 to be less than 20% of the halo ( alcock @xcite ) .",
    "a standard interpretation of the microlensing results is that perhaps 30% of the galactic halo is composed of objects of mass roughly @xmath13 ( alcock @xcite ) , but this interpretation has several problems : hubble deep field star counts ( bahcall @xcite , graff & freese @xcite ) and an extrapolation of parallax data ( dahn @xcite ) suggest that faint stars ( 0.08@xmath14 - 0.2@xmath14 ) and brown dwarfs ( @xmath15 m@xmath12 ) contribute negligibly to the galactic halo ( @xmath161% of the halo mass)(graff & freese @xcite ; mera , chabrier & schaeffer @xcite ; gould , flynn & bahcall 1998 ) .",
    "gyuk , evans & gates @xcite have also argued that the macho lenses can not be a halo or spheroid population of brown dwarfs .",
    "stellar remnants might make possible macho candidates ; they have the right mass and are dark , but they also have their problems : fields , freese , and graff ( @xcite ) extrapolated the galactic population of machos to cosmic scales and found a mass density that is comparable to the cosmic baryon density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis ; this result is independent of the nature of the machos . if the machos are stellar remnants , then the additional mass density of the gas left over from the progenitors becomes a problem : virtually all of the baryons of the universe have to be recycled through the machos and their progenitors . over - pollution is difficult to avoid if these stellar remnants make up a significant fraction of the dark matter in galactic halos .",
    "it is problematic to hide the gas and/or metals ejected during the formation of the remnants ( gibson and mould @xcite ; fields @xcite ) . if carbon and nitrogen do not leave the stars , as suggested by chabrier ( @xcite ) , then the pollution is less problematic , although helium is still very restrictive ( fields , freese , and graff @xcite ) .",
    "these problems of baryonic mass budget and chemical overproduction are particularly severe for higher mass progenitors that give rise to neutron stars ( venkatesan , olinto & truran @xcite ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ we constrain stellar remnant baryonic dark matter by examining the infra - red radiation that is emitted during the evolution of the remnants progenitors while on the main - sequence and during the subsequent red giant phase .",
    "this diffuse infra - red background ( dirb ) contributes to the opacity of multi - tev @xmath0-rays allowing observations of tev gamma ray sources to limit the dirb ( gould & schrder @xcite , stecker , de jager & salamon @xcite , macminn & primack @xcite ) .",
    "hegra ct1 detections of multi - tev @xmath0-rays from the blazar mkn501 ( bradbury @xcite ) suggests that the universe is optically thin to 10 tev @xmath0-rays out to @xmath3 and thus limits the dirb ( funk @xcite ) .",
    "we use this multi - tev @xmath0-ray horizon to constrain the dirb expected from remnant halos .",
    "we show that the contribution of remnants to baryonic halo dark matter must be @xmath17 where @xmath5 is the hubble constant in units of 70 km s@xmath6mpc@xmath6 and @xmath18 is the density of stellar remnants in units of the critical density @xmath19 .",
    "note that the existing constraints on the dirb obtained by measuring the infrared background directly with dirbe ( hauser 1995 ) , iras ( boulanger and perault 1988 ) , and other experiments are weaker than the constraints obtained by hegra for the energy range of interest .",
    "the universe appears to be optically thin to multi - tev @xmath0-rays out to a redshift of ( at least ) @xmath20 based on the detection of two blazars , mkn421 ( @xmath21 ) and mkn501 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "neglecting self - absorption , the dominant source of opacity for multi - tev @xmath0-rays ( energy @xmath22 ) is pair - creation off diffuse background photons ( energy @xmath23 ) which has a threshold of    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the relative photon scattering angle in the rest frame of the microwave background , @xmath26 is the observed source photon energy measured in tev , and we have fixed @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 cross section is bethe - heitler and is plotted in figure 1 : @xmath29},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the thomson cross section .",
    "as discussed below , we will be able to place limits on the dirb in the energy range where the cross section is large , @xmath32 ev . the optical depth @xmath33 at observed source energy @xmath34 out to redshift @xmath35 due to a comoving background spectrum @xmath36 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 and for a flat universe , @xmath39^{-1/2}$ ] with @xmath40 the hubble parameter , @xmath41 the present matter density and @xmath42 the present cosmological constant energy density in units of @xmath43 .",
    "note that for sources at z=0.03 , the value of @xmath42 is irrelevant to the results .",
    "in order to determine the dirb produced by the progenitor stars of remnant machos , we start with stellar models of intermediate mass , @xmath44 , and low metallicity , @xmath45 , generated specifically for this project .",
    "the models use the nuclear reaction cross - sections of bahcall , bau & pinsonneault ( 1998 ) .",
    "the equation of state is fully ionized in the interior , and the model uses the saha equation at low temperatures ( guenther , demarque , kim & pinsonneault 1992 ) .",
    "we used the model opacities of alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) for @xmath46 , and opal opacities for higher temperatures ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) .",
    "we assumed grey atmospheres , as is appropriate for these high temperature models .",
    "our models ran from zero age main sequence ( zams ) to he core exhaustion .    for comparison , girardi ( 1996 )",
    "have also produced models for low z isochrones , and find results that are very similar ; the similarity suggests that our models are theoretically robust .",
    "girardi claim that the post he core burning lifetime of the star is of order 0.3% of the main sequence lifetime , and can thus be ignored here .",
    "our models contain no convective overshoot , and so conservatively underestimate the total light emitted by stars . were we to follow the convective overshoot system of girardi ( 1996 ) , we would expect stars to live aproximately 20% longer , emit a total of 20% more light , and thus our limits would be 20% more restrictive .",
    "in addition to the @xmath45 models discussed above , we also examined models with @xmath47 and with zero metallicity .",
    "we found no substantive changes in the stellar models , with the following exception : for progenitors at the high mass end ( 9@xmath14 ) , stars of the _ extremely _ low metallicity of @xmath47 gave similar results to the low @xmath48 models ; however , stars of strictly zero metallicity actually never evolved off the main sequence and produced about half as many infra - red photons as the low metallicity models .",
    "although our limits would then be only half as severe , such a scenario of all of the stars having not even the merest whiff of metallicity is probably academic .",
    "note that the mass range of our stellar models , @xmath49 , covers all the allowed white dwarf progenitors as well as some low mass neutron star progenitors .",
    "remnant masses are taken from the models of van den hoek & groenewegen ( @xcite ) .",
    "stars below @xmath50 would leave remnants so bright that they would have been detected already ( graff , laughlin & freese @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar models for stars above @xmath51 are not considered as reliable as those for lower mass stars .",
    "in addition , as mentioned in the introduction , fields ( 1998 ) showed that the mass budget and chemical abundance problems are particularly severe for the highest mass progenitors that give rise to neutron stars .",
    "we model the spectrum of light emitted by a star at a particular stage of stellar evolution as a black body spectral shape characterized by the effective temperature of the star . unless there are features in the stellar photon spectrum that are much broader than the width of the cross section ( as a function of infrared photon energy ; the width @xmath52 )",
    ", the optical depth is fairly insensitive to the spectral shape and is largely determined by the total number of photons with energy above @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . any spectral features , even broad absorption bands , will have only a minimal effect on the optical depth .",
    "if anything , realistic spectra would show absorption at the ultraviolet end and re - emission of the same energy as more photons at the infrared end ( see further discussion of this point below ) .",
    "thus , a black body spectrum conservatively underestimates the number of photons produced by a star .",
    "stars emit almost all their total energy during two distinct stages of evolution , main sequence ( ms ) and helium core burning ( hb ) .",
    "all other stages of stellar evolution are much too short lived or too dim to be significant in the total energy budget .",
    "thus , we approximate the total energy emitted by a star as the sum of two black bodies each marked by an average effective temperature @xmath54 and a total emitted energy @xmath55 .",
    "these two quantities are determined by integrating over the stellar models as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the effective temperature as a function of time , and @xmath58 the luminosity .",
    "we summarize the stellar parameters adopted in table 1 , where we have given the initial mass of the progenitor , the remnant mass , the average effective temperatures of the main sequence @xmath59 and helium core burning phases @xmath60 , and the log of the corresponding total emitted energies of the two phases .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table 1 : stellar parameters from our model    the total number of photons emitted by a single star at energy @xmath61 can thus be taken as the sum of the number produced by blackbody emission by the ms and rg phases , @xmath62 note that this equation has been normalized by requiring that @xmath63 we then integrate over the redshifts at which the radiation is emitted .",
    "the co - moving number density of white dwarfs is @xmath64 .",
    "thus we find that the co - moving number density of background photons with present day energy @xmath61 is @xmath65",
    "since there is no observed break in the hegra gamma ray spectrum from mkn 501 at redshift z=0.034 ( funk @xcite ) , we can conservatively conclude that @xmath66 out to z=0.034 . using equations ( [ tau ] ) and ( [ n ] ) , we can then constrain the mass density of white dwarfs due to the infrared emission by their progenitors . as mentioned previously ,",
    "we consider a variety of progenitor masses in the range ( 2 - 9)@xmath14 .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "1 shows that we can obtain upper limits on the infrared photon density over the energy range @xmath67 ev , where the cross section for interaction is sizable ( this range would be extended for a hard spectrum ) . for each progenitor mass ,",
    "we vary the gamma ray energy in the observed range ( 1 - 10 ) tev to find the largest resultant value of optical depth @xmath68 .",
    "[ note that the gamma ray energy @xmath34 is inversely proportional to the range of affected infrared photons ( c.f .",
    "( 1 ) ) . ]",
    "we also consider a variety of redshifts at which the stellar light is emitted .",
    "our limit in eqn .",
    "( 8) below applies to progenitor stars created at @xmath69 , but with some decreased sensitivity to stars in the mass range ( 3 - 4)@xmath14 created at @xmath70 .",
    "stars absorb photons above the balmer cutoff at 0.5 ev , so that these photons are not available to scatter with the tev gamma rays from mkn 501 . at @xmath71 , the balmer cuttoff at 0.5 ev passes the threshold of a 10tev photon at 0.03 ev ; thus no light emerges from the star that can scatter with the tev gamma rays .",
    "since 2@xmath14 stars emit most of their light just to the red of the balmer cuttoff , we will not see the light from these stars emitted at @xmath70 .",
    "however , a low metallicity 2@xmath14 star will live for 600 myr ( assuming no convective overshoot ) , whereas the universe at @xmath71 is only 150@xmath72 myr old .",
    "thus , even if a 2@xmath14 star is created at very high redshifts , it will emit most of its light after @xmath71 .",
    "a @xmath73 mass star will be hot enough in its main sequence phase to emit much light at energies higher than the balmer cutoff ; we will see light from that star out to z=60 , the redshift at which the lyman cutoff is redshifted below 0.03 ev .",
    "there is still a small hole of decreased sensitivity to stars in the mass range @xmath74 created at @xmath75 because of the absorption of light blueward of the balmer cutoff ; these stars are shorter lived than the 2@xmath14 stars and do emit a significant amount of their light within 150 myr of their formation .",
    "we do not expect any significant amount of baryonic objects to form before @xmath76 ( tegmark @xcite ) .",
    "combining equations ( [ tau ] ) and ( [ n ] ) , we find a robust limit of @xmath77    since our limit depends on the number density of photons , which does not vary with redshift , and since we are sensitive to a large range of energies , our limit on @xmath78 is not sensitive to the redshift at which the stellar light is emitted ( except for the decreased sensitivity discussed above for @xmath70 and ( 3 - 4)@xmath14 ) .",
    "in addition , the limit is relatively insensitive to the star formation rate and to the initial mass of the progenitor star ( with stellar mass between 2 and 9 @xmath14 ) .",
    "the limits quoted above represent the full range of limits found for any star formation rate , initial mass function , and formation redshift within the broad bounds described above .",
    "the key variables that govern the severity of the limits are : higher mass stars give slightly more severe limits , and a `` burst '' star formation rate , which concentrates the emitted light within a narrow range of redshifts @xmath79 will give more severe limits ( for the burst , no photons redshift out of the testable energy range ) .",
    "one possible way to escape this limit is dust .",
    "it is possible that the progenitor stars are so enshrouded by dust that little of their light escapes , and if the dust is cool enough , that the light is re - radiated away at too long a wavelength to interact with the tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "such a situation is most likely at high redshifts , where the dust could absorb the uv photons that later ( by z=0.034 ) would have been redshifted into the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "however , at lower redshifts ( @xmath80 ) , dust could actually make the limits stronger : dust could absorb uv photons and reradiate them in the ir , causing much more absorption in the dirb .",
    "dust absorbtion is very model dependent , depending on the type of dust , the dust geometry and temperature , and beyond the scope of this work .",
    "our result constrains the cosmological abundance of stellar remnants .",
    "the microlensing experiments have only detected machos around a single galaxy , the milky way . however ,",
    "if we assume that the milky way is not a special galaxy , and that other , similar galaxies also have their coterie of halo machos , then the universe should be filled with machos .",
    "dalcanton ( @xcite ) searched directly for a cosmological population of machos by looking for a signal of amplification of continuum emission of qso s at high redshift .",
    "the fact that they did not find such an amplification allowed them to constrain all compact objects ( not just remnants ) in the mass range @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "fields ( 1998 ) examined the cosmic abundance of machos .",
    "they found that a simple extrapolation of the ( supposed ) galactic population of machos to cosmic scales gives a cosmic density @xmath83 here @xmath84 is the fraction of galaxies that contain machos . to obtain an estimate of a lower limit to @xmath84 under reasonable assumptions , they considered the limiting case where only galaxies within one magnitude of the milky way ( i.e. , @xmath85 contain machos , and only spiral galaxies contain machos , and found @xmath86 .",
    "we consider these two results , the limit from dalcanton and eq .",
    "( [ cosmic ] ) , to be the most robust since they apply to all possible machos , and not just stellar remnants .",
    "fields , freese & graff ( 1998 ) also placed a much stronger limit on the cosmological density of stellar remnants by noting that the early universe had a low carbon and/or nitrogen enrichment . using low metallicity stellar yields of van den hoek and groenewegen ( @xcite ) , they found that only about 10@xmath87 of all baryons can have passed through the white dwarf progenitors , i.e. , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the cosmic baryon density .",
    "however , as noted by chabrier ( 1999 ) , this limit depends on the carbon yields of zero metallicity intermediate mass stars .    our new limit in eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) , based on the dirb , is less general than limits on all machos , but more robust than the carbon limit placed by fields ( 1998 ) : although the carbon yields may be uncertain , intermediate mass stars certainly do produce light .",
    "our new limit applies to remnants with any initial mass function ( between 2 and 9@xmath14 ) and any star formation rate ( with a somewhat less restrictive limit for light emitted at @xmath75 and for @xmath90 ) , and is thus extremely model independent .",
    "we can compare our new limit in eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) with the extrapolation of the milky way abundance of machos placed by fields ( 1998 ) in eq .",
    "( [ cosmic ] ) .",
    "if all galaxies contain machos in the same abundance as the milky way does , then the machos can not be stellar remnants ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "of course , it is impossible to place limits on the nature of the milky way halo based only on cosmological limits : the milky way could be the only galaxy in the universe to have machos .",
    "still , based on this work , we can say that there must be some galaxies whose halos are not dominated by white dwarfs .",
