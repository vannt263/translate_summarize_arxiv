    "several recent efforts have been done in order to understand the subyacent dynamics in electoral systems and opinion formation @xcite , from the contrarian effect@xcite to the , so called , small world behavior@xcite . in the brazilian elections , for instance , power law was found for the proportional vote@xcite .",
    "however , to establish a proper description of an electoral process is a hard issue since many factors and interactions appear and several aspects of them must be studied",
    ". statistical characterization of actual processes is an important issue as well , mainly with the increasing possibility of obtaining the vote data . in the present work",
    "we incorporate the analysis on the corporate vote with a study on the statistical properties of the federal mexican elections of 2000(e-2000 ) , 2003(e-2003 ) , and 2006(e-2006 ) . since their distributions are smooth , the existence of an analytical distribution that describes them and a model which explains them , are very tempting issues .",
    "we were successful in the first topic but the answers to the second remain open .",
    "we find a remarkable well fit of the properly unfolded distribution of votes with a family of distributions obtained in the context of spectral statistics of complex quantum systems , the called daisy models  @xcite .",
    "the process presented here is different from those that appears in @xcite , for instance , since the vote decision is taken due to pertain to a corporate .    in the referred electoral processes",
    "two new features appeared : i ) the party who ruled for around @xmath2 years@xcite became opposition and ii ) the vote data are public and in an electronic format@xcite .",
    "the last fact allows an extense statistical analysis , meanwhile , the former one gave the opportunity to analyze the vote distribution of the hard core or corporate voters .",
    "we shall denote this party as p2 according to the place in which it appears in the data basis@xcite .",
    "here we present the vote distribution of this party during the elections 2000 , 2003 , and 2006 for the president position and places in both chambers .",
    "this distribution consist of the histogram of the number of votes per cabin obtained for each party , i.e. , in how many cabins exists @xmath3 vote , @xmath1 votes and so on .",
    "the crude data histograms are presented in the next section , and the unfolding procedure together with the theoretical distribution appear in section [ unfolding ] followed by some remarks and conclusions .",
    "in a recent analysis of the mexican election of 2006@xcite the distributions of votes for all the participants were done with data obtained from the preliminary results program ( prep ) .",
    "for the two main parties the results are unclear and a mix of processes is expected ; meanwhile for the rest of the forces clear distributions appear : power laws for small parties , annulled votes and non - registered candidates , and a smooth distribution for the third electoral force .",
    "the corporate party p2 present a histogram with a clear maximum and a tail with exponential decay . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) the histograms of the official final results for p2 are presented .",
    "the data were obtained from the electoral authorities web page @xcite and on request @xcite . by construction ,",
    "each cabin admits only @xmath4 votes from the registered list of voters and they are distributed over all the country being a sample grid on the population aged over @xmath5 years old@xcite . as an exception",
    ", there exist special cabins for voters in transit but the number of them is small and do not affect the statistical results presented here",
    ". with those remarks , it is clear that the histograms are statistics .",
    "the analysis of the link with the geo - economic regions is beyond of the present work but it is of interest .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) and  [ fig:1](c ) the histograms for presidential ( red ) , deputies ( black ) and senators ( blue ) for e-2000 ( upper panel ) and e-2006 ( lower panel ) are presented and the intermediate elections for the low chamber in e-2003 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) in violet ) .",
    "we present the crude data with no average of any sort .",
    "other parameters of the distributions are presented in table [ table:1 ] being the total number of cabins considered in each process the following : @xmath6 for e-2000 , @xmath7 for e-2003 and @xmath8 for e-2006 .",
    "the existence of a smooth distribution that fits the data is a very tempting issue and is the matter of the rest of the present work .    .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a direct comparison with any probabilistic distribution requires of proper normalization and unfolding of the signal , i.e. separate the secular part from the fluctuating one . to consider this procedure is important since in many cases considering the relative variable @xmath9 is not enough because the average @xmath10 could not be constant through the whole set of data . in general , the unfolding procedure is a very delicate task @xcite . in the present case no _ a priori _ density can be defined , since it is not clear if the alphabetical order in which the data basis is ordered corresponds to the dynamics of the system . to test the fitting ,",
    "two sorts were considered , the original order and a randomly sorted sequence of the votes . in both cases",
    "the histograms are similar but the last one gives much more stable results after the unfolding procedure , as we shall discuss below .    in order to fit the experimental data with a probability distribution we treat the number of votes @xmath11 as if they were differences of energies in a quantum spectrum . as in the case of energy levels",
    ", we consider the spectrum,@xmath12 , formed by levels @xmath13 where @xmath11 is the number of votes in the cabin @xmath14 and we define @xmath15 .",
    "it is costumary to consider the integrated spectral function or integrated density @xmath16 , which counts the number of levels @xmath17 with value equal or less that @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 stands for the heaveside unitary step function .",
    "the integrated density is decomposed into a secular @xmath20 and a fluctuating part @xmath21 .",
    "the former part is given by the integral of the correlation function of one point ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for explanation ) .",
    "the sequence @xmath17 is mapped onto the numbers @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "the new variable is the unfolded one which has a constant density and the statistical analysis is performed on it . in the case of quantum systems",
    "@xmath20 is estimated applying semiclassical rules .",
    "the first term of its expansion is called , in the literature , the thomas - fermi estimate or , the weyl term in the case of billiards . in practical situations",
    "this function is evaluated via polynomial fitting .",
    "the last procedure described was done in the present case since it is the standard in many fields of physics and it is of general applicability .",
    "the specific statistic that we analyze corresponds to the nearest neighbor spacing , @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25 and is the unfolded version of the number of votes @xmath11 defined in eq .",
    "( [ intvote ] ) .",
    "the results for the unfolded votes @xmath26 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:3 ] for the deputies , president and senators in 2000 and 2006 elections . for sake of clarity",
    "we drop the e-2003 analysis .",
    "the theoretical comparison is made with the daisy model of rank @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "this model departs from retaining each @xmath0 level from a set of levels with a poisson distribution .",
    "the resulting sequence has the @xmath0-nearest neighbor distribution of poisson s , but it must be renormalized in order to obtain the nearest neighbor distribution of the daisy model of rank @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting @xmath28-th neighbor spacing distribution is @xmath29n)}s^{(r+1)n-1}\\exp[-(r+1)s ] .",
    "\\label{rdaisy}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 corresponds to the kind or rank of the family .",
    "the rank @xmath30 corresponds to the semi - poisson distribution which is related to the energy distribution of pseudointegrable systems@xcite and others systems at criticality@xcite like as the disordered conductor at the anderson transition @xcite . a strong relation exists between daisy models and the nearest - neighbor interaction one - dimensional coulomb gas@xcite , where the dependence in the inverse temperature @xmath31 from the later model has the same role as the rank @xmath27 in the former .    we do no have an _ a priori _ density in order to compare the vote records with the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ rdaisy ] ) .",
    "then , the present study can be done only at nearest neighbors , @xmath32 , even when an exploration to larger range correlations is extremely interesting and will be matter of future works .",
    "the model described by eq .",
    "( [ rdaisy ] ) with @xmath32 fits the unfolded p2 distribution of vote in two regions with two different daisy ranks , @xmath27 , the central part is usually fitted by a higher rank and decays with a lower one . in the case of e-2000 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) the fit is between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , but a remarkable deviation is that the experimental distributions start with a linear grow as indicated below and with the dashed line in fig .  [ fig:1](a ) .",
    "this characteristic remains after the unfolding procedure and marks a clear deviation from the @xmath35 behavior , however , if we do not consider this data , the area preservation of the distribution makes that the function with @xmath34 fits better .",
    "the decay is well fitted by a @xmath36 daisy model in all the cases , as can be seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "it is important to note that a fit to weibull / brody distribution is not good , since the decay is clearly exponential and that only happens in the poissonian case of such distribution .",
    "clearly this is not the case .    in e-2006",
    "a differential vote occurs since the presidential candidate obtains around @xmath37 less votes than p2 obtains for the chambers , as can see in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "such an event does not happens in the e-2000 process . in this case",
    ", the vote distributions for the chambers fit with a @xmath38 for the whole range , the body and the tail ( fig . [ fig:3 ] ) . for the presidential case",
    "exists a general fit with the @xmath38 for the body , but decays with a rank @xmath1 .",
    "note that the agreement for the presidential case ( red histogram ) is not as good as the other cases .",
    "the main difference in e-2000 and e-2006 is that p2 arrived to the last process with a deep internal division as was widely reported in national newspapers .",
    "an interesting remark , since the votes distribution has fit different rank of daisy models is that the parameter @xmath0 plays the role of an inverse temperature when the these models are contrasted with the statistical distributions of a @xmath3-dimensional coulomb gas with logaritmic interactions  @xcite",
    "in this work we presented an analysis of the vote distribution for one of the corporate parties ( named p2 here ) in mexico which has a wide influence in all the country since it was in the federal power for around @xmath2 years . by construction",
    "the mexican electoral system admits a straight statistical analysis since the number of cabins are defined and distributed in order that each cabin admits only @xmath4 voters .",
    "the crude p2 vote distributions look smooth ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) and , after a proper unfolding and normalization , corresponds to a probability distribution .",
    "comparison of the data with nearest neighbor daisy models of rank @xmath27 ( @xmath32 ) gives a good agreement in all the cases . in the election in 2000",
    "the agreement could be better , but the data distribution depart from a linear grow as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) with a dashed line tor guide the eye .",
    "the distributions tails follow a different daisy model rank .",
    "the dynamical meaning of these results is unclear but the agreement with a daisy model suggest the existence of universal processes therein and not just a fortuitous agreement . in ref .",
    "@xcite the daisy model of rank @xmath1 fit the distribution of distances for the quasi - optimal path in the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) .",
    "the problem consists in finding the shortest path between @xmath39 cities visiting each city just one time .",
    "it is clear that the problem presented here is of the same type .",
    "p2 have voters in each region of the country and their conform a truly wide web .",
    "how this happens is matter of future analysis , as well the existence of similar behavior in other corporate parties around the world .",
