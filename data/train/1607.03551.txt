    "minimal free resolutions and spectrahedra are central objects of study in commutative algebra and convex geometry respectively .",
    "we connect these disparate areas via real algebraic geometry and show a surprisingly strong connection between convexity properties of certain spectrahedra and the minimal free resolution of the defining ideal of the associated real variety . in the process",
    "we address fundamental questions on the relationship between nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares .",
    "in real algebraic geometry , we associate two convex cones to a real projective variety @xmath0 : the cone @xmath1 of quadratic forms nonnegative on @xmath0 , and the cone @xmath2 of sums of squares of linear forms .",
    "a recent line of work shows that convexity properties of these cones are strongly related to geometric properties of the variety @xmath0 over the complex numbers @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "we extend these novel connections into the realm of homological algebra by showing a direct link between the convex geometry of the dual convex cone @xmath3 and a well - studied property of the minimal free resolution of the defining ideal of @xmath0 , the so - called property @xmath5 ( recall that @xmath0 satisfies property @xmath5 for an integer @xmath7 if the @xmath8-th syzygy module of the homogeneous ideal of @xmath0 is generated in degree @xmath9 for all @xmath10 ) .",
    "the dual cone @xmath3 to sums of squares is naturally a spectrahedron , i.e. it is a section of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices with a linear subspace .",
    "by analogy with univariate polynomials , we call @xmath3 _ the hankel spectrahedron _ of @xmath0 .",
    "this defines the rank of an extreme ray of @xmath3 , which is just the rank of the corresponding symmetric matrix .",
    "our first main result is the following : if the hankel spectrahedron @xmath3 has an extreme ray of rank @xmath4 , then @xmath0 does not satisfy property @xmath5 .    the largest @xmath6 for which the property @xmath5 holds is known in the literature as the _ green - lazarsfeld index _ of @xmath0 .",
    "we call the smallest integer @xmath6 such that the hankel spectrahedron has an extreme ray of rank @xmath4 , _ the hankel index _ of @xmath0 . using this terminology",
    ", our first main result says that the hankel index is always at least one more than the green - lazarsfeld index .",
    "our second main result is that this inequality is in fact an equality in a wide variety of situations : for varieties ( reduced schemes ) of regularity @xmath11 , canonical models of general curves of genus at least @xmath12 , and subspace arrangements defined by quadratic square - free monomial ideals . the proofs of our two main results appear in section  [ sec : mainthm1 ] and section  [ sec : bpf ] respectively .",
    "the rest of the article is devoted to their applications to questions from real algebraic geometry , convex geometry , and real analysis .",
    "a projective variety @xmath0 has regularity two if the ideal of @xmath0 is generated by quadrics and all matrix entries in its minimal free resolution are linear forms .",
    "equivalently , @xmath0 satisfies property @xmath5 for all natural numbers @xmath7 and therefore its green - lazarsfeld index is infinite .",
    "it follows from our first main theorem that the hankel index of @xmath0 is infinite , i.e. all extreme rays of the hankel spectrahedron of @xmath0 have rank one and in particular @xmath13 . conversely we classify all reduced schemes @xmath0 for which the cones @xmath1 and @xmath2 coincide , i.e. for which every nonnegative quadratic form on @xmath0 is a sum of squares .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : trreg2 ] that this condition is in fact equivalent to @xmath11-regularity of @xmath0 whenever @xmath0 is totally real .",
    "this is a generalization of the work of @xcite from the case of irreducible varieties to reduced schemes .",
    "we find it remarkable that the generalization of varieties of minimal degree to reduced schemes in algebraic geometry , which are those with the smallest castelnuovo - mumford regularity , turns out to be the natural concept from the point of view of convex algebraic geometry as well .    in section  [ ssec",
    ": rank1 ] we use our results to solve a basic problem in convex geometry : classify spectrahedral cones all of whose extreme rays have rank one .",
    "we show that a spectrahedral cone @xmath14 has only rank one extreme rays if and only if @xmath14 is the hankel spectrahedron of a reduced scheme @xmath0 of regularity two .",
    "two - regular reduced schemes are completely classified in @xcite , they consist of varieties of minimal degree which are _ linearly joined _ ; see section [ sec : trreg2 ] for details .",
    "we thus obtain an explicit description of all spectrahedral cones with only rank one extreme rays .",
    "examples of such cones were studied in @xcite , but a full classification takes us inevitably into the realm of algebraic geometry .    in section  [ matrixcompl ] we recover the positive semidefinite matrix completion theorem of grone , et al . @xcite which characterizes those partial matrices for which the positive semidefinite matrix completion problem is combinatorially as simple as possible .",
    "we show its equivalence to the theorem of frberg on @xmath11-regularity of monomial ideals @xcite by recasting it as one about sums of squares on certain subspace arrangements .",
    "frberg s theorem was generalized in @xcite where it is shown that the green - lazarsfeld index of a reduced scheme @xmath0 defined by quadratic monomials is equal to the length of the smallest chordless cycle of its associated graph @xmath15 minus @xmath16 .",
    "we show the corresponding result holds for the hankel index of @xmath0 , obtaining a new extension of the positive semidefinite matrix completion theorem .",
    "it is surprising that , despite a significant amount of work in examining the extreme rays of such spectrahedra @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , this result was not observed .    in algebraic geometry",
    "we find a new characterization @xmath11-regular reduced schemes .",
    "previously @xcite characterized @xmath11-regular scheme via a geometric property of _ smallness _ ; see sections [ subsec : introbpf ] and [ subsec : bpf ] for details .",
    "we characterize @xmath11-regularity of @xmath0 in terms of properties of base - point - free linear series on @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath17 be a reduced projective scheme with graded coordinate ring @xmath18",
    ". then @xmath0 is @xmath11-regular if and only if every base - point - free linear series @xmath19 generates @xmath20 . as explained in section  [ subsec : hindex ]",
    "this characterization was motivated by our investigation of the hankel index .",
    "finally , we also discuss applications to truncated moment problems of real analysis in section [ sec : moments ] . in its simplest form",
    ", a truncated moment problem asks whether a given linear operator @xmath21 on functions on @xmath0 is the integral with respect to some borel measure .",
    "our main result is a new sufficient criterion based on the green - lazarsfeld index of @xmath0 , which is another motivation for its study .",
    "this is also of direct relevance in polynomial optimization , as it gives a new guarantee of exactness for semidefinite relaxations .      motivated by the equivalent characterizations of schemes of regularity @xmath11 established in @xcite ,",
    "there has been a considerable amount of work on the connection between property @xmath5 and a geometric property of the variety @xmath0 , which is called @xmath6-smallness ( @xmath0 is @xmath6-small if for every subspace @xmath22 of dimension at most @xmath6 for which @xmath23 is finite , @xmath24 is linearly independent ) . if @xmath0 satisfies property @xmath5 , then @xmath0 is @xmath6-small and sometimes the converse is known to hold @xcite .",
    "the key to the results in this article is the introduction of a property of base - point - free linear series on @xmath0 , which we show to be intermediate between @xmath5 and @xmath6-smallness .",
    "we say that @xmath0 has the @xmath6-base - point - free property if every base - point - free linear series of codimension at most @xmath6 generates the degree two part of the homogeneous coordinate ring of @xmath0 . as we show in theorem  [ thm : jumpnumberpbp ] , the @xmath6-base - point - free property on @xmath0 provides an obstruction for the existence of extreme rays in @xmath3 of rank @xmath6 .",
    "we think that the study of the @xmath6-base - point - free property is , in itself , an interesting problem of complex algebraic geometry .",
    "specifically we would like to have methods for deciding whether a variety @xmath0 satisfies the @xmath6-base - point - free property or a characterization of those varieties for which this property coincides with either @xmath5 or @xmath6-smallness ( see related examples in section  [ sec : bpf ] ) .",

    "<S> the dual cone @xmath3 is a spectrahedron and we show that its convexity properties are closely related to homological properties of @xmath0 . for instance , we show that all extreme rays of @xmath3 have rank one if and only if @xmath0 has castelnuovo - mumford regularity two . more generally , if @xmath3 has an extreme ray of rank @xmath4 , then @xmath0 does not satisfy the property @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the converse also holds in a wide variety of situations : the smallest @xmath6 for which property @xmath5 does not hold is equal to the smallest rank of an extreme ray of @xmath3 greater than one . </S>",
    "<S> these results allow us to generalize the work of blekherman - smith - velasco on equality of nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares from irreducible varieties to reduced schemes and to classify all spectrahedral cones with only rank one extreme rays . </S>",
    "<S> our results have applications to the positive semidefinite matrix completion problem and to the truncated moment problem on projective varieties . </S>"
