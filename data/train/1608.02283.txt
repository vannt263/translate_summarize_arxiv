    "binary black holes are considered to be the foremost important sources for the emerging field of gravitational wave astrophysics .",
    "multiple black hole systems , above obvious curiosities , may also serve as exotic gravitational waves sources .",
    "investigation of the dynamics of these systems requires a judicious initialization .",
    "this may be done by the standard elliptic method @xcite ( see also @xcite ) or either of the recently introduced evolutionary approaches @xcite that are complementary to the standard one .",
    "recently , the parabolic - hyperbolic formulation of hamiltonian and momentum constraints , along with superposing individual kerr - schild black holes , was applied to construct initial data for binary black hole configurations @xcite . this construction does also apply to multiple black hole systems comprised by black holes with initial speeds parallel to a plane in some background euclidean space provided that their spins are also orthogonal to that plane . as there are no restrictions on the masses , speeds , spins and distances of the individual black holes",
    "this set contains a great number of systems of physical interest . for this class of configurations",
    "an argument claiming the existence and uniqueness of @xmath2 solutions to the parabolic - hyperbolic form of the constraints is outlined in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "a different strategy will be applied .",
    "we shall consider a set of generic individual kerr - schild black holes , each located momentarily on a plane in some background euclidean space but the orientation of their speeds and spins will not be restricted . by adopting constructive elements of the proposal in @xcite , we shall choose the free data to the initial - boundary value problem , derived from the parabolic - hyperbolic form of the constraints , using the metric yielded by superposing kerr - schild black holes . note that in case of widely separated generic kerr - schild black holes solutions to the initial - boundary problem are expected to differ only slightly from the individual black holes solutions , whence it is highly plausible that in these cases the craved global solutions exist .",
    "nevertheless , as the verification of the basic result of the present paper refers only to the specific choice of the free data and it does not require the detailed knowledge of solutions , no attempt will be made here to deal with the global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the pertinent initial - boundary value problem .",
    "instead , provided that free data is chosen as proposed in @xcite , the global existence of asymptotically flat solutions to this initial - boundary value problem will simply be assumed .    as the metric ( [ eq : bks4 ] ) of superposed kerr - schild black holes is asymptotically flat @xcite  though it does not satisfy einstein s equations ",
    "it is plausible to assume that solutions to the specific initial - boundary problem will also be asymptotically flat . as a working hypothesis we shall assume this , and also that well - defined adm mass , centre of mass , linear and angular momenta can be associated with the corresponding asymptotically flat solutions .",
    "based on these assumptions , this paper is to prove that the adm quantities , characterizing initializations of the underlying multiple black hole systems , can be given  without making detailed use of the to be solutions to the constraints  in terms of the position , velocity and spin vectors of the individual black holes .",
    "this result immediately raises the question if any analogous determinacy of the adm quantities is available in other formulations of the constraints . in this respect",
    ", it should be mentioned that the method proposed by bowen and york @xcite , within the framework of conformal approach , allows to prescribe the adm linear and angular momenta by solving the momentum constraint explicitly @xcite .",
    "to do so , however , they had to apply a restricted set of basic variables .",
    "in particular , to guarantee that the hamiltonian and momentum constraint decouple they had to assume vanishing of the mean curvature while other technical ingredients required conformal flatness of the riemannian metric @xmath3 .",
    "one of the unpleasant consequences of these technical requirements is that they are known to be so strong that they exclude even the kerr black hole solution from the outset @xcite .",
    "one should also mention here that , within the setup proposed by bowen and york @xcite , there was no way to get an analogous control on the adm mass or on the centre of mass .    in context of the determinacy of the adm",
    "quantities one should also mention the construction applied in @xcite .",
    "there , by combining the gluing techniques with the use of kerr - schild black holes , an interesting initialization of multiple black hole systems was proposed .",
    "indeed , as kerr - schild black holes were applied in @xcite and our proposal also makes heavy use of the these type of black holes one would expect that analogous determinacy of the adm quantities applies to both of these approaches .",
    "it is , however , not the case as gluing require the use of the elliptic method that starts by a conformal rescaling of the basic variables . in turn , gluing gets somewhat implicit , which does not allow  except in the highly unrealistic extremal case with infinitely separated individual black holes  to have a full control on the adm quantities @xcite .",
    "yet another unfavorable consequence of the use of conformal method is that intermediate regions  where the gluing happen  have to be allocated to each of the involved kerr - schild black holes .",
    "this , however , does not allow to set the initial distances of these black holes to be arbitrary , and , as stated explicitly in @xcite , they must be separated by a distance above a certain threshold .",
    "it is important to be emphasized that our proposal does not impose analogous restrictions on the distances of individual black holes , and yet it provides a full control on the adm parameters of multiple black hole systems . as this happens in advance of solving the constraints an unprecedented fine tuning of the full set of adm parameters of the to be solutions",
    "is possible .",
    "the main result of this paper reads as follows :    [ theor]-.2 cm suppose that an asymptotically flat solution to the initial - boundary value problem  deduced from the parabolic - hyperbolic form of the constrains , ( [ bern_pde])([ort_const_n])exist such that the free data is chosen , as described in section[initial - boundary ] , by applying the superposed kerr - schild metric ( [ eq : bks4 ] ) .",
    "then , the adm mass , centre of mass , linear and angular momenta , relevant for the initialization of the corresponding multiple black hole system , can be given , as in ( [ adm_mass])([angular_momentu ] ) , in terms of the rest masses , positions , velocities and spins of the involved kerr - schild black holes .",
    "it is important to be emphasized that the argument ensuring the existence and uniqueness of @xmath2 solutions to the parabolic - hyperbolic form of the constraints for the restricted class of configurations investigated in @xcite , along with the one applied above to widely separated generic multi black holes , indicates that non - trivial multi black hole systems fitting to the assumptions of theorem [ theor ] exist guaranteeing thereby that the above hypotheses are not empty .",
    "initial data relevant for the vacuum einstein s equations is comprised by a riemannian metric @xmath3 and a symmetric tensor field @xmath4 .",
    "both of these fields are assumed to be given on a three - dimensional manifold @xmath5 .",
    "they are , however , non - generic as they have to satisfy the constraints .",
    "these , in the vacuum case  relevant also for multiple black hole configurations considered in this paper , are given as ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the scalar curvature and the covariant derivative operator associated with @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the essential steps in deriving the parabolic - hyperbolic form of these equations are as follows : assume , for simplicity , that there exists a smooth function @xmath9 such that the @xmath10 surfaces ( denoted also by @xmath11 ) provide a one - parameter family of foliation of @xmath5 .",
