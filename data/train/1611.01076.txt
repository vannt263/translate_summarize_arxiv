    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) is the primary instrument on the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ mission which was launched on 11 june 2008 . to date _",
    "lathas detected more than 200 new @xmath0-raypulsars , a dramatic increase over the 6 or 7 known at the time of _ fermi _  lat s launch @xcite .",
    "this sudden abundance of pulsars visible in both the radio and @xmath0-raybands has opened the door to multiwavelength investigations that were not possible before .",
    "these studies have , however , been made difficult by the comparatively low @xmath0-rayphoton flux ( typically ) , as compared to the radio photon flux for any particular pulsar .",
    "this disparity manifests itself in the relative uncertainties on the observed intensities in the two wavebands , making traditional goodness - of - fit techniques very ineffective when trying to fit the radio and @xmath0-raylight curves ( lcs ) simultaneously .",
    "this has led some investigators to adopt so - called by - eye methods to find optimal simultaneous fits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a number of attempts have , however , been made to address this issue directly , and this paper presents our latest such attempt .",
    "the most notable attempts to date ( @xcite ) artificially inflate the uncertainties accompanying the radio lcs in an attempt to grant the radio and @xmath0-raydata equal weight in the determination of the optimal fit .",
    "as we will show , neither of their approaches accomplish this fully",
    ". we will then describe our proposed solution using these two approaches as reference .",
    "we use an idealized picture of the pulsar system , wherein the magnetic field has a retarded dipole structure @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-rayemission originates in regions of the magnetosphere ( referred to as ` gaps ' ) where the local charge density is sufficiently lower than the goldreich - julian charge density @xcite .",
    "these gaps facilitate particle acceleration and consequently radiation .",
    "we assume that there are constant - emissivity emission layers embedded within the gaps , in the pulsar s corotating frame .",
    "the location and geometry of these emission layers determine the shape of the @xmath0-raylcs , and there exist multiple models describing their geometry . in this paper only the two - pole caustic ( tpc , @xcite ) @xmath0-raymodel will be examined . for the radio emission",
    "we use a simple empirical hollow cone model @xcite . for a more detailed description of these models ,",
    "see our previous work @xcite .",
    "[ fig : labeled ] ( left ) shows an example of a phaseplot produced using the tpc model .",
    "it is an equirectangular projection skymap of the emission of the pulsar , with rotational phase @xmath2 on the horizontal axis , and the observer s line of sight @xmath3on the vertical axis . for each point in @xmath4 space",
    "it gives the relative intensity per solid angle of the emission that would be observed if the observer s line of sight would pass through that point as the pulsar rotates .",
    "a phaseplot thus contains the projected all - sky @xmath0-rayemission of a pulsar over one complete rotation .",
    "the equator of the neutron star is at @xmath5 , and its magnetic poles are at @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus , each value of @xmath8corresponds to a unique phaseplot .",
    "[ fig : labeled ] shows an example of how a predicted lc can be obtained by cutting a phaseplot at a constant value for @xmath3(e.g .",
    ", for a pulsar with @xmath9 ) .",
    "the predicted lcs are independently normalised so their respective maxima are 1",
    ".    cuts through a phaseplot for @xmath9 .",
    "the cuts correspond to values of @xmath10 ( red ) and @xmath11 ( yellow ) .",
    "we see that the caustics on the phaseplot present as peaks in the lc .",
    "[ fig : labeled],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=44.0% ] cuts through a phaseplot for @xmath9 .",
    "the cuts correspond to values of @xmath10 ( red ) and @xmath11 ( yellow ) .",
    "we see that the caustics on the phaseplot present as peaks in the lc .",
    "[ fig : labeled],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=22.0% ] cuts through a phaseplot for @xmath9 .",
    "the cuts correspond to values of @xmath10 ( red ) and @xmath11 ( yellow ) .",
    "we see that the caustics on the phaseplot present as peaks in the lc .",
    "[ fig : labeled],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=22.0% ]",
    "the by - eye method considers the lcs associated with the entire domain of @xmath8and @xmath3by generating so - called atlases .",
    "each atlas consists of a set of predicted @xmath0-rayand radio lcs generated at each point on a grid of @xmath12values covering the @xmath12domain at a chosen resolution .",
    "the data lcs are then compared to the model lcs at each point in this grid , and a subjective decision is made regarding the quality of each fit . once the entire space has been scanned , a best - fit contour emerges , and constraints on the viewing geometry @xmath12of the pulsar can be derived .",
    "an important aspect to note is that not only are the shapes of the lcs reproduced , but also the radio - to-@xmath0 phase lag . for an example of this method s application , see our previous study @xcite .",
    "the by - eye method is not very rigorous , and would possibly yield different results when applied by different people .",
    "the results , however , do seem to be a good first attempt at finding concurrent fits when considered alongside other fits obtained independently ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , this method allows us to discern which features of the lc most likely contribute to a specific lc s rejection , which in turn gives us insight into what effects are responsible for the shape of the final solution contours .",
    "since the statistical methods aim to fit the same models ( in our case at least ) to the same data , we can use the knowledge garnered from the by - eye contours as a sanity check when considering the contours produced by the statistical methods .",
    "the statistical methods developed to date implement a modified version of pearson s @xmath1 goodness - of - fit test , with the test statistic defined as    @xmath13    with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 corresponding to the model ( expected ) intensity , observed intensity , and error ( uncertainty ) on the observed intensity for the @xmath17th bin ( of @xmath18 bins ) @xcite .",
    "this test statistic is @xmath1 distributed with @xmath19 degrees of freedom .",
    "ideally the minimum value obtained for @xmath20 ( as a function of the tested model s parameters ) will be roughly @xmath21 , indicating that there is some set of parameters for which the model fits the data well . since the current models are still only approximate representations of the actual phenomena , this unfortunately rarely occurs , with the best fits having values for @xmath22 .",
    "to compensate for this , and to allow constraints to be derived from our imperfect models , the value of @xmath20 is normalised such that its minimum is @xmath21 .",
    "this method has been applied successfully for lcs from a single waveband , but has proven to be less useful when trying to fit observed lcs from multiple wavebands concurrently . calculating the values of @xmath20 for the lcs in each waveband and naively combining them ( with equal weighting ) for each set of parameter values , yields constraints that tend to be dominated by the waveband that has lower relative uncertainties . in our case , the radio goodness - of - fit test statistic dominates the overall fit .",
    "this problem has been addressed in the methods developed thus far , but with limited success .",
    "one approach is to somehow artificially inflate the radio uncertainties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "how this is done differs depending on the method , but the results are invariably an improvement on a naive goodness - of - fit method .",
    "[ fig : johnson ] shows how these artificially inflated uncertainties look ( specifically the method used by @xcite ) , and how the resulting values of @xmath20 change .     for the combined radio and @xmath0-rayfits .",
    "the left - most of the @xmath1 maps finds its best fits along the diagonal , which means that the radio fit dominates . in the right - most @xmath1 map we see the cross - diagonal features of the @xmath0-rayfit emerging .",
    "the resulting contours become more constraining as both models start contributing more equally to the fitting process .",
    "[ fig : johnson],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]   for the combined radio and @xmath0-rayfits .",
    "the left - most of the @xmath1 maps finds its best fits along the diagonal , which means that the radio fit dominates . in the right - most @xmath1 map",
    "we see the cross - diagonal features of the @xmath0-rayfit emerging .",
    "the resulting contours become more constraining as both models start contributing more equally to the fitting process .",
    "[ fig : johnson],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the motivation behind these statistical methods is that for us to be able to add the @xmath1 profiles for the radio and @xmath0-raygoodness - of - fit tests , the values for @xmath20 associated with the best radio and best @xmath0-rayfit should be of roughly comparable size .",
    "this is best accomplished by adjusting the uncertainties of the radio lc .",
    "these methods do not work effortlessly for all pulsars , though .",
    "for some pulsars , one needs to increase the degree to which the radio uncertainties are inflated , while for others a decrease is required @xcite .",
    "this seems to indicate that there might still be room for improvement .",
    "the method we propose takes a more direct route toward obtaining comparable radio and @xmath0-rayvalues for @xmath20 .",
    "in considering the statistical methods above we realised that ensuring comparable minima for the @xmath1 maps is not sufficient as the minima will generally not be colocated in @xmath12space .",
    "stated more clearly , we realised that the minimum of the @xmath0-raytest statistic should be compatible with all the values of the radio test statistic , not just its minimum , and vice versa .",
    "this ensures that the minimum @xmath0-raytest statistic value is not averaged with a ( non - minimum ) radio test statistic value that is orders of magnitude larger , when combining the radio and @xmath0-ray@xmath1 maps , since the radio will still dominate in that case .    to accomplish this compatibility we scale the radio test statistic values such that their dynamic range ( the difference between their maximum and minimum ) is equal to that of the @xmath0-raytest statistic values . in effect",
    "we force the radio and @xmath0-raytest statistic values to carry equal weight in the determination of the best concurrent fit .",
    "this scaling is done globally over the space defined by the parameters for which we are deriving constraints .",
    "the procedure employed proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "* calculate the unscaled @xmath1 maps , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : chisq ] ) , for the radio and @xmath0-rayfits independently . * in our case each model lc has four parameters associated with it , which means these maps will have four dimensions .",
    "the lc parameters are @xmath8 , @xmath3 , @xmath23 ( zero point in phase ) , and @xmath24 ( the lc amplitude )",
    "* minimise each map over all parameters that are independent for the two wavebands . * for the concurrent fits in this study only @xmath24 can be minimised over in this step .",
    "since we assume that the radio and @xmath0-rayemission originates from different regions in the same magnetic field , the value of @xmath23 can not be varied independently , and can therefore not be minimised over in this step .",
    "the resulting maps in our case have three dimensions .",
    "* scale the @xmath0-raymap to have a minimum equal to the appropriate number of degrees of freedom @xcite . * for simplicity",
    ", we assume here that this scaled test statistic is @xmath1 distributed .",
    "4 .   * scale the radio map such that it has the same dynamic range as the freshly - scaled @xmath0-raymap . *",
    "the scaled radio test statistic is also assumed to be @xmath1 distributed , in accordance with the assumption made for the scaled @xmath0-raytest statistic .",
    "* sum the two maps .",
    "* the resulting combined map will have as many dimensions as the models have coupled parameters ( parameters that can not be varied independently ) . in our case",
    "the coupled parameters are @xmath8 , @xmath3 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom for this combined test statistic is the sum of the minima of the constituent maps @xcite .",
    "this follows from the assumption made in _",
    "( iii ) _ and _ ( iv ) _ for the two constituent maps . 6 .",
    "* minimise the combined map over all coupled parameters except @xmath8and @xmath3 . * for our study , and more generally , these two parameters are the ones for which constraints are to be derived .",
    "the resulting map therefore has two dimensions .",
    "* obtain the confidence contours using the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 values of a @xmath1 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom . *",
    "since the lowest value the minimum of the combined map can have is the sum of the minima of the constituent maps ( in the case of colocated minima ) , we can derive the contours by adding the above - mentioned @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 values to this lowest minimum @xcite .",
    "implementing this approach for the six pulsars we previously studied yields constraints that compare very well to those obtained by eye @xcite .",
    "the inclusion contours shown were derived as discussed in step _ ( vii ) _ in the previous section .",
    "they should , however , only serve as an estimation of how the actual contours may look since it is not yet clear how the actual contours should be computed .",
    "maps for the six pulsars studied in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the white , red , and green contour lines represent @xmath25- , @xmath26- , and @xmath27-like contours respectively , but should be considered cautiously .",
    "the white regions are where the radio model predicts no lc .",
    "[ fig : newresults],scaledwidth=89.0% ]",
    "the inclusion contours obtained using our proposed method compare favourably with those for the by - eye method , which in turn compare well with independently derived constraints @xcite .",
    "although the the aim of these statistical methods is not to reproduce the results obtained using the by - eye method , the results of the by - eye method serve as a sanity check which the statistical methods should pass .",
    "the @xmath1 maps produced using our method have a number of properties which may prove useful in future studies .",
    "chief among these properties is that the contours are calculated relative to a value other than the minimum of the combined map .",
    "this allows our method to reject an unsuccessful model combination even though some normalisation is done in obtaining the combined map .",
    "another useful property is that the combined map remains essentially unchanged if step _",
    "( iii ) _ is omitted , effectively only being scaled .",
    "this allows for the possibility of comparing the goodness of fit of different model combinations , and therefore identifying the most successful model combination .",
    "the interplay between our confidence in the geometric models and the uncertainties associated with the observed lcs also seems to be an important one to understand .",
    "it is useful to differentiate between evaluating which predicted lcs fit _",
    "best _ , and whether or not the observed lcs are fit _",
    "well_. for a single model , determining the goodness of fit for each possible solution not only tells us how _",
    "well _ the data is fit , but also allows us to determine which of those solutions is the _",
    "best _ fit .",
    "this correlation does not hold when we generalise our method to include multiple models and multiple datasets .",
    "the breakdown occurs because we calculate the combined test statistic as the sum of the two constituent test statistics , making it sensitive to changes in the scaling of either of the single - model test statistics . since our confidence in each model could be expressed as a scaling of the test statistic , effectively weighting their contribution to the combined test statistic , it is difficult to ensure that the single - model test statistics are properly scaled before summation .",
    "our approach to the scaling of the individual test statistics is an attempt to address this problem directly .",
    "the most important open issue in this study is how the confidence contours are to be defined .",
    "the specification given in sec .",
    "[ sec : ourmethod ] , based on the assumptions regarding the distributions associated with the radio and @xmath0-raytest statistics , still needs to be tested .",
    "we are currently developing a monte carlo simulation strategy aimed at doing this .",
    "the method derived here will also be used to compare a variety of multi - model combinations based on concurrent fitting of pulsar lcs .",
