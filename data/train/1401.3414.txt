    "in a few cerium - based compounds , hybridization of @xmath23 electrons and conduction bands ( _ c - f _ hybridization ) gives rise to a hybridization gap in the vicinity of the fermi level.@xcite because of the strong electron correlation , the energy gap is renormalized to a small value of 10 - 100 k. so - called kondo semiconductors such as ce@xmath31bi@xmath32pt@xmath31 and cerhas display semiconducting behavior in the electrical resistivity,@xcite while so - called kondo semimetals cenisn and cerhsb show semimetallic behavior.@xcite the latter behavior reflects the anisotropic gap which closes in a particular direction due to the anisotropy of the hybridization.@xcite these compounds belong to the valence fluctuating regime and do not order magnetically at low temperatures because the strong kondo interaction between the @xmath23 localized moment and conduction electron spins screens the localized moments .",

    "thereby , the change in @xmath22 is only 10% from 28.5 k to 26.5 k , suggesting that the intersite afm interaction between ce moments may not depend on the direction of @xmath16 with respect to the crystal axis .",
    "recently , a neutron scattering experiment has confirmed the reorientation of ordered moments from @xmath108 @xmath4ce for @xmath18 to @xmath109 @xmath4ce for @xmath98.@xcite similar reorientation of afm ordered moments has been suggested to occur in ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 when rh is partially substituted for ru at 5%.@xcite since both substitutions of ir for os and rh for ru dope @xmath34 electrons in the mother compounds , the spin reorientation should be induced by the doping of @xmath34 electrons into the gapped state .",

    "the log@xmath76 dependence from 300 k to 100 k is followed by a thermal activation - type behavior in the range from 60 k to 30 k as shown in the inset . by fitting the data with the formula @xmath114exp(@xmath115@xmath116 ,",

    "when the conduction electron density is increased , the spin polarization would be enhanced , leading to the increase of @xmath22 . another interesting observation in fig .",
    "7(a ) is the fact that both the suppression of @xmath22 and increase of @xmath134 value are more drastic as a function @xmath25 than as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath41 holes are doped , the fermi level is lowered toward the @xmath23 electron level .",
    "then , the _ c - f _ exchange interaction will be strengthened and the valence fluctuation will be enhanced , as found in the case of co substitution for ni in cenisn.@xcite another method to enhance the _",
    "c - f _ exchange interaction in ce based compounds is the application of pressure .",
    "a previous study of ceos@xmath0al@xmath1 under pressure showed that @xmath22 is almost constant up to @xmath137 gpa and suddenly suppressed as the pressure is further increased.@xcite it is noteworthy that the suppression of @xmath22 by pressure coincides with the metallization in @xmath29 at @xmath83 , which resembles the observation in the present experiment by doping @xmath41 holes .",

    "figure 7(b ) shows the variations of @xmath22 and thermal activation energy @xmath138 in the resistivity as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath25 .",
    "we find strong correlation between the variations of @xmath22 and @xmath138 .",

    "the valence fluctuation behavior in @xmath68 with a broad maximum at around 45 k for the undoped sample changes to the curie - weiss behavior of ce@xmath75 with increasing @xmath21 .",

    "<S> the kondo semiconductor ceos@xmath0al@xmath1 exhibits an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order at @xmath2 k , whose temperature is unexpectedly high for the small ordered moment of @xmath3 @xmath4ce . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the effects of electron- and hole - doping on the hybridization gap and afm order by measuring the magnetization @xmath5 , magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 , electrical resistivity @xmath7 , and specific heat @xmath8 on single crystals of ce(os@xmath9ir@xmath10)@xmath0al@xmath1(@xmath11 ) and ce(os@xmath12re@xmath13)@xmath0al@xmath1(@xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results of @xmath15 indicates that the afm ordered moment @xmath16 changes the direction from the @xmath17-axis for @xmath18 to the @xmath19-axis for @xmath20 . with increasing @xmath21 up to 0.15 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath22 gradually decreases although the @xmath23 electron state becomes localized and the magnitude of @xmath16 is increased to @xmath24 @xmath4ce . with increasing @xmath25 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23 electron state is more delocalized and the afm order disappears at a small doping level @xmath26 . in both electron- and hole - doped systems , the suppression of @xmath22 is well correlated with the increase of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath27 in @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the simultaneous suppression of @xmath22 and the semiconducting gap in @xmath29 at @xmath30 indicates that the presence of the hybridization gap is indispensable for the unusual afm order in ceos@xmath0al@xmath1 . </S>"
