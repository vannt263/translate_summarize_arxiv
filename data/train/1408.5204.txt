    "linear processing in the spatial domain at the base stations ( bss ) and at the users of a multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) cellular system is a well studied technique that enables the control of both inter - cell and intra - cell interference ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a number of iterative algorithms have been proposed in the past few years for the design of the linear processors that are either centralized , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein , or can be instead implemented in a decentralized way @xcite@xcite-@xcite . in the latter case , the bss and the users calculate the transmit - side and the receive - side linear processors in a distributed manner via message exchange based only on local channel state information .",
    "the distributed techniques in @xcite@xcite-@xcite differ in the information that is exchanged between the bss and users and in the processing that is carried out at the two sides .",
    "another key classification of these techniques can be done with respect to methods that apply to mimo interference channels , i.e. , cellular systems with a single user per cell , and techniques are suitable for to more general cellular systems with multiple users per cell .",
    "the interference leakage minimization ( ilm ) techniques of @xcite@xcite require the exchange of unitary matrices between the two sides and was proposed for a mimo interference channel .",
    "references @xcite@xcite generalize the ilm technique to a cellular system with an arbitrary number of users per cell , where the cells operate in either uplink or downlink .",
    "in contrast , the technique proposed in @xcite requires the exchange of additional information beside unitary matrices and applies to the downlink of a general mimo cellular system . in this regard ,",
    "we observe that the transmission of unitary matrices is facilitated by the advances in the quantization over the grassmann manifold ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and is hence desirable , making the ilm scheme of @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite potentially more viable for practical implementation .",
    "the signal plus interference leakage minimization technique ( silm ) of @xcite modifies the ilm strategy by including in the cost function , not only the interference power , but also the power of the signal that is wasted in the space orthogonal to the receive subspaces .",
    "this scheme also requires the exchange of unitary matrices and was studied in @xcite for mimo interference channels .     multi - cell uplink - downlink mimo system .",
    "downlink and uplink inter - cell interference signal paths are shown for a user in cell 1 as an example . ]    in this paper , a novel iterative strategy is proposed that generalizes silm @xcite to a mimo cellular system with an arbitrary number of users per cell and in which each cell may be operated either in the uplink or in the downlink .",
    "note that this mixed uplink - downlink configuration is known to be potentially advantageous , even in terms of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "specifically , following @xcite@xcite@xcite , the precoding matrix at the downlink - operated bss is factorized into a unitary pre - processing matrix that handles inter - cell interference and a post - processing matrix that deals with intra - cell interference .",
    "the design of precoding and receiver - side matrices is obtained as the alternating optimization solution of the problem of minimizing the weighted sum of the inter - cell interference powers and of the signal power leaked in the space orthogonal to the receive subspaces .",
    "the post - processing precoding matrices at the downlink bss are then calculated using the minimum mean square error ( mmse ) or the zero - forcing ( zf ) criteria , where the latter was considered in @xcite .",
    "numerical results validate the advantages of the proposed technique with respect to the ilm strategy of @xcite@xcite .",
