    "the conformational properties of a polymer are characterized by a collective , cooperative behavior of the monomers in response to different system conditions .",
    "the geometric constraint of an attractive substrate adds to the freezing and coil - globule transitions of a polymer in bulk solution the adsorption transition and gives rise to several phases induced by the competition between monomer - monomer and monomer - surface attraction .",
    "this behavior of grafted polymers on substrates is of manifold practical importance .",
    "ultrathin end - grafted polymer layers play a major role in adhesion , colloidal stabilization@xcite , chromatography@xcite , lubrication , microelectronics , and biocompatibility of artificial organs . to achieve the grafting , typically `` grafting from '' , `` grafting through '' or `` grafting onto '' polymerization techniques are used@xcite or diblock copolymers",
    "are physisorbed to the substrate@xcite .",
    "grafted polymer adsorption is computationally easier to handle since the phase space lacks potentially desorbed conformations some distance away from the substrate .",
    "additionally , one avoids the introduction of a hard wall parallel to the surface that is necessary to prevent the polymer from escaping but introduces a further parameter that might not always be of interest .",
    "this is probably the main reason for the prevalence of grafted polymers in the theoretical studies on polymer adsorption@xcite .",
    "also the adsorption of nongrafted polymers has been studied@xcite , but usually those works have been performed on different models which hamper the extraction of the influence of grafting on the results by comparison .",
    "it is the goal of our study to fill this apparent gap and systematically analyze and compare the phase behavior of a single grafted homopolymer chain model with that of a nongrafted but otherwise identical model .",
    "the model assumes an implicit solvent and an attractive substrate and in the case of the nongrafted chain a sterical wall some distance away from the attractive substrate confining the polymer .",
    "hence , also the nongrafted polymer is not completely free .",
    "nevertheless , we use the terms `` nongrafted '' and `` free '' synonymously in the following .",
    "our comparison spans a wide range of temperatures and surface attraction strengths .",
    "our study focuses on a simple `` bead - stick '' model of a linear polymer with fixed bond length and with three terms that contribute to the energy@xcite , @xmath0 where the first two terms are the energy of a polymer in bulk that consists of the standard 12 - 6 lennard - jones ( lj ) potential and a weak bending energy .",
    "the distance between the monomers @xmath1 and @xmath2 is @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denotes the bending angle between the @xmath1th , @xmath5th , and @xmath6th monomer .",
    "the third term is the attractive surface potential , where @xmath7 is the distance of the @xmath1th monomer to the substrate .",
    "it is obtained by integration over the continuous half - space @xmath8 , where every space element interacts with a single monomer by the 12 - 6 lj expression@xcite .",
    "the adsorption strength is controlled by the parameter @xmath9 which weighs the monomer - surface and monomer - monomer interaction .",
    "this model is chosen to facilitate comparison with previous work done by our group@xcite and adapted from the ab model@xcite , a standard model for hydrophobic - polar representations of peptides .",
    "in fact , the bending stiffness is a remnant of this modelling that has no qualitative influence on the results of this work .",
    "besides the temperature @xmath10 , we consider the adsorption strength @xmath9 as a control parameter and construct the phase diagram in the @xmath10-@xmath9 plane which reflects the structural behavior of classes of polymers .",
    "we consider the two cases , where ( a ) the polymer is grafted with one end to the substrate and ( b ) where it is allowed to move freely in the space between the substrate and a hard wall a distance @xmath11 away from the substrate .",
    "the chain length is chosen to be @xmath12 .",
    "the motivation of this comparison is strongly rooted in our findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , where we observed for a nongrafted 20-mer a strong , but trivial , dependence of the translational entropy of desorbed chains on @xmath13 .",
    "this led us to expect a qualitative difference between grafted and nongrafted adsorption that we subsequently analyze in the present work .",
    "as discussed in more detail below , it turns out that not only the translational but also the conformational entropy are responsible for the differences .",
    "although most of the transitions of such a polymer are related to thermodynamic phase transitions , for finite lengths they are typically just smoothly signaled in the fluctuations of canonical expectation values .",
    "additionally , those peaks differ in position for different observables , such that no well - defined transition point exists for finite systems .",
    "nevertheless , all transitions can be identified and found in a canonical as well as in a microcanonical analysis such that our method comprises both .",
    "dependent on the transition , one or the other ensemble provides a clearer signal of the phase transition .",
    "continuous transitions are sometimes hardly visible in the microcanonical entropy , but they are pronounced in canonical expectation values like the specific heat . additionally , the canonical ensemble seems to be more intuitive since most experiments are performed at constant temperature in a heat bath . on the other hand",
    ", the microcanonical approach provides a clear and easy method to differentiate first - order - like phase transitions from continuous ones and is in a way more fundamental , since it is based on the temperature - independent density of states @xmath14 .",
    "hence , a complementary analysis of both approaches provides a more detailed picture of the phase behavior .    in the canonical ensemble",
    "the system is assumed to be in equilibrium with a heat bath of temperature @xmath10 that it can exchange energy with .",
    "all possible states of energy @xmath15 are distributed according to the boltzmann probability @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 in the following ) , and to describe phase transitions , temperature fluctuations of canonical expectation values @xmath19 are investigated .",
    "all information encoded in those fluctuations is of course also present in the microcanonical quantities @xmath20 and @xmath14 .",
    "since fluctuations are integrated out , some information may be smeared out in the canonical analysis , and thus it is worthwhile to also look at these microcanonical quantities as it was , e.g. , already successfully done for peptide aggregation@xcite .",
    "the microcanonical entropy @xmath21 includes all entropic and energetic information .",
    "phase transitions can be identified via its slope @xmath22_{n , v}$ ] , the inverse microcanonical temperature , and its curvature @xmath23_{n , v}$ ]  @xcite . in the former",
    "they are typically signaled by inflection points that yield maxima in the latter@xcite .",
    "any conformational quantity @xmath20 , e.g. , tensor components of the radius of gyration , the distance of the center - of - mass of the polymer to the substrate , or the number of attached monomers , adds structural information to the picture .",
    "a word of caution is in order here concerning the term `` phase transition '' .",
    "phase transitions in the strict thermodynamic sense are only defined for infinite system size . only there",
    "the peak positions in the temperature derivatives of different canonical observables fall onto the same point , and the microcanonical and canonical ensembles are equivalent for sufficiently short - ranged interactions .",
    "hence , the `` phase transitions '' of the finite system described here are not phase transitions in the strict thermodynamic sense and are not uniquely located in the phase diagram .",
    "they indeed may even differ in nature from the corresponding infinite - system phase transition .",
    "the term `` phase transition in a finite system '' has to be read in the following with this in mind .        to study the model ( [ eq : energy ] ) , the parallel - tempering method@xcite together with an error - weighted histogram reweighting method similar to the one discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "64 - 72 different replicas covering uniformly a temperature range from @xmath24 to @xmath25 were chosen with 50000000 sweeps each , from which every 10th value was stored in a time series  the autocorrelation time is of the order of thousands of sweeps . for the canonical analysis",
    "this statistics is very generous ( about a fifth would have sufficed to gain a decent overview of the behavior ) , but to also reduce the fluctuations of the observables versus energy , in particular around the freezing transition , we increased the statistics . for low surface attraction strength ,",
    "64 replicas were enough to guarantee a sufficient overlap of the energy histograms . at",
    "higher @xmath9 , the low - temperature histograms have less overlap such that the addition of a very few extra replicas became necessary .",
    "all energy histograms @xmath26 from the parallel tempering run at inverse temperatures @xmath27 can be reweighted to yield an estimate of the density of states @xmath28 .",
    "these estimates are only of reasonable quality in an energy regime with sufficient statistics , i.e. , where the canonical energy distribution is peaked .",
    "since absolute estimates of the partition function can not be obtained in importance sampling monte carlo simulations , there is an unknown prefactor that is different for every @xmath29 . to get rid of it , we work with the ratio @xmath30 and",
    "since the density of states spans many orders of magnitude , it is advantageous to use the logarithm @xmath31 \\nonumber\\\\              & = & \\ln\\left[h_i(e+\\delta e)\\right]-\\ln\\left[h_i(e)\\right]+\\beta_i\\delta e.\\nonumber          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , a weighted average over all histograms @xmath32 can be taken with a weight approximately inversely proportional to the variance @xmath33 + this gives an excellent estimate of @xmath34 as long as all histograms overlap  which parallel tempering requires anyway .",
    "up to a constant , the microcanonical entropy @xmath35 is obtained by integration . conveniently , apart from being easily implemented and of similar performance as the more established multiple histogram reweighting or weighted histogram analysis methods ( wham)@xcite , this reweighting method directly estimates @xmath36 , which is the starting point of our microcanonical inflection point analysis@xcite .",
    "estimates of the statistical uncertainties are obtained by means of the jack - knife method@xcite , which yields robust and almost unbiased results even when applied to non - linear analyses of the raw data ( which , in our case , are the time series for each of the parallel - tempering replica ) .",
    "our statistics is so high that the error bars are hardly visible on the scale of the following figures . for better readability",
    "we have , therefore , included them only in a few representative cases .    in the following , we will collect and compare the findings for the different transitions .",
    "all transitions are contained in the phase diagram in figure [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "it is constructed by combining the information encoded in the canonical expectation values and their temperature derivatives for a number of observables . to give an example ,",
