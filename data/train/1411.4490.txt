    "hydrodynamics is considered now as an integral part of a future `` standard model '' for the evolution of the little bang fireballs created in relativistic heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ( for up - to - date reviews , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to complete the development of the `` standard model ''",
    ", a hydrodynamical approach must be supplied with initialization and breakup conditions : the former ones should describe transition from a dense non - equilibrated state to a near local equilibrium one , and the later ones form a prescription for particle production during the breakup of the continuous medium at the final stage of hydrodynamical expansion .    until now the main progress was reached in understanding and modeling the breakup conditions at the later dilute stage of matter expansion when the hydrodynamical approximation is no longer valid .",
    "namely , it is widely accepted that a quark - gluon fluid is followed by the hadronic gas that is highly dissipative and evolves away from equilibrium .",
    "the transition between the quark - gluon fluid and hadronic gas is described by means of the so - called hybrid models where conversion of the fluid to particles is typically realized at a hypersurface of hadronization or chemical freeze - out by a monte carlo event generator ( for recent discussions of the particlization procedure see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and subsequent hadronic stage of evolution is modeled by a hadronic cascade model like urqmd @xcite .    as for initialization of the hydrodynamical evolution , one needs to note that presently there is no commonly accepted model of the pre - equilibrium dynamics and subsequent thermalization ( for the discussions of possible mechanisms of thermalization see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . there is , however , theoretical evidence @xcite that the state which emerges in relativistic heavy ion collisions possesses large momentum - space anisotropies in the local rest frames .",
    "such an initial state is far from equilibrium and can not be utilized as an input for hydrodynamics . because initial state fluctuates on an event - by - event basis , monte",
    "carlo event generators are widely used for the generation of the initial states in relativistic @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the models of initial state most commonly used now are mc - glauber ( monte carlo glauber ) @xcite , mc - kln ( monte carlo kharzeev - levin - nardi ) @xcite , and ip - glasma ( impact - parameter - dependent glasma ) @xcite .",
    "the latter model also includes some non - equilibrium dynamics of the gluon fields which , however , does not lead to a proper equilibration . to apply these models for data description ,",
    "some thermalization process has to be assumed .",
    "evidently , in order to reduce uncertainties of results obtained by means of hydrodynamical models , one needs to evolve far - from - equilibrium initial state of matter in nucleus - nucleus collision to a close to locally equilibrated one by means of a reasonable pre - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "it is well known that for far - from - equilibrium systems one can not use the gibbs thermodynamic relations to get the equations expressing the conservation laws in the system in the closed form as is done in hydrodynamics .",
    "the latter is , in fact , an effective theory which describes long wavelength dynamics of systems that are close to ( local ) equilibrium ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) . as for far - from - equilibrium systems ,",
    "the underlying kinetics has to be used in direct form to enclose the energy - momentum balance equations .",
    "typically , even if underlying kinetic equations are known , the ( approximate ) solution of these equations is known only in the vicinity of the ( local ) equilibrium state of a system .",
    "for example , kinetic derivation of the viscous hydrodynamical equations for dilute gases is based on approximate solutions of the boltzmann equations near the local equilibrium distribution ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "sometimes , if proper kinetics is unknown or too complicated , the relaxation time approximation of the collision term is utilized ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the relativistic case ) .",
    "depending on a value of the time - scale relaxation parameter , a solution of such a kinetic equation interpolates between the two trivial limiting cases : free streaming and locally equilibrated evolutions .",
    "although the relaxation time approximation has been known for a long time , it is used relatively rarely for practical calculations of far - from - equilibrium dynamics because the corresponding kinetic equation has to be accompanied by the conservation law constraints for the collision term ( e.g. , landau matching conditions ) , which result in nonlinear equations .",
    "this is the reason why finding solutions of kinetic equations in the relaxation time approximation typically requires time - consuming numerical calculations ( especially for @xmath1 dimensional dynamics ) .",
    "recently , an approach called `` anisotropic hydrodynamics '' was developed to account for large early - time deviations from local equilibrium in relativistic heavy ion collisions in a hydrodynamic - like manner ( for review , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the zeroth and the first moments of the @xmath2 kinetic equation in the relaxation time approximation were used to find the evolutionary equations for the parameters of the boost - invariant romatschke - strickland form @xcite of the one - particle distribution function with the help of the landau matching conditions and exponential romatschke - strickland ansatz @xcite .",
    "then , utilization of the romatschke - strickland distribution function allows one to calculate the non - equilibrium energy - momentum tensor and express thermodynamic - like quantities ( which do not have standard thermodynamic interpretation ) as functions of some parameters in an equation - of - state manner , closing in such a way the system of the energy - momentum conservation equations .",
    "despite the fact that the romatschke - strickland distribution function does not satisfy the kinetic equation but some moments only , it was demonstrated that the energy - momentum tensor of anisotropic hydrodynamics approximates well the far - from - equilibrium energy - momentum tensor that is calculated from exact numerical solution of @xmath2 kinetic equation in the relaxation time approximation for a system which is transversely homogeneous and undergoing boost - invariant longitudinal expansion @xcite .",
    "very recently , various attempts were performed to generalize the anisotropic hydrodynamics framework to describe far - from - equilibrium dynamics beyond the @xmath2 dimensions , see , e.g. , ref . @xcite . unlike @xmath2 dimensional case ,",
    "such generalizations were not compared with exact kinetics , and their relevance for description of far - from - equilibrium dynamics remains questionable .",
    "in particular , to justify utilization of the generalized `` equations of state '' based on the romatschke - strickland ansatz beyond the @xmath2 dimensions , the concept of the `` anisotropic equilibrium '' has been introduced .",
    "the problem is that the far - from - equilibrium romatschke - strickland ansatz of the distribution function does not solve the corresponding kinetic equation , even approximately , and utilization of such an ansatz as `` leading order '' approximation does not have solid ground .",
    "it is different from the standard second - order ( israel - stewart ) viscous hydrodynamics , where expansion around local equilibrium distribution is justified in the vicinity of a high entropy local equilibrium state . as we noted above , this ansatz and the corresponding `` equations of state ''",
    "are grounded , in fact , on the boost - invariant transversely homogeneous kinetics , and therefore can hardly provide an adequate approximation of non - trivial transverse dynamics .",
    "it especially concerns calculations on an event - by - event basis , where a typical initial state is highly inhomogeneous in the transverse plane and produces locally large transverse velocities . on the other hand , utilization of transversely homogeneous initial conditions with very specific type of the initial anisotropy",
    "seriously restricts the scope of applicability of the anisotropic hydrodynamics .    in this article",
    "we use another phenomenological approach , proposed in ref .",
    "this approach allows pre - equilibrium dynamics to be matched to a hydrodynamic description .",
    "the method is based on the energy - momentum conservation equations that are associated with the relaxation transport dynamics , expressed for energy - momentum tensor that evolves towards its hydrodynamical form .",
    "it allows one , using the relaxation time parameter , to assess the hydrodynamic energy - momentum tensor at the assumed time of thermalization starting from any initial one .",
    "the key feature of the method is that there are no additional assumptions ( such as , e.g. , the landau matching conditions or `` anisotropic equilibrium '' concept ) needed to describe the transition from the far - from - equilibrium regime to the near local equilibrium one .",
    "then this model can continuously interpolate between a far - from - equilibrium initial state , with arbitrary type of anisotropy , and the regime described by the hydrodynamics .",
    "moreover , the method allows one to account for large initial state inhomogeneities that lead to non - trivial transverse dynamics .",
    "therefore the method may be used to model the very early stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions on an event - by - event basis .",
    "here we develop a numerical realization of this method , aiming to study the connection between initial locally isotropic or anisotropic momentum space distributions , and the equilibrium initial conditions for subsequent hydrodynamical evolution in relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "in this article we restrict ourselves to the central rapidity region , where the longitudinal boost invariance seems to be a good enough approximation to the longitudinal dynamics .",
    "it was proposed in ref .",

    "as we have discussed above , both the final energy density and transverse velocity profile in relaxation model do not coincide simultaneously with analogous values reached at fs- or hm- regimes , for any value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath102 . in the particular case of isotropic initial state ( @xmath129 ) , the energy - momentum tensor in the free streaming evolution acquires specific ( non - viscous ) non - equilibrium structure with the energy density higher than in the case of any continuous transition to hydrodynamics demonstrated at fig .",
    "[ fig : ex_anis_1_tau_rel ] .",
    "the reason is that one can not simply ignore the non - diagonal terms in the energy - momentum tensor that are developing at free streaming evolution @xcite , and diagonalize the tensor `` suddenly '' at , say , @xmath155 fm / c by using landau matching conditions , because then the energy - momentum conservation is violated .",
    "thereby , the continuous interpolation between arbitrarily anisotropic initial state and hydrodynamical regime at some later time , provided by the relaxation model , does not imply `` continuous interpolation '' between the two `` limiting '' types of the matter evolutions : free streaming and hydrodynamical .",
    "another important point , which we outline here , is the initialization of viscous hydrodynamics by means of the relaxation model .",
    "the relaxation model equations ( [ 8 ] ) include the israel - stewart viscous hydrodynamical formalism , and the corresponding viscous hydrodynamic code @xcite is modified to solve the relaxation model equations .",
    "we keep bulk pressure @xmath156 everywhere during the evolution , by default use zero initial values for the shear stress tensor , @xmath157 , and use anzatz for the relaxation time of the shear stress tensor : @xmath158 . in the viscous case one",
    "also needs to specify the temperature and entropy density from the equation of state .",
    "therefore for the viscous case we always use the eos for a relativistic massless gas of quarks and gluons , @xmath113 , which results in the following relation for energy density : @xmath159 where @xmath160 ang @xmath161 are quark and gluon degeneracy factors , respectively , and we set the effective number of quark degrees of freedom @xmath162 . equation ( [ 11 - 0 ] ) as well assumes that the chemical potentials are zero .",
    "the entropy density is then extracted using the thermodynamical relation @xmath163 . in the limiting navier - stokes case",
    "the fixed ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density @xmath164 is used .",
    "also , in this case we perform calculations with initially isotropic momentum space distribution , @xmath144 .",
    "the results of rm are compared with the results of hm with initial shear viscous tensor @xmath157 , and with results of hm with initial shear viscous tensor equals to its limiting navier - stokes ( ns ) form , @xmath165 .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ex_0.1 ] and [ fig : vx_0.1 ] , where the free streaming model calculations are added for comparison .",
    "the results of the relaxation model with zero viscous initial conditions are qualitatively similar to the results obtained in the relaxation model with the ideal fluid , for example , one can see from these figures that the relaxation model results in lower energy density in the center of the system and in higher transverse velocities as compared to the free streaming model . in the case of non - zero initial viscosity contribution at @xmath166 ( ns limit ) , the final energy density in such a model is larger than in the relaxation model .    finally we demonstrate that the viscous relaxation model , unlike `` anisotropic hydrodynamics '' , can be used not only for smooth initial energy density profiles , but also for bumpy anisotropic initial distributions at @xmath166 .",
    "the set of such bumpy individual samples is used in event - by - event hydrodynamic analysis . to avoid misunderstanding , note that our aim here is not analysis which of the models : mc - glauber , mc - kln or ip - glasma is more realistic for a data description ( for this aim one needs to utilize a large number of individual samples and describe hadron momentum spectra and their @xmath167-coefficients ) , but only the demonstration of capabilities of the relaxation model .",
    "thus , we pick randomly one particular ( fluctuating ) event corresponding to 20 - 30% central pb+pb collision at lhc energy generated with the glissando generator @xcite .",
    "the generator calculates the spatial distribution of sources , which fluctuates according to the statistical nature of the distributions of nucleons in the colliding nuclei , according to the monte - carlo glauber model .",
    "the transverse coordinates of the sources correspond to either the centers of the wounded nucleons or the centers of the binary collisions of nucleons in colliding nuclei .",
    "the corresponding relative deposited strength ( rds ) of each source is @xmath168 if the source comes from a wounded nucleon , or @xmath169 if it comes from a binary collision .",
    "we use the default value @xmath170 .",
    "one needs initial conditions , which are averaged within each cell , as a numerical input for the hydrodynamic or relaxation model . in order to get them",
    ", one can use one of standard outputs of glissando , which is a @xmath171 histogram filled with rds of all sources in the transverse plane .",
    "the default value of the bin size of the histogram is @xmath172 fm .",
    "formally it is similar to the coarse - graining procedure which is the basis of any macroscopic description ( say , hydrodynamic ) of a microscopic system .",
    "in fact , each hydrodynamic initial condition corresponds to many microscopic initial states with almost the same densities associated with the selected scale .",
    "so , if one wants to associate the single glissando event with further hydrodynamic evolution , the corresponding energy density distribution can not be very inhomogeneous .",
    "also , it is known that the viscosity parameters are related directly to the coarse - grained scale @xcite . at too small scales",
    ", the inhomogeneity of the medium can be so large ( tends to the point - like one in the limiting case ) that viscous hydrodynamics loses its applicability . to address this question we compare the results obtained for the ( non - smeared ) initial distribution described above with the results calculated for a smeared initial distribution .",
    "for the latter , we increase the bin size of the histogram from the default one , @xmath172 fm , to @xmath173 fm . to get the smeared initial distribution",
    ", we also distribute the energy from every individual cell to the transverse area centered around it , according to a gaussian profile with a radius @xmath174 fm . the non - smeared energy density profile , produced by glissando generator in the randomly selected single event , is demonstrated in fig . [ fig : id ] in comparison with the smeared one .",
    "note that both bumpy initial distributions , original and smeared ones , are normalized to the same mean value @xmath175 gev/@xmath176 of the energy density averaged in transverse plane within the central square with side @xmath177 fm .",
    "we use both , non - smeared and smeared profiles , instead of the gaussian one ( [ 9.1 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) . then , using the original and smeared @xmath178-profiles , the corresponding initial phase - space densities @xmath6 , as well as the initial energy - momentum tensors , can be defined on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the results of the relaxation model for the randomly selected single event with corresponding initial energy density distributions in fig . [ fig : id ] are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : ex_025 ] and [ fig : vx_025 ] for the case of relatively large viscosity parameter , @xmath179 , and @xmath152 .",
    "one can see the different level of inhomogeneity of initial conditions for hydrodynamics at @xmath1801 fm / c with smeared and non - smeared initial states at @xmath181 .",
    "simulations of @xmath0 collisions require initialization of the relaxation transport model for many such fluctuating initial states .",
    "the statistically relevant number of such events is of the order of event number @xmath182 that saturates the average value of initial conditions at @xmath20 .",
    "it is worth noting that for the glissando event generator @xmath183 .",
    "calculation in the relaxation transport model of a single event , that includes also evaluation of the source term @xmath184 in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) , takes about @xmath177 hours at one processor core .",
    "so , with parallel calculations ( @xmath96 processors ) the total time for event - by - event analysis of relativistic heavy ion collisions takes about one or two days .",
    "the dependence of the hadron spectra and @xmath167 on the coarse - graining scale as well as connection between the scale and viscous parameters is the separate important topic which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "a reliable analysis of the properties of quark - gluon plasma and initial state of matter formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions requires the knowledge of the pre - thermal dynamics of the collisions that leads to thermalization of the system and its further hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "however , until now there has been no fully satisfactory framework to address dynamical aspects of isotropization and thermalization in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "hence a consistent match of a non - equilibrium initial state of matter with hydrodynamic approximation in such collisions remains an open question .",
    "we have presented the results for hydrodynamical initial conditions obtained with the simulations of pre - equilibrium relaxation dynamics in the energy - momentum transport phenomenological model that was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . unlike the anisotropic hydrodynamics approach",
    "@xcite , where the artificial concept of `` anisotropic equilibrium '' based on @xmath2 dimensional kinetics for specific class of anisotropy is utilized instead of gibbs relations to close the system of evolutionary equations , this model does not have any additional assumptions and therefore can be applied for systems which are arbitrary anisotropic in momentum space as well as inhomogeneous in transverse plane .",
    "the latter is particularly important for the event - by - event hydrodynamical modeling of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we have calculated the initial conditions for the hydrodynamical evolution using initial states which can be initially isotropic or anisotropic in momentum space .",
    "the dependence of the target thermal state on the rates of conversion to hydrodynamical regime and different equations of state is presented as well .",
    "it allows us to study the influence of peculiarities of early initial state as well as pre - equilibrium dynamics on the energy densities and collective transverse velocities at the starting time of the hydrodynamical evolution .    in particular it is found that , with the same initial energy density , both final energy densities and pre - thermal transverse collective flows increase when the anisotropy parameter - the ratio of transverse pressure to longitudinal one , increases",
    ". therefore the highest hydrodynamical energy densities and transverse velocities at thermalization time are reached at initial zero longitudinal pressure that corresponds the cgc - like initial state .",
    "also , we found that for any relaxation time and initial momentum anisotropy , both the final energy density and transverse velocity profile in the relaxation model never coincide simultaneously with analogous values reached in the hydrodynamic model or at the free streaming regime .",
    "therefore , continuous relaxation dynamics from an initially non - equilibrium state to an ( almost ) equilibrium one can not be properly approximated by the free streaming or hydrodynamic regime .",
    "the commonly used prescription of sudden thermalization of the free streaming pre - thermal evolution results in discontinuity in the energy - momentum tensor , which for free streaming has specific ( non - viscous ) non - equilibrium structure .",
    "this results in a breakdown of the energy and momentum conservation laws .",
    "the peculiarities of the pre - thermal evolution also depend on the equation of state for the hydrodynamic component of the system .",
    "the two oppositely directed factors act simultaneously to the transverse gradient of the hydrodynamic pressure that contributes to formation of the transverse velocity field at relaxation evolution . on the one hand ,",
    "harder equation of state increases the gradient , but on the other hand , the hard equation of state could reduce it since more energy loss happens due to more work is done in longitudinal direction by the system contained in some rapidity interval . as a result , the maximal transverse velocities are reached for isotropic initial state in the following cases : for a soft equation of state ( eos ) at the free streaming evolution , for an ultra - hard eos at the pure hydrodynamic expansion , and for an intermediate eos for the relaxation evolution .    the developed relaxation model is also applied for the situations when the pre - thermal system relaxes to a close - to - equilibrium state described by viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "it is demonstrated that the viscous relaxation model can be utilized even with rather bumpy initial states , which allows one to use the model as a component of hydrodynamical event - by - event analysis .",
    "the physically clear explanations of the results allow one to conjecture that although the presented results are model - dependent , it is plausible to assume that they reproduce general properties of the pre - equilibrium dynamics for anisotropic initial momentum distributions .",
