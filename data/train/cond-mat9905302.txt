    "this exponential law is of practical interest since it gives a prescription for the measurement of the buoyant mass @xmath5 of the particles .",
    "however a recent experimental study of the sedimentation profiles of strongly de - ionized charged colloidal suspensions @xcite lead the authors to challenge the validity of this barometric law .",
    "an exponential behaviour was indeed observed in the asymptotic regime , but the measured gravitational length @xmath7 could differ significantly from the expected one ( a factor of two ) .",
    "@xmath7 was found to systematically overestimate the actual value @xmath8 , with the result that the buoyant mass measured within these experiments is systematically reduced compared to the known buoyant mass of the particles .",
    "some theoretical efforts have been made to study this problem .",
    "first biben and hansen  @xcite solved numerically the problem in a mean field approach , but unfortunately due to numerical difficulties the samples height considered where of the order of the micron while in the experiment the samples height are of the order of the centimeter . as a consequence , the dilute region at high altitude could not be studied in this approach .",
    "nevertheless the numerical results show a positive charge density at the bottom of the container and a negative charge at the top while the bulk of the container is neutral .",
    "this result show that a non - zero electric field exists in the bulk of the container and acts against gravity for the colloids .",
    "more recently one of the authors studied a two - dimensional solvable model for this problem  @xcite .",

    "while there is still a positive charge density at the bottom of the container , the negative charge density is not any more at the top of the container floating but at some altitude .",

    "no mass reduction is predicted by this model .",
    "however one should be cautious when comparing two - dimensional systems to the three dimensional case because the density in not relevant in two - dimensional coulomb systems : no matter how small the density is the system is always coupled , the ideal gas regime is never attained .",
    "for this reason a decay of the density similar to the one of an ideal gas is in itself surprising in two dimensions .    lately",

    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we want to study the case of high containers so we will consider very deionized systems in which the screening length is of the order of 0.1 mm , much larger than in usual physical cases , the other lengths taking `` physical '' values .",
    "that way the necessary number of points in the lattice will be reasonable ( a few hundreds ) . also , since the screening length is so large , the hard core of the macroions will not change the results drastically from the case of point particles so we will concentrate from now on on the poisson - boltzmann problem for point particles  ( eq .

    "boltzmann theory is not valid .",
    "the charge density profile confirms the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , that there is a strong accumulation of positive charges at the bottom of the container while there is a cloud of negative charge density floating at some altitude @xmath69 .",
    "there are clearly two neutral regions in the container : one at low altitude between the positive charge density at the bottom and the negative cloud , in which a non - vanishing electric field exists and a second neutral region at high altitude , over the negative cloud .",
    "the electric field in the lower region acts against gravity for the colloids therefore , as seen in the log plot of the colloids density profile , the decay is much slower than the one for an ideal neutral gas .",
    "numeric results for other series of samples suggest that this electric field is proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "in the upper region the colloidal density drops exponentially as @xmath71 since the electric potential is almost constant and the electric field vanishes .",
    "since the different densities vary with the altitude we can define a local screening length which depends on the altitude by @xmath72 the two regions of the sediment are caracterized by a very different behavior of this local screening length . in the lower region",
    "the colloidal density is so high that @xmath73 . in that region",
    "the colloids dominate the screening length . on the other hand in the upper region",
    "the colloidal density is very small and salt now controles the screening length which is then constant since at high altitudes the cations and anions densities are almost constant and equal to the mean salt concentration as seen in figure  [ fig : tous ] .",
    "it is interesting to notice that electric charges accumulate in the intermediate region around @xmath69 where there is a change of regime , in agreement with macroscopic electrostatics principles .",
    "the preceding remark allows us to understand how the physical parameters ( mean volume fraction of colloids , mass of the colloids , amount of added salt ) will modify the altitude @xmath69 which separates the two regions .",
    "for example if we add more salt , @xmath69 will diminish since we reach sooner the regime where @xmath74 .",
    "we have computed the density profiles in several other cases changing the values of the parameters in order to find the depency of @xmath69 in these parameters .",
    "our numerical results suggest that @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the preceding equation can be written in a more attracting way , introducing the screening length associated to the salt @xmath78 and the effective screening length associated to the colloids @xmath79 , as @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "we do not consider here boundary effects : this equation is only valid if @xmath69 is smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "the finite height @xmath18 of the container will have the effect to `` push '' the negative cloud downwards if the parameters are such that @xmath69 approaches the top of the container .",
    "the same holds for the bottom of the container if @xmath69 is too small .",
    "another quantity of interest is the size @xmath82 of the negative cloud , defined as the mid - height width of the negative peak in the charge density profile ( see figure  [ fig : tous ] ) .",
    "since we know that at @xmath69 altitude , @xmath83 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath84 , the screening length at that altitude is proportional to @xmath85 . from basic electrostatics",
    "we know that the system will only tolerate charges over a length of order of the screening length , we deduce that @xmath82 is proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "in fact the numerical results suggest also a linear dependency of @xmath82 in @xmath8 : @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and the same restrictions concerning boundary effects as for the equation for @xmath69 .",
    "as we mentioned before , at high altitudes ( larger than @xmath69 ) the electric potential is almost constant and the electric field vanishes . from this",
    "it is clear that the colloidal density will decay as @xmath71 and there is no apparent reduced mass .",
    "nevertheless let us notice that in the regime where the electric potential is almost constant in our calculations the corresponding colloidal volume fraction is smaller than @xmath89 .",
    "such volume fractions can not be measured experimentally . in practice the optical methods used in  @xcite allow to measure only volume fractions larger than @xmath90 .",
    "a possible explanation to the apparent mass observed in the experiments is that for volume fractions higher than @xmath90 the asymptotic regime where the electric field vanish have not been reached yet : there is a residual electric field responsible of the observed reduced mass .    in order to test this hypothesis we made a log plot of several colloidal volume fraction profiles restricting the plot to volume fractions higher than @xmath90 ( figure  [ fig : pentes ] ) .",
    "we computed the slope of the wing of the colloidal density to find an effective gravitational length @xmath7 which is higher than the actual gravitational length @xmath8 as observed in the experiments .",
    "futhermore when we plot the colloidal volume fraction profile and the corresponding electric field profile together ( figure  [ fig : logeta - et - e ] ) we notice that for volume fractions higher than @xmath90 the electric field is not zero .    the different plots in figure  [ fig : pentes ] where obtained using different salt concentrations , so the sediment height ( which is proportional to @xmath69 ) varies .",
    "in this case we found that the apparent mass is a decreasing function of the height of the sediment , in agreement with the experiments .",
    "however the sediment height can be changed by changing other parameters like the mean colloidal density or their valency @xmath13 .",
    "computing the apparent gravitational length @xmath7 as defined before for other series of samples , we found that the apparent gravitational length @xmath7 does not depend on @xmath13 or the mean colloidal density . in our model",
    "the ratio @xmath91 is only a function of the salt density .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : lgstar - lambdasel ] ) shows the ratio @xmath91 as a function of salt screening length @xmath85 .",
    "as mentionned in the introduction the model presented above has motivated several studies both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to compare our numerical results with the most achieved version of the theory presented in reference @xcite .",
    "this theoretical approach is based on a constrained minimization of the free energy functional ( [ freeenergy ] ) assuming an exponential _ ansatz _ for the density profiles :    [ hartmut ] @xmath92    with this parametrization @xmath93 is the ratio of the reduced mass @xmath94 by the buoyant mass @xmath5 of a colloidal particle , @xmath95 denotes the fixed salt concentration , and @xmath96 is the fixed overall colloidal density per unit area , i.e. @xmath97 . the system considered in @xcite is semi - infinite , @xmath19 corresponds to the bottom of the sample and @xmath98 . @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the two variational dimensionless parameters of the theory , and the equilibrium density profiles @xmath1 and @xmath21 correspond to the values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 that minimize the free energy functional ( [ freeenergy ] ) .",
    "following reference @xcite , the minimization conditions express :    [ hartmut_min ] @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the coupling parameter ( @xmath60 is the bjerrum length introduced previously ) , and @xmath103 is the relative amount of added salt .",
    "function @xmath104 is defined by @xmath105 .",
    "although equations ( [ hartmut_min ] ) require a numerical treatment , it is possible to extract asymptotic expressions when the coupling parameter @xmath106 is vanishingly small ( strong gravitational coupling regime ) or large compared to unity ( strong coulomb coupling regime ) .",
    "such an analysis is presented in reference @xcite , and we only reproduce here the main features . when gravitational coupling is strong , @xmath107 , the reduced mass is given by @xmath108 ( forall values of the salinity @xmath109 ) and",
    "therefore no mass reduction is observed in this regime ( in agreement with the numerical results presented in reference @xcite ) . on the contrary , in strong coulomb coupling regimes , @xmath110 ,",
    "quite a large mass reduction is predicted , even in low salinity regimes @xmath111 ( in such a situation the mass reduction is given by @xmath112/(z+1 ) + o(1/\\gamma)$ ] ) .",
    "our numerical results based on a free minimization of the functional ( [ freeenergy ] ) show that it is indeed not the case , even though we observe nice exponential asymptotic behaviours at high altitudes . to emphasize this point we present in table [ table : res ] data obtained mostly in the strong coulomb coupling regime .",
    "excepted for the first value @xmath113 , which corresponds to the opposite strong gravitational coupling regime , the agreement between the theory presented in reference @xcite and the present free minimization is very poor .",
    "the effective mass predicted by the free minimization procedure corresponds to the actual mass within less than 0.1% in most situations , whereas the theory predicts effective masses that are only 2% of the actual mass !    to our opinion , the failure of the parametrization presented in reference @xcite is not due to the exponential _ ansatz _ itself , but to the constraint of global charge neutrality applied to the asymptotic regime .",
    "the theory presented in reference @xcite assumes that the profiles are exponential from the bottom of the sample to the top , as a result the free energy functional ( [ freeenergy ] ) has to be minimized with the constraint of global charge neutrality .",
    "however , the actual situation is quite different . if we refer to the experimental work done by piazza et al .",
    "@xcite , the exponential regime is reached only above a macroscopic layer of strongly interacting colloidal particles .",
    "data presented in the previous section ( see e.g. figure  [ fig : tous ] ) resulting from a free minimization of the functional also exhibit a dense macroscopic layer of colloidal particles in the bottom of the cell , and these profiles can not be simply represented by a single exponential .",
    "this feature can be incorporated to the model suggested by lwen , by splitting the cell into two parts .",
    "the upper part of the cell ( above a given altitude `` @xmath114 '' ) corresponds to the asymptotic region where the profiles can be accurately represented by an exponential , whereas below @xmath114 the profiles are more complicated .",
    "as we can see , @xmath114 is defined by the condition that the profiles are exponential above it .",
    "there is then no upper bound on the value of @xmath114 and the asymptotic profiles should not depend on its precise value . as a result @xmath114",
    "can be chosen arbitrarily large . as a consequence ,",
    "the part of the fluid located below @xmath114 can be considered as a reservoir fixing the chemical potential of the ionic species @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 is irrelevant since the local density @xmath20 is held fixed , and is thus not a variational parameter ) .",
    "although the full system must be charge neutral , the asymptotic part above @xmath114 has no reason to be neutral .",
    "we are then lead to minimize the free energy of the upper part of the cell in the grand - canonical ensemble . assuming that parametrization ( [ hartmut ] ) is valid above @xmath114 the minimization equation associated to the colloidal particles reads : @xmath118\\over\\partial a } =   \\mu_{\\mathrm{col}}{\\partial n_{\\mathrm{col}}\\over\\partial a}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 $ ] is now the free energy functional above @xmath114 : @xmath120&= & \\sum_{i\\in\\{\\mathrm{col},+,-\\}}\\int_{z_o}^{+\\infty } k_{\\mathrm{b}}t \\rho_i(z ) \\left[\\ln(\\lambda_i^3\\rho_i(z))-1\\right]\\,dz \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\int_{z_o}^{+\\infty } mgz\\rhocol(z)\\,dz + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{z_o}^{+\\infty } e\\rho(z)\\phi(z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath121 is the number of colloidal particles above @xmath114 per unit area . after some algebra , this minimization equation can be written on the form : @xmath122 = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 .",
    "we can easily check that when @xmath124 we recover the first equation of condition ( [ hartmut_min ] ) . as @xmath125 can be chosen arbitrarily large in our model",
    ", we easily see that this equation implies @xmath126 ( no mass reduction ) and : @xmath127 this new version of the theory is consistent with our numerical results predicting no mass reduction .",
    "a free minimization of the poisson  boltzmann theory used in references @xcite have been performed in this article which lead us to conclude that this simple mean field theory does not predict any mass reduction contrarily to previous approximate minimization of the same functional .",
    "these new results are fully consistent with the analytical results obtained in a two - dimensional case by tllez @xcite . in particular",
    ", we observe the same condenser effect between the bottom of the container and the top of the dense region , resulting from a competition between electroneutrality and entropy of the microions .",
    "data plotted in figure  [ fig : pentes ] give a possible explanation for the experimental results obtained by piazza et al . @xcite .",
    "although in the asymptotic regime we observe no mass reduction , this regime is attained for very low values of the colloidal packing fractions , below the experimental resolution ( @xmath90 ) in some situations . as a result",
