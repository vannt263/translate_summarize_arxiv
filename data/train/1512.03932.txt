    "spectral methods is one of the very widely used class of numerical solutions in computational mathematics .",
    "some examples can be seen in @xcite .",
    "while spatial derivatives are calculated using spectral techniques , time integration is performed using schemes such as adams - bashforth and runge - kutta etc @xcite .",
    "one of the very efficient methods is the split - step fourier method ( ssfm ) which was originally proposed in @xcite . in ssfm",
    "the time integration is performed by time stepping of the exponential function for an equation which includes a first order time derivative .",
    "ssfm is widely used in many branches of applied sciences including but not limited to optics , acoustics , oceanography .",
    "it is known that majority of the signals in nature and engineering devices are sparse .",
    "therefore the compressive sampling technique can be thought as a very efficient tool for measuring or simulating the such signals . in this paper",
    "it is shown that the efficiency of the compressive sampling technique can also be used for the improvement of the ssfm .",
    "for this purpose nonlinear schrdinger equation and its one- and two - soliton solutions are considered .",
    "the method proposed in this paper depends on the idea of using a smaller number of spectral components in ssfm . using a smaller number of spectral components and using the compressive sampling technique , it shown that the numerical integration can be performed with a significantly better efficiency compared to the classical ssfm .",
    "the proposed method is named as the compressive split - step fourier method ( cssfm ) .",
    "the sparsity property of the solitons in the time domain is used and @xmath1 minimization technique of the compressive sampling algorithm is utilized .    starting from the initial conditions time integration",
    "is performed with ssfm and cssfm .",
    "it is shown by using the cssfm , time integration can be performed with a significantly better efficiency compared to the ssfm with a high number of spectral components . also it is shown that the accuracy difference between two models is of negligible importance .",
    "therefore it is shown that the proposed cssfm can be a very efficient tool in computational mathematics .",
    "nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nse ) can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spatial and temporal variables , @xmath4 denotes the imaginary number and @xmath5 is complex amplitude .",

    "two soliton - solution can be written as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the parameters in these equations are defined as @xcite @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath4 in the last expression is the imaginary number .",
    "the constant parameters in these expressions are taken as @xmath15 as in @xcite .",
    "also the @xmath16 interval is chosen as l=[-20,20 ] for simulations following @xcite .",
    "ssfm is based on the idea of splitting the equation into two parts , the nonlinear and the linear part @xcite .",
    "the original form of ssfm can be seen in @xcite . since then",
    ", researchers have proposed many different versions of the ssfm .",
    "a literature view for the proposed modifications to ssfm can be seen in @xcite . for the nse ,",
    "the advance in time due to nonlinear part can be written as @xmath17 which can be exactly solved as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the time step .",
    "the linear part of the nse can be written as @xmath20 using the fourier series it is possible to write that @xcite @xmath21 \\right ] \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] therefore combining ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) , the complete form of the ssfm can be written as @xmath22 \\right ] \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] starting from the initial conditions this expression can be solved explicitly .",
    "this operation requires two ffts per time step .      since its first appearance in literature , compressive sampling ( cs )",
    "has drawn the attention of many researchers .",
    "today it is widely used in various branches of engineering , applied physics mathematics .",
    "some studies in digital systems such as the development of a single pixel video camera systems or analog - to - digital converter efficiently use the cs algorithm . in this section a brief summary of the cs",
    "is sketched .",
    "let @xmath5 be a @xmath23-sparse signal with @xmath24 elements , that is only @xmath23 out of @xmath24 elements of the signal are nonzero .",
    "using orthonormal basis functions with transformation matrix @xmath25 , @xmath5 can be represented in terms of basis functions .",
    "typical orthogonal transformation used in the literature are the fourier , wavelet or discrete cosine transforms just to mention few .",
    "therefore it is possible to write @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coefficient vector . discarding the zero coefficients of @xmath5",
    ", one can obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the signal with non - zero components only .",
    "cs algorithm states that a @xmath23-sparse signal @xmath5 of length @xmath24 can exactly be reconstructed from @xmath30 measurements with a very high probability , where @xmath31 is a positive constant and @xmath32 is the mutual coherence between the sensing basis @xmath33 and transform basis @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath34 random projections and using the sensing matrix @xmath33 one can obtain @xmath35 .",
    "therefore the problem can be re - formulated as @xmath36 where @xmath37 . so that among all signal which satisfies the given constraints , the @xmath1 solution of the cs problem is given as @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 minimization is only one of the alternatives which can be used for this optimization problem .",
    "the sparse solutions can also be recovered with the help of other optimization techniques such as re - weighted @xmath39 minimization or greedy pursuit algorithms @xcite .",
    "details of the cs can be seen in @xcite .      in a classical ssfm",
    "let @xmath24 be the number of the spectral components used for representation of a signal . by using @xmath34 spectral components with @xmath40 and using the cs technique to construct the @xmath24-component signal from @xmath34 components , it is possible to obtain a very efficient computational method especially for very long time evolutions .",
    "this method can be named as compressive split - step fourier ( cssfm ) method and recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "the selection of the number @xmath34 has to be done carefully depending on width of the @xmath23-sparse wave profile since @xmath34 need to satisfy the @xmath41 condition of the cs algorithm .",

    "after the time stepping , the @xmath24 point signal is reconstructed from @xmath34 components by using the @xmath0 minimization technique of the cs theory . it is shown that the method offered in here can reduce the computational effort significantly compared to the ssfm with @xmath24 components while the accuracy difference in the results is of negligible importance .",

    "is defined by ( [ eq02 ] ) .",
    "the two methods are in excellent agreement as it can be seen in the figure .",

    "additionally the computational effort required to run the various cases are summarized in the table  [ tabone ] below .",
    "the computation times given in the table are in the units of seconds .",
    "the times are measured on a dell vostro 1700 laptop with dual cores of 1.8 ghz and 1 gb ram , which is used to run the matlab code of 50 realizations . as it can be seen on the table , for smaller number of time",
    "steps the cssfm provides a small improvement in the computational effort .",
    "this is due to the computational effort required by the @xmath1 minimization .",
    "however for the bigger number of time steps , the computational effort is significantly reduced while the differences in the waveform are of negligible importance .",
