    "although the first transiting extrasolar planet ( tep ) was only discovered in late 1999 @xcite , and the second as recently as 2003 @xcite , the number currently known has already exceeded 1200 .",
    "the great majority of those are small objects observed using the nasa _ kepler _ satellite : validation of the planetary nature of these bodies has been greatly helped by their occurrence in systems of multiple planets ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but detailed studies are difficult due to their small size and long orbital periods ( @xmath0s ) .",
    "a significant number ( 231 as of 2015/07/21 ) of the known teps are hot jupiters , adopting a definition of mass @xmath1@xmath2  and @xmath3d .",
    "these are much better suited to characterisation with existing facilities , as their relatively large masses and radii , short orbital periods , and bright host stars make photometric and spectroscopic observations easier and more productive .",
    "perhaps the single most important observable property of a planet is its orbital period : the period distributions of exoplanets provide an insight into the mechanisms governing their formation and evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and a precise value is mandatory for performing follow - up observations .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table[tab : model ] contains our measurements of the physical properties of the wasp-57 system . compared to f13 , we find a less massive but larger star . as planetary properties are measured relative to those of their parent star , the planet is similarly affected .",
    "the measured planetary density is 3.5@xmath4 lower , at @xmath5@xmath6  compared to the value of @xmath7@xmath6  found by f13 .",
    "our results are based on a much more extensive set of photometric data so are to be preferred to previous measurements , even though the errorbars have not changed by much .",
    "a significant advance in our understanding of the wasp-57 system could be achieved by obtaining further spectroscopy of the host star , from which more precise values for @xmath8 , @xmath9 $ ]  and @xmath10 could be measured .",
    "this is of particular interest because of its metal - poor nature , whose effect on the incidence of different types of planets is currently under discussion @xcite .",
    "the age of the system is unconstrained in our analysis above , as often occurs when the host star is significantly less massive than 1@xmath11 .",
    "f13 inferred age estimates of @xmath122gyr for wasp-57a from its photospheric lithium abundance , and @xmath13@xmath14gyr from gyrochronological arguments and its rotation period derived from its radius and projected rotational velocity .",
    "the @xmath8  of the star is within the regime where starspots are common so we have checked if it is possible to precisely determine its rotation period from spot - induced modulation .",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram was calculated for each of the three seasons of superwasp data and can be seen in fig.[fig : psd ] .",
    "there are no strong peaks in the period interval of interest ( 530d ) , and no moderately strong peaks present at the same period in all three seasons .",
    "we conclude that the rotational modulation of the star is below the level of detection with the current data .",
    "f13 found that the measured mass and density of wasp-57b implied the presence of a heavy - element core of mass roughly 50m@xmath15 , via a comparison to the theoretical predictions of @xcite .",
    "this rather large core mass is surprising given the significantly sub - solar metal abundance of the host star ( @xmath16}}= -0.25 \\pm 0.10 $ ] ) . as we have found a significantly lower density for the planet ( smaller by 40% or 3.5@xmath4 ) it is germane to reconsider this conclusion .",
    "we have therefore compared our new mass and radius measurements with predictions based on three batches of theoretical models .",
    "* their table4 ) find planetary radii of 0.971.06@xmath17  for planets of mass 0.51.0@xmath2  and age 0.55gyr , again in accord with our results .",
    "these values are for a heavy - element fraction of @xmath18 , and larger fractions result in progressively smaller radii and thus poorer agreement with our radius measurement .",
    "finally , the properties of wasp-57b match the predictions of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig.6 ) for a 25m@xmath15 heavy - element core .",
    "the difference in radius between models with and without this core are only 0.05@xmath17  for a 1@xmath2  planet and 0.18@xmath17  for a 0.3@xmath2  planet , so are of a comparable size to the uncertainty in the radius of wasp-57b .",
    "our measured properties for this planet therefore do not provide significant support for a high metallicity or the presence of a heavy - element core .",
    "two of our datasets include observations in four passbands simultaneously ( @xmath19 for busca and @xmath20 for grond ) , whereas we have @xmath21- or @xmath22-band photometry from four different sources ( dfosc , eulercam , busca and grond ) , so it is relevant to search for possible changes in the measured radius of the planet as a function of wavelength .",
    "such analyses are the photometric equivalent of transmission spectroscopy @xcite and have been pioneered at optical wavelengths by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "changes in the radius measured from planetary transits , as a function of wavelength , are predicted to occur due to opacity variations which affect the height at which the atmosphere transmits light coming from the parent star in the direction of the observer . at blue wavelengths a greater atmospheric opacity due to rayleigh and mie scattering leads to a higher maximum depth at which starlight is transmitted , causing an increase in the measured radius of the planet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the grey lines through the empirical datapoints show theoretical predictions for a transmission spectrum of a gas - giant planet of solar chemical composition from madhusudhan ( priv .",
    "the darker - grey line includes features due to na and k whereas the lighter grey line also includes tio opacity . ]    the fundamental observable in this work is the transit depth , represented in our notation by the ratio of the radii @xmath25 or the fractional planetary radius @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter directly comparable to theoretical predictions is the true planetary radius , @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is correlated with other photometric parameters ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and its transformation into @xmath23 requires other parameters which have uncertainty but are common to all photometric passbands ( the error budgets calculated in the previous section show that these are @xmath27 , @xmath8  and @xmath9 $ ] ) .",
    "we removed these two effects in order to determine @xmath23 values with relative errorbars .",
    "we did this by refitting the light curves with all parameters fixed except @xmath25 , @xmath28 , the linear ld coefficient for the quadratic ld law , and the coefficients of the polynomials between differential magnitude and time .",
    "we then transformed the resulting @xmath26 values into @xmath23 using a fixed orbital semimajor axis , @xmath29 .",
    "this yielded a set of @xmath23 values and errorbars which are directly comparable to each other .",

    "we did not include the trappist light curves because the very wide passbands ( @xmath31+@xmath32 or blue - blocking filters ) yield minimal spectral resolution .",
    "although the grond data only partially cover a transit , which precluded their use in section[sec : lc ] , they give reliable results here because @xmath27 and @xmath33 were fixed during the fitting process .",

    "the fwhms of the passbands are shown for reference using horizontal lines .",
    "the originating @xmath26 values and passband characteristics are collected in table[tab : rb ] .",
    "two conclusions are immediately apparent from this figure .",
    "firstly , the planetary radius in the @xmath30-band is very small and very uncertain .",
    "secondly , the @xmath34 results are consistent with no variation of @xmath35 with wavelength .",
    "the @xmath30-band light curve shows a small transit depth and a high scatter ( see fig.[fig : rvary ] ) , which causes the anomalous @xmath26 measurement in this band .",
    "the discrepancy relative to the overall @xmath26 value obtained in section[sec : lc ] is highly significant at 4.8@xmath4 , and corresponds to approximately @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the pressure scale height , and in the case of wasp-57b is @xmath38 km ( @xmath39@xmath17 ) .",
    "a variation in @xmath23 of the size of @xmath36 is difficult to explain , and is not believable unless confirmed by additional data of much higher quality .",
    "the two @xmath32-band light curves also show a clear disagreement of size 3.2@xmath4 .",
    "fig.[fig : rvary ] also shows two theoretical transmission spectra calculated under different assumptions by madhusudhan ( priv .",
    "comm . ) using the atmosphere code of @xcite .",
    "these predictions are for a gas - giant planet of radius 1.25@xmath17  and surface gravity 25ms@xmath40  so have been scaled to match the smaller radius and lower gravity of wasp-57b .",
    "our finding of a small @xmath30-band @xmath26 is not consistent with these theoretical predictions .",
    "a close - up of the main part of fig.[fig : rvary ] is shown in fig.[fig : rvaryzoom ] .",
    "passband - averaged values for the transmission spectra are shown with black filled circles , and differ by up to @xmath41 .",
    "the rayleigh scattering slope could be significantly greater than this : @xcite found that rayleigh scattering caused the measured radius of hd189733b to be larger by @xmath42 at 400 nm than at 900 nm .",
    "the relative uncertainties in our measured radii for wasp-57b are below @xmath43 for two , and below @xmath41 for five , of the ten light curves ( see table[tab : rb ] ) .",
    "we are therefore sensitive to radius variations at the level of @xmath43 , which is smaller than both the difference between the two theoretical transmission spectra and the size of the rayleigh scattering slope detected for hd189733b .",
    "our data are therefore sensitive , in principle , to the atmospheric properties of wasp-57b . however , in practise , our measurements are insufficient for studying the atmosphere of this planet due to the anomalous result for the @xmath30-band and the scatter of the radius measurements in the @xmath33- and @xmath32-bands .",
    "the situation could be improved by obtaining data in narrower passbands ( i.e.  higher spectral resolution ) , and with repeated observations over the full optical wavelength range .",
    "particular attention should be paid to the @xmath30-band , which is an important discriminant between the two transmission spectra and also enhances sensitivity to the rayleigh scattering slope .",
    "wasp-57b is a relatively low - mass hot jupiter orbiting a cool star .",
    "amateur astronomers first noticed that its transits were occurring earlier than predicted , a finding subsequently confirmed by observations from professional facilities .",
    "we have presented ten transit light curves from amateur astronomers , plus 13 obtained using professional telescopes of which seven predate the discovery of inaccuracy in the orbital ephemeris of the system .",
    "we have determined a revised orbital ephemeris which differs by 24@xmath4 from the orbital period in the discovery paper , and can be used to predict transits to a precision of less than 1 minute until the year 2170 .",
    "we also obtained high - resolution lucky imaging observations , which show no evidence for nearby companions whose flux might have contaminated our light curves .",
    "we have used these and previously published data to redetermine the physical properties of the wasp-57 system , finding that both the planet and its host star are larger and less massive than previously thought .",
    "a comparison of our new results for wasp-57b to theoretical predictions for the properties of gaseous planets reveals a good agreement with models lacking a core or additional heat sources .",
    "this disagrees with the core mass of 50m@xmath15 postulated by f13 , but is in accord with expectations for a planet which formed around a star of significantly sub - solar metal abundance .",
    "we observed two of the transits of wasp-57 using two 2.2 m telescopes equipped with simultaneous multi - band imaging instruments : grond ( @xmath20 passbands ) and busca ( @xmath19 passbands ) .",
    "these data are well - suited to investigating the possible wavelength - dependence of the planet s measured radius due to effects such as rayleigh and mie scattering , and atomic and molecular absorption . whilst the radii in the @xmath44 and @xmath21/@xmath22 bands are in generally good agreement , the @xmath33-band measurement is slightly smaller than expected and the two @xmath32-band measurements are discrepant by 3@xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath30-band radius is crucial for measuring the rayleigh scattering slope , as well as separating the pm and pl classes proposed by @xcite .",
    "our measurement is 5@xmath4 below theoretical predictions , and the size of the discrepancy is inexplicable using current theoretical transmission spectra .",
    "this result is almost certainly spurious , and can plausibly be blamed on the strong absorption by earth s atmosphere at blue - optical wavelengths plus the faintness of the host star in this passband .",
    "successful detections of radius variations in optical transmission photometry have recently been announced for the teps gj3470b @xcite , qatar-2b @xcite and wasp-103b @xcite",
    ". only one of these studies presented data obtained shortward of the balmer jump , which is an important but observationally difficult wavelength interval ( see fig.[fig : rvaryzoom ] ) .",
    "transit light curves in the @xmath30 and @xmath45 bands have previously been presented for several teps , and have shown planetary radii either consistent with other optical passbands ( wasp-12 , @xcite ; tres-3 , @xcite ; wasp-17 , @xcite ; wasp-39 and wasp-43 , @xcite ; xo-2 , @xcite ) or somewhat larger than other optical passbands ( hat - p-5 , @xcite , j.  dittman 2012 , priv .  comm . ; gj3470 , @xcite ) .",
    "a universal feature of these studies is the reliance on either a single @xmath30-band transit light curve , which yields large uncertainties on the measured planetary radius , or the use of data not obtained simultaneously in multiple passbands , so the results are hostage to temporal changes such as induced by magnetic activity in the host stars .",
    "most transmission photometry studies also suffer from the use of wide passbands , which are insensitive to spectral features other than broad continuum slopes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "whilst suffering from a lower spectral resolution , transmission photometry has several advantages over transmission spectroscopy .",
    "these include being able to observe over a wide wavelength interval without being subject to second - order contamination , the ability to use comparison stars more distant from the planet host star , and the option to use telescope defocussing techniques to avoid systematic noise ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a counter - example ) .",
    "smaller telescopes can be used , making it easier in particular to observe multiple transits and thus demonstrate the repeatability of the experiment @xcite .",
    "we therefore advocate studies based on observations of multiple transits , obtained simultaneously through many intermediate or narrow passbands .",
    "these passbands should be well - defined by interference filters , thus avoiding compromises such as the variable red edge of the @xmath32 filter due to its reliance on the quantum efficiency curve of the ccd used ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the red leak in some @xmath30 and @xmath45 filters which is capable of causing spurious results for optically - blue objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with a sufficient number of passbands , it should be possible to achieve low - resolution spectroscopy of the atmospheres of extrasolar planets through the full optical wavelength range using the transmission - photometry approach .",
