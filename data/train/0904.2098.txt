    "diffractive processes are characterized by the presence of large rapidity regions not filled with particles ( `` rapidity gaps '' ) . traditionally discussed in terms of the `` pomeron '' , diffraction can be described as an exchange of a combination of quarks and gluons carrying the quantum numbers of the vacuum  @xcite .    at the fermilab tevatron collider ,",
    "proton - antiproton collisions have been used to study diffractive interactions in run  i ( 1992 - 1996 ) at an energy of @xmath5  tev and continue in run  ii ( 2003-present ) with new and upgraded detectors at @xmath6  tev .",
    "the goal of the cdf experimental program at the tevatron is to provide results help decipher the qcd nature of hadronic diffractive interactions , and to measure exclusive production rates which could be used to establish the benchmark for exclusive higgs production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the study of diffractive events has been performed by tagging events either with a rapidity gap or with a leading hadron .",
    "the experimental apparatus includes a set of forward detectors@xcite that extend the rapidity  @xcite coverage to the forward region .",
    "the miniplug ( mp ) calorimeters cover the region @xmath7 ; the beam shower counters ( bsc ) surround the beam - pipe at various locations and detect particles in the region @xmath8 ; the roman pot spectrometer ( rps ) tags the leading hadron scattered from the interaction point after losing a fractional momentum approximately in the range @xmath9 .",
    "the gluon and quark content of the interacting partons can be investigated by comparing single diffractive ( sd ) and non diffractive ( nd ) events .",
    "sd events are triggered on a leading anti - proton in the rps and at least one jet , while the nd trigger requires only a jet in the calorimeters .",
    "the ratio of sd to nd dijet production rates ( @xmath10 ) is proportional to the ratio of the corresponding structure functions ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 , and can be measured as a function of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath13@xcite . in the ratio ,",
    "jet energy corrections approximately cancel out , thus avoiding dependence on monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "diffractive dijet rates are suppressed by a factor of o(10 ) with respect to expectations based on the proton pdf obtained from diffractive deep inelastic scattering at the hera @xmath14 collider  @xcite .",
    "the sd / nd ratios ( i.e. gap fractions ) of dijets , w , b - quark , @xmath15 production are all approximately 1% , indicating that the suppression factor is the same for all processes and it is related to the gap formation .    in run  ii",
    ", the jet @xmath16 spectrum extends to @xmath17  gev , and results are consistent with those of run  i@xcite , hence confirming a breakdown of factorization .",
    "preliminary results indicate that the ratio does not strongly depend on @xmath18 in the range @xmath19  gev@xmath1 ( fig .",

    "the relative normalization uncertainty cancels out in the ratio , and the results indicate that the @xmath20 evolution , mostly sensitive to the gluon density , is similar for the proton and the pomeron .",

    "the shape of the @xmath21 distribution does not depend on the @xmath20 value , in the region @xmath23",
