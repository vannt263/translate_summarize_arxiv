    "during the last twenty - five years the lattice - boltzmann methods ( _ lbm _ ) have been greatly developed in many aspects .",
    "today they can be used , to treat multiple problems involving both compressible and incompressible flows on simple and complex geometrical settings .",
    "it is of crucial importance , in many applications that involve moving bodies surrounded by a fluid flow , to have a good method or algorithm to compute the flow force and torque acting on the bodies . by good we mean a method that is simple to apply , that is accurate and fast , so as not to spoil the efficiency of the flow computing method .",
    "the classical way to compute forces , and so torque , on submerged bodies is via the computation and integration of the stress tensor on the surface of the body . in lbm",
    "the stress tensor is a local variable , its computation and extrapolation from the lattice to the surface is computationally expensive , which ruins the efficiency of the lbm .",
    "however , this method is widely used in lbm @xcite .    in 1994",
    "ladd introduced a new method , the _ momentum exchange _ ( _ me _ ) , to compute the flow force on a submerged body @xcite .",
    "ladd s idea was rather heuristic and very successful , where the force is obtained by accounting the exchange of momentum between the surface of the body and the fluid , the latter being represented by `` fluid particles '' whose momentum is easily written in terms of the lbm variables that describe the fluid at the mesoscopic scale .",
    "al . @xcite",
    "introduce some improvements to ladd proposal , obtaining a robust method to analyze suspended solid particles , and excluding the simulation of the interior fluid with a modified midway bounce - back boundary condition .",
    "then , using boundary condition method to arbitrary geometries , mei et .",
    "@xcite proposed a method to evaluate the fluid forces from the idea of me .",
    "the me algorithm is specifically designed and adapted to lbm ; it is therefore more efficient than stress integration from the computational point of view .",
    "the me algorithm has been tested and applied successfully to a variety of problems @xcite . for",
    "the mentioned me methods , except the presented in @xcite , some accuracy problems have been detected though , when applied to moving bodies @xcite .",
    "some approaches to improve the methods in problems with moving bodies were made .",
    "@xcite , based in the proposal of @xcite gives corrections terms to the forces given from @xcite .",
    "others alternative improved me methods , based in the evaluation of force respect to a moving frame of reference , were proposed in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide a formal derivation of the momentum exchange algorithm .",
    "this new derivation provides in turn , some corrections to the mei et .",
    "@xcite formula and also to some newer , improved versions of momentum exchange algorithm that have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_lbm ]",
    "we briefly discuss the lattice - boltzmann method with the main purpose of introducing notation ; the method used to treat boundary conditions is also explained in this section . in section [ sec : momentum_exchange ] , the core of the paper , we present a derivation of the momentum exchange method to determine both , the flow force and torque on static or moving bodies . in section [ sec : numerical_tests ] we present two numerical tests where we implement the methods derived in section [ sec : momentum_exchange ] . in section [ sec : comments ] we make some comments .",
    "in this section we present the basic equations of the lattice boltzmann methods with the main purpose of introducing the notation used along the paper . for a thorough description of the boltzmann equation",
    "we refer to @xcite . for a more complete presentation of lbm",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the boltzmann equation ( _ be _ ) governs the time evolution of the single - particle distribution function @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the position and velocity in phase space .",
    "the lattice boltzmann equation ( _ lbe _ ) is a discretized version of the boltzmann equation , where @xmath1 takes values on a uniform grid ( the lattice ) , and @xmath2 is not only discretized , but also restricted small number of values @xcite . by far",
    "the models used most frequently are the ones with collision integral simplified according to the bhatnagar , gross , and krook ( _ bgk _ ) approximation @xcite with relaxation time @xmath3 . in an isothermal situation and in the absence of external forces , like gravity , the lbe of this models read @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the @xmath6-th component of the discretized distribution function at the lattice site @xmath7 time @xmath8 and corresponding to the discrete velocity @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the @xmath6-th quadrature weight ( explained below ) , and @xmath11 the number of discrete velocities in the model . in compressible - flow models",
    "the lattice constant @xmath12 that separate two nearest neighbor nodes , and the time step @xmath13 are related with the speed of sound @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "and @xmath16 holds , but the constant @xmath17 is no longer related to the speed of sound . ] the coordinates of a lattice node are @xmath18 , where the integer multi index @xmath19 ( or , @xmath20 in the two - dimensional case ) denotes a particular site in the lattice .",
    "the equilibrium distribution function @xmath21 is a truncated taylor expansion of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "it is this approximation one of the reasons that makes lbm accurate only at low mach numbers @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic quantities such as the fluid mass density @xmath22 and velocity @xmath23 , are obtained , in boltzmann theory , as marginal distributions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 when integrating over @xmath2 . in lbm",
    "this integrals are approximated by proper quadratures .",
    "specific values of @xmath26 s and @xmath10 s , @xmath27 are made so that these quadratures give exact results for the @xmath2-moments of order 0 , 1 and 2 @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the simulations we present in this paper , we are interested in incompressible flow problems , where we modify eq .",
    "[ eq : lbmmacroscopics_1 ] according to the quasi - incompressible approximation presented in @xcite . in this approximation @xmath30",
    "is replaced by @xmath31 , a constant fluid mass density .",
    "a single time step of the discrete evolution equation is frequently written as a two - stage process @xmath32 and @xmath33 the computation of @xmath34 on the whole lattice , eq .",
    ", is called the _ collision step _ , while the computation of @xmath35 at @xmath36 , eq . , on the whole lattice is called _ streaming step . _",
    "many methods have been proposed in the literature to implement boundary conditions on moving boundaries with complex geometries in lbm .",
    "the method introduced in @xcite , later improved in @xcite , has been extensively tested and is the one we use in the simulations presented in this paper .",
    "we explain this method briefly in what follows .",
    "we emphasize that our derivation of momentum exchange is completely independent of the boundary condition method selected to perform the numerical tests .",
    "we consider a body that fills a region @xmath37 with closed boundary @xmath38 immersed in a fluid flow , and concentrate in a small portion of the boundary and its surrounding fluid as shown in figure [ fig_01 ] .",
    "the lattice nodes and links are also shown in the figure .",
    "empty circles represent nodes lying inside the body region ( solid nodes ) , while filled circles and squares represent nodes lying in the fluid region at the time shown .        at time",
    "@xmath39 a piece of boundary lie , in general , between lattice nodes .",
    "consider a node @xmath40 on the fluid with a neighbour node @xmath41 inside the body . to determine the values of @xmath42 ,",
    "the streaming step needs `` non - existent '' information coming from node @xmath41 .",
    "it is the lbm implementation of the boundary conditions what provides this information with the desired accuracy .",
    "the implementation of boundary conditions in lbm can be thought , at mesoscopic scale , as the introduction of a fluid flow inside @xmath43 it is this artifficial flow what provides the needed information to evolve the outer flow so that it satisfies the right macroscopic boundary conditions at @xmath44 even when the boundary @xmath38 is a physical boundary for the fluid , the mesoscopic lbm description of the fluid allow the fluid `` particles '' to stream across the surface @xmath38 , both from inside out and viceversa .",
    "we present here some particular proposals that will be used in section [ sec : numerical_tests ] . from now on we refer as `` boundary nodes '' those lattice nodes on the fluid side , like @xmath45 that are involved in the imposition of boundary conditions .",
    "the method presented in @xcite proposes to determine @xmath46 so that the linearly interpolated velocity at the boundary point @xmath47 is the correct boundary velocity at that point .",
    "this is @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the index for the opposite direction to @xmath50 ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 is a fictitious equilibrium distribution function at the fluid node @xmath53 @xmath54 are the weight factors of the lbm method .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are the boundary and fluid velocities respectively , with @xmath57 the intersection point between the boundary and the link joining @xmath41 with @xmath58 different choices of @xmath59 , a velocity between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , give alternative values of the parameter @xmath62 , the weighting factor that controls the interpolation ( or extrapolation ) . to improve numerical stability @xcite propose @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the fractional distance @xmath66    when the body moves with respect to the lattice",
    ", there may be nodes in the body region at time @xmath39 that become fluid nodes at time @xmath67 .",
    "it is then necessary to assign initial values to the variables at the new fluid nodes to evolve them . a practical way to do",
    "this is to evolve the nodes in the body region ( solid nodes ) so that they have values assigned when they become fluid nodes .",
    "there are more precise initializations for the variables at these nodes that change domain , like the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to have a robust and accurate method to compute flow forces in fluid mechanics .",
    "several algorithms have been proposed to carry out this in the context of lbm .",
    "many of these procedures fall in one of the categories : stress integration ( _ si _ ) or momentum exchange ( _ me _ ) .",
    "stress integration is based on the classical hydrodynamic approach ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in the context of lbm ,",
    "the computational performance of me is higher than that of si . in si",
    "one needs to compute the stress tensor in all lattice nodes which are near neighbors of the body surface .",
    "one then needs to extrapolate the stress tensor to the surface , and finally obtain the total flow forces on the body as an integral over the whole body surface . in me",
    "the procedure is simpler .",
    "the total force on the body is the sum of all contributions due to momentum change , in the directions pointing towards the body surface , over all boundary nodes .    in this section",
    "we write forces in general when we mean either force or torque .",
    "the idea of forces evaluation via momentum exchange was introduced by ladd @xcite as a heuristic algorithm by thinking the flow as composed by `` fluid particles '' and using particle dynamics to describe their interaction with the boundaries . in this method",
    ", a particle suspension model is proposed where the same boundary condition procedure is applied for both interior and exterior fluid , using in all cases a midway bounce - back boundary condition .",
    "the forces evaluations are carried out considering the interior and exterior fluid .    based in the works of ladd , aidun et .",
    "al . @xcite",
    "introduce some improvements to ladd proposal , obtaining a robust method to analyze suspended solid particles with any solid - to - fluid density ratio .",
    "they also proposed a modified midway bounce - back as boundary condition , and exclude the simulation of the interior fluid .",
    "the forces are evaluated considering the exterior fluid plus an impulsive contribution due to the nodes that are covered or uncovered when the body of interest move inside the fluid .    then , from the idea of momentum exchange , mei et .",
    "@xcite proposed a method to evaluate the fluid forces acting on a submerged body using a boundary condition method applied to arbitrary geometries .",
    "they exclude the simulation of the interior fluid as done in @xcite .",
    "the direct application of this method to problems with moving bodies fails to obtain accurate forces evaluation as was shown in @xcite .",
    "some proposals to improve the method presented in @xcite for problems with moving bodies were made .",
    "@xcite presented one of this proposals .",
    "their correction is based in the introduction of terms representing impulsive forces .",
    "al . @xcite",
    "give an improved an accurate method in moving geometry problems .",
    "the impulsive force terms introduced in @xcite and @xcite , come from the nodes that are covered or uncovered when the body moves with respect to the lattice .",
    "this correction provoked some controversies , the main discussion being about some `` noise '' that appear in the evaluation of forces .",
    "based on the work of mei et .",
    "@xcite , other approaches to evaluate forces in moving geometries , without the introduction of impulsive terms , were made .",
    "no rigorous proof was presented for these methods .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite present a similar methods that are based in computing the momentum exchange in a reference frame comoving with the wall .",
    "all the me based methods cited here were specifically designed for lbm and have been implemented and tested in many fluid - mechanical problems . to the knowledge of the authors there is no formal derivation of them in the literature .",
    "the work of caiazzo and junk present an analysis of me that uses an asymptotic expansion @xcite .    in this work",
    "we give a demonstration of me , from a fluid mechanics perspective , in which some terms previously introduced as ad - hoc corrections appear naturally .",
    "in particular , we find that the corrections proposed in @xcite and @xcite are adequate when evaluating the force in a reference frame fixed to the lattice . in the spirit of our deduction of me , we also deduce the alternative description presented in @xcite , which is based on a reference frame comoving with the body .",
    "we want to simulate a fluid flow around a submerged body , within a region of space that we denote by @xmath68 we consider @xmath69 to be a fixed region of space as seen on an inertial reference frame .",
    "we have covered @xmath69 with a uniform constant lattice to solve the fluid motion by applying the lattice - boltzmann method as described in section [ sec_lbm ] .",
    "the submerged body occupies a sub - region @xmath70 that we consider , along the whole simulation , strictly contained in @xmath69 .",
    "as the time dependence indicates , @xmath71 does nt need to be fixed .",
    "@xmath71 can move and could even change shape .    in this section",
    "we derive the force and torque that the flow applies on the body .",
    "the movement of the body is assumed to be prescribed along this derivation , i.e. , @xmath37 is a given function of @xmath39 . during an actual computation the body movement",
    "is determined by integrating the equations of motion of the body simultaneously with the flow equations .",
    "the equations of motion of the body take into account the fluid force on the body , the bulk forces like weight , etc .      for future reference",
    "we briefly remind here the reynolds transport theorem .",
    "we consider first the case of a fluid system .",
    "let @xmath72 denote a region that encloses a fluid system , that is a fixed material portion of the flow . in this case",
    "the velocity of the surface @xmath73 at any point is precisely the fluid velocity at that point .",
    "let @xmath74 denote a ( volume ) density describing some property of the fluid ( like mass density , momentum density , angular momentum density , etc . ) .",
    "the corresponding extensive property for the system is then @xmath75 the transport theorem states that @xmath76 here @xmath77 denotes the fluid velocity , and @xmath78 is the outward directed normal to the boundary @xmath79    now , let @xmath80 be a control volume ( a region of fluid defined for convenience that does not necesarily move with the flow ) with arbitrary movement , and let @xmath81 denote the velocity of a point at the surface @xmath82 in this case we have @xmath83    now , at a particular time of interest we choose a control volume @xmath84 which is concident with a system volume @xmath72 , but not in general at future times .",
    "that is @xmath85 , but @xmath86 if @xmath87 then we can eliminate the first term on the right hand side in by using which gives , @xmath88 notice that @xmath89 measures the fluid velocity at a boundary point with respect to that boundary point .",
    "we are interested in two particular cases .",
    "one of them is when @xmath90 is the total momentum contained in @xmath91 so that @xmath92 .",
    "the second case is when @xmath93 is the total angular momentum , with respect to a reference point @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 with @xmath96 the evaluation of equation or for the momentum and angular momentum cases give us the total force and torque applied over the fluid system contained in @xmath97 .",
    "the first term on the right hand side in represents the total variation of @xmath98 contained in the control volume @xmath84 , while the second term in the right hand side is a surface integral that amounts the @xmath98 flowing out of the volume @xmath84 .      as explained in section [ subsec : boundaryconditions ] , the boundary conditions can be thought as an artificial flow inside @xmath43 this artificial flow is in turn decomposed into @xmath11 artificial flows , one for each fundamental velocity @xmath9 in the method .",
    "to explain the effect of these flows we refer back to the figure [ fig_01 ] .",
    "consider the boundary node @xmath40 and the direction @xmath9 pointing from @xmath41 to @xmath40 . at every time step ,",
    "the rol of the boundary condition is to replace the value of @xmath99 that would otherwise be provided by a collision step , by a new value .",
    "altogether , these replacements carried out by the boundary condition are a way of introducing a certain amount of momentum in the @xmath6 direction , at every time step . we derive me by computing the amount of momentum that the boundary condition introduces per unit time . in this way",
    "we compute the force that each of these artifficial flows apply to the external flow .",
    "the addition over all elementary directions @xmath6 accounts for the total force the submerged body applies over the surrounding flow . by action - reaction principle , the force that the surrounding flow applies over",
    "the the submerged body is exactly the opposite .",
    "we consider the system of particles associated to a lattice velocity @xmath9 that at time @xmath39 is exactly inside @xmath71 . at @xmath67",
    "this system moves by an amount @xmath100 we call @xmath101 the set of nodes associated to this system of particles at time @xmath102 and @xmath103 denotes its momentum at time @xmath102 .",
    "finally we denote @xmath104 the set of lattice nodes @xmath41 inside @xmath105    in the following subsections we derive the force and torque that the flow applies to the body through its surface .",
    "the cases of static and moving bodies are treated .",
    "the amount of momentum the boundary conditions add per unit time to the @xmath6-th system of particles is @xmath106 where @xmath107 neglecting @xmath108 terms we have @xmath109      we assume first the case of a static body , so that @xmath37 and the set @xmath110 are constant in time .",
    "the first term in can be rewritten in terms of the sets @xmath111 of _ gained _ and @xmath112 of _ lost _ nodes as a consequence of the displacement of the system of particles from @xmath39 to @xmath67 .",
    "this displacement is exemplified in figure [ fig_02 ] for the @xmath113 model and the directions @xmath114 and @xmath115    to simplify notation we define @xmath116 .",
    "the first term in becomes @xmath117     and @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "the figure shows shaded areas proportional to the size of the sets @xmath111 _ gained _ and @xmath112 _ lost _ nodes when @xmath120 is displaced one lattice site in the @xmath121 ( left ) and @xmath122 ( right ) directions in the @xmath113 model . ]    inserting this into and adding over the @xmath11 systems we get the lbm approximation to the force introduced by the boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath123 we want to compare this expression with the reynolds transport theorem applied to the artificial flow inside @xmath71 .",
    "the force introduced by the boundary conditions is the constraint force acting on the body to keep it at a fixed position .",
    "the first term in the right hand side of is an lbm approximation of the volume term in .",
    "the second term in is composed of sums on sets of nodes which are near neighbours of the boundary @xmath124 .",
    "this second term is precisely the lbm approximation to the surface integral term in . as the interaction between the body and",
    "the surrounding fluid occurs only through the body s surface , this second term in is the term we are interested in . by action - reaction principle",
    "the flow force on the body is , @xmath125 notice that @xmath126 if and only if there is a node @xmath127 such that @xmath128 therefore @xmath129 now , a sum over all sets @xmath130 can be written as a sum over all sets @xmath111 , we obtain @xmath131 we notice that @xmath132 the first identity is the streaming step from the outer nodes in a direction that points into @xmath37 ( across the boundary ) .",
    "this values of @xmath133 are provided by the collision step .",
    "the second identity is a streaming step from inner nodes in a direction pointing outwards ( across the boundary ) ; these value of @xmath34 are provided by the boundary condition . the flow force on the sumberged body can then be written as @xmath134 to compare the equation with the equivalent ones in the literature , care has to be taken as regards different definitions of the sets @xmath135 equation is precisely the expression that appears extensively in the literature @xcite as the momentum exchange method to evaluate forces in static bodies .",
    "for the case of a moving body we show two alternative derivations of the flow force . in this way",
    "we recover the two main proposals that appeare in the literature .    when the submerged body is moving , the region @xmath71 and the set of lattice nodes @xmath136 are no longer constant . for some time steps",
    ", one can even expect the set of nodes @xmath137 to be the same as the set of nodes @xmath138 in any case it is useful define the sets of nodes @xmath139 and @xmath140 as @xmath141 figure [ fig_03 ] shows a scheme of a typical situation when the body moves .",
    "the expression is still valid in this case .",
    "however , at time @xmath67 we want to make reference to the body s new position , so we rewrite the term that sums over @xmath120 as     and @xmath142 .",
    "the figure shows shaded areas proportional to the size of the lattice nodes @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( left ) , and @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( right ) as defined in the text . ]",
    "@xmath145    we insert into and use the result into .",
    "then we add over @xmath6 to get an approximation of the flow force acting on the body @xmath37 @xmath146 where again , as we are looking for the surface contributions to the force , we dropped the volume contribution .",
    "equation shows a main term , which is the same as in the case of a static body , representing the particle s exchange of momentum across the boundary , but now this term is corrected by the last two terms which accounts for the momentum associated to the nodes that enter or leave @xmath71 as a consequence of the body movement . in this way we obtain terms similar to that proposed by aidun et .",
    "@xcite to evaluate the force on a moving body .",
    "we show that these terms are correct and necessary to obtain the complete superficial contribution to the force when the body moves .",
    "equation is then similar to that introduced in @xcite and by wen et .",
    "@xcite , extensively used in the literature to evaluate the fluid force on moving bodies .",
    "there is a minor difference between the expression and those introduced in @xcite and @xcite . in their cases ,",
    "the force at time @xmath39 considers the lattice nodes that enter and leave @xmath71 between @xmath147 and @xmath39 ( i.e. , backward in time ) . in our case , requires to know the sets @xmath148 and @xmath149 , that is the sets of nodes that enter and leave @xmath37 between @xmath39 and @xmath67 ( i.e. , forward in time ) .",
    "the determination of the sets @xmath148 and @xmath149 is direct if the movement of the body is given ( predetermined ) at all times , in this case is an explicit expression .",
    "if , however , the motion of the body is to be computed simultaneously with the flow , the equation becomes implicit . in this last case it is convenient to use an approximation to determine @xmath148 and @xmath149 so that the equation becomes explicit .    in the numerical tests in section [ sec : numerical_tests ] , we implement two different approximations to find the sets @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "both approximations work well , giving no appreciable difference in the outcomes of the benchmark tests .",
    "the first approximation is the procedure proposed in @xcite .",
    "the second approximation is more complicated .",
    "it computes the sets @xmath148 and @xmath149 by approximating the region @xmath150 as if it was moving with the speed computed at the previous time step . with this information",
    "the flow force can be computed at time @xmath39 and then the correct displacement of @xmath37 from @xmath39 to @xmath67 recomputed .",
    "though computationally more expenssive , as two displacements of @xmath37 are computed at each time step , this second approximation is more precise than the first one and may be worth using it in some situations .",
    "notice that the variables associated to the lattice nodes belonging to @xmath151 do not have values assigned at time @xmath39 since these nodes enter the fluid region between @xmath39 and @xmath67 .",
    "these values are needed in order to compute the time step from @xmath39 to @xmath67 .",
    "as mentioned previously , various rules to `` initialize '' these variables are proposed in the literature . in our simulations",
    "we implement the proposals given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also we implement a method that sets the mentioned variables by using the equilibrium distribution function , where the macroscopic variables are set as an average of the values at the nearest neighbor fluid nodes .",
    "the evaluation of the force by we present in section [ sec : numerical_tests ] show a short time scale noise .",
    "the use of the first two methods mentioned before to initialize the nodes that enter the fluid region present lower noise level .",
    "the main sources of `` noise '' in the force evaluation using are the impulsive nature of the additional terms related to @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "this noise have been observed before . in @xcite",
    "the authors show some alternative methods to avoid this undesirable effect . as the time derivative of the momentum",
    "@xmath152 is independent of the inertial reference frame , we can recover these methods by repeating the derivation we did before by choosing , for each lattice node @xmath18 and direction @xmath153 a convenient reference frame . for those nodes which are close to the boundary and for each direction @xmath6 pointing to the boundary",
    "we express the momentum in the reference frame in which the velocity @xmath154 of the intersection point of the boundary with the lattice link joining @xmath155 with @xmath18 is zero .",
    "the interior nodes that are far from the boundary contribute only to a volume term in the force , this volume term is dropped and therefore the reference frame is unimportant . the result obtained in this way is an lbm discretization of the surface term in the right hand side of @xmath156 the last two terms in the right hand side of are negligible since both @xmath157 and @xmath158 represent close approximations to @xmath159 at the boundary points .",
    "either expressions and are correct expressions ; they constitute different approximations of the flow force .",
    "the later has some advantages though .",
    "first , it is computationally more efficient , since it is not necessary to determine the sets @xmath139 and @xmath140 . as a result",
    "the method is always explicit and it presents a notorius noise decrease in force evaluation as shown in @xcite .      the derivation of the torque acting on the submerged body is analogous to that of the force .",
    "the angular momentum per unit time introduced by the @xmath6-th artificial flow is @xmath160 where @xmath161 with @xmath162 @xmath163 is the angular momentum of the particle system at time @xmath102 with respect to a fixed point @xmath164 neglecting @xmath108 terms in equation we have @xmath165    as we have done in section [ sssec : force ] , we treat the case of a static body first and then extend the proposal to the case of a moving body .",
    "using the lattice nodes sets @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( shown in figure [ fig_02 ] ) to rewrite the first term in , and denoting @xmath166 for simplicity , we have @xmath167 inserting this into and adding over the @xmath11 systems we get an approximation to the constraint torque acting on @xmath168 @xmath169 as in the force case , we can compare this expression with the reynolds transport theorem , then keeping just the approximation of the surface term in , we get an expression for the torque that the flow applies on the body , @xmath170 recalling the relation between @xmath171 and @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) , and using @xmath174 this equation is the expression that appears in the literature @xcite extensively as the momentum exchange method to evaluate torque on static bodies .      for a moving body",
    "we follow a procedure and reasoning analogous to that of section [ sssec : forces in moving body ] .",
    "we rewrite the first term on the right hand side of to get the correct surface contribution when the surface moves , @xmath175 we replace in , then from equation and adding over the @xmath11 systems we obtain an approximation of the constraint torque acting on the body at time @xmath176 thus the flow torque on a moving body turns out to be @xmath177 where we have used the relation of sets @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and the equalities .",
    "the equation has two distinct contribution to the flow torque on @xmath71 .",
    "the first one , is the contribution due to the exchange of momentum across the boundary as a consequence of the displacement of the particle system from @xmath39 to @xmath67 .",
    "the second one , is the contribution to the torque by the lattice nodes that enter and leave @xmath71 as a consequence of its displacement to @xmath150 .",
    "these are impulsive terms as we have noted in section [ sssec : forces in moving body ] .",
    "expression is similar to the one presented in the literature to evaluate the flow torque on moving bodies .",
    "this expression naturally introduces the ad - hoc correction terms first presented in @xcite and used in @xcite .    as with the force ,",
    "a difference between our proposal and those in the literature is the time at which the sets of lattice nodes @xmath178 and @xmath179 are evaluated . to avoid implicit expressions",
    "when the body movement is not predefined , we use some approximation methods , presented in section [ sssec : forces in moving body ] , to approach @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "as one could expect , some short time scale noise in the torque computation appears as a consequence of the lattice nodes that enter and leave the fluid domain as the body moves .    as with the force derivation",
    ", we also obtain an alternative derivation for the torque by considering the time derivatives of the angular momentum in different reference frames for each particle .",
    "the reference frames to compute the torque on the boundary nodes are chosen as in the derivation of .",
    "the expression we get for the flow torque on the body is @xmath180 as with the force , the last two terms are negligible .",
    "dropping these terms , the expression becomes explicit and present lower noise level in the torque evaluation .",
    "in this section we compare the results obtained with the expressions derived in section [ sec : momentum_exchange ] to compute the force and torque acting on a submerged body . to this end",
    "we perform two benchmark tests on well known problems that have been tested and benchmarked widely with others computational fluid dynamics methods , such as finite element method and finite difference methods .",
    "we are interested in analyzing the dynamics of single bodies sedimenting along a vertical channel filled with a newtonian fluid .",
    "the bodies are either circular or elliptic discs .",
    "the accuracy in the determination of the force and torque acting on the falling body directly affects the body s movement .",
    "if the force and torque are computed correctly , the displacement and rotation of the bodies along the domain should be in agreement with data presented in the literature @xcite .    to solve the flow we use a _",
    "d2q9 _ lattice scheme and srt with @xmath181 . the fluid density and the kinematic viscosity",
    "are set to @xmath182kg / m@xmath183 and @xmath184m@xmath185/s respectively .",
    "the fluid is initially at rest and has zero velocity at the horizontal and vertical boundaries at all times .",
    "we implement these boundary conditions with the method presented in @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of gravity acting on the body is @xmath186m / s@xmath185 downwards .",
    "the motion of each body is determined by integrating newton s equation of motion , where the force is given by the fluid flow force , weight and buoyancy force and the torque is given by the flow torque . to integrate in time we use euler forward numerical scheme , which is first order accurate as the lbm method itself .",
    "we have also implemented two step ( adams - bashforth ) integration in time and noticed no appreciable difference in the results .      in this benchmark test",
    "we analyze the dynamics of a single two - dimensional disc sedimenting along a vertical channel , shown schematically in figure [ fig_04 ] .",
    "we test the dynamics of the disc for two density relations @xmath187 , with @xmath188 and @xmath189 the densities of the body ( disc ) and the fluid respectively .",

    "the disc center is initially placed at @xmath193 with the coordinate origin at @xmath194 from the bottom of the channel and placed as shown in figure [ fig_04 ] .",
    "we discretized the computational domain with @xmath195 lattice points .",
    "we test the performance of the method for two density ratios @xmath196 and @xmath197 in figures [ fig_05 ] and [ fig_06 ] we show the horizontal and vertical velocities and the trajectory of the center of the disc and the rotation angle of the disc as functions of time , for @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "when the disc is released from the initial position at @xmath200 , it starts moving and rotating along the channel .",
    "as one can see in the figures [ fig_05 ] and [ fig_06 ] , the movement of the disc can be divided into two regimes : a transient and a stationary regime .",
    "we compare results we obtained using a classical me , and the corrected methods given by , and , .",
    "these results , particularly those obtained with the corrected methods are in good agreement with tests presented in @xcite ( obtained using lbm with si ) , @xcite ( obtained using lbm with an expression similar to , ) and @xcite ( obtained using fem ) .",
    "we observe visible discrepancies between the classical and the corrected methods for the horizontal velocity and position .",
