    "the search for a possible critical point of qcd is one of the driving motivations for the low energy runs at rhic / bnl and the upcoming facilities fair at gsi / darmstadt and nica in dubna .",
    "the assumed existence of a critical point is based on two observations : at vanishing baryochemical potential highly sophisticated lattice qcd calculations revealed an analytic crossover @xcite and at high baryochemical potentials various approaches to effective models in mean - field and beyond find a first order phase transition , which then necessarily terminates in a critical point @xcite .    at both ,",
    "the first order phase transition and the critical point , an enhancement of fluctuations is predicted to be seen in heavy - ion collisions . for the first order phase transition these are based on the growth of fluctuations due to the nonequilibrium effect of supercooling leading to nucleation and spinodal decomposition @xcite .",
    "such fluctuations should be visible in studies of single event particle distributions .",
    "the critical point , however , is supposed to imprint its signals in event - by - event fluctuations of conserved quantities , such as net - charge or net - baryon number distributions @xcite . in thermodynamic systems",
    "the correlation length diverges .",
    "systems created in a heavy - ion collision , however , are finite in size , highly dynamic and a temperature and baryochemical potential can at most be defined locally .",
    "the finite size of the system naturally limits the growth of the correlation length .",
    "the finite time , which the dynamic systems spends at a critical point , limits the growth even further because relaxation times also become infinite at the critical point .",
    "this phenomenon is called critical slowing down . assuming a phenomenological time evolution of the correlation length with parameters from the @xmath0d ising universality class it was found that the correlation length does not grow beyond @xmath1 fm @xcite . in all of these",
    "approaches the background medium is assumed to be homogeneous in its thermodynamic quantities , like the temperature .",
    "recently , the model of nonequilibrium chiral fluid dynamics ( n@xmath2fd ) for the explicit propagation of fluctuations coupled to a dynamic expansion of a heavy - ion collision was developed @xcite showing that nonequilibrium effects can have an important influence on the evolution of the fluctuations of the order parameter of chiral symmetry @xcite . in this model",
    "the expansion of the fireball created in a heavy - ion collision is described by ideal fluid dynamics , where the fluid consists of quark and antiquarks with the local thermodynamic properties of the quark - meson model @xcite .    in this work",
    "we want to investigate the influence of the inhomogeneity of the fluid dynamic background on the sigma field and the correlation length . for this purpose",
    "we restrict ourself to a local equilibrium treatment of the sigma field , instead of an explicit propagation but work with concepts that have already been studied in n@xmath2fd .",
    "we refer to these references @xcite for more information .",
    "for a fixed baryochemical potential @xmath3 the strength of the phase transition can be tuned via the quark - meson coupling @xmath4 . at @xmath5 and for a realistic coupling of @xmath6",
    "the transition is a crossover , for @xmath7 it is a critical point with @xmath8  mev and a first order phase transition with @xmath9  mev is found for @xmath10 .",
    "the thermodynamic potential of the quark - meson model in mean - field approximation is @xmath11 with the chiral potential @xmath12 and the quark contribution to fermionic one - loop level .",
    "the equilibrium values for the chiral fields , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are obtained from minimizing the thermodynamic potential ( [ eq : lsm_omegaq0 ] ) with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "while @xmath13 becomes finite at lower temperatures due to dynamic symmetry breaking , @xmath16 vanishes for all temperatures .",
    "we do not continue to explicitly mention the pion field in the notation .",
    "the minima of the thermodynamic potential @xmath17 define the thermodynamically stable states of the matter . in this case",
    "the pressure and the energy density of the system are @xmath18 the fermions are described fluid dynamically by the relativistic equation of energy - momentum conservation @xmath19 with the energy - momentum tensor of an ideal fluid .",
    "starting from initial conditions from urqmd @xcite the fluid has an inhomogeneous temperature distribution , which is determined by the evolution of the energy density .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium value of the sigma field is defined only locally in each cell of the fluid dynamic grid .",
    "speaking of the temperature of the system thus implies some form of averaging over parts of the system . as a consequence ,",
    "all quantities deduced from thermodynamic expressions are subject to the same averaging .",
    "a prominent feature in a scenario with a first order phase transition is the discontinuity of the sigma field at the transition temperature , which will be studied in section [ sec : sec1 ] . in a critical point scenario",
    "we investigate the correlation of the fluctuations based on the definition via the curvature of the thermodynamic potential in section [ sec : sec2 ] .",
    "in figure [ fig : fo ] we present the temperature and the sigma field averaged over an inner volume of about @xmath20  @xmath21 .",
    "as the system expands it dilutes and the energy density and the temperature become smaller until the coexistence region of the first order phase transition is reached .",
    "here , the local temperature stays constant .",
    "since almost all of the volume has an energy density in the coexistence region , also the averaged temperature stays almost constant .",
    "the averaged sigma field increases during the transition .",
    "if we assumed a homogeneous temperature of the system with the same evolution as the averaged temperature in figure [ fig : fo ] and assumed the corresponding equilibrium value of the sigma field for the entire system , we recover the discontinuity in the evolution of the sigma field .",
    "this discontinuity is washed out when averaging over an inhomogeneous system .",
    "in the right plot of figure [ fig : cp ] the same curves are plotted as in figure [ fig : fo ] but here for a scenario with a critical point .",
    "again we find that in the transition region the evolution of the sigma field is washed out in an inhomogeneous system after averaging compared to an assumed homogeneous temperature evolution . in the left plot",
    "we show the influence of the inhomogeneity on the correlation length , which is locally evaluated from @xmath22 we observe that due to averaging the correlation length in an inhomogeneous system does not diverge at the averaged critical temperature of the system .",
    "it remains finite and grows up to @xmath23  fm .",
    "when we assume again that the temperature evolution was a homogeneous temperature of the system we can calculate a single correlation length , which would correspond to the system s correlation length .",
    "it is shown in figure [ fig : cp ] for comparison .",
    "in finite systems one speaks about a critical region around the critical point , where the correlation length is still significantly enhanced but does not diverge . for an inhomogeneous system",
    "we find the same situation when averaging over parts of the system .",
    "we showed that the inhomogeneity of a system created in a heavy - ion collision smears out the evolution of the order parameter of chiral symmetry , the sigma field , in the transition region .",
    "the effect on the correlation length is more dramatic , as its divergence at the critical temperature in a homogeneous system is reduced to an increase up to @xmath23  fm . in the investigated scenario ,",
    "however , fluctuations of the sigma field are not directly studied .",
    "it needs to be said that the growth of the correlation length is a very dynamic process and should be studied in a fully dynamic setup , what is currently worked on within n@xmath2fd .",
    "2em this work was supported by the hessian excellence inititive loewe through the helmholtz international center for fair .",
    "we are grateful to the center for scientific computing ( csc ) at frankfurt for providing the computing resources ."
