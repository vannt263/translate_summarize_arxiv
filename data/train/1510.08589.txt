    "understanding the first source of light in the universe , the so - called primordial stars or population iii ( pop  iii ) stars , is crucial in determining how the universe evolved into what we observe today ( @xcite ) . with the help of state - of - the - art simulations along with the well established cosmological parameter @xcite ,",
    "recent studies have provided a standard model of the pop  iii star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this picture , the baryons ( mainly atomic hydrogen ) in low mass ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) dark matter halo with virial temperature @xmath7 k gravitationally collapsed at redshift @xmath8 20 via @xmath2 molecular cooling to form the very first stars in the universe ( @xcite ) .    initially the gas is cooled via @xmath2 rotational and vibrational line emission @xcite . however , the quick conversion of atomic hydrogen into molecules via the three - body reactions @xcite : @xmath9 @xmath10 can cool the gas rapidly at high densities ( @xmath11 @xmath1 ) .",
    "this results in the gas to be chemothermally unstable @xcite .",
    "the physical processes are extremely complex during the three - body reaction .",
    "the gas undergoes both heating and cooling simultaneously .",
    "heating is due to the release of 4.4 ev energy associated with every @xmath2 formation and gas contraction , and cooling is due to the emission , dissociation of @xmath2 and collisions of @xmath2 .",
    "however , there is little understanding of the interplay between the heating and cooling rates so far .",
    "in addition , the physics at high densities is relevant to the inception of the thermal instability ( first predicted by e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) that can generate fluctuations in the gas density in a comparatively shorter interval than the collapse time .",
    "the numerical simulations by @xcite found several chemothermally unstable regions .",
    "they have , however , pointed out that the instabilities do not lead to fragmentation as the turbulence efficiently mixes the gas , thereby erasing the fluctuations before they can grow significantly . in a different approach ,",
    "@xcite have calculated the stability of the gas cloud for isobaric perturbations by introducing the ` growth parameter ( @xmath12 ) ' , which must be significantly larger than unity for a clump of gas to break into multiple objects .",
    "a detailed analytical calculation of the instability criterion has been investigated by @xcite .",
    "the high resolution 3d @xmath13cdm cosmological simulation by @xcite has shown that the growth parameter indeed never becomes much larger than unity .",
    "it is infact less than 1.5 , which implies that the chemothermal instability can not lead to any fragmentation .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , more recently @xcite have used _ arepo _",
    "simulations to follow the evolution of the gas in minihaloes that fragments .",
    "they have suggested that this is due to the chemothermal instability because the ratio of the cooling timescale to the free - fall timescale drops below unity in the density space where the three - body reaction dominates .    our approach to study the chemothermal instability as the sole reason for fragmentation scenarios is significantly different from those in the previous works .",
    "for example , for the first time to the best of our knowledge , we investigate the heating and cooling balance in a full 3d simulation of pop  iii collapse to understand better the physical processes during the rapid conversion of atomic to molecular hydrogen . the closest study",
    "so far would be the analysis by @xcite .",
    "however , they examined idealised 1d collapse models without exploring the uncertainties in the three - body rates . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the chemothermal instability by comparing different heating and cooling rates and discuss their roles in the fragmentation during the long - term evolution of the disk .",
    "the simulation setup and initial conditions are similar to our previous study @xcite that used minihaloes from the cosmological simulations of @xcite .",
    "both the haloes start with a maximum central cloud number density @xmath14 10@xmath15 @xmath1 , the density before the onset of the three - body reaction .",
    "the details of the halo properties are given in table  1 .",
    "we use the halo configurations as the initial condition for our standard sph code gadget-2 @xcite that has been modified with the inclusion of sink particles @xcite and time - dependent chemical network for primordial gas @xcite .",
    "the snapshots from the hydrodynamic moving mesh code _ arepo _",
    "@xcite are converted into the gadget-2 implementation @xcite .",
    "this is possible because the mesh - generating points of _ arepo _ can be interpreted as the lagrangian fluid particles .",
    "the mass resolution in our gadget-2 simulation is @xmath16 10@xmath17 @xmath6 for 100 sph particles @xcite .",
    "once the gas density reaches @xmath18 @xmath1 , the cloud becomes opaque and the strongest of @xmath2 lines becomes optically thick .",
    "the @xmath2 cooling rate in this regime is calculated using the sobolev approximation ( as described in @xcite ) . at densities",
    "@xmath19 @xmath1 , the gas goes through a phase of cooling instability due to rapid increase in the cooling rate by @xmath2 collisional induced emission ( cie ) .",
    "we follow @xcite to use the rate in our cooling function . above the central density @xmath20 @xmath1 ,",
    "the gas becomes completely optically thick to the continuum radiation @xcite . at this point , the remaining @xmath2 dissociates by collisions with the atomic @xmath21 and other @xmath2 molecules , and consequently cools the gas resulting in further collapse .",
    "we ensure that our investigation is not biased on the chemical uncertainties and halo configuration .",
    "hence , we simulate the gas evolution in two different minihaloes with the extreme three - body rate coefficients : @xcite ( hereafter abn02 ) provide the slowest rate , @xcite ( hereafter fh07 ) provide the fastest rate . using the highly simplified one - zone models , the works by @xcite and @xcite examined minutely the effects of the uncertainty in the three - body @xmath2 formation rates and the cooling rate on the thermal evolution of the collapsing gas in simple bonnor - ebert spheres @xcite .",
    "they have found that the large uncertainty between the abn02 and fh07 , which differ by a large amount , lead to an uncertainty of approximately 50% in the temperature evolution of the gas in the density range @xmath22 @xmath1 .",
    "the primordial protostar can be modeled as a sink particle @xcite , which basically replaces the high - density region as a protostar that can accrete infalling mass . in our simulations ,",
    "the protostar is formed once the number density of the gas reaches 5 @xmath23 @xmath1 and temperature is @xmath24 1000 k. the jeans mass at this critical point is @xmath25 ( 1000k , @xmath26 @xmath1 ) @xmath24 0.06 @xmath6 and jeans radius is 6 au , which is the accretion radius , @xmath27 , of the sink particle .",
    "the spurious formation of new sink particles is avoided by preventing the sink particles from forming within @xmath28 of one another .",
    "depending on the halo configurations and chemical uncertainties , our simulations run @xmath29 yr after the formation of the first protostar .",

    "n - sph stands for the number of sph particles in the simulation . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "as the gas undergoes gravitational collapse , the crucial aspect to be investigated is whether the gas will be able to cool significantly or not .",
    "the rapid formation of hydrogen molecules via three - body reactions allows the gas to cool in less than a free - fall time , heralding chemothermal instability .",
    "this effect for both the abn02 and fh07 rates has been shown by @xcite , where we have found that the ratio of the cooling time to the free - fall time ( @xmath30 ) dips below unity at a certain density .",
    "this is exactly what @xcite have found in their simulations . in our present calculation , we have considered all the cooling mechanisms , including the contributions from chemical heating , to calculate the cooling time : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the energy per unit volume of the gas and @xmath33 is the net cooling rate in units of erg s@xmath34 @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the gas can cool as it collapses , and is hence undergoing chemothermal instability .",
    "it is to be noted that the drop in the ratio @xmath35 coincides with the onset ( in density space ) of the three - body @xmath2 formation @xcite .",
    "however , as we have discussed in section  [ sec : introduction ] , there is still some discrepancy of whether the fragmentation is stimulated by the chemothermal instability or not .",
    "fragmentation might also depend on other details , such as turbulence , rotation , etc ( see for examples , @xcite ) .",
    "the variation of the ratio of the cooling time to the free - fall time in the density space , where the three - body reactions take place , is too simple to make a definite conclusion about the fragmentation .",
    "a straightforward analysis involves comparing all possible heating and cooling processes that are responsible for setting the thermal balance in the gas .      in this section",
    ", we investigate the relevant cooling and heating mechanisms associated with the emission , chemical reaction and gas contraction during collapse .",
    "the synchronous effects of the cooling and heating rates make the chemical and thermodynamical evolution complicated    assuming the evolution of the gas density ( @xmath36 ) with the free - fall time ( @xmath37 ) , i.e. , @xmath38 , previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) show that the thermal evolution is followed by solving the energy equation : @xmath39 where @xmath13 and @xmath40 are the cooling and heating rate respectively in units of erg s@xmath34 @xmath1 .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : gas_props ] in which we compare the various heating and cooling rates in the simulation as a function of density .",
    "all the quantities are mass - weighted averages of the individual sph particles that are binned logarithmically in radius .",
    "these logarithmic - binned spherical shells are centered at the origin at @xmath41 .",
    "we have rigorously verified that the mass - weighted averaging does not throw away any physical information .",
    "the calculations are done once the central region has collapsed to a density @xmath24 5 @xmath23 @xmath1 , i.e. , just before the formation of the first sink .",
    "we take the total cooling rate as the sum of the @xmath2 line - cooling rate , collision induced emission cooling rate ( cie ) and dissociation rate ( i.e. @xmath42 ) and total heating rate as the combination of heating from the compression ( @xmath4 ) and the three - body formation of @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath43 .    figure  [ fig : gas_props]a shows that the total cooling can be as high as the heating associated with the three - body formation of @xmath2 , and thus the ratio of @xmath44 to @xmath13 is of order unity in the density space where the three - body reaction dominates .",
    "the three - body heating rates for the fh07 rise before the abn02 do because the higher @xmath2 formation rates of fh07 cause the gas to become fully molecular at lower densities . as a result",
    ", the gas in the fh07 case becomes optically thick at earlier times , preventing the thermal energy from being transported efficiently out of the disk .",
    "we have verified that other cooling processes , such as the heat loss due to the collisional dissociation or the collision induced emission are not effective until much higher densities .",
    "most importantly , when including the contribution from compressional heating , we notice that the total heating rate is always greater than the total cooling rate of the gas ( figure  [ fig : gas_props]b ) . for the gas to be chemothermally unstable to fragmentation",
    ", the heating and cooling rate must satisfy the condition : @xmath45 that could occur due to a sharp increase in the fractional abundances .",
    "however , in our case , the total heating rate dominates even in the high density regime .",
    "this leads to an ever increasing temperature with density .    from this analysis",
    ", we tentatively conclude that the gas can experience a dip in the ratio of the cooling time to the free - fall time in the density space , and hence becomes chemothermally unstable .",
    "however , the rapid cooling due to the three - body reaction is countervailed by the compressional heating .",
    "thus it never leads to significant drop in the temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    at this point",
    ", we would like to point out the differences with the work by @xcite . the use of the ratio @xmath30 as a criterion for fragmentation and collapse by @xcite neglects the heating due to the formation of @xmath2 and @xmath4 contraction .",
    "this heating generally exceeds @xmath2 cooling and dominates the temperature and density evolution of the collapsing gas , and hence its tendency to fragment and form new stars .",
    "another point to note is that a change in the analysis of the ratio , @xmath30 , does not necessarily coincide with a change in the ratio of the free - fall time to the sound crossing time @xmath3 which is a measure of the number of jeans masses .",
    "note that @xcite were the first to find the fragmentation in the pop  iii star forming haloes because they included the heating due to @xmath2 formation , whereas @xcite did not .",
    "these studies along with our detailed rigorous analysis support the claims that the contribution from both the three - body @xmath2 formation heating and compressional heating must be included to capture the fragmentation in the pop  iii star forming halos .      since the onset of the chemothermal instability",
    "is strongly associated with the formation of hydrogen molecules , it is therefore instructive to examine the rate at which @xmath2 actually forms in the collapse calculations .",
    "we calculate the @xmath2 formation rate @xmath46 from the data generated in our simulations and plot as a function of density in figure  [ fig : gas_props]c .",
    "to create these plots , we first calculate the number density of hydrogen molecules on a mass shell that has a particular density and temperature for a specific epoch ( i.e. , for a given snapshot at time @xmath47 ) . for the same snapshot ,",
    "we then keep on calculating the number density of hydrogen molecules for different mass shell ( each of which has a particular density and temperature ) .",
    "both the density and temperature are radially - logarithmic binned , mass - weighted averages .",
    "we repeat the procedure for the consecutive snapshot of time @xmath48 .",
    "we compare the @xmath2 abundances in these snapshots from the simulations over a time interval @xmath49 , with the rates given by @xmath50 note that an assumption here is made that the number density of the gas between the two snapshots does not change significantly and the time interval @xmath51 is chosen as small as possible ( @xmath16 8 months , considerably small compared to both the free - fall and cooling times ) .    over the range of densities in which the three - body reactions are important ( i.e. above @xmath52 @xmath1 ) , we find that the differences in @xmath53 between the simulations are strongly density dependent . around a density of @xmath54 @xmath1 ,",
    "the difference between the formation rates in the simulations is the highest .",
    "the curve is steeper in this regime , allowing us to infer that the rapid production of hydrogen molecules can cool the gas promptly and hence trigger the cooling time to be shorter than the free - fall time .",
    "note that at high densities this method is no longer strictly applicable as it is highly sensitive to the chosen time interval .",
    "however , this calculation provides a good estimate for the overall trend of the rate of @xmath2 formation inside the haloes in which we are particularly interested .",
    "fragmentation can be manifested in various terms , as it depends on the thermal and chemical history , interaction with the surroundings , gas mass and instability in the clouds .",
    "here we focus on how the thermo - dynamical evolution due to the heating and cooling rates can provide a hint of future fragmentation in our calculations .",
    "one can measure the instability in the gas by computing the number of jeans mass , or more appropriately the bonnor - ebert mass ( @xmath55 ) inside the central dense volume @xcite .",
    "this is same as comparing the fragmentation timescale ( @xmath56 ) with the accretion timescale ( @xmath57 ) . in other words ,",
    "the ratio , @xmath58 , is equivalent to the ratio , @xmath59 , i.e. , the inverse of the number of bonnor - ebert mass masses enclosed in the central volume .",
    "we define the fragmentation timescale as the rate of change in the number @xmath60 within a given radial shell @xcite , @xmath61 and compare it with the accretion timescale @xcite , defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are the mass accretion rate , enclosed mass and radial velocity , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : gas_props]d .",
    "the snapshots were taken just before the formation of the first protostar .",
    "the dashed lines represent the case when fragmentation timescale is equal to the accretion timescale .    if @xmath66 , the gas enclosed in the shells accreted faster than it can fragment . as a result",
    ", fewer new protostars are formed and the available mass contributes to the mass growth of the existing ones . in our case , we find @xmath67 , i.e. , the gas in the shells can fragment faster than it is accreted by the central dense clump , favouring low - mass protostars .",
    "therefore , comparing only the timescale , we get an indication of the possible fragmentation from the thermo - dynamical evolution of the gas before the onset of the sink formation .    at later epochs",
    ", we follow the simulations for @xmath29 yr ( depending on the cosmic variance of the minihaloes ) after the formation of the first sink particle .",
    "the column density in the inner 2000 au at the end of the simulations are shown in figure  [ disk_image ] . in all cases we see that the simulations exhibit the disk structure that fragments on several scales within this central region .",
    "we can also see that the density in the disk are slightly less in the case with the fh07 rate due to the increased @xmath2 fraction .",
    "the disk evolves with time with the matter accreted on to sink particles , and becomes more and more jeans unstable .",
    "we conclude that the temperature continues to rise with increasing density meaning that there is no preferred scale at which fragmentation takes place during the collapse .",
    "any future fragmentation is likely to be a result of the drop in the jeans mass that is a strong function of temperature .",
    "hence the intricate combination of the heating and cooling rates during the three - body reaction plays a significant role in determining the unstable clumps in the cloud .",
    "we have investigated the diverse cooling and heating mechanism in two cosmological minihaloes during the gas collapse to higher density .",
    "we have compared the physical processes with the extreme three - body formation rate coefficients proposed by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "we argue that although the quantity @xmath30 might determine the onset of the chemothermal instability , the increase in the @xmath2 cooling throughout the fully molecular gas is offset by @xmath2 formation heating with compressional heating .",
    "hence the thermal instability need not necessarily be the criterion for possible fragmentation . rather , the thermo - dynamical evolution that depends largely on the complicated combination of the heating and cooling rates develops the unstable clumps by affecting its jeans mass .",
    "this leads the disk to fragment on a scale of 1000 - 2000 au .",
    "however , the scale in which the fragmentation takes place depends on the three - body @xmath2 formation rates .",
    "for example , simulations employing the abn02 rate produce on average fewer and more massive fragments near the center , compared to those calculations using the fh07 rate @xcite .",
    "however , the scale of fragmentation is comparable to the halo@xmath68to@xmath68halo variation .",
    "our conclusion agrees well with the study by @xcite and @xcite that pointed that although the three - body reaction results in chemothermal instability , the growth of fluctuations are too small to lead to any fragmentation . despite considerable computational efforts involved , we emphasize here that we can not rule out the plausible concept of the chemothermal instability as the sole reason in all pop  iii disk fragmentation scenarios",
    "this is because of the fact that we have only considered two realizations .",
    "it is therefore of immediate interest to investigate the chemothermal instability in a number of minihaloes , like those in @xcite . in summary , we have explicitly shown various heating and cooling rates in a 3d simulation of pop  iii collapse .",
    "this unique approach to the problem enables us to conclude that the fragmentation behavior does not necessarily happen due to the chemothermal instability .",
    "instead , fragmentation occurs when @xmath2 cooling , the heat released by @xmath2 formation , and @xmath4 compressional heating together set the jeans mass in the gas to values that are conducive to breakup and collapse .",
