    "imagine a pair of spherical particles in a positive liquid crystal under weak anchoring conditions .",
    "when the center - to - center line is parallel to the optical axis the vdw attraction will be stronger than when it is perpendicular to the optical axis . since the electrostatic repulsion from double - layer overlap also depends on the dielectric constant , the balance between the attractive and repulsive forces will depend on the mutual orientation of the particles . as a result",
