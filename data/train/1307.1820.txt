    "model - independent searches for new charged vector currents , generally called @xmath3 bosons , that decay to top and bottom quarks @xcite are important tools for investigating physics beyond the standard model .",
    "following our recent theoretical calculation of a model independent analysis at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , the cms @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations set strong bounds on generic @xmath3 bosons as functions of effective coupling @xmath1 . while tighter mass bounds exist for special cases , such as pure left - handed @xmath4 bosons using lepton transverse momentum spectra @xcite , the top quark final state exhibits a resonant mass peak",
    "can be fully reconstructed @xcite . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate the first use of boosted - top jets for improving the reach in both @xmath3 mass and effective coupling @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we introduce a new boosted - bottom jet algorithm that provides the key to extending this analysis beyond existing measurements .",
    "@xmath3 bosons appear in many classes of theories that stabilize electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "high mass copies of @xmath5 boson resonances are proposed in some theories @xcite ; right - handed counterparts to the left - handed standard model @xmath5 are found in theories with a broken @xmath6 symmetry @xcite .",
    "other theories , such as non - commuting extended technicolor @xcite , promote a heavy mass eigenstate .",
    "@xmath0 bosons enter the lagrangian with terms of the form @xmath7 which mirrors that of the standard model @xmath5 ( without the lepton sector if it is right - handed ) . there could be left - right mixing , but such mixing is constrained by @xmath8@xmath9 mixing @xcite .",
    "theories have been proposed that would suppress this mixing via orbifold breaking of the left - right symmetry @xcite or supersymmetric interactions @xcite .    in searches for @xmath3 boson resonances between 13  tev , existing analyses @xcite",
    "are limited by their ability to reconstruct isolated decay products of the top quark ( @xmath10 ) . as the mass of the @xmath0 boson increases",
    ", relativistic angle compression causes the top quark decay products to merge into a `` fat jet , '' distinguishable from normal jets only by its substructure .",
    "several `` boosted top quark '' tagging algorithms have been developed @xcite to take advantage of these kinematics .",
    "so far these algorithms have shown promise in higgs plus top quark searches @xcite and @xmath11 events @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we examine the effectiveness of boosted - top tags in improving the reach to higher mass and smaller effective coupling .    in the first section of this letter",
    ", we describe our simulation of the @xmath3 signal and backgrounds in a dijet sample with a top tag .",
    "we find naive theoretical estimates of boosted - top tag efficiencies and mistag rates are too optimistic , and adopt the efficiencies measured by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "we also discuss a class of backgrounds to top tagging that have been previously ignored by experiments in hadronic channels , and place conservative upper limits on these backgrounds for the signal we consider .",
    "we introduce a new `` boosted bottom quark tag '' in the second section of this letter to improve the reach in mass and couplings . utilizing the kinematic features of tev @xmath2-jets along with the muon decay channel of @xmath12 hadrons",
    ", we find reasonable tagging efficiencies and good fake rejection .",
    "since our analysis is at the level of a fast detector simulation , we also recommend data samples where the efficiencies can be extracted .",
    "having described models for signals and backgrounds using the new boosted - top and bottom objects , we show that the reach in @xmath3 mass can be extended by 600  gev in the same amount of data as used in current limits . more importantly ,",
    "we find that limits on the effective coupling @xmath1 can be improved by a factor of 2 over the previous analysis techniques for masses above @xmath13  tev .",
    "hence , many perturbative models containing new charged - vector currents can be excluded up to @xmath14  tev .",
    "we conclude this letter with suggestions for future research .",
    "the process of interest is resonant @xmath3 production , with a decay into a boosted - top jet and a boosted - bottom jet ( @xmath15 ) at the lhc .",
    "the dominant backgrounds are expected to come from dijet production ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , where showering creates `` fat '' jets that fake boosted - top jets , and standard model ( sm ) production of single top quarks in the @xmath22- and @xmath23-channel ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and ditop ( @xmath26 ) , which pass boosted - top jet tags .",
    "in addition , we find a class of `` accidental '' backgrounds to boosted - top tags from @xmath27 and @xmath28 that we examine below .",
    "we simulate events by feeding the output of a general @xmath3 model @xcite and backgrounds produced in madevent @xcite into pythia @xcite for showering and hadronization .",
    "we reconstruct events using an atlas - like detector model in a modified version of the pgs 4 @xcite detector simulation we have previously calibrated to atlas data @xcite .",
    "cross sections are scaled to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) using ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath3 signal , and mcfm @xcite for backgrounds .    in order to make contact with experiment",
    ", we begin with a cambridge - aachen implementation of boosted - top tagging studied by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "the cms procedure is quite involved , but it roughly corresponds to finding a large ( @xmath29 ) hard jet whose mass loosely reconstructs to a top - quark mass between 100250  gev . in addition , the jet must decompose into three or four `` subjets , '' of which a pair must combine to produce a @xmath5-like mass ( @xmath30  gev ) .",
    "implementations of this top tagging algorithm are extremely sensitive to details of the detector simulation , such as non - uniform calorimeter segmentation . in implementing the cms algorithm",
    ", we initially found top - jet acceptances @xmath31 higher than observed by cms , and fake rates from light jets nearly an order - of - magnitude lower than observed by cms .    to reduce sensitivity to our detector model and provide a more realistic comparison between @xmath3 reconstruction using top jets and analyses where top decay products can be isolated @xcite",
    ", we fit transverse momentum ( @xmath32 ) dependent tagging efficiencies for top - jets and fakes rates provided by cms in figs .  13 and 14 , respectively , of ref . @xcite and apply them to our reconstructed jets .",
    "algorithm are quantitatively consistent with the fits we use here @xcite , suggesting low sensitivity to details of the algorithm . ]",
    "while the cms top - jet acceptance is asymptotically 45% at large @xmath32 , our results are driven primarily by the fake rate , which ranges from 14% over the @xmath32 range we reconstruct .",
    "this large fake rate would cause @xmath16 to completely dominate the signal if not for the new boosted - bottom tag introduced below .",
    "nothing in boosted - top jet algorithms requires the subjets to come from top quarks or showered light - quark jets ( fakes )",
    ". an important class of backgrounds to top tagging comes from @xmath33 or @xmath28 events , where one jet fluctuates close enough to a hadronically decaying @xmath5 or @xmath34 to pass the boosted - top algorithm .",
    "we model these contributions by using the detector simulation above to look for three jets in a cone of @xmath35 and applying a cut on the invariant mass of the three jets of @xmath36 gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_wjj ] we see a significant fraction of @xmath27 events pass the cut in @xmath37 , and we show below that this background is larger than either real standard model top or bottom quark processes after all cuts .",
    "similar backgrounds in semi - leptonic boosted - top decays have been examined by considering muon proximity to jets @xcite ; and a parameter @xmath38 has been proposed @xcite to suppress this non - top background .",
    "it is possible similar methods could be developed to suppress @xmath39 contributions to hadronic boosted - top decays .     between the @xmath5 and the nearest jet in @xmath27 events .",
    "events with @xmath40 are candidates for being tagged as a top jet , provided they fit a loose top - mass cut .",
    "[ fig : r_wjj ] ]    a significant challenge to estimating the backgrounds from @xmath27 or @xmath28 comes from instabilities of the perturbative calculation in the highly restricted phase space when a jet is near the @xmath5 . in order to place upper bounds on these contributions we estimate a theoretical error of 50% in the acceptance using two methods : first we look at increases in acceptance between leading order and nlo predicted by mcfm @xcite due to higher order hard radiation near the @xmath5 . in addition",
    ", we examine increases in acceptance between parton level and showering after pythia and reconstruction .",
    "both methods indicate at least 30% increases in boosted - top acceptance of @xmath27 , @xmath41 , and @xmath28 .",
    "hence , we include an additional @xmath8-factor of @xmath13 times the nlo cross section when calculating these backgrounds .",
    "fortunately , these backgrounds are suppressed by other cuts , but future boosted - top studies should account for them .",
    "in a @xmath42 final state , the jet containing the @xmath12 hadron which recoils against the top jet is typically the highest energy jet in the event .",
    "historically , the flavor content of the @xmath2-jet has been ignored @xcite because modern secondary vertex tagging is difficult above a few hundred gev .",
    "the decay products of @xmath12 hadrons with relativistic @xmath43@xmath44 are boosted to be approximately collinear , and hence tracking generally points back to the interaction vertex within the resolution of the detectors . in order to overcome the dijet backgrounds due to light - quark jets ,",
    "it is necessary to identify these @xmath2 jets .",
    "we propose a new `` boosted - bottom tagging '' algorithm that adds a kinematic twist to the old idea of @xmath2-tagging by observation of a muon inside of a jet . beginning with data at the fermilab tevatron , muon - tagging of @xmath2 jets",
    "was relegated to enhancing the efficiency of secondary vertex tags .",
    "typically , muons found within a 30 degree cone ( @xmath45 ) of the centroids of jets provide 1015% of the @xmath2-tagging efficiency @xcite .",
    "the fake rate for these muons is dominated by long - lived kaon and charged pion decays inside of the jets . as can be seen in fig.[fig : delrmuon ] , however , in jets with transverse energies of @xmath461500  gev almost all of the muons from bottom or charm decays are boosted to within @xmath47 , while muons from light - quark or gluon initiated jets have a broader spectrum in @xmath48 .",
    "this contrasts with usual @xmath2-tagging , where some fraction of muons is either soft or at wide angles to the @xmath2 direction .",
    "hence , our method for tagging boosted - bottom jets is to look for hits in a muon chamber within @xmath47 .",
    "separation between muons and the centroid of their associated jets in @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath16 events for jets with @xmath51 gev .",
    "muons from @xmath2 decays are more central than those from light quark jets.[fig : delrmuon ] ]    in addition to the smaller angle between the muon from @xmath2 decay and the jet , the transverse momentum of the muons from these boosted - bottom jets tends to be significantly harder that that of the light jets .",
    "we place a cut of @xmath52  gev on the muon in order to aid reconstruction .",
    "this value corresponds to roughly the minimum possible muon energy in the lab frame for these boosted kinematics .",
    "as luminosities increase at the lhc this threshold could be made proportional to the jet energy with a modest loss of acceptance .",
    "we extract transverse - energy @xmath53-dependent efficiencies for @xmath2 , @xmath54 , and light jet tags and list a few representative points in tab.[tab : btagrate ] .",
    "the ratio of @xmath2-tagging efficiency to fake rates is similar to what is currently achieved by secondary vertex tagging .",
    "the drop in efficiency below 400  gev is an artifact of using a fixed angular cut to maintain @xmath2 jet purity .",
    ".boosted - bottom jet efficiencies using a muon tag with @xmath55  gev and @xmath56 for @xmath2 jets , @xmath54 jets , and light jets @xmath57 as a function of jet @xmath53.[tab : btagrate ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figs .",
    "[ fig : couplingr ] and [ fig : couplingl ] we see that using a boosted - top tag improves the 95% c.l .",
    "exclusion limit on @xmath58 slightly for @xmath59  tev if @xmath60 .",
    "the region @xmath60 is difficult to measure as the width of the @xmath3 resonance grows rapidly with coupling ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we treat the full width effects using refs.@xcite since naive coupling scaling @xcite is only valid for @xmath62 .",
    "small differences between right- and left - handed @xmath3 are due to different @xmath24 branching fractions . in fig.[fig : couplingl ] we show both positive or negative interference between @xmath4 and the standard model . as expected , the interference is tiny in the resonance region .",
    "relative to @xmath63 as a function of right - handed @xmath64 mass .",
    "curves show the reach from current resolved - top quark analyses ( dashed ) , the boosted - top analysis ( dotted ) , and after adding a boosted - bottom tag ( solid ) .",
    "[ fig : couplingr ] ]     relative to @xmath63 as a function of left - handed @xmath4 mass .",
    "constructive ( lower lines ) and destructive ( higher lines ) interference with the standard model are nearly indistinguishable .",
    "[ fig : couplingl ] ]    in order to reach the full potential of this channel we next apply the new boosted - bottom tag .",
    "we see in tab .  [",
    "tab : tageffects ] the sample purity @xmath65 improves to @xmath66 , and the significance @xmath67 improves by 50% for @xmath68  tev .",
    "the boosted - bottom tag increases the reach in @xmath3 mass with @xmath69 by 600  gev .",
    "more importantly , the limit in @xmath58 improves by nearly a factor of 2 over existing approaches for masses above 1.5  tev , and remains perturbative to 3  tev .",
    "hence , models with slightly greater than standard model coupling , like orbifolded left - right breaking @xcite , can be ruled out for masses below 3  tev .",
    "combined with previous analyses below 1.5  tev , a wide range of perturbative models can be excluded for masses below 2.6  tev .",
    "in this letter we present the first use of boosted - top tags and introduce boosted - bottom tags in the search for new charged vector currents , called @xmath3 bosons , by looking at the @xmath24 dijet final state .",
    "we present a quantitative estimate of `` accidental '' backgrounds to boosted - top jet measurements which are comparable to or larger than all backgrounds other than direct dijet @xmath16 .",
    "we implement a detector simulated analysis whose efficiencies are fit to data , and find that boosted - top jets provide modest improvement on existing analyses of the @xmath24 final state which use isolated leptons and jets from top - quark decay .",
    "the key to improving the experimental reach in @xmath3 mass by 600 gev , and model - independent coupling @xmath1 by roughly a factor of 2 , is the use of a new `` boosted - bottom jet tag . ''",
    "this boosted - bottom tag should be useful beyond the signal presented here .",
    "in particular , studies of @xmath70 production to boosted - top can be supplemented by studies of @xmath71 .",
    "the smaller acceptance may be compensated by the greater background rejection from boosted - bottom tagging , and enhanced coupling to down - type quarks than to up - type quarks .",
    "any channel with bottom jets in the final state is now open to direct observation .",
