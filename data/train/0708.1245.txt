    "let @xmath5 be a sequence of positive real numbers and consider the analytic continued fraction @xmath6 this continued fraction defines a _ stieltjes function _ ; it can be represented in integral form as @xmath7 for some measure @xmath3 supported on the non - negative half - line such that the _ moments _ @xmath8 exist . by an obvious use of the geometric series , every stieltjes function can be expanded formally in powers of @xmath9 : @xmath10 hence @xmath4 is the _ moment generating function _ of the measure @xmath3 .",
    "it is a well - known fact of great practical importance that , given the first @xmath11 of the moments , one may construct the rational function @xmath12 where @xmath13 this truncation of the continued fraction ( [ continuedfraction ] ) has a maclaurin expansion whose @xmath11th partial sum agrees with that of the series ( [ series ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath14 is a diagonal ( if @xmath11 is odd ) , or near - diagonal ( if @xmath11 is even ) _ pad approximant _ of @xmath4 .",
    "now suppose that the @xmath1 are independent positive random variables with the same distribution , say @xmath15 .",
    "we shall consider the following questions :    1 .",
    "what are the almost - sure analytic properties of these stieltjes functions ? 2 .",
    "what is the almost - sure leading asymptotic behaviour of the error @xmath16 as @xmath17 ?",
    "these questions are of interest because pad approximation is widely used in applied mathematics as a practical means of accelerating the convergence of the partial sums of series obtained by perturbation methods . as pointed out by bender & orszag ( 1978 ) , the consideration of many particular cases where the @xmath1 are _ deterministic _ reveals a wide range of large-@xmath11 behaviours .",
    "our motivation for studying the random case is to gain some insight into the asymptotic behaviour of pad approximation in the `` generic '' case .",
    "our study of diagonal pad approximation reduces to aspects of the large-@xmath11 behaviour of the denominators @xmath18 . for this reason , as in the deterministic case , the cornerstone of the analysis is the three - term recurrence relation @xmath19 ( the @xmath20 satisfy the same recurrence relation , albeit with different initial conditions . ) this recurrence relation makes a link between pad approximation and a rich set of other mathematical entities , such as orthogonal polynomials , products of random matrices , and discrete schrdinger - like operators . by exploiting results that are well - known in these related fields ,",
    "one may obtain for a very large class of distributions @xmath15 of the coefficients @xmath1 some partial answers to the questions stated earlier .",
    "our contribution in the present paper is to elaborate the particular case where @xmath15 is the gamma distribution .",
    "more precisely , we obtain explicit formulae ( in terms of bessel functions ) for the leading term in the asymptotic behaviour of the error of pad approximation and for the asymptotic distribution of the poles , as well as the location of the essential spectrum of the measure @xmath3 .    in the remainder of this introductory section ,",
    "we describe briefly the key ideas underlying the analysis .",
    "then we summarise our main results in the form of a theorem .",
    "the stieltjes moment problem is , given a sequence @xmath21 , to determine whether or not there exists a measure @xmath3 such that equation ( [ moments ] ) holds for every @xmath11 .",
    "historically , mathematical objects such as the analytic continued fraction ( [ continuedfraction ] ) , orthogonal polynomials and pad approximants were introduced as tools in the study of this moment problem ( akhiezer 1961 ; nikishin & sorokin 1988 ; simon 1998 ) .",
    "stieltjes ( 1894 ) showed that a necessary and sufficient condition for the _ existence _ of a measure @xmath3 with the prescribed moments is @xmath22 he also showed that @xmath23 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the _ uniqueness _ of the measure .",
    "let us assume that condition ( [ stieltjesexistencecondition ] ) holds and describe in very broad terms one way of `` reconstructing '' @xmath3 from its moments ; see akhiezer ( 1961 ) and nikishin & sorokin ( 1988 ) for a detailed treatment .",
    "recall that @xmath24 is a _ point of increase _ of the measure @xmath3 if @xmath25 the _ spectrum _ of @xmath3 is the set of its points of increase and will be denoted @xmath26 . for @xmath27 , we shall denote by @xmath28 the probability measure on @xmath29 whose only point of increase is @xmath30 .",
    "given the @xmath31 , we may define an inner product , say @xmath32 , on the space of polynomials as follows : if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two polynomials with coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , then @xmath37 knowing the moments , we may compute the @xmath1 and the @xmath14 .",
    "we remark that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are polynomials of degree @xmath40 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "set @xmath41 then the fact that @xmath42 matches the moment generating series to @xmath43 implies that @xmath44 is orthogonal to every polynomial of degree less than @xmath11 , in the sense of the inner product @xmath32 .",
    "it follows ( see akhiezer 1961 , chapter 1 ) that the roots of @xmath44 are simple and lie in @xmath29 ; denote them by @xmath45 gaussian quadrature then defines a discrete measure @xmath46 that converges weakly to a measure @xmath3 that solves the moment problem . in particular , the inner product @xmath32 coincides with the inner product in @xmath47 .    the moment problem can also be approached from the point of view of operator theory .",
    "the recurrence relation ( [ threetermrecurrence ] ) for the @xmath18 implies the following recurrence relation for the @xmath44 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 these numbers may be used to define a certain jacobi operator , say @xmath50 , with a domain contained in the hilbert space @xmath51 , as follows : first , we consider sequences @xmath52 with only finitely many terms and set @xmath53 given condition ( [ stieltjesuniquenesscondition ] ) , it is then possible to extend this definition uniquely to obtain an essentially self - adjoint operator ; we use the same symbol @xmath50 to refer to this extension .",
    "it may then be proved that the moments of the spectral measure of the operator @xmath50 are precisely the @xmath31 , and so this spectral measure coincides with @xmath3 ; see nikishin & sorokin ( 1988 ) .",
    "consider the finite - dimensional truncation @xmath54 of the operator @xmath55 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath56 is the set of zeroes of the polynomial @xmath44 defined by equation ( [ psidefinition ] ) . by the chebyshev ",
    "markov  stieltjes theorem ( see nikishin & sorokin 1988 ,  2.8 ) , between any two zeroes of @xmath44 , there is a point of increase of @xmath3 ; so we are led to studying the distribution of the @xmath57 .    define a measure @xmath58 on @xmath29 by @xmath59 this measure is the normalised eigenvalue counting measure of the matrix @xmath56 . indeed , we have @xmath60    the normalised counting measure @xmath58 has a weak limit , say @xmath61 , as @xmath17 , and so there is a function @xmath62 , called the _ integrated density of states _ of @xmath55 , defined by @xmath63 if @xmath61 is absolutely continuous , one can also speak of the _ density of states _",
    ", say @xmath64 , defined by @xmath65 although the measures @xmath61 and @xmath3 may be very different , their essential spectra are the same . in the context of pad approximation",
    ", the integrated density of states describes the distribution of the poles of the approximants .",
    "there is an interpretation , due to krein , of the spectrum of the operator @xmath55 in terms of the characteristic frequencies of a vibrating string ( akhiezer 1961 ) .",
    "consider a weightless , infinite , perfectly elastic string , tied at one endpoint @xmath66 , along which some beads are distributed .",
    "let @xmath67 be the mass of the @xmath11th bead , and denote by @xmath68 its position in the @xmath69-plane .",
    "we assume that the @xmath70 are fixed and given by the recurrence relation @xmath71 for a string of uniform unit tension , the small vertical motion is then described by the discrete wave equation @xmath72 to study the characteristic frequencies of the string , we set @xmath73 then equation ( [ waveequation ] ) reduces to @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 . comparing this with the definitions of @xmath55 and @xmath44 given earlier , it is readily seen that @xmath77      dyson ( 1953 ) developed a method for studying the characteristic frequencies of the one - dimensional disordered chain @xmath78 here , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the ratios of the elastic modulus of the @xmath11th spring and of the mass of the two particles attached to it .",
    "disorder may be modelled in many ways ; for instance by assuming that the @xmath81 are independent and identically distributed .",
    "the approach was later simplified by schmidt ( 1957 ) and applied to the tight - binding anderson model for a one - dimensional crystal with impurities .    luck",
    "( 1992 ) gives a very readable , well - motivated account of the dyson ",
    "schmidt approach ; in brief , it builds on the intimate connection between second - order difference equations , continued fractions and markov chains . for our purpose",
    ", it will be convenient to work with the random difference equation @xmath82 where @xmath9 is a parameter in @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the branch of the square root function defined on @xmath83 that returns a number with a non - negative real part .",
    "we note the obvious    for every @xmath85 , @xmath86 where @xmath87 solves the difference equation ( [ differenceequation ] ) with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "[ denominatorlemma ]    the relevant continued fraction is @xmath90 and we write @xmath91 for its truncation . let @xmath92 and @xmath93 be complex random variables",
    ". then equation ( [ differenceequation ] ) defines a sequence of general term @xmath87 by recurrence .",
    "the distribution @xmath94 of the random variable @xmath95 is a stationary distribution for the markov chain @xmath96 ( in the terminology of iterated random maps , the random variables @xmath97 and @xmath98 are , respectively , the _ backward _ and _ forward iterates _",
    "associated with the continued fraction ; when @xmath88 and @xmath89 , they have the same distribution , but their asymptotic behaviours are very different ; see diaconis & freedman 1999 . )",
    "it follows that the growth of the @xmath87 may be quantified by means of the _ complex lyapunov exponent _ defined by @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the principal branch of the logarithm .",

    "we are able , for a very wide class of distributions @xmath15 , to deduce the almost - sure exponential nature of the convergence of diagonal pad approximation and also to deduce the almost - sure singularity of the measure @xmath3 .",
    "a more quantitative study requires the calculation of the complex lyapunov exponent , but there are very few known instances where it can be expressed in terms of familiar functions .    in his seminal paper on the disordered chain ( [ dysonchain ] ) , dyson studied in some detail the particular case where the @xmath81 are independent and gamma - distributed .",
    "dyson found the invariant distribution of the continued fraction @xmath124 in the particular case where @xmath125 ; he then used analytic continuation to obtain an expansion for the complex lyapunov exponent at @xmath126 , and hence for the distribution of the characteristic frequencies .",
    "dyson s continued fraction is not equivalent to ours ( compare equations ( [ dysonchain ] ) and ( [ waveequation ] ) ) , and so his analytical results do not transfer to our problem .",

    "related questions have been considered in the past , in different contexts .",
    "foster & pitcher ( 1974 ) study the convergence of random @xmath138-fractions ; these are continued fraction expansions which are in a one - to - one correspondence with the space of formal power series , but whose convergents are not pad approximants .",
    "foster & pitcher ( 1974 ) show that , under very general conditions on the distribution of the coefficients , the difference between two successive convergents tends to zero exponentially fast , and that the exponent is twice the lyapunov exponent associated with an infinite product of random matrices .",
    "geronimo ( 1993 ) studies the random measure ( on the unit circle ) generated by a three - term recurrence relation with random , identically distributed coefficients ; he shows the positivity of the corresponding lyapunov exponent and deduces that the random measure is singular with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "this list is not exhaustive ; see also csordas _ et al . _ ( 1973 ) and mannion ( 1993 ) .    the question of the nature of the measure @xmath3 has a counterpart in the theory of disordered systems which has been studied extensively in the context of anderson localisation .",
    "for example , the tight - binding anderson model uses a discretised version of the schrdinger equation with a potential that takes random , identically - distributed values at every point in a doubly - infinite lattice .",
    "the resulting operator has a second - order finite - difference form like that of the operator @xmath50in which , more precisely , @xmath139 and the @xmath140 are independent and identically distributed but it acts on sequences in @xmath141 . for a very wide choice of the distribution of the potential values @xmath140 , the lyapunov exponent of the discretised schrdinger operator is strictly positive , so that , by ishii s formula , the absolutely continuous spectrum is empty .",
    "a more refined study ( see for instance carmona & lacroix 1990 and pastur & figotin 1992 ) reveals that these operators have a _ pure point _ spectrum  that is , the spectrum is the closure of the discrete spectrum .",
    "such operators are said to exhibit the _ localisation property _ because , for this type of spectrum , the generalised eigenfunctions decay exponentially fast as @xmath142 .",
    "the rigorous extension of such detailed results to the semi - infinite case would involve technicalities which are outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "our analysis exploits a number of ideas and techniques found in these earlier studies .",
