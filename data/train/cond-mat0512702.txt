    "strongly correlated materials have been the subject of intensive researches for the last forty years .",
    "the simplest lattice model accounting for correlations is the one band hubbard model .",
    "great progresses have been achieved within the last ten years with the development of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) ( for a review see ref .  ) .",
    "one important result of the dmft is the description of the metal to insulator transition driven by correlations ( mott transition@xcite ) for the half - filled hubbard model . today , the mott metal insulator transition ( mit ) is the subject of intensive experimental and theoretical studies.@xcite recently , a renew of interest for the mott transition has occurred in relation with the so - called orbital selective mott transition@xcite observed in multi - orbital compounds .    in most of the experimental studies , strong electron correlations are closely connected with disorder effects .",
    "so , to change experimentally the band - filling , the band - width or other parameters , one replaces usually one atom of a given compound by another one . that is true for strongly correlated transition metal oxides or similar compounds .",
    "for example , replacing la by sr in la@xmath1sr@xmath2tio@xmath3 changes the doping , i.e.  the band - filling.@xcite in ca@xmath2sr@xmath1vo@xmath3,@xcite ca and sr atoms have the same valence but different atomic radii , which changes the angle of the v - o - v bond and , correspondingly , the band - width . more recently",
    ", a very interesting study@xcite on the metal - insulator transition in the disordered and correlated system srti@xmath2ru@xmath1o@xmath3 has been performed . from their transport and optical data ,",
    "the authors propose a classification scheme with six kinds of electronic states depending on @xmath4 .",
    "the disorder and the electron correlation effects should be considered together to understand the measured electronic structure evolutions .",
    "a generic model to study the common influence of disorder and correlations is the hubbard model including diagonal disorder .",
    "as we will outline below , it shows many features and metal insulator transitions not present in the standard hubbard model .",
    "a possible method to solve the disordered hubbard model is the combination of dmft with the coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite to treat disorder .",
    "it was used in the seminal work of laad _",
    "et al._,@xcite where the local impurity model of the dmft was solved by the iteration perturbation theory ( ipt ) .",
    "interesting results concerning the stability of the fermi liquid metal against small disorder and the effect of the interplay between correlations and disorder on the optical and raman response had been obtained .    for the disordered hubbard model , a first classification of the metal - insulator transitions at _ non - integer fillings _",
    "( and @xmath5 ) was given in ref .  .",
    "it used an analogy to the zaanen - sawatzky - allen scheme of charge - transfer or mott - hubbard insulators , respectively ( see also ref .   for the relationship to anderson localization ) . here , we will concentrate first on the hubbard model with diagonal alloy disorder at _",
    "integer filling_. with increasing hubbard correlation @xmath0 we find two metal - insulator transitions : first from a non - correlated band insulator to a metal and a second transition from a metal to a mott - hubbard insulator .",
    "the transition from a band insulator to a mott - hubbard insulator has been the subject of intensive current studies within the framework the half - filled ionic hubbard model ( ihm).@xcite the ihm corresponds to the spatially ordered limit of the binary alloy system which is considered in the present paper , @xmath6 , where the @xmath7 atoms are separated from each - other by an identical sequence of @xmath8 atoms . in particular , intensive analytical and numerical efforts have been performed to analyze the band insulator ( bi ) to mott insulator ( mi ) transition in the hubbard chain with alternating on - site energies.@xcite these studies show that the half - filled ionic hubbard chain has two transitions as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "the first is from the bi to a bond - ordered , spontaneously dimerized , ferroelectric insulator ( fi ) .",
    "the second , when @xmath0 is further increased , involves a transition between the fi and the mi . in this",
    "phase diagram the very unconventional metallic state is realized only at the bi - fi transition point .",
    "very recent studies of the generalized @xmath9 ih chain for @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the length of domain of @xmath8-atoms which separates @xmath7 atoms , show that at commensurate band - filling @xmath12 the system shows , with increasing @xmath0 , a similar sequence of transitions bi - fi - mi.@xcite therefore , in the case of 1d ordered binary chains , the bi phase is always separated from a mi by the _ insulating _ ferroelectric phase .",
    "although the mott transition in the disordered 1d binary chain has not been studied in detail , the anderson localization @xcite excludes the presence of a metallic phase in a finite sector of the ground state phase diagram of a 1d disordered ih model .",
    "therefore , the approach presented in this paper allows us to investigate in detail the band - insulator to correlated metal and metal to mott - hubbard insulator transitions in a disordered binary - alloy system for higher dimensions.@xcite below we analyze these metal - insulator transitions in detail . for that purpose",
    "we consider the spectral weight transfer with doping , and we find that it occurs in a selective way , different for the two disorder sites in question .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a finite temperature calculation of the dynamical properties by using the non - crossing approximation ( nca)@xcite to solve the dmft local anderson problem in the self - consistent loop .",
    "then we combine the dmft with cpa which is a very natural way since both methods use a local self - energy .",
    "spectral densities and spectral weight transfers will be computed with the nca .",
    "the role played by the temperature for the low energy physics will be discussed in details .    in the following section the model hamiltonian is presented .",
    "this section also presents the application of the dmft on this hamiltonian and a solving method based on the nca . in the third section ,",
    "the main results are discussed .",
    "these are the insulator - metal - insulator transition at _ integer filling _ and a detailed analysis of possible transitions at _ integer _ and _ non - integer _ fillings by using their spectral properties .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian , where correlations and diagonal disorder are present  : @xmath13 in expression  ( [ hamiltonien ] ) the sum @xmath14 is the sum over nearest neighbor sites of a bethe lattice . @xmath15 ( respectively @xmath16 ) denotes the creation ( respectively annihilation ) operator of an electron at the lattice site @xmath17 with spin @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the occupation number per spin .",
    "@xmath0 is the on - site coulomb repulsion and @xmath20 is the hopping term .",
    "a fraction @xmath21 of sites ( sites a ) have a local on - site energy @xmath22 and a fraction @xmath4 of sites ( sites b ) have a local on - site energy @xmath23 .",
    "we will note @xmath24 the energy difference between the two types of sites .",
    "following the dmft procedure of ref .  , by integrating out all fermionic degrees of freedom except for a central site @xmath25 , the lattice model  ( [ hamiltonien ] ) can be mapped onto an effective impurity model .",
    "the expression of the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath26 depends on the nature of the central site @xmath25 .",
    "it contains a local part @xmath27 and a part corresponding to the coupling to the effective medium .",
    "this coupling is determined self - consistently .",
    "we then write  : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is depending on the nature ( a or b ) of the central site @xmath25 . in the expression of @xmath27 , we have written explicitly the chemical potential @xmath30 .",
    "the coupling hamiltonian with the effective medium is @xmath31 @xmath32 represents the hybridization between the site @xmath25 and the effective medium .",
    "@xmath33 is the band energy of the effective medium .",
    "@xmath34 ( respectively @xmath35 ) is the creation ( respectively annihilation ) operator of an electron in the effective medium .",
    "the effective medium can be characterized by the effective dynamical hybridizations  : @xmath36 on a bethe lattice , the self - consistent equations of the dmft can be simply written @xmath37 where @xmath38 is obtained by averaging over disorder with the cpa procedure .",
    "we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( respectively @xmath41 ) is the green s function solution of the effective local impurity problem represented by the hamiltonian @xmath42 ( respectively @xmath43 ) .    to solve the local impurity problem @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 ) with the nca , we introduce four local states @xmath46 and their local energies @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 corresponds to an empty local site , @xmath49 ( respectively @xmath50 ) corresponds to a singly occupied local site with an electron of spin @xmath51 ( respectively @xmath52 ) , and @xmath53 corresponds to a doubly occupied local site .",

    "we finally obtain the site specific one particle green s function  : @xmath64\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and the partition function is @xmath66~.$ ]",
    "in this section , we present the calculated densities of states for the disordered hubbard model . in the first sub - section , we focus on the possible metal insulator transitions and in particular the nature of these transitions .    in the second sub - section  [ sswt ] ,",
    "we show how the site selective spectral weight transfer can help to understand the interplay of disorder and correlations for dynamical properties .",
    "one has to distinguish the metal insulator transitions at integer filling ( @xmath67 ) from those which occur at non - integer fillings ( @xmath68 or @xmath69),@xcite since at @xmath70 the mi transition with increasing on - site repulsion @xmath0 takes place only in the former case .",
    "let us first concentrate on those with @xmath67 . in that case , the concentration of sites a has to be @xmath71 .",
    "then , for each @xmath72 and sufficiently large values of @xmath0 we observe an insulating state for @xmath67 . before discussing the commensurate @xmath67 case",
    "it is very instructive to consider the case of a doping slightly below half - filling . in this case",
    "we have a strongly correlated metal with heavy quasi particles for all @xmath0 . that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dos_temp ] for @xmath73  ev , @xmath74  ev , and @xmath75 .",
    "nca applied to dmft is known@xcite to supply a fairly good solution even away from half - filling .",
    "for this strongly correlated situation , we found ( plain line ) a metallic state with four incoherent bands and one coherent resonance at the fermi level , witch is a signature of the presence of quasiparticles .",
    "the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle peak is shown in part ( b ) of the figure .",
    "although the density of states is almost constant at the fermi level , the low energy states near the fermi level are strongly temperature dependent . in part ( a ) of figure  [ dos_temp ] , we plot as well the spectral densities obtained from the solutions of the two impurity models with a site a or b embedded in the same effective medium .",
    "this gives enlightenment on the nature of the different bands forming the density of states for the disordered system and then allows to clarify the nature of the near insulating state . using the nca , it is possible to reduce arbitrarily the doping with increasing numerical efforts .",
    "band a1 ( respectively b1 ) is mainly composed of singly occupied a sites ( respectively b sites ) and spectral weights are proportional to the probability of removing one electron from a site a ( respectively b ) . correspondingly , the spectral weight of band a2 ( respectively b2 ) is proportional to the probability of adding one electron to a singly occupied site a ( respectively b ) .",
    "the energy gap between band a1 and band a2 ( or b1 and b2 ) is of the order of @xmath74  ev .",
    "we can identify a1 to a _ so called _ lower hubbard band ( lhb ) and b2 to a _ so called _ upper hubbard band ( uhb ) .",
    "we can therefore consider that the system is a strongly correlated metal , close to a mott insulator , with an insulating gap between the lhb ( a1 ) and the uhb ( b2 ) and a reduced effective value of the correlation strength @xmath76 .",
    "note the asymmetric role played by the two types of site . for @xmath75 , charge fluctuations",
    "are already blocked by correlations on sites b which are half - filled .",
    "the fermi level resonance peak is therefore only built up by electrons evolving on sites a. this result is confirmed by the respective local occupations @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "ev , @xmath73  ev and @xmath79  k. dotted line ( respectively dashed line ) shows the corresponding density of states for the impurity problem with a site a ( respectively b ) surrounded by the effective medium .",

    "as expected , starting from the strongly correlated situation @xmath83  ev , the system undergoes a transition to a metallic state for decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "there is a second critical value at which the system enters into a new insulating state with further decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "the nature of the insulator is completely different here .",
    "this can be clarified by examining part ( b ) of figure  [ dos_temp ] .",
    "sites b are almost filled ( @xmath84 ) whereas sites a are almost empty ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the two side bands of the gap correspond to singly occupied sites and can not be interpreted in terms of hubbard bands . therefore , this insulator can be understood as an ordinary band insulator .",
    "the metallic state for intermediate values of @xmath0 can be understood since in that case the energies for doubly occupied b sites @xmath86 and singly occupied a sites @xmath87 are nearly degenerate .",
    "for @xmath88 we have a special situation ( see fig .  [ dos_temp ] ) . in that case",
    "we have a single peak in the dos at the fermi energy , whereas in all other situations a double peak develops .",
    "we believe that the series of phase transitions insulator - metal - insulator is a rather generic situation and should occur in a wide class of models with two different species at equal concentration in dimensions higher then one .",
    "very recently a similar insulator - metal - insulator transition was obtained for the _ ordered _ hubbard model with two sites on a bipartite lattice.@xcite also , there is a quite large similarity to the transition between a mott - hubbard insulator and a band - insulator observed in the 1d ionic hubbard model , however due to the peculiarity of 1d systems the metallic state in this case is reduced to only one critical point corresponding to the transition from a bi to fi .    to characterize the different phases",

    "this is in contrast to the band - insulator case ( @xmath98  ev ) with the effective masses @xmath99 and @xmath100 proving the absence of heavy quasiparticles .    finally , let us discuss the metal - insulator transitions at non - integer fillings .",
    "they have been found by byczuk  _ et al._@xcite using the numerical renormalization group method at zero temperature , they have shown that the system becomes a mott insulator at strong interaction for @xmath68 or @xmath69 . here",

    "increasing the concentration of b sites leads to an increasing strength of the two hubbard peaks corresponding to b ( b1 and b2 ) . for @xmath105 , the lower hubbard peak of site b",
