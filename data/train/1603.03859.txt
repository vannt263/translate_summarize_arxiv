    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf primary and a roche - lobe filling low - mass companion in a tight orbit with a period of @xmath1  80min-10hr .",
    "some subsets of cvs with weak magnetic fields of the white dwarfs ( b@xmath010@xmath2 g ) , are classified as non - magnetic cvs including novalikes ( nl ) , dwarf novae ( dn ) , classic novae ( cn ) and recurrent novae ( rn ) . in these systems ,",
    "the material transferred from the secondary spreads into an accretion disk surrounding the primary due to the viscous processes between the adjacent accretion annulus ( e.g. friction and shear ) .",

    "the disk is typically the brightest component in a non - magnetic cv system and dominates most of the observed features , such as quasi - periodic dn outbursts of @xmath1  4 - 9mag and the nearly constant system light of the nl subtype . although there are some discussions about the relationship between the accretion disk and a nova outburst caused by a thermonuclear runaway ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the accretion disk in a dn system is a dominant light source in optical , uv and x - ray bands and plays a key role in dn normal outbursts and superoutbursts ( outbursts in short orbital period systems which are brighter and last longer than normal outbursts ) .",
    "comprehensive reviews of dn outbursts in disk systems are given in @xcite and @xcite .    during the four - year nasa kepler mission from 2009 march to 2013",

    "in particular , the short - cadence observations in the k2 mission extend the studies of sporadic variability and the changes in the disk and stream impact area ( i.e. , hot spot ) during normal outbursts and superoutbursts .    in this paper ,",
    "we report on the 15 cvs , of which 6 and 9 are in the k2 campaign 0 ( k2-c0 ) and campaign 1 ( k2-c1 ) fields , respectively .",

    "the rk catalogue ( version 7.21 released by @xcite ) , the downes web catalogue ( i.e. , cvcat ) , the crts database @xcite , the sdss database @xcite and simbad were used to search all known cvs which likely fall within the fields of view of k2-c0 and k2-c1 by using the code k2fov developed by the kepler team .",

    "the following c1 as the first full length observing campaign from may 30 to august 20 , 2014 , provided long cadence ( lc ; 30min ) observations for all objects as well as short cadence ( sc ; 1min ) observations for the three dn : qz vir , tw vir and rz leo .",

    "the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) provides target pixel files ( tpf ) stored under the sole ecliptic plane input catalogue ( epic ) identification number ( see table 1 ) .",
    "all 15 cv light curves were extracted from the original tpfs in c0 ( data release 2 ) and c1 ( data release 3 ) by using the program pyke , which was developed by the guest observer office @xcite .",
    "the four pipeline tasks of pyke : kepmask , kepextract , kepdraw and kepconvert were used to reduce the tpfs .",
    "the masks for the targets in a chosen frame with the brightest target were first defined manually , then the background was automatically subtracted from the tpf in the kepextract task .",
    "finally , the tasks of kepdraw and kepconvert were used to plot the extracted light curve and convert the data from fits to ascii .",
    "the original light curve plotted from the original ascii data file was separated into several small parts to remove cosmic rays by filtering with a simple median filter .",

    "the second is a period at 48hrs due to thruster firings to remove momentum .",
    "this periodicity is only seen clearly in the three original light curves in short cadence plotted from the direct output data files of the pyke , which show a nearly strict period of 3.9256day @xcite .",

    "galex measurements of fuv=18.42@xmath70.05 mags , nuv=17.90@xmath70.03 mags and the rosat x - ray count rate of 0.02cts / s are typical for cvs . several dn outbursts in march 2009 and january 2012 are reported in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the two discovery images obtained by a small telescope ( 13.5 cm ) in ka - dar observatory located at the mountain station of kazan state university show obvious position deviation from the other observations @xcite .",
    "both discrepant observations may be caused by their underestimated errors .",
    "all k2 measurements are of the brighter source in the dss finding chart .    considering that the sff corrected light curve has only a negligible improvement of 3.6% for this target , we only analyzed our reduced k2 light curve which is shown in the top panel of figure 1 . besides a long - term periodic variation clearly seen in the zoomed light curve ,",
    "there is a sharp decrease of system light occurring around bjd2456790 with an amplitude of @xmath1  0.25mag . after the normalization by removing the systematic variations from the original k2 light curve , a periodogram analysis clearly indicates two significant peaks at the period of 0.1621day ( 3.89hr ) and 0.3240day ( 7.78hr ) .",
    "the method of phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ; @xcite ) , confirms the result of the periodogram .",
    "the top plot in figure 4 shows that the period of 3.89hr has more power than that of 7.78hr .",
    "however , the phased light curve of the 35-day k2 data folded on the 7.78hr period , shown in the top panel of figure 5 , proves that this period is the correct one , showing two distinct peaks and dips during the orbit . a photometric period of @xmath1  0.32521day ( 7.81hr )",

    "the period of 3.89hr was also detected in the vsnet - alert report proposed by @xcite while other vsnet reports during the decline from outburst claim that it was variable @xcite .",
    "the 35-day k2 data clearly demonstrate the stability of the period of 7.78hr .",
    "it is very likely that this is the orbital period of the system and the longer period of 7.81hrs was a superhump period .",
    "several spectra were obtained over a timespan of one hour on 2015 february using the mods spectrograph @xcite on the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) .",
    "the spectra cover 3400 - 7400  using 2 gratings with a resolution of about 2000 .",
    "the summed spectra are shown in figure 6 while the red spectra at the beginning and end of the timespan are shown in figure 7 .",
    "these spectra show many absorption features yielding an approximate spectral type of k5v , which is consistent with a long orbital period system .",
    "the strong doubled nature of the balmer emission lines indicates a peak - to - peak separation of @xmath1  620km / s . during the hour timespan ,",
    "the doubled lines changed to a single feature , as is typically viewed in dn as a disk structure such as a hot spot moves through the emission lines .    @xcite first regarded that the dips in the light curve are caused by eclipse , but the wide widths ( about half an orbital cycle ) and shallow depths ( 0.3mag and 0.1mag ) are not consistent with eclipses .",
    "the light curve is similar to that of the long period ( 7.3hr ) system tt crt @xcite , where the modulations can be explained by ellipsoidal variations due to the k secondary if the mass ratio m@xmath8/m@xmath9 is @xmath101 and the inclination is close to eclipsing ( @xmath1  50 - 65degree ) . the stream flow over the disk for the high mass transfer rates expected for long period systems can create hot spots that contribute to the large amplitude of the ellipsoidal variation .",
    "however , it is surprising that the maximum brightness comes after the deepest minimum , whereas a hot spot is normally expected prior to the deep minimum .",
    "spectroscopy throughout the orbit can provide confirmation of the correct scenario .",
    "this is a well - known su uma type dn ( former name of t leo ) with the explicit detection of several superoutbursts and their corresponding superhumps ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ?",

    "@xcite and @xcite obtained its orbital and superhump periods of 0.05882day ( 1.41hr ) and 0.0604day ( 1.45hr ) , respectively .",
    "there are also other proposed identifications as a wz sge type star @xcite or intermediate polar ( ip ) .",
    "the latter identification was suggested by @xcite and @xcite because of a 414sec period observed in the xmm - newton x - ray light curve that could be the spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "@xcite derived a mean cycle length of 420day for its superoutbursts based on four early eruptions reported in the literature .",
    "there are five known superoutbursts in 1993 , 2005 , 2007 , 2008 and 2009 observed in the optical band @xcite , and one superoutburst in 1988 observed in the uv band @xcite . compared with other typical wz sge type stars ,",
    "the supercycle of qz vir is shorter , and more coherent .    during the 80-day k2-c1 observations in short cadence",
    ", there was no outburst event , but a secular decline with an amplitude of @xmath1  1mag .",
    "aavso data show that a superoutburst began may 13 and lasted until about june 18 ( about 16 days after the start of the k2-c1 observations ) .",
    "so , the decline is consistent with the end of the superoutburst .",
    "quadratic and linear functions were used to normalize the original k2 light curve before and after the data gap of k2-c1 , respectively .",
    "the normalized light curve is shown in figure 2 .",
    "considering the long - cadence sff corrected light curve had an improvement percentage of less than 10% , the following discussions are based on our deduced light curve in short cadence , which shows quasi - periodic modulations with a mean amplitude of @xmath1  0.6mag .",
    "note that this amplitude can occasionally reach up to over 1mag .",
    "moreover , a special flare - like transient with a duration of @xmath1  8day and an amplitude of @xmath1  0.8mag marked by the dash rectangles in figure 2 occurs around bjd2456878 .",
    "the zoomed light curve of this transient shown in the top panel of figure 8 further reveals that this event is also surrounded by other low - level modulations .",
    "although the periodicity of this modulation can not be visibly seen as in j0632 + 2536 , the dft result plotted in the second panel of figure 4 using the program period04 definitely indicates two significant peaks at the close periods of 0.0588day ( 1.41hr ) and 0.0597day ( 1.43hr ) , which are nearly consistent with the previously derived orbital and superhump periods , respectively .",
    "the other peak at the period of 0.0294day ( 0.71hr ) shown in this periodogram is the harmonic of the orbital period .",
    "in addition , we found that a group of peaks at the central period of 7.92hr may be related to the pseudo 6-hr period .    since the decline at the beginning of the k2-c1 light curve is the end of a superoutburst , the fact that the detected period of 1.43hr derived from the whole k2 dataset is a little less than that obtained in the literature can be reasonably explained by the transition from the long superhump period to the short orbital period after the superoutburst .",
    "since the data gap basically separates this k2 light curve into the decline and quiescent parts , the two periodograms for the two parts of light curves shown in the top two panels of figure 9 further verify that the decline is the end of the superoutburst .",
    "the top panel indicates that the decay part of the superoutburst only shows the superhump period .",
    "the middle panel illustrates that the highest peak has been shifted from the superhump to the orbital period in quiescence . besides these two periods",
    ", the quiescent light curve also includes many unknown periods ( sum of these periods may be beat periods ) , which result in the complicated and irregular variations .",
    "thus , we can not obtain the distinct orbital and superhump modulations .",
    "note that the peak at the superhump period does not disappear or become very weak in this plot .",
    "this may imply that the superhump period of 1.43 hr in qz vir is permanent and coexists with the orbital period .",
    "although many periods were detected in quiescence , we can not detect the spin period of the white dwarf at 414sec and its harmonics , as found by @xcite .",
    "the shortest period with a considerably weak power is 18.6min .",
    "additionally , the periodogram for the flare - like transient shown in the ( c ) panel of figure 9 reveals a curious feature in that both orbital and superhump periods nearly vanished , but the higher harmonic of the orbital period is significant .",
    "furthermore , there is another notable peak at a new period of 2.67hr , which is not displayed in the other two panels .      @xcite first classified rz leo as a possible nova in 1918 with a maximum at 10.5mag .",
    "but , the second outburst in 1984 and the strong double - peaked emission lines suggest that rz leo should be a member of wz sge - type stars @xcite . then , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite further proposed that rz leo should be a su uma star due to the detection of superoutbursts lasting 14 days and corresponding superhumps with a period of 0.07616(21)-0.0806(2)day and an amplitude of @xmath1  0.15 - 0.2mag .",
    "the secondary of rz leo is regarded as a normal red dwarf instead of a brown dwarf as implied by the typical wz sge stars @xcite . in the literature , there were 7 recorded outbursts in 1918 , 1935 , 1952 , 1976 , 1984 , 1989 and 2000 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "hence , @xcite estimated that the supercycle of rz leo is approximately ten years . in quiescence ,",
    "the photometric period of 0.0756(12)day derived by @xcite is a little smaller than the spectroscopic period of 0.07651(26 ) day @xcite . @xcite",
    "obtained similar photometric and spectroscopic periods with higher precision , which are 0.0760383(4)day and 0.0761(2)day , respectively .",
    "both periods are smaller than the derived superhump period of 0.07868(19)day @xcite .    in k2-c1 ,",
    "rz leo is another one of three cvs observed in short cadence .",
    "the sff method failed to improve its k2 light curve due to the negative improvement percentage listed in table 1 .",
    "the nearly flat k2 light curve in short cadence shown in the middle panel of figure 2 never shows any long - term variation , but does have regular and low - amplitude oscillations ( @xmath1  0.5mag on average ) in quiescence .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram plotted in the middle panel of figure 4 indicates two notable periods of 0.03801day ( 0.91hr ) and 0.07603day ( 1.82hr ) .",
    "this periodogram is similar to figure 8 of @xcite .",
    "additionally , the pdm method also confirmed this result .",
    "hence , like j0632 + 2536 , the period of 0.07603day with less power should be an authentic period , which agrees with the previous result derived from the double - hump photometric light curves @xcite . furthermore , based on the 82-day k2-c1 data in short cadence",
    ", this period can be improved by the o - c technique due to the high time resolution of the k2 data .",
    "considering that the irregular profile of the second hump seriously distorts the two dips , the maximum time of primary hump should be the best periodic signal for our o - c analysis .",
    "the first maximum time and the period obtained from the periodogram were set to be an initial epoch and period , respectively . a primary ephemeris based on a time baseline over 1000 cycles",
    "can be used to rephase the short - cadence k2 data . however ,",
    "when binning this phased light curve with a phase resolution 0.001 , there is a small zero - drift in phase @xmath1  0.015 due to the incorrect epoch .",
    "the new ephemeris after removing this zero - drift effect was deduced as : @xmath11 with a variance of @xmath12day .",
    "the precision of the period shown in equation ( 2 ) is about one order of magnitude higher than the period derived by @xcite .",
    "figure 10 displays all the o - cs of the maximum times of primary hump based on the ephemeris equation ( 2 ) . by using the new derived period listed in equation ( 2 ) to fold the linearly normalized k2 light curve",
    ", we found that the phased light curve shows very large scatter , @xmath1  0.43mag on average .",
    "compared with the phased light curve derived by @xcite , our smooth binned light curve with higher phase resolution shown in the middle panel of figure 5 distinctly illustrates more details of the orbital light curve including a round bottom at the primary dip and the round tops at the two peaks . a flat bottom at the second dip lasting phase 0.05 ( @xmath1  5.5min ) is a consistent feature .",
    "this phased light curve illustrates a brightening transient event with an amplitude of @xmath1  0.6mag , which is also displayed in the middle panel of figure 8 .",
    "both plots clearly demonstrate that this event takes place at bjd2456845.1 , which is coincident with the original second hump . in the phased light curve ,",
    "the top part of this transient event between phase 0.3 and 0.9 obviously changes the normal second hump .",
    "the complete profile of this transient shown in the plot of time series indicates that its duration is @xmath1  1.88hr , which is a little longer than the orbital period , and",
    "it is composed of a rapid rise with a rate of @xmath1  1.6maghr@xmath13 , a flat peak with a rate of @xmath1  0.05maghr@xmath13 and a slow decline with a rate of @xmath1  0.5maghr@xmath13 .",
    "this event looks like a mini dn outburst with a faster and lower amplitude .",
    "in addition , there is a weak rebrightening event occurring in the decay with a typical luminosity level compared with the other primary peaks .",
    "this event is consistent with the ephemeris of equation ( 2 ) .",
    "so it is a normal primary hump and is marked by a short vertical line in the middle panel of figure 8 .",
    "lbqs1144 + 0111 , an alias of this target , was first observed in the large , bright qso survey ( lbqs , @xcite ) , and classified as a da+dme binary , which is composed of a da type white dwarf and a normal m dwarf star with strong emission features @xcite .",
    "additionally , it was listed in a catalog of spectroscopically identified white dwarfs in the first data release of the sdss ( g=18.09mag , @xcite ) .",
    "although @xcite did not detect any variability in later time - series photometry , it was claimed as a cataclysmic variable named wd1144 + 011 in simbad .",
    "however , its optical spectrum obtained by @xcite , shows many absorption lines and a low blue continuum , which is atypical for a normal cv .",
    "thus , its cv identification is still doubtful .",
    "the continuous k2 light curve in long cadence covering 80 days shows an orbital modulation but no outburst or transient event . there is a long - term rise of the system light after the data gap of k2-c1 .",
    "therefore , we used linear and quadratic functions to normalize the k2 light curves before and after the data gap , respectively . note that a small transient event marked by the dash rectangle in the bottom panel of figure 2 appears at the end of the k2 light curve around bjd2456888 .",
    "the zoomed light curve of this transient shown in the bottom panel of figure 8 illustrates that it is a short - timescale event lasting @xmath1  0.5day , which involves a temporary disappearance of the orbital modulation .",
    "since there is no notice in the data release notes for k2-c1 nor any similar variation in the other cvs in k2-c1 , this appears to be a real feature of wd1144 + 011 .",
    "the orbital modulation with an average amplitude of 0.03mag reappears after this transient event . by using the lomb - scargle periodogram and pdm methods , a highly significant period of 0.40859day ( 9.806hr ) and its harmonics",
    "are found based on the normalized data .",
    "since the k2 light curve can not be used for a reliable o - c analysis like rz leo due to the sparse data points , we attempted to use a sinusoidal function to fit the normalized light curve according to the levenberg - marquardt algorithm . the best least - square fitting curve shown in figure 11",

    "the best fitting period of 0.408680655(1)day in equation ( 3 ) basically accords with the primary period shown in the periodogram . since the sff improvement percentage is 10.6% , we attempted to phase the sff corrected light curve based on the period in equation ( 3 ) and obtained a nearly equal phase gap at a frequency of 20cycle / day ( i.e. , @xmath1  19min interval ) shown in the ( a ) row of figure 12 .",
    "although our normalized light curve folded by the same period shown in the ( c ) row presents a similar gap , the zoomed - in light curve in the right - side panel of the ( c ) row indicates that each section of the phased light curve is smoother than that of the ( a ) row .",
    "in addition , by using the dft method ( period04 program ) , we obtained a new period of 0.408741day ( 9.81hr ) , which only has a small difference 5.2sec from the period listed in equation ( 3 ) . in spite of this small discrepancy ,",
    "the new phased sff corrected light curve shown in the ( b ) row illustrates a distinctly different pattern of a sine - like modulation with a phased period of 0.02day ( i.e. , @xmath1  29.4min ) superimposed on the original phased light curve without any gap .",
    "this modulation is totally invisible in the new phased light curve for the normalized data , which only displays smooth scatter .",
    "note that the modulation period of 29.4min presented in the ( b ) row is exactly the same as the sampling rate of the k2 in lc and one 20th of the folding period of 9.81hr .",
    "therefore , this sine - like modulation derived from the sff corrected data is likely not real since it could be removed after a simple normalization .",
    "the 19-min phase gaps shown in the a ) and c ) rows may be caused by the inaccurate folding period . the binned phased light curve shown in the bottom panel of figure 5 has a slow rise and fast decline .",
    "the long period and the light curve shape imply this system is likely a pre - cv with the modulation caused by the changing view of the m star that is heated by the hot white dwarf .",
    "time resolved spectroscopy throughout the 9.81hr period should show noticeable changes in the emission lines .",
    "this object named usno - b1.01144 - 00115322 ( hereafter usno01144 ) was first listed in the usno - b1.0 catalogue @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that it showed a dn outburst with a duration of  @xmath10  7day and an amplitude of  @xmath10  4mag as observed at ksu astrotel observatory in november , 2009 .",
    "its optical spectra on 2009 november 19 obtained by @xcite show broad balmer absorption lines with a narrow emission core and a weak h@xmath17 emission line in the blue and red wavelengths , respectively .",
    "in addition , the continuum in the blue end is obviously stronger than that in the red end .    during the observations with k2-c0 in long cadence ,",
    "a brightening event was detected around bjd2456770 .",
    "although the k2 light curve shown in figure 1 was incomplete due to missing the beginning part of the outburst , it was enough to confirm that this is a typical normal outburst with an outburst amplitude of @xmath1  3.5mag , which further supports the previous classification of dn .",
    "however , the sff corrected light curve with the significant improvement percentage 209.6% never recorded this brightening event since the sff data just began from bjd2456772.109 , close to the end of this normal outburst . based on the systematic difference between our normalized sap flux and",
    "the sff corrected data , the sff corrected light curve was replotted in the middle panel of figure 1 with the same scale as our deduced k2 light curve .",
    "we found that the large scatter with an amplitude of @xmath1  1mag has been almost eliminated by the sff method .",
    "especially , the sudden introduced large scatters at the end of the smooth decay of normal outburtst can be naturally explained by its faint quiescence .",
    "the plot of the differences between the two light curves illustrate an obvious deviation lasting @xmath1  5days at the end of the decay section , which is caused by the very flat sff light curve . considering that the diagram of the differences between the two light curves in quiescence is basically flat",
    "as shown in the middle panel of figure 1 , the normal outburst with a smooth and consecutive profile presented in our deduced k2 light curve is authentic .",
    "thus , a new and complete k2 light curve of this object can be composed of our deduced part in outburst and the sff corrected part in quiescence . a period search based on this complete k2 light curve only gives the null result .",
    "the three superoutbursts recorded in 2003 , 2008 and 2011 accompanied with superhumps definitely classify uv gem as a su uma - type star with a long superhump period ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the o - c diagram of the superhumps derived by @xcite show a downward quadratic curve covering these three superoutbursts with an extremely negative decline rate of -5.34@xmath1810@xmath19 on the basis of the superhump period of 0.0936day derived from the superoutburst in 2003 .",
    "@xcite estimated that the cycle length of the normal outbursts is @xmath1  13.5day , but there is not enough data to derive the supercycle length @xcite .",
    "until now , only one quiescent spectrum with a weak h@xmath17 emission line and typical continuum covering 4600 - 9000   was obtained by @xcite .",
    "thus , its orbital period is still unclear @xcite    fortunately , a complete normal outburst lasting 5 days with an amplitude of around 3mag occurring around bjd2456788 was detected in k2-c0 . considering that the sff method successfully improved the quiescent light curve of usno01144 , the sff corrected light curve was checked but there was a very low improvement percentage 0.8% for uv gem . in order to clearly demonstrate the coherence of the two light curves",
    ", they are replotted into the same frame and their almost flat differences are shown in the bottom panel of figure 1 except for a systematic shifting @xmath1  0.1mag from bjd2456783 to bjd2456794 , which totally covers the whole outburst .",
    "like usno01144 , the flat differences imply that the normal outburst detected in our deduced light curve is also real .",
    "in addition , the large scatter and the quasi - periodic jitters at the peak and decay parts of the outburst light curve clearly appeared in the sff corrected light curve .",
    "the two lomb - scargle periodograms for our deduced data and the sff corrected data shown in the uv gem ( a ) and ( b ) panels of figure 13 demonstrate that the known 6-hr pseudo periodic signal caused by the regular thrusting event of the kepler satellite is not eliminated in the sff data , but is removed from our deduced data .",
    "additionally , the two significant peaks at the period of 0.086089day ( 2.07hr ) and 0.088342day ( 2.12hr ) , respectively , appeared in the uv gem ( a ) panel of figure 13 .",
    "both periods are less than the orbital period of 0.0895day ( 2.15hr ) listed in the updated cvs catalog ( rkcat7.21 , @xcite ) , that was estimated from the superhump period of 0.0935day ( 2.24hr ) using an empirical relation given by @xcite .",
    "hence , the k2 data allow the first determination of a plausible orbital period for uv gem .",
    "moreover , there is still a weak but analogous frequency feature displayed in the uv gem ( b ) panel of figure 13 . considering that this periodogram is similar to qz vir",
    ", the longer 2.12hr period with less power may be the remaining superhump period after an unrecorded superoutburst .",
    "however , the phased light curve can not be obtained due to the sparse k2 data available in long cadence .      in simbad , this target named 1rxsj111236.7 + 002807 is classified as an x - ray source as it first appeared in the rosat all - sky survey faint source catalogue @xcite , and has a typical cv count rate of 0.02368 .",
    "however , it was regarded as a galaxy ( g=22.46mag ) in the sdss dr 9 in spite of a position deviation of @xmath1  14.8arcsec compared with the coordinates in simbad . recently , the crts classified this target as a cv due to the detection of several transient variations with a nearly 4mag amplitude ( i.e. , 17 - 21mag ) in low time resolution data obtained during the last ten years @xcite .",
    "hence , the faint g - band magnitude listed in the sdss catalog corresponds to quiescence during the sdss observations .",
    "a typical superoutburst lasting 17 days with a weak precursor and an amplitude of @xmath1  5.6mag was detected in the long cadence k2-c1 data .",
    "the converted k2 magnitude is consistent with the previous observations of the crts and the sdss .",
    "although the scatter in the quiescent light curve is not apparent in the upper panel of figure 3 , it is obviously present in the magnitude plot ( i.e. , the log graph ) since quiescence may reach the detection limit of the satellite . considering that the sff method only provides a negative improvement percentage -19.5%",
    ", we can not expect that the scatter in quiescence can be reduced by the sff method . in order to visually display the superhumps on the plateau of the superoutburst",
    ", we used the dotted lines to connect the adjoining data points due to the low time resolution in long cadence .",
    "the zoomed plots in sap flux and kp@xmath4 are shown in the ( a ) and ( b ) panels of figure 14 , respectively .",
    "both diagrams further demonstrate that it is hard to reliably detect the superhump from such sparse time series , which only has 4 - 5 data points in each superhump cycle at most . in spite of this",
    ", we attempted to use a linear function to normalize the plateau in magnitude , which can be described as follow , @xmath20 this can be converted into an exponential function for describing the plateau in sap flux by using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "however , the normalized plateau in magnitude shown in the ( c ) panel of figure 14 shows a quasi - sinusoidal variation with an amplitude of @xmath1  0.05mag and a period of @xmath1  7.6day except for the small deviation at the end of the plateau . after a further normalization by subtracting this sine curve , a flat plateau shown in the ( d ) panel of figure 14 was obtained . based on this final normalized data ,",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram shown in the bottom panel of figure 4 reveals two significant peaks with comparable power at 0.060137day ( 1.44hr ) and 0.30068day ( 0.72hr ) .",
    "however , the pdm method can not find any period from the same data . considering that the minimum orbital period for hydrogen - rich cvs is @xmath1",
    "70min @xcite , it is reasonable to conclude that the smaller period of 0.30068day is only a harmonic , but the superhump period of this object is the other period of 0.060137day due to the lack of peaks at longer periods .",
    "this implies that this object is a short - period su uma type star .",
    "although the superhump period derived from this sparse k2 data may be not very accurate , the k2 light curve in long cadence can definitely confirm the detection of a typical superoutburst and the corresponding superhump with a plausible period of 1.44 hr .",
    "this means that css1112 + 0028 is a su uma type dn close to the period minimum .",
    "note that the known 6-hr pseudo period is also not visible in the periodogram .",
    "further followup observations in higher time resolution are necessary to precisely certify its superhump and orbital periods .",
    "this is a well - known ug gem type dn since 1932 @xcite . @xcite",
    "first obtained its orbital period of 4.38hr , the orbital inclination 43@xmath21 and the mass ratio of 0.44 .",
    "@xcite claimed that there were 7872 observations including 62 normal outbursts for tw vir from 1955 to 1997 .",
    "based on these observations , they derived that the average outburst duration and the quiescent interval of tw vir should be 6 and 22 day by setting the two reference lines at 12.2 and 13.5mag .",
    "besides this optical photometry , there were some detailed uv and ir observations .",
    "it s uv spectrum in outburst taken by the iue shows a p cygnic profile of the civ1550 line , which indicates a strong accretion disk wind @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed other iue spectra when tw vir switched to quiescence , and found that the civ line returned back to a normal emission line with a larger equivalent width ( 145  ) than the balmer lines .",
    "additionally , @xcite obtained a sinusoidal ir light curve with a period of 2.2hr ( i.e. , one - half the orbital period ) and a half amplitude of 0.063mag .",
    "they estimated that the secondary of tw vir is a m3v red dwarf of 0.4 m@xmath22 .    like qz vir and rz leo , tw vir was observed in short cadence with k2-c1 .",
    "the k2 light curve shown in the bottom panel of figure 3 recorded two incomplete normal outbursts and one completed superoutburst lasting 16 days with a typical precursor on the rise to superoutburst .",
    "the amplitude of this superoutburst is @xmath1  4.5mag , which is 0.5mag larger than the following two normal outbursts .",
    "the quiescent interval between them is less than 26 days , which is consistent with the average result derived by @xcite .",
    "the amplitude and the duration of this superoutburst of tw vir are 1.1mag and 1day shorter than those of css1112 + 0028 , respectively . considering that the improvement percentage by the sff method is 16.9% for the light curve in long cadence",
    ", the sff corrected data and our reduced data were replotted in the same diagram like usno01144 and uv gem .",
    "inspection of the bottom panel of figure 3 indicates that the obvious deviations between the two light curves are at the beginning of the time series including the plateau of the superoutburst , where the sff data present larger scatter .",
    "but , the remaining parts of the two light curves are similar .",
    "the two panels illustrate that the sff light curve undergoes an unexpected break - off point near the end of the plateau .",
    "a periodogram for the plateau of the superoutburst based on the sff data is shown in the tw vir ( b ) panel of figure 13 .",
    "a peak at the period of 6hr is the only significant feature , and there is not any signal around the orbital period . for comparison ,",
    "the periodogram of our deduced data in the same data range shown in the tw vir ( a ) panel indicates that the plateau also seriously suffers from the effect of the pseudo 6-hr period .",
    "but , there are some weak peaks around the orbital period of 4.38hr .",
    "the extracted light curves of the 15 cvs observed in the k2-c0 and k2-c1 fields reveal interesting details . j0632 + 2536 , qz vir , rz leo and sdssj1146 were observed only in quiescence while usno01144 , uv gem , css1112 + 0028 and tw vir also show outburst and/or superourtbursts .",
    "the major results from these light curves are listed below .",
    "j0632 + 2536 : a consistent period of 7.78hr derived from the normalized data is likely the orbital period , and the 7.81hr period previously during outburst is likely the superhump period . the phased light curve based on this period shows a regular orbital modulation with two distinct humps and dips superimposed on a long - term variation of system light .",
    "based on the large width and shallow depth of the two dips , combined with our optical spectra showing a prominent k5 star , we regard this object as a moderate inclination cv with ellipsoidal variations in combination with one or more hot spots . a decrease of system light with an amplitude of 0.25mag and a duration of 2.5day was detected during the latter half of the k2-c0 light curve , likely indicating a change in accretion rate .",
    "qz vir : the short cadence k2-c1 data demonstrate the coexistence of orbital and superhump periods in quiescence , which are similar to those in the literature .",
    "a declining light curve with an amplitude of @xmath1  1mag and a duration of @xmath1  25day before the data gap of k2-c1 is connected to the decay of a superoutburst and only one significant peak at the superhump period appears in the periodogram .",
    "additionally , a flare - like transient event in quiescence with an amplitude of @xmath1  0.8mag and a duration of @xmath1  8day was apparent and surrounded by low - level modulations . during this transient event",
    ", the orbital and superhump periods vanished , but the 0.71hr harmonic of the orbital period and a new period of 2.67hr were apparent .",
    "although the spin period of the white dwarf at 414sec detected in x - ray and its harmonics were not detected in the k2 light curve , multi - period variations were present .",
    "rz leo : a new orbital ephemeris based on the 82-day k2-c1 data further confirms the period derived by @xcite .",
    "however , the phased light curve shows a large average scatter of @xmath1  0.43mag .",
    "after binning into 0.001 bins and using our refined ephemeris , we obtained a smooth phased light curve , with primary and secondary minima .",
    "additionally , an unusual brightening event with an amplitude of @xmath1  0.6mag and a duration of @xmath1  1.88hr is apparent in one orbit .",
    "wd1144 + 011 : the k2 light curve in long cadence reveals a strong 5% modulation of the light curve at a period of 9.81hrs .",
    "the analysis is complicated by a beat between this period and the lc sampling rate .",
    "it appears that this system is likely a pre - cv , with the modulation resulting from the changing view of the m dwarf which is heated by the white dwarf .",
    "the light curve shows a peculiar transient event lasting about a half day when the regular modulation almost disappears .",
    "usno01144 : an incomplete normal outburst with a typical amplitude of @xmath1  3.5mag was detected at the beginning of k2-c0 .",
    "this event was totally missed by the start times of the sff corrected data .",
    "however , the sff method greatly reduces the large scatter with an amplitude of @xmath1  1mag during quiescence time .",
    "this outburst event detected by k2-c0 classifies this target as a dn .",
    "uv gem : a complete and typical normal outburst with a duration of 5day and an amplitude of 3mag was observed in k2-c0 .",
    "the sff corrected and our deduced light curves are basically consistent .",
    "the two close periods of 0.086089day and 0.088342day shown in the periodogram are likely the superhump and orbital periods .",

    "<S> there are 15 cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) observed in the first two campaigns of the k2 mission . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the eight cvs showing distinct features are analyzed in detail . among these eight , </S>",
    "<S> modulations during quiescence are evident at the known orbital periods in the suuma stars qzvir and rzleo , and at our newly determined orbital periods of 1rxsj0632 + 2536 and wd1144 + 011 . </S>",
    "<S> the periodogram analysis for the quiescent light curve of qzvir reveals multi - period modulations and the coexistence of orbital and superhump periods . the phased orbital light curves for the other 3 cvs in quiescence display wide ( about half cycle ) and shallow ( @xmath0 0.5mag ) eclipse features . besides these modulations </S>",
    "<S> , their quiescent light curves reveal several transient events : a sudden decrease of system light in 1rxsj0632 + 2536 , a low level flare - like event in qzvir , a short brightening event in rzleo and a temporary disappearance of the orbital modulation in wd1144 + 011 . </S>",
    "<S> the two known dwarf novae uvgem and twvir and the cvs usno - b1.01144 - 00115322 and css130516:111236.7 + 002807 show outbursts , including 1 complete and 3 incomplete normal outbursts and 2 complete superoutbursts . </S>",
    "<S> an incomplete but typical normal outburst confirms the dwarf nova identification of the usno - b1.01144 - 00115322 . </S>",
    "<S> the one complete normal outburst in uvgem possibly provides the orbital period , since its modulations are shorter than the previously observed superhump period . </S>",
    "<S> the superoutbursts of twvir and css130516:111236.7 + 002807 , along with their corresponding superhump periods , indicate that both objects are suuma stars . </S>",
    "<S> the derived superhump period of css130516:111236.7 + 002807 is 1.44hr , implying that this new suuma star is close to the period minimum . </S>"
