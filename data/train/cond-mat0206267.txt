    "the boson fermion ( bf ) model is an example of a microscopic theory of nonconventional superconductivity .",
    "it describes a mixture of itinerant electrons or holes ( fermions ) which interact via charge exchange with a system of immobile local pairs ( hard - core bosons ) . due to this",
    "interactions , bosons acquire finite mass and under proper circumstances might undergo bose condensation transition while fermions simultaneously start to form a broken symmetry superconducting phase .    for the first time",
    "this model has been introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ almost two decades ago @xcite to describe the electron system coupled to the lattice vibrations in a crossover regime , between the adiabatic and antiadiabatic limits .",
    "later it has been formally derived from the hamiltonian of wide band electrons hybridized to the strongly correlated narrow band electron system @xcite .",
    "very recently @xcite the same effective bf model has been derived purely from the two dimensional hubbard model in the strong interaction limit using the contractor renormalization method of morningstar and weinstein @xcite .",
    "some authors have proposed it as a possible scenario for description of high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) . the unconventional way of inducing the superconducting phase in the bf model has been independently investigated in a number of papers @xcite . moreover",
    ", this model reveals also several unusual properties of the normal phase ( for @xmath1 ) with an appearance of the pseudogap being the most transparent amongst them @xcite .",
    "apart of eventual relevance of this model to htsc there are attempts to apply the same type of picture for a description of the magnetically trapped atoms of alkali metals @xcite .",
    "the important question which we want to address in this paper is : what is an influence of disorder on superconductivity of the bf model ?",
    "the conventional @xmath0-wave symmetry bcs - type superconductors are known to be rather weakly affected by paramagnetic impurities @xcite - the fact which is known as `` anderson theorem '' .",
    "nonmagnetic impurities have remarkable detrimental effect on superconductors with the anisotropic order parameters .",
    "magnetic impurities lead to pair - breaking effects which result in a strong reduction of @xmath2 even in @xmath0-wave superconductors . studying the effect of impurities on the superconductors",
    "has always been an established tool for investigation of the internal structure of the cooper pairs .    due to the nonconventional pairing mechanism ( i.e.   exchange of the hard - core bosons between fermion pairs ) it is of a fundamental importance to see how the nonmagnetic impurities ( disorder ) affect the isotropic superconducting phase of the bf model .",
    "previously , such a study has been carried out by robaszkiewicz and pawowski @xcite who considered disorder only in the boson subsystem . using a method of configurational averaging for the free energy ,",
    "authors have shown a strong detrimental effect of disorder on superconductivity .",
    "apart of a reduction of the transition temperature @xmath2 they have also reported a remarkable change of a relative ratio @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we analyze the effect of disorder present in both : fermion and boson subsystems using a different method of the coherent potential approximation .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian of the disordered bf model @xmath4 we use the standard notations for annihilation ( creation ) operators of fermion @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) with spin @xmath7 and of the hard core boson @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) at site @xmath10 .",
    "fermions interact with bosons via the charge exchange interaction @xmath11 which is assumed to be local .",
    "there are two ways in which disorder enters into the consideration . either ( a ) fermions are affected by it and this is expressed by the random site energies @xmath12 , or ( b ) hard core bosons via their random site energies @xmath13 .",
    "to proceed , we apply first the mean field decoupling for the boson fermion interaction @xmath14 which is justified until @xmath11 is small enough in comparison to the kinetic energy of fermions . after decoupling ( [ decoupling ] )",
    "we have to deal with the effective hamiltonian composed of the separate fermion and boson contributions @xmath15 @xcite @xmath16 c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger } c_{j\\sigma }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\sum_{i } \\left (   \\rho_{i}^ { * } c_{i\\downarrow } c_{i\\uparrow } +   \\rho_{i } c_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger } c_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger } \\right ) \\label{h_f } \\\\",

    "the site dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 indicates the disorder induced amplitude fluctuations of the order parameters .      for a given configuration of disorder we can exactly find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues corresponding to the lattice site @xmath10 using a suitable unitary transformation .",
    "statistical expectation values of the number operator @xmath21 and the parameter @xmath22 are given by @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "note , that the site dependent fermion order parameter @xmath20 enters the expression for the boson number operator ( [ nb ] ) and the parameter @xmath22 ( [ rho ] ) . disorder of any subsystem is thus automatically transfered onto the other one .",
    "analysis of the fermion part ( [ h_f ] ) is more cumbersome . to study it we use the nambu representation @xmath26 , @xmath27 and define the matrix green s function @xmath28 .",
    "equation of motion for this function reads @xmath29 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & { { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$g$ } } }   } } ( l , j ; \\omega)= { { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$1 $ } } }   } } \\delta_{ij}. \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the matrix green s function @xmath30 of a clean system @xmath31 ^{-1 }   = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc } \\omega - \\varepsilon_{\\bf k }   + \\mu & -\\rho^ { * } \\\\ -\\rho & \\omega + \\varepsilon_{\\bf k } - \\mu \\end{array } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a global order parameter ( which plays a role of the effective gap in the superconducting fermion subsystem ) , and defining the single site impurity potential @xmath33 as @xmath34 one can write down the following dyson equation for the green s function @xmath35 @xmath36 this green s function depends on the specific disorder configuration . in order to pass through one usually averages it over the all possible configurations .    for carrying out the configurational averaging",
    "we use a method of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "the main idea of cpa is to replace the random potential @xmath37 by some uniform coherent potential @xmath38 .",
    "formally , the green s function which satisfies ( [ dyson ] ) with @xmath37 replaced by @xmath38 is then given ( in the momentum coordinates ) by @xmath39 ^{-1 }   = \\left [ { { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$g$ } } }   } } ^0({\\bf k};\\omega ) \\right ] ^{-1 }   - { { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\sigma$ } } }   } } ( \\omega ) .\\ ] ]    configuration at site @xmath10 is defined by values of the random energies @xmath12 , @xmath13 - we shall symbolically denote it by @xmath40 .",
    "any of possible configurations @xmath41 can occur with some probability @xmath42 , and of course these probabilities are normalized @xmath43 .",
    "a particle propagating through the medium characterized by the coherent potential @xmath44 is thus , at site @xmath10 , scattered with probability @xmath45 by the potential @xmath46 . for a chosen configuration @xmath41 of the site @xmath10",
    "the conditionally averaged local greens function is given by @xmath47 ^{-1 }   = \\left [ { { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$g$ } } }   } } ^{cpa}(i , i;\\omega)\\right ] ^{-1 }   - \\left [ { { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$v$ } } }   } } ^{(\\alpha)}_{i } - { { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\sigma$ } } }   } } ( \\omega ) \\right ] .\\ ] ] this green s function @xmath48 describes the system in which all sites , except one indicated by @xmath10 , are described by the coherent potential @xmath38 . in cpa",

    "it is instructive to investigate the disorder separately for fermion and boson subsystems .",
    "let us start with fermion disorder @xmath12 .",

    "@xcite the diagonal disorder affects mainly a diagonal part of the matrix green s function @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , even for no disorder acting directly in bosonic subsystem the boson order parameter @xmath62 in equation ( [ rho ] ) does depend on the site index via fermion order parameter @xmath20 .",
    "however , we expect this _ induced _ disorder to be weak and neglect it .",
    "this allows us to show how disorder in fermionic subsystem only , affects @xmath54 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the coherent potential vanish . due to the general symmetry",
    "@xmath63 @xcite we can simplify the self - energy matrix to @xmath64 @xmath65 can be found from the cpa equation ( [ cpa_constraint ] ) which , for a normal phase , takes a well known form @xcite @xmath66^{-1}+f(\\omega ) } + \\frac{c}{\\left[\\sigma_{11}(\\omega)-\\varepsilon_{0 } \\right]^{-1}+f(\\omega ) } = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 .",

    "we choose for our study a case of weak boson fermion interaction @xmath76 ( in units of the initial fermion bandwidth ) and total concentration of charge carriers @xmath77 .",
    "figure ( [ fig0 ] ) shows how @xmath2 of a clean system depends on position of the boson level .",
    "there are three distinguishable regimes @xcite of relative occupancy by bosons and fermions .",
    "superconducting correlations are of course most visible when chemical potential is close to @xmath78 .",
    "we choose the value @xmath79 to be close to optimal value of transition temperature and to have comparable amount of fermions and bosons . for computations we use the 2d square lattice dispersion -",
    "the van hove singularity is safely distant from the fermi energy for the above parameters .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we plot the transition temperature @xmath2 , calculated from equation ( [ tc19 ] ) against concentration @xmath57 for several values of @xmath69 . with an increase of concentration @xmath57 of scattering centers we notice a gradual reduction of the critical temperature .",
    "this tendency can be understood by looking at the behavior of the fermion density of states at the fermi energy @xmath80 .",
    "disorder is responsible for renormalization of the low energy sector and these low energy states are involved in forming the superconducting type correlations . as shown in the bottom panel there is additional effect coming from the rearrangement of occupations @xmath70 and @xmath72 . with an increasing concentration @xmath57 the fermion band",
    "is shifted toward higher energies and the system is then mainly occupied by bosons ( so called , the local pair lp limit ) .    for negative values of @xmath69",
    "the disorder shows stronger influence on @xmath54 . on one hand",
    "we have again a direct effect of the renormalized density of states ( see @xmath80 in the middle panel of figure 3 ) . on the other hand , with an increase of @xmath57 for any negative value of @xmath69 the fermion band and the position of the chemical potential drift to - wards lower energies .",
    "as its consequence the number of fermions increases and the number of bosons decreases .",
    "effectively we thus approach the bcs limit where transition temperature diminishes very fast if @xmath78 goes above @xmath81 ( check for example the curves for @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "the strong disorder in fermion subsystem makes the pairing mechanism almost ineffective at all .",
    "in figure [ fig3 ] we plot @xmath2 versus ( positive ) @xmath69 for several concentrations @xmath57 .",
    "again , @xmath2 roughly follows variation of the density of states @xmath84 which is shown in the bottom panel . as discussed above for large values of concentration @xmath57 and large positive @xmath69 the system",
    "is mainly filled by bosons ( the lp limit ) so there is some finite @xmath2 even when @xmath85 is far below the fermion band , this is an artifact of the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "behavior of @xmath2 with respect to negative values of @xmath69 can be easily deduced from the figure 3 so we skip this illustration .    in summary we notice that change of the transition temperature @xmath2 caused by weak disorder in fermion system is controlled mainly by modification of the low lying energy states .",
    "this is in accord with the anderson theorem for spin singlet @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "however , additional influence comes from redistribution of particle spectrum and their relative occupancy and such effects are dominant for large values of impurity concentration @xmath57 and for their large scattering strength @xmath86 . in this limit",
    "the boson - fermion exchange becomes ineffective .",
    "now we turn attention to a case when boson energies are random @xmath87 and , for simplicity , assume no fermion disorder i.e.  @xmath58 for all the lattice sites .",
    "the scattering potential ( [ eq23 ] ) reduces then to @xmath88 with @xmath89 } { 2\\gamma_{l}}\\ ] ] and @xmath90 induces fluctuations of the pairing strengths @xmath91 in the fermion subsystem . to some extent , this situation reminds the negative @xmath92 hubbard model @xcite for which the random local attraction @xmath93 leads to the following scattering matrix @xmath94 we see that in our case the role of a random pairing potential @xmath95 is played by @xmath96 given in equation ( [ f_l ] ) .",
    "there are two extreme limits , as far as the effectiveness of the random boson energy @xmath97 is concerned    * for small ( on the scale of fermion - boson interaction @xmath11 ) fluctuations of @xmath98 , effect of the disorder becomes negligible unless the chemical potential is pinned to the boson level @xmath99 , when the amplitude of the pairing potential is controlled by @xmath100/2x_{l}$ ] and is usually uniform except at very low temperatures @xmath101 when @xmath102 * for large fluctuations of @xmath98 one obtains @xmath103      / \\left ( \\delta_{b } + e_{l } -2\\mu \\right)$ ] .    to analyze effects of the disorder in boson subsystem",
    "we use a two pole distribution @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "the boson energy is @xmath105 with an equal probability @xmath106 .",
    "figure ( [ fig4 ] ) shows critical temperature @xmath2 , calculated from equation ( [ x ] ) , as a function of energy @xmath107 by which the boson energy is split .",
    "strong dependence of @xmath54 on disorder is a combined effect of the density of states , the fluctuating interactions and the changes in concentration of carriers .    to estimate",
    "what influence comes only from the renormalization of the effective pairing we plot in figure [ fig6 ] the normalized transition temperature denoted by @xmath54 and the normalized averaged @xmath108 for the parameters given above ( left panel ) , and for a fully symmetric case of the bf model ( right panel ) .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath109 is the bcs - type estimate of the effect of changes in the effective pairing due to disorder @xmath110 a general trend observed in figure [ fig6 ] is that the average effective interaction @xmath111 decreases with increasing disorder , even though the bar fermion - boson interaction @xmath11 remains constant .",
    "this decreasing pairing interaction is the only factor responsible for a behavior of @xmath54 versus @xmath107 in the right panel .",
    "we notice absence of the bcs - like exponential scaling which is due to unconventional pairing in the bf model .    in the left panel , corresponding to the above studied case @xmath112 , @xmath113 , we notice a larger discrepancy between the pairing amplitude and @xmath2 . with an increase of @xmath107",
    "the transition temperature is much strongly reduced than in the symmetric case .",
    "this effect has to be assigned to redistributions of particle occupancies . at large values of @xmath107",
    "we have practically only hard core boson particles in the system , and they can not induce superconductivity among fermions whose fraction becomes very small .    in the previous study @xcite authors have used the same bimodal distribution of random boson energies . they have found a strong reduction of @xmath2 near @xmath114 which agrees well with our data shown in figure 6 .",
    "moreover , the authors have reported that disorder affects the ratio @xmath115 which changes from @xmath116 ( for a clean system @xcite ) to the standard bcs result @xmath117 at large @xmath107",
    ". simple explanation of this effect can be offered .",
    "the boson energy ( which is split by @xmath118 ) is for sufficiently large @xmath107 partly in the lp limit ( for @xmath119 ) and partly in the bcs limit ( if @xmath120 ) .",
    "the second one contributes with the standard bcs value if @xmath121 is large enough ( see e.g.  fig .",
    "9 in ref .",
    "the randomness of the site energies of both , fermions and bosons , has a strong effect on superconducting phase of the bf model .",
    "weak disorder in the fermion subsystem affects the superconducting transition temperature mainly via rescaling the low energy states which are involved in the the formation of the cooper pairs .",
    "therefore @xmath54 roughly follows the density of states at the fermi energy . for sufficiently large disorder @xmath69",
    "there appears some critical concentration @xmath57 at which @xmath2 may eventually drop to zero .",
    "disorder in the boson subsystem has a much more fine influence on superconductivity .",
    "randomness of boson energies is transformed directly into randomness of the pairing strength .",
    "effectively physics of the disordered bf model becomes similar to that of the random negative @xmath92 hubbard model @xcite .",
    "even the relatively small fluctuations of the boson energies show up their strong detrimental effects on superconductivity .    in a simple minded picture one can envision this situation as a random change between various regimes of superconductivity . depending on a value of @xmath122 the boson energy @xmath123 can be either far below the fermi energy ( the lp limit ) , or far above the fermi energy ( the bcs limit ) .",
    "each of such random configurations contributes with a different strength of superconducting correlations . on average ,",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath54 strongly diminishes and practically disappears if the amplitude of the randomly fluctuating boson energies @xmath121 is large enough .    in summary ,",
    "our calculations show that disorder strongly affects the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase of the bf model .",
    "this apparent contradiction with anderson theorem can be understood because of a change of the effective pairing interaction induced by disorder , and this effect is contrary to the anderson s main assumption @xcite .    to compare our results with experimental data on high temperature superconductors",
    "one has to consider the @xmath124-wave superconducting order parameter .",
    "this type of a symmetry arises in a natural way according to the recent derivation of the bf model @xcite .",
    "effect of disorder on such anisotropic superconducting phase of the bf model is outside the scope of the present paper and will be discussed elsewhere .",
