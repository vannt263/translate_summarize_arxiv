    "in @xmath5dimensional spacetimes the electric - magnetic duality symmetry of the maxwell equations is an important property which can not be satisfied in other dimensions unless different form fields other than @xmath6forms are introduced .",
    "for this reason a dyonic solution admits a meaningful interpretation only in @xmath4 .",
    "the reissner - nordestrom ( rn ) solution constitutes in this regard the best example which has both electric and magnetic solutions in a symmetric manner . in other dimensions ( @xmath7 ) similar duality properties can , in principle , be defined as well but physical interpretation corresponding to electric and magnetic fields turn out to be rather abstract . for such reasons , in order  to avoid complications due to the absence of a tangible duality , pure electric or pure magnetic solutions seemed to attract considerable attention .",
    "this amounts to only half of the maxwell equations , the other half being trivially satisfied . from this token",
    "we wish to resort here to the pure magnetic solutions which yield a completely solvable class without much effort . from the physical side ,",
    "occurrence of pure and very strong magnetic fields associated with astronomical objects such as magnetars motivate us to search for such solutions in general relativity .",
    "it was melvin , who first studied such cylindrically symmetric parallel magnetic lines of force remaining in equilibrium under their mutual gravitational attraction in @xmath4@xcite .",
    "later on , generalized version of the melvin s magnetic universe was also considered@xcite .",
    "the melvin universe is invariant under rotation and translation along the @xmath8 axis orthogonal to the polar plane @xmath9 .",
    "thorne popularized the melvin universe further by showing its absolute stability against small radial perturbations@xcite . due to this stability property",
    "it can be presumed that astrophysical objects emitting strong beams of magnetic fields may everlast in an accelerating universe .",
    "additionally , in @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 dimensional @xcite cases also pure magnetic field solutions were found and their energy content investigated @xcite .",
    "pure magnetic solutions in higher dimensions are also known to exist in string , lovelock , yang - mills , born - infeld and other theories @xcite .    in this paper , we present in a particular cylindrically symmetric metric ansatz , a class of non - singular , source - free , static , pure magnetic solutions to einstein - maxwell ( em ) equations in all dimensions . in a different metric ansatz these solutions were known previously @xcite .",
    "our principal aim is to investigate the stability of such magnetic universes against time dependent small radial perturbations and explore the possible role of dimensionality of spacetime in such matters .",
    "it has been known for a long time that for @xmath0 these kind of magnetic solutions are all stable @xcite .",
    "we verify these results once more in a different metric ( i.e. non canonical ) ansatz with supplement of the @xmath3 case .. we show that for @xmath0 the metrics are stable against small perturbations at both near axis @xmath8 and at far distance away from @xmath8 .",
    "we observe also that when @xmath3 these two regions behave differently .",
    "namely , the metric can be made stable at @xmath12 or , at @xmath2 , but not simultaneously , which we phrase as weakly stable .",
    "the solutions justify once more the impossibility of cylindrical magnetic field lines implosion and therefore formation of such black holes .",
    "we investigate the time - like ( @xmath13,with fixed polar angle ) and null ( @xmath14 ) geodesics for neutral particles numerically . only for @xmath4 and @xmath11",
    "we were able to obtain exact integrals , albeit in non - invertible forms , of the geodesics equation . in each case a confinement of geodesics is observed to take place near the central region . due to its physical importance we consider also the time - like geodesics of a charged particle .",
    "it turns out that such geodesics can not be confined and in their proper time they diverge to infinity .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii  we present our metric , field equations and solve them in @xmath15dimensions",
    ". perturbation analysis of our system follows in section iii .",
    "geodesics motion is studied in section iv .",
    "our results are summarized in conclusion which appears in section v.",
    "our @xmath15dimensional static , cylindrically symmetric line element ansatz is given by    @xmath16    in which @xmath17 is a function of @xmath18 to be found and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constant parameters .",
