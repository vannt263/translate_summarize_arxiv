    "the artificial marriage of ferromagnetic and semiconducting properties is one of the main motivations behind the creation and study of diluted magnetic semicondcutors ( dms ) focused on ( iii , mn)v materials .",
    "this effort is being fueled , in large part , by the endless demand for technological advances in our society whose global interdependence in communications and technology is evident throughout our daily activities .",
    "moore s law , predicting an exponential growth of computational ability , is now believed to be in perryl and there is a need for a new technological revolution if the fast pace of technology is to be mantained",
    ".    such a technological revolution will take place if three major goals can be achieved in the development of ferromagnetic ( iii , mn)v materials : i ) room temperature ferromagnetism , ii ) dependence of transport and optical properties on the magnetic state , and iii ) that the materials mantain their fundamental semiconducting characteristics , i.e. strong sensitivity to doping , external fields , and light , and are compatible and integrable with conventional ( non - magnetic ) micro- and opto - electronic semiconductor technologies . since the first observation of ferromagnetism at low temperatures in the ( iii , mn)v semicondcutors in the early nineties , @xcite steady progress has been taking place in each of these major fronts .",
    "more importantly , over the last five years , jumpstarted by the discovery of ferromagnetism in ( ga , mn)as with ferromagnetic temperatures in excess of 100 k , @xcite the efforts in this field have increased dramatically in several coordinated fronts , both experimental and theoretical .",
    "this rapid research has yielded many advances , prompting the need for an overall review of at least several fast evolving parts of this scientific effort . in this article",
    "we discuss transport and magento - optical properties of these materials focusing on the metallic regime and on theoretical approaches based on the effective hamiltonian model which have been succesful in obtaining qualitative and quantitative understanding of various transport characteristics of these systems .",
    "other important areas , such as the insulating low - doping regime have been covered by other reviews.@xcite furthermore , we will narrow our focus on the most widely studied and well understood materials , ( ga , mn)as and ( in , mn)as , only mentioning briefly some of the current prevailing ideas in regards to the much lesser understood ones such as the mn - doped nitrides or phosphides .    as in any review , a preference must be given to the more relevant publications containing the most recent developments and the ones which have had the largest impact in understanding these complex materials . unless the reference section is equal in length to the actual review , it is impossible to cite every contribution to this field . to remedy omissions that may have partly originated from the authors own work perspective",

    "[ theory ] we briefly discuss the theoretical model used and its experimental basis to describe the metallic regime . sec .",
    "[ transport ] reviews the transport properties of dms such as diagonal resisticity , magneto - resistance anisotropy , and anomalous hall effect .",
    "[ optics ] covers the different optical and magneto - optical properties of the systems such as optical absorption , magnetic - circular diachroism , raman scattering , and cyclotron resonance .",
    "a short summary and outlook with different open questions is given in section v.      the basic idea behind creating these novel ferromagnetic materials is simple : based on the lower valence of mn , substituing mn in a ( iii , v ) semiconductor for the cations can dope the system with holes ; beyond a concentration of 1% there are enough induced holes to mediate a ferromagnetic coupling between the local @xmath0 magnetic moments provided by the strongly localized 3d@xmath1 electrons of mn and a ferromagnetic ordered state can ensue .",
    "this rudamentary but generally correct picture of ferromagnetism in many (",
    "iii , mn)v materials is of course aquired by peacing together the different experimental results obtained through different characterization techniques of the materials .",
    "the simplicity of the model hides within it a cornucopia of physical effects present in these materials such as metal - insulator transitions , carrier mediated ferromagnetism , disorder physics , magneto - resistance effects , magneto - optical effects , intricate coupled magnetization dynamics , post - growth dependent properties , etc .    in any doped semiconductor , an understanding of its properties",
    "must be preceeded by a study of the doping impurities . since ,",
    "in this case , the mn impurity dopants provide the local magnetic moments responsible for ferromagetism and , at the same time , provide the hole carriers which mediate the exchange coupling between the impurities themselves , understanding the nature of the impurities and the different states that they induce is even more fundamental in order to establish a relevant theoretical model .",
    "under equilibrioum growth conditions , the solubility of mn in iii - v semicondcutor crystals has an upper limit of 0.1 % . beyond this concentration phase separation and",
    "surface segregation takes place . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "low - temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( lt - mbe ) technique was applied leading to the first succesful growth of inas and gaas based dms.@xcite the most common and stable position of mn in the host semiconductor lattice is on the ga site .",
    "@xcite    an important initial question is what is the neutral state of the ga - substitutional mn impurity .",
    "experimentally , through electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) and optical measurements,@xcite for even very few percentage of mn ( lower by an order of magnitude than the concentration marking the matal - insulator transition ) the only impurity level observed is the d5-mn@xmath2 ionized state , indicating that indeed the strong localized 3d@xmath1 electrons with total spin @xmath0 are a good starting point for theoretical models .",
    "the corresponding 3d@xmath1 plus a weakly bound hole neutral state is observed experimentally only within a narrow range of mn concentrations due to a complete compensation in the low mn doping regime and due to the mott insulator - to - metal transition at high doping .",
    "other candidates for the mn neutral impurity such as 3d@xmath3 states , important for double - exchange models to be applicable , are not observed experimentally.@xcite furthermore , the itinerant holes originating from the mn acceptor level have also been observed through photoemission experiments @xcite to be associated with the ones of the host semiconductor valence band , i.e. they have as 4p - character , which provides further evidence for the shallow acceptor nature of the substitutional mn impurity in gaas and inas .",
    "the other impurities present because of the non - equilibrium growth process , as - antisites and mn - interstitials , compensate the induced holes and therefore reduce the free carrier concentration with respect to the substitutional - mn density . annealing procedures , at temeratures slightly lower than growth temperature , have shown a reduction of the ammount of compensation.@xcite the initial procedure @xcite has now been modified by different groups @xcite and the carrier concentration can actually be tuned precisedly through resistance - monitored annealing .",
    "@xcite two possible mechanism for the reduction of compensation have been considered : either the number of as - antisites is reduced through migration of as atoms to their correct sites , or the mn - interstitials migrate to the surface or to the substitutional sites .",
    "early theoretical models assumed the former scenario , however , a recent key rutherford backscattering experiment@xcite has shown that it is the reduction of mn - interstitials and their out - diffusion to the surface @xcite which is responsible for lowering the ammount of compensation .      besides the experimental results revieling what is happening in the complicated annealing process and the nature of the impurities , there are other experimental observations that provide key clues for understanting the origins and fundamental properties of ( ga , mn)as and ( in , mn)as dms :    \\a ) the ferromagnetic behavior of dms materials is only observed above a critical doping level of about 1% .",
    "@xcite at lower doping the compensation is almost complete and the mediating carriers needed to exchange - couple the localized mn moments are not present and therefore no ferromagnetic ordering occurs .",
    "\\b ) the carrier - induced ferromagnetic nature of the ordered state has been demonstrated by field - effect ( in , mn)as experiments @xcite where the carrier concentration was tuned by a gate and the corresponding critical temperature was modified accordingly .",
    "\\c ) strain effects , due to the lattice mismatch between the dms layer and the substrate , influence the magnetic anisotropy of the ferromagnetic state .",
    "it has been shown that the ferromagnetic easy axis can be along the growth direction or in the plane depending on whether the strain is tensile or compressive .",
    "@xcite such phenomena are interpreted in terms of well known strain effects in the spin - orbit coupled valence bands of the host semiconductor .",
    "\\c ) both magneto - optical effects , e.g. magnetic circular diachroism ( mcd),@xcite and resistivity measurements above the critical temperature,@xcite indicate an anti - ferromagnetic coupling between the local 3d@xmath1 electrons and the valence hole .",
    "this so - called kinetic - exchange interactions originates from the hybridization between the mn 3d - orbitals and the neighboring as 4p - orbitals and is much larger than the pure coulomb exchange interaction.@xcite    \\e ) in transport measurements , a large anomalous - hall effect ( ahe ) ( see sec .",
    "[ ahe ] ) completely dominates the low - field off - diagonal resistance coefficient .",
    "the strong intrinsic spin - orbit coupling present in the host semiconductor valence band can account for the measured magnitude and sign of the ahe .",
    "there are of course many other relevant experiments which are not higlighted above which must be taken into account",
    ". however the interpretation of some or most of them are still being debated , since they seem to depend critically on the annealing procedures and can be interpreted in several ways .",
    "the above results are considered to be general and well established and will likely not change in the newly grown samples as the materials development progresses .",
    "the modeling of a collective behavior of interacting electrons is a complicated task and , in many instances , must be guided by experimental evidence of the low energy degrees of freedom in order to obtain a correct minimal model which will capture the observed effects and will make useful predictions . with this in mind , there are typically three approaches , somewhat complementary , used to describe dms systems : first principles density - functional theory ( dft ) and microscopic tight - binding models , effective hamiltonian models , and lattice models .",
    "dft is an important tool for studying microscopic origins of ferromagnetism through calculations of electronic , magnetic , and structural ground - state properties.@xcite a local - density - approximation ( lda ) of the dft , combined with disorder - averaging coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) or supercell approach , has been used successfully to address physical parameters of ( iii , mn)v dms that are derived from total - energy calculations , such as the lattice constants,@xcite and formation and binding energies of various defects.@xcite however , in mn - doped dms , lda fails to account for strong correlations that suppress fluctuations in the number of electrons in the d - shell . as a result ,",
    "the energy splitting between the occupied and empty d - states is underestimated which leads to an unrealistically large d - state local dos near the top of the valence band and to an overestimate of the strength of the sp - d hybridization.@xcite this shortcomings have been corrected recently by lda+u and self - interaction corrected lda schemes , which account for correlations among mn 3d electrons , and have been used to obtain more realistic energy spectra and show agreement with the experimental observation that the valence holes have mostly as 4p - character.@xcite    a practical approach , that circumvents some of the complexities of this strongly - correlated many - body problem is the microscopic tight - binding ( tb ) band - structure theory . within the model , local changes of the crystal potential at mn and other impurities",
    "are represented by shifted atomic levels .",
    "a proper parameterization of these shifts , of the hubbard correlation potential that favors single occupancy of the localized d - orbitals , the hund potential forcing the five d - orbital spins to align , and of the hopping amplitudes between neighboring atoms provides correct band gap for the host iii - v semiconductor and an appropriate exchange splitting of the mn d - levels .",
    "the tb model is a semi - phenomenological theory , however , it shares the virtue with first principles approaches of treating disorder microscopically .",
    "the decoherence of bloch quasiparticle states or effects of doping and disorder on the strength of the sp - d exchange coupling and effective mn - mn interaction are among the problems that have been analyzed using this tool .",
    "@xcite    in the metallic regime , where the largest critical ferromagnetic temperatures are achieved ( for doping levels above 1.5% @xcite ) , semi - phenomenological models that are built on bloch states for the band quasiparticles , rather than localized basis states appropriate for the localized regime,@xcite provide the natural starting point for a model hamiltonian which reproduces many of the observed experimental effects . recognizing that the length scales associated with holes in the dms compounds are still long enough , a @xmath4 envelope function description of the semiconductor valence bands is appropriate .",
    "since for many properties , e.g. anomalous hall effect and magnetic anisotropy , it is necessary to incorporate intrinsic spin - orbit coupling in a realistic way , the six - band ( or multiple - band , in general ) kohn - luttinger ( kl ) @xmath5 hamiltonian that includes the spin - orbit split - off bands is desirable .",
    "@xcite the approximation of using the kl hamiltonian to describe the free holes is based primarely in the shallow acceptor picture demonstrated by the experiments @xcite in ( ga , mn)as and ( in , mn)as and must be re - examined for any other dms materials that this model is applied to .    besides the kl hamiltonian parameters of the host iii - v compound which have long been established,@xcite the phenomenological part of the strategy follows from asserting , rather than deriving , the localized nature of the mn d - orbital moments and from parameterizing the sp - d hybridization by an effective exchange constant @xmath6 .",
    "the localization assumption is again verified by electron resonance experiments @xcite and the value of @xmath6 is obtained from resistivity measurements in the paramagnetic regime @xcite and mcd measurements .",
    "@xcite hence , the effective hamiltonian considered within this model is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the six - band ( multiple - band ) kohn - luttinger ( kl ) @xmath5 hamiltonian , @xcite the second term is the short - range antiferromagnetic kinetic - exchange interaction between local spin @xmath9 at site @xmath10 and the itinerant hole spin ( a finite range can be incorporated in more realistic models ) , and @xmath11 is the scalar scattering potential representing the difference between a valence band electron on a host site and a valence band electron on a mn site and the screened coulomb interaction of the itinerant electrons with the ionized impurities .",
    "several approximations can be used to vastly simplify the above model , namely , the virtual crystal approximation ( replacing the spatial dependence of the local mn moments by a constant average ) and the mean field theory description.@xcite in the metallic regime , the disorder can be treated by a born approximation or by more sophisticated , exact - diagonalization or monte - carlo methods .  @xcite the effective hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ heff ] allows to use standard electron - gas theory tools to account for hole - hole coulomb interactions .",
    "this envelope function approximation model is also suitable for studying magnetic semiconductor heterostructures , like superlattices , quantum wells and digitally doped layers.@xcite the validity of such semi - phenomenological hamiltonian , which does not contain any free parameters , must be confirmed ultimately by experiments .",
    "its accurate description of many thermodynamic and transport properties of metallic ( ga , mn)as samples , such as the measured transition temperature,@xcite the anomalous hall effect,@xcite the anisotropic magnetoresistance,@xcite , the magneto - crystalline anisotropy,@xcite the spin - stiffness @xcite , the ferromagnetic domain wall widths , @xcite the magnetic dynamic damping coefficients , @xcite and the magneto - optical properties , @xcite has proven the merit of this effective hamiltonian approach .",
    "one has to keep in mind , however , that as any semi - phenomenological model it may fail to capture the correct physics that leads to the ferromagnetic phase in some materials or in a certain range of parameter values .",
    "such models can only be verified by careful comparison with experiments and tested through their predictions and agreement with experimetnts .",
    "for example , mn - doped nitride and phosphide compounds or insulating dms samples with low concentration of mn ions require a theoretical description that goes beyond the picture of the host band quasiparticles that are weakly hybridized with the localized mn d - electrons . particularly nitrates",
    "are not believed to be well modeled by this semi - phenomenological hamiltonian since mn is a deep acceptors in this case and and charge fluctuations on the mn d - levels may play important role .",
    "there has also been theoretical work on ( iii , mn)v dms materials based on a still simpler model where holes are assumed to hop only between mn acceptor sites , where they interact with the mn moments via phenomenological exchange interactions.@xcite these models have the advantage of approaching the physics of the insulating dilute mn limit , and can also be adapted to include the holes that are localized on other ionized defects besides the mn acceptors through dynamical mean field ( or cpa ) techniques .",
    "the free - parameter nature of this phenomenological approach and their oversimplified eletronic structure allows to make only qualitative predictions , however , and the models are also not appropriate for studying the high @xmath12 metallic samples .",
    "the different transport coefficients of dms and their magnetic , temperature , and material composition dependance have been the most important and widely used characterization tools of dms . besides the diagonal resistivity which indicates metal - insulator transitions and possible critical behavior at the ferromagnetic transition temperature , other material transport properties such as anisotropic magnetoresistance , anomalous and ordinary hall effect , and giant magnetoresistance have been used to both characterize and test the different theoretical models of dms materials . in this section",
    "we consider the diagonal conductivity general features , how the exchange coupling between the localized moments and free carriers is extracted within the paramagnetic regime , the doping and carrier concentration conductivity dependence at low temperatures , the anisotropic magnetoresistance , and the anomalous hall effect . throughout , we will focus on the comparison of theoretical models ( mainly the semi - phenomenological effective hamiltonian model relevant to the metallic regime ) to the different experimental observations .",
    "dms materials exhibit an insulating or metallic behavior ( defined by the resistivity in the limit of zero temperature ) depending on its doping level and post - growth annealing procedures . in as - grown samples , metallic behavior",
    "is typically observed for a range of 2 - 5% mn doping and an insulating behavior for higher and lower doping than this range.@xcite in addition to this metal - insulator quantum transition , the resistivity as a function of temperature typically exhibits a peak or shoulder near the ferromagnetic transition temperature for both insulating ( peak ) and metallic ( shoulder ) samples .",
    "@xcite the non - monotonic behavior near @xmath12 is typically associated with critical - scattering but so far no theory has been developed which explains such behavior in a qualitative or quantitative way . typically the fisher - langer theory of correlated fluctuations is invoked , however , it predicts an infinite derivative of the resistivity at @xmath12 , which is clearly not the case in any studied ( ga , mn)as dms sample . there exists also a drastic reduction of the resistivity upon annealing , associated with the increase of the carrier concentration and to a lesser extent a reduction of the disorder scatterers .",

    "this so called side - jump , as in the luttinger formalism , was independent of the scattering potential , leaving one with the strange notion that an exterinsic scattering mechanism resulted in an intrinsic property . after putting this contribution in a boltzman type of formalism he obtained a result which was four orders of magnitde lower than the karplus and luttinger intrinsic result .",
    "he then argued that the intrinsic spin - orbit coulping of the system increases this side - jump scattering by such factor . in his case",

    "a similar type of formalism was put forth by lyo and holstein @xcite claiming similar results but ignoring , for some unknown reason , intrinsic non - vanishing contributions of karplus and luttinger .",

    "within such models , the relative importance of the side - jump / intrinsic contribution @xmath97 ( which are the same magnitude but of opposite sign depending on the limits @xcite ) to the skew - scattring contribution @xmath98 depends on the nature of the scatterers ( only through the skew - scattering dependence ) . for scattering from ionized impurities",

    "this can be achieved by starting from the dirac representation and taking the weak relativistic limit after treating disorder in the usual fashion . in this way ,",
    "any spin - orbit coupling contribution comes naturally from the dirac representation and therefore is automatically taken into account . on the other hand , if one starts from the pauli hamiltonian , an inmediate question arises : which vertex corrections capture the different contributions to the anomalous hall effect ?",

    "taking into consideration the confusion generated by the possible relevance of the side - jump scattering mechanism , several researchers have chosen to focus instead on the original intrinsic contribution to the ahe proposed by karplus and luttinger @xcite and ignore impurity scattering all together or simply include its effects through the born approximation which introduces a finite quasiparticle lifetime . in dms , e.g. , this approach is partly motivated by the strong intrinsic spin - orbit coupling in the host valence bands that makes much of the above theoretical discussions inapplicable since they relied on the perturbation treatement of the spin - orbit coupling .",
