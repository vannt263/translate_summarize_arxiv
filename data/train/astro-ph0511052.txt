    "recent radio  optical observations of quasars have found that their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are not significantly different from those of lower redshift sources implying no sed evolution , and hence no significant changes in the energy production mechanism of agn are observed ( e.g. , see carilli et al .",

    "boller et al . (",

    "1997 ; leighly 1999 ) . strong correlations between fwhm(h@xmath21 ) and the  photon index in both the soft and hard  bands are also exhibited by higher luminosity nearby ( _ z_0.5 ) quasars ( e.g. , laor et al .  1997 ; porquet et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "brandt & boller ( 1998 ) and laor ( 2000 ) have suggested that the strong @xmath2fwhm(h@xmath21 ) correlation may be a consequence of a fundamental correlation between @xmath2 and the accretion rate , since fwhm(h@xmath21 ) is considered to be an accretion - rate indicator in agn ( e.g. , boroson & green 1992 ; porquet et al .",
    "such a correlation may be expected if the bulk of the emitted energy is shifted into higher energies for higher accretion rates .",
    "the use of fwhm(h@xmath21 ) as an accretion - rate indicator relies on reverberation - mapping studies that found a strong correlation between the broad - line region ( blr ) size and luminosity in agn ( e.g. , kaspi et al .",
