    "the rapid advance of magnetoelectronics and spintronics in recent years has given a strong boost in the search for novel magnetic materials , as are the half - metallic ferromagnets .",
    "these are spin polarized materials , which exhibit the property of having a metallic density of electron states for the one spin direction ( usually majority spin ) , while there is a band gap around the fermi level , @xmath0 , for the states of the opposite spin . this _ half - metallic _ property ( the name coined by de groot and collaborators @xcite ) makes the one spin channel conducting , while the other is insulating ( or semiconducting ) , so that , in the ideal case , half - metals can conduct a current which is 100% spin polarized .",
    "the spin polarization @xmath1 at @xmath2 is expressed in terms of the spin - up and spin - down density of states , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as @xmath5 for an ideal half - metallic ferromagnet , @xmath6 ; however , a number of factors can reduce @xmath1 to lower values : defects and disorder , spin - orbit coupling , temperature , interface and surface states in the gap , etc . apart from a polarization value as close as possible to unity ,",
    "half - metals must have also other properties in order to be functional : a high curie point @xmath7 and compatibility with semiconductors are among the key points for spintronics applications .    in 2000 , akinaga and collaborators @xcite reported growth of a few layers of cras in the metastable zinc - blende phase ( zb ) for the first time ; this was achieved by molecular beam epitaxy on a gaas substrate ( the ground state structure of cras is the mnp structure  @xcite ) . in the zb phase , cras was reported to be ferromagnetic , with a curie point higher than 400  k. in the same publication , first - principles calculations of bulk zinc - blende cras showed the material to be a half - metallic ferromagnet ; the moment per formula unit was calculated to be 3  @xmath8 , in agreement with the experimental result .",
    "these findings initiated a strong activity , because several merits were combined : the half - metallic property , coherent growth on a semiconductor , and @xmath7 higher than room temperature .",
    "the activity was extended beyond zb cras , encompassing a variety of tetrahedrally bonded transition metal ( tm ) compounds with @xmath9 atoms of the iv , v and vi groups of the periodic table . in this paper",
    "we review relevant investigations up to date , with emphasis on the theoretical results on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of these compounds .",
    "we do not extend our review to the related but vast topics of diluted magnetic semiconductors or other types of half - metals .",
    "we also note in passing the surprising ( calculated ) appearance of half - metallic ferromagnetism in tetrahedrally bonded compounds of i - v and ii - v elements  @xcite , such as zb caas , where no transition metals are involved .",
    "the origin of ferromagnetism is therefore of a different nature here , but a discussion of these compounds is beyond the purpose of the present work .    the remainder of the paper is summarized as follows .",
    "we begin with a summary of experimental findings in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] is devoted to an analysis of the electronic and magnetic structure of half - metallic zinc - blende compounds , as obtained by first - principles calculations .",
    "investigations on the magnetic ground state ( ferromagnetic vs. antiferromagnetic ) , exchange interactions and curie temperatures of such compounds are reviewed in section [ sec : ferro ] .",
    "the metastability of the zinc - blende phase , compared to the nias or other phases , is addressed in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "the possibility of surface half - metallicity is discussed in section [ sec:4 ] . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we review the properties of the interfaces with semiconductors , including delta - doping and transport in multilayered structures .",
    "we continue with a discussion on the effect of disorder on the half - metallic gap in section [ sec:7 ] . section [ sec:8 ] is devoted to tetrahedrally bonded tm-@xmath9 compounds with other structures , such as the wurtzite structure",
    ". finally , in section [ sec:12 ] review results of calculations beyond density - functional theory .",
    "we conclude with a summary in section  [ sec:13 ] .",
    "experimentally , cras in the zinc - blende structure was first grown by akinaga _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on a gaas substrate .",
    "the zb phase could be stabilized only for thin cras layers ; for samples above a critical thickness of 3  nm , the reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) pattern indicated an unknown different phase ; such small thicknesses are typical in all experiments involving zb pnictides ( compounds including group - v atoms ) or chalcogenides ( compounds including group - vi atoms ) .",
    "the measured saturation magnetization at low temperature corresponded to 3  @xmath10  per formula unit , in good agreement with _",
    "ab - initio _ calculations ( which also predicted a half - metallic band structure ) . the precise curie temperature was not reported , but it was found to be higher than 400  k , suggesting applicability at room temperature .",
    "the surface morphology and magnetic characteristics of zb cras films under different growth conditions were studied in reference  @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , a thickness - dependence angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) study showed a dispersion for a 2  nm cras film , which was not present for a 30  nm film ; this , together with the rheed pattern , suggested a monocrystalline sample at 2  nm , changing to polycrystalline at 30  nm .",
    "arpes data on a thin zb - cras film were also presented in reference  @xcite .",
    "further work  @xcite , based on fluorescence extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) , provided more evidence on the existence of zb phase on a 2  nm zb cras film , and found a cras bond length of 2.49    ( in close agreement with the value of 2.52    which is deduced from _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , high - resolution transmission electron micrography ( hrtem ) and x - ray grazing incidence diffraction ( gid ) were used in reference  @xcite to identify 2.5  nm ( @xmath11 monolayers ( ml ) ) thick zb cras on gaas ; it was found that the zb - phase can be partly deformed by appropriate annealing .",
    "the samples were ferromagnetic , the saturation magnetic moment of both phases was found to be about 3  @xmath10  per formula unit , and @xmath7 was above 400  k.    in parallel , zb cras / gaas multilayers were grown by use of mbe and studied in references  @xcite and @xcite . in both studies the optimal ( for the zb - structure ) multilayers consisted of a period of 2  ml of gaas and 2  ml of cras .",
    "the period was repeated 20 times in @xcite and 100 times in @xcite .",
    "magnetization measurements in @xcite showed a magnetic moment of 2  @xmath10  per formula unit of cras ( lower than the theoretical prediction of 3  @xmath10 ) , and a curie temperature of 800  k.    crsb was also grown by mbe in ultrathin films of a few monolayers in the zinc - blende structure  @xcite . in the work of reference",
    "@xcite , a gaas , gasb , and ( al , ga)sb substrates were used .",
    "the structure was examined by hrtem and rheed .",
    "the samples were ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment per formula unit reported to be between 3 and 5  @xmath10  ( the theoretical prediction is 3  @xmath10  @xcite ) and a @xmath7 definitely exceeding 400  k. in reference  @xcite it was shown how the substrate can be tailored for growth of somewhat thicker films of crsb . while the maximal thickness on gaas was found to be 1  nm ( 3  ml ) , an ( in , ga)as substrate provides a larger lattice parameter which can be tuned by changing the in composition to favor the growth of zb - crsb . on an in@xmath12ga@xmath13as substrate ,",
    "6  ml of zb - crsb were successfully grown , and for an in@xmath14ga@xmath15as substrate , growth of a 9  ml ( 3  nm ) zb - crsb film could be achieved .    also crsb / gaas multilayers in the zb structure were grown  @xcite . here , the crsb thickness was just 1  ml , while the gaas layers were 5  nm thick , and the multilayers included up to four periods .",
    "the zb - structure was monitored by rheed measurements during growth , and cross - checked for dislocations at the interfaces by hrtem .",
    "the saturation magnetization at low temperatures was close to the theoretical value of 3  @xmath10 .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition temperature was reported to be above 400  k ( measurements at high temperatures were limited by the superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) ) .",
    "mnas could be grown in nanodots in the zinc - blende structure  @xcite .",
    "references  @xcite and @xcite report growth of zb - mnas dots of average size of about 16  nm on sulphur - terminated gaas(001 ) surfaces , with a density of dots of @xmath16/@xmath17 . when the growth was continued , the mnas dots changed to the nias structure ( which is the equilibrium structure of mnas ) .",
    "squid measurements showed the zb - mnas dots to be ferromagnetic , with a curie temperature of about 280  k. photoemission spectra  @xcite show a localization of the mn @xmath18 states , with absence of a fermi edge , a main peak at around @xmath19  ev below @xmath0 , and a satellite at @xmath20  ev below @xmath0 ; these features are similar to ( ga , mn)as diluted magnetic semiconductors , and quite different than mnas in the nias structure , where a fermi edge is clearly seen in photoemission  @xcite .",
    "similar are the conclusions of reference  @xcite , where it is reported that , with increasing dot density ( above @xmath21/@xmath17 ) , a fermi edge evolves in the photoemission spectrum .",
    "this onset of metallic behaviour is attributed by the authors either to formation of a nias - type of structure or to percolation among the clusters .",
    "we also note the possibility of delta - doped gaas with mn @xcite ; see section [ sec : delta ] for further discussion .",
    "further experimental work on zinc - blende pnictides and chalcogenides includes mbe growth of gasb(25 )/mnsb(2  ) ( 001 ) multilayers  @xcite and crte on gaas(001 ) thin films  @xcite . in both cases",
    "it is reported that there are strong indications of a zb phase , but no definite proof .",
    "finally , we note that , to our knowledge , the half - metallic property itself has not been experimentally proven or disproven in these compounds .",

    "down : calculated spin - resolved band structure and spin- and atom - resolved density of states of zinc - blende cras in the gaas lattice parameter within the lsda .",
    "[ fig:1],title=\"fig : \" ]    the principal mechanism leading to the appearance of the half - metallic gap in zinc - blende compounds of transition metals ( tm ) with @xmath9 elements is the hybridization of the @xmath18 wavefunctions of the tm with the @xmath22 wavefunctions of the @xmath9 atom . this _",
    "@xmath22-@xmath18 hybridization _ is dictated by the tetrahedral environment , where each atom is surrounded by four atoms of the other species .",
    "in particular , in the presence of tetrahedral symmetry the @xmath18-states split in two irreducible subspaces : the threefold - degenerate @xmath23  subspace , consisting of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 states , and the twofold - degenerate @xmath27  subspace , which includes the @xmath28 and @xmath29 states .",
    "only states of the former subspace can hybridize with the @xmath22 states of the @xmath9-atom neighbours , forming bonding and antibonding hybrids ; the @xmath27  states , on the contrary , remain rather non - bonding .",
    "the situation is shown schematically in figure [ fig:1 ] ( up ) for both spins , with the majority ( spin - up ) @xmath18 states being lower in energy than the spin - down states due to the exchange splitting .",
    "starting from this picture , we can proceed now to a discussion of the energy bands , shown in figure [ fig:1 ] ( down ) , and calculated within the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) of density - functional theory ( the as @xmath30 states are much lower in energy and omitted in the figure ) .",
    "we note that the notations @xmath27  and @xmath23are , strictly speaking , valid only for states at the center of the brillouin zone ; however , the energy bands formed by the @xmath27  and @xmath23states are energetically rather separated , therefore we keep this notation for the bands formed by these states .",
    "the strong @xmath22-@xmath18 hybridization leads to wide corresponding @xmath23  energy bands , located , for spin up , at about @xmath31 to @xmath32 ev ( bonding states ) , and above @xmath0(antibonding ) ; the latter are in the same energy range with the cr @xmath33 states .",
    "the rather non - bonding @xmath27  states , on the contrary , form mainly narrow bands . these remain energetically between the bonding and antibonding @xmath22-@xmath18 bands , at about @xmath34 ev . for spin down , the situation is similar , with all bands shifted to higher energies because of the exchange splitting ; the spin - down bands are also wider , because they reside at higher energies .",
    "the striking effect is that , for spin - down , the exchange splitting is strong enough to push the @xmath27  states just above the fermi level , so that @xmath0  is in the gap .",
    "this is also seen in the atom- and spin - resolved density of states ( dos ) . according to the calculated dos ,",
    "the material is manifestly half - metallic in its electronic and magnetic ground state .",
    "this basic form of the electronic density of states is found by all relevant electronic structure calculations , within either the lsda or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to density - functional theory .",
    "calculations within the gga show a slightly stronger local magnetic moment at the cr site , resulting in a stronger exchange splitting and a wider gap ; then , @xmath0  is even deeper within the gap .",
    "it is generally expected that the gga yields a more accurate prediction of the lattice parameter and magnetic moment in magnetic compounds , with corrections of the order of 2 - 3% .",
    "the @xmath22-@xmath18 hybridization , essential to the formation of the gap , is well - known as _ p - d repulsion _ in the physics of tm defects in semiconductors of zinc - blende ( where the tm substitutes the cation ) or diamond structure  @xcite , and is essentially present also in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) @xcite . in this respect",
    ", the electronic structure of zinc - blende pnictides and chalcogenides can be viewed as the electronic structure of tm - doped semiconductors in the limit of high concentration . from the electronic structure point of view",
    ", it is expected that all zinc - blende binary compounds of tm with group iv , v , and vi @xmath9-atoms are candidates for the appearance of half - metallic ferromagnetism  in fact , their calculated density of states is similar to the one of cras  ( e.g. see references @xcite ) , with spin - down gaps around 0.51  ev when the @xmath9 element belongs to the iv - group , around 12  ev when it belongs to the v - group , and 1.52.5  ev when it belongs to the vi - group , and with the spin - up bands appropriately shifted to achieve charge neutrality .",
    "the half - metallic state is , however , not guaranteed in all of these compounds , nor is a ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "we discuss this in sections [ sec : ferro ] and [ sec:6 ] .",
    "as we shall see , other factors ( lattice constant , antiferromagnetic interactions , structural instabilities , etc . ) limit this expectation , but a number of compounds remains within these limits .      in the bulk of half - metallic compounds ,",
    "the spin moment per formula unit is an integer ( in @xmath10 ) .",
    "since @xmath0  is in the gap , the total number of spin - down valence electrons per formula unit , @xmath35 , is an integer . the total number of valence electrons per formula unit , @xmath36 , must also be an integer , so it follows that the number of valence spin - up electrons , @xmath37 , is an integer .",
    "thus the magnetic moment , @xmath38 , is an integer .",
    "this is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for half - metallicity .",
    "( at surfaces or interfaces this can change ; see sections  [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ] . )    due to the similarity in the dos of all zinc - blende pnictides and chalcogenides , the number of spin down valence states up to the gap is always four : there is the low - lying @xmath33 band of the @xmath9 atom , and the three bonding @xmath22-@xmath18 ( @xmath23 ) bands .",
    "therefore , assuming half - metallic behaviour , the total moment per formula unit follows a slater - pauling - like `` rule of 8 '' : @xmath39 analogous relations hold for the half - metallic heusler alloys , where there is a slater - pauling rule of 18 ( in half - heusler alloys ) and rule of 24 ( in full - heusler alloys ) @xcite .",
    "thus , in the half - metallic state , cras and crsb have a moment of 3  @xmath10 , while crse or mnas ( having one more valence electron ) show a moment of 4  @xmath10 .",
    "once more an analogy to the diluted magnetic semiconductors can be seen : calculations show that , for instance in ga@xmath40mn@xmath41as , the spin moment per mn atom is exactly 4  @xmath10 .",
    "note that also ternary compounds , such as ( cr , mn)as , follow the same rules , as long as all tm ( here cr and mn ) occupy the same sublattice of the zinc - blende structure ; for instance , see reference  @xcite for calculations on half - metallic cras / mnas(001 ) superlattices .    from an alternative viewpoint",
    ", we can say that the @xmath22 states , low - lying as they are in energy , act as reservoirs , hosting electrons which are donated by the tm until the @xmath22 states are filled up with 6 electrons .",
    "the remaining tm @xmath18 electrons build up the spin moment .",
    "this viewpoint neglects the essential @xmath22-@xmath18 hybridization , but is useful for electron counting .",
    "similar to the pnictides and chalcogenides is the electronic structure of zb tm - compounds with si , ge , and sn @xcite .",
    "however , zb tm - compounds with c ( e.g. mnc ) have a distinctly different density of states , with the half - metallic gap being among the spin - up states , while the spin - down bands are metallic @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to a `` rule of 12 '' instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , and originates from the huge gap induced by carbon @xcite .      in terms of the @xmath22-@xmath18 hybridization",
    "one can understand the dos and local magnetic moment trends with changing cation valence and/or electronegativity .",
    "firstly we note that the @xmath9 atom has a moment oppositely oriented to the one of the tm ; calculated values are shown in table  [ table:1 ] ( up ) . to understand this",
    ", we observe that the spin - up @xmath18 states of the tm are lower in energy than the spin - down @xmath18 states ; thus , when the @xmath22-@xmath18 hybridization occurs , the bonding spin - up @xmath23  hybrids have a larger @xmath18 admixture and are more itinerant than the spin - down ones ; the latter are more localized within the @xmath9 atom .",
    "thus , in the wigner - seitz cell of the @xmath9 atom , the spin - down states are in the majority , leading to this `` antiferromagnetic '' coupling .    according to this picture ,",
    "the following trends can be deduced under unchanged lattice parameter .",
    "on changing the @xmath9 atom for a lighter one of the same group ( therefore more electronegative ) , the @xmath22 states are shifted to lower energies and the spin - down @xmath22-@xmath18 hybridization is reduced ; the spin - down bonding @xmath22-@xmath18 bands become more localized at the @xmath9 atom , transferring to its vicinity spin - down charge from the tm . on the other hand , because of the proximity of the spin - up @xmath18 states , the spin - up hybridization is reduced to a lesser extent ( this can be seen by a tight - binding argument , as the hopping decreases with the energy separation ) . as a result , the local moment of the @xmath9 atom increases ; the same is true for the local moment of the tm , since the sum , @xmath42 , must be constant integer . also the gap increases for lighter @xmath9 atoms , because the @xmath22 states ( forming the valence band ) are shifted lower , and the @xmath27  states ( forming the conduction band ) are shifted higher by the stronger local tm moment and exchange splitting , where @xmath43 is the magnetic moment and @xmath44 is the exchange integral , having a value of about 0.9  @xmath10/ev for transition metals . ] .",
    "note also that tm - group  vi compounds show a wider gap than tm - group  v compounds , because the @xmath22 states of the former are lower in energy .",
    "competing with these effects is the strong reduction in lattice parameter due to the smaller volume of lighter @xmath9 elements .",
    "this results in reduction of the local moments ( due to stronger hybridization ) , and also loss of half - metallicity ( as we discuss below ) ; in table  [ table:1 ] ( down ) we show the effect of lattice compression on the local moments of cras .",
    "as it turns out , the effects of the change of lattice parameter by far outweigh the effects of electronegativity .",
    ".up : local moments ( in @xmath10 ) of the tm and @xmath9 atoms in zinc - blende pnictides and chalcogenides calculated within the lsda in the ( large ) inas lattice parameter ( after reference  @xcite ) , showing trends due to electronegativity of the anion .",
    "down : effect of changing the lattice parameter on the local magnetic moments of cras .",
    "the magnetization of the interstitial region ( amounting to about half of the volume in the zb structure ) is small and not included in the table.[table:1 ] [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      spin - orbit coupling introduces a mixing of the two spin channels , so that the electron spin is not a good quantum number .",
    "therefore , it is presence , it is expected that states which were previously accounted as spin - up states in the region of the half - metallic gap , will now have some contribution to the spin - down dos ; strictly speaking , the half - metallic property ( @xmath45 ) can never be achieved , since some amount of spin - orbit coupling is present in all materials .",
    "then , the half - metallic gap turns into a pseudo - gap , with some spectral intensity .",
    "however , first - principles calculations @xcite show that the effect can be small , of the order of 1% , except in the case when heavy elements are present .",
    "thus , when spin - orbit coupling is included in the calculations , cras shows a polarization of @xmath46 , crsb shows @xmath47 ( note that sb is heavier than as ) , and mnbi shows a much reduced polarization of @xmath48 ( neglecting spin - orbit coupling , mnbi is predicted  @xcite to be half - metallic ) .",
    "these results demonstrate that spin - orbit coupling is significant for a heavy element such as bi , also because of its @xmath49 states which are directly involved in the band structure around @xmath0 .",
    "the calculated orbital moment of mnbi is large , too , reaching a value of 0.11  @xmath10 .",
    "a theoretical analysis based on perturbation theory @xcite shows that the spectral properties in the half - metallic spin - down pseudo - gap depend ( i ) on the spin - up dos in the same region and ( ii ) on the proximity of the energy to the band edges .",
    "it is deduced ( and verified by _ ab - initio _ calculations ) that ( i ) the spin - down dos is a weak reflection of the spin - up dos , depending quadratically on the spin - orbit coupling spin - flip strength , @xmath50 ; and ( ii ) that , close to the band edges , @xmath51 increases strongly , so that it must be treated beyond first order in perturbation theory ( because of the degeneracy of unperturbed spin - up and spin - down eigenvalues at the band edge ) .",
    "in the discussion up to now we assumed a ferromagnetic ground state , and experiment has shown that cras , crsb , and mnas in the zinc - blende phase are ferromagnetic ( see section [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "however , the ferromagnetic ground state has to be attested by calculations for the not - yet - fabricated compounds . in a number of papers @xcite this aspect",
    "is examined via first - principles calculations . in the framework of such calculations",
    "there are three ways to attest the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "( i ) non - collinear magnetic calculations can be made , where the system is allowed to relax in any arbitrary non - collinear configuration .",
    "( ii ) total energy calculations can be made in the ferromagnetic and in several antiferromagnetic states ( perhaps including disordered local moment states within the coherent potential approximation ) , seeking the energy minimum .",
    "( iii ) starting from a ferromagnetic state , the interatomic exchange constants can be calculated ( usually assuming interactions within a heisenberg model ) , from which conclusions can be drawn as regards the ground state , as well as excited state properties , including the curie temperature ( see section [ sec : exc ] ) .",
    "these methods are to a great extent complementary , and their applicability depends on the size of the system as well as the computational method used .",
    "the most accurate way of calculation is probably ( i ) , but it is often not practical because it requires use of large supercells , solution of equations coupling the two spin channels , and must be applied to many starting configurations , especially if there are more than one local energy minima .",
    "thus , ( ii ) and ( iii ) are most common in practice , and can in most cases ascertain if the ground state is indeed ferromagnetic or not .",
    "we note , however , that if the magnetic ground state is not ferromagnetic , it is likely to be non - collinear , since the fcc geometry ( corresponding to the tm sublattice ) causes magnetic frustration in the case of antiferromagnetic exchange interactions .    as a general principle ( but with notable exceptions , depending mainly on the lattice parameter ) , the magnetic ground state of tm pnictides and chalcogenides in the zinc - blende structure is ferromagnetic , if the total number of valence electrons @xmath52 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] , this means that the maximum moment in the half - metallic state is 4  @xmath10 .",
    "thus , for instance , mnas is expected to be ferromagnetic , but mnse or feas are expected to be antiferromagnetic ( or non - collinear ) .",
    "the reasoning behind this rule is the following .",
    "ferromagnetic order in these compounds is brought about by the double exchange mechanism ( energy is gained by a band - broadening at @xmath0  due to hybridizations ) involving the spin - up antibonding @xmath23  states .",
    "once @xmath36 exceeds 12 , the spin - up @xmath23  states are fully occupied , and the double exchange mechanism is no more present ( the band broadening does not bring any gain in energy ) ; thus the ferromagnetic order is lost.-@xmath18 exchange . ]      in accordance with the above , total energy calculations  @xcite have shown that vas , cras and mnas are ferromagnetic , while feas was found to have an antiferromagnetic ground state ( the possibility of a non - collinear state was not examined in  @xcite ) .",
    "the energy gain for the formation of the ferromagnetic state ( compared to the antiferromagnetic ) is about 0.2  ev for vas , 0.3  ev for cras , and 0.1  ev for mnas ; the antiferromagnetic state of feas provides an energy gain of 0.1  ev compared to the ferromagnetic state ( all energies calculated within the lsda )  @xcite .",
    "calculations on mnte in the zinc - blende structure have shown that it also has an antiferromagnetic ground state  @xcite .",
    "other calculations have confirmed this aspect .",
    "total energy calculations have confirmed a ferromagnetic ground state for mnas  @xcite , cras  @xcite and crsb  @xcite .",
    "a recent study  @xcite on mnas concludes that , as @xmath0  enters the spin - down conduction band , there occurs a fermi surface nesting ( i.e. , a large area of the spin - down fermi surface is almost parallel to the spin - up fermi surface , being separated by an almost constant vector @xmath53 ) , allowing for virtual spin - flip excitations of wavevector @xmath53 and leading to a corresponding non - collinear state . from another viewpoint ,",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that there are two factors determining the first - neighbour mn - mn interaction in mnas : a direct mn(@xmath18)-mn(@xmath18 ) , antiferromagnetic interaction and an indirect ferromagnetic mn(@xmath18)-as(@xmath22)-mn(@xmath18 ) interaction .",
    "the former is dominant at close mn - mn distances , inducing an antiferromagnetic state , but as the lattice parameter increases the overlap of the @xmath18 states of neighbouring mn atoms is lost , so that the indirect , ferromagnetic interaction dominates .",
    "this fragility of ferromagnetism in mnas is in accordance to the results of exchange interaction studies ( section [ sec : exc ] ) .",
    "sakuma  @xcite reports a systematic investigation of the interatomic exchange interactions in cras , mnsi , mnge , and mnsn in the zinc - blende structure . under the assumption of the validity of a heisenberg model , with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the magnetic moment direction at site @xmath56 )",
    ", the exchange constants @xmath57 are found via the liechtenstein formula  @xcite . in this formula ,",
    "the _ ab - initio _ band structure properties enter , so that the exchange constants are calculated without any adjustable parameter .",
    "the coefficient @xmath58 , corresponding to the band - energy cost for flipping the magnetic moment of a single atom , reflects a `` single - site spin stiffness '' , and the ferromagnetic state is stable when @xmath59 ; a rotation of the local moment by a small angle @xmath60 costs energy @xmath61 , while the mean - field curie temperature is @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "this method is not as accurate as a full self - consistent calculation of a magnetic moment flip , but it is much faster and efficient in showing trends .    all studied compounds in  @xcite were found to be ferromagnetic for a wide range of lattice parameters ; @xmath64 increases as a function of lattice parameter , as @xmath0  enters deeper into the half - metallic gap .",
    "furthermore , by treating @xmath0  as a parameter for a fixed band structure ( and calculating @xmath65 ) , the relative contribution to the coupling at each energy was found as a function of band - filling .",
    "it was shown that the spin - up antibonding @xmath23  states contribute to the ferromagnetic stability , while the spin - down conduction band states ( @xmath27  and antibonding @xmath23 ) induce an antiferromagnetic coupling and cause a change of sign to @xmath64 as @xmath0enters the conduction band .",
    "the highest values for @xmath64 are found for @xmath0  in the middle of the gap .",
    "the local - moment - flip energy cost in cras , in the gaas lattice constant ( and at the real @xmath0 ) , was found to be about 0.3  ev , which compares well with the ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic energy difference of 0.3  ev calculated by shirai  @xcite .",
    "interatomic exchange interactions were also studied in @xcite for v , cr , and mn compounds with as , sb , and p. it was found that the strongest tendency for ferromagnetism is among the cr - based compounds , a result verified in  @xcite for pnictides . in cras , the first - neighbour cr - cr exchange constant @xmath66 is dominant , of the order of 15  mev .",
    "the second - neighbor cr - cr interaction @xmath67 is negative ( antiferromagnetic ) and an order of magnitude smaller ( about @xmath68  mev ) ; due to the half - metallic gap , the exchange constants fall off rapidly with distance .    in reference",
    "@xcite , the stability of ferromagnetism in zinc - blende cras , crse , mnas , mnc , mnsi , and mnge was studied , again based on the calculation of exchange constants . similarly to reference  @xcite ,",
    "lattice compression was found to destabilize the ferromagnetic state , as @xmath0  approaches and enters the spin - down conduction band .",
    "the effect was found to be quite drastic in mnas , with the ferromagnetic mn - mn interaction @xmath66 decreasing in magnitude , and the antiferromagnetic mn - mn interaction @xmath67 increasing in magnitude ; this effect was even stronger in crse .",
    "( in the other compounds , the trends are similar , but not as drastic . )",
    "thus , as the mnas lattice parameter is reduced from 5.87    to 5.68    ( a change of only about 3.5% ) , the curie temperature ( calculated within the random phase approximation ) @xmath69 drops from 551  k to 136  k ; and crse , for a similar compression , is found to change phase from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic ( @xmath69 becomes negative ) .",
    "the trend of the mean - field result , @xmath70 , is similar .",
    "an inspection of the density of states leads to the conclusion that the antiferromagnetic susceptibility becomes dominant as @xmath0  enters the spin - down conduction band due to compression ; this conclusion is in agreement with the result of sakuma  @xcite , as well as with the results reported by kbler  @xcite and by sanyal et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "curie temperatures were calculated in references  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . to this purpose ,",
    "several methods have been employed . for the solution of the heisenberg model ( after calculation of the exchange constants by brillouin - zone integration of static - spin - spiral energies ) , there have been used the monte - carlo method  @xcite ( which are the most accurate ) , the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) @xcite ( overestimating @xmath7 ) , or the random - phase approximation  @xcite ( rpa ) ( more accurate than the mfa ) .",
    "alternatively , the approach in @xcite identifies the non - local dynamic susceptibility including an adjusted damping parameter . due to the different approaches in the various works , and without experimental results on @xmath7 in bulk systems , a direct comparison of the result for @xmath7 is meaningless , however a comparison of @xmath7-trends calculated within the same method is definitely meaningful .",
    "it is a common conclusion that the ferromagnetic state is most robust in cras , which shows the highest calculated value of @xmath7 ( ranging between 790  k and about 1200  k , depending on the method ) .",
    "the bottleneck for the fabrication of chalcogenides and pnictides in the zinc - blende structure seems to be their structural instability .",
    "the ground state structure of these compounds is in many cases the hexagonal nias structure ( mnp structure for cras ) , in which they are not half - metallic .",
    "the zinc - blende phase is metastable , and needs therefore to be stabilized via pseudomorphic growth on a semiconductor substrate of the zinc - blende or diamond structure .",
    "total energy calculations @xcite have confirmed that the nias structure has considerably lower energy than the zb structure for almost all tm pnictides and chalcogenides , with the exception of nitrides @xcite which are reported to have a rock - salt ground state ( for the early transition metal compounds scn - crn ) or a zinc - blende ground state ( for the late transition metal compounds , mnn - con ) ; the nitrides , however , have too small a lattice parameter to be half metallic , and are beyond the scope of our discussion .",
    "the bulk zinc - blende phase has typically a higher energy of the order of @xmath711  ev per formula unit than the nias phase ( when both are calculated at their corresponding equilibrium lattice constants ) ; the nias phase has also a considerably smaller equilibrium unit cell volume @xmath72 ( e.g. , reference  @xcite reports for mnas in the nias structure @xmath73  @xmath74 and @xmath75  @xmath74 in the zinc - blende structure ) .",
    "it has been reported @xcite that @xmath76 is lower for chalcogenides ( crte , crse , and vte were considered , with @xmath770.3 to 0.5 ev ) than for pnictides ( @xmath770.5 to 1.0 ev ) , possibly giving an advantage to the growth of chalcogenides in the zinc - blende phase .    typically , under sufficient volume expansion , the nias phase becomes unfavourable compared to the zinc - blende phase ( the energy curves cross , and @xmath76 becomes negative at some increased lattice constant ) .",
    "however , more important than @xmath76 is the epitaxial energy difference @xmath78 ( i.e. , the energy difference between the two phases at a particular lattice constant when also a change of the c / a ratio is allowed ) , since a compound growing epitaxially on a substrate of increased lattice parameter will be able to adjust its c / a ratio in favour of elastic energy .",
    "this was pointed out in reference  @xcite , where a number of compounds were studied in this aspect ( mnas , cras , crsb , crs , crse , and crte ) .",
    "it was found that @xmath78 always favours the nias phase ( for all hypothetical substrate lattice parameters ) , except for crse , for which @xmath78 becomes negative at approximately 6.2   , favouring an epitaxial growth in the zinc - blende phase for substrates of higher lattice constant .",
    "nevertheless , these conclusions are valid for the growth of thick layers , while a few monolayers will be much affected by the interfacial energy .",
    "this agrees with the experimental observation that cras and crsb can be grown in the zinc - blende phase for thicknesses up to a few monolayers , and then break up .",
    "the stability of the zinc - blende phase has also been examined with respect to tetragonal and rhombohedral deformation  @xcite ( starting from the equilibrium volume in the zinc - blende structure ) .",
    "it was found that , under rhombohedral deformation , chalcogenides are stable  @xcite , while , among the studied pnictides , only cras , crsb , and mnas are stable ( although rather soft , with shear moduli of the order of 3 - 5  gpa )  @xcite .",
    "tetragonal deformation was found to be favourable for mnsb and mnbi @xcite , with an equilibrium c / a@xmath79 , but the half - metallic character was not changed .",
    "this stability of the half - metallic character under tetragonal distortion in many tm pnictides and chalcogenides is the conclusion of a number of works  @xcite . in particular",
    ", a tetragonalization along the [ 001 ] direction ( expected in the presence of a ( 001 ) interface ) distinguishes the @xmath80 axis and causes a splitting of the @xmath23  and @xmath27  irreducible representations at the brillouin zone center @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23threefold degeneracy splits into a twofold degeneracy ( involving the @xmath26-@xmath82 and @xmath25-@xmath83 hybrids ) and a non - degenerate level ( involving the @xmath24-@xmath84 hybrids ) ; the @xmath27  twofold degeneracy splits into two non - degenerate levels , one involving the @xmath29 levels and one involving the @xmath28 levels .",
    "these splittings affect the spectral function at @xmath81 , but they are in no way important for the overall dos and the gap .",
    "however , in reference  @xcite it is reported that a number of compounds ( including crse and mnas ) can not be half - metallic even at large the substrate lattice constants , because of the unfavourable vertical relaxation and c / a ratio .",
    "an interesting conclusion of the same work is that , for some pnictides ( including cras , mnas , and mnsb ) the zinc - blende phase is unstable with respect to a `` gliding '' tetragonal deformation , where the in - plane lattice parameter changes with simultaneous change of the c / a ( so that the bond length is kept constant ) . in practice , however , a tetragonal deformation of this particular kind can not take place , because the in - plane lattice parameter is fixed by the substrate .",
    "the surfaces of half - metallic ferromagnets are not guaranteed to be also half - metallic .",
    "this is because wavefunction hybridizations and bonding - antibonding splittings , essential to the appearance of the gap , change significantly at the surface ; the `` missing neighbours '' can result in the appearance of surface states in the gap , destroying half - metallicity .",
    "this is , for instance , the case in most surfaces of half - metallic heusler alloys @xcite .",
    "although half - metallic surfaces are not of particular technological interest ( contrary to half - metallic interfaces ) , they are of value for proving the half - metallic property by spin - polarized photoemission experiments , which are surface sensitive . in zinc - blende pnictides and chalcogenides , it was demonstrated by _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite that the ( 001 ) surfaces can , conditionally , be half - metallic .",
    "surface half - metallicity in the ( 001 ) surfaces of these compounds can occur only if they are terminated with the tm . in case of termination with the @xmath9 atom ,",
    "dangling bonds appear within the half - metallic gap , destroying half - metallicity ( the possibility of surface reconstruction was , however , not considered in the calculations in  @xcite ) .",
    "similar effects were found in reference  @xcite .    in case of tm termination , the electronic structure and dos changes at the surface ( even if it is half - metallic ) . a simple electron counting shows that , due to the missing @xmath9 neighbour , @xmath85 additional electrons must be accommodated by the surface tm , where @xmath86 is the valency of the @xmath9 atom . to understand this , consider that , in the bulk , these electrons would occupy bonding @xmath22-@xmath18 hybrids ; here , half of these hybrids are missing .",
    "local charge neutrality requires that these electrons remain in the vicinity of the surface ( mostly in the surface layer ) .",
    "moreover , half - metallicity is only preserved if they occupy spin - up states ( otherwise @xmath0  will enter the conduction band ) .",
    "therefore , in the cases when half - metallicity is preserved , the spin moment at the surface increases by @xmath85  @xmath10  per surface atom .",
    "this also leads to an increase of the exchange splitting , shifting the spin - down @xmath27levels higher in energy , thus also increasing the gap width .",
    "such is the calculated case in , e.g. , cras , vas , or crse . on the other hand",
    ", mnas has a bulk moment of 4  @xmath10  per formula unit .",
    "if its mn - terminated , ( 001 ) surface were to retain the half - metallic character , the local moment should increase to 5.5  @xmath10 .",
    "this , however , is not possible , since the spin - up @xmath27  and antibonding @xmath23states can accommodate at most 5 electrons , leading to a maximum moment of 5  @xmath10 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath27  spin - down states are occupied , and half - metallicity is lost .",
    "also the ( 110 ) surfaces of crp and cras were found to be half - metallic in reference  @xcite ( the calculation of crp  @xcite was done at an expanded lattice constant ( 5.48 ) , at which also bulk half - metallicity appears ) .",
    "interestingly , the ( 110 ) surface contains both kinds of atoms ( cr and p or cr and as ) , and no dangling bonds appear to destroy the half - metallic property .",
    "since , from the electronic structure point of view , all ferromagnetic zinc - blende pnictides and chalcogenides are similar , it is expected that surface half - metallicity is likely to appear in such compounds",
    ". however , more theoretical investigations are necessary to verify this , examining in particular the effect of lattice relaxations and surface reconstruction .",
    "for technological applications of half - metals , especially in magnetic tunnel junctions , it is imperative to eliminate the interface states in the gap region ( i.e. , for spin down ) of the half - metal - semiconductor interface .",
    "the reason is that these states can act as carrier reservoirs and contribute to the transport , although they are localized , because the tunneling rate can be much lower than the refill rate of these states by spin - orbit coupling or inelastic effects  @xcite .",
    "contacts of half - metallic heusler alloys with semiconductors are known to host such interface states in almost all studied cases @xcite .",
    "it is therefore gratifying that pnictides and chalcogenides in the zinc - blende structure retain their half - metallicity also at the interfaces with semiconductors ( which are anyhow the natural substrate for growth of these half - metals ) .",
    "the reason is that the bonding character changes coherently at the interface .",
    "for example , at a cras / gaas interface ( with an as interface layer ) , the @xmath22 states of the as interface atoms hybridize with the cr @xmath18-states on the one side and with the ga @xmath33 states on the other .",
    "thus , the bonding - antibonding splitting does not cease at the interface .",
    "such a behaviour is expected also in view of half - metallicity in tm - doped diluted magnetic semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "interfaces of half - metallic pnictides and chalcogenides in the zinc - blende structure with iii - v and ii - vi semiconductors ( in the same structure ) were studied theoretically in @xcite . it was found that no interface states appear at @xmath0  within the half - metallic gap , because of the coherent bonding described above .",
    "moreover , moderate tetragonalization ( which is expected in the case of a slight lattice mismatch ) was not found to alter the half - metallic character .",
    "( see section [ sec:6 ] for a discussion of tetragonalization ) .",
    "the half - metallic gap was found to be persistent also in the case of a 50% itermixing at the interfaces @xcite , in the sence that , at cras / gaas for instance , the interface layer is half occupied by ga and half by cr .",
    "this is expected , since , again , the bonding continues coherently , and it is known that half - metallicity is present for a wide range of concentrations in diluted magnetic semiconductors  @xcite .    the gap remains present at the interface also in the case that the semiconductor and half - metal anions are different ( e.g. , cras / gasb ) . if , however , the valency of the cation changes , the electronic structure is more complicated @xcite . as an example we take a crsb / znte(001 ) interface , where znte is a ii - vi semiconductor , while sb is a group v element .",
    "interface states appear at @xmath0  in the case of direct zn - sb contact , i.e. , if the layered structure is of the form ...",
    "crsbcrsbznteznte ... on the other hand , if the interface atoms in contact are cr and te ( structure of the form ... crsbcrteznte ... ) , the gap is preserved at the interface . in the latter case",
    ", there is also a local increase of magnetic moment at the interface cr atoms from 3 to 3.5 @xmath10  because the te atoms have one less @xmath22 hole than the sb atoms , thus the interface cr spin - up charge is increased .",
    "delta - doping of semiconductors by tm constitutes a special , limiting case of half - metal - semiconductor interface @xcite .",
    "such `` digital '' compounds are of special interest , because of their two - dimensional half - metallic behaviour and the highly anisotropic transport properties  @xcite .",
    "also , delta - doping is a possible way to overcome the low solubility limit of transition metals in iii - v semiconductors , making such constructions interesting as a special case of diluted magnetic semiconductors .",
    "experiments on gaas , delta - doped with mn ( in the submonolayer range ) , found the compound to be ferromagnetic @xcite .",

    "a two - dimensional ferromagnetic , half - metallic character was also found by calculations in gaas delta - doped with mn @xcite . in reference  @xcite , the conductivity was also calculated , and it was found that the in - plane conductivity was metallic ( only for spin up ) , with the current confined at and close to the mn layers , while the perpendicular - to - the - plane conductivity was extremely low , reflecting the tunneling between the mn layers .",
    "it is known that ferromagnetic order in dms ( in particular ga@xmath40mn@xmath41as ) is assisted by the @xmath22 holes introduced by the mn dopants ( due to the @xmath22-@xmath18 repulsion )  @xcite . as mn - delta - doped gaas",
    "can be viewed as a limiting case of dms , it is interesting to see @xcite that also the @xmath22-holes are in this case confined at and close to the mn layers .",
    "calculations on a delta - doped layer of mn in si @xcite and ge @xcite also showed two - dimensional half - metallic ferromagnetism , based on the same basic mechanism .    in reference  @xcite",

    ", vas is found to be a ferromagnetic semiconductor , because @xmath0  lies exactly between the spin - up @xmath27and antibonding @xmath23  states ( for spin - down it is in the half - metallic gap ) .",
    "the spin - up gap is tiny , of the order of 50  mev . within the lsda+dmft",
    ", it is found that the spin - up @xmath27and @xmath23  states are shifted towards the fermi level , closing the gap completely and causing a transition from semiconducting to half - metallic behaviour .",
    "we would also like to point out the problem of absence of a fermi edge observed in the photoemission spectroscopy of ferromagnetic zb mnas nanodots  @xcite ( see also section  [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to theoretical results within density - functional theory , and to our knowledge its explanation is an open problem which deserves more attention in the future .",
    "an open question is the behaviour of the spin polarization @xmath1 at @xmath0at elevated temperatures @xmath112 , since it is obvious that @xmath1 must drop at high @xmath112 .",
    "only few theoretical attempts have been made in this direction  @xcite , examining different mechanisms that can contribute to the drop of @xmath113 .",
    "these depend on many factors , including the exact band structure and position of @xmath0  in the gap , but the theoretical methods have not been applied to zb pnictides and chalcogenides . in order to obtain a quantitative result",
    ", these theories have to be refined and unified ( in our opinion , this is one of the most challenging theoretical problems in the field of half - metallic ferromagnets ) ; they indicate , however , that a high @xmath1 at room temperature requires ( i ) @xmath7 to be considerably higher than room temperature and ( ii ) @xmath0  to be deep in the gap , and not in the proximity of a band edge .",
    "experimentally , @xmath113 can be approached indirectly via transport measurements in magnetic tunnel junctions under some assumptions on the polarization - dependence of the magnetoresistance  @xcite .",
    "in this review we have summarized the work reported on transition metal pnictides and chalcogenides in the zinc - blende structure .",
    "relatively few experimental results have been published .",
    "we believe that this is due to the difficulties in experimental growth of these structures .",
    "so far , experimental fabrication has been demonstrated only for ultrathin layers ( including multilayers ) of cras and crsb and nanodots of mnas , and evidence exists for ultrathin layers of mnas and crte ( see section [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "magnetic measurements have been reported , but no evidence has been shown of half - metallic behaviour ( or of its absence , except for the insulating phase reported for zb mnas nanodots @xcite ) . at the same time , there are many theoretical and computational investigations on the subject , including other related structures . to a great extent , these concern the structural stability of the zb phase ( see section  [ sec:6 ] ) , and demonstrate that this phase can at most be grown epitaxially for a few layers ( in agreement with experiments on cras and crsb ) . although no prediction on future experimental results can be made , we conclude that , if zb pnictides or chalcogenides are to be used in spintronics applications ( such as magnetic tunnel junctions or spin injection ) , it has to be done in a way that a few monolayers are sufficient .    on the other hand , from the calculated electronic structure and transport point of view ,",
    "these compounds are excellent , and growth of a few monolayers is probably enough for applications .",
    "theoretical investigations show that , at the contact with semiconductors , no interface states in the gap are present , and that the half - metallic state is also robust against tetragonal distortions .",
    "the ferromagnetic interactions are dominant even in delta - doped ( i.e. , one - monolayer ) cases , so that even one monolayer should be enough to provide fully spin - polarized transport .",
    "calculations including dynamic correlations show that the half - metallic property ( at least in cras ) is not affected , except for the non - quasiparticle states just above @xmath0 .",
    "the material with the most robust ferromagnetism is probably cras , which is found by calculations to have the highest curie temperature .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that , among the materials which were reviewed here , the best candidates for future applications are cras and crsb ( since they were the zb pnictides fabricated so - far ) , or delta - doped compounds ( including si and ge ) in the monolayer or sub - monolayer range .",
