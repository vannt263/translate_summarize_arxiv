    "the topic of domain - wall motion in magnetic nanowires has in the last years become subject to much interest @xcite .",
    "this is in large part due to the prospect of transferring and saving information via manipulation of domains that distinguish opposite directions of magnetization . finding ways to achieve such domain - wall motion with minimal energy losses due to joule heating from resistance and at the same time retain well - defined control over the dynamics is crucial with respect to possible technological applications @xcite .",
    "it is known that domain - wall motion may be induced by either injecting electric currents @xcite into nanowires or utilizing static magnetic fields @xcite . however , a second opportunity was very recently revealed : namely , moving the domain - wall structure via magnonic spin - transfer torque @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind this mechanism is that the magnon spin is flipped when passing through a domain wall indicating that spin angular momentum has been absorbed by the domain wall , thus causing it to move in the opposite direction of the spin - wave .",
    "interestingly , the properties of spin - transfer torque phenomena should be modified in the presence of spin - orbit interactions @xcite .",
    "such interactions may originate from intrinsic properties of the material at hand or the structural inversion asymmetry present at surfaces .",
    "a series of recent experiments @xcite have reported anomalous behavior of domain - wall motion due to current - bias which could possibly be attributed to rashba spin - orbit effects in the sample .",
    "this points to the necessity of obtaining a fuller understanding of the role played by this type of interactions .    motivated by the recent progress in this field",
    ", we pose the following question in this paper : what happens under the combined effect of current - induced dynamics and magnonic spin - transfer torque ? moreover , how will these phenomena be modified in the presence of spin - orbit interactions",
    "? we will show that the interplay between the torques induced by itinerant spin - polarized electrons , spin-@xmath0 particles , and magnons , spin-1 excitations , offers the possibility of _ reversed domain - wall motion in an oscillatory fashion_. more specifically , we shall demonstrate that the angular momentum transfer from spin - waves is able to completely reverse the motion of a domain - wall even after it has been accelerated by an electron - current .",
    "in addition to this , we demonstrate that the domain - wall motion may be fully terminated at predetermined locations due to the behavior of the magnonic spin - torque .",
    "the predicted effects do not rely on the presence of spin - orbit coupling , but we nevertheless study how the latter , if present , influences the domain - wall dynamics .",
    "the domain wall reversal and termination persists in the presence of weak spin - orbit interactions , whereas the dynamics display a very rich , yet complicated , behavior for stronger magnitude of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "these results are suggestive in terms of finding novel ways to manipulate domain - wall motion via an interplay of conventional current - induced dynamics with magnonic spin - transfer torque .",
    "we consider a model as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] : a magnetic wire of length @xmath1 with a head - to - head domain - wall .",
    "current may be injected into the system and the easy axis is chosen along the extension of the wire @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics of the local magnetic order parameter is governed by the landau - liftshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation , which for our purposes may be cast in the following dimensionless form @xcite : @xmath3 \\notag\\\\ & + \\alpha\\mathbf{m}\\times\\partial_\\tau\\mathbf{m } + j\\partial_\\zeta\\mathbf{m } -\\beta j\\mathbf{m}\\times\\partial_\\zeta\\mathbf{m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the normalized time- and spatial - coordinates , whereas @xmath6 is the gyromagnetic ratio and : @xmath7 the coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath9 are thus measures for the current - induced spin - transfer torque and the effective field originating from the rashba spin - orbit interaction , respectively . above , @xmath10 is the spin - polarization of the injected current , @xmath11 is the current density , @xmath12 is the gilbert damping constant , @xmath13 is the non - adiabaticity parameter , @xmath14 is the electron charge , @xmath15 represents the spin - orbit interaction strength , while @xmath16 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the term @xmath17 contains the contribution to the effective field from anisotropy , exchange stiffness , and external applications : @xmath18 we have introduced the normalized anisotropy coefficient @xmath19 , stiffness constant @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . here , @xmath22 is the saturation magnetization and @xmath23 is the magnetic permeability .",
    "it is noticed that the spin - orbit interaction in general induces two types of torques , both included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : llg ] ) : a standard field - like one in addition to a slonczewski - like torque , the latter one proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , such a torque was proposed in order to explain magnetization reversal by an in - plane current in @xcite , indicating that the field - like description of the spin - orbit torque would not suffice .    obtaining a general analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : llg ] ) is a formidable task .",
    "the walker prescription for a domain wall does not hold in general when including both magnon - induced torque , current - induced torque , and spin - orbit coupling , and is solvable only some limiting cases which narrows down the regime of validity considerably . for this reason , we proceed to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : llg ] ) in its full form numerically without any simplifying assumptions .",
    "the coupled equations for the components @xmath24 of the magnetization are supplemented with von neumann boundary conditions in order to obtain the local time - resolved magnetic order parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we are now interested in considering the interplay between conventional current - induced domain wall motion and the dynamics generated by magnonic spin - transfer torque absorption . to this end",
    ", we consider the scenario shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] : a spin - polarized current is injected into the ferromagnetic wire and causes the domain - wall to move along the @xmath26-direction .",
    "a spin - wave of frequency @xmath27 is generated by applying an external time - dependent field @xmath28 locally modelled with a gaussian function of small width .",
    "the position chosen for the local field ensures that there is no influence of spin - waves reflected at the ends of the magnetic nanowire within the considered time - domain .",
    "the domain - wall center is initially situated in the middle of the wire ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the resulting dynamics are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : without](a ) , where a contour - plot is shown of @xmath30 in the @xmath31-plane . at @xmath32 ,",
    "the magnetization changes sign at @xmath29 due to the domain - wall structure .",
    "the center of the domain - wall moves right due to the current injection at the same time as a spin - wave starts to propagate in the same direction .",
    "as the velocity of the spin - wave @xmath33 exceeds the domain - wall velocity @xmath34 , the spin - wave eventually impacts the center of the domain - wall and deposits its spin - transfer torque .",
    "remarkably , the domain - wall now reverses its direction and starts to propagate in the opposite direction in spite of the persistent spin - polarized current .",
    "the reversal of the domain - wall motion is seen to occur in a non - monotonous way .",
    "the turning points in the nearly oscillatory motion are seen to coincide with the maxima of the spin - wave amplitudes reaching the center of the domain - wall .",
    "this suggests that there is a persistent competition between the electric - current and magnonic spin - transfer torque : the absorption of angular momentum from the magnons reverses the domain - wall motion each time a spin - wave hits the center , whereas the electric current attempts to move it in the opposite direction . the net motion , however , is still reversed by the magnon - induced torque .",
    "we now contrast this finding with a scenario where the current - induced and magnonic torque conspire to move the domain - wall in the same direction .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : without](b ) . a previous work considering",
    "this particular situation @xcite found that the spin - waves could enhance the domain - wall velocity , as is also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : without](b ) : the domain - wall displays a small yet finite acceleration due to the angular momentum transfer from the magnons ( near @xmath35 in the plot ) .",
    "however , an additional effect may be inferred from this plot . when the domain - wall center reaches the spin - wave source , i.e. the position of the locally applied external field , it is arrested .",
    "the domain - wall structure remains well - defined , with its center now pinned _ in spite _ of the spin - polarized current injection .",
    "although the locally applied external field poses an experimental challenge , there exists present - day techniques to accomplish this aim in magnetic nanowires @xcite based on _ e.g. _ generating current pulses through levels of copper metal lines in order to generate local fields along the nanowire .",
    "this effect would make possible controllable movement of the domain - wall to pre - determined locations .    in order to understand the underlying physical mechanism for the termination of the domain - wall motion , it is instructive to consider a simplified analytical model for the time - evolution of the spin - waves . following a similar prescription as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we model the generated spin - wave as a small fluctuation around the original domain - wall configuration : @xmath36 , where the angular unit vectors are defined relative @xmath37 . inserting the standard walker - ansatz with @xmath38 while keeping the exchange stiffness and anisotropy terms , we similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite find that the solution for the spin - wave may be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spin - wave magnitude and @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the anisotropy constant . in the presence of damping",
    ", @xmath43 becomes imaginary .",
    "although this expression no longer strictly holds when including additional terms , such as the spin - orbit interaction , it demonstrates the fundamental mechanism of the magnon spin - transfer torque .",
    "a wave incoming from one side @xmath44 reverses its spin as it passes through the domain - wall @xmath45 , thus depositing a torque of spin angular momentum which causes the domain - wall to propagate in the opposite direction .",
    "based on this observation , we may now explain why the domain - wall motion is arrested . in fig .",
    "[ fig : without ] , the spin - waves initially deposit their spin torque to the domain - wall when approaching it from the left side , causing it to move in the same direction .",
    "however , when the domain - wall has travelled far enough to pass the point where the spin - waves are generated , the spin - waves now impinge on the domain - wall center from the right side and thus causes it to move in the _ opposite _ direction .",
    "as long as the magnon torque exceeds the current - induced torque , this suggests that the domain - wall will be pinned in a specific location .",
    "we now consider in more detail how the magnetization dynamics , and in particular the reversal and termination of the domain - wall motion , depends on the field - frequency @xmath27 and the spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath9 .",
    "this is done by including a finite value of @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : llg ] ) , which models the influence of the effective field induced by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "since this field is proportional to the applied current , we require that @xmath46 = @xmath47 , and note that the spin - orbit field changes direction along with the current . as with the other current - induced terms",
    ", there is an adiabatic and non - adiabatic contribution to this term , the latter proportional to @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : with1 ] , a spatiotemporal map of the domain - wall motion is provided for several values of @xmath27 and @xmath9 in the case where the current @xmath8 is applied in the same direction as the magnon induced domain - wall motion . for small values of @xmath27 ,",
    "the magnons have only a minor effect on the domain - wall velocity whereas with increasing @xmath27 , the domain - wall is accelerated to begin with .",
    "this is reasonable as the magnon - generation should be less efficient as the field becomes more constant , @xmath48 .",
    "however , the change in dynamics as the frequency is increased is more complicated than merely an increase in the domain - wall velocity .",
    "in fact , there seems to be an intermediate region around @xmath49 where the domain - wall structure is less clearly defined .",
    "this indicates that there may exist a resonance frequency regime where the domain - wall profile is more easily modified .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity ] the frequency - dependence of the domain - wall velocity induced by the magnons in the absence of any spin - polarized current .",
    "as seen , there is an optimal frequency - regime where the induced velocity is at its maximum .",
    "such a non - montonic dependence on the field - frequency @xmath27 is consistent with the observations in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "turning to the role of the spin - orbit interactions , there are two interesting features emerging from fig .",
    "[ fig : with1 ] .",
    "firstly , it is seen that the general trend of the spin - orbit coupling is to destabilize the domain - wall profile , inducing an oscillating magnetization pattern .",
    "secondly , the termination effect of the domain - wall motion is cancelled for sufficiently strong spin - orbit coupling @xmath50 ) . to understand these features",
    ", one may note that the influence of spin - orbit coupling in the effective field is seen to mainly amount to a current - dependent field in the transverse direction of the wire .",
    "the transverse spin - orbit field eventually destabilizes the domain - wall structure after the application of a current .",
    "the magnetization dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : with1 ] suggest that the influence of the magnon - induced torque is suppressed as the spin - orbit coupling is increased .",
    "the same tendency is found with regard to the domain - wall reversal shown in fig . [",
    "fig : with2 ] , where the current is applied in the opposite direction .",
    "the frequency - dependence is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : with1 ] : the magnon - induced torque becomes smaller with decreasing @xmath27 and there is no reversal below a threshold value @xmath51 .",
    "in addition to the destabilized domain structure induced by increasing spin - orbit coupling , it is seen that the domain - wall reversal also becomes less efficient with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "this supports the conclusion that the spin - orbit interaction suppresses the influence of the magnons in the system .",
    "although an analytical description of the precise frequency - dependence is not possible to achieve , it is clear from the numerical results that the domain - wall reversal and termination are only stable as long as the spin - orbit interaction is sufficiently small ( we find that the qualitative behavior in fig . [",
    "fig : without ] persists up to around @xmath52 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the interplay between the torque exerted by a spin - polarized current and magnons on a domain - wall present in a ferromagnetic wire . using a realistic set of parameters",
    ", we have demonstrated that the magnon - induced torque is capable of reversing the domain - wall motion in an oscillatory fashion .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the domain - wall motion may be be terminated and pinned at specific locations determined by the origin of the spin - waves .",
    "we have also considered how the presence of spin - orbit interactions influences the above results .",
    "these phenomena might open new perspectives with regard to control and manipulation of domain - wall motion as compared to the conventional mean of current - induced torque .",
    "our dimensionless parameters correspond to the real unit values @xmath22 = 5@xmath53 a / m , @xmath54 t , @xmath55 j / m , @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath58 m , @xmath59 a/@xmath60 , and @xmath61 ghz , which correspond well with an experimentally relevant scenario @xcite ."
