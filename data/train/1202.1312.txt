    "heavy quarkonium has been studied in great detail both experimentally and theoretically .",

    "furthermore , the coefficients of the leading spin - dependent operators , which are of order @xmath19 , are tuned nonperturbatively .    as usual in lattice qcd , the euclidean path integral",

    "going through the derivation of the interpolating operators also gives some insight into the structure of the @xmath1 states extracted in the numerical part of the calculation .",
    "however , it is important to remember that the spectrum calculated here is that of the ( lattice ) qcd+nrqcd hamiltonian : @xmath28 .",
    "the interpolating operators determine only the overlap factors @xmath29 , not the energies @xmath30 .",
    "for the numerical calculation it is nevertheless advantageous to construct operators that have large overlaps only with selected @xmath1 states , to get good statistical precision for the energy levels and identify their angular momentum @xmath31 .    a key feature of the approach from ref .",
