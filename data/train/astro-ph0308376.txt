    "recent x - ray observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) show that there must be some heat source balancing the radiative cooling of hot gas in galaxy clusters .",
    "current ideas include ( 1 ) heat transport from the outer regions of the cluster to the center by thermal conduction ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter zn03 ) , ( 2 ) energy injection by jets or radiation from a central active galactic nucleus ( agn ; @xcite ) , or ( 3 ) a combination of both ( e.g. , zn03 , @xcite ) .",
    "models based on electron conduction are able to reproduce the observed profiles of gas density and temperature in several clusters ( zn03 ) .",
    "the models are also much less unstable than models without conduction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kn03 ) .",
    "these features make the conduction model rather attractive .",
    "in addition to conduction , another diffusive process that may be potentially important in galaxy clusters is turbulent mixing .",
    "clusters are highly dynamic entities that are constantly being stirred by the infall of groups and subclusters , the motions of galaxies , and outflows from agn .",
    "the dynamical motions supply a large amount of turbulent kinetic energy , perhaps comparable to the thermal energy of the cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the turbulence also causes diffusive mixing which tends to erase gradients in the specific entropy and chemical composition @xcite and transports heat efficiently @xcite .",
    "the latter feature of turbulence is the focus of this letter .",
    "we describe a model of galaxy clusters in which turbulent heat transport balances radiative cooling of the hot gas , and we show that this model is consistent with a wide range of observations .",
    "in the presence of turbulence , gas elements move around randomly and transport specific entropy from one point to another .",
    "when the elements mix , there is a net heat flux from regions of higher entropy to regions of lower entropy .",
    "the heat flux due to turbulence is thus proportional to the entropy gradient and may be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gas density , @xmath5 is the temperature , and @xmath6 is the entropy per unit mass . the diffusion constant @xmath7 is expected to be of order @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the rms turbulent velocity and @xmath10 is the coherence length of the velocity field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we expect @xmath11 to be a fraction of the sound speed @xmath12 ( the only relevant velocity in the problem ) and @xmath10 to be a fraction of the local pressure scale height @xmath13 ( the obvious scale , as in the mixing length theory of convection ) . over most of the cluster ,",
    "the scale @xmath13 is comparable to the radius , but it is of order the core radius @xmath14 inside the core ( see zn03 for the definition of @xmath14 ) .",
    "these arguments lead to the scalings for @xmath7 and @xmath13 shown in equation ( [ tflux ] ) .",
    "the specific entropy for a classical perfect gas is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the pressure , @xmath17 is the specific heat at constant volume , and @xmath18 is the adiabatic index of the gas .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric cluster in hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the gravitational potential .",
    "we assume steady state , so that the radiative cooling of each gas element is balanced by the divergence of @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radiative energy loss rate per unit volume . for @xmath24 kev",
    ", @xmath23 is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung from free electrons and ions , while for lower temperatures it is mostly due to atomic transitions .",
    "we should note that the assumption of steady state is a strong simplification .",
    "since turbulent motions in a cluster are likely to be episodic , e.g. , as a result of agn activity @xcite or sub - cluster infall and merger @xcite , equations ( [ tflux ] ) and ( [ engy ] ) should be viewed as time - averaged relations .",
    "using the expressions for @xmath25 and @xmath23 given in zn03 , we have solved the basic equations described above to calculate the radial profiles of the electron number density @xmath26 and temperature @xmath27 . for each cluster , we selected different values for the the inner gas density @xmath28 and inner temperature @xmath29 as well as the mixing parameter @xmath0 , and integrated the steady state equations numerically .",
    "we compared the calculated profiles of density and temperature with the data and computed the @xmath30 of the fit . in those cases where the published data had no error estimates",
    ", we arbitrarily assumed that the errors are 15% of the measured values . also , in some clusters we pruned the density data so as to have equal numbers of data points in the density and temperature profiles . by minimizing @xmath30 , we determined the optimum values of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath31 for each cluster .",
    "table [ tbl1 ] shows the results of fitting the turbulent mixing model to the ten clusters analyzed by zn03 .",
    "zn03 found that five of these clusters could be explained with the thermal conduction model , while five required unphysically high levels of conduction and were inconsistent . with the turbulent mixing model",
    ", however , we find that we obtain fairly good fits for all ten clusters , with reasonably small ( and physically justifiable ) values of @xmath31 .",
    "the five clusters ( a1795 , a1835 , a2199 , a2390 , and rx j1347.5 - 1145 ) that zn03 found to be consistent with conduction have a median @xmath0 of 0.013 , while the other five clusters ( a2052 , a2597 , hydra a , ser 159 - 03 , and 3c 295 ) have a median @xmath0 of 0.026 .",
    "the larger @xmath0 in the latter group may reflect the fact that these clusters have powerful agn that cause extra turbulence .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the results of the model - fitting for two clusters , a1795 ( one of the better - fitting clusters ) and hydra a ( the worst example ) .",
    "we see that the mixing model is generally consistent with the observations , though the @xmath30 is not always small .",
    "apart from providing a qualitative explanation for the observed density and temperature profiles of cluster gas , another major attraction of the thermal conduction model of zn03 is the fact that conduction helps to control the thermal instability of the gas ( kn03 ) .",
    "we have now repeated the global stability analysis of kn03 for the turbulent mixing model . for a1795 , with @xmath32 , we find that mixing suppresses the instability in all radial modes except the fundamental ( nodeless ) mode .",
    "the growth time of the lone unstable mode is very much longer than the hubble time . in the case of hydra",
    "a , with @xmath33 ( and thus a larger @xmath7 ) , we find that all modes , including the nodeless fundamental mode , are stable .",
    "thus , the equilibrium models described here are for all practical purposes stable .",
    "groups and clusters of galaxies form when primordial density perturbations in the universe grow , gravitationally collapse , and merge together according to the standard hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "the statistical properties of these collapsed systems contain many clues to the process of cosmic structure formation .",
    "numerous x - ray studies have been published on the power - law scalings of the size , temperature , x - ray luminosity , mass , entropy , and gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters .",
    "the best fit values of the power - law indices depend on the particular sample of clusters used and on the specific methods employed to estimate the mass and temperature .",
    "nevertheless , there is a broad consensus on the observed scalings as functions of temperature @xmath5 , as summarized in the first three columns of table [ tbl2 ] . a clear break in cluster properties is seen at a characteristic temperature @xmath34 kev .",
    "small clusters and galaxy groups are found to have a relatively constant entropy .",
    "the prevailing explanations for this surprising `` entropy floor '' include ( 1 ) pre - heating of intracluster gas @xcite via galactic winds @xcite , agn @xcite , and accretion shocks @xcite , ( 2 ) removal of cold , low - entropy gas via galaxy formation in clusters @xcite , and ( 3 ) both radiative cooling and supernova feedback @xcite .",
    "none of these models includes the effects of thermal conduction or turbulent mixing .",
    "when thermal conduction by electrons is the dominant heating mechanism , the local heat flux is given by @xmath35 , with @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath37 kev , we may assume @xmath38 , corresponding to thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "then , using equation ( [ engy ] ) and substituting @xmath39 , we find that the gas density in equilibrium scales as @xmath40 , which gives a gas mass @xmath41 , gas fraction @xmath42 , x - ray luminosity @xmath43 , and entropy @xmath44 .",
    "for the mixing model , on the other hand , equation ( [ tflux ] ) with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , combined with equation ( 2 ) , yields @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "these scaling relations are shown in the last two columns of table [ tbl2 ] . remarkably , the turbulent mixing model yields scaling relations for @xmath52 kev that are in very good agreement with observations .",
    "the scalings obtained with the conduction model agree less well .    at lower temperatures ,",
    "the resonance radiation of highly ionized metals like o , si , and fe are responsible for most of the cooling . from the equilibrium cooling functions provided by @xcite",
    ", we approximately obtain @xmath53 for @xmath54 kev ( for a plasma with solar to half - solar metal abundance ) .",
    "following the same steps as above , this gives a different set of scaling relations , as shown in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "both the conduction and the mixing model predict a dramatic change in the scaling below @xmath55 kev , in agreement with the observations .",
    "the entropy floor that is observed in small clusters and groups is also reproduced naturally in the models .",
    "diffusive processes are quite attractive as a heat source in galaxy clusters since they transport energy to the cluster centers from the outside , and also help to control the thermal instability . in this letter , we have presented equilibrium models of galaxy clusters in which the hot gas maintains energy balance between radiative cooling and heating by turbulent mixing . to quantify the amount of heat transported by mixing , we adopt a mixing length prescription in which the heat flux is proportional to the local gradient of specific entropy , with a diffusion coefficient parameterized by a dimensionless constant @xmath0 ( eq .  [ [ tflux ] ] ) .",
    "the mixing model fits the observed density and temperature profiles of hot gas in clusters fairly well (  3 , fig .",
    "the resulting gas configurations are also very stable . in both respects ,",
    "the mixing model performs better than the conduction model .",
    "this is presumably because turbulent mixing transports energy more efficiently in the low - temperature high - density cores of clusters @xcite .    what is the origin of the turbulence invoked in the mixing model",
    "? it could be from the infall of subclusters , the motion of the dark matter potential , the orbital motions of galaxies , or energy input from an agn .",
    "@xcite studied the turbulence generated by motions of individual galaxies and found that the diffusion constant is @xmath56 in the coma and perseus clusters .",
    "@xcite found that the turbulent velocities driven by cluster mergers are generally subsonic , with @xmath57 .",
    "it is difficult to measure the coherence length of the velocity field , but faraday depolarization measurements suggest that @xmath58 kpc for magnetic field tangling near the centers of typical clusters ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the corresponding diffusion coefficient is @xmath59 . in comparison ,",
    "the values of @xmath1 required in the mixing models presented here correspond to @xmath60 for @xmath61 kpc .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the other independent estimates .",
    "as shown in  3 , some clusters that contain relatively strong agn have somewhat larger values of @xmath0 compared to clusters that do not have obvious agn activity .",
    "this is natural if jets from the agn cause some of the turbulence in the centers of these clusters .",
    "the influence of agn jets has been studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who showed that powerful jets mix gas with different entropy and thereby greatly reduce the mass deposition rate in cluster cores .",
    "@xcite , in particular , showed that the entropy increase at the cluster center is quite insensitive to the amount of energy injection by agn , which is consistent with our result that the values of @xmath0 in agn - dominated clusters are within a factor of 2 of those in clusters without strong agn .",
    "the model considered in this paper is highly idealized . in reality",
    ", we expect both turbulent mixing and electron conduction to influence heat transport in clusters .",
    "mixing may be inhomogeneous , e.g. , a central agn may induce more efficient mixing near the cluster center compared to the outer regions .",
    "mixing is also likely to be variable in time .",
    "these effects need to be investigated in more detail .",
    "another problem is that we have not considered how a cluster got to the state it is observed in .",
    "@xcite showed that cluster models with thermal conduction have two very distinct states , one that is unstable and develops a cooling flow and one that is stable but nearly isothermal .",
    "equilibrium models with cool cores occur only near the boundary between the two states .",
    "mixing will probably give similar results .",
    "it is presently unclear in either model how a cluster that begins from generic initial conditions can end up in such an apparently non - generic final state .    despite the above uncertainties ,",
    "if we assume that all galaxy groups and clusters are in thermal steady state ( at least in a time - averaged sense ) , with a balance between cooling and heating via turbulent heat transport , and if we further assume that @xmath0 is roughly constant across the entire population , then the model makes clear predictions for how various cluster properties should scale as a function of temperature (  4 , table 2 ) .",
    "remarkably , the predicted scalings obtained with the mixing model are in excellent agreement with observations . the model also explains the observed discontinuity in cluster properties at @xmath2 kev as a consequence of the change in the cooling function at this temperature , and provides a natural explanation for the entropy floor seen in galaxy groups . these results , though not inconsistent with some of the previously proposed explanations ( see references in  4 ) , suggest that those models should be generalized to include the effect of turbulent heat transport .    after this paper",
    "was submitted to the journal , voigt & fabian posted a paper ( astro - ph/0308352 ) in which they have suggested independently that turbulent heat transport may be important in galaxy clusters .",
    "the authors thank nadia zakamska and larry david for providing the cluster data shown in figure 1 , and the referee for helpful comments .",
