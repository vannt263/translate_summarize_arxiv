    "the properties of low mass dwarf galaxies , and their differences from luminous galaxies , provide important clues to understanding both cosmology and galaxy formation . as probes of galaxy formation , dwarf galaxies should be extremely sensitive to processes such as star formation feedback , ram pressure stripping , and tidal stripping .",
    "these processes are often invoked to explain properties of relatively luminous galaxies and should even more dramatically affect dwarf galaxies , which have smaller masses and shallower potential wells . as probes of cosmology ,",
    "the number of dwarf galaxies has provided a challenge for cosmological models .",
    "the current cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ( @xmath7cdm ; @xcite ) makes robust predictions for the number of dark matter halos as a function of mass @xcite .",
    "however , extending this model to predict the number density of observed galaxies requires including physical effects such as gas cooling , star - formation , supernova feedback , etc .",
    ", that are too complex to follow exactly in numerical predictions .",
    "it is clear that the number of galaxies as a function of luminosity is much shallower than the prediction for the number as a function of halo mass @xcite .",
    "the most extreme example of this problem is the `` substructure problem '' in the local group @xcite .",
    "if we assume galaxies are associated one - to - one with dark matter halos and that @xmath7cdm is correct , the mass - to - light ratios of galaxies therefore must decline as a function of host halo mass . that is , the efficiency of forming stars and/or retaining gas must be much smaller for low mass galaxies .",
    "a number of physical models have been proposed to explain high mass - to - light ratios in low mass galaxies , including photoevaporation of gas during reionization @xcite , suppression of gas accretion during reionization @xcite , feedback from supernovae @xcite , and ram pressure stripping of gas @xcite .",
    "some of these processes only occur for dwarf galaxies near a luminous galaxy and not for isolated ones @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of these processes in the evolution of dwarf galaxies has significant implications for galaxies of all sizes at both low and high redshift .",
    "for example , the importance of galactic winds in low mass galaxies will strongly affect our understanding of the mass - metallicity relation @xcite and the enrichment of the intergalactic medium at high redshift @xcite . by comparing the gas content and tully - fisher relationships of dwarfs as a function of environment",
    ", it should be possible to determine the importance of `` external '' environmental effects like stripping relative to `` internal '' effects such as feedback .",
    "historically , extremely low luminosity nearby galaxies have been difficult to find because their colors and apparent sizes are similar to those of more luminous , and far more numerous , background galaxies . by far",
    "the best known set of dwarfs is that in the local group @xcite , where the even the lowest mass dwarfs can be detected as over - densities in stellar counts @xcite .",
    "the dwarf galaxy population has also been well studied in nearby clusters , such as virgo and fornax , where the number of dwarfs is large relative the background population @xcite or in other environments where dwarfs are expected , eg .  as satellites to bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "assembling samples of dwarfs in more distant and less dense environments has been challenging .",
    "using criteria such as surface brightness and irregularity , several authors have assembled large catalogs of nearby dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "addressing the above issues requires a large sample of galaxies across a range of environments , with minimal selection effects .",
    "deep , wide - field optical spectroscopic surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , provide a large , homogeneous sample of dwarf galaxies covering a wide range of galactic properties and environments .",
    "concurrently , blind hi surveys such as the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ; @xcite ) and the upcoming arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ; @xcite ) will provide similarly large samples , with a very complementary set of selection effects .",
    "unlike present - day massive disk galaxies , which have used up much of their gas reservoirs @xcite , the gaseous component of dwarf galaxies can not be ignored @xcite .",
    "indeed , we show that at the lowest luminosities dwarf galaxies are _ mostly _ neutral gas .",
    "a galaxy s gas content reflects the efficiency of star formation modified by processes which add or removal gas from the system such as gas infall or ram pressure stripping .",
    "the goal of this paper is to combine the optical properties , dynamics and neutral gas content of low mass dwarf galaxies in order to better understand the processes important in dwarf galaxy evolution .",
    "we present neutral hydrogen ( hi ) observations for 101  low luminosity dwarf galaxies selected with uniform and well - understood criteria from the sdss .",
    "we describe the catalog from which these dwarfs were selected in ",
    "[ ssec_sample ] , estimate the environment of each object in  [ ssec_environ ] and discuss the hi observations in ",
    "[ ssec_redux_hi ] .",
    "we investigate correlations between the gas fraction , color , star formation rate and environment of this sample in  [ ssec_fgas ] and the tully - fisher relationship in  [ ssec_tf ] .",
    "when necessary , we assume a hubble constant of h@xmath8mpc km  s@xmath5  where @xmath9 .",
    "we selected dwarf galaxies with magnitude @xmath10 for hi observations from the low luminosity galaxy catalog of @xcite , a subsample of the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on the sdss @xcite data release 2 ( dr2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xcite catalog represents a significant improvement over simply selecting galaxies from the sdss catalog , which is not optimized for nearby , low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "it is a flux - limited sample selected with an optical apparent magnitude limit of @xmath11 . for each galaxy ,",
    "the catalog provides the sdss redshift , multi - band photometry , structural measurements ( in particular , two - dimensional srsic  fits as described in @xcite ) and emission line measurements @xcite .",
    "distances are estimated based on a model of the local velocity field @xcite .",
    "distance errors have been folded into error estimations of all distance - dependent quantities such as absolute magnitude and hi mass .    there are two selection effects of the @xcite catalog relevant to this analysis : ( 1 ) the sdss flux limit at @xmath11 restricts the detection of galaxies with @xmath12 to within 60mpc in distance ( 20mpc for the least luminous galaxies , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the catalog therefore does not span the full range of galaxy environments . while there are plenty of voids and groups in this volume",
    ", there are few very dense regions .",
    "for example , given the angular limits of the sdss dr2 , we see only the fringes of the virgo cluster .",
    "( 2 ) the catalog does not include low surface brightness galaxies . as shown in @xcite , the sdss completeness as a function of half - light surface brightness drops below 50% at @xmath14 mag arcsec@xmath15 .",
    "in the absolute magnitude range of interest , we would miss half of the dwarf galaxies in the local group @xcite given this surface brightness cutoff . according to the definition of @xcite , 10% of our sample galaxies",
    "are considered low surface brightness ( lsb ) with @xmath16 . with the exception of these two selection effects , the blanton et al .",
    "spectroscopic catalog is not selected by galaxy property in any particular way .",
    "for example , galaxies have not been selected for or against irregular looking morphologies .",
    "we present here hi observations for 101  dwarf galaxies in the absolute magnitude range @xmath17 selected from the @xcite catalog .",
    "these data are part of a larger , on - going survey to obtain hi line - widths and h@xmath18 rotation curves for a significant fraction of galaxies in this catalog with @xmath19 .",
    "the complete catalog contains 1034 galaxies at these luminosities .",
    "the 101  galaxies presented here are representative of the full catalog .",
    "a goal of this paper is to understand the effects of environment on the properties of dwarf galaxies .",
    "to quantify the environment , we calculate for each dwarf galaxy the projected distance to its nearest luminous neighbor .",
    "we can not rely on the sdss alone to determine this distance for several reasons .",
    "first , the angular distances between nearest neighbor galaxies can be large for this nearby sample for example , searching a 1mpc region around a galaxy 30mpc away corresponds to 2 degrees on the sky .",
    "many of our dwarf galaxies are on the sdss southern stripes , which are only 2.5 degrees wide .",
    "in addition , because the sdss reduction software is not optimized for large extended objects , and fails to process them correctly , the sdss catalog does not contain many of the bright galaxies within 30mpc .",
    "thus , to calculate the environments of our dwarf galaxy sample , we need a supplemental catalog that extends beyond the sdss area and contains the brightest galaxies .",
    "both of these considerations drive us to use the the third reference catalog of galaxies ( rc3 ; @xcite ) , which is a nearly complete catalog of nearby luminous galaxies . to determine environments for our dwarf galaxies",
    ", we determine the distance to its nearest `` luminous '' neighbor .",
    "we define `` luminous '' galaxies as brighter than @xmath20 or have circular velocities greater than @xmath21 km  s@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "while we would like to include galaxies of all sizes in our environment estimate , the availability of a complete comparison catalog restricts our search to luminous neighbors . from the @xmath22 and @xmath23 photometry listed in rc3 , we infer @xmath24 for each rc3 galaxy using the kcorrect product ( see  [ ssec_fgas ] ) . for galaxies which have the relevant entries listed , we call galaxies luminous if @xmath25 .",
    "while this absolute magnitude is set by the catalog limits , it roughly corresponds to the dividing line between normal and dwarf galaxies . for rc3 galaxies which do not have the relevant entries , but do have hi data listed , we call them luminous if @xmath26 km s@xmath5 ( @xmath27 is twice the maximum circular velocity of the hi gas , see  [ ssec_redux_hi ] ) . finally , there are some galaxies with neither hi data nor optical photometry listed in rc3 . for this small set ,",
    "we extract the `` magnitude '' from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , which empirically is very similar to the @xmath22 band rc3 magnitude , and guess @xmath24 based on that magnitude . additionally , we update the coordinates in rc3 using the ned coordinates for each of the catalog objects .",
    "this set of bright galaxies is not perfectly uniform , but is suitable for our purposes .    to determine the nearest neighbor distance",
    ", we ask whether there is a luminous rc3 neighbor within a projected distance of 2.5 @xmath28 mpc and 300 km  s@xmath5  in redshift for each dwarf galaxy in our sample .",
    "we choose these limits because @xcite have shown that environmental affects are strongest inside this scale .",
    "about 20% of our galaxies have no such neighbor ; for these objects , we set the nearest neighbor distance to 2.5mpc . using the sdss catalog archive server , we have looked at wide field mosaic images around all of our objects and checked by eye that the rc3 catalog object is indeed the nearest bright neighbor .",
    "this check is not perfect due to the edge effects of sdss , but provides a sanity check on our procedure .",
    "we obtained hi radio observations with the arecibo 305-m telescope and the green bank 100-m telescope ( gbt ) in july ",
    "august 2005 and march ",
    "april 2006 . at arecibo",
    ", we used the l - wide receiver in 9-level sampling mode with 1024 channels and a 12.5mhz bandwidth . at gbt",
    ", we used the l - band with 8192 channels and a bandwidth of 12.5mhz . the arecibo configuration yields a velocity resolution of 2.5 km  s@xmath5 , the gbt configuration yields a resolution of 0.3 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "standard on / off position switching was used during both the arecibo and gbt observations .",
    "the total on - source integration times were on average 10  minutes for the arecibo data and 20  minutes for the gbt data .",
    "the average half - light radius of the dwarf galaxies in our sample is @xmath29 and they should be completely contained within the radio beamsize of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for arecibo and gbt , respectively .",
    "we have searched the beam coverage for nearby contaminating galaxies and have removed the few cases in which a nearby galaxy is contained in the beam and is within 100 km  s@xmath5  of the targeted galaxy .",
    "optical images and hi profiles for three representative galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig_imgprof ] .",
    "our observations yielded strong hi detections for 88  of 101  galaxies .",
    "the 13  galaxies which did not yield hi detections are represented by upper limits in the analysis of  [ ssec_fgas ] and are excluded from the tully - fisher analysis in  [ ssec_tf ] , since we can not estimate hi line - widths for these galaxies .",
    "we compute the 20% hi line - width ( w20 ) by finding the peak hi flux within 150 km  s@xmath5  of the optical radial velocity of each galaxy and computing the difference between the nearest points having 20% of the peak flux .",
    "the integrated hi flux is calculated by expanding the w20 values by 20 km  s@xmath5  on a side and integrating the flux in this region .",
    "errors bars on the line widths and integrated fluxes were computed using a monte carlo bootstrap method : noise was added to the stacked one - dimensional radio spectra based on the observed variance in the baseline and the observed quantities measured .",
    "error bars on the line - width and integrated flux were calculated from the scatter in the mean quantities recovered form the monte carlo simulations .",
    "we convert the hi integrated flux into hi mass based on the optically - thin approximation : @xmath32 where d is the distance in mpc and @xmath33 is the integrated hi flux in jy km s@xmath5 ( eqn .  9 ;",
    "we note that this standard hi mass conversion is a lower limit to the true hi mass if the galaxy contains optically thick hi .",
    "error bars on the hi mass include the hi flux error and the error in the distance .",
    "the 101  dwarf galaxies presented in this paper represent the largest homogeneous sample of galaxies fainter than @xmath34 with well - measured hi and optical properties .",
    "properties of the sample are listed in table  1 ; the distribution of these properties is shown in figure  [ fig_hist ] .",
    "the average absolute magnitude , corrected for galactic extinction @xcite , of our sample is @xmath35 at an average distance of 30@xmath28mpc .",
    "galaxies in the sample tend to be blue , @xmath36 = 0.3 , reflecting the fact that our sample does not probe the densest environments where red dwarf ellipticals tend to reside .",
    "the galaxies have an average effective surface brightness of @xmath37 mag arcsec@xmath15 , and exponential surface brightness profiles as measured by the srsic  index ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the average effective half - light @xmath39-band radius is @xmath40@xmath28kpc .",
    "these galaxies exist in environments ranging from dense groups to truly isolated objects : about 15% of the sample are satellites of luminous host galaxies , defined as being within 200 @xmath28kpc projected distance and 300 km s@xmath5 in velocity of a galaxies with @xmath41 ( see  [ ssec_environ ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , about 65% of the galaxies are further than 500 @xmath28 kpc of any such host galaxy  they are very isolated galaxies .",
    "the dwarf galaxies in our sample were not selected with respect to morphology or gas content .",
    "the sample consists of @xmath42% gas - poor dwarf galaxies commonly known as `` dwarf spheroidal '' or `` dwarf elliptical '' galaxies .",
    "the majority of our sample consists of gas - rich dwarfs commonly known as `` dwarf irregular '' galaxies .",
    "this latter term is commonly misinterpreted to mean that gas - rich dwarf galaxies have disorganized morphology or turbulent kinematics .",
    "historically , the term `` irregular '' indicates that the hii regions in a galaxy do not follow a regular spiral arm pattern as observed in normal massive disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , our sample dwarf galaxies do not show any evidence of spiral structure , based on the visual inspection of unsharp - masked sdss @xmath39-band images . however , our dwarfs do have well - defined optical centers and regular morphology ( figure  [ fig_imgprof ] ) as has been noted by previous studies of dwarf galaxies in this regime @xcite .",
    "our hi radio profile shapes suggest that our dwarf galaxies have regular rotation fields : 18% of the hi profiles have distinct double - peaked shapes implying a coherent rotation field ; this fraction increases to 30% if we limit the sample to edge - on galaxies ( @xmath43 ) only .",
    "thus while the classification `` dwarf irregular '' is correct for the majority of our sample galaxies , due to its common misinterpretation , we simply refer to all the galaxies in this sample simply as low luminosity dwarf galaxies .",
    "we first investigate the ratio of gas mass to total baryonic mass in our dwarf galaxy sample .",
    "we define the gas fraction as @xmath44 .",
    "the denominator of this expression is the total baryonic mass defined as the sum of the gas and stellar mass .",
    "we take @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is calculated in ",
    "[ ssec_redux_hi ] and the multiplicative factor takes in account the presence of helium and metals .",
    "we do not include a correction term for molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath47 ) as the h@xmath48hi ratio is much lower in dwarf galaxies compared to luminous spirals @xcite .",
    "this deficiency holds even after accounting for a strong metallicity dependence of the h@xmath47 tracer molecule co @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass , @xmath49 , is based on the optical sdss @xmath50-band magnitude and @xmath51 colors using the mass - to - light ratios determined from the galaxy evolution models of @xcite using the @xcite initial mass function ( that is , we subtract 0.15 dex from bell et al .  table  7 calculated for a diet salpeter initial mass function ) .",
    "we choose this combination of magnitude and color to minimize contamination from emission lines and thus probe the `` true '' stellar continuum @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the stellar mass based on the broad - band fluxes using the kcorrect product and based on the spectra published by @xcite .",
    "both these methods produce somewhat lower stellar mass ( @xmath52 ) than predicted by bell et al .",
    "we stress that the mass - to - light ratios are very sensitive to the assumed initial mass function .",
    "we note that the gas fraction does not depend on the distance to individual galaxies .",
    "the average gas fraction for our sample is @xmath530.6 , with gas fractions as high as 95% .",
    "thus , for the majority of the dwarf galaxies in our sample , the baryonic mass is dominated by gas , rather than stars . in figure  [ fig_gas ]",
    "we plot gas fraction as a function of absolute @xmath39-band magnitude .",
    "the flux limits of our sample are clearly seen in this figure .",
    "we compare our results to representative samples from the literature by converting the literature magnitudes to @xmath39-band using the photometric transformations from kcorrect ( see the web page referenced above ) and recalculate gas fractions using the same methods described above .",
    "the most comparable sample of galaxies is that of lsb dwarf galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the gas fractions in this sample are comparable to our sdss ( higher surface brightness ) sample . for more luminous spiral galaxies ,",
    "the average gas fraction is much lower : @xcite find an average gas fraction of 30% for a sample of low - inclination spiral galaxies .",
    "the average gas fraction for the large field spiral sample of @xcite is 25% , assuming an average color @xmath54 .",
    "a clear trend is seen in figure  [ fig_gas ] : less luminous galaxies tend toward higher gas fractions .",
    "while galaxies exist in the lower left region of the plot ( faint , gas - poor dwarf elliptical or dwarf spheroidal galaxies ) , they are rare in the upper right region ( based on the hipass sample , west et al .  in prep ) . in other words ,",
    "galaxies fainter than @xmath55 span the full range of possible gas fractions , while there is an upper limit to the gas fractions of brighter galaxies which depends on absolute magnitude .",
    "this trend has been noted by several authors @xcite ; figure  [ fig_gas ] extends this to significantly fainter absolute magnitudes compared to previous studies .",
    "we interpret the gas fractions in figure  [ fig_gas ] as evidence that , compared to more luminous galaxies , dwarf galaxies are far less efficient at turning gas into stars over their lifetimes .",
    "this is likely related to lower on average gas surface densities in lower luminosity systems .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and references therein have shown for luminous galaxies that star formation does not occur below a critical gas density ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "@xcite confirm that this limit holds for low mass systems , although the critical density is slightly lower ( @xmath57 ) , due in part to the lack of spiral arms and solid - body kinematics in the inner regions of dwarfs .",
    "we can not precisely measure the average gas density in this sample because our hi single - dish observations do not provide an estimate of the hi radius .",
    "however , we can estimate the hi radius by assuming it scales ( roughly ) with the optical radius .",
    "we adopt an average hi - to - optical radius scaling calculated by @xcite of @xmath58 .",
    "the average gas density of our sample is @xmath59 with more than a factor of two scatter .",
    "thus , the majority of galaxies in this sample are at , or below , the critical gas density required for star formation .",
    "if the threshold described in @xcite exists , the star formation in these dwarf galaxies implies that the local density of gas in the regions of star formation significantly exceeds the global density averaged over the whole galaxy .    in the top right panel of figure  [ fig_sfr ]",
    ", we show that the gas fraction is a strong function of @xmath60 color in the sense that bluer galaxies in our sample are gas - rich .",
    "we assume that the spread in @xmath60 color represents a spread in time - averaged star formation over the past 1gyr , as opposed to a spread in metallicity , for two reasons .",
    "first , the bluest colors in our sample can not be explained by old , metal poor stellar population synthesis models .",
    "second , the majority of galaxies in our sample are currently forming stars ( as indicated by h@xmath18 emission in the sdss spectra ) which dominates their broad - band colors @xcite .",
    "thus , in the top left of figure  [ fig_sfr ] , the gas - rich galaxies have had a higher fraction of their star - formation in the recent past .",
    "in contrast , the current star formation rate per unit area ( within the last few million years ) is not correlated with gas fraction ( figure  [ fig_sfr ] , bottom left ) .",
    "we calculate this current star formation rate based on the @xmath61-band flux using the conversion from @xcite . for comparison",
    ", we also calculated the star formation rates based on the h@xmath18 emission line flux in the sdss spectra ( detected for most of our galaxies ) , but found that the resulting rates suffered from the uncertainty of extrapolating the h@xmath18 flux from the @xmath62 sdss fiber aperture .",
    "we normalize the total star formation rate by the area over which star formation is occurring in order to remove any size - dependent variations within our sample .",
    "the median total star formation rate per unit area based on the @xmath61-band for our sample is @xmath63yr@xmath64 ; these rates are comparable to previous studies of gas - rich galaxies in this luminosity range @xcite . the star formation rates per unit area are shown in the bottom left of figure  [ fig_sfr ] and are not correlated with gas fraction .",
    "the gas fraction is better correlated with the time - averaged star - formation rate over the last billion years ( @xmath60 color ) than with the recent star - formation rate in the last few million years .",
    "this implies that the star formation rates we are observing now are different than those in the recent past ; the star formation rates appear to be stochastic .",
    "we attempt to quantify the stochastic nature of star formation in our sample by calculating the stellar birthrate timescale . in the left panel of figure  [ fig_hi ]",
    ", we plot the observed stellar mass divided by the current star formation rate ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "if the current rate of star formation has been constant over the lifetime of a galaxy , this quantity would represent the time needed to form its observed stellar component . for our sample ,",
    "the median timescale to make stars is 15gyrs with a nearly symmetric scatter to both shorter and longer timescales .",
    "observations of the color - magnitude diagrams of dwarf galaxies in the local group suggest that all dwarfs have an ancient stellar population component @xcite .",
    "if we assume all the galaxies in our sample formed at early times ( 10 - 12gyr ) , this implies that roughly half the sample had lower star formation rates and half had higher rates in the past than presently observed .",
    "this line of argument again suggests that star formation in dwarfs fluctuates and that the current star formation rate is not necessarily representative of the time - averaged rate . in the right panel of figure  [ fig_hi ]",
    "we also investigate the future of star formation by plotting the gas consumption timescale ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "in this plot we have not included gas - recycling , which would increase the gas consumption timescales .",
    "the majority of galaxies in this sample will be able to make stars , and therefore consume gas , at their present rates for another hubble time .",
    "the strongest observed trend in our sample is that between the gas fraction and @xmath60 color ( figure  [ fig_sfr ] , top left panel ) .",
    "this trend may be due to either internal or external processes .",
    "for example , a galaxy may use up its gas by forming stars and thus have redder colors due to a lower star formation rate compared to the recent past . alternatively",
    ", a galaxy s gas could be removed in denser environments and appear redder due to quenching of its star formation .",
    "since we have quantified the environment of each galaxy ( see  [ ssec_environ ] ) , we are able to test whether this and other trends are due internal or external processes .",
    "the top right panel of figure  [ fig_sfr ] suggests that both internal and external processes are important in controlling the trend between gas fraction and color . for gas - rich galaxies in our sample , with @xmath67 , the gas fractions are uncorrelated with nearest neighbor distance .",
    "in contrast , galaxies with low gas fractions ( @xmath68 ) are preferentially found within 0.5mpc of a luminous neighbor galaxy .",
    "thus , it appears that some reduction in the gas fraction is related to internal processes such as normal star - formation , `` primordial '' removal of gas at reionization , or outflows , however , only environmental effects are very effective at removing all of the gas from a dwarf galaxy .",
    "this is further supported by the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig_sfr ] . while red galaxies only exist near luminous neighbors , the colors of the blue sequence galaxies",
    "do not depend on distance to the nearest neighbor .",
    "this result is similar to the relationship between color and environment , or morphology and environment , seen in more luminous galaxies ( e.g. in @xcite ) , and the dwarf galaxy population of the local group @xcite .",
    "we conclude that while internal processes are able to reduce the gas fractions to @xmath69 , external processes are require to lower the gas fractions ( via removal of gas as suggested below via residuals in the tully - fisher relation ) further .",
    "the tully - fisher relationship relates the mass of a galaxy as inferred from its luminous component to its dynamical mass , as measured by the maximum rotational velocity .",
    "the tight coupling between these components has greatly informed our understanding of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies with rotation velocities less than 90 km  s@xmath5  tend to fall below the optical tully - fisher relationship established by massive galaxies in the sense that the ratio of stellar to dynamical mass is lower for the dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this `` break '' has sometimes been interpreted as evidence that dwarf galaxies have preferentially lost baryonic mass due to _ e.g. _  supernovae winds @xcite .",
    "@xcite first noted that this break is removed when both the stellar and gaseous components are taken into account .",
    "this baryonic tully - fisher relationship has been investigated by many groups @xcite .",
    "understanding the baryonic tully - fisher relation for low mass galaxies should place tight constraints on the role of ram pressure stripping , tidal stripping , feedback , galactic winds , photoevaporation during reionization in the evolution of dwarf galaxies .    in figures",
    "[ fig_tf ] and  [ fig_tflit ] , we explore the tully - fisher relationship within our dwarf galaxy sample .",
    "we estimate the maximum rotational velocities for our galaxies based on the inclination- and turbulence - corrected hi profile half - width ( w20@xmath70/2 ) .",
    "while we will present resolved optical h@xmath18 rotation curves for this sample in a forthcoming paper , the hi line - widths are a more reliable measure of the maximum rotation velocity in these low mass systems .",
    "this is because the optical rotation curves of low mass galaxies rarely show a velocity turnover at the last optically measured data point @xcite , leading to an underestimate of the true maximum rotation velocity .",
    "resolved hi rotation curves also do not always show a velocity turnover @xcite , however the hi tends to extend 2 - 3 times beyond the observed optical radii @xcite and thus is a more reliable probe of the true maximum rotation velocity .",
    "the dwarf galaxies in our sample have a significant rotation component ( figure  [ fig_imgprof ] ) .",
    "we correct the observed hi line - widths for line broadening due to turbulent velocity dispersion and inclination using the formula first proposed by @xcite : @xmath71 where w20 is the observed hi line - width , w20@xmath72 is the turbulent velocity correction term and @xmath50 is the inclination angle inferred from the optical images .",
    "we confirm the validity of a linear turbulence correction based on modeling the integrated velocity profiles of simulated galaxies constructed from @xcite model disk galaxies . for nearby dwarf galaxies with rotation velocities similar to our sample , @xcite have measured velocity dispersion in the gas component of @xmath73 km  s@xmath5 based on the average line - of - sight velocity dispersion measured from 2d velocity maps .",
    "using the begum et al .",
    "value , this results in a turbulence correction of w20@xmath74 km  s@xmath5 , which we use here . altering this turbulence correction ( say to 25 km  s@xmath5 ) does not change our results below .    using the approach of @xcite",
    ", we infer @xmath75 from the @xmath76 axis ratio based on two - dimensional srsic  fitting of the @xmath39-band sdss images .",
    "in particular , we assume the disks to be intrinsically oblate and axisymmetric , with a three - dimensional axis ratio of @xmath77 , and take : @xmath78 with @xmath79 . again , changing the particular value of @xmath77 ( say to 0.3 ) again does not change our results significantly .",
    "figure  [ fig_tf ] shows the stellar , hi and baryonic tully - fisher relationships for our dwarf galaxy sample . in the three panels of this figure , we linearly regress to fit a function of the form : @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the fitted intercept and slope of the tully - fisher relationship , respectively .",
    "these fits are regressions with mass as the independent variable . table [",
    "tffit_table ] lists their values and uncertainties ( calculated from bootstrap resampling ) .",
    "in addition , we calculate the correlation coefficient @xmath39 between each pair of variables , listed in each panel of figure [ fig_tf ] .",
    "the correlation coefficient is zero for two unrelated quantities and unity for two perfectly linearly related quantities ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar tully - fisher ( figure  [ fig_tf ] , right panel ) has significantly more scatter than the either the hi or total baryonic relationships ( figure  [ fig_tf ] , middle and left panels ) .",
    "the stellar relation has a much lower correlation coefficient ( @xmath83 versus @xmath84 ) and considerably more scatter about the best fit regression line , as listed in table [ tffit_table ] ( about 50% scatter compared to about 30% scatter ) , than do the hi mass or baryonic mass tf relationships .",
    "this result is perhaps not surprising : at low luminosities , stars contribute far less to the total baryonic mass compared to massive galaxies ( figure  [ fig_gas ] ) .",
    "thus , for dwarf galaxies of the same total mass , the amount of gas turned into stars varies between systems .",
    "while the scatter in the baryonic tully - fisher relationship is much smaller compared to the stellar relationship , it does have more scatter than accounted for by our observational error bars .",
    "the fitted slope is unchanged if we restrict our sample to only galaxies whose inclination corrections are small ( @xmath85 ) or if we alter our assumptions about turbulence or the intrinsic axis - ratio .    in figure  [ fig_tflit ]",
    ", we compare our dwarf galaxy sample to tully - fisher data available in the literature .",
    "we compare only to literature samples for which hi and optical measurements are available : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for the literature datasets , we recalculate distances based on @xmath86mpc km  s@xmath5  and a model of the local velocity field @xcite ( for galaxies with recession velocities less than 6000 km  s@xmath5 ) . for the @xcite data , we assume a constant color of @xmath87 .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig_tflit ] we plot the optical tully - fisher relationship in the @xmath88-band . @xcite",
    "first noted that low mass dwarf galaxies fall well below the optical tully - fisher ( tf ) relationship as defined by luminous spiral galaxies in the sense that , for a given rotation velocity , the dwarfs are optically under - luminous compared to the expected tf value .",
    "@xcite  also noted that these same galaxies lie on the same relation defined by luminous galaxies in the baryonic tf relationship ( figure  [ fig_tflit ] , right panel ) .",
    "again , this is not surprising : we have shown above that dwarf galaxies have high gas fractions and the optical luminosity / stellar mass is often only a few percent of the total baryonic mass . however , unlike @xcite , we do not see evidence for a distinct break in slope of the optical tf occurring at 90 km  s@xmath5 . at low luminosities ,",
    "the scatter around the optical tf relation does increase considerably , but not preferentially to high or low velocities .",
    "that a single linear fit adequately describes the baryonic tf data over more than three decades of mass is significant .",
    "many authors have suggested that supernovae - driven winds will preferentially remove baryonic material from galaxies with @xmath89 km s@xmath5 due to their far smaller gravitational potentials compared to luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_tflit ] suggests that a critical mass threshold does not exist below which mass - ejection is efficient down to baryonic masses of @xmath90  and rotational velocities of as low as 20 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "if a critical threshold existed , we would have expected to see a break in the baryonic tully - fisher .",
    "while it might be possible to explain this single relationship via a baryonic mass - loss rate which varies smoothly with mass , the measured slope of this relation suggests that this is not the case . from the virial theorem ,",
    "the expected slope of the baryonic tf is @xmath91 .",
    "the predicted slope from cosmological simulations is @xmath92 , or as more commonly quoted @xmath93 @xcite , in good agreement with our value of @xmath94 , or @xmath95 .",
    "thus , we interpret the baryonic tf relationship shown in figure  [ fig_tflit ] as evidence that dwarf galaxies do not preferentially lose significant baryonic mass compared to luminous galaxies .    finally , we consider the residuals from the tf relationship .",
    "we define these residuals in terms of the ratio @xmath96 , the corrected observed hi line - width divided by that expected from the fitted linear baryonic tully - fisher relationship .",
    "this quantity is defined in the sense that larger @xmath96 values correspond to lower inferred baryon - to - dark matter ratios .",
    "figure [ fig_resid ] shows this quantity as a function of projected nearest neighbor distance , color , gas fraction and axis ratio @xmath76 .",
    "we find no correlation between these residuals and the axis - ratio @xmath76 , except that the very flat galaxies ( @xmath97 ) never exhibit low @xmath96 ratios ( figure  [ fig_resid ] , bottom left panel ) . that no strong trend exists with axis - ratio suggests that the measured hi line - widths are properly sampling the galactic potential .",
    "dwarf galaxies with low gas fractions have low @xmath96 ratios .",
    "this suggests that low gas fraction dwarf galaxies , which are preferentially found in dense environments , have _ higher _ baryon - to - dark matter ratios compared to the majority of dwarfs in our sample .",
    "if , for example , reduced gas fractions in dense environments were due to interaction - induced star formation , we would expect these ratios to remain constant .",
    "if this were due to ram pressure stripping alone one might expect this ratio to be lower in dense environments : gas stripping would preferentially remove baryonic mass , reducing the ratio of baryons to dark matter .",
    "there is little correlation with color , indicating that if gas stripping is important , it is not directly effecting to the star - formation rates at the center .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that this is simply a selection effect and the hi line - widths do not properly sample the galactic potentials of the lowest gas fraction galaxies . as the number of observed galaxies in this mass range increase , the tf residuals should place significant constraints on galaxy evolution processes important at these masses .",
    "we present results from an hi survey of low luminosity dwarf galaxies in the absolute magnitude range @xmath98 selected from the sdss .",
    "these data represent the largest homogeneous sample of low luminosity dwarf galaxies with well - measured hi and optical properties .",
    "the sample spans a range of total baryonic masses between m@xmath99with measured hi line - widths between @xmath100w@xmath101 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the dwarf galaxies in this sample are found in a wide range of environments , from dense groups to truly isolated galaxies .    for the majority of our dwarf galaxy sample ,",
    "the total galactic baryonic mass is dominated by the gas mass rather than stellar mass .",
    "the average gas fraction for our sample is @xmath1020.6 , with gas fractions as high as 95% .",
    "this significantly exceeds that of gas - rich galaxies at higher luminosities .",
    "thus , dwarf galaxies are inefficient at turning gas into stars compared to more luminous galaxies .",
    "we find that gas - rich galaxies have bluer @xmath60 colors compared to gas - poor objects implying that gas - rich dwarf galaxies have had more recent star formation .",
    "the majority of galaxies in our sample are currently forming stars based on observed h@xmath18 emission in the sdss spectra .",
    "we find that the _ current _ rate of star formation per unit area ( based on the total @xmath61-band flux ) is not correlated with gas fraction , confirming previous results suggesting that the star formation rates in dwarf galaxies are stochastic @xcite .",
    "thus , dwarf galaxies form stars with a rate that varies over million year time scales , but is correlated with the gas fraction over longer time periods .    using the range of environments within our sample",
    ", we examine whether internal or external processes control the gas fractions of dwarf galaxies .",
    "trends between galaxy properties , such as color or morphology , and environment have been well studied for galaxies at brighter luminosities @xcite , but have been previously limited to the local group and nearby groups at dwarf luminosities @xcite .",
    "our sample allows us to quantify these trends for dwarf galaxies over a much wider range of environments .",
    "we find that dwarf galaxies with gas fractions @xmath103 , comprising @xmath104 of this sample , are exclusively found within 0.5mpc of a luminous neighbor galaxy .",
    "galaxies with gas fractions @xmath67 are found across the full range of environments contained within this sample .",
    "thus , while internal galaxies processes can reduce the gas fractions , external processes are required to fully remove gas from a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the optical tully - fisher relationship within our dwarf galaxy sample demonstrates considerable scatter .",
    "as previous work has shown for brighter samples ( @xcite ) , the baryonic tully - fisher relationship within our sample is much tighter .",
    "when we consider the tully  fisher relationship across all absolute magnitudes , we find a logarithmic slope of @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 ) .",
    "these results are in accord with cdm predictions of @xmath93 assuming no preferential loss of baryons as a function of mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our results suggest that processes which preferentially remove gas from dwarf galaxies are not important for the majority of galaxies in our sample with maximum rotation velocities @xmath107",
    "km  s@xmath5  ( roughly corresponding to total dynamical masses of m@xmath108 ) .    if galaxies are associated one - to - one with @xmath7cdm dark matter halos , the mass - to - light ratios of galaxies must decline as a function of host halo mass @xcite .",
    "the most well - known example of this problem is the local group `` substructure problem '' @xcite . to explain this trend in mass - to - light ratio",
    ", investigators often invoke processes such as ram pressure stripping or supernova feedback that either removes gas or heats it sufficiently to prevent star - formation in low mass galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most semi - analytic models require significant baryonic mass loss @xcite , predicting baryon - to - dark matter ratios for dwarf galaxies well below the `` universal '' baryon fraction @xcite .",
    "comparing the metallicity of galaxies over a wide range of baryonic masses , @xcite found that dwarfs are metal depleted relative to massive galaxies and argue in favor of galactic winds efficiently removing enriched material from low mass galaxies .",
    "however , at the masses of the galaxies in our sample , detailed models of the physics of gas blow - out and blow - away tend to disfavor significant gas mass loss , predicting loss of only a few percent @xcite .",
    "our sample can not rule out small amounts baryon mass loss from these galaxies , nor scenarios in which gas remains bound to the galaxy but is blown away from the region participating in star formation .",
    "this may explain the low observed metallicities of dwarf galaxies  enriched gas is removed from regions of active star formation , resulting in low observed metallicities , but either remains bound or represents only a few percent of the total baryonic mass .",
    "indeed , recent cosmological simulations which include realistic feedback and chemical evolution suggest that the metallicity , mass - to - light ratios and other galaxies properties can be explained without including supernova energy feedback @xcite .",
    "our results favor such dwarf galaxy formation models in which processes such as supernovae winds are not responsible for significant gas or baryon mass in low mass galaxies .",
