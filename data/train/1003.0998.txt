    "in recent times major advances in the experimental techniques have led to the realization of experiments in which quantum systems in a single particle regime are studied under their controlled interaction with some environment . a paradigmatic example in this context",
    "is given by the motion of a massive test particle in an interferometric setup , which gives rise to interference fringes as typical quantum signatures .",
    "when the coupling with the environment becomes of relevance , such interference fringes are gradually washed out , and a classical dynamics is eventually recovered .",
    "this phenomenon goes under the name of decoherence @xcite .",
    "its understanding and theoretical description require on the one hand a control over the environment , on the other hand a microscopic model for the interaction and the ensuing dynamics .    for the case of a tracer particle immersed in a dilute gas",
    "such a microscopic description has been obtained considering the centre of mass degrees of freedom only .",
    "the reduced dynamics is given by a master equation in lindblad form which has been called quantum linear boltzmann equation , since it provides the natural quantum counterpart of the classical linear boltzmann equation ( see @xcite for a recent review and references therein ) .",
    "the microscopic input is given by the complex scattering amplitudes describing the collisions between gas and test particle , while the gas is characterized by its density and momentum distribution .",
    "in this paper we consider an extension of this result , which includes internal degrees of freedom of the tracer particle .",
    "the microscopic derivation is performed along the lines of a general strategy for the derivation of markovian master equations , which relies on a scattering description of the interaction events @xcite . besides the gas properties",
    ", this approach takes as basic input the multichannel complex scattering amplitudes , which describe the influence of the internal states on the scattering events .",
    "indeed , when the scattering cross section does not only depend on the relative motional state between tracer and gas particle , such an extension becomes mandatory in order to correctly describe the dynamics . according to the markovian approximation ,",
    "the obtained master equation is in lindblad form .",
    "this derivation confirms the structure of the dissipative term , which has been heuristically obtained in @xcite , further determining the coherent contribution to the dynamics due to forward scattering .",
    "the latter becomes relevant in the determination of the index of refraction for matter waves .",
    "when either type of degrees of freedom can be described in classical terms , a markovian quantum classical master equation is obtained .",
    "such a result , corresponding to a classical treatment of the motional degrees of freedom , has been considered in @xcite . in that context",
    "the name bloch - boltzmann equation was proposed for the equation , since for a two - level system an extension of the optical bloch equations to include a boltzmann - like collision term is obtained . in the same spirit ,",
    "the name quantum bloch - boltzmann equation can be used to indicate a master equation , which gives a quantum description of both internal and centre of mass state .",
    "an interesting situation appears when in the final detection the internal state of the test particle is not resolved at the output of the interferometer . in this case",
    "the internal degrees of freedom become part of the environment . then a non - markovian dynamics for the motional state appears , which can be described in terms of a coupled set of lindblad equations for the unnormalized statistical operators corresponding to specific internal channels .",
    "this type of non - markovian dynamics can be considered as a generalized non - markovian lindblad structure .",
    "it arises as a mean over a classical index , which can take place e.g. as a consequence of the interaction with a structured reservoir @xcite .",
    "this situation is here considered in the study of the loss of visibility of the interference fringes in an interferometric setup .",
    "the ensuing decoherence effect is generally not described as an exponential loss of visibility depending on the strength of the interaction , as in the usual markovian case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ms ] we consider the expression of the master equation , pointing to the main steps necessary for its derivation and putting into evidence the microscopic quantities determining its explicit form .",
    "a detailed microscopic derivation of the master equation is performed in appendix  [ sec : micr - deriv - mast ] .",
    "the master equation is given both in terms of matrix elements of the statistical operator in the momentum and internal energy eigenstates basis , as well as an explicit operator expression , which makes its lindblad structure manifest .",
    "this also allows to easily recover under suitable limits previously considered master equations , which describe either only one of the two kind of degrees of freedom or a hybrid quantum classical description of both . in sect .",
    "[ sec : decoh ] we show how the interplay between internal and motional states can influence the visibility in an interferometric setup for the study of decoherence , leading to a non - markovian behaviour in the reduction of the visibility of the interference fringes .",
    "we first consider the key ingredients and steps which lead to obtain the master equation describing the collisional dynamics of a test particle immersed in a structureless background gas , keeping the internal degrees of freedom of the particle into account .",
    "the task of a full microscopic derivation will be accomplished in appendix  [ sec : micr - deriv - mast ] , relying on a method recently introduced for the derivation of markovian master equations , which has been called monitoring approach @xcite . in the monitoring approach the reduced dynamics of a system in contact with some environment",
    "is obtained describing their interaction by means of scattering theory .",
    "the building blocks in such a formulation of the open system dynamics are therefore the s - matrix characterizing the single interaction events and the rate of collisions .",
    "both quantities are given by operators on the tensor product hilbert space of system and environment , which we shall denote by @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the operator nature of these quantities is crucial in order to keep the gas and test particle state into account in the dynamic description of the collisional interaction .",
    "the markovian master equation for the reduced dynamics is obtained by assuming the various collisions as independent , so that their effect cumulates according to the state dependent scattering rate , and taking the trace over the environmental degrees of freedom .",

    "indeed this step involves further approximations , which depend in a crucial way on details of system and interaction .",
    "it is well known that by taking the partial trace with respect to the unitary evolution of the overall system one can obtain a markovian dynamics only if further hypotheses hold .",
    "this remains true for the case at hand , despite the fact that important approximations have already been introduced in replacing the hamiltonian dynamics for system plus gas with a lindblad operator only specified by @xmath15 and @xmath1 . the actual proof that a markovian dynamics applies to the situation of interest and the specific expression of the superoperators appearing in eq .",
