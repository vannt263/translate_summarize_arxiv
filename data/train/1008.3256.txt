    "hopping problems on certain frustrated lattices have the unusual feature that some of their energy bands are dispersionless .",
    "systems of this kind have been studied in several different contexts , including both itinerant ferromagnetism within the hubbard model @xcite and frustrated antiferromagnetism within the heisenberg model .",
    "@xcite in the first of these examples , the divergent density of states for a flat band stabilises ferromagnetic order by ensuring that the stoner criterion is satisfied . in the second example , the existence of a flat band in the hopping problem is closely linked to macroscopic ground state degeneracy in a classical antiferromagnet defined on the same lattice .",
    "the degeneracy of states in dispersionless bands is easily lifted by perturbations . in this paper",
    "we examine the effect of one such perturbation : a weak random potential . for a flat band of the clean lattice ,",
    "weak disorder sets the only energy scale and controls the localisation properties of eigenstates .",
    "previous work in this area , @xcite while identifying the weak - disorder limit as interesting , has focussed mainly on anderson transitions occuring at finite disorder strength .",
    "we expect transitions occurring at finite disorder strength to be in the same universality class as those on unfrustrated lattices , and anticipate that special features of flat - band localisation occur only in the weak - disorder limit .",
    "the weak - disorder flat - band localisation problem shares an obvious feature with the one of anderson localisation in integer quantum hall systems , in the sense that a landau level can be viewed as a continuum analogue of a flat band . for a landau level , a property of the projection operator onto the level ",
    "its non - zero chern number  ensures that disorder can not localise all states.@xcite remarkably , we find for frustrated hopping problems that localisation is also controlled by a feature of the projection operator onto the flat band . in the cases we are concerned with , its matrix elements in real space decay as a power law of separation , and this power is equal to the spatial dimension . as a consequence ,",
    "a random potential projected onto the flat band gives rise to a localisation problem similar to one in which the magnitude of hopping matrix elements between distant sites decreases as a power of their separation .",
    "a system of this kind is known to be critical when the power is the same as the spatial dimension , @xcite and the one - dimensional case of power - law banded random matrices has been studied extensively.@xcite on these grounds , we expect eigenstates in frustrated tight binding models with weak disorder to be critical , and we use a numerical study of their multifractal properties to demonstrate this for a two - dimensional example .",
    "separately , we show that the flat - band localisation problem can be mapped onto the problem of resonances occurring in random impedance networks , for which eigenfunctions have also been found to be critical in an earlier numerical study.@xcite    while our exclusive focus here is on flat - band localisation , this problem has close links to a number of other topics of current interest .",
    "the most direct connection is to a geometrically frustrated antiferromagnet that has its spins polarised by a strong applied field : its single spin - flip excitations are described by a frustrated hopping hamiltonian,@xcite and in the presence of weak disorder may exhibit the features we discuss in this paper ( although the form of disorder we treat is site - diagonal , while randomness in the strength of exchange interactions would appear as off - diagonal disorder ) . more generally , the mathematics of flat bands is closely linked to the physics of coulomb phases @xcite in classical statistical mechanical systems  notably dimer models @xcite and frustrated magnets.@xcite there has recently been a general effort to understand transitions out of the coulomb phase , induced by perturbations .",
    "@xcite in particular , flat - band localisation can be viewed as a linearised version of the transition induced by weak disorder in a frustrated magnet , between the coulomb phase and spin glass order.@xcite finally , we note recent studies of bose condensation in flat bands@xcite and of the combined effects of disorder and interactions in the falicov - kimball model on a lattice with a flat band.@xcite    in section [ models ] we define the models we consider , discuss projection onto the flat band and set out a mapping between the flat - band localisation problem and random impedance networks , while in section [ simulations ] we present results from simulations .",
    "several parallel terminologies have been used to describe the tight - binding models we study here , which all involve a single non - zero hopping energy @xmath0 between nearby sites labelled @xmath1 at positions @xmath2 on a periodic lattice in @xmath3 dimensions . in informal terms , for each model the sites can be grouped into clusters , labelled @xmath4 , in such a way that : @xmath5 each site is shared between two clusters ; @xmath6 every pair of sites belonging to a given cluster is linked by hopping ; and @xmath7 there is no hopping between sites from different clusters . a second lattice appears naturally from this construction : it has its sites located at the centers of the clusters of the first lattice , and the sites of the first lattice lie at the mid - points of bonds of the second lattice . as described by mielke @xcite using the language of graph theory ,",
    "if the second lattice is denoted by the graph @xmath8 with vertices @xmath9 and edges @xmath10 , then the first lattice is the line graph @xmath11 of @xmath12 , which has as its vertex set @xmath13 the edge set @xmath10 of @xmath12 , and has edges @xmath14 between two vertices in @xmath13 if and only if the corresponding edges in @xmath12 share a vertex .",
    "our study is hence of tight binding models on line graphs .",
    "alternatively , @xmath12 is known as the simplex lattice@xcite or parent lattice @xcite and @xmath11 is called its medial lattice .",
    "one distinction within this class is important to us : for reasons indicated below , we restrict ourselves to simplex lattices that are bipartite and expect different behaviour in the opposite case .",
    "we note that some rather more general classes of tight binding models with flat bands have also been considered , @xcite which we do not examine here .",
    "a two - dimensional example of the class of lattices which we are interested in is the square lattice with crossings , also called the planar pyrochlore lattice , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for this",
    "the simplex lattice is a square lattice .",
    "a second two - dimensional example is the kagome lattice , @xcite which has the hexagonal lattice as its simplex lattice .",
    "a three - dimensional case is the pyrochlore lattice,@xcite with the diamond lattice as its simplex lattice ; another is the octahedral lattice , @xcite with the simple cubic lattice as its simplex lattice .    when specifying the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath15 for the clean system it is convenient to include a constant term , chosen so that the flat bands are located at energy zero .",
    "the hamiltonian then has elements @xmath16 & \\,i , j \\in { \\rm same\\ , cluster}\\\\ 0 & { \\rm otherwise\\ , . }",
    "\\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{ham1}\\ ] ] its expectation value in a state with amplitudes @xmath17 can conveniently be written in the form @xmath18 taking @xmath19 , it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) that the eigenvalues of @xmath15 are non - negative .",
    "it is also evident that states having @xmath20 for all @xmath21 and @xmath22 are eigenstates with energy zero .",
    "such states can be constructed on the lattices we study by taking @xmath23 with alternating signs on a closed loop of neighbouring sites that includes exactly two sites from every cluster visited by the loop , and setting @xmath24 at sites not lying on the loop .",
    "( the construction with alternating signs requires the closed loop to have even length . since the loop can be viewed as a walk on the simplex lattice , this property is guaranteed provided the simplex lattice is bipartite , but not otherwise . )",
    "these loops can be chosen to be finite and short : for example , as squares on the planar pyrochlore lattice or as hexagons on the kagome lattice . translated copies of such eigenstates",
    "form a band of zero - energy states , which is the flat band we are concerned with .    in",
    "what follows , properties of the projection operator @xmath25 onto the zero - energy states play an important role . when a band is separated by energy gaps from other bands , the real - space matrix elements @xmath26 decay exponentially at long distances as a function of separation @xmath27 between sites.@xcite however , for models in the class we have defined ( here it is again crucial that the simplex lattice be bipartite ) , the zero - energy band touches a dispersive band at one or more points in the brillouin zone @xcite and @xmath26 decays more slowly with separation . for any specific lattice",
    "its form can be computed explicitly from the eigenvectors of @xmath15 , but to see the generic long - distance properties it is better to move to a continuum treatment . to this end ,",
    "following discussions of the coulomb phase in dimer models @xcite and antiferromagnets , @xcite we first introduce real space unit vectors @xmath28 aligned along each bond @xmath1 of the simplex lattice , and all directed from one sublattice ( chosen as a matter of convention ) towards the other .",
    "then we associate a @xmath3-component vector field @xmath29 with a set of amplitudes @xmath17 , by defining @xmath30 the zero energy condition , eq .",
    "( [ zero - energy ] ) , is also the condition that the field @xmath29 has zero lattice divergence at every site of the simplex lattice . to understand the long - distance behaviour of @xmath25",
    ", we therefore consider the projection operator onto divergenceless fields that are functions of a continuous position variable @xmath31 .",
    "the reciprocal space form of @xmath25 is block - diagonal in wavevector @xmath32 . on the lattice",
    "the blocks act on the space of sites within a unit cell , while in the continuum they are @xmath33 matrices acting on the components of @xmath34 , with the form @xmath35 in real space this yields @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a dimension - dependent constant .",
    "as advertised , the projection operator falls off as @xmath38 in @xmath3-dimensions .",
    "returning to the tight - binding model , we introduce disorder as a site - diagonal random potential with matrix elements @xmath39 the @xmath40 are independent , identically distributed random variables having zero mean and unit variance .",
    "combining ingredients , the localisation problem we study has the hamiltonian @xmath41 and we are interested in the weak disorder limit , obtained by taking @xmath42 .",
    "consider for @xmath43 the density of states in energy @xmath10 when @xmath44 .",
    "at @xmath45 it is similar to that of @xmath15 , but for @xmath46 it is dominated by the contribution from the disorder - broadened flat band , which has energy width @xmath47 .",
    "we wish to understand simplifications at large @xmath0 in the eigenvectors of @xmath43 belonging to this band .",
    "let @xmath48 be such an eigenvector , which we have separated into components that obey @xmath49 and @xmath50 and lie respectively within and perpendicular to the space spanned by the flat bands of the clean system .",
    "because @xmath51 , the eigenvalue equation @xmath52 implies @xmath53 since we expect @xmath54 , we require @xmath55 to ensure that @xmath56 when @xmath0 is large . at leading order , eq .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) therefore simplifies to @xmath57    to make a connection with random impedance networks , note that @xmath25 and @xmath58 effect a lattice version of the helmholtz decomposition : @xmath59 projects onto lattice fields that are solenoidal , while @xmath60 projects onto lattice fields that are irrotational . in consequence",
    ", @xmath61 can be expressed as the lattice gradient of a potential defined at the sites of the simplex lattice .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath62 be the simplex lattice sites linked by the simplex lattice bond @xmath1 , with @xmath28 directed from @xmath21 to @xmath62 .",
    "then there exist simplex site potentials @xmath63 such that for every @xmath1 @xmath64 in addition @xmath65 and so with @xmath66 we have @xmath67 now eq .  ( [ zero - energy ] ) implies for every @xmath21 that @xmath68 where the sum on @xmath62 is over simplex lattice sites that are nearest neighbours to @xmath21 .",
    "( [ potential ] ) is also the equation that describes resonances in an impedance network.@xcite it has non - trivial solutions for @xmath63 only if @xmath10 is an eigenvalue of @xmath43 . in the impedance network interpretation , it is kirchoff s law for current conservation at node @xmath21 of the network , @xmath63 is the voltage at that node , and @xmath69 is the complex conductance , or inverse impedance , between nodes @xmath21 and @xmath62 .",
    "this impedance is frequency - dependent and the equation has non - trivial solutions at the resonant frequencies , which are real if the network is loss - free .",
    "such resonances have been studied for a binary distribution of impedances on the square lattice by jonckheere and luck.@xcite in particular , these authors find from numerical calculations that the electric fields associated with resonant states , which correspond in our notation to the combination @xmath70 , have a multifractal distribution .",
    "their conclusion is entirely consistent with our view of flat - band localisation , as being automatically critical because @xmath25 is long range .",
    "moreover , this connection to flat - band localisation provides an explanation of why resonant states should generically be critical for an impedance network in any number of dimensions .",
    "to illustrate these ideas and study the approach to the large @xmath0 limit , we have calculated eigenfunctions and eigenvectors for @xmath43 on the planar pyrochlore lattice of fig .",
    "we take the site potentials @xmath40 from a gaussian distribution and examine values of @xmath0 up to @xmath71 .",
    "we diagonalise @xmath72 for square systems with periodic boundary conditions and side length @xmath73 in the range @xmath74 , in units of the nearest neighbour spacing .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath75 of spacings @xmath76 between adjacent eigenvalues , measured in units of the mean spacing , is a standard diagnostic for localisation transitions.@xcite metallic and localised phases are identified by wigner - dyson and poisson distributions@xcite respectively , while the critical point is characterised by a distinct , universal distribution.@xcite we present in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] our results for @xmath75 .",
    "these were obtained using states from the central half of the flat band , and applying standard band - unfolding methods to compensate for the energy dependence of the average density of states .",
    "the data shown were calculated using @xmath77 but results are essentially the same for any @xmath78 . within the statistical precision of the data ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath75 is independent of system size .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that the form of @xmath75 is intermediate between those for wigner - dyson and poisson distributions , as expected in a system at a critical point .    to probe the nature of eigenfunctions",
    "we have examined the scaling with system size of averaged moments of the probability density .",
    "more specifically , eigenfunction fluctuations can be characterised by a set of generalised fractal dimensions @xcite if disorder - averaged moments have the power - law dependence @xmath79_{\\rm av }   = a_q l^{-\\tau(q)}\\,\\ ] ] on system size , where @xmath80 is related to the fractal dimension by @xmath81 and @xmath82 is a constant .",
    "for uniformly extended states @xmath83 and for localised states @xmath84 , but for critical states a non - trivial dependence of @xmath85 on @xmath86 is expected . as is standard ,",
    "@xcite we analyse multifractality via the spectrum of singularity strengths @xmath87 , which is related to @xmath80 by a legendre transformation : @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "it has the interpretation that @xmath90 is the measure of the set of points @xmath1 at which the probability density in an eigenstate scales with system size as @xmath91 .",
    "we determine @xmath87 using the procedure described in ref .  .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the upper panel of this figure displays the size - dependence of our estimates for @xmath87 at finite @xmath73 , showing convergence to the large-@xmath73 limit .",
    "the lower panel demonstrates that the form of @xmath87 that results at large @xmath73 is @xmath0-independent provided @xmath0 is large.@xcite these final , large-@xmath73 , large-@xmath0 data are well - fitted by the parabola @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "correspondingly , we find @xmath95 .",
    "fractal properties in generalized random matrix ensembles depend on details of the model@xcite ( for example , on disorder strength in power law random banded matrices@xcite ) .",
    "similarly , we expect fractal properties in weak - disorder flat - band localisation to vary with the choice of distribution for @xmath40 , but we have not explored that aspect .    in summary ,",
    "these numerical results support our expectation that weak disorder in a tight binding model with flat bands should give rise to eigenstates that are critical , in the sense of the anderson localisation transition .",
    "strictly , we do not expect the limits @xmath96 and @xmath97 to commute : at fixed @xmath0 there should be a crossover at sufficiently large @xmath73 to a conventional localisation problem .",
    "our results indicate that the scale at which this happens must be very large when @xmath0 is large .",
    "we therefore believe that our determination of @xmath87 is unaffected by the crossover ."
