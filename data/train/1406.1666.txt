    "the @xmath0-mode signal in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provides important information about the primordial inflation responsible for the generation of the cosmic density fluctuations . in particular , since the gravitational waves ( gws ) produced during inflation is likely to be the origin of the @xmath0-mode signal , the amplitude of the inflationary gravitational waves ( igws ) , at least for the scale relevant for the cmb , will be understood once the @xmath0-mode signal is observed .",
    "recently the discovery of the @xmath0-mode signal has been announced by bicep2 @xcite and the reported tensor - to - scalar ratio is relatively large ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) : such a value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio is consistent with the prediction of so - called large - field inflation like chaotic inflation @xcite .",
    "however , after the announcement of the bicep2 result , it was pointed out that the bicep2 signal may be significantly affected by the polarized dust emission @xcite .",
    "even in such a case , some fraction of the signal could originate from igws and hence a relatively large igw amplitude may still be allowed .",
    "the large value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio opens up a new possibility to detect and study the properties of the igws by direct detection experiments in the future @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to consider to what extent we can obtain the information on the inflationary dynamics from future direct - detection experiments of gws . for future prospects of probing gravitational waves using @xmath0-mode in light of the bicep2 result ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "importantly , the information about the dynamics of inflation is imprinted in the igws . in particular , the spectral index and the running of the igw spectrum",
    "depend on how the inflaton evolves during inflation .",
    "this fact implies that the determination of these parameters from the igws may enable us to acquire the information about the shape of the inflaton potential@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the igw spectrum is also sensitive to the history of the universe so that the information about the cosmic expansion is embedded in it . in particular",
    ", the igw spectrum changes its behavior at the frequency corresponding to the time of the reheating due to the inflaton decay @xcite.for the works studying the thermal history with gws along this line , see @xcite .",
    "if the spectrum of the igws is precisely studied , we may acquire information about the very early epoch of the universe .",
    "the possibilities of detecting and studying the igws with future space - based gw detectors , like big bang observer ( bbo)@xcite and deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo ) @xcite , have been intensively studied .",
    "in particular , some of these detectors are expected to detect the igw signal if @xmath4 which is predicted by the chaotic inflation ( and also if there is no significant suppression of the igw amplitude at the frequency range of @xmath5 compared to that at the cmb scale ) .",
    "in fact , the sensitivities of these detectors are planned to be so high that they may not only detect the igws but also study their properties .",
    "notably , these space - based gw detectors are sensitive to the gws at the frequency of @xmath6 , which enters the horizon when the cosmic temperature is about @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we may have a chance to learn what happened in the universe at such a high temperature with those gw detectors .",
    "since there will be more data coming on the @xmath0-mode polarization of cmb in the near future from planck and other experiments , it would be now worth revisiting the question of what kind of information we may acquire with the future space - based gw detectors .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate how and how well we can study the properties of the igws with future gw experiments . for this purpose , assuming future space - based gw experiments , we calculate the signal - to - noise ratio for given fiducial models .",
    "the size of the signal is assumed to be the one predicted in the chaotic inflation , while the noise functions are estimated for several choices of detector parameters .",
    "we first consider the measurements of igw parameters for the case where the reheating temperature is so high that the igw spectrum in the sensitivity range of the gw detectors is insensitive to @xmath8 .",
    "we study how well we can measure the amplitude , the spectral index , and its running .",
    "then , we discuss the case where @xmath8 is relatively low .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : spectrum ]",
    ", we briefly review basic properties of the igw .",
    "the statistical method we adopt in this paper is summarized in section [ sec : stat ] .",
    "the numerical results are shown in section [ sec : determination ] . in section [ sec : test ] , we discuss the implication of the study of the igw spectrum on the test of inflation models .",
    "in particular , we discuss how the prediction of the chaotic inflation model can be tested .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted for conclusions and discussion .",
    "we first briefly review basic properties of the igws for the case where there is no entropy production after the decay of inflaton . for our analysis , it is convenient to define the present gw energy density per log frequency normalized by the critical density @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the frequency of the gws and @xmath12 is the total energy density of the igw integrated over frequency .",
    "the igw spectrum @xmath13 strongly depends on the reheating temperature after inflation . in our analysis , we evaluate the reheating temperature ashere , we assume the perturbative decay of the inflaton in the reheating process . if the parametric resonance occurs , eq .",
    "is modified ; in such a case , the reheating temperature is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the particle - production rate due to the parametric resonance at the end of the reheating process .",
    "since the effect of the parametric resonance is model - dependent , hereafter , we consider the case where reheating process proceeds via the perturbative decay of the inflaton .",

    "in addition , @xmath19 is the effective number of massless degrees of freedom at the temperature of @xmath20 ; we use the standard - model prediction of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 being the temperature at the time of radiation - matter equality ) .",
    "we denote the frequency of the mode entering the horizon at the time of the reheating as @xmath24 , which is approximately given by @xmath25    in the frequency range of our interest , @xmath13 is given by the following form : @xmath26 where the function @xmath27 contains information about the reheating temperature ; @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",

    "the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are expected to be much smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "we will discuss how well we can constrain these parameters with future space - based gw detectors .",
    "it should be noted that , because @xmath36 does not depend on the pivot scale , the following relations hold : @xmath37 where we neglect the contributions of higher - order expansion parameters .",
    "thus , the error in one parameter contaminates into those of other parameters if we change the pivot scale .",
    "in other words , with a proper choice of @xmath32 , the error of @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) can be minimized .",
    "we will see that this happens when @xmath32 is chosen to be the frequency at which the gw detector has the best sensitivity .",
    "we also note here that , if we limit ourselves to second order in the expansion with respect to @xmath40 , @xmath30 is given in the following form : @xmath41    as we have mentioned , the effect of the reheating is embedded in the function @xmath42 .",
    "we can understand the qualitative behavior of @xmath42 by using the fact that the amplitude of the igw is almost constant when the wavelength is longer than the horizon scale while it decreases as @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 being the scale factor ) once it enters the horizon . for @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "on the contrary , for @xmath29 , @xmath42 becomes close to @xmath35 .",
    "if the reheating temperature is not high enough , a slight deviation from the relation @xmath47 may affect the determination of the igw parameters @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "when the universe is dominated by the inflaton oscillation , the igw amplitude behaves as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the spherical bessel function , @xmath50 is the conformal wavenumber , and @xmath51 is the conformal time .",
    "then , for @xmath52 , which holds for superhorizon modes , the evolution of the igw amplitude has a slight dependence on @xmath50 as @xmath53 , which results in a slight deviation from @xmath47 . for the mode with @xmath29",
    ", we expect @xmath54 , with @xmath55 being a numerical constant .",
    "we have numerically calculated @xmath55 , and found @xmath56 .",

    "this is the case when the reheating temperature is higher than @xmath59 . because the effect of the reheating becomes negligible when",
    "@xmath24 is order of magnitude larger than the frequency range relevant for the gw detectors , two types of analyses are suggested .",

    "with the determination of @xmath30 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( as well as @xmath8 ) , information about the properties of inflaton may be obtained .",
    "thus , we briefly discuss the implication of the determination of the igw spectrum for the test of inflation models .",
    "if we take the chaotic inflation model we have introduced in section [ sec : spectrum ] as the model of inflation , the properties of the inflaton can be parameterized by two parameters , the inflaton mass @xmath80 and the decay rate @xmath17 ( or equivalently , the reheating temperature ) .",
    "if the reheating temperature is in the relevant range , it may be directly determined from the study of the igw spectrum , as we have explained in the previous section .",
    "in such a case , we can determine one of the very important parameter , @xmath8 .",
    "thus , in this section , we consider the case where @xmath8 is very high ; even in such a case , we will see that we may have a chance to acquire the upper and lower bounds on @xmath8 .",
    "as we have discussed , the reheating temperature is as high as @xmath165 if the inflaton decays via a planck - suppressed operator .",
    "in such a case , the igw spectrum at @xmath58 is insensitive to the reheating temperature , and hence the procedure to determine @xmath8 discussed in the previous section is difficult .",
    "as shown in table [ table : params ] , however , @xmath166 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 have slight dependences on the reheating temperature ( if the value of @xmath80 is fixed ) .",
    "this is because the number of the @xmath167-folding during the inflation varies as the reheating temperature changes .",
    "then , the inflaton amplitude at the time of the horizon exit of the mode @xmath32 , which is denoted as @xmath168 , changes .    in the chaotic inflation model with the inflaton potential given in eq .  , the expansion rate and the slow - roll parameters at the time when the mode @xmath32 exits the horizon are given by @xmath169 thus , combining these relations with eqs .   and",
    ", the values of @xmath80 and @xmath168 may be obtained with the measurement of @xmath30 and @xmath33 . because the value of @xmath168 ( and hence @xmath33 ) is insensitive to @xmath80 , information about @xmath33 can be translated to that about the reheating temperature .",
    "as shown in table [ table : params ] , the predicted value of @xmath33 varies from @xmath170 to @xmath171 for @xmath172 .",
    "thus , the error in the measurement of @xmath33 should be at the level of @xmath173 in order to acquire sensible information about the reheating temperature .",
    "the noise level slightly better than that of bbo - grand is required in order to perform such an analysis . if the noise level of ult - decigo is available , on the contrary , @xmath33 can be precisely determined .",
    "in such a case , assuming the chaotic inflation , @xmath8 is well determined even if @xmath24 is out of the sensitivity range of the gw detectors .",
    "for example , assuming that @xmath33 is measured as @xmath174 and @xmath175 , which are the expected accuracy in the two- and three - parameter analysis with @xmath98 , respectively ( see table [ table:1sigma ] ) , the reheating temperature is estimated to be @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively .",
    "we have discussed the prospects of the measurement of igw spectrum using future space - based gw detectors , like bbo and decigo . we have performed a detailed analysis for the determination of igw parameters , i.e. , the amplitude @xmath30 , the tensor spectral index @xmath33 , and its running @xmath34 .",
    "we have adopted the chaotic inflation model with parabolic inflaton potential as a fiducial model , and calculated the igw amplitude for the frequency relevant for the igw detectors . then , using such an amplitude as well as tensor spectral index and running as the fiducial values , we performed a statistical analysis to estimate the expected accuracy of the measurements of these parameters . here , we considered two cases .",
    "one is the case with high enough reheating temperature @xmath8 , for which the igw spectrum becomes insensitive to @xmath8 .",
    "the other is the case where @xmath8 is so low that the igw detectors may directly observe the signal of the reheating ; in such a case , the which is the igw spectrum is significantly suppressed in high frequency region .    in the case with high enough reheating temperature ,",
    "we have shown expected accuracies of the measurements of @xmath30 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , adopting several noise parameters ( which we call bbo - std , bbo - grand , and ult - decigo ) . adopting the chaotic inflation model which predicts @xmath178 at the cmb scale ,",
    "we have seen that non - zero value of the tensor spectral index @xmath133 may be confirmed with the noise level of bbo - grand with a few years of operation . for the detection of the running of the tensor mode , on the contrary",
    ", significant improvement of the noise level is necessary if @xmath179 .",
    "if the reheating temperature is relatively low , on the contrary , the future space - based gw detectors may put lower and upper bounds on @xmath8 .",
    "we have seen that , if the fiducial value of the reheating temperature , @xmath137 , is @xmath180 , the reheating temperature can be well constrained .",
    "we have estimated the expected bounds on the reheating temperature .",
    "in particular , with the two - parameter analysis taking @xmath166 and @xmath8 as free parameters , we have seen that the reheating temperature can be determined with the error of @xmath181 with bbo - std and @xmath182 with bbo - grand if @xmath183 gev , assuming 10 years of operation and the minimum frequency @xmath110 hz .",
    "if @xmath184 , on the contrary , the reheating temperature is bounded only from below .",
    "we have also compared our results with full likelihood with those with fisher matrix analysis .",
    "we have seen the results of two analysis may differ significantly in some cases .",
    "the determination of the tensor - to - scalar ratio provides important information about the normalization of the cosmic igw background .",
    "although it may be premature to conclude that @xmath185 based only on the result of bicep2 , our knowledge about the @xmath0-mode signal will be significantly improved in the near future because many efforts to detect the @xmath0-mode signal in cmb are on - going .",
    "once the existence of the igws is confirmed by the observation of the @xmath0-mode signal in the near future , the program to detect and study the igw spectrum in future space - based gw detectors is strongly suggested .",
    "such a program will provide important and unique information about inflation .",
