    "the number of known exoplanets is increasing rapidly , revealing a diverse range of systems with vastly different properties . transiting exoplanets offer a unique opportunity to study the structure and composition of planets other than those in our own solar system , as transit light curves allow a measurement of the radius of the planet , and the complementary radial velocity technique measures the mass . from the derived density",
    ", the bulk composition of the planet may be inferred .",
    "transiting planets also provide the opportunity to measure the composition of planets atmospheres .",
    "typically , transit light curves are modelled assuming the planet as an opaque disk , whose size is defined by the altitude at which the atmosphere becomes opaque to starlight . however , the optical depth in the atmosphere is wavelength dependent , being sensitive to atomic and molecular absorption .",
    "therefore , the transit depth and measured radius of a planet are wavelength dependent , and measuring the planetary radius as a function of wavelength may allow the detection of absorption features in the atmospheres , and thus enable observations to infer the presence of atomic and molecular species ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hot jupiters are a class of planets with masses similar to jupiter and on very short - period orbits , therefore they are intensely irradiated resulting in very hot atmospheres . consequently , their large atmospheric scale heights make them particularly good targets for this type of measurement .    there are two approaches to measuring the wavelength dependence of a planet s radius .",
    "transmission spectroscopy consists of monitoring the transit with spectroscopic measurements , which can be subsequently split into separate light curves for each wavelength channel , allowing a measurement of transit depth at each wavelength .",
    "this has been used to detect various species in the atmospheres of hot - jupiters , including hd 209458 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* na ) and hd 189733 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* h@xmath0o , ch@xmath1 ) , and has also suggested a haze in the upper atmosphere of hd 189733 @xcite at optical wavelengths .",
    "another method to measure the wavelength dependence of a planet s radius , is to make multi - colour photometric observations of the transit light curve , and measure the transit depth for each .",
    "spitzer observations of this type were used to infer the presence of h@xmath0o in the atmosphere of hd 189733 @xcite , although this is disputed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these measurements have provided a wealth of information which feeds into theories of planetary atmospheres . however , both methods have advantages and disadvantages , and have been the subject of some controversy . for example , photometric measurements are much more straight forward , and the data reduction and analysis use established methods , and are therefore relatively robust against instrumental systematic effects .",
    "however , observations are ( typically ) taken during different transits , and stellar activity may cause variations of the measured planetary radius due to variable spots on the surface of the star , which change as the star rotates and reveals different hemispheres , and also evolve on timescales comparable to the period of typical transiting planets @xcite .",
    "transmission spectroscopy on the other hand , avoids this problem by simultaneously monitoring the transit light curve at different wavelengths . whilst there is still a chromatic variance due to any spots on the stellar surface during a particular transit ,",
    "this is a much smaller effect than if the surface spot distribution has changed .",
    "however , transmission spectroscopy is usually affected by systematic noise from the telescope and instrument ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , often larger than the signal we are trying to measure .",
    "this is commonly treated by constructing a multi - linear model of the baseline function , which describes how the measured light curve of the star would behave in the absence of a planetary transit due to changes in the state of the optics and detector .",
    "this is built from a linear combination of parameters that describe the optical state of the system , such as the position of the spectral trace on the detector , the temperature of the detector , and in the case of hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations , the orbital phase of the observatory .",
    "the baseline function is determined from the out - of - transit observations , and then used to decorrelate the light curve by projecting the function to the in - transit observations ; however , the physical origins of these linear decorrelation models are poorly understood , and as we will see later , the choice of model has significant effects on the output transmission spectra .",
    "hst transmission spectroscopy with nicmos ( near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ) has led to some of the most detailed studies of exoplanet systems , but it in particular suffers from these systematics effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are comparable to if not larger than the expected signal due to molecular absorption . of the nicmos observations currently in the literature , one group have claimed the detection of several molecules in the atmospheres of various hot jupiters ( e.g. @xcite , hd 189733 ; @xcite , xo-1 ) .",
    "however , other analyses of nicmos transmission spectroscopy , have been unable to untangle the instrumental systematic effects from wavelength dependent absorption from the planet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , for hd 189733 , there have been significant disagreements with wavelength dependent photometric measurements of the light curve and transmission spectroscopy , with @xcite failing to detect water in the atmosphere of hd 189733 previously reported by @xcite , using narrow band photometric measurements with nicmos .",
    "@xcite attribute this to variable spot distributions for each of transit , arguing multi - colour photometric observations can not reach the required accuracy for molecular spectroscopy , despite @xcite accounting for this using continuous ground - based monitoring of the stellar flux .",
    "as these results are vital to our understanding of planetary atmospheres , we must explore the possibility that the wavelength dependance of the planetary radius is no more than systematic noise in the detector .",
    "as the hst orbits with a period of @xmath296 minutes , transit light curves are split into discrete orbits , typically sampling several out - of - transit portions of the light curve , used to establish the baseline function , and 12 in - transit portions .",
    "trends are typically seen in each orbit , related to the orbital phase of the hst and its effects on the position of the spectral trace .",
    "furthermore , as the optical system can not be reset to exactly the same configuration for every orbit , systematic offsets between the flux levels in each orbit may also result .",
    "efforts to gain a deeper understanding of nicmos systematics and obtain photon limited photometry are ongoing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the offsets are not satisfactorily addressed in much of the literature , as any systematic offset may not be corrected for or indeed may be over - corrected for when the baseline function is projected to the in - transit portion of the light curve in the case of an imperfect baseline model .",
    "these in - transit offsets will be hidden from the light curve residuals when fitting the transit depth , and therefore not taken into account in the error analysis .",
    "[ fig : nicmos_data ] shows a plot of the nicmos spectra of transiting planets reported in the literature to date ; transmission spectra for hd 189733 @xcite , gj-436 @xcite , and xo-1 @xcite , and dayside emission spectra for hd 189733 @xcite and hd 209458 @xcite .",
    "the emission spectra are obtained in much the same way as the transmission spectra , by observing an eclipse of the planet , and using the same linear decorrelation methods to correct for the baseline function .",
    "it is clear that all five spectra show approximately the same peak - to - peak amplitude , and have wavelength dependance on similar scales .",
    "this is perhaps surprising , given the planets have vastly different masses , radii and irradiation levels .",
    "transmission and emission spectra also show the same amplitudes . whilst this is by no means evidence that the spectra are the result of systematic noise in the detector , and the similarity could be coincidental",
    ", it is nonetheless wise to explore this possibility .",
    "it is therefore important that the results reported from nicmos transmission spectroscopy be re - analysed to confirm previous detections of molecules , in particular because the results are dependent on a complex decorrelation procedure , with an arguably _ ad hoc _ model .        here , we present a re - analysis of the three nicmos transmission spectra shown in fig .

    "[ sect : summary ] summarises and presents our conclusions .",
    "a transit of hd 189733 was monitored on 25 may 2007 with hst / nicmos , using the g206 grism covering the wavelength range 1.4  2.5 .",
    "analyses of these data were first reported in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter s08 ) . as hd 189733 is not in the continuous viewing zone of the hst , the transit was observed over five half - orbits ( @xmath3 minutes each ) , consisting of 638 spectra in total , all with exposure times of 1.624 seconds .",
    "the first , second , fourth and fifth orbits cover the out - of - transit part of the light curve and consist of 119 , 128 , 131 and 130 observations , respectively .",
    "these data are required to determine the photometric baseline .",
    "only the third orbit was taken in - transit , and consists of the remaining 130 images .",
    "in addition to the spectra , some exposures were taken at the beginning of the first orbit to enable wavelength calibration .",
    "the calibrated images , one of which is displayed in fig .  [ fig : hd189733_image ] , include all basic calibrations except for flat - fielding .",
    "correctly flat fielding spectroscopic data requires taking into account the wavelength dispersion and position of the source , and therefore a different flat - field correction would be required at each point along the spectral trace of the target .",
    "s08 argue that flat - fielding is not required for differential spectroscopy , as each light curve will be normalised before measurement of parameters from the light curves .",
    "however , strictly speaking flat - fielding is required to accurately determine the background value in each wavelength channel .",
    "this is particularly important , as underestimating or overestimating the background results in a variable transit depth , which is exactly what we are trying to measure .",
    "furthermore , the g206 grism has a relatively high background compared with nicmos s other two grisms ( about @xmath4 electrons per pixel per exposure ) , due to thermal background emission from hst .",
    "whilst the background is very stable temporally , unfortunately , it does significantly vary spatially over the detector by as much as 200 electrons per pixel per exposure .",
    "this will particularly effect the light curves extracted from the edge of the spectrum , where the overall counts are much lower .",
    "we did try flat - fielding each image using a flat - field taken with the g206 grism in place .",
    "this corrects for diffuse light over the whole detector .",
    "this will not effect the depth of the final normalised light curves except through the background value .",
    "this process does not provide a satisfactory background correction , and the analyses described below were attempted with and without flat - field corrections .",
    "we also note that the background varies quite smoothly , and therefore is unlikely to be responsible for any narrow ` features ' seen in the transmission spectrum , but can certainly affect the overall depth and shape .        prior to extracting the spectra",
    ", we identified the defective pixels flagged by the calibration pipeline , and additional significant outliers , and corrected for them by replacing the pixel value with an interpolation of the surrounding eight pixels . a relatively small number of pixels required corrections , and in fact this process has very little effect on the output spectra .",
    "a 1d spectrum was then extracted as follows for each image .",
    "for each column along the spectral trace in the dispersion axis ( x ) , a centroid along the spatial axis ( y ) was calculated to determine the position of the spectrum .",
    "a sum of 35 pixels along each column centred on this position was used to extract the flux for each wavelength channel , after subtraction of a background value for each pixel .",
    "a width of 35 pixels was chosen to minimise the rms in the white light curve of orbits 2 , 4 and 5 .",
    "this was repeated for 90 pixel columns along the dispersion axis .",
    "the extraction regions used are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189733_image ] . for the background subtraction",
    ", we experimented with various techniques .",
    "first , a global background subtraction was used , similarly to s08 .",
    "the background was taken to be the average of a large un - illuminated region above the spectral trace ( we tested using different regions ) .",
    "this is not ideal , as previously mentioned the background varies spatially over the detector . as a first order correction , we instead calculated the background separately for each pixel column , as the average value of the un - illuminated region above the spectral trace along the column .",
    "again we note that this does not provide a satisfactory correction , as the background varies along both x and y. both global and wavelength dependent corrections were used for the subsequent analysis .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , we will display results from data that is not flat - fielded , and using separate columns for background subtraction , but our conclusions remain the same for each case .",
    "extracted spectra from a typical in - transit and out - of - transit observation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189733_1d_spectra ] , giving approximately @xmath5 electrons in the brightest pixel channel , and approximately @xmath6 electrons in the faintest channel .",
    "the features in the spectra do not correspond to real stellar features , but result in variation of the sensitivity of the grism with wavelength .",
    "each wavelength channel in the 1d spectra is then used to construct a time - series , after binning in 5 pixels along the dispersion direction , resulting in 18 light curves .",
    "a ` white ' light curve was constructed by integrating the flux over the entire wavelength range for each image .",
    "this was extended to include 110 pixel columns , which minimises systematics arising from small changes in the position of the spectral trace .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189733_wlc ] , and shows the sampling of the light curve over the five orbits .",
    "systematics are evident in each orbit , but particularly for orbit one .",
    "this is commonly found in similar nicmos data ( see e.g. sects .",
    "[ sect : gj436_obs ] and [ sect : xo1_obs ] ) .",
    "it is attributed to spacecraft ` settling ' ( e.g. s08 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and orbit one is excluded for the remainder of this work .",
    "the raw light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189733_normalised_lightcurves ] for each of the 18 wavelength channels , after normalising by fitting a line through orbits 2 , 4 and 5 , and dividing the light curves by this function .",
    "the light curves are clearly seen to exhibit strong time - correlated noise , which needs to be removed if we are to measure the transmission spectrum at the level required to detect molecular features .",
    "the systematics may be understood to arise from small motions of the spectra across the detector , related to the orbital motion of the hst .",
    "referring back to fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189733_1d_spectra ] , the wavelike features in the spectra will move into different wavelength channels and cause features on short wavelength intervals , even if the stellar spectrum and flat - fielding are smooth .",
    "the optical state parameters , described by s08 , were therefore measured in an effort to model and remove these systematic effects .",
    "we extracted the shift of the spectral trace along the x axis ( @xmath7 ) by cross - correlation of the 1d spectra , the shift of the position of the y axis by averaging the centroids determined earlier ( @xmath8 ) , and the angle the spectral trace makes with respect to the x - axis ( @xmath9 ) by fitting a line to the centroids of the spectra .",
    "the width ( @xmath10 ) of each spectrum was also measured by fitting gaussian functions along each extraction column , and taking the average . in the absence of a direct measurement of the temperature ( @xmath11 ) of the detector , or a proxy calculated from the bias levels @xcite , a proxy for this was taken as the temperature of the nic1 mounting cup ( s08 ) . however ,",
    "this is not monitored at a high enough precision to accurately monitor the temperature .",
    "the temperature is an important parameter to describe the state of a nir detector , and this is likely an important limitation of nicmos analysis .",
    "a plot of the optical state parameters and the detector temperature is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : hd189733_decorr_parameters ] .",
    "it is important to note that we extract our parameters slightly differently from s08 in some cases .",
    "in particular we used an averaged value for the shifts in position @xmath7 and @xmath8 per image , in order to monitor the overall optical state of the detector , and therefore had identical parameters for all wavelength channels , unlike s08 .",
    "s08 determined x and y positions by fitting spectra along diagonals and rotating back along the two nominal axis , resulting in different parameters for each wavelength channel , and in some cases different trends . in either case , the parameters show a similar dispersion and amplitude , and should allow a similar removal of the systematics .",
    "each light curve was decorrelated using the multi - linear baseline model from s08 .",
    "this assumes that the baseline function can be constructed by a linear combination of the optical state vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 , the proxy for the detector temperature @xmath11 , and also the orbital phase of the hst ( @xmath12 ) and its square ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "in addition , we used a constant vector to represent the out - of - transit flux level ( @xmath14 ) , as clearly the overall flux level is not given by a linear function of the state variables , but rather the state variables are used to correct for variations from the expected out - of - transit flux .",
    "these parameters are hereafter collectively referred to as the ` decorrelation parameters ' . for each wavelength channel , the out - of - transit baseline flux is given by @xmath15 at time @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the coefficients for each of the @xmath18 decorrelation parameters ( in this case ; @xmath19 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , @xmath20 is the value of each decorrelation parameter @xmath21 for time @xmath16 , and @xmath22 the corresponding residual .",
    "this may be easily written in matrix form as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the state matrix containing the measured de - correlation parameters , @xmath25 is a vector containing the coefficients of each decorrelation parameter , and @xmath26 are the residuals .",
    "the best - fit coefficients @xmath27 are then found by linear least squares @xmath28 for orbits 2 , 4 and 5 _ only_. the model baseline function @xmath29 can then be reconstructed for _ all _ orbits from a linear combination of @xmath27 and @xmath24 ; @xmath30 each light curve is then decorrelated by dividing through by the model baseline function .",
    "this technique can only be expected to work if we interpolate for the in - transit orbit , and if the baseline function is well represented by the linear model over the range of the decorrelation parameters .    for this analysis , each light curve",
    "is treated _ independently _ , with @xmath27 calculated separately for each .",
    "an example of this decorrelation process on one of the wavelength channels is shown in fig .",

    "however , some of the correlated noise remains particularly in the in - transit orbit , and must be taken into account in the error analysis of the transmission spectrum .",
    "the dashed grey lines again show a transit model generated for hd 189733.,width=317 ]    in order to obtain the transmission spectrum from the light curves , a transit model must be fitted to each decorrelated light curve to measure the planetary radius .",
    "we used the transit model described in @xcite , which assumes a circular orbit to calculate the normalised separation of the star and planet centres ( @xmath31 ) as a function of time , using the orbital parameters and the masses and radii of the star and planet .",

    "the limb darkening parameters were calculated in each of the wavelength channels for a quadratic limb darkening law ( d. sing , private communication ) using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "the orbital parameters of the system and the stellar mass and radius were held fixed at the values given by @xcite , and the central transit time was determined from the ephemeris .",
    "each decorrelated light curve was then fitted for @xmath32 , to obtain the transmission spectrum .    to calculate the uncertainty in @xmath32 for each wavelength channel",

    "this method accounts for the correlated noise in the light curve by reconstructing light curves by combining the best - fit model and its residuals , but shifting the residuals before combining them to determine the effects of the correlated noise on the determined parameters .",
    "this method preserves both the correlated and random noise in the resampled light curves , and therefore both are taken into account when determining uncertainties .",
    "the residual permutation was applied to the raw light curves prior to performing the decorrelation procedure , in order to take into account uncertainties from both the linear decorrelation and the light curve fitting .",
    "the best fit baseline function @xmath29 and transit model @xmath33 were determined as before , and the residuals from the fit @xmath34 are used to reconstruct the light curve , but each time the residuals are shifted by a random offset to give @xmath35 .",
    "any residuals that fall off the ` edge ' are looped back to the beginning .",
    "the new light curve @xmath36 is then reconstructed by adding the shifted residuals to the best - fit model , followed by a pointwise multiplication of the best - fit baseline function ; @xmath37 the decorrelation and light curve fitting is done as before , to determine @xmath32 .",
    "the procedure is repeated 1000 times with random perturbations to the shift in residuals , each time varying the starting value for @xmath32 to ensure the starting parameters do not affect the results . the resulting distribution of @xmath32 is then used to estimate its uncertainty in each wavelength channel .      the resulting nicmos transmission spectrum for hd 189733 is shown in fig .

    "the data from s08 are also plotted for comparison , after converting from transit depth to @xmath32 . for the most part ,",
    "the spectra show the same basic shape .",
    "it is not clear exactly where the discrepancies in a few of the wavelength channels arise , but they are likely explained by one or a combination of the following ; different pixel columns and widths used for the wavelength channels , different methods used to determine the background , the fact that we fit for the light curve rather than just taking an average of the in - transit orbit , that the decorrelation parameters are extracted slightly differently , and finally the corrections applied by s08 for limb darkening and star spots .",
    "we were unable to reproduce exactly the same results as s08 using a global background correction .",
    "another obvious difference between the two spectra is that the uncertainties we calculate using the residual permutation method are significantly larger than those given in s08 , particularly at the edge of the spectrum .",

    "fig  [ fig : hd189733_trans_spec_all ] ) .",
    "in fact the only ` feature ' common to both , is the dip at around 2.1 , although its depth relative to the uncertainties varies .",
    "the edges of the spectrum show quite different behaviour .",
    "we interpret the significant differences in the two spectra as evidence that the linear baseline model is not sufficient to correct the light curves , and can induce unwanted offsets in the in - transit orbit , which are indistinguishable from a real atmospheric signal .",
    "we also conducted additional tests to see how dependent the transmission spectrum is on the decorrelation model .",
    "a ` quadratic ' decorrelation was tried by adding the terms @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , to the state matrix ( @xmath12 already has a quadratic term ) .",
    "we also made tests decorrelating the spectra after removing each vector from the state matrix .",
    "we found that the most important decorrelation parameter to be @xmath9 , and to a lesser extent @xmath8 .",
    "the other decorrelation parameters play a much less important role .",
    "this is consistent with the findings in s08 , and is rather obvious after closer inspection of the decorrelation parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189733_decorr_parameters ] . @xmath9 and @xmath8 show significant offsets between the in - transit orbit and the out - of - transit orbits .",
    "thus , decorrelating with these state parameters causes larger shifts in the in - transit orbit than the others , and consequently the most significant corrections to the transmission spectrum .",
    "the spectra produced using the ` quadratic ' decorrelation , and after removing @xmath9 from the state matrix are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189733_trans_spec_var ] .",
    "note all of the spectra plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189733_trans_spec_var ] are after the channel - to - channel correction has been applied , but its exclusion does not alter the results significantly for any case .",
    "it is clear from these plots that the various techniques used to decorrelate the light curves produce quite different output transmission spectra .",
    "each of the features reported in s08 vanishes in at least one of the cases .",
    "as @xmath9 was previously shown to be the most important parameter in the decorrelation , the interpretation of molecular features in the spectrum is heavily dependant on a linear dependance of the flux level with the angle the spectrum makes on the detector .",
    "we do not argue that any of these methods are better than the others or the method used by s08 , but they give incompatible results and there is no way to distinguish between them . whilst most of the systematic effects in the light curves are caused by intra - pixel sensitivity changes as the spectral trace drifts and rotates on the detector , it is not clear that a linear decorrelation will remove these systematics .",
    "in fact , we have shown that the decorrelation can cause spurious offsets in the in - transit flux level .",
    "furthermore , the largest disagreements between the spectra occur at the edges , where the background is expected to significantly affect the transit depth .",
    "the ratio of the true transit depth ( @xmath43 ) is related to the measured transit depth ( @xmath44 ) by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the ( uncorrected ) background counts , and @xmath47 the out - of - transit counts .",
    "therefore , an underestimated or overestimated background will lead to incorrect transit depths .",
    "this effect scales with the ratio of the background to the out - of - transit flux .",
    "thus where the flux count is lower , i.e. at the fainter channels ( the edges ) of the spectrum , this effect will be much greater .",
    "for the faintest channels , we have approximately @xmath48 electrons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hd189733_1d_spectra ] ) collected over 35 @xmath49 5 pixels .",
    "if we assume a background correction error of 50 electrons per pixel ( a conservative estimate considering the background can vary by up to 200 electrons per pixel ) , the ratio of true depth to measured depth is about 1.012 , more than enough to significantly affect the measured transit depth .",
    "clearly we can not trust the edges of the spectra to give us an accurate measurement of the planet - to - star radius ratio .",
    "a transit of gj-436 was monitored on 10 - 11th november 2007 with hst / nicmos , using the g141 grism covering the wavelength range 1.1  1.9 .",
    "analyses of these data were first reported in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter p09 ) .",
    "we only used the first of two light curves reported in p09 for this work , as they concluded that the noise and systematic effects were lower during the first visit .",

    "the spatial variation over the detector is about 10 electrons per pixel .",

    "it is interesting that the amplitude of the measured transit depth ( @xmath52 ) shows a similar amplitude to that of hd 189733 .",

    "the fact that we can produce a variable but unphysical transmission spectrum with the linear decorrelation model , suggests that we can not extract useful spectral information below about @xmath54 using nicmos transmission spectroscopy , at least using current methods .    for xo-1 we are unable to reproduce the results from t10 , because the decorrelation parameters we measure require an extrapolation for the in - transit orbits to determine the baseline function , and introduce large offsets in the flux levels for different orbits .",

    "we do not have enough information to identify the source of the discrepancy , but we expect that their uncertainties are underestimated , in a similar way to hd 189733 . this is all the more puzzling given that @xcite also produce decorrelation parameters that would require extrapolation for the in - transit orbits .",
    "we note the importance of reporting in detail the methods used to correct systematics when they dominate the error budget .",
