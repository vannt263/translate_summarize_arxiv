    "accurate radio pulsar distances are important for population and birthrate modeling and , combined with measurements of dispersion and faraday rotation , for studies of the ionized interstellar medium and galactic magnetic fields .",
    "parallax measurements can firmly fix the bottom rungs of the pulsar distance ladder , but parallaxes of even the closest pulsars are only a few milliarcseconds in amplitude , and such measurements are available for only nine pulsars ( see toscano et al .",
    "1999 for a recent list ) .",
    "four of these parallax measurements were made using timing studies of millisecond pulsars with particularly stable spin periods .",
    "the others were made with various vlbi techniques . the use of calibration sources within the primary antenna beam shows promise , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "observing at l  band with 25 meter telescopes provides a primary beam size of about 30 minutes of arc .",
    "only a small fraction of pulsars have calibrators within this small distance .",
    "the number of accessible target pulsars is greatly increased by the use of calibrators at greater offset angles , up to several degrees , but differential ionospheric phase delays make high precision comparison measurements very difficult .",
    "most pulsars are weak radio sources at high frequencies , where array resolution is high and ionospheric effects are minimized .",
    "observations are often made at l  band ( 1.4 to 1.7 ghz ) as a compromise , but even at l  band the ionosphere remains a significant obstacle .",
    "we have developed a new calibration technique to remove the effects of the ionosphere from the data and used it to measure a revised parallax of psr b0950 + 08 .",
    "at l  band , the vlba provides simultaneous access to a large spanned bandwidth and is sensitive enough to detect a pulsar within the changing ionosphere s timescale of about one minute .",
    "recently , gating the vlba correlator became possible .",
    "this allows the correlator to be turned off during the off pulse phase of the pulsar , increasing the signal to noise of the pulsar by a factor of 3 to 6 , depending on the pulse duty cycle . for psr b0950",
    "+ 08 the improvement was a factor of 3.6 .",
    "we observed the pulsar simultaneously in eight 8 mhz bands ranging from 1410 mhz to 1730 mhz .",
    "each band was split into thirty two 250 khz channels .",
    "the vlba antennas nod back and forth between the pulsar and the calibrator with cycle times of about five minutes .",
    "seven epochs from 1994 to 1999 were observed near parallax extrema .",
    "the first three epochs were ungated and used 1004 + 141 as a calibrator source .",
    "its distance of seven degrees from the pulsar made phase referencing difficult .",
    "these data were useful for developing techniques and understanding limitations but were not of high enough quality for accurate astrometry .",
    "the more recent epochs used j0946 + 1017 , less than three degrees distant from psr b0950 + 08 , as a calibrator .",
    "most astrometry at low frequency is done at night since the ionosphere phase fluctuations are two or three times stronger during the day .",
    "since parallax measurements are most effective when the target and the sun are 90 degrees apart in the sky , these observations need to be done at sunrise and sunset  the times when the ionosphere changes most rapidly .",
    "this is a vlbi phase - referenced @xcite experiment with an additional calibration step .",
    "a strong source , j0946 + 1017 , was used as the reference source . using this object s known position ,",
    "the fringe rates and delays were measured and interpolated over the pulsar scans .",
    "the calibrator is self - calibrated so that its structure can be modeled .",
    "the self - calibration phases are interpolated over the pulsar .",
    "this simple phase referencing determines the pulsar s position to less than 30 mas .",
    "the phase center is shifted to the pulsar s position and the 32 spectral channels within each 8 mhz band are averaged together .",
    "the large number of channels prevents bandwidth smearing from decorrelating the long baseline visibilities .",
    "the ionosphere , like the free electrons in the ism , introduces a frequency dependent delay to the radio waves .",
    "unlike for the ism , this delay can be drastically different above each antenna since the ionosphere has structure on all scales , ranging from meter - sized variations to the bulge caused by the sun s radiation which stretches a third of the way around earth .",
    "the ionosphere is also different along different lines of sight from the same antenna .",
    "since the lines of sight from each telescope to the pulsar and calibrator puncture the ionosphere at different points , phase - referencing only calibrates away the bulk ionosphere over each antenna , leaving spatial gradients in the ionosphere uncorrected .",
    "these gradients can change significantly on time scales shorter than one minute and are large enough to move the pulsar by as much as 10 mas per degree of source separation .",
    "a phase referenced image with no ionospheric correction is shown in figure [ fig : withion ] .    at a given time on a given baseline , the phase - referenced visibility phases have this structure : @xmath4 \\nu}_{\\mbox{non - dispersive } } + \\underbrace{\\delta b\\frac{1}{\\nu}}_{\\mbox{dispersive}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the projected baseline lengths , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pulsar s vector distance from the phase center ( the quantity that this experiment is trying to measure ) , and @xmath9 is the phase due to the unmodeled wet troposphere and is very small , introducing less than 45 degrees of phase .",
    "these three terms are non - dispersive and hence have the same frequency dependence .",
    "@xmath10 is measured in rad / ghz , and @xmath11 is in rad@xmath12ghz .",
    "@xmath13 is the phase due to uncorrected ionosphere .",
    "since the remaining ionosphere is the only dispersive term , it can be separated from the non - dispersive sources of phase .",
    "this separation , however , is complicated by phase ambiguity . for a given set of phase measurements , a whole family of solutions",
    "can be formed since @xmath14 can be added to the original phases . because our bandwidth is limited , any integral value of @xmath15 will generate a different solution with an almost equally good fit .",
    "it is fortunate that the value of @xmath10 is always small enough that a good guess of the pulsar s position constrains the ambiguity to a single value of @xmath15 .",
    "a bootstrapping approach is used to determine the pulsar s position .",
    "using just the 5 southwestern vlba antennas ( los alamos nm , pie town nm , fort davis tx , kitt peak az , and owens valley ca ) with a maximum baseline of 1500 km , a separate image is made for each 8 mhz band in the phase - referenced data .",
    "figures [ fig : if1 ] and [ fig : if8 ] show two such images . plotting the measured positions as a function of frequency reveals a trend  the points line up in frequency order .",
    "if we assume a simplified model of the ionosphere as a single wedge lying above all the antennas then we would expect the pulsar to appear at @xmath16 .",
    "fitting for @xmath17 , the extrapolated infinite frequency position , yields an initial guess of the pulsar s position ( the star on figures [ fig : if1 ] and [ fig : if8 ] ) with a precision of 3 - 10 mas .",
    "the wedge model is certainly far from correct over the whole earth but works fairly well for the southwest array . because the ionosphere changes so quickly , a 15 to 30 minute snapshot usually works better than imaging all of the data .    to get antenna - based phases as a function of frequency , the pulsar is self - calibrated with a solution interval of between twelve and thirty seconds and the antenna - based phase corrections are recorded .",
    "the self - calibration phases can not be applied to the pulsar , as that would move the pulsar to the phase center . for each of the southwestern antennas , the nondispersive and dispersive components of the self - calibration solutions are fit , holding the geometric @xmath7 and @xmath8 terms fixed .",
    "this is reasonable since we know the pulsar s location to much less than 30 mas , the fringe spacing of the longest southwestern baseline .",
    "the other antennas are initially ignored as the phase contribution due to geometric delay is significant on the longer baselines .",
    "a new calibration table is made containing only the dispersive @xmath18 corrections that were fit to the data .",
    "imaging the data with these corrections produces a new position accurate to less than a milliarcsecond . with the improved pulsar position",
    ", the fitting for @xmath11 and imaging are repeated with all antennas .",
    "the final calibration table contains phase corrections for each antenna tabulated at time intervals of a minute or less .",
    "figure [ fig : kpnl ] shows the @xmath11 values for the kitt peak - to - north liberty baseline .",
    "this final image has much less scattered power and all frequencies appear at the same location ( figure [ fig : withoution ] ) .    in summary , although the self - calibration process is used to derive antenna - based phases over short periods of time , only the dispersive part of these phase terms is removed , removing the ionospheric distortions .",
    "the non - dispersive part of the phases which contain information about the source position ( as well as small atmospheric terms ) remain in the data .",
    "psr b0950 + 08 has a published parallax of @xmath19 mas @xcite .",
    "this measurement was made with a three element vlbi array consisting of arecibo , the 140 ft .",
    "antenna at green bank and the 40 m antenna at owens valley .",
    "a 3-element interferometer produces a beam pattern with severe lobe ambiguity . to break the degeneracy of the solution ,",
    "the proper motion was used to select a self - consistent set of lobes .",
    "unfortunately , the published values of @xmath20 mas / yr and @xmath21 mas / yr @xcite were not sufficiently accurate , causing an incorrect choice of lobes .    the four gated epochs of data were calibrated as described and fit with a model with five components : position of pulsar ( two components ) , proper motion of pulsar ( two ) and parallax ( one ) .",
    "the fit is shown in figure [ fig : motion ] , and the proper motion and parallax are : @xmath22 the first three epochs of data suggest a parallax of @xmath23 mas suggesting some stability of correction even with a calibrator separation of 7 degrees",
    ". the nutation model in the correlator may leave an annual signature with an amplitude of about 40 @xmath24as per degree of separation @xcite , about 0.1 mas in this experiment .",
    "systematic errors such as these are not included in the error bars but are expected to be less than 0.3 mas .",
    "there has been a long - standing problem of reconciling the electron density derived from the distance to psr b0950 + 08 with that based on x - ray data @xcite .",
    "this measurement puts the pulsar more than twice as far away , changing the local electron density from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , a value much closer to the estimated electron density inside our local bubble , @xmath27 .",
