    "processes involving flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) are of great importance for supersymmetric model building , because they probe the supersymmetry - breaking sector with an enormous sensitivity . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with generic flavor structure fcnc processes are mediated by the strong interaction through diagrams involving squarks and gluinos . today s precise experimental data on flavor violation in k , d and b physics leave little room for mechanisms of flavor violation other than the established cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mechanism of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this incompatibility of the generic mssm with experiment is known as the susy flavor problem .",
    "it points towards a mechanism of supersymmetry breaking which is dominantly flavor - blind and only feels the flavor violation of the yukawa sector . from a phenomenological point of view",
    "one would like to assess the possible size of the deviations from this scenario of _ minimal flavor violation ( mfv)_. in an appropriately chosen basis of the ( s)quark superfields ( the super - ckm basis ) one can parameterize the deviations from mfv by flavor - off - diagonal entries of the squark mass matrices . by confronting",
    "the squark - gluino mediated amplitudes with precision data one can constrain the sizes of these off - diagonal squark - mass terms . once superparticles are discovered and their masses are determined , these fcnc analyses may lead to insights into the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .    when the mssm with explicit soft breaking was first written down in @xcite it was already realized , that these breaking - terms are potential sources of flavour violation .",

    "@xcite discovered that neutralinos and gluinos have flavor - changing couplings once the quark and squark fields are rotated into the physical basis with diagonal mass matrices . in order to simplify the calculations and to parameterize the non - minimal sources of flavor violation in a generic way the mass insertion approximation ( mia )",

    "al.@xcite fcnc data ( on b mixing , k mixing , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) were used to constrain the off - diagonal elements of the sfermion mass matrices , while the diagonal ones were constrained from the electric dipole moments ( and from a fine tuning argument ) . in that work",

    "measurements and theoretical standard - model predictions are used .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties of the sm are treated in a consistent and systematic way . in each case",
    "we compare the size of the fcnc transition to the previously known lo result : with the inclusion of our self - energies the bounds on the off - diagonal elements of the squark mass matrix change drastically , especially if the susy particles are rather heavy . in sect .",
    "5 we conclude .",
    "in this section we show how to treat the chirally enhanced parts of flavor - changing self - energies in the full mssm and how to absorb them into mixing matrices entering the feynman rule of the quark - squark - gluino vertex . in this way",
    "all enhanced two - loop and three - loop diagrams are automatically included in the lo calculation to all orders in @xmath33 .",
    "chirally enhanced corrections , in which we are interested here , have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite from a loop - corrected quark mass matrix , in a formalism in which the heavy susy particles are integrated out .",
    "when these expressions are combined with some one - loop amplitude this method can , in principle , reproduces the chirally enhanced two - loop ( or three - loop ) fcnc amplitude to leading non - vanishing order in @xmath33 , where @xmath34gev is the electroweak vev . since the squark mixing angles scale as @xmath33 , scenarios with large left - right mixing among squarks",
    "are not properly covered in this approach .",
    "in particular , the widely - studied large-@xmath5 scenarios typically involve large sbottom mixing and therefore call for an analysis beyond the decoupling limit . on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite goes beyond our work by also including electroweak and higgs - mediated contributions to the wilson - coefficients .",
    "another important difference between ref .",
    "@xcite and this paper concerns the definitions of the super - ckm basis and the mass insertion parameters :    * we use the tree - level definition of the super - ckm basis ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) which permits an analytical solution to the necessary all - order resummations of enhanced corrections . with the on - shell definition of ref .  @xcite the self - energies and the squark mass matrices depend mutually on each other , which requires an iterative numerical evaluation of both quantities .",
    "this definition clouds the relations between observables and fundamental parameters like the trilinear susy - breaking terms @xmath35 ( as discussed later in this section ) .",
    "our results are more transparent and enable us to identify a previously neglected parameter region with dramatically enhanced corrections to meson - antimeson mixing ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : dfp ] . ) * concerning the definition of the mass insertion parameters @xmath29 we choose the most common one ( see for example @xcite ) in which the mass insertion is the entire off - diagonal element of the squark mass matrix divided by the average squark mass . on the other hand , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite only include the term @xmath36 into their definition of the mass insertion parameters .",
    "this leads to an artificial dependence of all corrections , even the ones independent of a quark mass , on @xmath5 . furthermore , if the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite would have chosen our definition of the mass insertions ( while keeping their definition of the super - ckm basis ) all chirally enhanced corrections would be simply absent , instead they would be implicitly contained in the definition of the @xmath29 s .",
    "throughout this paper we use the notations and conventions of ref .",
    "the self - energies can be divided into a chirality - flipping and a chirality - conserving part : @xmath37 \\label{zerlegung}\\ ] ] since the susy particles are known to be much heavier than the five lightest quarks , it is possible to expand in the external momentum unless one external quark is the top .",
    "we are not going to study the case of an external top further in this article , because there are no useful data on fcnc top decays . the part proportional to @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ zerlegung ] ) can be neglected since no chiral enhancement is possible .",
    "thus the following simplified expression for the self - energy is sufficient for our purpose : @xmath39 if @xmath40 is large , fcnc diagrams with this self - energy in an external leg ( as in fig .",
    "[ gluino - boxen+selbstenergien ] ) will compete with the leading order diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ gluino - boxen ] ) . for @xmath41",
    "the enhancement can further stem from @xmath42 in which case an all - order resummation is necessary @xcite , leading to a correction of the tree - level relation @xmath43 to @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ mqdel ] ) we have used the fact that @xmath45 can be decomposed into @xmath46 even if the physical squark masses are chosen as input parameters .",
    "@xmath47 is proportional to @xmath48 ( and @xmath49 is independent of @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 is proportional to @xmath52 . if we neglect the latter contribution eq .",
    "( [ mqdel ] ) reduces to the expression of ref .",
    "@xmath53 is the physical quark mass , with an on - shell subtraction of the susy contributions , as determined from low - energy data . for a detailed discussion of the relation between yukawa couplings and quark masses for different renormalization schemes",
    "see ref .  @xcite . for up - quarks",
    "one must replace @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ mqdel ] ) and may omit @xmath47 , which is now suppressed with @xmath55 .",
    "as already mentioned , the chirally enhanced parts of the sqcd self - energies do not decouple .",
    "this means they do not vanish in the limit @xmath56 but rather converge to a constant .",
    "therefore the corresponding fcnc diagrams of the type in fig .",
    "[ gluino - boxen ] scale with @xmath26 in the same way as the lo diagram .",
    "we will find that the two - loop and three - loop diagrams compete with the lo ones , especially for rather large and non - degenerate squark masses .",
    "there are different possibilities to handle flavor - changing self - energies in external legs : the conceptually simplest version is to treat them in the same way as one - particle - irreducible diagrams @xcite . so far we have implied this method , which is best suited to identify chirally enhanced contributions .",
    "calculations are easiest , however , if one absorbs the chirally enhanced corrections into the quark - squark - gluino vertex through unitary rotations @xmath57 ( @xmath58 denotes the chirality ) in flavor space @xcite .",
    "these rotations alter the feynman rule for the squark - quark - gluino vertex : @xmath59 with @xmath60 \\delta u_r^q \\,=\\ ,   \\left ( { \\begin{array}{*{6}c } 0 &   { \\frac{1}{{m_{q_2 } } } { \\sigma _ { 12}^{q\\,rl } }   } &   { \\frac{1}{{m_{q_3 } } } { \\sigma _ { 13}^{q\\,rl } } }   \\\\             { \\frac { { - 1}}{{m_{q_2 } } } { \\sigma _ { 21}^{q\\,lr } }   } &   0 &   { \\frac{1}{{m_{q_3 } } } { \\sigma _ { 23}^{q\\,rl } } }   \\\\             { \\frac { { - 1}}{{m_{q_3 } } } { \\sigma _ { 31}^{q\\,lr } } } &   { \\frac { { - 1}}{{m_{q_3 } } } { \\sigma _ { 32}^{q\\,lr } }   } & 0          \\end{array } } \\right)\\\\           \\end{array }         \\label{deltau}\\ ] ] the procedure in eq .",
    "( [ wren ] ) can be viewed as a short - cut to include the self - energy in the external quark line , in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite . alternatively eq .  ( [ wren ] )",

    "the requirement to maintain the structure of a softly broken susy theory within the renormalization process restricts the allowed counterterms to the quark - squark - gluino vertex .",
    "counterterms stemming from field renormalizations , however , are harmless in this respect , because field renormalizations trivially drop out from the lsz formula for transition matrix elements.]the inclusion of the enhanced corrections into the lo calculation is now simply achieved by performing the replacements of eq .",
    "( [ wren ] ) in this feynman rule .",
    "therefore here the exact diagonalization of the squark mass matrix is preferred over mia .",
    "the exact diagonalization has also the advantage that the analysis can be extended to the large @xmath5 region in which certain off - diagonal entries can have the same size as the diagonal ones .    here a comment on the definition of the super - ckm basis and the renormalization scheme is in",
    "order ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    * we define the super - ckm basis as follows : starting from some weak basis we diagonalize the tree - level yukawa couplings and apply this unitary transformation to the whole supermultiplet .",
    "this is a natural definition of the super - ckm basis because of the direct correspondence between the susy - breaking lagrangian and physical observables .",
    "whenever we refer to some element of a squark mass matrix , this element is defined in this basis . when passing from lo to nlo or even higher orders",
    "the definition of the squark mass matrices is unchanged , i.e.  no large chirally enhanced rotations appear at this step .",
    "any additional non - enhanced ( i.e.  ordinary sqcd ) corrections are understood to be renormalized in a way which amounts to a minimal renormalization of the squark mass matrices . * from given squark mass matrices we calculate the self - energies @xmath61 and then the rotations @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ wren ] ) . calculating lo amplitudes with the corrected @xmath63 from eq .",
    "( [ wren ] ) then properly includes the desired chirally enhanced effects .",
    "the order of the two steps is important : first the super - ckm basis is defined from the tree - level structure of the yukawa sector and the finite loop effects are included afterward , without influence on the definition of the super - ckm basis .",
    "alternatively one could define the super - ckm basis using an on - shell scheme which eliminates the self - energies in the external legs by shifting their effect into the definition of the super - ckm basis : applying the inverse of the rotation in eq .",
    "( [ wren ] ) first to the whole ( s)quark superfields will leave the squark - quark - gluino vertex flavor - diagonal .",
    "( further supersymmetry is still manifest , e.g.  the sbottom field is the superpartner of the bottom field",
    ". this would not be the case if different rotations were applied to quark and squark fields . )",
    "if one defines this basis as the super - ckm basis ( which now changes in every order of perturbation theory ) one will find very different constraints on the off - diagonal elements of the squark mass matrices than with our method .",
    "the effect of the enhanced self - energies will be entirely absorbed into the values of the elements of the squark mass matrices , these self - energies will not appear explicitly , and the calculation of lo diagrams in the usual way will be sufficient .",
    "however , the squark mass matrices determined from data using this method will not be simply related to a mechanism of susy breaking , because the extracted numerical value of a given matrix element will also contain the physics associated with the chirally enhanced self - energies .",
    "effects from susy breaking and electroweak breaking are interwoven now and further the elements of the squark mass matrix do not obey simple rg equations anymore .",
    "it is illustrative to consider the popular case of soft - breaking terms which are universal at a high scale , say , the gut scale .",
    "the unitary rotations diagonalizing the yukawa couplings will lead to soft - breaking terms which are proportional to the unit matrix in flavor space .",
    "the rg evolution down to low scales will then lead to small flavor - off - diagonal ll entries of the squark mass matrices which are governed by the tree - level ( as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ckm matrix . obviously , the elements of the squark mass matrices defined in this way are the quantities which one wants to probe in order to discriminate between high - scale universality and other possible mechanisms of soft flavor violation .",
    "the above - mentioned unitary rotations diagonalize the tree - level yukawa couplings , while the rotations with @xmath62 are only meaningful after electroweak symmetry breaking and are therefore a low - scale phenomenon . during the rg evolution",
    "the yukawa couplings essentially stay diagonal and the small unitary rotations bringing the low - scale yukawa couplings back to diagonal form are unrelated to the soft breaking sector ( and involve no chiral enhancement ) . therefore the procedure described in items i ) and ii ) is the adequate method to probe the flavor structure of susy breaking . for a discussion of renormalization schemes in the context of mfv see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "consider an fcnc transition @xmath64 in mia : if the squark mass @xmath65 is degenerate with @xmath66 , the renormalization effects of the squark - quark - gluino vertex drop out in fcnc processes .",
    "this can be understood in the diagrammatical approach by realizing that diagrams with a flavor - changing self - energy in the outgoing @xmath67 leg cancel with the diagram where the self - energy is in the incoming @xmath68 leg , because the intermediate loop is the same for both diagrams .",
    "thus , in order to demonstrate the effects of the renormalized quark - squark - gluino vertex non - degenerate squarks are necessary . for definiteness",
    "we choose the flavor - diagonal left - handed and right - handed mass terms equal and further set @xmath69 if not mentioned otherwise .",
    "lighter third - generation squarks are plausible in scenarios with high - scale flavor universality , in which renormalization group ( rg ) effects usually drive the bilinear soft terms of the third generation down .",
