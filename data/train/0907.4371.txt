    "clusters of galaxies are a powerful probe of astrophysics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "for example , the cluster mass function is very sensitive to the cosmic mean matter density , to the initial fluctuation amplitude @xcite and to dark energy dynamics @xcite .",
    "it can be predicted to high accuracy by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the masses of galaxy clusters can not be observed directly .",
    "thus one either needs to infer the masses of observed clusters from some more directly observable cluster property , requiring accurate knowledge of the observable - mass relation and its scatter , or one must directly compare observed and predicted cluster abundance as a function of such observables .",
    "these include the x - ray luminosity and temperature of the intracluster gas @xcite , the number and velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies @xcite , the number of giant arcs @xcite , the weak - lensing signal @xcite , and the sunyaev - zeldovich signal induced by the cluster @xcite .",
    "predictions for many cluster observables ( e.g. the x - ray luminosity or the cluster richness ) and for their relation to the cluster mass require modelling of astrophysical processes such as gas cooling and galaxy formation . although inaccuracies in such astrophysical models are an unpleasant source of uncertainty for cosmological parameter estimation , they mean that comprehensive observations of clusters can be used to constrain cosmological parameters and models for cluster / galaxy evolution simultaneously .",
    "the largest sample of observed galaxy clusters currently available is the maxbcg cluster catalogue @xcite , this was extracted from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) using maxbcg , an optical cluster - finding algorithm @xcite .",
    "constraints on the scatter in the velocity dispersion - richness relation and the mass - richness relation of these clusters have been derived from cluster x - ray and galaxy velocity dispersion observations @xcite .",
    "weak - lensing measurements of average cluster mass profiles have also been used to calibrate the mass - richness relation , the mass - optical luminosity relation , and mass - to - light ratio profiles of the maxbcg clusters @xcite .",
    "these data provide significant constraints on cosmological parameters @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate how well physically based models for galaxy formation in a @xmath0cdm universe can reproduce the observed relations of cluster richness and luminosity to other cluster properties , most notably mass .",
    "we also investigate what information on cosmological parameters and galaxy evolution can be obtained by comparing model predictions to observation .",
    "we use the millennium simulation @xcite and two smaller @xmath1-body simulations of cosmic structure formation @xcite in conjunction with semi - analytic models of galaxy evolution @xcite to create mock catalogues of galaxy clusters selected similarly to the maxbcg catalogue .",
    "we compute cluster abundances , average cluster masses , and weak - lensing mass profiles as a function of cluster richness and luminosity , and we compare these to observational results for the sdss maxbcg sample .",
    "in addition , we investigate the scatter in the mass - richness relation , and we discuss how well one can recover the cluster mass function and the weak - lensing mass profiles from the richness - binned cluster abundances and mean masses .    the semi - analytic galaxy models used here couple star formation in galaxies to the properties of the evolving dark matter halo distribution in which the galaxies live .",
    "the models have been adjusted to be consistent with various observations , e.g. the luminosities , stellar masses , morphologies , gas contents and correlations of galaxies at low redshift , but they have not been tuned to match the properties of rich clusters .",
    "the comparison to observations provided here is thus a direct test of these models and their description of the physical processes relevant for galaxy formation .",
    "this contrasts with halo occupation distribution models @xcite , where the galaxy populations of clusters are adjusted to fit observation without considering in detail how they could have been built up by physical processes within the evolving dark matter distribution .",
    "our paper is organised as follows .",
    "we discuss the @xmath1-body simulations and galaxy models , as well as our methods for creating the simulated cluster samples from them in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] .",
    "results for our simulated cluster samples and a comparison to observation are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "our paper concludes with a summary and discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we use cosmological @xmath1-body simulations to analyse the matter distribution in and around galaxy clusters in two different @xmath0cdm cosmologies .",
    "we infer the properties of the galaxies in the clusters from model galaxy catalogues generated by applying semi - analytic galaxy formation models to halo assembly trees generated from the outputs of the @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "we then compute richness and luminosity estimates for clusters in the model galaxy catalogues taking into account several observational features of optical cluster - finding algorithms , in particular maxbcg by @xcite .      .",
