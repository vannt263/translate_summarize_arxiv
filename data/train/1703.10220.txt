    "latest developments in cosmology are provided by deep redshift surveys for cosmological structures .",
    "these structures develop from evolution of primordial perturbations generated during inflation .",
    "originally , quantum fluctuations of the inflation field set the seeds of curvature perturbations at primordial epochs .",
    "the nature of these fluctuations are well studied in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the fingerprints of these fluctuations on large scale structures ( lss ) are also important since the current and future galaxy surveys will take high precision measurements of galaxy clustering .",
    "this provides enough statistical precision to solve the issues in the standard model of cosmology .",
    "the importance of lss is highlighted by the fact that lss surveys are three dimensional , whereas the cmb is two dimensional .",
    "we study the fingerprints of long modes that come from inflation using the relativistic approach to large scale observables .",
    "+ to interpret galaxy and lss survey observations correctly , one should note that as the light propagates through the cosmos , its path is modified by inhomogeneities .",
    "therefore , one needs to use general relativistic calculations to relate the observables to the inhomogeneities . since the exact relativistic calculation for cosmological structure observables is complicated @xcite , usually the first or the second order perturbations of the einstein equations",
    "are used to calculate these observables .",
    "some of these effects on the observed fluctuations of galaxies are the dark matter density fluctuations , the redshift - space distortions ( the peculiar velocity effect in the redshift space of light ) and the magnification bias which are studied in @xcite . the standard method to derive the full relativistic expression for galaxy clustering",
    "is done by tracing back the photon path given the observed redshift and the angular position of the source galaxies .",
    "a fully general relativistic expression for the observed galaxy density contrast includes volume distortions due to the light deflections , evolving number densities , galaxy bias , as well as the magnification bias generalized to the evolving luminosity function .",
    "these relativistic effects are usually named projection effects .",
    "+ generally , there are different wavelengths for the gravitational potential that come from the early universe fluctuations .",
    "the long wavelength potential can produce a superhorizon perturbation that might have observable effects on the cmb or on other large scale structure observables .",
    "the power asymmetry in the cmb as observed by planck satellite @xcite ( for earlier reports of hemispherical asymmetry in wmap data see @xcite ) can be the generic property of some early universe models .",
    "this issue has been recently revisited in works such as @xcite and @xcite which use a local - variance estimator .",
    "the observations show that the power spectrum in the northern hemisphere is different from the power spectrum in the southern hemisphere .",
    "erickcek et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed that a superhorizon perturbation would introduce a preferred direction that generates the power asymmetry . along this way , the predictions of inflationary models with a long mode modulation of large scale structures are presented in @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", it was shown that a long constant @xcite and a long gradient mode @xcite can be gauge artifacts of the perturbation theory which does not leave any effect on the cmb @xcite .",
    "note that the vanishing contribution of a gradient to the cmb is non trivial .",
    "now , our aim is to study the non trivial effects of long modes which could be possibly observed in the future galaxy surveys .",
    "our goal in this paper is to extend the investigation of the long gradient modes effects to other large scale observables like the galaxy number counts considering the subtleties that arise from the bias .",
    "+ given the high precision of lss surveys and some hints of the cmb asymmetry from long mode perturbations , we study the imprints of these long modes on other large scale observables as well .",
    "the cancellation of the pure gradient modes in the galaxy number counts is nontrivial as various new effects appear compared to the cmb case .",
    "specifically , we show that the contribution of a pure gradient mode to large scale observables vanishes . using this frame work",
    ", we show that the coupling of the long gradient modes to short modes does not modulate the smoothed matter variance at a fixed physical scale if some form of consistency condition is satisfied .",
    "therefore , we confirm the consistency of the definition ( [ halo ] ) .",
    "+ the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin with a review of the long mode effects in the perturbation theory in section ii .",
    "we also discuss the importance of extending the previous studies to other large scale observables .",
    "the study of large scale observables is presented in two sections .",
    "we calculate the three large - scale observables in the presence of long gradient mode in section iii , after reviewing the relativistic derivation of large scale observables .",
    "the main section is section iv .",
    "it is devoted to the study of the galaxy clustering quantities such as the galaxy number counts and the halo bias in presence of a long gradient mode .",
    "finally , our conclusion and discussion are presented in section v. the latin indices indicate the space components and greek indices indicate the space time components and we have set @xmath0 .",
    "in cosmological perturbation theory , gauge invariant quantities are defined with the assumption that perturbations fall off at infinity .",
    "this allows to decompose perturbations as scalars , vectors , and tensors ( svt ) .",
    "examples of perturbations that do not vanish at infinity are zero momentum modes and pure gradient modes . + * zero momentum modes : * in the perturbation theory zero momentum modes are important , because they modulate the power spectrum in the case of single field slow - roll inflation as derived in @xcite .",
    "this modulation is known as the consistency condition .",
    "these zero momentum modes will induce a local type non - gaussianity .",
    "it is argued that the consistency relations are true in models of inflation in which the only dynamical field is the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "these consistency relations are also derived in the newtonian limit in @xcite .",
    "although this type of non - gassainity is small and proportional to @xmath1 , it is crucial to know if our large scale observations are really contaminated by such effects .    along this line",
    ", it is shown that even after fixing the gauge , zero momentum transformations are still allowed @xcite .",
    "this remaining gauge freedom is shown to be the source of ir divergences @xcite .",
    "that is because one needs boundary conditions to uniquely solve for the lapse function after imposing the conventional comoving gauge condition .",
    "it is shown that zero momentum modes in the metric can be removed by a coordinate transformation , so they do not have any observable effect as they induce a relative shift in the expansion history .",
    "the vanishing effect of a constant mode in the power spectrum is emphasized in @xcite . + * gradient modes : * let us suppose that we have a long wavelength perturbation expanded as @xmath2 in the fourier space , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the scale factor , the hubble parameter and the fourier mode for the long mode respectively .",
    "this perturbation appears in the expansion of primordial perturbations of the form @xmath6 .",
    "the average of such perturbations should vanish in the whole universe in order to keep homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "we suppose that the effect of such a perturbation does not vanish in our hubble patch .",
    "it is also shown that pure gradient modes are removed by a coordinate transformation in the metric @xcite . in the newtonian gauge",
    "this transformation is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined as @xmath10 that is because the effect of a pure gradient mode is an acceleration which is not observable locally .",
    "+ in this manner , we extend the gradient mode studies to other large scale observables including cosmic rulers , galaxy number counts and the halo bias .",
    "the vanishing effect of gradient modes on observables is not trivial given that various relativistic terms appear ( equation ( [ galaxy - p ] ) ) .",
    "a consistent general relativistic formulation of galaxy clustering should take into account all effects such as displacements , velocities and other new relativistic effects naturally .",
    "the especial case of the halo bias needs to be treated in a different way , because we need to consider coupling to short modes .",
    "we will show that in the general relativistic formulation , the effects of a gradient mode vanish if some forms of consistency condition hold .",
    "+ to study gradient mode effects , one needs to define the observables .",
    "this is done in the relativistic frame work for observables .",
    "the observables are gauge invariant as a prior and made of information on the past light cone .",
    "they should to be devoid of gauge artifacts as well .",
    "a long gradient mode is gauge artifact .",
    "the observables are described by the standard clocks , the standard rulers and the galaxy number counts @xcite .",
    "one example of such a clock is the cmb on large scales .",
    "next section is devoted to study of effects of long gradient modes on observables .",
    "+ the other cosmological observable is the galaxy number count .",
    "we also study the gradient mode effects on galaxy number counts .",
    "galaxy number counts importance is highlighted by the fact that future surveys will probe the cosmos on large volumes with unprecedented precision .",
    "because of their significant statistical precision , they will be able to discriminate between inflationary models by the level of non - gaussianity .",
    "it is crucial to consistently formulate all the effects in order to correctly interpret the data .",
    "other relativistic formulations have recently emerged @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite use the evolution equation for jacobi map to derive the galaxy number counts .",
    "we found that our result of the galaxy number counts agrees with the results given in @xcite . in next sections ,",
    "we study the imprints of gradient modes using relativistic definition for large scale observables .",
    "one of the interesting observable quantities in the lss is the galaxy number density fluctuation .",
    "this quantity is measured in the redshift space .",
    "it is well known that the observed power spectrum for galaxy number density is modified by the peculiar velocities as described by kaiser formula @xcite . however ,",
    "for large sky surveys this formula is hindered by the fact that this formula does not include all the relativistic terms consistently .",
    "basically , the problem of deriving the relativistic correction terms starts by tracing photons paths in an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "since photons are traveling through inhomogeneities , their path will deviate from the straight path in the frw universe and these inhomogeneities change the observed size of rulers , like the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) or the power spectrum peak and survey volume .",
    "in addition , on large scales , gauge effects become important and should be taken into account . hence , a gauge invariant formulation is important . for example , galaxies are thought to trace the underlying dark matter overdensity and are biased by a scale independent factor @xmath11 with respect to the dark matter overdensity .",
    "this definition is obscured because changing the gauge will introduce scale dependencies .",
    "in addition , observables should have physical interpretation",
    ". we will first review how the relativistic effects are derived .",
    "the details of derivations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we only give the main points of derivation here to introduce the notation .",
    "we will then show that the gradient mode contribution to all cosmic ruler perturbations vanishes identically .",
    "+      an observer screen space is a two dimensional space orthogonal to his velocity @xmath12 and the photon four - vector @xmath13 .",
    "the observer sees the cosmos images by projecting on to his own instantaneous screen space spanned by orthonormal basis @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these are also orthogonal to the observer s velocity @xcite .",
    "+ when a photon is observed at the redshift @xmath16 ( observed redshift ) , its apparent position is attributed as @xmath17 . in this frame work ,",
    "the apparent position is always computed assuming a homogeneous universe .. refers to apparent quantities . ]",
    "note that @xmath17 also depends on direction at the observer .",
    "the photon trajectory at the observed redshift @xmath16 is deviated from a similar trajectory in a homogeneous universe .",
    "the actual position of the source is obtained by integrating the geodesic equations for the photons in an inhomogeneous universe as shown in fig.([fig:1 ] ) .",
    "these deviations are gauge dependent and unobservable .",
    "because null geodesics are conformally invariant , it is simpler to use conformally transformed metric and affine parameter for the photons . in this way the photon geodesics have simple expressions .",
    "but it is important to use the correct metric in the expressions ( [ proj1 ] , [ redshift ] ) .",
    "the photon geodesics is solved for the source position in @xcite .",
    "we present the final result as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the conformal affine parameter for null geodesics in the background and @xmath17 is apparent position evaluated at the observed redshift @xmath20 please note that ( @xmath21 ) is used for apparent values of any quantity and apparent values are evaluated using the background equations .",

    "the perturbed conformal photon four - vector is also @xmath22 .",
    "the metric in a general gauge is written as @xmath23    typically , the observer fixes the scale factor at his observation time by @xmath24 , while the global scale factor is simply @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the observer s proper time and the subscript @xmath27 refers to the observer .",
    "note that to first order , proper time is not affected by the peculiar velocity of the observer .",
    "we use the conformal newtonian gauge in which the metric is given by @xmath28 in the matter dominated einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe where there is no anisotropic stress , we have @xmath29 . in this frame work ,",
    "the scale factor difference between the global scale factor @xmath30 and the @xmath31 is @xmath32 because this expressions are correct up to first order , @xmath3 refers to the global scale factor in our notation . before discussing cosmic rulers , it is helpful to mention the main points of deriving the equation ( [ res ] ) .",

    "the first term @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 @xcite . + to address the problem of consistency of derivation , we calculate the effect of a pure gradient mode on @xmath74 . in the eds universe",
    "a pure gradient mode is @xmath76 . in the newtonian gauge , the scalar @xmath74 yields @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79s .",

    "the magnification which produces area perturbations is measured in the lensing surveys and surveys which probe the luminosity like supernova surveys .",
    "it is related to angular and luminosity distance by @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the pure gradient will also induce no asymmetry in standard candle observations since its contribution to the magnification vanishes .",
    "one of the important observable quantities in the large scale structure surveys is the galaxy number count .",
    "similarly , we stress that the effect a gradient mode should vanishes naturally in a consistent derivation . along this line",

    "however , they will produce a squeezed bi - spectrum by modulation of power spectrum through gravitational coupling in the coordinates where long mode is present . because we derived a consistency condition for the gradient modes in terms of modulation of the power spectrum",
    ", we expect their effect vanish in local coordinates . here",
    ", we use a different transformation than @xcite and required the same physical scale in local coordinates . as halo formation",
    "is a local phenomena we argue that our transformation is sufficient for capturing the local effects .",
    "+ on large scales , there are other complexities since gauge effects become important .",
    "changing the gauge will produce scale dependencies in the bias .",
    "thus , one needs to find a relativistic definition for the bias .",
    "the synchronous gauge is shown to be the right gauge @xcite . since",
    "halo formation is a local phenomena , it only depends on the dark matter perturbations in this gauge .",
    "this gauge has been implemented for writing the relativistic galaxy clustering .",
    "a relativistic bias has also been defined using fermi normal coordinates and it is shown that it reduces to the usual bias on small scales @xcite . +      finally , we compute the effect of the pure gradient mode on the observed power spectrum",
    ". we can compute the intrinsic power spectrum in a chosen gauge and transform it back to the redshift space using the equations in @xcite .",
    "this equation is given by @xmath162 where @xmath163 since @xmath164 and @xmath165 do not change by the pure gradients , the observed large scale power spectrum is not modified .",
    "our aim in this paper is two fold .",
    "first , we emphasize that the effect of a gradient mode on observables should vanish , providing that the derivation is consistent . in this manner",
    ", we extend the investigation of the long mode modulations to other large scale observables taking into account projection effects that are inherent in a consistent relativistic formulation of the large scale observables . in the relativistic formulation ,",
    "defining observables is crucial .",
    "these observables are gauge invariant quantities made of information on the past light cone .",
    "the measured value of these observables is different because of the inhomogeneity effects . as an example , the cosmic rulers are one observable with a known physical scale like the bao . their observed scale can be compared to their physical scale .",
    "the observables in the cosmic rulers can be presented in terms of a scalar , a vector and a tensor quantity .",
    "the relativistic formulation of observables yields that the effects of gradient modes vanishes on all cosmic ruler observables .",
    "the other important quantity in the relativistic formulation is the galaxy number counts .",
    "additionally , we show that different projection effects cancel each other as well , using the relativistic galaxy number counts .",
    "+ second , we emphasize that the effects of a gradient mode on the bias vanishes in a consistent bias formulation .",
    "it is important to note this is possible even though there is a coupling of gradient modes to short modes .",
    "that is non - gaussian corrections induced by gravitational coupling vanish . since the halo number density depends on the matter variance , we first derived a consistency condition for how the matter power spectrum is modulated in the presence of a long gradient mode .",
    "as halo formation is a local phenomena , we used local coordinates to define the matter variance .",
    "this yields that the matter variance does not change in local coordinates .",
    "this confirms that the definition ( [ halo ] ) is consistent with equivalence principle .",
    "+ the vanishing effect of gradient modes is favored by the equivalence principle .",
    "it is shown that the local physical effects of long mode perturbations start at @xmath166 order if one uses conformal fermi coordinates as implied by the equivalence principle @xcite . as a result",
    ", the pure gradient mode does not contribute to the tidal term at linear order .",
    "however , to calculate the observables at late times , we have to transform from the conformal fermi coordinates to the observed coordinates .",
    "the gradient mode should vanish in a consistent general relativistic formulation .",
