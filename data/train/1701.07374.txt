    "chains of amino acids are important components of biological cells , and for such chains the specific ordering of the amino acids is often so fundamental to the resulting function and stability of the folded chain that if major deviations from the correct ordering were to occur , the final chain could fail to perform its requisite function within the cell , proving fatal to the organism .    more specifically , we see the relevance of correct ordering in the study of protein structure , which is often divided into the protein folding and protein design problem . while the protein _ folding _ problem concerns finding the three - dimensional structure associated with a given amino acid sequence , the protein _ design _ problem ( also termed the inverse - folding problem ; see figure [ fig : design ] ) concerns finding the correct amino acid sequence associated with a given protein structure . +        an aspect of one solution to the protein design problem is to maximize the energy difference between the low - energy folded native structure and the higher energy misfolded / denatured structures . in doing so",
    ", one takes native structure as fixed and then determines the sequence yielding the minimum energy , under the assumption ( termed the `` fixed amino - acid composition '' assumption ) that only certain quantities of amino - acids appear in the chain @xcite . in this resolution ( specifically termed heteropolymer models @xcite @xcite )",
    "the correct amino acid sequence is found by implementing an mc algorithm in sequence space given a certain fixed amino acid composition .",
    "this entails assuming the number of various types of amino acids does not change , and distinct states in sequence space are permutations of one another .",
    "for example , for a polypeptide chain with @xmath0 residues , rather than searching over the entire sequence space ( of size @xmath1 ) , one searches over a space of sequences ( of size @xmath2 ) which are defined by a fixed number of each amino acid .",
    "this aspect of the protein design problem alerts one to a gap in the statistical mechanics literature .",
    "namely , there do not seem to be any simple and analytically soluble statistical mechanics models where the space of states is defined by permutations of a list of components .",
    "we can take steps toward constructing such a model by considering reasonable general properties it should have .",
    "if we assume there was a specific sequence of components which defined the lowest energy sequence and was thermodynamically stable in the model , then deviations from this sequence would be less stable . because of the role sequences of molecules play in biological systems",
    ", it is worth asking what features we expect such sequences to have from the perspective of modeling in statistical mechanics .    in section",
    "ii we introduce the model , and compute an exact partition function which displays what we term ",
    "quasi \"- phase transitions  a transition in which the sequence of lowest energy becomes entropically disfavored above a certain temperature . in section iii , we extend the previous model by adding a quadratic mean field interaction term and show that the resulting system displays two transition temperatures , a triple point , and a quadruple point . in section iv , we discuss various ways we can extend this model in theoretical or more phenomenological directions .",
    "our larger goal is to study equilibrium thermodynamics for a system defined by permutations of a set of @xmath0 components where each unique permutation is defined by a specific energy . in general",
    ", we should consider the case where the set of @xmath0 components consists of @xmath3 types of components for which if @xmath4 is the number of repeated components of type @xmath5 , then @xmath6 . for simplicity",
    ", however , we will take @xmath7 for all @xmath5 so that each component is of a unique type and @xmath8 .    to study the equilibrium thermodynamics of such a system with a fixed @xmath0 at a fixed temperature @xmath9",
    ", we need to compute its partition function .",
    "for example , for a sequence with @xmath0 components ( with no components repeated ) , there are @xmath10 microstates the system can occupy and assuming we label each state @xmath11 , and associate an energy @xmath12 with each state , then the partition function would be @xmath13 where @xmath14 for each state @xmath5 could be reasoned from a more precise microscopic theory of how the components interact with one another .",
    "phenomenologically , eq . would be the most precise way to construct a model to study the equilibrium properties of permutations , but because it bears no clear mathematical structure , it is unenlightening from a theoretical perspective .",
    "+ instead we will postulate a less precise , but theoretically more interesting model . for",
    "most ordered chains in biological cells , there is a single sequence of components which is the ",
    "correct \" sequence for a particular macrostructure .",
    "deviations from this correct sequence are often disfavored because they form less stable macrostructures or they fail to perform the original function of the  correct \" sequence . with the general properties of such sequences in mind , we will abstractly represent our system as consisting of @xmath0 sites which are filled with particular coordinate values denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "that is , we have an arbitrary but fixed coordinate vector @xmath16 expressed in component form as @xmath17 we will take the collection of components @xmath18 as intrinsic to our system , and thus take the state space of our system to be the set of all the vectors whose ordering of components can be obtained by permuting the components of @xmath16 , i.e. , all permutations of @xmath19 .",
    "we represent an arbitrary state in this state space as @xmath20 , where the @xmath21 are drawn without repeat from @xmath18 .",
    "formally , we would say our space of states is isomorphic to the symmetric group on @xmath16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will thus denote our state space as @xmath22 and then an arbitrary state @xmath23 is just an element element of this set .",
    "+ as a first formulation of the model , we will take @xmath24 ( the correct sequence ) to represent the zero energy state in the system , and for each component @xmath25 of an arbitrary vector @xmath23 which differs from the corresponding component @xmath26 in @xmath16 , there is an energy cost of @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are components of vectors @xmath23 and @xmath16 respectively , and @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 we note that although we label our general state as @xmath20 , the components @xmath33 can only take on mutually - exclusive values from the set @xmath34 . + we want to explore the equilibrium thermodynamics of a system with a hamiltonian of eq .. this amounts to calculating the partition function @xmath35 where @xmath36 is again the set of all permutations of the components of @xmath37 . to find a closed form expression for the partition function , we group terms in eq .",
    "according to the number of ways to completely reorder @xmath38 components in @xmath16 while keeping the remaining components fixed .",
    "each such reordering ( i.e. , each value of @xmath38 ) is associated with a sum over products of @xmath39 terms with @xmath38 factors of @xmath39 ( for various @xmath40 ) in each term .",
    "the total partition function is a sum of all such reorderings for all @xmath38s from @xmath41 to @xmath0 . as can be seen from a direct expansion of eq . , we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 , termed the number of derangements of a list of @xmath38 ( @xcite ) , is the number of ways to completely reorder a list of @xmath38 elements .",
    "the quantity @xmath44 , termed the @xmath38th elementary symmetric polynomial on @xmath45 ( @xcite ) , is the sum of all ways to multiply @xmath38 elements out of the @xmath0 term set @xmath46 .",
    "for example , @xmath47 . by definition @xmath48_{q",
    "= 0}.\\ ] ] by the definition of the incomplete gamma function as @xmath49 and its relation to derangements ( i.e. , @xmath50 , see @xcite ) , we then find @xmath51 , \\label{eq : partfunc001}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the desired closed - form expression for the partition function of this system .",
    "+ with eq . , the problem of abstractly studying a thermal system of permutations with hamiltonian eq .",
    "is , from the perspective of equilibrium statistical mechanics , now complete .",
    "however , there are still some physical and theoretical results which can be teased from this formalism .",
    "specifically , we can ask whether this system exhibits phase transitions . to answer this question ,",
    "it would prove more analytically tractable to take @xmath52 for all @xmath40 . with this condition , our partition function simplifies to @xmath53 where we transformed our hamiltonian as @xmath54 with @xmath38 , defined as @xmath55 the number of components of @xmath23 which are not equal to the corresponding component in @xmath16 .",
    "we call @xmath38 the number of _ incorrect _ components of @xmath23 , and if @xmath56 we say @xmath23 is _ completely disordered_. the factor @xmath57 in eq .",
    "is defined as @xmath58 is the number of ways to reorder a list of @xmath0 elements so that @xmath38 elements are no longer in their original position .",
    "this combinatorial definition of @xmath57 will prove useful when we explore the phase behavior of more complex models of permutations .    from the form of eq .",
    ", it is clear that , physically , its associated hamiltonian is not realistic as it places distinct permutations ( which in any true physical system most likely have quite different energy properties ) in the same degenerate energy state .",
    "still , from a theoretical perspective , the simplicity of this model makes it a suitable starting point for studying the general properties of systems of permutations .",
    "we can investigate the phase - like behavior of the system defined by the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( for constant @xmath59 across @xmath40 ) , by applying steepest descent to eq . in the @xmath60 limit .",
    "doing so , we find we can approximate the free energy of the system to be @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a @xmath63 independent constant . noting that @xmath64 , we find the average number of incorrect components satisfies the following equation of state : @xmath65 by eq . , we can infer that @xmath66 must be greater than or equal to 0 .",
    "however , the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "exhibits no such explicit constraint .",
    "thus we can infer there is a phase - like transition in our system at the temperature @xmath67 below this temperature , we must have @xmath68 and thus the  correct permutation \" has the lowest free energy and is thermodynamically favored ; above this temperature , @xmath69 and the system is in a disordered phase where the previous lowest energy  correct - permutation \" is energetically disfavored .",
    "+ interestingly , this transition arises from the naively non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath70 we say  naively non - interacting \" because eq .",
    "consists of a sum over linear functions of a single index @xmath40 , and thus does not suggest any coupling between terms of differing index .",
    "however , statistical mechanics tells us that the energy of a system is nt the only thing which determines the thermodynamic behavior of a system .",
    "indeed we have to consider entropic contributions as well , and in this system the entropy ( as it is a function of @xmath38 ) can drive thermodynamic behavior . in other words , although the hamiltonian is depicted as non - interacting and can set - theoretically be represented as @xmath71 our system really exhibits interactions between components because our total space of states @xmath72 can not be factorized : @xmath73 thus the  non - interacting \" system exhibits a transition at eq . due to the coupled nature of the state space . as discussed in the subsequent section , we term this transition a  quasi - phase transition \" because it does not bear all of the standard properties we expect in phase transitions .      , the landau free energy of the system as a function of @xmath38 , the number of incorrect components in @xmath23 , is always convex with a single global minimum . because @xmath74 , the @xmath75 domain of each plot ( dashed section ) is inaccessible . for sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the minimum is at @xmath76 , but as we increase the temperature beyond eq .",
    ", the free energy curve moves to the right ( but retains its functional form ) and the new minimum is at a @xmath77 value .",
    "actual plots of eq . for",
    "@xmath75 require us to replace the combinatorial argument of the logarithm with its corresponding gamma function expression . ]",
    "we claim the system does not exhibit true phase transition behavior because many of these results are not consistent with the traditional thermodynamic definition of phase transitions .",
    "for one , phase transitions are associated with divergences in the derivatives of the free energy , but there is no divergence in the free energy associated with the partition function eq . for possible parameter values .",
    "also , the result eq",
    ". arises from the steepest descent approximation which makes @xmath78 s temperature dependence near @xmath79 appear non - differentiable when by eq .",
    "it is actually differentiable over its entire domain . finally , with eq .",
    "we can define a landau free energy @xmath80 for this system according to @xmath81 , and what we may ordinarily label as a phase transition ( i.e. , going from @xmath82 to @xmath83 ) arises , not from changes in the functional form of the landau free energy as we see in real phase transitions , but from changes in the excluded region of the landau free energy ( see figure [ fig : perm_nonint_freeenergy ] ) . because the functional form of the free energy remains the same we observe no true phase transition .",
    "alternatively , a heuristic argument for the non - existence of phase transitions in our permutation model is mathematically very similar to the landau argument ( @xcite ) for the non - existence of transitions in 1d ising models . for our permutation system with @xmath0 lattice sites ,",
    "the state of zero energy and zero entropy consists of every site being occupied by its correct component . to increase the energy of this system",
    ", we can choose @xmath38 sites to contain incorrect components , thus giving us an energy @xmath84 .",
    "the number of ways we can choose these @xmath38 components is given by eq .",
    "thus , upon introducing @xmath85 incorrect components , the change in the landau free energy of our system is @xmath86    \\simeq j ( \\lambda_0   - k_bt   \\ln n ) ,   \\label{eq : freeen_0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we took these results in the @xmath87 limit and used @xmath88 . in the thermodynamic ( @xmath89 )",
    "limit , we find that @xmath90 meaning there is no non - zero @xmath9 at which the entropic contribution becomes subdominant to the energy .",
    "thus the system exhibits no phase transition .",
    "when we first considered a model of thermal permutations , we began with a hamiltonian where sites did not interact with one another and each had a site - dependent energy cost for being incorrectly occupied : @xmath91 more generally , we can consider hamiltonians with an arbitrary number of multiple - site interaction terms .",
    "such a hamiltonian could be written as @xmath92 the first term in eq .",
    "associates an energy cost of @xmath59 with incorrectly occupying the component at position @xmath40 .",
    "the second term models interactions between sites where the correct ( or incorrect ) occupation of a single site determines the energy of another .",
    "the exact values of @xmath59 and @xmath93 could be chosen to ensure the ",
    "correct \" state ( @xmath94 for all @xmath40 ) is non - degenerate as in the non - interacting model .",
    "the ellipses represent higher order interactions in this framework .",
    "hamiltonians such as eq . should be more physically relevant as they would correspond to systems where the energy cost for deviating from the lowest energy permutation is not simply linear but could be represented as a tensor valued fitting function .",
    "we can make progress in studying the thermodynamics of more general hamiltonians like eq . by first only considering first- and second - order interaction terms and taking the interactions to be constants : @xmath95 for all @xmath40 ; @xmath96 for all @xmath97 .",
    "the factor of @xmath98 is chosen so that the second term matches the extensive scaling of the first term .",
    "the partition function for such parameter selections is then @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are interaction parameters with units of energy .",
    "we can also write this partition function in the eq .",
    "basis as @xmath102 where @xmath57 is defined in eq .",
    "and @xmath103 is the energy function for the system .",
    "our goal is to analyze the  quasi \"- phase behavior of this system in a way analogous to our analysis for the non - interacting system .",
    "to do so we begin with the landau free energy function @xmath104 alternative starting points for this derivation are presented in appendix [ app : alt_deriv ] .",
    "our system is constitutively discrete , so it is not precisely correct to discuss our free energy in the language of analysis , but given our expression for eq .",
    "we can map this system to a continuous one which bears the same thermodynamic properties and for which analysis is appropriate . specifically , if we take @xmath38 to be continuous and use the identity @xmath105 , we can write @xmath106 with the approximation @xmath107 and the substitution eq . , eq",
    ". then becomes @xmath108 where we defined our approximated free energy as @xmath109 and collected the @xmath38 independent constants into @xmath110 .",
    "now eq . is fully continuous and amenable to analysis . to find the thermodynamic equilibrium of this system , we need to find the value of @xmath38 for which @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "for the first condition we have @xmath113 for @xmath114 we have @xmath115 as can be affirmed by taylor expansion or plots of each side . since the argument of @xmath116 is bounded below by 1 , the approximation in eq",
    "can be applied to eq .. with this substitution , and setting the result to be valid for the equilibrium value @xmath117 , we then find the constraint @xmath118 which has the solution @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the ( branch unspecified ) lambert w function , defined by @xmath121 to specify the branch of the @xmath120 which corresponds to a stable equilibrium we compute the second derivative of our free energy at this derived critical point .",
    "doing so yields @xmath122 thus eq .",
    "( for @xmath123 ) yields a free energy minimum for @xmath124 and yields a maximum for the inverse condition .",
    "this amounts to stating that the stable equilibrium for @xmath125 is defined by the principal branch of the lambert w function where @xmath126 , and the unstable equilibrium for @xmath125 is defined by the negative branch where @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the order parameter for this system is @xmath128 we note that taking @xmath129 and using @xmath130 for @xmath131 returns us to the non - interacting result eq ..    for completeness , we define the value of @xmath38 which yields a free energy maximum as @xmath132 ; it is related to eq . by replacing the principal branch function @xmath133 with @xmath134 .      in the previous section",
    ", we found that the order parameter for this system was given by eq .. we noted that this solution represented a local minimum of the free energy as long as the lambert w function satisfied @xmath135 .",
    "thus when this condition is violated , @xmath136 is no longer a valid stable equilibrium , and our system has undergone a  quasi",
    "\"- phase transition or simply a transition .",
    "moreover , our values of @xmath38 are bounded below by @xmath76 and bounded above by @xmath137 , neither conditions of which are naturally constrained by eq .. thus these two conditions are associated with two other transitions . in all , then , there are three conditions which define the quasi - phase boundaries in this system .",
    "while there are three conditions which define transitions in this system , there are in fact five distinct regimes of parameter space .",
    "we can obtain a qualitative sense of these regimes by creating schematic plots of the free energy eq .",
    "for various parameter values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the possible plots can be placed into five categories according to the plot s stable or metastable @xmath38 values .",
    "we depict these possible plots in figure [ fig : free_en ] .",
    "we note that only the free energy plots with valid values of @xmath136 contain what we normally consider a thermodynamic equilibrium ; the other plots have  stable \" values of @xmath38 arising only from the @xmath76 and/or @xmath56 boundary conditions .",
    "qualitatively , we can name the states according to the sequence space to which their equilibrium values of @xmath38 correspond .",
    "we know for @xmath76 , our system is in a state with zero incorrect components in @xmath23 and hence the system is  perfectly ordered `` or just ' ' ordered \" .",
    "conversely for @xmath56 our system has @xmath0 incorrect components and hence the system is  completely disordered \" or just  disordered \" .",
    "the in - between case of @xmath117 where @xmath138 can be given the related label of  partially - ordered \" .",
    "thus , the regime names associated with our possible values of the order parameters are    * * ordered regime * * ( @xmath139 stable ) * : neither @xmath140 or @xmath132 exist ; @xmath141 .",
    "* * disordered regime * * ( @xmath142 stable ) * : neither @xmath140 or @xmath132 exist ; @xmath143 . * * partially - ordered regime * * ( @xmath144 stable ) * : only @xmath136 exists . * * order and disorder metastable regime * * ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 stable ) * : only @xmath132 exists . * * order and partial - order metastable regime * * ( @xmath147 and @xmath148 stable ) * : both @xmath136 and @xmath132 exist .",
    "we note that it seems to be a fundamental feature ( or a lack of one ) of this system , that the free energy eq .",
    "does not admit a metastability between partial - order and disorder .      with these regime definitions",
    ", we can depict the parameter space graphically . in figure",
    "[ fig : free_en ] we showed the possible forms of the free energy for this system where each was categorized according to the existence of the local minimum critical point @xmath136 , the existence of the local maximum critical point @xmath132 , and the sign of the quantity @xmath109 .",
    "we can extrapolate this categorization to @xmath149 parameter space , by determining which regions of parameter space correspond to specific plots in eq .. doing so through the monte carlo procedure described in appendix [ app : mcpro ] , we generated 10,000 points of the parameter space diagram in figure [ fig : phase_diagram5 ] for @xmath150 set to 1 .",

    "when interactions are introduced through a quadratic mean field term , the system is capable of exhibiting five regimes of thermal behavior , and is characterized by two transition - temperatures corresponding to various quasi - phase transitions .",
    "the introduced model provides us with a basic exactly soluble system for certain interaction assumptions and thus provides a concrete model - based understanding of a system with a non - factorizable state space .",
    "because of its utility and the type of results obtained , the model deserves to be subject to the standard extensions of typical canonical models in statistical mechanics .",
    "in particular we hope to extend it to non - trivial site dependent interactions .",
    "for example , a nearest neighbor interaction hamiltonian of the kind which characterize the ising model , @xmath158 would be an alternative physical extreme to the mean - field interactions considered in section [ sec : three ] .",
    "we could also consider a generalized chain of components where the interactions between sites or the cost for an incorrectly filled site is not constant but is drawn from a distribution of values .",
    "such a system of quenched disorder would characterize a permutation glass which may contain interesting results due to the unique nature of the state space .",

    "this condition is where the @xmath136 and @xmath211 begin coexisting @xcite , thus creating the mutual existence of a local maxima and local minima in figure [ fig : free_en ] .",

    "<S> such a non - factorizable state space is quite different from the state spaces typically considered in statistical physics systems and consequently has novel behavior in systems with interacting and even non - interacting hamiltonians . </S>",
