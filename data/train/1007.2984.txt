    "at present , one of the most commonly used effective theories of quantum chromodynamics is the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , a local relativistic four - fermion interaction theory .",
    "the qcd and njl lagrangians possess the same symmetry group , the njl model is therefore widely exploited in studying the nonperturbative qcd vacuum and its properties under various external conditions .",
    "many features of quarks and light mesons can be successfully described within the njl model on the basis of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking phenomenon @xcite .",
    "considering the qcd ground state properties , a number of studies were dedicated to the possibility of formation of spatially nonuniform phases in dense quark matter .",
    "it was first shown  @xcite that spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic chiral condensation may occur in qcd at asymptotically high values of the chemical potential and large @xmath0 , the ground state spatial structure taking the form of a standing wave .",
    "this phenomenon was further discussed in literature @xcite investigating the possibility of such type of symmetry breaking and its competition with color superconductivity under various conditions including intermediate densities of quark matter .",
    "the problem has also been examined recently in the context of quarkyonic matter @xcite . along with qcd studies ,",
    "similar behavior of the ground state has also been discovered and successfully reproduced in njl - like effective models @xcite , although the effect tends to be dependent on the adopted regularization scheme ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "spatially nonuniform condensates proposed at the start of the theoretical research on the subject @xcite and studied extensively later on are known as dual chiral density waves ( dcdw , the name introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the corresponding configuration can be described as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the chiral density amplitude , @xmath3 is a wave vector ( which has to be determined dynamically along with @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 are the isospin pauli matrices .",
    "expectation values @xmath6 and @xmath7 are identified with @xmath8 and @xmath9 condensates ; one generally assumes @xmath10 , thus charged @xmath11 condensates being absent . in general , scalar and pseudoscalar condensates are on the chiral circle : @xmath12 .",
    "it is argued ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) that dcdw may arise between the massive and symmetric phases of the njl model at low temperatures if the coupling constant is sufficiently large .",
    "the formation of dcdw along with color superconductivity has also been discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "it should be noted however that , although the majority of studies of condensate inhomogeneity focus on wavelike configurations and dcdw in particular , this is mainly for technical reasons .",
    "there may exist other competing and even more preferable spatially nonuniform ground state configurations like domain walls , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , but , in general , they are much harder to deal with . for the same technical reasons",
    ", one usually considers the limit of vanishing quark current masses ( chiral limit ) , although recently efforts to get rid of this assumption have been made @xcite .    the chiral condensation phenomenon ( with spatially homogeneous condensate configurations )",
    "has recently attracted great attention in the situation when external gauge fields and , in particular , strong magnetic fields are present @xcite .",
    "in fact these fields are common in the physical circumstances where the phase structure of quark matter is of interest , e.g. , in compact stars or in heavy - ion collision processes @xcite . the effect of magnetic fields on the spatially nonuniform chiral condensation is therefore worth investigation .",

    "@xcite ( see also ref .",

    ", we have only reported our results for the case of cold quark matter , and the role of finite temperature is to be studied in our forthcoming publications .",

    "@xcite ) , a challenging self - consistent problem may arise with the magnetic field being generated dynamically .",
    "one should also consider the color superconductivity phenomenon possible along with the chiral density waves formation ; the results obtained in such generalized models seem to be less regularization dependent  @xcite .",
    "a nonzero quark current mass should be taken into account as well .",
    "besides , concerning the ground state spatial configuration of the njl model , it has been argued that domain walls may be more preferable than chiral density waves at least in the absence of external gauge fields @xcite . at the same time , as it may be concluded from our calculations , one would expect that a strong magnetic field favors the formation of dcdw .",
    "thus , there should exist some solution interpolating between the two extremes in the intermediate region of the magnetic field strength , possibly being similar to the solution discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , a competing mechanism for domain walls formation in a strong magnetic field",
    "has also been discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "therefore , the problem of the preferred ground state spatial structure requires further theoretical investigation but , in general , it has been shown that an external magnetic field induces condensate inhomogeneity , in the form of dcdw or some more preferable configuration .",
    "another subject of research is obtaining analytical expressions for the order parameters as functions of the external conditions in a weak magnetic field at least in some special cases using an approach similar to that adopted , e.g. , in ref .",

    "our concluding remark is that real existence of a spatially nonuniform chiral condensate in nature is yet an open question since theoretical results related to the problem are generally model and approximation dependent .",
    "unfortunately , exact qcd calculation of its production is impossible , since this is an infrared phenomenon .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that the theoretical research of this kind of nonperturbative effects will yield our better understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter .",
