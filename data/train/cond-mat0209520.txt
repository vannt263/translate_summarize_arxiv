    "spin polarized transport has recently been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental interest.@xcite the mismatch of spin currents at the interface between two ferromagnetic ( f ) electrodes with antiparallel spin polarizations produces a larger contact resistance than a junction with parallel polarizations , leading to tunneling magnetoresistance in f - f junctions@xcite and giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) in multilayer structures.@xcite systems displaying gmr have shown other magnetotransport effects including substantial magnetothermopower @xcite with a strong temperature dependence .",
    "thermoelectric effects have also been discussed in the context of spin injection across a ferromagnetic - paramagnetic junction.@xcite    the mott formula@xcite @xmath9 relates the thermopower @xmath10 of a system to the derivative with respect to energy of the electrical conductivity , @xmath11 , near the fermi energy , @xmath12 , so that , in metals , @xmath10 typically contains a small parameter such as @xmath13 . in magnetic multilayers with highly transparent interfaces ,",
    "the mott formula has been used as a basis for theories of transport that explain the origin of the magnetothermopower effect as due to either the difference in the energy dependence of the density of states for majority and minority spin bands in ferromagnetic layers,@xcite or a different efficiency of electron - magnon scattering for carriers in opposite spin states.@xcite in particular , the electron - magnon interaction in a ferromagnetic layer was incorporated to explain the observation @xcite of a strong temperature dependence of @xmath14 and gave , theoretically , a much larger thermopower in the parallel configuration of multilayers with highly transparent interfaces than in the antiparallel one , @xmath15 . for tunnel junctions , magnon - assisted processes have been studied both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite with a view to relate nonlinear @xmath16 characteristics to the density of states of magnons @xmath17 as @xmath18 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a model of the electron - magnon interaction assisted thermopower in a mesoscopic size ferromagnet / insulator / ferromagnet tunnel junction , which yields a different prediction .",
    "the bottle - neck of both charge and heat transport lies in a small - area tunnel contact between ferromagnetic metals held at different temperatures .",
    "the thermopower is generated in the course of thermal equilibration between two baths of magnons as mediated by electrons , and , in the relatively high resistance antiparallel ( ap ) configuration of a ferromagnetic tunnel junction , it depends on the difference between the size of the majority and minority band fermi surfaces . for a momentum - conserving tunneling model",
    "we find that @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21(@xmath22 ) is the area of the maximal cross - section of the fermi surface of majority ( minority ) electrons in the plane parallel to the interface ( @xmath23 ) .",

    "the magnetothermopower effect is most pronounced in the case of half - metallic ferromagnets , where the exchange spin splitting @xmath27 between the majority and minority conduction bands is greater than the fermi energy @xmath28 measured from the bottom of the majority band , and the fermi density of states in the minority band is zero . in the antiparallel configuration of such a junction , where the emission / absorption of a magnon would lift the spin - blockade of electronic transfer between ferromagnetic metals ,",
    "we predict a large thermopower effect , whereas in the lower - resistance parallel configuration thermopower is relatively weak:@xcite @xmath29 this is because the contribution of magnon - assisted transport to the thermopower in the parallel configuration @xmath6 is zero and the thermopower only arises from the energy dependence of the electronic density of states near the fermi energy .    the magnon - assisted processes that we consider are similar to those discussed in refs .   in relation to the magnon contribution to the nonlinear conductance . in a ferromagnetic tunnel junction in the antiparallel configuration , the elastic contribution to the conductance is suppressed by the mismatch of spin currents at the interface .",
    "however it is possible to lift spin current blockade while conserving the overall spin of the system by emitting or absorbing magnons .",
    "for example , the change of spin that occurs when a minority carrier flips and occupies a majority state is compensated by an opposite change of spin due to magnon emission . as a result",
