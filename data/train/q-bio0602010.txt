    "this numerical estimate was then compared to each of the six expressions outlined above . in this scan , _",

    "those values were obtained from a recent study ( rudolph et al . , 2005 ) , in which the synaptic noise was analyzed from intracellular recordings of neurons in cat parietal cortex _ in vivo_. this analysis used both classic conductance analysis methods , the extended expression _",

    "rd2005 _ was the best estimate for about 95% of the parameter sets .",
    "manual examination of the cases for which _ rd2005 _ was not the best estimate revealed that this happened when both time constants were slow ( `` slow synapses '' ; decay time constants @xmath350  ms ) .",
    "an example of such distribution is shown in fig .",
    "s-2 . in this case , the static - noise limit _ ll2006 * _ was the best estimate , followed by _",
    "rd2005_.    to explore this region of parameters , we performed two additional runs of 5,000 randomly selected values of parameters , contrasting a region of parameter with fast time constants with the same region with slow time constants . when time constants were fast , _",
    "rd2005 _ , _",
    "rd2005 * _ and _ m2004 _ accounted for the best performance ( fig .",
    "s-3a ) , in agreement with above . however , for slow time constants , the most accurate estimate was obtained by using the static noise limit ( fig .",
    "s-3b ; identical run as fig .",
    "1f of the paper ) .",
    "the performance of static noise limit is not surprising since this expression is specific for systems with infinitely large noise time constants .",
    "a last run was realized using a wider parameter range ( fig .",
    "s-4 ) , that included physiological values , as well as slow synapses and strong conductances .",
    "the parameter space scanned included all regions of parameters scanned in all preceding runs .",
    "based on a set of 10,000 parameter values randomly chosen within this parameter space , the _",
    "expression still provided the largest number of best estimates ( about 50% of the cases ) , followed by the static - noise limit _ ll2006 * _ ( 37% ) .",
    "similar values were obtained by removing _",
    "rd2005 * _ from the analysis ( fig .",
    "s-4b ) .    based on these runs ,",
    "we conclude that , for physiologically - relevant parameter values , the extended expression _",
    "rd2005 _ is the most accurate for about 80 - 90% of the cases . outside of this range",
    ", however , the situation is different .",
    "the static noise limit can be a better approximation for systems with large noise time constants ( `` slow synapses '' ) , and should be used in such cases .",
    "all simulations above and in the paper were done under the neuron simulation environment ( hines & carnevale , 1997 ) .",
    "the neuron source code that was used for the simulations shown here , as well as the code for data analysis and drawings , can be found at the following location : +   + this code contains two parts .",
    "first , a scanning program runs the numeric simulations for the 10,000 parameters , and writes the results to a data file .",
    "second , an analysis / drawing program reads this data file and creates the histograms shown in fig .  1 . the user can easily change the parameters and verify the simulations shown here , or perform scans in unexplored parameter ranges , and thereby contribute to a more rich analysis of how the different analytic expressions fit numeric simulations .",
    "note that , contrary to the previous papers ( rudolph & destexhe , 2003 , 2005 ) , no boundary conditions were used here , and the codes provided allow the conductance to go negative .",
    "similar results were obtained when boundary conditions were used ( this is easy to modify in the code provided ) .",
    "finally , another test of the analytic expressions is by comparing them directly to experimental data .",
    "the _ rd2005 _",
    "expression is the basis of a recently proposed method to analyze intracellular recordings by fitting experimental distributions , yielding estimates of parameters of the real synaptic noise , such as the mean and variance of excitatory and inhibitory conductances ( rudolph et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "this method is presently used by several laboratories around the world .",
    "related to the present paper , the _ rd2005 _",
    "expression was tested against experimental data , in different ways .",
    "first , the conductances obtained by using the _ rd2005_-based method were compared to other methods for conductance analysis , as well as to the direct matching of computational models to experimental data .",
    "these different methods yielded consistent results for activated states recorded intracellularly in cat parietal cortex _ in vivo _",
    "( see rudolph et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that _ rd2005 _ is accurate for the parameters corresponding to this type of synaptic noise in cortical neurons _ in vivo _",
    "( indeed those are the parameters shown in fig .",
    "s-1 ) .    a second test , more severe , was realized using the dynamic - clamp technique .",
    "the synaptic noise produced spontaneously in ferret cortical slices ( `` up - states '' ) was analyzed using _ rd2005 _",
    ", yielding estimates of the conductance parameters . an artificial synaptic noise",
    "was then generated using the estimated parameters , and was re - injected in the _ same neuron _ during quiescent activity using dynamic - clamp .",
    "this yields a `` recreated '' state that can be compared to the `` natural '' state .",
    "this procedure was successful , as shown by the matching of the natural and artificial v@xmath0 distributions ( see fig .",
    "7 and fig .",
    "8a in rudolph et al . ,",
    "another test , equally severe , was to first inject synaptic noise with known parameters , and then compare the v@xmath0 distribution obtained in the real neuron with the analytic prediction of _",
    "rd2005_. this procedure also yielded consistent estimates ( fig .",
    "8b in rudolph et al . ,",
    "2004 ) .",
    "these experiments and analyses show that the extended expression _",

    "other expressions could possibly be used in similar paradigms , but this has not been done yet .",

    "<S> this system was investigated by using stochastic calculus to obtain analytic expressions for the steady - state membrane potential ( v@xmath0 ) distribution ( rudolph & destexhe , 2003 ; 2005 ) . </S>",
    "<S> analytic expressions can also be obtained for the moments of the underlying three - dimensional fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) ( richardson , 2004 ) , or by considering this equation under different limit cases ( lindner & longtin , 2006 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the greatest promises of such analytic expressions is that they can be used to deduce the characteristics of conductance fluctuations from intracellular recordings _ in vivo _ </S>",
    "<S> ( rudolph et al . , 2004 ; 2005 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a recent article ( lindner & longtin , 2006 ) provided an in - depth analysis of some of these expressions , as well as different analytically - exact limit cases . </S>",
    "<S> one of the conclusions of this analysis was that the original expression provided by rudolph & destexhe ( 2003 ) was derived using steps that were incorrect for colored noise , and that the expression obtained matches numerical simulations only for restricted ranges of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the latter conclusion was in agreement with the analysis provided in rudolph & destexhe ( 2005 ) . </S>",
    "<S> another conclusion was that the `` extended expression '' proposed by rudolph & destexhe ( 2005 ) , although providing an excellent fit to v@xmath0 distributions in general , does not match for some parameter values and in particular , it does not agree with the analytically - exact static - noise limit . </S>",
    "<S> this extended expression is therefore not an exact solution of the system either . </S>",
    "<S> since several analytic expressions were provided for the steady - state v@xmath0 distribution ( rudolph & destexhe , 2003 ; richardson , 2004 ; rudolph & destexhe , 2005 ; lindner & longtin , 2006 ) , and since all of these expressions are either approximations or limit cases , it is not clear how they compare and which expression should be used in a given situation . in particular , it is unclear which expression should be used to analyze experimental recordings . in the present note , we attempt to answer these questions by clarifying a number of points about some of the previous expressions , and by providing a detailed comparison of the different expressions available in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we would like to clarify a number of misleading statements we made in the original article ( rudolph & destexhe , 2003 ) , and which may lead to confusion . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper was to obtain an analytic expression for the steady - state v@xmath0 distribution of membranes subject to conductance - based colored noise sources . to obtain this , we considered the full system under a @xmath1 limit . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , we noted that the noise time constants become infinitesimally small compared to the time over which the system is considered , and this property allowed us to treat the system as for white noise . </S>",
    "<S> our main assumption was that this procedure would allow us to obtain the correct steady - state properties like the v@xmath0 distribution . </S>",
    "<S> our approach was to obtain a simplified fpe which gives the same steady - state solutions as the fpe describing the full system . </S>",
    "<S> these assumptions were stated in the results of rudolph & destexhe ( 2003 ) , but were not clearly stated in the abstract and discussion , and it could be understood that we claimed to provide an fpe valid for the full system . </S>",
    "<S> we clarify here that the treatment followed in that paper did not intend to describe the full system , but was only restricted to steady - state solutions .    unlike the original expression ( rudolph & destexhe , 2003 ) , which matches only for a restricted range of parameters , the extended expression ( rudolph & destexhe , 2005 ) matches for several orders of magnitude of the parameters ( see also supplementary information of rudolph & destexhe , 2005 ) . </S>",
    "<S> why the extended expression matches so well , although it is not an exact solution of the system ( lindner & longtin , 2006 ) , is presently unknown . </S>",
    "<S> it is not due to the presence of boundary conditions , which could compensate for mismatches `` by chance '' . </S>",
    "<S> simulations with and without boundary conditions gave equally good fits for the parameters considered here ( see neuron code in supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> our interpretation ( rudolph & destexhe , 2005 ) is that the @xmath2 limit altered the spectral structure of the stochastic process ( filtering ) , and one can recover a better spectral structure by following the same approximation for a system that is solvable ( e.g. , that of richardson , 2004 ) and correct it accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as also found by lindner & longtin ( 2006 ) , the extended expression is a very good approximation of the steady - state v@xmath0 distribution . </S>",
    "<S> other expressions have been proposed under different approximations ( richardson , 2004 ) or limit cases ( lindner & longtin , 2006 ) and also match well the simulations for the applicable range of parameters .    since </S>",
    "<S> different expressions were proposed corresponding to different approximations ( rudolph & destexhe , 2003 , 2005 ; richardson , 2004 ; lindner & longtin , 2006 ) , we investigated which expression must be used in practical situations . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered an extended range of parameters and tested all expressions by running the model for 10,000 randomly - selected values within this parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this procedure are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a - d . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest error between analytic expressions and numerical simulations was found for the extended expression of rudolph & destexhe ( 2005 ) , followed by gaussian approximations of the same authors and that of richardson ( 2004 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth best approximation was the static - noise limit by lindner & longtin ( 2006 ) . by scanning only within physiologically - relevant values based on conductance measurements in cats _ in vivo _ </S>",
    "<S> ( rudolph et al . , 2005 ) , the same ranking was observed ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e ) , with even more drastic differences ( up to 95% ; see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> manual examination of the different parameter sets where the extended expression was not the best estimate revealed that this happened when both time constants were slow ( `` slow synapses '' ; decay time constants @xmath350  ms ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , performing parameter scans restricted to this region of parameters showed that the extended expression , while still providing good fits to the simulations , ranked first for less than 30% of the cases , while the static - noise limit was the best estimate for almost 50% of parameter sets ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1f ; see details in supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> scanning parameters within a wider range of values including fast / slow synapses and weak / strong conductances showed that the extended expression was still the best estimate ( about 47% ) , followed by the static - noise limit ( 37% ; see supplementary information ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have clarified here two main points . </S>",
    "<S> first , we clarified the assumptions and approximations that were too ambiguously stated in rudolph & destexhe ( 2003 ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , we provided a comparison of the different expressions available so far in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison showed that , for physiologically - relevant parameter values , the extended expression of rudolph & destexhe ( 2005 ) is the most accurate for about 80 - 90% of the cases . </S>",
    "<S> outside of this range , however , the situation may be different . in systems driven by slow noisy synaptic activity , </S>",
    "<S> the static - noise limit performed better . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that , for practical situations of realistic conductance values and synaptic time constants , the extended expression provides the most accurate alternative available . </S>",
    "<S> this is also supported by the fact that the extended was successfully tested in real neurons ( rudolph et al . </S>",
    "<S> , 2004 ) , which is perhaps the strongest evidence that this approach provides a powerful tool to analyze intracellular recordings . </S>"
