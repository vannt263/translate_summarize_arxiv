    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are massive helium burning stars , formed either through stellar wind mass loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or mass transfer in a binary system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations show that the majority of massive stars are in binary systems @xcite .",
    "the evolution of massive binaries plays a vital role in various aspects of astrophysics , and their evolutionary products are related to many interesting phenomena , e.g. type ib / c supernovae @xcite , high - mass x - ray binaries , and double compact star systems @xcite .",
    "mass transfer in a binary can dramatically influence the evolution of the system , changing the properties of both stars and the binary orbit . during the process of roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) , the primary star loses most of its hydrogen envelope , leaving a burning helium core , while mass accretion onto the secondary star causes it to rejuvenate and spin up @xcite .",
    "after the mass transfer , the binary evolves to be a wr+o system .",
    "however the mass transfer efficiency @xmath2 , i.e. , the fraction of the transferred mass that is accreted by the secondary , still remains uncertain .",
    "evolutionary calculations of massive binaries involving the formation of wr+o binaries have been performed by many authors , since the pioneering works by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the evolutionary scenario of massive close binaries with the primary mass between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and showed that the mass transfer efficiency @xmath2 is required to be less than 0.3 in order to reproduce the observations .",
    "@xcite investigated the evolutionary sequences of massive case b binary systems with primary masses @xmath5 with the assumption of @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite presented the evolution calculations of massive binaries with conservative mass transfer , they found that none of the observed wr+o binaries can fit the calculated results .",
    "@xcite explored the progenitor evolution of three wr+o binaries with the wr / o mass ratio of @xmath7 and the orbital periods of @xmath8 days , and concluded that the mass transfer must have be highly non - conservative .",
    "more recently , @xcite followed about @xmath9 binary evolutionary tracks with the primary mass of @xmath10 and the orbital period of @xmath11 days . by comparing",
    "the non - conservative models tend to better match the observed mass - transferring binaries in the small magellanic cloud . in our previous work @xcite , we evolved a large number of binary systems and adopted three different mass transfer models , from highly non - conservative to quasi - conservative , to derive the parameter spaces of avoiding the occurrence of contact binaries .",
    "we showed that , an efficiency of 0.5 is required to be consistent with the observed be / x - ray binaries with a neutron star , while the binary systems hosting a black - hole favors the less efficient mass transfer model .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the evolution of massive binaries .",
    "we attempt to use the observed galactic wr+o binaries to constrain the possible formation channels of these binaries , especially the mass transfer efficiency .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the binary evolution code and the adopted assumptions .",
    "we present our calculated results in section 3 , and discuss their implications in section 4 .",
    "we use an updated version of the stellar evolution code originally developed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to calculate the binary evolution .",
    "we employ the twin mode in the code to model the structure and spin of both stars simultaneously @xcite .",
    "we adopt the initial solar chemical compositions ( i.e. , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ) , and the ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale height and the convective overshooting parameter to be 2.0 and 0.12 @xcite , respectively . for the pre - wr stars , we employ the wind mass loss rates of @xcite , except for ob stars for which we adopt the modelled rates of @xcite . for the wr stars [ @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 $ ]",
    ", we use the rates of @xcite .",
    "when all of hydrogen envelope of the primary is stripped away by mass transfer and stellar winds , the code will be artificially broken down .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling due to tidal interactions is treated according to @xcite .",
    "the mass transfer rate via rlof in the code is calculated from the potential difference @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the mass coordinate and the stellar radius , respectively , by integrating the above equation over all the mesh points outside the rl surface potential .",
    "the stability of the mass transfer depends on how much and how fast the secondary can accrete without getting out thermal equilibrium ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "unstable mass transfer would result in the formation of a contact binary @xcite , which may finally evolve to a merger .",
    "since accretion of a small amount of mass can accelerate the star to reach critical rotation @xcite , it is expected that , during most of the mass transfer phase , the accreting star is rapidly rotating , and it is of vital importance to determine the mass accretion efficiency for such a star @xcite . considering the large uncertainty in this point , @xcite constructed three models to model the influence of mass loss on the stability of mass transfer . in model",
    "i , the mass accretion rate onto a rotating star was assumed to be the mass transfer rate multiplying an ad hoc factor @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the angular velocity of the secondary and @xmath23 is its critical value .",
    "the stellar rotation was treated as rigid body , which controlled by spin up due to mass accretion and the spin - orbit coupling through tidal interactions ; in model ii , the mass accretion efficiency was fixed to be @xmath24 ; in model iii , the mass accretion rate was assumed to be limited by a factor of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the mass transfer timescale and @xmath27 is the thermal timescale of the secondary @xcite . as a result of rapid mass accretion ,",
    "the secondary star would get out of thermal equilibrium , expand and become overluminous .",
    "the thermal timescale of the secondary would be significantly decreased , so that the mass transfer was generally quasi - conservative . since previous studies have already disfavored conservative mass transfer in massive binaries , in present study we only consider models i and ii in our calculations .",
    "we assume that the part of the material that is not accreted by the secondary is ejected from the system in the form of isotropic wind , taking away the specific angular momentum of the secondary .",
    "we have calculated a series of binary evolutionary sequences with different values of the initial parameters .",
    "the initial primary mass @xmath28 ( in units of @xmath29 ) , mass ratio @xmath30 and orbital period @xmath31 ( in units of days ) are set as follow , @xmath32 both the binary components are zero - age main - sequence stars at the beginning of binary evolution . if the initial orbital period is so short that the primary has filled its rl , we skip to the next longer orbital period .",
    "there are several ways to produce a wr+o binary .",
    "( 1 ) if the initial orbital period is around a few days , rlof begins when the primary has a burning hydrogen core with case a mass transfer .",
    "after the main - sequence evolution , the primary experiences a rapid contraction due to the depletion of fuel in the convective core , causing the binary to be detached .",
    "when the primary expands due to shell hydrogen burning and fills its rl once more , case ab mass transfer takes place .",
    "after the mass transfer , the primary has lost most of its hydrogen envelope , leaving a helium core burning wr star . at that time",
    "the secondary is a main - sequence o star with an increased mass due to mass accretion .",
    "( 2 ) if the initial orbital period is several weeks , the primary is in the shell hydrogen burning phase when rlof starts .",
    "after this case b mass transfer , the primary becomes a wr star .",
    "( 3 ) if the initial orbital period is of the order of years , there is case c mass transfer when the primary fills its rl during helium shell burning .",
    "the mass transfer proceeds on a dynamical timescale , and common envelope evolution may follow , which will not be investigated in this work .",
    "based on the spectra features , wr stars can be divided into four subtypes : the nitrogen sequence , wnh ( or wnh ) and wn , with strong lines of nitrogen ; the carbon sequence , wc , with strong lines of carbon ; the oxygen sequence , wo , with strong lines of oxygen .",
    "the h or h indicates wn stars with hydrogen . during the wr phase ,",
    "the stellar mass decreases as a consequence of a powerful stellar wind @xcite , and the masses of wc stars are statistically less than the wn masses ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "for the wc and wo stars , there is growing evidence that they are both in the similar evolution phases of post helium burning , but at different surface temperatures and initial mass ranges @xcite . in our calculations , we only focus on the formation of wr+o binaries involving a wn star .      to illustrate the detailed evolutionary sequences , in fig .  1 we show the evolutionary tracks of a binary in model i with the initial parameters of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the orbital periods of 5 ( top panel ) and 40 days ( bottom panel ) , corresponding to the case a and case b mass transfer , respectively .",
    "the left , middle , and right panels show the evolution of the binary in the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram , the mass loss rate and the @xmath35 value of the secondary , and the secondary mass and the orbital period , respectively .",
    "prior to the mass transfer , the primary has lost part of its mass due to the stellar wind , which results in a slight widening of the binary orbit ( in the blue curve ) . in the top panel ,",
    "the mass transfer starts at the age of @xmath36 myr , when the primary is still on the main - sequence .",
    "the mass transfer occurs at a rate of several @xmath37 on the thermal timescale of the primary . about @xmath38 material",
    "is transferred in this rapid case a phase , and both the components roughly have similar mass of @xmath39 .",
    "after that the mass transfer rate declines to several @xmath40 . in this slow case a mass transfer phase , the mass transfer is driven by the nuclear evolution of the primary . when core hydrogen is exhausted , the primary has a mass of @xmath41 .",
    "it attempts to expand because the hydrogen shell ignites , leading to the case ab mass transfer .",
    "the mass transfer rate is @xmath42 .",
    "most of the hydrogen envelope is transferred during this phase , leaving a @xmath43 helium burning star .",
    "after mass transfer , the primary mass decrease to @xmath44 only due to the wr stellar wind ( at a rate of @xmath45 ) .",
    "the orbital period finally grows to about 9 days .",
    "the secondary mass ( in the black curve ) reaches to @xmath46 by accreting @xmath47 material during the whole mass transfer phase .",
    "the @xmath35 always @xmath48 and has a large fluctuation , which can be low to @xmath49 in the slow case a mass transfer phase .",
    "the average mass transfer efficiency @xmath50 is about 0.55 . in the bottom panel ,",
    "the primary fills its rl after the core hydrogen exhaustion at an age of 4.7 myr .",
    "the case b mass transfer occurs rapidly at a rate of @xmath51 , until the @xmath52 hydrogen envelope is stripped .",
    "the primary becomes a @xmath53 helium burning star , and then a @xmath54 wn star due to a stellar wind .",
    "the secondary increases its mass to @xmath55 , and the final orbital period is 81.5 days . during the mass transfer ,",
    "the @xmath35 rapidly increases to be @xmath56 and then roughly keeps this value to the end . in this case the average mass transfer efficiency @xmath57 .",
    "figure  2 shows the same evolutionary sequences for the binary but with model ii adopted . here",
    "half of the transferred mass is assumed to be accreted by the secondary . in the top panel ,",
    "the binary leaves a @xmath58 wn star and a @xmath59 o star with @xmath60 days . in the bottom panel ,",
    "the resulting secondary star is much more massive than that in model i. after the mass transfer , the system possesses a wn+o binary with @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 days .",
    "transfer of mass and angular momentum in massive binaries can greatly influence the properties of the formed wn+o system .",
    "figures  3 and 4 show the calculated mass @xmath64 of the o star and the orbital period as a function of the mass @xmath65 of the wn star in model i. the panels from top to bottom correspond to the results with increasing mass ratio @xmath66 . in each panel ,",
    "the black curves from left to right represent the cases with the primary mass increasing from @xmath67 to @xmath68 with an interval of @xmath69 .",
    "the squares in each of these curves indicate the wn+o binaries that have formed with different @xmath70 .",
    "the blue dashed curves are used to distinguish case a and case b mass transfer .",
    "the two green dashed lines indicate the mass ratios @xmath71 and 1.0 .",
    "the red circles represent the nine observed wn+o binaries with known binary parameters from the wr catalogue @xcite .",
    "their basic parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "5 presents the evolutionary tracks of the primary in the h - r diagram .",
    "the left and right panels correspond to the binary systems with @xmath72 and increasing initial orbital periods , and with @xmath73 days and increasing initial primary masses , respectively .",
    "the black and gray lines donate the primaries with the mass fraction of surface hydrogen @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "the circle symbols denote the observed galactic wn stars with detectable hydrogen , and the triangle symbols refer to the hydrogen - free stars .",
    "the data of the wn stars with @xmath76 is taken @xcite .",
    "we can see that the modelled tracks can generally cross the observed distribution , the calculated wn stars seem to have higher surface temperatures than observed , envelope inflation may be the reason for this discrepancy @xcite . here",
    "we assume that the calculated and observed wn+o binaries are in the similar evolutionary states , the parameter distribution of wn+o binaries can be used to constrain the progenitor evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an example ) .",
    "the formation of wn+o binaries depends on the stability of mass transfer and hence the initial mass ratio .",
    "generally the larger the initial mass ratios @xmath77 , the smaller the parameter spaces for stable mass transfer . systems with @xmath78 may evolve to wn+o binaries only when the initial binary orbital periods are larger than about 4 days @xcite .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show that the wn / o mass ratios increase ( up to @xmath79 ) but the orbital periods decrease with increasing initial mass ratio .",
    "the minimum of the orbital periods is @xmath80 days .    in fig .",
    "6 we present the calculated parameter distributions of wn+o binaries in model ii , which requires the maximum initial mass ratio to be @xmath80 , smaller than in model i. the wn / o mass ratios can reach @xmath81 for systems with @xmath82 .",
    "the calculated orbital periods generally @xmath83 days .    depending on the initial orbital periods",
    ", the binary systems may experience case a or case b mass transfer in the evolution . in the former case , when the initial orbital period is longer",
    ", the primary can develop a heavier core before the mass transfer , resulting in a more massive wn star . in the latter case",
    "the produced wn mass is not sensitive to the initial period , since the primary evolves as a single star during the core hydrogen burning phase without any interaction with the secondary ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "7 , which shows the calculated wn mass as a function of the initial primary masses in models i ( left ) and ii ( right ) .",
    "while the masses of wn stars evolved from case a mass transfer significantly depend on the initial orbital periods , systems with case b mass transfer tend to produce wn stars with similar masses . for latter binaries , we derive a relation between the masses of the initial primary stars and the wn stars as follows @xmath84 in model i , and @xmath85 in model ii .",
    "these results are close to the relation given by @xcite for the systems with quasi - conservative case b mass transfer .",
    "8 shows the average mass transfer efficiencies @xmath50 as a function of the orbital periods of the wn+o binaries in model i. we use different symbols to indicate the binaries with different initial parameters .",
    "the blue dashed curve distinguishes case a and case b mass transfer .",
    "we can find that @xmath50 decreases with increasing orbital period , in the range of @xmath86 for case a mass transfer and @xmath87 for case b mass transfer .",
    "mass accretion tends to spin up the secondary , while the tidal interactions in close binaries attempt to synchronize the spin with the binary orbit .",
    "so systems with shorter orbits have higher mass transfer efficiency , and the mass transfer in the binaries with wider orbits are less efficient .",
    "our calculations demonstrate the possible distribution of the parameters of wn+o binaries . in model",
    "i the binaries contain a wn star of mass @xmath88 and an ob main sequence star of mass @xmath89 with orbital period ranging from about 3 days to several hundred days ( see fig .  3 and 4 ) . in model ii ,",
    "the binaries contain a wn star of mass @xmath90 and an o star of mass @xmath91 with orbital period longer than @xmath92 days ( see fig .",
    "6 ) .    these results can be compared with observed wn+o binaries to constrain the input parameters and mechanisms adopted .",
    "we first note that conservative evolution produces wn+o systems with extremely low mass ratios ( @xmath93 ) and orbital periods much longer than observed @xcite .",
    "non - conservative mass transfer can effectively decrease both the masses of the o stars and the orbital periods via mass and angular momentum loss .",
    "the average mass transfer efficiency in model i varies with a large range",
    ". it can reach @xmath94 for case a mass transfer , because tidal interactions spin down the secondary so it can keep accreting a substantial amount of the mass .",
    "for case b mass transfer , @xmath50 is lower than about 0.2 because the tidal effect is negligible in wide binaries .",
    "so the secondary can keep rapid rotation after being spun up during the initial mass accretion phase , and most of the transferred material is ejected out of the binary . in the @xmath95 plane of figs .  3 and 4 ,",
    "all of the observed wn+o binaries can be well covered with @xmath96 in model  i. in model ii the modeled o stars are considerably more massive than that in model i and observations .",
    "the mass transfer efficiency can be strongly constrained by the parameters of the binary wr 35a .",
    "the estimated masses of the binary component are @xmath97 for the wn star and @xmath98 for the o star , and the orbital period is 41.9 days @xcite . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) or ( 3 ) , we can infer that the initial mass of the primary star should be @xmath99 , so @xmath100 .",
    "the wn / o mass ratio of @xmath101 @xcite disfavors model ii for the formation of such wn+o binaries , implying that the accreted mass by the o star is very small . during case",
    "b mass transfer in model i most of the transferred material can be expelled , leading to binaries with relatively large wn / o mass ratios .",
    "so the progenitor binary is very likely to have experienced highly non - conservative mass transfer .",
    "our results are compatible with previous studies .",
    "@xcite investigated the formation of wr 21 , wr 127 and wr 153ab .",
    "they pointed out that these systems can be produced only if the mass transfer is highly non - conservative , with only @xmath102 of the transferred mass being retained by the mass gainer . in our calculations , these binaries can be formed in model i with inefficient mass transfer if the initial mass ratios @xmath103 and the mass transfer efficiency is @xmath104 . binary evolution in model",
    "ii may produce such binaries only when the @xmath105 .",
    "@xcite suggested that binaries with smaller initial orbital periods evolve more conservatively than wider systems , which is also in agreement with our results of model i ( see fig .",
    "the systems wr 151 and wr 155 have the large wn / o mass ratios of @xmath106 and the short orbital periods of @xmath107 days , these two binaries may be formed through unstable case c mass transfer .",
    "alternatively we only assume that the initial binary systems have circular orbits , the mass transfer in highly eccentric binaries may also contribute to produce these short periods @xcite . in some binaries ,",
    "the o stars have been observed to rotate faster than synchronous rotation @xcite , suggesting that the progenitors have experienced stable mass transfer rather than contact phases or common envelope evolution .",
    "further observations on the spins of the o stars in massive binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can help understand the formation of wn+o binaries .    in summary ,",
