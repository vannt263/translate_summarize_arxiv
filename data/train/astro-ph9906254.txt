    "they were all characterized by a very fast evolution ( @xmath1 days ) and a large amplitude ( from @xmath2 mag in quiescence to @xmath3 mag at maximum ) .",
    "several others have been quite possibly missed because u  sco lies just 4@xmath4 from the ecliptic . in the following the comparison",
    "will be limited to the 1979 and 1987 events , because these are the only ones for which useful spectroscopic and photometric data have been obtained ( s88 , barlow et al . 1981 , williams et al .",

    "the system in quiescence shows eclipses ( schaefer & ringwald 1995 , hereafter sr95 ) with a period of 1.2305631 days .",
    "the bright prospects to derive the masses of the components from spectroscopic orbits have been however hampered by the faintness in quiescence and devoted attempts with 4-m class telescopes have so far provided only contradicting results ( johnston & kulkarni 1992 , duerbeck et al .",
    "1993 , sr95 ) .",
    "thanks to an immediate notification by the outburst discoverer ( p.schmeer , belgium ) and the vsnet network ( cf .",
    "http://www.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/ ) , we were able to begin the monitoring of the 1999 outburst within a few hours from the maximum . in this letter we present the results of our all - out spectroscopic campaign and",

    "modeling of the data and additional observations of u sco once it will have returned to flat quiescence will be presented elsewhere ( selvelli et al .",

    "similarly , a detailed discussion of the reddening as inferred from the interstellar absorption lines visible in our echelle spectra will be addressed in detail elsewhere ( munari and zwitter 1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "a journal of the spectroscopic observations is given in table  1 . in this paper the dates are counted from the outburst maximum brightness @xmath5 mag occurred on jd=2451235.062 ( cf .",

    "high resolution spectra have been obtained with the echelle spectrograph mounted at the cassegrain focus of the 1.82 m telescope which is operated by astronomical observatory of padova on top of mt .",
    "ekar , asiago ( italy ) .",
    "the detector was a thomson thx31156 ccd with 1024@xmath61024 pixels , 19@xmath7 m each , and the slit width was set to @xmath8 .",
    "the multi - order echelle spectra have been successfully processed into single dispersion ones by using spectra of some unreddened a0  v stars close to u  sco and observed under identical conditions ( inter - comparison of the similarly processed a0  v star spectra shows the rectification and joining technique to be accurate to better than @xmath93% ) .",
    "the gaps in the red / near - ir visible in the spectra of figure  2 are caused by non overlapping echelle orders .",
    "medium dispersion spectra were secured with the b&c+ccd spectrograph at the 1.22 m telescope of the astronomy dept .",

    "ccd camera with a 512x512 pixel , 23@xmath7 m size , uv - coated chip .",
    "the slit width was set to @xmath10 .    on march",
    "16th and 17th u sco was observed with the eso ntt and the emmi instrument .",
    "the dispersing element was grism # 5 on the 16th , and grisms # 5 and # 2 the following night .",
    "a @xmath11 slit was used on both nights .",
    "the seeing was @xmath12 the first night and @xmath13 the second .",
    "the da white dwarf hip  80300 was observed as flux standard on march  17 .",
    "visual estimates of u  sco brightness have been obtained by one of us ( ap ) with a private 16 \" f/4 reflector using the a.henden ( usno ) comparison sequence as distributed by vsnet .",
    "the visual estimates are listed in table  2 and the photometric evolution of the 1999 outburst is compared with those of 1979 and 1987 events in figure  1 .",
    "the photometric evolution of the 1999 outburst has followed quite closely that of previous events as figure  1 clearly shows .",
    "small differences may be easily accounted for by ( @xmath14 ) different comparison sequences , and ( @xmath15 ) a mixture of different observing techniques used by b81 and s88 ( visual estimates directly at the eyepiece or on the screen of tv telescope guiding systems , photography , etc . )    with a maximum brightness of @xmath16 on february 25.562 , the 1999 outburst has been characterized by a fast decline with @xmath17 and @xmath18 days , very close to the 0.67 mag day@xmath0 reported by payne - gaposchkin ( 1957 ) for the 1863 and 1936 events .",
    "the outburst was discovered by p.schmeer on february 25.194 when he estimated u  sco at @xmath19 .",
    "this suggests a fast rise to maximum of the order of @xmath20mag = 5.2 day@xmath0 , or even faster if the observation at @xmath16 on february 25.562 was actually past the true maximum .",
    "there is an important negative detection on feb 25.040 listed in table  2 , when u  sco was found fainter than v=14.3 .",
    "this is just 22 minutes before central eclipse according to the sr95 ephemeris and 3.7 hours earlier than the @xmath19 outburst discovery by p.schmeer . adopting the @xmath20mag = 5.2 day@xmath0 rise rate just estimated , u  sco should have been at @xmath21 mag at the time of the feb 25.040 negative detection .",
    "this seems to suggest that the dimensions of the outbursting wd were still smaller than those of the occulting companion 0.522 days before maximum .",
    "however , a different explanation is in order if the sr95 ephemeris should turn out to be no more accurate in 1999 and/or the predicted minima are the eclipse of the hot spot and not those of the wd .    integrating the lightcurve in figure  1 , the energy radiated in the v band by u sco during the time covered by the observations in table  2 can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the extinction in magnitudes and @xmath24 is the distance in kpc .",
    "the slope of the continuum in our spectra suggests a color temperature of about 2@xmath25 @xmath4k .",
    "assuming for sake of discussion that u  sco has radiated on the average as a kurucz s model atmosphere with t=20,000 @xmath4k and log g = 3.0 , we find that the global radiated energy is @xmath26 that radiated in the @xmath27 band , so eq.(1 ) can be rewritten for the bolometric energy as @xmath28 for any reasonable distance inside the galaxy and the extinction generally adopted ( @xmath23=0.6 , cf .",
    "s88 ) , the 1999 outburst of u  sco appears considerably underluminous compared to those of classical novae ( cf .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by w81 from iue observations of the 1979 outburst of u  sco .",
    "in comparison to previous outbursts our observations begun much earlier , significantly extended toward later phases and have been performed at a higher resolution and over a broader wavelength range ( see figure  2 ) .    as for previous outbursts ( cf .",
    "b81 , s88 ) , the spectrum has been characterized by very wide emission lines , with balmer hydrogen lines being the strongest at earliest phases ( in quiescence hydrogen lines are generally absent and mimicked by the pickering series of heii , cf .",
    "hanes 1985 and johnston & kulkarni 1992 ) .",
    "a feature not reported for previous outbursts ( perhaps due to the poorer resolution and looser time coverage ) is the monotonic decrease with time of the fwzi ( full width zero intensity ) of h@xmath29 ( and similarly for the other balmer lines ; cf . figures  2 and 3 ) .",
    "the values in table  1 are plotted in figure  4 where the linear fit is given by the equation : @xmath30 this linear decrease is difficult to explain in term of ejecta deceleration by circumstellar material because the spectra carry no sign of the typical signatures that characterize the presence of shock fronts ( cf .",
    "osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the identification of emission lines other than the balmer ones is complicated by the their large width .",
    "surely present close to maximum are oi 7775 and 8446  , hei 5876 and 7075   ( the presumably weaker 6678 line is nearly lost in the h@xmath29 wings ) and nii 5675 . the complex at 5015   could be a blend of hei and nii , and niii and ciii are probably the main contributors to the blend at @xmath94630  . the ionization degree has increased during the decline , with heii 4686   becoming visible after the first week from maximum . as for previous outbursts , also this time the nebular lines have not shown up in the late spectra of u  sco , reinforcing the notion that a limited amount of material  if any  has been ejected by u  sco .",
    "the balmer and o  i 7775 - 8446   emission lines showed a saddle - like profile at earliest phases , while other lines presented a more gaussian - like profile . at _",
    "day + 3 _ balmer and o  i lines turned to single - peaked profiles as well .",
    "later evolution has been characterized by balmer and heii lines to split into three components with velocity separation of the order of @xmath311600 km sec@xmath0 .",
    "this triple  peak profile was not observed in the 1987 outburst ( cf .",
    "s88 ) and can be perhaps only marginally spotted in the latest h@xmath32 profile presented by b81 for the 1979 outburst .",
    "the eclipsing nature of u  sco prevents an explanation of the triple peaks at later phases ( when the ejecta become presumably optically thin ) as collimated beams of material ejected at a large angle from the plane of the orbit or of an accretion disc .",
    "the 1979 , 1987 and 1999 outbursts spectroscopically resemble each other only in broad terms , with significant differences from eruption to eruption .",
    "such differences might trace large changes from event to event in the optical depth and kinematics of the ejecta .",
    "the optical depth must be connected to the amount of ejected material ( the velocity and time extent remaining about the same from outburst to outburst ) , which should in turn depend on the amount of material accreted between successive outbursts .",
