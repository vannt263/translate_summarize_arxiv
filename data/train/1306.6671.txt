    "the ideas of _ coding theory _ can be described within the setting of _ signal processing _ by using a class of real ( or complex ) bose - chaudhuri - hocquenghem ( bch ) codes @xcite known as the discrete fourier transform codes .",

    "looking from a _ frame theory _ perspective , these codes are used to provide robustness to _ erasure _ in wireless networks @xcite .    when _ error _ correction is required @xcite , _ error localization _ is a crucial step of the decoding algorithm of dft codes .",
    "error localization in bch - dft codes can be done by extending that of binary bch codes to the real field @xcite .",
    "rath and guillemot @xcite used _ subspace - based _",
    "error localization and showed that it outperforms the _ coding - theoretic _ approach ; the improvement is achieved by mitigating the effect of the quantization error by involving as many syndrome samples as possible .",
    "the authors recently employed dft codes for lossy dsc @xcite and adopted subspace error localization in this context @xcite .",
    "this approach to dsc exploits the correlation between the sources in the _ analog _ domain and it is promising in delay - sensitive applications .",
    "the performance of the system , like other dsc systems , degrades when the correlation between the sources is unstable .",
    "although _ puncturing _ can be used for _ rate - adaption _ , it severely affects the error localization and substantially increases the end - to - end distortion .",
    "the primary contribution of this paper is to develop _ rate - adaptive _ distributed source codes based on dft codes . to do so ,",
    "we extend and improve the subspace error localization of dft codes and adapt it both to the parity- and syndrome - based dsc .",
    "the extended subspace error localization is applicable to other codes based on orthogonal transform matrices such as the discrete cosine transform ( dct ) and discrete sine transform ( dst ) codes , as the subspace approach is @xcite .",
    "rate - adaptation for the parity approach is developed only for real dft codes of rate @xmath0 .",
    "however , the syndrome approach is for any real or complex code ; the encoder transmits a short syndrome based on an @xmath1 code and augments it with additional samples if decoding failure is fed back .",
    "the algorithm is incremental so that there is no need to re - encode the sources when more syndrome is requested .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a brief review of dft codes in section  [ sec : dftcodes ] ,",
    "we discuss how the subspace error localization outperforms the coding - theoretic approach and introduce the extended subspace decoding in section  [ sec : loc ] .",
    "we explain the rate - adaptive dsc system in section  [ sec : dsc ] .",

    "the generator matrix of an @xmath1 dft code @xcite , in general , consists of any @xmath2 columns of the inverse dft ( idft ) matrix of order @xmath3 ; the remaining @xmath4 columns of this matrix are used to build the _ parity - check matrix _ @xmath5 .",
    "these codes are a family of _ cyclic codes _ over the complex field .",
    "thus , their codewords satisfy certain spectral properties in the frequency domain @xcite . within the class of dft codes ,",
    "there are bch codes in the complex and real fields .",
    "each codeword of an @xmath1 bch - dft code has @xmath6 cyclically adjacent zeros in the frequency domain .",
    "they are _ maximum distance separable _ codes with _ minimum hamming distance _ @xmath7 .",
    "they are , hence , capable of correcting up to @xmath8 errors .",
    "we consider real bch - dft codes whose generator matrix , for an @xmath1 code , is defined by @xcite @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the dft matrices of size @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and @xmath12 is an @xmath13 matrix with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the generator matrix of a complex bch - dft code can be achieved by removing @xmath11 from ; we can also remove the constraint on @xmath16 .",
    "although we focus on the real bch - dft codes , the results we present in this paper are valid for the complex codes as well . in the rest of this paper , for brevity",
    ", bch - dft codes will be referred to as dft codes .",
    "let @xmath17 be a noisy version of codeword @xmath18 generated by a dft code and suppose that the error vector @xmath19 has @xmath20 nonzero elements .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , denote the locations and magnitudes of the nonzero elements .",
    "the decoding algorithm in dft codes is composed of three main steps  @xcite : _ error detection _ ( to determine @xmath23 ) , _ error localization _",
    "( to find @xmath21 ) , and _ error calculation _",
    "( to calculate @xmath22 ) .",
    "this section is focused on the error localization .",
    "thus , we assume that the number of errors @xmath23 is known at the decoder .    the syndrome of @xmath19 , a key for the decoding algorithm , is computed as @xmath24 where @xmath25^t$ ] is a complex vector with @xmath26 in which @xmath16 is defined in and @xmath27 , @xmath28      the classical approach to the error localization is to identify an _ error locator polynomial _ whose roots correspond to error locations .",

    "and @xmath49 contains the @xmath23 nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath54 . ]",
    "the sizes of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the columns in @xmath52 span the _ channel - error subspace _ spanned by @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "thus , the columns in @xmath53 span the _ noise subspace_. then , from the fact that @xmath58 , we conclude that @xmath59 now , let @xmath60^t$ ] where @xmath61 is a complex variable and define the function @xmath62 @xmath63 can be considered as sum of @xmath64 polynomials @xmath65 of order @xmath66 ; each polynomial corresponds to one column of @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath67 denote this set of polynomials .",
    "in light of , each one of these polynomials vanishes for @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "these are the only common roots of @xmath71 over the @xmath3th roots of unity @xcite ; thus , the errors location can be determined by finding the zeros of @xmath63 over the set of @xmath3th roots of unity .",
    "equivalently , one may use the _ signal subspace _ to find the error location @xcite .",
    "the subspace method outperforms the coding theoretic error localization . to prove this , we can see that @xmath72 is the smallest degree polynomial that has roots in @xmath70 and lies in the noise subspace ; it is achieved for @xmath73 in .",
    "as @xmath39 increases the degree of polynomials @xmath71 goes up which gives more degrees of freedom and helps improve the estimation of roots , and the error locations consequently .",
    "another factor that affects location estimation is the number of polynomials @xmath71 with linearly independent coefficients .",
    "the more there are such polynomials , the better the estimation is as the variations due to noise ( quantization ) are reduced by adding such independent polynomials in @xmath63 .",
    "although the number of polynomials increases with @xmath39 , their coefficients may not be independent .",
    "the latter depends on the number of nonzero eigenvalues in the noise subspace which is , in turn , related to the rank of @xmath74 and is limited by @xmath75 this suggests that the optimum value for @xmath39 is @xmath76 .",
    "then , from , one can check that the subspace approach will result in a better error localization than the coding - theoretic approach , except when @xmath77 and @xmath78 is even ; in this latter case @xmath79 and there is just one polynomial and its degree is @xmath80 , the same as in the coding - theoretic approach .    in practice , where quantization comes into play , the received vector is distorted both by the error vector @xmath19 and quantization noise @xmath81",
    ". therefore @xmath82 , and its syndrome is only a perturbed version of @xmath83 because @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86^t$ ] is the quantization error .",
    "the distorted syndrome samples can be written as @xmath87 where @xmath88 shows the index for quantization error .",
    "the distorted syndrome matrix @xmath89 and its corresponding covariance matrix @xmath90 are defined similar to and but for the distorted syndrome samples .",
    "the main idea behind the extended subspace approach is to enlarge the dimension of the noise subspace such that , in , the number of polynomials with linearly independent coefficients and/or their degree grow .",
    "this can be accomplished by constructing an extended syndrome matrix @xmath91 , in the form of @xmath92 in but for @xmath93 , which is decomposable as @xmath94 for @xmath95 , and @xmath57 and @xmath43 defined in .",
    "following the same argument that led to , it is easy to see that the optimal @xmath39 is @xmath96",
    ". then , as explained in section  [ sec : ss ] , this will improve the error localization .    to form @xmath97",
    ", we first define the extended syndrome @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath99 $ ] show the new number of syndrome samples where there are @xmath100 additional samples as compared to .",
    "similar to the syndrome vector @xmath83 , we define the extended syndrome vector @xmath98 as @xmath101 where @xmath102 consists of those @xmath2 columns of the idft matrix of order @xmath3 used to build @xmath103 . more precisely , for @xmath104",
    ", @xmath105 now , with @xmath106 @xmath91 will be decomposable as provided that the second term in the right - hand side of is vanished , or equivalently @xmath107 is removed from . observe that considering quantization @xmath108 will be replaced by @xmath109 ; i.e. , @xmath110 contains a term related to quantization error , similar to @xmath111 in .",
    "likewise , @xmath112 is built upon @xmath111 and @xmath110 .",
    "again we should emphasize that using @xmath113 ( and @xmath114 ) may not necessarily improve the error localization ; to expect gain by virtue of the extended subspace method , we need to compensate for the term @xmath115 in .",
    "this is done for the syndrome - based dsc in the next section .    before moving on to the next section",
    ", we look at extended subspace method for a special , yet important , class of dft codes where @xmath116 .",
    "for such a code , @xmath117 and @xmath118 is @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) for errors in the even ( odd ) positions in the codeword .",
    "then , if all errors are in the even ( odd ) positions , we can simply replace @xmath98 with @xmath83 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "thus , using we can form @xmath122 and the corresponding @xmath123 . subsequently",
    ", the eigendecomposition of @xmath114 for @xmath124 increases the number of polynomials in @xmath67 and their degree .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the merit of extended error localization to the existing one , for @xmath125 , in a @xmath126 code .",
    "such a big gain in error localization is achieved by using the same @xmath78 syndrome samples but forming a larger syndrome matrix which allows a larger noise subspace .",
    "dft code where all errors are in even positions . ]",
    "similar to the subspace approach @xcite , the extended subspace approach can be applied to the dct and dst codes ; further , it can be used even for the non - bch dct and dst codes @xcite .",
    "knowing that @xmath127 can also be used to determine the number of errors @xmath23 @xcite , where the extended error localization is applicable , @xmath114 can be used for this purpose and it improves the results reasonably .",
    "distributed _ lossless _ compression of two correlated sources can be as efficient as their joint compression @xcite .",
    "this is also valid for _ lossy _ source coding with side information at the decoder for jointly gaussian sources and the mean - squared error ( mse ) distortion measure @xcite .",
    "tipically , dsc is realized by quantizing the sources and applying slepian - wolf coding in the binary domain .",
    "slepian - wolf coding can be implemented in the analog domain as well @xcite which outperforms its binary counterpart for certain scenarios , e.g. , an impulsive correlation model .",
    "the proposed dsc schemes based on dft codes , both parity and syndrome approaches , are also appropriate for low - delay coding as they perform sufficiently well even when short source blocks are encoded .    when the statistical dependency between the sources varies or is not known at the encoder , a _ rate - adaptive _ system with feedback is an appealing solution @xcite .",
    "rate - adaptive dsc based on binary codes , e.g. , puncturing the parity or syndrome bits of turbo and ldpc codes , have been proposed in @xcite . in the sequel ,",
    "we extend dsc based on dft codes @xcite to perform dsc in a rate - adaptive fashion .",
    "we consider two continuous - valued correlated sources @xmath128 and @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are statistically dependent by @xmath132 , and @xmath133 is continuous , i.i.d . , and independent of @xmath130 .",
    "puncturing is a well - known technique used to achieve higher rate codes for the same decoder ; it is inherently well - suited for parity - based dsc schemes as one can remove some of the parity samples to puncture a code .",
    "however , with subspace error localizations , the performance of punctured dft codes deteriorates largely . as explained in the previous section ,",
    "extended subspace decoding significantly improves the results provided that the errors are restricted to even ( odd ) positions .",
    "this can be achieved by using @xmath134 dft codes .",
    "generated by , a @xmath134 dft code is systematic with parity samples in even positions .",
    "we can modify this code and form a code whose parity samples are in the even positions @xcite .",
    "then , the extended syndrome matrix in can be used both for error detection and localization .",
    "similar to the subspace method , the performance of the system drops sharply with puncturing .",
    "furthermore , although simple , puncturing may cause the minimum distance to decrease .",
    "an alternative , general approach for rate - adaptation is presented next .",
    "rate - adaption using puncturing is not natural for syndrome - based dsc systems @xcite . instead",
    ", the encoder can transmit a short syndrome based on an aggressive code and augment it with additional syndrome samples , if decoding fails .",
    "this process loops until the decoder gets sufficient syndrome for successful decoding .",
    "this approach is viable only for feedback channels with reasonably short round - trip time @xcite .    in the syndrome - based dsc based on dft codes @xcite",
    ", the encoder computes @xmath135 and transmits it to the decoder . at the decoder",
    ", we have access to the side information @xmath136 and can compute its syndrome so as to find @xmath137 . for rate adaptation ,",
    "if needed , the encoder transmits @xmath138 sample by sample ; the receiver also can compute @xmath139 and evaluate @xmath140 .",
    "after that , we can form the extended syndrome matrix @xmath91 by replacing @xmath141 and @xmath142 in the right - hand side of .",
    "clearly , when quantization is considered this equation needs to be updated as @xmath143 in which @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 .",
    "the new @xmath147 then is used for error localization as detailed in section  [ sec : loc ] . note that the code is incremental , so the encoder does not need to re - encode the sources when more syndrome is requested .",
    "it buffers and transmits syndrome to the decoder sample by sample .",
    "moreover , we can use @xmath114 to find the number of errors as explained in @xcite .",
    "to evaluate the performance of the algorithm we do simulation using a gauss - markov source with mean zero , variance one , and correlation coefficient 0.9 for two dft codes , namely , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "for each code , we generate the syndrome and extended syndrome , quantize them with a 3-bit uniform quantizer with step size @xmath150 , and transmit them over a noiseless communication media .",
    "we plot the relative frequency of correct localization of different numbers of errors .",
    "to do so , we define channel - error - to - quantization - noise ratio ( ceqnr ) as the ratio of channel error power to the quantization noise power ( @xmath151 ) and , similar to @xcite , we assume that the channel error components are fixed . the number of errors in each block is limited to @xmath152 , the error correction capacity of the code .",
    "the simulation results are for @xmath153 input blocks for each ceqnr .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we compare the frequency of correct localization of errors for the subspace and extended subspace approaches given a @xmath148 code for different errors . the gain due to the extended subspace method is remarkable both for one and two errors ; it is more significant for two errors .",
    "in fact , as discussed in section  [ sec : ss ] , for @xmath77 the subspace approach loses its degrees of freedom ( dof ) and its performance drops to that of the coding - theoretic approach . providing some extra dof , at the expense of a higher code rate ,",
    "the extended subspace approach significantly improves the error localization .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows how error localization boosts up when the additional syndrome samples are involved one by one .",
    "this allows doing dsc using dft codes in a rate - adaptive manner .",
    "the curves for the extended case are based on 3 additional syndrome samples , implying that the code rate is increased from 0.5 to 0.8 . ]",
    "dft code using the subspace method and the extended subspace method with different number of additional syndrome samples .",
    "the the code rate is increased from 0.5 to 0.9 by a step of 0.1 . ]",
    "the gain caused by the extended subspace method increases for codes with higher capacity .",
    "for instance , simulation results for a @xmath149 dft code , presented in fig .  [ fig : fig4 ] , show a significant gain in any ceqnr between @xmath154 to @xmath155db ; this is achieved by sending 4 additional syndrome samples .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that numerical results proves the superiority of using @xmath114 , instead of @xmath127 for finding the number of errors .",
    "finally , since a better error localization implies a lower reconstruction error @xcite , rate - adapted dft codes with extended subspace decoding can be used both to adapt the channel variations and decrease the mse in dsc .",
    "we developed two algorithms for rate - adaptation in the dsc system that uses dft codes for binning .",
    "rate - adaptation is realized by puncturing the parity samples in the parity - based dsc , or augmenting the syndrome samples in the syndrome - based dsc . for decoding",
    ", we introduced an extension of subspace error localization algorithm that substantially improves the error detection and localization , for a slight increase in the code rate .",
    "interestingly , the gain caused by the extended subspace approach increases when capacity of the code or the number of errors go up .",
    "while the algorithm was successfully applied to the syndrome - based dsc in general , we have been able to exploit it only for the codes with rate @xmath0 in the parity - based system .",
    "the extended decoding algorithm can be applied to dct and dst codes , as well ."
