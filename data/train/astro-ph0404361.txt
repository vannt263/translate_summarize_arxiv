    "at present , it is a well established fact that low mass white dwarf ( wd ) stars should be formed during the evolution in close binary systems ( cbss ) .",
    "these objects are expected to have a helium rich interior simply because they have a mass below the threshold for helium ignition of about @xmath2 .",
    "if they were formed as consequence of single star evolution , we would have to wait for timescales far in excess of the present age of the universe to find some of them .",
    "formation of helium wds in cbss was first investigated long ago by kippenhahn , kohl & weigert ( 1967 ) and kippenhahn , thomas & weigert ( 1968 ) .",
    "they found that these objects are formed during the evolution of low mass cbss and that the cooling evolution is suddenly stopped by thermonuclear flashes that are able to swell the star up to produce further roche lobe overflows ( rlofs ) .    since sometime ago",
    ", low mass wds have been discovered as companions to millisecond pulsars ( msp ) .",
    "this fact sparkled interest in helium wds in order to investigate the deep physical links between both members of a given pair .",
    "in particular , it represents an attractive possibility to infer characteristics of the neutron star behaving as a msp by studying the wd in detail .",
    "studies devoted to helium wd properties are those of alberts , et al .",

    "sarna , ergma , & gerkevit - antipova ( 2000 ) considered the problem in the frame of detailed binary evolution calculations .",
    "more recently , podsiadlowski , rappaport , & pfahl ( 2002 ) have also computed the evolution of some cbs configurations that give rise to the formation of helium wds .",
    "also , nelson & rappaport ( 2003 ) have explored in detail the evolutionary scenarios of binary systems with initial periods shorter than the bifurcation one leading to the formation of ultra - compact binaries with periods shorter than an hour . on the opposite , in this paper",
    "we shall deal with a system with an initial period larger than the bifurcation one leading to wider binaries .",
    "remarkably , the first wd found as companion of a msp in globular clusters has been detected by edmonds et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . among recent observations of low mass wd companion to msps we should quote those by van kerkwijk et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who have detect the wd companion of the binary msp psr b1855 + 09 , whose mass is know accurately from measurements of the shapiro delay of the pulsar signal , @xmath3  .",
    "the orbital period of this binary msp is 12.3 days .",
    "more recently , bassa , van kerkwijk & kulkarni ( 2003 ) have found a faint bluish counterpart for the binary msp psr j02018 + 4232 .",
    "the spectra confirm that the companion is a helium wd and , in spite that observations are of insufficient quality to put a strong constrain on the surface gravity , the best fit indicates a low @xmath4 value and hence low mass ( @xmath5  ) . on the other hand , independently , ferraro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and bassa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have identified the optical binary companion to the msp psr j1911 - 5958a , located in the halo of the galactic globular cluster ngc 6752 .",
    "this object turned out to be a blue star whose position in the color - magnitude diagram is consistent with the cooling sequence of a low - mass ( @xmath6  ) , low metalicity helium wd at the cluster distance .",
    "this is the second helium wd with a mass in this range that has been found to orbit a msp in a galactic globular clusters .",
    "also , sigurdsson , et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have detected two companions for the pulsar b 1620 - 26 , one of stellar mass and one of planetary mass .",
    "the color and magnitude of the stellar companion indicate a wd of @xmath7  of age @xmath8  y. for previous detections of this kind of objects we refer the reader to the paper by hansen & phinney ( 1998b ) .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it was soon realized that the key ingredient of wd models is the hydrogen mass fraction in the star .",
    "consequently , this called for a detailed treatment of the outer layers of the star .",
    "iben & macdonald ( 1985 ) demonstrated the relevance of diffusion in the evolution of intermediate mass co wds while iben & tutukov ( 1986 ) found it to be also important in low mass wds .",
    "more recently , althaus , et al .",
    "( 2001abc ) revisited the problem of the formation of helium wds .",
    "in doing so , they mimicked binary evolution by abstracting mass to a 1  object on the rgb .",
    "the main goal of these papers was to investigate in detail the role of diffusion during the evolution as a pre - wd object .",
    "they allowed gravitational settling , chemical and thermal diffusion to operate .",
    "however , they did not considered the possibility of any mass transfer episode after detachment from the rgb .",
    "perhaps the main result of althaus , et al .",
    "( 2001abc ) was the finding that for models with diffusion there exists a threshold mass value @xmath9 above which the object undergoes several thermonuclear flashes in which a large fraction of the hydrogen present in the star is burnt out .",
    "consequently , as the star enters on the final cooling track it evolves fast , reaching very low luminosities on a timescale comparable with the age of the universe .",
    "quite contrarily , in models without diffusion , evolutionary timescales are much longer , making it difficult to reconcile with observations .",
    "for wds belonging to cbss in companion with msp , wd ages should be comparable to the characteristic age of pulsars @xmath10 ( for a pulsar of period @xmath11 with period derivative @xmath12 that had an initial period @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and braking index @xmath15 ) .",
    "this should be so , because it is generally accepted that the msp is recycled by accretion from its normal companion .",
    "however , it was found that the wd was much dimmer than predicted by models without diffusion , which should be interpreted as consequence of a faster evolution .",
    "this has been the case of the companion of psr b1855 + 09 .    for objects with masses below @xmath9",
    "no thermonuclear flash occurs and the star does not suffer from another rlof .",
    "consequently , it retains a thick hydrogen layer , able to support nuclear burning , forcing the wd to remain bright for a very long time .",
    "this is the case of the companion of psr j1012 + 5307 .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to revisit the problem of the formation and evolution of helium wds in cbss by performing full binary computations considering diffusion starting with models on the main sequence all the way down to stages of evolution of the remnant as a very cool wd . to our notice",
    "this is the first time such a study is carried out . in this way",
    "we largely generalize the previous studies from our group on this topic . in doing so",
    ", we have preferred to concentrate on a particular binary system , deferring a detailed exploration of the huge parameter space ( masses , orbital periods , chemical compositions , etc . ) to future publications . to be specific ,",
    "we have chosen to study a cbs composed by a 2  normal star together with a neutron star with a `` canonical '' mass of 1.4  on an initial orbit of 1 day of period .",
    "we assumed solar chemical composition with @xmath16 for which @xmath17  ( althaus et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "in order to explore the role and interplay of mass loss episodes and diffusion we have constructed four complete evolutionary calculation :    * case a : diffusion , all rlof operate ( including flash - induced rlof ) * case b : diffusion , without flash - induced rlof * case c : no diffusion , all rlof operate * case d : no diffusion , without flash - induced rlof    regarding mass transfer episodes we have chosen to study the case of fully non conservative conditions , i.e. , those in which all the matter transferred from the primary star is lost from the system carrying away all its intrinsic angular momentum .",
    "we do so in order get the strongest possible rlofs which , in turn , will produce the largest mass transfer episodes .",
    "in this sense , we shall get an upper limit to the effects of rlofs on the whole evolution of the star , in particular regarding the ages of very cool wds .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : numerical ] we describe our code paying special attention to the changes we implemented in the scheme for computing mass transfer episodes .",
    "then , in section [ sec : calcula ] we describe the evolutionary results for the four cases considered here . finally , in [ sec : discu ] we discuss the implicances of our calculations and summarize the main conclusions of this work .",
    "in the computations presented below we have employed the code for computing stellar evolution in close binary systems presented in benvenuto & de vito ( 2003 ) .",
    "now we have incorporated the full physical ingredients with the aim of getting state - of - the - art evolutionary results . in particular , we have included a complete set of nuclear reactions to describe hydrogen and helium burning together with diffusion processes . for more details on the considered physics ,",
    "see , e.g. , althaus , et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .    regarding the outer boundary condition , we have incorporated the formula given by ritter ( 1988 ) for computing the mass transfer rate @xmath18 :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the mtr for a star that exactly fills the roche lobe",
    "( see ritter s paper for its definition ) , @xmath21 is the equivalent radius of the roche lobe ( see below ) , @xmath22 is the stellar radius and @xmath23 is the photospheric pressure scale height .",
    "we have considered that a mass transfer episode is underway when @xmath24 with @xmath25 . in this way",
    "the star begins ( ends ) to transfer mass in a very natural and smooth way .",
    "this has been completely adequate for the purpose of carrying out the calculations presented below .",
    "in order to present the numerical calculations we shall describe in detail the sequence for which all physical ingredients were considered ( case a ) in which we allowed diffusion and mass transfer in each rlof to operate . the evolutionary track in the hr diagram corresponding to case a",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrs ] . the 2  object begins to evolve and the the first rlof occurs ( point 1 in table  [ table : casoa ] ) when it is still burning hydrogen in the center .",
    "thus , we are dealing with class a mass transfer , as defined by kippenhahn & weigert ( 1967 ) . at that moment",
    "the hydrogen central abundance is @xmath26 .",
    "from there on , as consequence of the orbital evolution of the binary , the primary star undergoes a huge mass loss ( see the first panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mlossa ] ) which continues up to the moment ( point 2 in table  [ table : casoa ] ) at which central hydrogen exhaustion occurs .",
    "the star contracts and mass transfer is stopped ; at that moment the mass of the primary is of 1.59252 .",
    "little latter , as consequence of the formation of a shell hydrogen burning zone , the star inflates and mass transfer starts again ( point 3 ) , and stands on a long period at which the star losses almost @xmath27 % of the initial mass , ending with a mass of 0.22007  .",
    "hereafter we shall consider these _ two _ rlof episodes as an _ initial _ rlof in order to differentiate it from the other flash  -  induced rlofs . during the initial mass transfer episode ,",
    "the hydrogen content of the outermost layers dropped up to a minimum value of @xmath28 because mass transfer dredges up layers that were previously undergoing appreciable nuclear burning ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : abunda ] ) .",
    "this increase in the mean molecular weight of the plasma present in the outer layers of the star favours the contraction of the primary star . at point 4",
    "the star detaches from the roche lobe , and since then on the star evolves bluewards very fast up to approximately the moment at which reaches a local maximum in the effective temperature . after such maximum effective temperature ,",
    "evolution appreciably slows down allowing diffusion to have time enough to sensibly evolve the hydrogen profile . here , hydrogen tends to float simply because it is the lighter element present in the plasma .",
    "this is clearly shown as a steep increase in fig .",
    "[ fig : abunda ] where we show the surface hydrogen abundance .",
    "] of the model as a function of time .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the sequence of models corresponding to case b ( case c ) is very similar to that corresponding to case a ( case d ) and will not be discussed in detail .",
    "the obvious major difference is related to the size the star is able to reach just after thermonuclear flashes . as in case b ( case d )",
    "it is assumed that there is no limitation imposed by the size of the roche lobe , after thermonuclear flashes , the star reaches effective temperatures far lower than those allowed in the case of the occurrence of rlofs . quite noticeably , the evolutionary timescale of the final wd cooling track is largely independent of the occurrence of any thermonuclearly flash - induced rlof ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lumi ] ) .",
    "another interesting difference arises regarding the characteristic timescale of evolution of the models from the red part of the diagram to the maximum effective temperature conditions . we have found that in such stages , evolution of models for which thermonuclearly induced rlofs are allowed",
    "suffer from a much faster evolution regardless of the allowance or not of diffusion . to be specific , from minimum to maximum effective temperature , case b models take @xmath29  y while models with rlof spend only @xmath30  y from roche lobe detachment to maximum effective temperature .",
    "this , obviously indicates that it should be more difficult to find objects at such conditions than predicted in models without thermonuclearly - induced rlofs . also , notice in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrs ] that the subflashes ( little loops in the evolutionary tracks occurring when the star is evolving bluewards ) happen at different effective temperatures depending on the allowance of rlofs .",
    "in fact , in models with ( without ) rlofs subflashes occur at higher ( lower ) effective temperatures for consecutive thermonuclear flashes .",
    "this is so irrespective of allowance or not of diffusion .",
    "in this work we have computed the evolution of a binary system composed by a neutron star with a `` canonical mass '' of 1.4  and a normal , population i main sequence star of 2  in orbit with a 1 day period .",
    "we have performed the calculations employing an updated version of the code presented in benvenuto & de vito ( 2003 ) in which we have included the main standard physical ingredients together with diffusion processes .",
    "also a proper outer boundary condition was incorporated following ritter ( 1988 ) ( see  [ sec : numerical ] ) .    in order to explore the role of mass transfer episodes from the primary star and its interplay with diffusion we have considered four situations : diffusion ,",
    "all rlof operate ( case a ) ; diffusion , no flash  -  induced rlof operates ( case b ) ; no diffusion , all rlof operate ( case c ) ; and no diffusion , no flash  -  induced rlof operates ( case d ) .",
    "see introduction (   [ sec : intro ] ) of further details .    to our notice , these calculations represent the first detailed study of binary evolution considering diffusion . in this sense , this work represents a natural generalization of the results presented by althaus , serenelli & benvenuto ( 2001a ) in which binary evolution processes was mimicked by forcing a 1  star on the red giant branch to undergo an appropriate mass loss rate .",
    "now the proper inclusion of the specific processes that govern binary evolution offer us a more physically sound description of the formation of low mass , helium white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "in particular , now we have the possibility of connecting stellar structure and evolution with the orbital parameters of the systems allowing for a deeper comparison with observations .    from the results presented in the previous sections ,",
    "it is clear that diffusion is far more important in determining the timescale of evolution of the stars than mass transfer episodes during flash  -  induced rlofs .",
    "this is so especially when the object reaches the final cooling track .",
    "we found that timescales are almost insensitive to the occurrence of flash  -  induced rlof episodes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lumi ] ) .",
    "this constitutes the main result of the present work .",
