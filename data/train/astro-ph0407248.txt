    "interactions and mergers drive galactic evolution and cause starbursts . in the past decade , the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has unveiled evidence for the formation of massive star clusters or young globular clusters in merging galaxies , such as ngc 7252 @xcite , the antennae galaxy @xcite , ngc 3597 @xcite , and ngc 3921 @xcite , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "there have been several theoretical models for the formation of globular clusters ( gcs ) , including primary models where clusters form before galaxies ( e.g @xcite ) , secondary models where clusters form with galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , tertiary models where clusters form after galaxies , such as in mergers ( @xcite ) , and unified models @xcite .",
    "models have been reviewed by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the hst observations have prompted particular interest in the merger scenario .",
    "there have been many numerical simulations of galaxy mergers ( @xcite ) , but only a few focus on gc formation in mergers .",
    "these include semi - analytical models @xcite , combined n - body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations @xcite , and adaptive - grid cosmological simulations @xcite . in these models",
    "individual gcs are not identified and directly followed .",
    "in addition , the star formation history of the merger is not compared to that of the isolated progenitors .",
    "we here model gc formation in both isolated disk galaxies and their mergers using n - body / sph simulations .",
    "absorbing sink particles are used to directly represent individual massive young star clusters . in ",
    "2 we briefly describe our computational method .",
    "we discuss the burst of gc formation during the merging event in   3 , and compare with the evolution of the isolated galaxy .",
    "we then focus on the cluster mass and age distribution at the end of the merger in   4 , and summarize in   5 .",
    "we use the publicly available sph code gadget @xcite , and implement absorbing sink particles that do not interact hydrodynamically @xcite to directly measure the mass of gravitationally collapsing gas . to represent gcs , we allow sinks to form when the local density exceeds 1000 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "our galaxy model consists of a dark matter halo , and a disk of stars and isothermal gas .",
    "we follow the analytical work by @xcite and the numerical implementation by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our simulations meet three numerical criteria , the jeans resolution criterion ( @xcite ) , the gravity - hydro balance criterion for gravitational softening @xcite , and the equipartition criterion for particle masses @xcite .",
    "we adopt a halo concentration parameter @xmath3 , a spin parameter @xmath4 , and hubble constant @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the galaxy model studied here initially has rotational velocity @xmath7 = 100 km s@xmath6 at the virial radius where the overdensity is 200 , and a virial mass of @xmath8 .",
    "total mass in the disk and in the disk gas as fraction of the virial mass are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "an isothermal equation of state with sound speed @xmath11 km s@xmath6 is used .",
    "the total particle number for each single galaxy is @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for disk gas and stars , and halo dark matter , respectively .",
    "the corresponding gravitational softening lengths are @xmath16  kpc , @xmath17  kpc , and @xmath18 kpc .",
    "the spatial resolution of the gas is thus 10 pc , and the mass per gas particle is @xmath19 .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude better resolution than the models of @xcite .",
    "we perform two simulations .",
    "one follows the evolution of the isolated galaxy described above , and the other is an equal - mass , head - on merger of two such galaxies .",
    "the two galaxies are on a parabolic orbit and are separated initially by a distance of 300 kpc . in the merger run , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 gas particles and corresponding other particle numbers .",
    "the simulations are followed for up to 5 gyr .",
    "our single galaxies begin marginally stable to gravitational instability @xcite , with initial toomre instability parameter for gas @xmath22 .",
    "stars form slowly but steadily , mostly in the center . in the merger event ,",
    "the galaxies first collide at @xmath23 gyr , then separate to @xmath24  kpc at @xmath25 gyr , fall back , and finally merge at @xmath26 gyr .",

    "the colored dots represent ( _ yellow _ ) older gcs with lifetimes @xmath28  myr , ( _ green _ ) young gcs with @xmath29  myr and @xmath30 , ( _ red _ ) young gcs with @xmath31 , and ( _ black _ ) the most massive young gc.,height=307 ]    most clusters form during the first close encounter at @xmath321.41.7  gyr . to estimate their stellar masses , we make the assumption that individual sink particles represent regions of dense molecular gas .",
    "observations by @xcite and @xcite suggest that the _ local _ star formation efficiency in molecular clouds remains roughly constant .",
    "we assume that 35% of the mass of each sink particle forms stars , and will show in future work that a range of 2050% is consistent with the observed schmidt law .",
    "using this assumption , the cluster mass range is @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore identify these clusters as newly formed gcs .",
    "figure [ fig_tail ] shows that during the first encounter gcs form in the extended tidal features where the gas reaches high density , in agreement with observations ( @xcite ) .",

    "our final derived value of @xmath45 depends linearly on this .",
    "each single galaxy has a stellar mass of @xmath47 , so we can derive @xmath48  mag , so @xmath49 . similarly , the elliptical merger remnant has @xmath50 , which gives @xmath51  mag , and @xmath52 .",
    "these values are consistent with observations .",
    "for example , the milky way - like spiral m31 has @xmath53 @xcite , while typical ellipticals have @xmath54 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these estimates do depend on the stellar mass - to - light ratio of the galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) and survival rate of the clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , they reflect the difference between isolated disk galaxies and mergers , and suggest that mergers can explain the considerably higher specific frequency of gcs observed in elliptical galaxies .",

    "massive gcs are concentrated towards the center of the elliptical galaxy that remains after the merger , while less massive ones are found at greater radii as well .",
    "old gcs formed prior to the first encounter and the youngest gcs formed in the second encounter are concentrated towards the center of the galaxy , while gcs formed in the first encounter are also found at large radii .",
    "the oldest gcs in our simulation are also the most massive , and quickly sink towards the center by dynamical friction .",
    "the youngest ones occur in the galactic center because remaining gas assembles there during the final merger . during the first encounter ,",
    "on the other hand , gcs form in the tidal tails with greater angular momentum , and so have a broad radial distribution .",
    "if we assume a metallicity - age relation such that older gcs have lower metallicities @xcite , we clearly see a bimodal metallicity distribution .",
    "young , high - metallicity gcs are centrally concentrated , while older , lower - metallicity gcs extend to larger radii , in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "the isolated galaxy forms clusters slowly and steadily , so age , as well as metallicity , follow a smooth distribution .",
    "there is no bimodality .",
    "our results thus support the arguments of @xcite and @xcite that mergers are required to produce a bimodal distribution .",
    "we present high - resolution simulations of star cluster formation in both a single galaxy and a major merger , using a three - dimensional sph code that includes absorbing sink particles to represent massive star clusters .",
    "this allows direct identification of individual clusters and tracking of their orbital evolution over several gigayears .",
    "the merging galaxies show bursts of massive star cluster formation , in sharp contrast to the steady but slow formation in an isolated galaxy .",
    "most new clusters form in the tidal tails and bridges between the merging galaxies .",
    "they are identified as progenitors of globular clusters , although it should be emphasized that we do not include dynamical destruction of clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) in the simulations .",
    "dynamical destruction will change the number and mass of gcs , affecting our derived specific frequency ( where we accounted for it very crudely ) and spatial distribution .",
    "inclusion of a destruction model to determine the evolution of our cluster particles will be necessary to fully address these questions .",
    "the estimated specific globular cluster frequency @xmath45 in the elliptical galaxy resulting from the merger exceeds by a factor of 3 that in an isolated galaxy with the same parameters as the merging galaxies , most of the enhancement being in metal - rich gcs .",
    "this supports the idea that the higher @xmath45 of metal - rich gcs observed in ellipticals is produced by mergers .",
    "however , elliptical galaxies also show higher @xmath45 for metal - poor gcs .",
    "early mergers could explain this , though other mechanisms have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "clusters formed during different phases of the merger have distinct radial distributions .",
    "the spatial distribution of metal - poor old clusters formed before the first encounter as well as of metal - rich younger clusters from the final encounter is centrally concentrated , while clusters formed in the first encounter are more widely dispersed .",
    "this suggests the observed multimodal metallicity distribution of globular clusters in elliptical galaxies is the direct result of merger processes .",
