    "recent work on parton distributions functions ( pdf s ) in the nucleon has focussed on probing the sea and gluon distribution at small @xmath4 .",
    "the valence quark distributions has been thought to be relatively well understood .",
    "however , the precise knowledge of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 quark distribution at high @xmath4 is very important at collider energies in searches for signals for new physics at high @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath5 as @xmath13 is of theoretical interest .",
    "recently , a proposed cteq toy model  @xcite included the possibility of an additional contribution to the @xmath1 quark distribution ( beyond @xmath14 ) as an explanation for both the initial hera high @xmath12 anomaly  @xcite , and for the jet excess at high-@xmath15 at cdf  @xcite . in this communication",
    "we conclude that a re - analysis of data from nmc and slac leads to a great improvement in our knowledge of the pdf s at large @xmath4 .",
    "information about valence quarks originates from proton and neutron structure function data .",
    "the @xmath1 valence quark distribution at high @xmath4 is relatively well constrained by the proton structure function @xmath16 . however , the neutron structure function @xmath17 , which is sensitive to the @xmath0 valence quark at high @xmath4 , is actually extracted from deuteron data .",
    "therefore , there is an uncertainty in the @xmath0 valence quark distribution from the corrections for nuclear binding effects in the deuteron . in past extractions of @xmath17 from deuteron data ,",
    "only fermi motion corrections were considered , and other binding effects were assumed to be negligible .",
    "recently , the corrections for nuclear binding effects in the deuteron , @xmath18 , have been extracted empirically from fits to the nuclear dependence of electron scattering data from slac experiments e139/140  @xcite .",
    "the empirical extraction uses a model proposed by frankfurt and strikman  @xcite , in which all binding effects in the deuteron and heavy nuclear targets are assumed to scale with the nuclear density .",
    "the correction extracted in this empirical way is also in agreement ( for @xmath19 ) with recent purely theoretical calculations  @xcite of nuclear binding effects in the deuteron .",
    "the total correction for nuclear binding in the deuteron is about 4% at @xmath20 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2dp](a ) ) , and in a direction which is opposite to what is expected from the previous models which only included the fermi motion effects .",
    "the ratio @xmath2 is directly related to @xmath5 . in leading order qcd , @xmath21 at high @xmath4 .",
    "we perform a nlo analysis on the precise nmc @xmath2 data  @xcite to extract @xmath5 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "we extract the ratio @xmath22 by applying the nuclear binding correction @xmath18 to the @xmath2 data . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2dp](b ) , the standard pdf s do not describe the extracted @xmath22 .",
    "since the @xmath1 distribution is relatively well constrained , we find a correction term to @xmath5 in the standard pdf s ( as a function of @xmath4 ) by only varying the @xmath0 distribution to fit the data .",
    "the correction term is parametrized as a simple quadratic form , @xmath23 for the mrs(r2 ) pdf , where the corrected @xmath5 ratio is @xmath24 . based on this correction",
    ", we obtain a mrs(r2)-modified pdf as shown in fig [ fig : dou](a ) .",
    "the corrections to other pdf s such as cteq3 m is similar .",
    "the nmc data , when corrected for nuclear binding effects in the deuteron , clearly indicate that @xmath5 in the standard pdf s  @xcite is significantly underestimated at high @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dou ] .",
    "fig.[fig : dou](a ) also shows that the modified @xmath5 ratio approaches @xmath25 as @xmath26 , in agreement with a qcd prediction  @xcite . in contract , if the deuteron data is only corrected for fermi motion effects ( as was mistakenly done in the past ) both the @xmath5 from data and the @xmath5 in the standard pdf s fits approach @xmath27 as @xmath13 .",
    "information ( which is not affected by the corrections for nuclear effects in the deuteron ) on @xmath5 can be extracted from @xmath7 production data in hadron colliders .",
    "fig.[fig : dou](b ) shows that the predicted @xmath7 asymmetry calculated with the dyrad nlo qcd program using our modified pdf is in much better agreement with recent cdf data  @xcite at large rapidity than standard pdf s .",
    "when the modified pdf at @xmath12=@xmath28 is evolved to @xmath12=@xmath29 using the dglap nlo equations , we find that the modified @xmath0 distribution at @xmath30 is increased by about 40 % in comparison to the standard @xmath0 distribution .",
    "the modified pdf s have a significant impact on the prediction of the cross sections in the hera high @xmath12 region because the charged current scattering with positrons is on @xmath0 quarks only .",
    "it also impacts neutral current scattering because of the large coupling of the @xmath31 to @xmath0 quarks at high @xmath12 .",
    "the modified pdf s also lead to an increase of 10% in the qcd prediction for the production rate of very high @xmath32 jets in hadron colliders .",
    "since all the standard pdf s , including our modified version , are fit to data with @xmath4 less than 0.75 , we now investigate the validity of the modified mrs(r2 ) at very high @xmath4 by comparing to @xmath16 data at slac .",
    "although the slac data at very high @xmath4 are at reasonable values of @xmath12 @xmath33 , there are in a region in which non - perturbative effects such as target mass and higher twist are very large .",
    "we use the georgi - politzer calculation  @xcite for the target mass corrections ( tm ) .",
    "these involve using the scaling variable @xmath34 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "since a complete calculation of higher twist effects is not available , the very low @xmath12 data is used to obtain information on the size of these terms .",
    "we use two approaches in our investigation of the higher twist contributions : an empirical method , and the renormalon model . in the empirical approach ,",
    "the higher twist contribution is evaluated by adding a term @xmath35 to the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) prediction of the structure function ( including target mass effects ) .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of the higher twist coefficients @xmath36 is fitted to the global dis @xmath3 ( slac , bcdms , and nmc ) data  @xcite in the kinematic region ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) with the following form , @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is a floating factor to investigate possible @xmath4 dependent corrections to our modified pdf .",
    "a functional form , @xmath41 for @xmath36 is used in the higher twist fit to estimate the size of the higher twist terms above @xmath42 .",
    "the slac and bcdms data are normalized to the nmc data . in the case of the bcdms data ,",
    "a systematic error shift @xmath43 ( in standard deviation units ) is allowed to account for the correlated point - to - point systematic errors .",
    "the empirical higher twist fits with the modified nlo mrs(r2 ) pqcd prediction with tm have been performed simultaneously on the proton and deuteron @xmath3 data with 11 free parameters ( 2 relative normalizations and 3 parameters for @xmath44 per target and the bcdms @xmath43 ) .",
    "the results of the fit are given in table  [ ht - fit ] .",
    ".results of the higher twists fits ( with pqcd+tm ) to the dis f2 data [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we find that empirical higher twist fit describes the data well ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the size of the higher twist contributions in the proton and deuteron are similar .",
    "the magnitude is almost half of those extracted in previous analysis of slac / bcdms data  @xcite .",
    "this is because that analysis was based on ( ) @xmath46 , while the mrs(r2 ) pdf uses ( ) @xmath47 , which is close to the current world average .    in the renormalon model approach  @xcite ,",
    "the model predicts the complete @xmath4 dependence of the higher twist contributions to @xmath3 , @xmath48 , and @xmath11 , with only two unknown parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we extract the @xmath49 and @xmath50 parameters , which determine the overall level of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 terms by fitting to the global data set for @xmath3 and @xmath53 .",
    "the values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the proton and deuteron are same in this model .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath48 differs from that of @xmath3 but is same as that of @xmath11 within a power correction of @xmath51 .",
    "our fits can also be used to estimate the size of the higher twist effects in @xmath11 ( e.g. the gls sum rule ) .",
    "the higher twist fit in this approach has employed the same procedure as the empirical method .",
    "[ fig : disht ] shows that the model yields description of @xmath4 dependence of higher twist terms in both @xmath3 and @xmath9 with just the two free parameters ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the ccfr neutrino data  @xcite is shown for comparison though it is not used in the fit .",
    "the extracted values of @xmath49 are @xmath55 and @xmath56 , for proton and deuteron , respectively .",
    "the contribution of @xmath50 is found to be negligible .",
    "we find that the floating factor @xmath40 for the deuteron deviates from 1 and is also bigger than that for the proton , unless the modified mrs(r2 ) pdf is used .",
    "this reflects our earlier conclusion that the standard @xmath0 distribution is underestimated at high @xmath4 region .",
    "as expected , the extracted @xmath49 value is half of the previous estimated value  @xcite of @xmath49 based on slac / bcdms ( ( ) @xmath46 ) analysis .",
    "since both of these approaches yield a reasonable description for the higher twist effects , we proceed to compare the predictions of the modified pdf s ( including target mass and renormalon higher twist corrections ) to the slac proton @xmath3 data at very high @xmath4 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "there is a wealth of slac data  @xcite in the region up to @xmath58 and intermediate @xmath12 @xmath33 .",
    "previous pdf fits have not used these data .",
    "we use the estimate of the higher twist effects from the models , based on the data ( below @xmath19 ) described above . note that the data for @xmath14 is in the dis region , and the data for @xmath59 is the resonance region .",
    "it is worthwhile to investigate the resonance region also because from duality arguments  @xcite it is expected that the average behaviour of the resonances and elastic peak should follows the dis scaling limit curve .",

    "higher twist effects , the very high @xmath4 data from slac is remarkably well described by the modified mrs(r2 ) up to @xmath58 . the good description of the data by the modified mrs(r2 ) is also achieved using the empirical estimate ( @xmath35 ) of higher twist effects as shown ( dashed line ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : highx](c ) .",
    "the data at @xmath59 and @xmath60 is somewhat lower than the predictions of the modified mrs(r2 ) but relatively the large @xmath12 data ( @xmath61 ) show a good agreement as shown in fig .",

    "we find that the slac @xmath3 data do not support the cteq toy model which proposed an additional @xmath1 quark contribution at high @xmath4 as an explanation of the initial hera high @xmath12 anomaly and the cdf high-@xmath15 jet excess .    0.3 cm",
