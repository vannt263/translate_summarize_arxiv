    "during the first quarter of the twentieth century , cataloging the stellar constituents of the solar neighborhood became a major focus of astronomical research .",
    "although the closest of the bright stars were identifiable through dedicated trigonometric parallax programs , such programs were nt feasible for the wealth of dimmer objects .",
    "as a result the search for the faintest of the nearby stars came to rely heavily on the fact that tangential motion of the closest objects would be measurable against the sea of non - moving background objects . as a result , these proper motion measurements using multi - epoch photographic plates became the primary means of discovery .",
    "the closest star to the sun , proxima centauri , was discovered as a distant , common proper motion companion of @xmath2 centauri ab by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered the second closest system  most commonly known as barnard s star  via its proper motion , which is still the highest known for any star ( 10@xmath337/yr , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite used proper motion to uncover the third closest system , known as wolf 359 , and @xcite did the same to reveal the seventh , eighth , and eleventh nearest systems , known as ross 154 , ross 248 , and ross 128 , respectively . taking this work to even fainter limits , @xcite performed a photographic search for companions to nearby stars and revealed two late - m dwarfs , known as van biesbroeck 8 ( vb 8) and van biesbroeck 10 ( vb 10 ) , that for many years marked the bottom of the known main sequence .",
    "deeper , larger scale proper motion surveys by @xcite and by @xcite were performed in the mid - twentieth century .",
    "these luyten references tabulate the results of all previous motion surveys done through the 1970 s .",
    "these surveys accounted for a total of over 58,000 motion stars with @xmath4/yr down to the @xmath5-band plate limit of the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) and to brighter limits for stars south of the poss itself .",
    "a major limitation of these previous surveys was their reliance on optical data , primarily at @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands ; a lack of deep , dual - epoch material in the far southern sky ; and an inability to probe close to the galactic plane .",
    "recent large - area surveys have attempted to remove some of these biases while still using photographic plate material .",
    "luyten s surveys , which generally required that objects be detectable on both the @xmath5- and @xmath6-band plates and be located at relatively high galactic latitude , have now been supplemented with the lspm / lsr proper motion survey of @xcite and @xcite , which uses two - epoch @xmath6-band data only ( when two epochs are available ) to push to intrinisically redder and fainter objects .",
    "similiar investigations , many concentrating more heavily on the less - complete southern sky , have been performed by the wroblewski & torres survey ( wt ; @xcite and references therein ) , the calan european southern observatory survey ( calan - eso ; @xcite ) , the automated plate measuring proper motion survey ( apmpm ; @xcite ) , the supercosmos sky survey proper motion survey ( ssspm ; @xcite ) , the liverpool - edinburgh high proper motion survey ( lehpm ; @xcite ) , and the supercosmos - recons survey ( scr ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "ccd - based surveys have also begun to have an impact .",
    "the skymorph database from the near earth asteroid tracking program uncovered a previously unrecognized late - m dwarf moving at 5@xmath305/yr that now ranks as one of the closest stars to the sun ( @xcite ) .",
    "this discovery highlights the fact that deeper visible - light surveys with shorter epoch differences will be able to detect nearby stars with motions too large to have been detected with prior searches .",
    "surveys by the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; @xcite ) in the northern hemisphere and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) and skymapper telescope ( southern sky survey , aka s3 ; @xcite ) in the southern hemisphere will provide an ultra - deep ccd - based proper motion catalog for the entire sky .    limiting the search to optical surveys will , of course , render the census very incomplete for the faintest , coolest targets that have their peak flux at longer wavelengths . as photometric searches of the two micron all - sky survey",
    "( 2mass ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ) have shown , the solar neighborhood is replete with , and perhaps even dominated by , dwarfs cooler than type m. most of these objects have been uncovered using color selections appropriate for cool dwarfs with solar age and solar metallicity , but this method will miss cool halo objects with very low metallicity and any other objects of unusual color . therefore ,",
    "proper motion surveys at these longer wavelengths are needed to search for classes of very cool , nearby objects that may have heretofore gone unnoticed .    with this point in mind , researchers have begun to perform proper motion surveys beyond 1 @xmath7 m .",
    "the southern infrared proper motion survey ( sips ; @xcite ) compares @xmath8-band supercosmos data to 2mass @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 data , although in this case objects are chosen using 2mass colors before being paired up with supercosmos @xmath8-band data , hence leading to some of the same biases and incompletenesses noted above . @xcite",
    "have performed a proper motion search free of these photometric - selection biases by performing a cross - matching of 2mass ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) with sdss data releases 1 through 5 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath0 ) .",
    "this work uncovered thirty - six objects with @xmath16 that were not catalogued previously .",
    "six of these have been followed up spectroscopically and the results include one mid - t dwarf , a late - m subdwarf , and an unusually blue l dwarf .",
    "even more recently , @xcite have matched up data from the united kingdom infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite ) data release 4 with 2mass to identify 267 low - mass stars and brown dwarfs via their proper motions ; of these , ten known l dwarfs and one known t dwarf were recovered and nine new l dwarf candidates identified .",
    "we present here a large - area ( @xmath174030 sq .",
    ". , or @xmath1710% of the sky ) proper motion survey where both epochs of coverage lie longward of 1 @xmath7 m . by performing a color - free proper motion search",
    "we can achieve several goals : 1 ) we can determine the location of unusual objects in color space to enable future photometric searches for these objects .",
    "2 ) the kinematic bias present in a proper motion survey will enable us to find very old brown dwarfs , and such newfound discoveries will help to expand the list of observed low - metallicity , low - temperature atmospheres and provide invaluable tests of atmospheric theory .",
    "3 ) we can begin to explore the mass function of substellar halo objects , allowing us for the first time to probe the efficiency of brown dwarf formation in low - metallicity environments .",
    "for the first part of our survey we used data from the 2mass all - sky point source catalog ( psc ) as epoch # 1 and from the 2mass 6x point source working database / catalog as epoch # 2 .",
    "the latter catalog comprises a set of special observations made at the end of 2mass operations and taken with exposures six times longer than the main survey .",
    "the area covered by the 6x observations and hence the total area overlapped by both data sets is @xmath17580 sq .",
    "the epoch difference is 1 - 3 years .",
    "see figure  [ 6x_coverage ] for a graphical representation of the 6x coverage of the sky .    for each of the 137 6x nights ,",
    "a file was produced during 2mass 6x data processing that listed all of the objects in the 6x scan that failed to match a source within a 0@xmath35 search radius in the 2mass 1x data .",
    "this resulted in 824,383 missing sources . after removing objects that were within 10@xmath18 of the 6x scan edges , objects identified as known minor planets , objects that were confused with other detections in the scan , and sources of less than ideal photometric quality ( i.e. , sources for which none of the bands had photometric quality ph_qual = a ) , the source list was reduced to 1,181 sources .",
    "all of these were checked for additional problems by looking at side - by - side images of the field from both 2mass and the digital sky surveys .",
    "problems identified at this stage were usually false motions induced by source confusion or by extended morphology .    after these visual checks , a total of 359 confirmed sources remained , most of which are clearly visible on the dss plates .",
    "185 ( 51.5% ) of the sources are not listed in simbad , and 29 ( 8.1% ) have no counterpart within a 3@xmath30 radius in the usno - b catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "of these 29 , eight ( 2.2% of the original sample ) are 2mass - only sources because they have no visible counterpart on the dss plates once motion and faint counterparts ( such as i - only sources , not included in the usno - b catalog ) are accounted for .",
    "all eight of these infrared - only discoveries lie in front of or in the immediate vicinity of the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc , smc ) .",
    "this is no surprise since the lmc and smc were the two largest targets of the 2mass 6x observing campaign ( see figure  [ 6x_coverage ] ) .",
    "the second part of our survey used 1x data only .",
    "although the 2mass 1x survey was fundamentally a single - epoch coverage of the sky , approximately 30% of the sky was observed more than once in photometric conditions while the twin telescopes were in operation between 1997 and 2001 .",
    "figure 2 shows the sky coverage of the dual - epoch 1x data .",
    "slightly more than half of this area is in the ra and dec overlap regions between adjacent survey tiles .",
    "the remaining area is covered by tiles that were reobserved to improve minimum data quality , to provide additional survey validation , or to enable other scientific investigations .",
    "the 2mass survey point and extended source working databases contain source information extracted during pipeline data reduction of all survey observations , and may therefore contain multiple , independent measurements of sources detected in the regions of the sky observed more than once .",
    "the 2mass all - sky release catalogs were constructed from the working databases but used only one measurement of multiply - detected sources to maintain survey uniformity .    to conduct this proper motion survey we used the 2mass survey point source working database ( which is essentially a union of the 2mass all - sky point source catalog and the 2mass survey point source reject table ) and the 2mass survey merged point source information table .",
    "the merged point source information table contains the averaged positional and photometric measurements for sources with more than one detection in the point source working database and was created by positionally autocorrelating the point source survey working database to find `` groups '' of independent source extractions that fall within 1@xmath195 of each other .",
    "the mean and rms position , the mean and rms brightness , and various detection statistics were computed for each associated group of detections and entered into the merged source table .",
    "the merged source entries were also assigned warning flags if they could not be unambiguously separated from other nearby groups , if any of their constituents were resolved during pipeline data reduction , or if any of their constituents had measurements that were possibly contaminated by image artifacts .",
    "we selected proper motion candidates in the merged point source information table by using the irsa / gator search engine to search for groups that satisfy the following criteria ( conditions in parentheses after each description refer to the parameters listed in the merged point source table ) :    @xmath20 are detected on two or more independent survey scans ( sdet@xmath212 ) ;    @xmath20 have positional differences of at least @xmath22 ( 0.000111@xmath23 ) between the first and last detection epoch ( sep_jdmax@xmath210.000111 ) and , by default ( see above ) , positional differences of less than @xmath24 ;    @xmath20 have average j - band magnitudes brighter than 15.8 mag ( j_mavg@xmath2515.8 ) degrees , the magnitude range @xmath26 mag was searched only partially . ] ;    @xmath20 are not flagged as confused in the merging process ( gcnf=0 ) ;    @xmath20 contain no extended group members ( n_galcontam=0 ) ; and    @xmath20 contain no group members with contaminated measurements ( ce_flg=0 ) .",
    "candidate groups falling within 10 degrees of the galactic plane were further culled from the list , as source confusion there can severely limit the astrometric accuracy .",
    "the apparent proper motion of each candidate group was then computed by dividing the angular positional difference between the first and last epoch measurement by the time separating the observations .",
    "we imposed criteria of @xmath27 yr@xmath28 and epoch time differences @xmath21 0.2 yr for all of our proper motion candidates can be detected for cases with the smallest epoch difference , or @xmath29 for cases with the maximum difference . because the epoch difference varies from spot to spot ,",
    "it is not possible to place a fixed value on the maximum proper motion . ] .",
    "the constraint on epochal difference limits the search to a total area of @xmath173440 sq .",
    "see figure 6 of ",
    "a2.1 in the 2mass explanatory supplement ( @xcite ) .",
    "finder charts for each candidate were constructed and examined by eye .",
    "these charts were comprised of five different images : 2mass j , h , and k@xmath30 bands ; dss r , b , or v band ; and xdss r band .",
    "this eliminated spurious sources that clearly showed no motion between the longer time baseline afforded by the dss to 2mass comparison . in the final analysis we identified 2301",
    "proper motion candidates using these selections , 384 ( 16.7% ) of which are not listed in simbad . of these 2301 proper motion candidates , 225 ( 9.8% )",
    "have no counterpart within a 3@xmath30 radius in the usno - b catalog .",
    "a total of 37 ( 1.6% of the original sample ) are invisible by - eye on the dss b- , r- , and i - band images and are thus 2mass - only sources .      as an adjunct to this second survey , we searched for proper motion candidates having fainter 2mass j mags and/or smaller time and positional differences between the first and last 2mass epochs ; however , we restricted the search to portions of 2mass color - color space where mid- to late - l and mid- to late- t dwarfs lie .",
    "the common constraints for these color - based surveys were ",

    "a search of l dwarf color space ( specifically , @xmath31 mag and @xmath32 mag ) included the additional constraints @xmath33 deg , @xmath34 , and epoch difference @xmath35 yr .",
    "t dwarf color space had two searches performed on it , both using constraints @xmath36 mag , epoch difference @xmath35 yr , and total proper motion @xmath37/yr .",

    "the calculations are the same except that the positional difference comes from the earliest and latest epochs contained in the 2mass point source working database .",

    "the only 2mass proper motion candidates that lack a counterpart within our 3-arcsec radius are those that are too faint to be detected in the optical , those that have substantial motions ( @xmath521@xmath18/yr ) that will have moved them beyond our search radius in the @xmath173 years between the 2mass images and the given usno - b j2000.0 positions , or those with problematic usno - b measurements ( blends , sources in crowded fields , etc . ) .    finally , columns 19 - 22 report simbad info on each object , current as of mid-2008 , if a simbad match was found within 10 arcseconds of the 2mass psc position .",

    "we compare the 2mass motions to independent measurements from simbad and find an excellent correlation for those objects whose motions are the most significant ( @xmath54 , top panel ) .",
    "the correlation is not as tight for objects having 2mass motions of smaller significance ( bottom two panels ) , as one would expect .    despite the excellent correlation in the top panel ,",
    "it is important to understand why a few outliers still exist .",
    "one of these , 2mass j19570113@xmath535917285 has a 2mass - measured motion of @xmath55/yr , whereas the simbad value is @xmath56/yr .",

    "measuring the motion of 2mass j1957@xmath535917 using the 20-year baseline between the dss images and 2mass , we find a motion of @xmath59/yr , in agreement with the simbad value .",
    "hence , the 2mass - measured motion appears to be in error .",
    "2mass j1957@xmath535917 is fairly bright ( 7.0 - 8.0 mag in @xmath60 ) and stars in this brightness range are faint in the 2mass 1x 51-millisec read1 exposures but nearly saturated in the 1.3-sec read2-read1 exposures . for such objects , the astrometry can be less reliable than for stars just brighter ( which have higher snr and are more robustly measured on the read1 frames ) or just dimmer ( which are farther from saturation and easier to centroid in the read2-read1 frames ) .",
    "thus , the 2mass astrometry needs to be carefully scrutinized for objects in this near - infrared brightness range .    in the case of 2mass j0253",
    "+ 0608 , positional measures using the 45-year baseline between the earliest dss images and 2mass suggest a motion of @xmath61/yr , also in agreement with the simbad value .",
    "the two 2mass imaging epochs are separated by only nine months , which means that an additional positional difference of @xmath62 is being introduced between the 2mass images . in this case , a study of a few bright 2mass stars in the vicinity of this source show a @xmath63 difference between the reconstructed positions of the two epochs .",
    "2mass j0253 + 0608 is located near the end of a six - degree - long 2mass tile , and it appears that the astrometric solution for one of the two scans ( scan 037 on 991217n ) wandered off slightly , creating a @xmath63 systematic error at that epoch .",
    "it is only because this particular object shows appreciable , real motion between the dss and 2mass images that it survived our by - eye checks .",
    "figure  [ usnobpm_vs_2masspm ] shows the proper motion from the usno - b catalog plotted against the 2mass - measured value .",
    "there is more scatter in the correlations here than in figure  [ simbadpm_vs_2masspm ] but this is to be expected since the usno - b motions are measured in bulk and those from simbad are generally well vetted .",
    "in general the discrepancies here are caused by spurious measurements in the usno - b .",
    "one example of this , from the upper panel of the figure , is 2mass j06105984@xmath536512200 ( lhs 1832 ) whose 2mass motion of @xmath64/yr and usno - b motion of @xmath65/yr are in clear disagreement .",
    "simbad lists this object as having @xmath66/yr , agreeing within one sigma of the 2mass measurement .",
    "the usno - b measurement is presumably the result of an incorrect association across epochs because this is a very crowded field in the outskirts of the large magellanic cloud .",
    "a similar situation holds true for the star 2mass j01132818@xmath537056507 , whose discrepancy is obvious on the middle panel of figure  [ usnobpm_vs_2masspm ] .",
    "this is the brighter component of the common proper motion pair ccdm j01135 - 7057ab , which lies in another crowded field , this time in the outskirts of the small magellanic cloud .",
    "2mass measures identical motions of @xmath67/yr for the two objects , whereas usno - b reports non - identical and much higher values of @xmath68/yr and @xmath69/yr for the a and b components , respectively .",
    "comparison of the dss and 2mass images , which represent a 23-year baseline , confirm the 2mass measures .",
    "figure  [ simbadpm_vs_2masspm_angles ] and figure  [ usnobpm_vs_2masspm_angles ] show the correlation between measurements of the position angle . as with the two previous figures , these show an excellent correlation for those objects with 2mass motions @xmath70 , with the usno - b agreement again being less tight than that of simbad .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ simbadpm_vs_2masspm_angles ] shows only one highly discrepant point , that of 2mass j02192807@xmath531938416 , a previously known l1 dwarf whose 2mass measurement of @xmath71 disagrees with the simbad value of @xmath72 , which itself appears to originate from the usno - b catalog .",
    "a comparison of the dss r- and i - band images with 2mass images shows that the 2mass value appears to be correct , the usno - b value having been calculated from optical data with lower snr .",
    "these plots show that the 2mass - measured proper motions agree well with published values .",
    "nonetheless , like any other catalog derived from bulk - measured motions , some problems persist so users are advised to use caution and to perform their own quality assurance of the results before proceeding with analysis or follow - up .",
    "on average , objects closer to the sun should have larger proper motions than those more distant , so proper motion should be proportional to trigonometric parallax . with this in mind , @xcite substituted proper motion , @xmath7 , for parallax , @xmath73 , in the equation for distance modulus and invented a quantity , @xmath10 , which he referred to as the reduced proper motion .",
    "this is defined by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a particular photometric band such as 2mass j. the quantity @xmath10 can be used to create a plot much like an hr diagram , which can then be used to select potentially nearby stars for further follow - up .",
    "however , stars of higher than average kinematics will have artificially faint values of @xmath10 , making them also stand out on such a diagram .",
    "thus , reduced proper motion is also a valuable quantity for selecting potentially old objects for further follow - up .",
    "figure  [ red_motion_vs_jk ] shows @xmath51 , the reduced proper motion at j - band , plotted against @xmath76 color for objects in the 2mass proper motion sample .",

    "subdwarfs tend to be bluer in near - infrared color than their higher metallicity counterparts and because they are older tend to have higher motions as well .",
    "this pushes them down and to the left relative to normal field objects .",
    "the reason that the concentration of objects found with @xmath81 tends to show a _ blueward _",

    ", in prep . )",
    "suffix as further discussed in   [ lowg - section ] .",

    "spectral classification in the near - infrared should be accomplished the same way as in the optical .",
    "surprisingly , however , a set of near - infrared m and l dwarf anchors has never been established although those for t dwarfs have been ( @xcite ) .",
    "previous near - infrared classifications , such as those in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , have relied on comparing a target object s spectral ratios with those same ratios derived for an object of known optical type .",
    "these optically classified comparison objects , however , might not necessarily create a smooth near - infared spectral sequence across all of the j , h , k spectral windows ( 1.0 - 2.5 @xmath7 m ) since that was not a requirement .",
    "now that a very large number of spectra have been acquired over these wavelengths ( e.g. , the suite of spex prism data available at http://www.browndwarfs.org/spexprism as well as the set of spex spectra acquired here ) , it is now possible to create a grid of spectra whose near - infrared features change smoothly and monotonically as a function of type .",
    "this spectral morphological sequence was built to satisfy the following properties :    \\(1 ) the near - infrared spectral standards should have near - infrared types identical or very close to the types assigned to them in the optical . in this way",
    "it can be assured that a random m or l dwarf will , on average , have identical or very similar optical and near - infrared classifications .",
    "primary standards from the optical classification sequence have been reused here if they satisfy the other criteria below .",
    "\\(2 ) the near - infrared color of each primary standard should be as close as possible to the median @xmath76 color of other objects with that same optical classification .",
    "median colors as a function of optical type are given in table 3 of @xcite for early- to mid - m dwarfs and figure 14 of @xcite for late - m and l dwarfs .",
    "the goal of this criterion is to assure that each near - infrared standard describes the average color ( and hence , presumably , overall morphological shape over the j , h , and k bandpasses ) of objects in that class .",
    "\\(3 ) the resulting spectral sequence should be smoothly continuous in morphology .",
    "that is , each primary standard should be analagous to a frame in a movie , where each frame is only subtly different from the frames ( standards ) on either side .    in cases where multiple objects at a single class met the above three requirements",
    ", objects were given preference if they were relatively bright or if they fell within 30 degrees of the celestial equator .",
    "the resulting m0-l9 near - infrared primary standards are listed in table  [ nir_stds ] , and the full m0-t8 near - infrared spectral sequence is illustrated in figure  [ nir_m_stds ] , figure  [ nir_l_stds ] , and figure  [ nir_t_stds ] .",
    "it should be noted that no suitable near - infrared l1 standard was found with an optical type of l1 , so an object of optical type l1.5 was used instead .",
    "likewise , at near - infrared type l7 an object of optical type l6 was used .",
    "the optical spectral sequence does not include an l9 class  in fact , there is a rather large jump in morphology between known optical l8 dwarfs and the optical t0 standard ( @xcite )  so an optical l8 that bridged the morphological gap between the near - infrared l8 standard and the near - infrared t0 standard of @xcite was used in its place .    with this suite of standards in hand , near - infrared spectral classifications for the spex , nirspec , and osiris data",
    "were performed as follows .",
    "each target spectrum was normalized to one at 1.28 @xmath7 m and compared to the near - infrared spectral standards from figure  [ nir_m_stds ] , figure  [ nir_l_stds ] , and figure  [ nir_t_stds ] normalized the same way .",
    "the core near - infrared type was determined _ only _ from the 0.9 - 1.4 @xmath7 m portion . with that best match in hand , the corresponding goodness of fit to the same spectral standard from 1.4 - 2.5 @xmath7",
    "m was judged . in most cases",
    "the same spectral standard also provided the best fit in this region .",
    "in other cases , the target spectrum was notably much bluer or redder so the fit across the h and k windows was very poor despite the excellent fit in the j window .",
    "these objects were given suffixes of `` blue '' or `` red '' ( or for ones only slightly discrepant , `` sl .",
    "blue '' or `` sl . red '' ) to denote the slope of the spectrum relative to the standard .",
    "other spectra simply had no good match even in the 0.9 - 1.4 @xmath7 m window , so those were given a suffix of `` pec '' .",
    "some of these were deemed to be either low - gravity ( `` low - g '' ) or low - metallicity ( prefix of `` sd '' ) , as discussed further in the sections that follow .",
    "interesting objects and comparable , previously published objects of similar type are discussed below and tabulated in tables [ lowg_table ] through [ other_table ] . for our noteworthy discoveries having high - quality spectra with @xmath105",
    ", we also derive radial velocities then derive distance estimates and tangential velocities to compute total space motions in table [ rv_table ] .",
    "radial velocities are derived using standard cross - correlation to objects of known radial velocity and similar spectral type .",
    "because of the relativey low - resolution of our spectra , these radial velocity measurements typically have large uncertainties , which we conservatively overestimate to be @xmath1750 km / s .",
    "some of the peculiar late - m and l dwarf spectra were recognized as being unusual because they have much lower gravity than normal field dwarfs .",
    "low gravity in these objects is the observational by - product of youth .",
    "these objects are less massive than an older dwarf of the same temperature ( i.e. , at the same mass , younger objects have had less time to cool ) and have more distended atmospheres because they have not yet completed their gravitational contraction . both effects contribute to the lowering of the gravity relative to a collapsed , more massive object of similar temperature .",
    "the first late - m dwarfs exhibiting the telltale signs of low - gravity were identified over a decade ago in young clusters such as the pleiades ( @xcite ) , the @xmath106 ophiuchi star formation region ( @xcite ) , and the taurus - auriga complex ( @xcite ) .",
    "many other low - gravity late - m dwarfs are now recognized both in clusters as well as in loose , young associations .",
    "the first l dwarf recognized as young through its low - gravity features was the field l0 dwarf 2mass j01415823@xmath534633574 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this object , predicted to be a member of either the 12 myr old @xmath102 pictoris moving group or the 30 myr old tucana - horologium association from its sky location and low - gravity signatures , now has a proper motion measurement by @xcite that is statistically consistent with membership in tucana - horologium .",
    "this leads to a predicted distance of 44@xmath448 pc and radial velocity of @xmath17 + 8 km / s ( mamajek , priv .",
    "comm . ) , both of which await verification .",
    "many other low - gravity field m and l dwarfs have now been recognized because of their low - gravity signatures ( @xcite ) , and these are now the targets of dedicated astrometric and radial velocity programs that will establish the @xmath107 space motions needed to confirm membership in young moving groups .    it has been shown that 7.6%@xmath441.6% of field",
    "l dwarfs exhibit signs of lower gravity and are presumably younger than 100 myr , in agreement with theoretical expectations ( @xcite ) . however , proper motion studies are biased toward objects with halo kinematics , so one would not expect a significant contribution by young objects .",
    "indeed , all six of our young discoveries below have measured proper motions that are within one or two sigma of zero and were primarily targetted for follow - up due to their red colors .",
    "we identify six objects , listed in table  [ lowg_table ] , that show the hallmarks of lower gravity .",

    "although high , this velocity is not as high as the average tangential velocity of 263.5 km / s found for late - m and l subdwarfs in @xcite . given that the l subdwarfs comprising the bulk of the @xcite sample are much bluer than those found here  mainly because the earliest l subdwarf discoveries were made as by - products of t dwarf searches focused on very blue objects in j - k@xmath30 color  they may also represent a substantially more metal poor and older population than those found here . nonetheless , our new l subdwarf discoveries are kinematically distinct from the field l dwarf population , whose median transverse velocity is 24.5 km / s ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are several reason to believe that these three l subdwarfs , with the possible exception of the enigmatic 2mass j1756 + 2815 , are objects low in metallicity : ( 1 ) stronger hydride bands are the by - product of an atmosphere where metal - metal molecules such as tio or vo are less abundant . with less absorption by the oxides , the hydride bandstrengths are more prominent .",
    "( 2 ) in a cool , metal - deficient atmosphere , the relative absorption by collision - induced h@xmath92 is stronger than in an atmosphere with a rich array of lines and bands from metal - bearing species .",
    "because this broad h@xmath92 absorption is strongest at h- and k - bands ( @xcite ) , this leads to a bluer near - infrared continuum , and hence bluer j - k@xmath30 color , for l subdwarfs when compared to l dwarfs of higher metallicity ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 3 ) somewhat counterintuitively , the presence of metal lines ( such as and ) and the increased strengths of the alkali lines ( , , , and ) in low - temperature atmospheres may indicate retarded condensate formation in a metal - poor environment .",
    "the rarity of metal atoms in the atmosphere means that condensates are more difficult to form , and thus these metals remain in the atmosphere to lower temperatures .",
    "using one of these new discoveries ( 2mass j1158 + 0435 ) along with a new discovery from the sdss team ( sdss j1416 + 1348 ; schmidt et al .",
    "submitted ) , we are able to build an empirical sequence in metallicity for spectral type l7 .",
    "figure [ sdl7s_opt ] and figure [ sdl7s_nir ] show the optical and near - infrared spectra of these two objects compared to the standard l7 , denis j0205@xmath531159 ( presumably of solar metallicity ) , and the first late - l subdwarf discovered , 2mass j05325346 + 8246465 .",
    "2mass j1158 + 0435 and sdss j1416 + 1348 are very similar in spectral appearance , although the sdss object shows slightly stronger hydride bands ( cah , crh , and feh ) , slightly stronger tio , and a bluer near - infrared continuum ( by 0.14 mag in j - k@xmath30 ) .",
    "the spectrum of 2mass j0532 + 8246 is even more extreme than these , particularly in the strength of its cah band and in its overall near - infrared color , which is 0.77 mag bluer than in sdss j1416 + 1348 .",
    "( the slightly weaker tio , crh , and feh bands in 2mass j0532 + 8246 may indicate that this object is a bit later in type than the other two subdwarf comparisons . ) because of its more extreme nature , we propose that 2mass j0532 + 8246 should actually be labelled as an esdl7 to indicate an even more unusual spectral morphology .",
    "further investigation will be needed to determine if such morphological traits easily translate into a lower value of [ fe / h ] . in one example , the sdl5 2mass j06164006@xmath536407194 has a spectral morphology that is not nearly as abnormal as that of 2mass j0532 + 8246 yet kinematic investigations place the former in the outer halo ( @xcite ) and the latter in the inner halo ( @xcite ) .",
    "single objects may not be representative of their population , however , so larger collections of l subdwarfs will be needed to further gauge the variation in spectral appearance of these two , very old samples .",
    "although l subdwarfs have particularly blue @xmath76 colors due to increased relative collision - induced opacity by h@xmath92 at @xmath10- and @xmath11-bands , there is a class of l dwarfs that shows unusually blue near - infrared colors not obviously caused by low metallicity .",
    "these so called `` blue l dwarfs '' have unusually blue @xmath76 colors for their optical spectral types and were first pointed out in follow - up of 2mass sources by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "subsequent follow - up of sdss sources revealed objects with peculiar near - infrared spectral morphologies . specifically , spectral indices measuring the depth of h@xmath92o bands versus those measuring feh or give discordant spectral types , with the h@xmath92o - based index always suggesting a much later l subclass ( @xcite ) .",
    "some of these blue l dwarfs are suspected to be the composite spectra of an l dwarf + tdwarf binary ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one intriguing blue l dwarf , 2mass j11263991@xmath535003550 , for which binarity seems not to be the cause , has been extensively studied by @xcite and @xcite . the latter authors argue that the spectral features are the result of thin and/or large - grained clouds , the cause for which appears not to be easily attributable to either surface gravity or low metallicity .",
    "another example  an object known as 2mass j17114559 + 4028578 ( g 203 - 50b )  is particularly interesting because it shares common proper motion with an m dwarf whose optical spectrum suggests a metallicity very similar to that of the sun ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite performed a kinematic study of ten unusually blue l dwarfs and found a median transverse velocity of 99@xmath4447 km / s , substantially larger than that of the field l dwarf population ( 24.5 km / s ; @xcite ) but still smaller than the tranverse velocity for m subdwarfs ( 196@xmath4491 km / s ) .",
    "this suggests that many of the blue l dwarfs may be old , though not as old as the halo population .",
    "it therefore remains a possibility that these objects represent a slightly lower - metallicity population than normal field dwarfs but not so low in metal content that they can be confidently labeled as subdwarfs .",
    "for very cool atmospheres such as these , a small change in metal content can perhaps have more prominent effects on the formation of condensates ( i.e. , cloud properties ) than on the strength of gas phase molecular transitions .    as a result of our proper motion study",
