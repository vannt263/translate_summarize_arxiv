    "searching for signals of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is an essential part of experiments at modern colliders .",
    "new phenomena could be discovered through deviations of observed quantities from the predicted sm background .",
    "however , observables in experiments at hadron colliders can be calculated with significant theoretical uncertainties coming mainly from the parton distribution functions of initial states and complicated structure of hadronic final states .",
    "in this situation one can only hope to discover the most prominent signals in the most clear processes .",
    "this is the reason to pay attention to searching for resonances of new heavy particles decaying into lepton pairs .",
    "a neutral vector boson ( @xmath0 boson ) is probably the most perspective intermediate state in scattering processes of quarks and leptons which could be discovered in the tevatron and lhc experiments . at the parton level it appears in the annihilation channel",
    ", its mass is allowed to be of order 1 tev by current experimental constraints , and it is a necessary component of popular grand unification theories and other models with extended gauge sector ( see @xcite for review ) .    in general , the accurate description of @xmath0 resonance requires to consider scattering amplitudes with intermediate virtual states .",
    "but if the resonance is a narrow one , then it can be described in a more simple way by a small number of convenient characteristics of the production and the decay of the particle . in this approach",
    "it is enough to set the @xmath0 mass and width , the production cross - section , and the branching ratio into the final state .",
    "supposing some numbers for the @xmath0 parameters in various estimates one could and , in principle , would take into account all the available experimental constraints on @xmath0 from previous experiments .",
    "of course , effects of @xmath0 boson can be calculated in details for each specific model beyond the sm .",
    "such estimates are widely presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "some set of popular @xmath2 based models and left - right models is usually considered in this approach . however , probing the set we can still miss the actual @xmath0 model . in this regard , it is useful to complement model - dependent @xmath0 searching by some kind of model - independent analysis , i.e. the analysis covering a lot of models .",
    "almost all of the usually considered models belong to the models with so - called abelian @xmath0 boson . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found the relations which hold in any model containing the abelian @xmath0 boson and satisfying the following conditions :    * only one neutral vector boson exists at energy scale about 1 - 10 tev , * the @xmath0 boson can be phenomenologically described by the effective lagrangian @xcite at low energies , * the @xmath0 boson and other possible heavy particles are decoupled at considered energies , and the theory beyond the @xmath0 decoupling scale is either one- or two - higgs - doublet standard model ( thdm ) , * the sm gauge group is a subgroup of possible extended gauge group of the underlying theory .",
    "so , the only origin of possible tree - level @xmath0 interactions to the sm vector bosons is the @xmath3@xmath0 mixing .",
    "these relations cover almost all of the usually considered set of models ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "they require the same @xmath0 couplings to the left - handed fermion currents within any sm doublet and the universal absolute value of the @xmath0 couplings to the axial - vector currents for all the massive sm fermions .",
    "the relations reduce significantly the number of unknown @xmath0 parameters .",
    "this allows to constrain the parameters by existing experiments as well as to predict the quantities used in the analysis of the tevatron and lhc experiments .",
    "recently we summarized the information about @xmath0 couplings to leptons and quarks which can be extracted from the lep experiments @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 coupling to axial - vector currents was constrained by both lep i and lep ii @xmath4 data . in different processes",
    "it shows hints at about 1@xmath1 confidence level ( cl ) with the approximately same maximum - likelihood ( ml ) value .",
    "this value can be used in estimates of observables in the tevatron and lhc experiments . as for the couplings to vector currents , the @xmath0 coupling constant to electron",
    "can be constrained by the lep ii @xmath5 data only .",
    "although the backward scattering shows a signal at the 2@xmath1 cl , the ml value is outside of the @xmath6 cl interval calculated by the complete set of bins .",
    "in this situation we refrain from using that ml value in our estimates .",
    "nevertheless , the vector coupling is constrained at @xmath6 cl .",
    "the upper bound on the electron vector coupling agrees closely with the corresponding upper bound on the axial - vector coupling .",
    "this fact allows us to suppose the rest of vector couplings to be constrained by the same value , since no evident signals were discovered in other scattering processes measured by the lep collaborations .",
    "it is worth to note that all the conclusions derived from the lep data are also valid if one considers the thdm as the low - energy theory instead of the usual minimal sm .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to obtain estimates for the @xmath0 parameters used in searching for the narrow resonance by applying the lep constraints on the @xmath0 couplings .",
    "both the minimal sm and the thdm will be considered as the low - energy theory .",

    "first of all , the @xmath0 interactions of renormalizable types are to be dominant at low energies @xmath14 .",
    "the non - renormalizable interactions generated at high energies due to radiation corrections are suppressed by the inverse heavy mass @xmath15 ( or by other heavier scales @xmath16 ) and therefore at low energies can be neglected .",
    "it is also assumed that the @xmath17 is the only neutral vector boson with the mass @xmath18 .",
    "it is obvious that the lagrangian ( [ zzplagr ] ) requires the @xmath17 boson to enter the theory as a gauge field through covariant derivatives with a corresponding charge .",
    "this idea allows also to introduce @xmath0 couplings to sm scalar and vector fields .",
    "although the latter couplings are inessential in the analysis of the @xmath0 production cross - section in fermion collisions , they contribute to the @xmath0 width .",
    "we assume that the @xmath19 gauge group of the sm is a subgroup of the gut group . in this case , a product of generators associated with the sm subgroup is a linear combination of these generators . as a consequence ,",
    "all the structure constants connecting two sm gauge bosons with @xmath17 have to be zero .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 interactions to the sm gauge fields at the tree level are possible due to a @xmath3@xmath0 mixing only",
    ".    we will consider both the sm and the thdm as the low - energy theory .",
    "the explicit lagrangian describing @xmath0 couplings to the sm fields can be found in appendix [ sec : full_lagr ] .",

    "thus , they describe correlations between @xmath0 couplings for a wide set of models beyond the sm .",

    "the couplings of the abelian @xmath0 to the axial - vector fermion current have a universal absolute value .",

    "so it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless couplings @xmath30 which are constrained by experiments .",

    "all the @xmath0 couplings to the sm scalar and vector bosons can be determined by the universal axial - vector constant @xmath9 and can be constrained .",

    "( [ eq : factorwidth ] ) through the constants ( [ avbar ] ) one can see that the width is proportional to @xmath90 and quadratic combinations of couplings @xmath34 , @xmath91 .",
    "thus it is convenient to introduce quantity @xmath92 which is independent of @xmath66 in our estimates .    to calculate @xmath93 numerically one has to choose values of the unknown masses of the sm scalar particles .",

    "this asymmetry arises from the term @xmath126 in ( [ eq : factorwidth ] ) .",

    "we can expect this @xmath0 boson with the mass between 400 gev and 1.2 tev .",
    "in this section we adduce the scalar , fermion , yukawa and gauge sectors of the lagrangian that is used for the calculations .",
    "let @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) be two complex scalar doublets : @xmath170 where @xmath171 marks corresponding vacuum expectation values , @xmath172 are complex fields , and @xmath173 , @xmath174 are real fields . by diagonalizing the quadratic terms of the scalar potential @xmath175 one obtains the mass eigenstates : two neutral @xmath176-even scalar particles , @xmath106 and @xmath105 , the neutral @xmath176-odd scalar particle , @xmath103 , the goldstone boson partner of the @xmath3 boson , @xmath177 , the charged higgs field , @xmath178 , and the goldstone field associated with the @xmath179 boson , @xmath180 : @xmath181 where @xmath182 and the angle @xmath183 is determined by the explicit form of the potential @xmath175 .",
    "for instance , the @xmath176-conserving potential , which has only @xmath176-invariant minima , can be used @xcite : @xmath184   + \\lambda_3 ( \\mbox{re}[\\phi^\\dagger_1 \\phi_2])^2   \\nonumber\\\\ & &   + \\lambda_4 ( \\mbox{im}[\\phi^\\dagger_1 \\phi_2])^2   + \\lambda_5 ( \\phi^\\dagger_1 \\phi_1 ) ( \\phi^\\dagger_2 \\phi_2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is consistent with the absence of the tree - level flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) in the fermion sector .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath183 is @xcite @xmath185    the @xmath0 coupling to the scalar doublets can be parametrized in a model independent way as follows @xcite : @xmath186 where @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 are the charges associated with the @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and the @xmath17 gauge groups , respectively , @xmath192 are the pauli matrices , @xmath193 is the generator corresponding to the gauge group of the @xmath17 boson , and @xmath194 is the @xmath191 hypercharge .",
    "the condition @xmath195 guarantees that the vacuum is invariant with respect to the gauge group of photon .    the vector bosons , @xmath53 , @xmath3 , and @xmath17 , are related with the symmetry eigenstates as follows : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the adopted in the sm value of the weinberg angle , and @xmath198 as is seen , the mixing angle @xmath11 is of order @xmath199 .",
    "that results in the corrections of order @xmath200 to the interactions between the sm particles . to avoid the tree - level mixing of the @xmath3 boson and the physical scalar field @xmath103 one has to impose the condition @xmath201 .",

    "we use the @xmath0 couplings to the vector and axial - vector fermion currents defined as @xmath210 the lagrangian ( [ l : fermion ] ) leads to the interactions between the fermions and the @xmath3 and @xmath0 mass eigenstates described by ( [ zzplagr ] ) .",
    "renormalizable interactions of fermions and scalars are described by the yukawa lagrangian . to avoid the existence of the tree - level fcnc s one has to ensure that at the diagonalization of the fermion mass matrix the diagonalization of the scalar - fermion couplings is automatically fulfilled . in this case",
