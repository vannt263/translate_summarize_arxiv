    "coronal loops in active regions are likely to be heated by joule dissipation of highly structured electric currents .",
    "the formation of small scales in the spatial distribution of electric currents is necessary to enhance magnetic energy dissipation and therefore provide sufficient heating to the plasma confined in these loops .",
    "various scenarios of how these fine scale structures might be generated have been proposed , such as the spontaneous formation of tangential discontinuities ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the development of an energy cascade driven by random footpoint motions on a force - free configuration ( @xcite ) , or the direct energy cascade associated to a fully turbulent magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) regime ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these rather different models share in common the dominant role of nonlinearities in generating fine spatial structure .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the dynamics of a coronal loop driven by footpoint motions is described by the mhd equations .",
    "since the kinetic ( @xmath3 ) and magnetic ( @xmath4 ) reynolds numbers in coronal active regions are extremely large ( @xmath5 ) , we expect footpoint motions to drive the loop into a strongly turbulent mhd regime .",
    "footpoint motions whose lengthscales are much smaller than the loop length cause the coronal plasma to move in planes perpendicular to the axial magnetic field , generating a small transverse magnetic field component . in  2 we model this coupling to simulate the driving action of footpoint motions on a generic transverse section of the loop .",
    "the numerical technique used for the integration of the two - dimensional mhd equations is described in  3 . in ",
    "4 we report the energy dissipation rate that we obtain , and a statistical analysis of dissipation events is presented in  5 . finally , the relevant results of this paper are summarized in  6 .",
    "the dynamics of a coronal loop with a uniform magnetic field @xmath6 , length @xmath7 and transverse section @xmath8 , can be modeled by the rmhd equations ( @xcite ) : @xmath9 +        \\eta \\nabla \\sp2 a   \\label{eq : rmhda}\\ ] ] @xmath10 - [ a , j ] +       \\nu \\nabla \\sp2 w \\label{eq : rmhdw}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the alfven speed , @xmath12 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath13 is the plasma resistivity , @xmath14 is the stream function , @xmath15 is the vector potential , @xmath16 is the fluid vorticity , @xmath17 is the electric current density and @xmath18={\\bf z } \\cdot { \\bf \\nabla}u \\times { \\bf \\nabla}v$ ] . for given photospheric motions applied at the footpoints ( plates @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) horizontal velocity and magnetic field components develop in the interior of the loop , given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the rmhd equations can be regarded as describing a set of two - dimensional mhd systems stacked along the loop axis and interacting among themselves through the @xmath23 terms . for simplicity , hereafter we study the evolution of a generic two - dimensional slice of a loop to which end we model the @xmath23 terms as external forces ( see @xcite for a similar approach ) .",
    "we assume the vector potential to be independent of @xmath24 and the stream function to interpolate linearly between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the stream function for the photospheric velocity field .",
    "these assumptions yield @xmath28 ( in ) and @xmath29 ( in ) and correspond to an idealized scenario where the magnetic stress distributes uniformly throughout the loop .",
    "the 2d equations for a generic transverse slice of a loop become , @xmath30 + \\eta \\nabla \\sp2 a + f \\label{eq : dta}\\ ] ] @xmath31 - [ a , j ] + \\nu \\nabla \\sp2 w \\label{eq : dtw}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 .",
    "we performed numerical simulations of eqs ( [ eq : dta])-([eq : dtw ] ) on a square box of sides @xmath33 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the magnetic vector potential and the stream function are expanded in fourier series . to be able to perform long - time integrations",
    ", we worked with a moderate resolution version of the code ( @xmath34 grid points ) .",
    "the code is of the pseudo - spectral type , with @xmath35 de - aliasing ( @xcite ) . the temporal integration scheme is a fifth order predictor - corrector , to achieve almost exact energy balance over our extended time simulations .",
    "we turn eqs ( [ eq : dta])-([eq : dtw ] ) into a dimensionless version , choosing @xmath36 and @xmath7 as the units for transverse and longitudinal distances , and @xmath37 as the unit for velocities ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 : typical photospheric velocity ) , since the field intensities are determined by the forcing strength .",
    "the dimensionless dissipation coefficients are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the forcing is constant in time and non zero only in a narrow band in @xmath42-space corresponding to @xmath43 . in spite of the narrow forcing and",
    "even though velocity and magnetic fields are initially zero , non - linear terms quickly populate all the modes across the spectrum and a stationary turbulent state is reached .",
    "to restore the dimensions to our numerical results , we used typical values for the solar corona : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    fig .",
    "1 shows magnetic and kinetic energy vs time .",
    "the behavior of both energies is highly intermittent despite the fact that the forcing is constant and coherent .",
    "this kind of behavior is usually called internal intermittency , to emphasize the fact that the rapid fluctuations are not induced by an external random forcing . also , note",
    "that magnetic energy is about one order of magnitude larger than kinetic energy .",
    "the energy dissipation rate is also a strongly intermittent quantity as shown in fig .",
    "2 . for turbulent systems at large reynolds numbers ,",
    "the dissipation rate in the stationary regime is expected to be independent of the reynolds number r ( @xcite ) . for the rather moderate reynolds number simulations reported here , a weak ( monotonically increasing ) dependence of the dissipation rate with r",
    "still remains ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the total dissipation rate for the typical numbers listed above is @xmath50 .",
    "we can transform the heating rate into an energy influx from the photosphere , by simply dividing by twice the transverse area ( because we have two boundaries ) , i.e. @xmath51 . in",
    "we show the quantitative value of the energy flux as well as the explicit dependence with the relevant parameters of the problem , @xmath52 this energy flux compares quite favorably with the heating requirements for active regions , which span the range @xmath53 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we associate the peaks of energy dissipation displayed in fig . 2 to the so - called nanoflares ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the occurrence rate for these nano - events , i.e. the number of events per unit energy and time @xmath54 so that , @xmath55 is the total number of events per unit time and @xmath56 is the total heating rate ( in @xmath57 ) contributed by all events in the energy range @xmath58 $ ] . a simple inspection to the @xmath59 time series shown in fig .",
    "2 indicates that these events are in a highly concentrated or piled - up regime , i.e. their event rate @xmath60 multiplied by their typical duration is much larger than unity . at",
    "any given time , many events are going on simultaneously .",
    "this piled - up scenario is a serious drawback against performing any kind of statistical analysis . to overcome this difficulty we define an event in the following fashion : ( 1 ) we set a threshold heating rate @xmath61 on the time series displayed in fig . 2 , of the order of its time average , ( 2 ) events are excesses of dissipation which start when @xmath59 surpasses @xmath61 and finish when @xmath59 returns below @xmath61 .",
    "once a particular threshold is set , we perform a statistical analysis of the events , keeping track of their peak values , durations and total energy content .",
    "the implicit assumption behind our working definition , is that the small fraction of events that emerge over the threshold are statistically representative of the whole set .",
    "we do not make any attempt to prove this assertion , which therefore remains as a working hypothesis .    among the interesting results of this statistical analysis",
    ", we find a significant correlation between the energy and duration of events like @xmath62 ( @xcite ) , which is consistent with the correlation reported by @xcite from hard x - ray observations and by @xcite for an avalanche model of flare occurrences .",
    "perhaps the most important result is that the occurrence rate as a function of energy displays a power law behavior @xmath63 in the energy range spanned from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "we define the constant @xmath66 in so that the heating rate computed from matches the total heating rate from our simulation ( see ) .",
    "figure 3 shows our occurrence rate , displaying the power law behavior indicated in . for comparison",
    ", we also plotted the occurrence rate for transient brightenings derived by @xcite ( slope between 1.5 - 1.6 ) from yohkoh soft x - ray observations and by @xcite ( slope 1.53 ) from smm hard x - ray data .",
    "also , we obtained the distribution of events as a function of peak fluxes which is a power law with slope @xmath67 .",
    "this slope is consistent with the one derived by @xcite ( 1.68 ) from x - ray events and somewhat flatter than those reported by @xcite ( 1.8 ) .",
    "note that the slopes derived from x - ray observations assume that the luminosity in x - rays is proportional to the dissipated energy .",
    "@xcite criticize this assumption after comparing the uv and x - ray emission for several microflares and find that slopes derived from x - rays become slightly steeper when corrected for this effect .",
    "the remarkable correspondence between the rates plotted in fig .",
    "3 , is indicative of the presence of a common physical process behind the dissipation events ranging from @xmath68 or less , to @xmath69 for the largest flares . since in all cases the index of the power law remains smaller than two , implies that the contribution to energy dissipation in a given energy range ( @xmath70 $ ] ) is dominated by the most energetic events ( i.e. @xmath71 ) . according to this result ,",
    "the relatively infrequent large energy events contribute more to the heating rate than the much more numerous small energy events .",
    "this assertion might only change if indications of a turn - up of the slope ( to an index larger than two ) are found at low energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "in the present paper we simulate the dynamics of a transverse section of a solar coronal loop through an externally driven two - dimensional mhd code . the relevant results of this study are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) for an external forcing which is narrowband in wavenumber , we find that the system becomes strongly turbulent and after about twenty photospheric turnover times a stationary turbulent regime is reached , ( 2 ) the energy dissipation rate obtained for typical footpoint velocities is consistent with the power necessary to heat active region loops ( @xmath72 ) , ( 3 ) the energy dissipation rate displays a highly intermittent behavior , which is a ubiquitous characteristic of turbulent systems , ( 4 ) we associate the elementary events that compose this intermittent heating rate to the so - called nanoflare events described by @xcite .",
    "a statistical analysis of the events performed on a long term numerical simulation ( about @xmath73 turnover times ) shows a power law event rate , going like @xmath74 , which is remarkably consistent with the statistics of flare occurrence derived from observations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ."
