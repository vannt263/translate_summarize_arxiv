    "a major hindrance to the development of quantum gravity is the family of issues known as the problem of time @xcite .",
    "simply put , the problem is one of labeling states to record the evolution of physical quantities . in the canonical formulation , the problem of time arises because the hamiltonian , which encodes the dynamics , is a constraint ; since the observables commute with the constraints , they become `` frozen '' .",
    "thus , it appears that there are no dynamical observables in the theory . in the path integral formulation ,",
    "the problem arises both in finding a covariant way of expressing the initial and final states of geometry and in finding a measure such that the propagator sums over physically distinct configurations .",
    "one approach to this problem is to abandon all reference to spatial geometries and instead consider only spacetime quantities .",
    "however , since much of classical and quantum physics is conceptualized in terms of moment - of - time and initial value formulations , it is important to know whether a covariant interpretation of spatial hypersurfaces is at all possible .",
    "the hartle - hawking no - boundary proposal , for example , provides one such interpretation within the framework of euclidean sum - over - histories quantum gravity @xcite .    we examine this question within the causal set approach to quantum gravity .",
    "our analysis suggests a general prescription for other sum - over - histories approaches to quantum gravity : instead of summing over histories between geometries at fixed times the measure is on `` completed '' histories containing transitions between the spatial hypersurfaces",
    ". this may be particularly relevant to the causal dynamical triangulation ( cdt ) approach to quantising gravity in which one considers `` sufficiently '' completed histories @xcite .",
    "in causal set quantum gravity , the underlying structure is a causal set @xmath0 , which is a locally finite partial order @xcite : i.e. , @xmath0 is a set with an order relation @xmath1 which is transitive ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , irreflexive ( @xmath4 ) and locally finite ( @xmath5 ) for any @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denotes set - cardinality . )",
    "the spacetime continuum arises as an approximation , rather than a limit of the theory , and quantities such as geometry and topology correspond to macroscopic degrees of freedom , analogous to thermodynamic quantities such as pressure and temperature for a gas of particles .",
    "while we expect a causal set to include both microscopic and macroscopic physical information , the latter should be well - described by physics in the continuum approximation .",
    "a continuum manifold @xmath10 is said to approximate a causal set @xmath0 if and only if there exists a faithful embedding @xmath11 .",
    "the faithful embedding requires that the causal relations induced by the embedding agree with the order relation in @xmath0 , and that the embedded points are sprinkled randomly via a poisson process , at a spacetime density @xmath12 , with high probability .",
    "a causal set embedded in a spacetime @xmath10 thus resembles a random spacetime lattice , where a link between two points implies a causal relation . in this lattice ,",
    "a set of unrelated elements corresponds to a set of mutually spacelike events .    in the continuum",
    ", we define a _ moment - of - time surface ( mots ) _ to be a spacelike , acausal , edgeless hypersurface such that any other spacetime event is either to its causal future or past .",
    "this definition captures our requirement that the spatial hypersurface represent a global moment - of - time .",
    "an example of a mots is a cauchy hypersurface in a globally hyperbolic spacetime . in the discrete context of causal sets ,",
    "an _ antichain _ is a set of unrelated elements and corresponds , in an embedding , to a set of spacelike events .",
    "thus , a natural analog of a mots is an _ inextendible antichain _",
    ", i.e.  an antichain such that any element not in it is related to it .",
    "how good is this analogy ? given a faithful embedding @xmath13 , if @xmath14 is an inextendible antichain in @xmath0 , there exist an uncountable infinity of motss which contain @xmath15 . to",
    "what degree do they differ ?",
    "let @xmath16 be two such motss .",
    "consider any pair of points @xmath17 on @xmath16 for which the spacetime interval @xmath18 is non - empty ( where @xmath19 represents the chronological future / past of @xmath20 ) .",
    "since @xmath15 is inextendible any such interval does not intersect @xmath21 .",
    "the probability for this to have happened via a poisson sprinkling is given by @xmath22 $ ] , which is appreciable only for @xmath23 .",
    "thus , with `` high probability '' @xmath15 represents a mots up to @xmath24 differences , i.e. a mots is a good approximation to @xmath14 .",
    "the analogy with a mots is further strengthened by results in @xcite in which we show that the homology of a mots can be recovered from an inextendible antichain which it contains .",
    "however arising from the lorentz invariance of the sprinkled causet , a crucial difference persists . unlike a mots , @xmath15 need not `` capture '' all irreducible causal relations or links , i.e. , if @xmath25 such that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and if there exists no @xmath29 for which @xmath30 .",
    "the existence of such `` missing links '' might lead to observational consequences .",
    "since an antichain is simply a collection of unrelated elements , it is characterized only by its cardinality , which is not enough information to record dimension and topology , much less geometry . we therefore need a richer structure to extract the relevant information contained in a mots from the causal set . indeed , as shown in @xcite , the larger causal set contains geometric and topological information .",
    "one might expect that not all the information in the causal set is required for this purpose , but rather only an appropriately defined subcauset which is a neighbourhood of the inextendible antichain .",
    "such a neighbourhood has a continuum interpretation as a `` thickened '' mots with the scale of thickening corresponding roughly to the resolution of time in physical measurements .",
    "one particularly useful definition of this neighbourhood is a future or past volume thickening of the inextendible antichain , which can be used to recover the homological information of a spatial hypersurface @xcite .",
    "an inextendible antichain @xmath14 is thickened by a volume @xmath31 by adjoining to @xmath14 the set of elements to its future(past ) whose past(future ) up to and including @xmath14 has cardinality less than or equal to @xmath31 .",
    "we define a ( future volume ) _ thickened antichain _ to be @xmath32 so that @xmath33 ( see fig . [ figs ] . )",
    "a past volume thickened antichain is similarly defined .",
    "for both future and past volume thickenings , @xmath34 is _ convex _ in the larger causal set @xmath0 , i.e. if @xmath35 for any @xmath36 , then @xmath37 .",

    "the hartle - hawking wavefunction for a spatial geometry @xmath43 is @xmath44 where the sum is over manifolds @xmath45 with boundary @xmath46 and the path integral is over ( euclidean ) histories @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "this amplitude @xmath49 can not be interpreted as the amplitude for @xmath50 to be a mots , since this requires that all subsequent events be to its causal future ; only _ completed _ spacetime histories contain such subsequent information . to implement this within lorentzian",

    "similarly , the transition amplitude between two spatial slices @xmath55 and @xmath56 , can not be interpreted as a transition amplitude between motss .",
    "one must restrict to the subclass of completed histories @xmath57 such that for any @xmath58 , @xmath59 are non - intersecting motss with @xmath60 to the past of @xmath61 and with the interpolating region between them either to the past or the future , but not both , of any other event in the spacetime .",
    "the transition amplitude between the two motss is then @xmath62}$ ] , with @xmath58 .",
    "this transition amplitude does nt depend merely on the action of the interpolating region but also on the measure of the set of completed histories @xmath57 which contains such a region .",
    "this is a non - local prescription and differs significantly from that in the standard sum - over - histories approach .",
    "although this prescription is natural in the causal set context , it also provides a new framework for covariant sum - over - histories which may be useful in other approaches to quantum gravity . in the remainder of this article",
    "we briefly review the role of observables in causal set ",
    "classical sequential growth \" dynamics in the next section . in section [ proof ]",
    "we show that the existence of thickened antichains , and transitions between them , is measurable .",
    "they are observables . in the final section [ discussion ] we related these measures to more familiar conditional probabilities and reflect on how these ideas might be applied in the context of causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "in the absence of a clear formulation of a quantum causal set dynamics , we turn to the classical stochastic growth ( csg ) models of causets @xcite to flesh out the details of our proposal .",
    "covariant observables in the class of ( extended ) generalised percolation models have been completely characterised @xcite and",
    "the hope is that they will provide an insight into the nature of observables in the quantum theory .",
    "we use the formalism developed in @xcite to show that the causal set analogue of motss and transitions between them can be assigned a covariant meaning in these theories .    in @xcite the set of observables for a class of csg models , called generalised percolation dynamics , was completely characterised in terms of covariant past sets or `` stem sets '' .",
    "these results were recently generalised to the class of extended percolation dynamics @xcite in @xcite .",
    "more specifically , one can express the causal set dynamics in terms of a measure space , which is a triad @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the set of _ completed _ unlabeled causets being the sample space , @xmath65 a @xmath66-algebra on @xmath64 , and @xmath67 the probability measure obtained from the dynamics .",
    "a covariant observable of the theory then corresponds to a measurable physical question , i.e. , an element of @xmath65 .",
    "a subcauset @xmath68 of a causal set is called a _ stem _",
    "if it is its own inclusive past , i.e. , @xmath69 . a _ stem set _ associated with a ( finite ) causet @xmath68 is the set of completed causal sets @xmath0 which contain @xmath68 as stem .",
    "the main result of @xcite was to show that , save sets of measure zero , the set of stem sets generates the @xmath66-algebra @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , since stems are past sets , the physical interpretation of these observables is straightforward .",
    "what we will prove is that thickened antichains and transitions between them admit a covariant , measurable interpretation in terms of stem sets and hence are elements of @xmath65 .",
    "because of the formulation of the dynamics as a sequential growth process , we need to impose the slightly stronger condition of _ past finiteness _ on the causets : @xmath0 is past finite if @xmath70 is finite @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 be the set of finite causets .",
    "a finite causet @xmath73 is a _ future end _ of a finite causet @xmath0 if @xmath73 is a subcauset of @xmath0 such that @xmath73 contains its own future in @xmath0 .",
    "the _ past end _ is defined analogously and is equivalent to a stem .",
    "a future end @xmath73 of @xmath0 is said to be _ maximal _ if for every @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "a maximal past end is similarly defined .",
    "a finite causet @xmath76 is said to _ interpolate _ between the subcausets @xmath14 and @xmath77 if @xmath76 has a maximal past end isomorphic to @xmath14 , and a maximal future end of isomorphic to @xmath77 , both of which are thickened antichains in @xmath76 and are disjoint in @xmath76 .",
    "a causet @xmath0 contains an _ interpolating region _",
    "@xmath76 with maximal ends @xmath78 if @xmath76 is a finite convex subcauset of @xmath0 interpolating between a maximal future and past end isomorphic to @xmath14 and @xmath77 , respectively , which are both thickened antichains in @xmath0 .    in the csg models ,",
    "one grows a causal set stage by stage , starting from a single element .",
    "following the terminology of that paper , a finite causal set @xmath79 is an _ ancestor _ of some @xmath80 if @xmath81 is a stem in @xmath82 .",
    "conversely , @xmath82 is said to be a _ descendant _ of @xmath81 .",
    "one obtains @xmath82 from @xmath81 by adding elements to @xmath81 maximally : starting from @xmath81 , a single maximal element is added to @xmath81 to obtain the causal set @xmath83 , and so on to get @xmath82 .",
    "the new elements are maximal at the stage at which they are added , but do not need to remain maximal at subsequent stages .    for simplicity , we will confine our analysis to thickened antichains of finite cardinality and interpolators between such thickened antichains of fixed finite cardinality .",
    "a finite thickened antichain can be given the continuum interpretation of a `` volume thickened '' mots which has finite spacetime volume .",
    "likewise , fixing the cardinality of the interpolator between a pair of finite thickened antichains corresponds to fixing the volume of the spacetime between two motss , as in the unimodular approach to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "let @xmath84 denote the set of ( past finite ) completed causets containing the finite future or past volume thickening @xmath14 of an inextendible antichain @xmath85 . given a pair of finite causets @xmath86 containing inextendible antichains @xmath85 and @xmath87 respectively , and an @xmath88 , let @xmath89 denote the set of completed causets containing any interpolator @xmath90 with ends @xmath86 as an interpolating region . assuming throughout that @xmath14 , @xmath77 are non - empty , we show that :    0.1 cm * proposition : * _ ( i ) @xmath84 and ( ii ) @xmath89 are elements of the @xmath66-algebra @xmath91 generated by the set of stem sets .",

    "@xmath81 contains a set of isomorphic copies @xmath107 of @xmath14 as maximal future ends , with inextendible antichains @xmath96 , none of which are thickened antichains in @xmath0 . since @xmath108 , the @xmath95 are convex in @xmath0 and the @xmath96 are antichains in @xmath0 .",
    "thus the only option then is that none of the @xmath96 are inextendible antichains in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 contains a finite stem @xmath109 for which this is true , so that @xmath110 .",
    "but since @xmath111 , @xmath112 or @xmath113 . this must be true for all @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "thus , @xmath116 .",
    "since for @xmath117 , @xmath118 , this means that @xmath119 , which is a contradiction .",
    "next , we show that @xmath120 .",

    "@xmath81 is therefore a stem in @xmath0 , so that @xmath122 .",
    "since @xmath14 is a thickened antichain in @xmath0 , there exists no stem @xmath82 in @xmath0 containing @xmath81 for which the @xmath85 in @xmath14 is not an inextendible antichain .",
    "neither can the convexity of @xmath14 be spoiled by any descendant .",
    "thus @xmath123 , and hence @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath1240.1 cm note : the measurability of the set of past finite causets containing a `` post '' , or an element related to every other element in the causet , is a special case , when @xmath14 is a single element antichain .",
    "\\(ii ) the measurability of @xmath125 follows similarly .",
    "there exist a finite set @xmath126 of interpolators @xmath90 with ends @xmath127 .",
    "let @xmath92 be the finite set of causets which contain any @xmath128 as an interpolating region _ and _ as a maximal future end .",
    "for any @xmath93 , let @xmath129 be the ( finite number of ) @xmath76 s @xmath130 contained in @xmath81 as an interpolating region and as a maximal future end , and let the ends of each @xmath131 be @xmath132 , where @xmath133 are isomorphic to @xmath14 and @xmath77 , respectively , with @xmath134 the respective inextendible antichains isomorphic to @xmath135 .",
    "let @xmath97 be the set of descendants of @xmath81 which do not contain any copy of any of the @xmath136 as an interpolating region .",
    "we may then define the set @xmath99 as in ( i ) .",
    "the proof is now logically identical to that of ( i).@xmath124    the proof above can be simply modified to accommodate more generally defined thickened antichains .",
    "for example , a thickened antichain @xmath14 can be defined to be a convex subcauset of @xmath0 which contains _ any _ antichain @xmath137 inextendible in @xmath0 . or",
    ", it could be defined to be convex and `` separating '' in @xmath0 , the latter term meaning that every element of @xmath0 not in @xmath14 is related to an element of @xmath14 .",
    "as is obvious from our construction , the measure of @xmath84 is the probability that the thickened antichain @xmath14 appears _ at least once _ in a causal set .",
    "for example , if the measure of @xmath84 is one , then this means that all completed causets that can occur in the dynamics contain @xmath14 as a thickened antichain , and if it is zero , then none of the causets can contain @xmath14 as a thickened antichain .",
    "similarly , the measure of @xmath89 is the probability that an interpolating region of cardinality @xmath138 with the ends @xmath14 and @xmath77 appears at least once in a causet .",
    "this provides a covariant definition of transitions between discrete analogs of motss . relating the measure @xmath139 on @xmath89 to a transition probability , however , is a more subtle issue since it is the conditional probability for the transition from @xmath14 to @xmath77 _ given _ that @xmath14 occurs .",
    "if we merely divide @xmath139 by the measure @xmath140 on @xmath84 , then this gives us the probability that a causet will contain at least one interpolating region from @xmath14 to @xmath77 , given that @xmath14 occurs .",
    "this differs from the standard interpretation , since it leaves open the possibility that other @xmath14 s in a causet may not transition to @xmath77 with the same probability .",
    "the measure on @xmath84 can be used to determine the measure on spatial topologies in the following sense : spatial topologies corresponding to @xmath14 are precluded if @xmath84 has vanishingly small probability measure .",
    "likewise , the occurrence of transitions from @xmath14 to @xmath77 are precluded if @xmath141 has vanishingly small probability .",
    "restricting to a `` cosmic time '' @xmath142 , which we take to be the cardinality of the inclusive past , is also useful for cosmological predictions , since we can ask what is the probability for @xmath14 to occur at some suitable @xmath142 . on classical scales",
    ", one does nt expect to see topology change @xcite .",
    "hence , if @xmath142 is chosen to be large enough so that topology change can no longer occur , then this would amount to a prediction for the spatial topology of the universe , in the event that our analysis survives quantisation .",
    "we have used the csg model to test our hypothesis that thickened antichains and transitions between them can be given a covariant interpretation in causal set dynamics . moreover , we suggest that the continuum approximation of a thickened antichain is a thickened mots which contains the geometric and topological information of a mots .",
    "this provides us with a new covariant understanding of spatial hypersurfaces and transitions between them .",
    "indeed , if the observability of stem sets survives quantisation , our analysis and interpretation would extend trivially to the quantum picture .",
    "what is new  and may have relevance outside the context of causal sets  is that we have defined a covariant procedure for identifying a sub - region of the universe , independent of a choice of coordinate time .",
    "this notion of a covariant sum - over - histories may be useful in other approaches to quantum gravity in computing transitions over a finite spacetime volume and on completed histories . in cdt , since the histories are sufficiently completed , the probabilities can be obtained by performing a search in the space of causal triangulations for a particular three geometry @xmath14 , or for a triangulated region of volume @xmath143 containing @xmath14 and @xmath77 as initial and final boundaries . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath77 do not necessarily have to be individual geometries , but could be required to be members of sets of geometries which posses some property .",
    "the notion of a thickened antichain also finds a resonance in cdt . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the spectral dimension for spatial hypersurfaces is 1.5 rather than 3 in 4-dimensional spacetimes and that thickening by a single unit gives a value of a little over 2 .",
    "our work on the homology of thickened antichains @xcite suggests that the spatial hypersurface needs to be thickened to a scale much larger than the discreteness scale before it can correctly reproduce continuum topological information , including dimension .",
    "causal sets also make their appearance in the spin foam framework , as causal spin foams ( csf)@xcite .",
    "our prescription suggests a way to obtain a spatial hypersurface in an abstract csf , where again , the thickening roughly corresponds to a time - measurement . to the extent that the csf approach is a sum - over - histories formulation of quantum gravity",
