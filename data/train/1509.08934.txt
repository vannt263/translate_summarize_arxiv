    "+ on the other hand , the value of the dimensionless sfe parameter does not significantly affect the results . models s000 and sc50 have different value of @xmath29 = 0.033 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "the time variation of the sfr and metallicity distribution of sc50 is however similar to that of s000 .",
    "this result suggests that the time variation of the sfr and metallicity distribution are insensitive to the value of @xmath29 if we use a reasonable value of @xmath24 (= 100 @xmath26 ) .",
    "slightly lower metallicity of sc50 than s000 is due to slightly lower sfr of sc50 than s000 .",
    "this result suggests that the value of @xmath29 does not affect the metallicity distribution as well as radial profiles and the sfr .",
    "when we adopt @xmath24 = 100 @xmath26 , it takes much longer local dynamical time to flow from the reservoir ( @xmath141 1 @xmath26 ) to the star - forming regions ( @xmath142 100 @xmath26 ) .",
    "this timescale does not depend on @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "our results are , thus , independent of @xmath29 .",
    "+ these results suggest that the time variation of the sfr and metallicity distribution is significantly affected by the threshold density for star formation and sn feedback energy .",
    "low @xmath24 model ( sn10 ) produces too many emp stars .",
    "in contrast , low @xmath47 model ( se01 ) has too many metal - rich stars .",
    "these differences in metallicity distribution are due to the difference of the time variation of the sfr among models . on the other hand ,",
    "model s000 reproduces observation of metallicity distribution as well as dynamical properties .",
    "parameters of s000 are taken from the observed values .",
    "threshold density of s000 ( @xmath24 = 100 @xmath26 ) is taken from mean density of gmcs .",
    "sn feedback energy of s000 ( @xmath47 = @xmath39 erg ) is taken from the canonical explosion energy of ccsne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we thus treat s000 as a model that has fiducial parameter sets .",
