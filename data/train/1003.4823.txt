    "the possibility that the propagation of light through our universe might suffer from chiral effects , which could rotate the plane of polarization , arises in a variety of important contexts , such as the presence of a cosmological pseudo - scalar condensate , lorentz invariance violation and charge parity and time ( cpt ) violation , neutrino number asymmetry , and the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) violation ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the simplest form for modeling cosmological birefringence - a frequency independent rotation of the plane of linear polarization - is described by the interaction of a pseudo - scalar field @xmath2 with photons through a term @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the coupling constant , @xmath5 is the electromagnetic tensor and @xmath6 its dual .",
    "@xmath2 could be a fundamental field or an effective description for cosmological birefringence due to lorentz violation @xcite .",
    "indeed several efforts have been devoted to look for evidence of rotation of the plane of polarization : since we expect tiny effects on the basis of laboratory experiments , cosmological distances are required to have measurable effects and therefore the obvious approach has been to look for rotation in the most distant sources in the universe . what is required for this test",
    "is then a polarized distant source , for which the polarization orientation can be predicted : the predicted orientation is then compared with the measured one , looking for a rotation between the two .",
    "radio galaxies ( rg ) are very good candidates , since these astrophysical objects are often polarized , both at radio and at uv - optical wavelengths , and are found at very high redshifts @xcite . since the first successful detection of anisotropies in polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by dasi in 2002 @xcite ,",
    "also the cmb polarization pattern has become an important test for cosmological birefringence , which could probe the propagation of light back to the recombination surface , i.e. up to a redshift as high as @xmath7 .",
    "cosmological birefringence was first constrained from rg observations , since these were the first cosmological sources providing information on polarization .",
    "@xcite have used the fact that the distribution of the difference between the position angle ( p.a . ) of the radio axis and the p.a . of the e vector of linear radio polarization in distant rg ( @xmath8 ) peaks around @xmath9 to argue that this phenomenon is intrinsic to the source and therefore to put limits ( @xmath10 at the 95% confidence level ) on the rotation of the plane of polarization for radiation traveling over cosmic distances .",
    "later @xcite used the perpendicularity between the optical / uv axis and the linear optical / uv polarization of distant rg  this perpendicularity is expected since the polarization and the elongation are due to scattering of anisotropic nuclear radiation  to show that the plane of polarization is not rotated by more than @xmath11 for every distant rg with a polarization measurement up to @xmath12 .",
    "the advantage of the test using the optical / uv polarization over that using the radio one is that it is based on a physical prediction of the orientation of the polarization due to scattering , which is lacking in the radio case , and that it does not require a correction for the faraday rotation , which is considerable in the radio but negligible in the optical / uv .    a few years later @xcite claimed to have found a rotation , independent of the faraday one , in the radio polarization of distant rg .",
    "however several authors @xcite have independently and convincingly argued against this claim , and additional unpublished data @xcite on the lack of rotation for the radio polarization of distant rg have been reported @xcite .",
    "as already said , the observed polarization of the cmb has recently been used to put stringent constraints on cosmological birefringence , which would modify the linear polarization pattern created first by thomson scattering and then by reionization , and generate correlations between time and magnetic field and between electric and magnetic fields , otherwise zero in a standard cosmological scenario . by using the constant angle approximation - we denote @xmath13 the rotation angle in the following - for the integrated rotation of the linear polarization plane along the line of sight @xcite , the observed power spectra are proportional to the power spectra on the last scattering surface through trigonometric functions of @xmath13 .",
    "several constraints , summarized in table 1 , have been obtained within this approximation ( see however @xcite for the limits of the constant angle approximation ) .    in this paper",
    "we report on an update of the test using the uv polarization of distant rg , because several new polarization information has become available on very distant rg since this test was last performed @xcite , and discuss its implications in various contexts .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : after this introduction , we describe the set of observations on uv polarization and the constraints on the rotation angle .",
    "we then discuss the implications of this constraints for cosmological birefringence caused by a pseudo - scalar field ( playing the role of dark matter or dark energy ) and by a cherns - simons term respectively in sections 3 and 4 . in section 5",
    "we conclude .",
    "the birefringence test based on the uv polarization of rg is independent , complementary and placed at a different frequency with respect to those based on the radio polarization of distant rg and on the cmb polarization .",
    "the uv polarization test has also some advantages over the other tests .",
    "the main advantage over the test based on the radio polarization is that the uv and the cmb tests are based on a clear prediction of the polarization angle , given by the scattering physics , while a clear prediction is lacking for the radio polarization angle , which is only phenomenologically found to peak at about @xmath9 and @xmath14 from the radio axis , without a clear understanding of the physics behind it @xcite .",
    "distant rg observations provide a snapshot integrated up to a much smaller redshifts ( @xmath15 ) with respect to the cmb one : as it occurs for cmb and sn ia in probing the expansion history , the combination of cmb and rg may be very useful to constrain the cosmological birefringence .",
    "being based at short wavelengths , the uv test is practically immune from faraday rotation by intervening magnetic fields along the line of sight , which instead is relevant for radio and - to a smaller extent - for microwave observations @xcite , reminding however that the faraday rotation can be corrected for , since it depends on frequency , while birefringence does not .",
    "after the first birefringence test based on the uv polarization of distant rg by @xcite , the test has been repeated by other authors . in particular , the rg 3c 265 at z=0.811 is a suitable source , because its misalignment between the radio and optical / uv axes provides a crucial check of the scattering hypothesis @xcite and because its bright extensions allow to build up a good polarization map @xcite , in which the perpendicularity of the polarization vectors can be tested for each of the several tens of independent measurements at different locations . indeed",
    "the spectacular polarization pattern of 3c265 has been used by wardle et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to rule out the birefringence claimed by nodland & ralston ( 1997 ) .",
    "since then , several new polarization measurements for distant rg have become available and an update of the birefringence test has become desirable , in particular using the most distant ones , as a complement of the similar test performed using the cmb polarization .    in order to perform the best test now possible with rg , we have selected all rg with @xmath16 , with the degree of linear polarization @xmath17 larger than 5% in the far uv ( at @xmath18 1300  , rest frame ) , and with elongated optical morphology at these wavelengths , since these are the marking characteristics of the presence of scattered nuclear radiation @xcite , and can therefore lead to a safe test of the polarization rotation @xcite .",
    "the relevant data are collected from the literature in table 2 .",
    "the second - last column of the table lists the difference between the p.a . of the linear uv polarization and the p.a . of the uv axis , which we have measured on the available images in the rest - frame uv , and is shown in figure 1 .",
    "according to the scattering model , these two directions should be perpendicular for every object in our sample .",
    "the fact that the p.a .",
    "difference is close to @xmath9 for every object , actually compatible with @xmath9 within the accuracy of the measurements , puts stringent constraints on any possible rotation @xmath19 of the polarization plane for light traveling to us from each rg , as listed in the last column of the table . assuming that the rotation of the polarization plane should be the same in every direction ( as is done in the cmb case )",
    ", we can set the average constraint @xmath20 , as listed in the last row of the table .",
    "upper limits on the linear polarization rotation angle @xmath19 can be used to constrain cosmological birefringence caused by the coupling of the electromagnetic field to pseudo - scalar fields , suggested to solve the strong charge and parity ( cp ) problem @xcite .",
    "the existence of light pseudo - scalar particles @xcite is very relevant in cosmology , since these are viable candidate either for dark matter @xcite or for dark energy @xcite , depending on their ( effective ) mass .",
    "a pseudo - scalar field @xmath2 is predicted to be coupled to photons as can be read from the lagrangian of the electromagnetic-@xmath2 sector : = -f_f^-_^- v ( ) -f_^ [ total ] where @xmath21 is the potential for the pseudo - scalar field . at the lowest order in fluctuations ,",
    "the photon is coupled to the time derivative of the cosmological value of @xmath2 , which is governed by the potential .",
    "different time evolutions of @xmath2 lead to different values for the resulting cosmological birefringence , and therefore in the following two subsections we consider representative cosmological scenarios involving totally different values for the time variation of @xmath2 . and in many cases the constant angle approximation is a poor description of cosmological birefringence in cmb anisotropies @xcite . ]",
    "we consider as potential in equation ( [ total ] ) : v()=m^2 f_a^2 ( 1- ) [ potential_dm ] where @xmath22 is the mass and @xmath23 is the energy scale at which the peccei - quinn symmetry is broken . in the dark matter regime the pseudo - scalar field oscillates near the minimum of the potential , therefore @xmath24 .",

    "an ultralight pseudo nambu - goldstone boson could drive an accelerated expansion of the universe , as proposed by @xcite , by considering a simple shift of the potential in equation ( [ potential_dm ] ) : v ( ) = m^4 [ potential_de ] with @xmath41 and @xmath42 mass and energy scale for the dark energy case , respectively ( note that these numbers and @xmath4 may be quite different from the dark matter case ) .",
    "when @xmath2 acts as dark energy , it is presently rolling toward the bottom of the potential ( located at @xmath43 ) with small velocity : in the future , @xmath2 will roll around the bottom of the potential and will be another matter component added to cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the linear polarization angle @xmath19 is related to the variation of @xmath44 : [ theta : de ] ( ) = . and the evolution of @xmath2 is determined solving the following system of equations : \\ {",

    "figure  [ plot::thetapngb2b ] shows the variation of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath52 . in the region probed by high - redshift rg ( @xmath36 ) there is a variation of the pseudo - scalar field the order @xmath53 .",
    "therefore equation  ( [ theta : de ] ) can be used to obtain an upper limit on @xmath4 : @xmath54    let us also consider a runaway potential like : v ( ) = v_0 ( - ) . [ expotential_de ] the above potential has only @xmath55 as physical scale , differently from the one in equation ( 8) .",
    "the resulting dark energy model is stable for @xmath56 and has an equation of state @xmath57 , with @xmath58 , constant in time @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor in this cosmological model can therefore be found analytically @xcite , as also the evolution of the scalar field .",

    "the angle by which the plane of polarization rotates is half of the difference phase , since @xmath71 is expected to be small , therefore the dispersion relation can be expanded at first order in @xmath71 : k= ( p_0-p ) . for a wave traveling a distance @xmath72 the linear polarization vector",

    "every single existing measurement of the uv linear polarization in rg at @xmath0 , due to scattering of anisotropic nuclear radiation , excludes that the polarization plane rotates by more than a few degrees while the light travels from the source to us for more than 3/4 of the universe lifetime , confirming previous results at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "the all - sky - average constraint derived on the rotation of the polarization from the set of observations considered in this paper ( @xmath20 ) is independent , but consistent with the constraints derived from cmb observations .",
    "we have studied the implications of this constraint on physical models of cosmological birefringence , showing how observations at high redshifts as those of rg are complementary to cmb anisotropies , as already occurs for sn ia and cmb in measuring the expansion history . in the framework of theoretical models associating the cosmological birefringence with the variation of the newton constant our results",
    "increase our confidence in the validity of the eep , on which all metric theories of gravity are based .",
    "an improvement in both quantity and quality of the measurements of the uv linear polarization in rg at high redshift should be possible in the future with the coming generation of giant optical telescopes @xcite , and would narrow the constraint on @xmath19 to a level smaller than what is now possible with rg and cmb .",
