    "following the recombination of the universe and the release of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the vast majority of baryonic matter in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) consisted of neutral atoms , in stark contrast to the highly ionized igm seen a few billion years later @xcite and at the present day @xcite .",

    ", we hope to understand the nature of the faintest and earliest collapsed structures .",
    "the cmb itself provides an  integral \" constraint on the total column density of ionized gas through the measured optical depth to electron scattering @xmath11 , and thus a characteristic reionization redshift @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , a wide range of models for the reionization history are consistent with cmb measurements @xcite , and @xmath11 alone does not constrain the topology of the inhomogeneous reionization process @xcite .",
    "an important boundary condition to the epoch of reionization is the ubiquitous transmission through the ly@xmath0 forest at @xmath13 which is inconsistent with a predominantly neutral igm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "large stretches of neutral gas are still possible at higher redshift @xmath5 where the ly@xmath0 forest is almost entirely opaque .    the @xmath14 ly@xmath0 forest has been studied for well over a decade to constrain the evolution of the ionization state of the universe close to the reionization epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "eventually , the only transmission seen in the ly@xmath0 forest is in narrow transmission spikes , likely corresponding to small - scale regions of the universe with particularly low density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the large - scale transmission measurements then simply reflect the number and strength of these spikes that fall into wide bins in each spectrum , where the size is defined either in terms of redshift interval ( @xmath16 ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or by comoving distance ( 50 mpc@xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",

    ", some large - scale regions with formal limits on their _ mean _ transmission contain high significance transmission spikes @xcite , which results in mean transmission below the significance threshold ( @xmath18 ) when combined with surrounding gp troughs . clearly , there is information in these small - scale transmission features which is lost when averaging on large scales , suggesting a  matched filtering \" approach targeting transmission spikes would be more sensitive .",
    "another limiting factor for determining the ionization state of the @xmath5 universe is that the ly@xmath0 forest becomes essentially completely saturated , even at small scales , with many lines of sight consistent with zero transmission .",

    "* ) and its statistics can be modeled with standard simulations of the igm that employ a uniform ionizing background .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : tauevol ] shows similar curves to the panel above it , but computed for the ly@xmath4 forest including the presence of foreground ly@xmath0 , demonstrating that observable ly@xmath4 transmission should persist to substantially higher redshift than ly@xmath0 at fixed observational cost .",
    "the most striking example of the increased sensitivity provided by ly@xmath4 is the @xmath32 mpc@xmath3 gp trough observed in the @xmath33 quasar ulas j0148 + 0600 with an effective optical depth @xmath34 ( @xmath18 limit ) in the ly@xmath0 forest , but which shows many prominent transmission spikes in the ly@xmath4 forest ( see figure 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of ly@xmath4 transmission proves the existence of a highly - ionized igm in this region despite the complete saturation of ly@xmath0 , consistent with theoretical predictions for large - scale fluctuations in the ionizing background after the end of reionization @xcite or relic temperature fluctuations due to inhomogeneous heating during reionization ( @xcite ; davies et al . , in prep . ) .    in this work ,",

    "we use outputs of the density , temperature , and velocity fields at @xmath44 and @xmath45 to model the @xmath14 ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forest and the @xmath30 ly@xmath0 contamination of the @xmath14 ly@xmath4 forest , respectively .",

    "we re - scale the physical gas density along each skewer by @xmath46 to account for cosmological expansion , making the simplifying assumption that within the redshifts of interest the evolution of the overdensity field is less important .",
    "our simulation meets the suggested mass resolution requirement to resolve the @xmath47 ly@xmath0 forest proposed by @xcite ( @xmath48 m@xmath49 ) , although convergence may be different for a grid code like nyx versus the smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations they studied .",
    "convergence may also be more difficult for the extremely low transmission of the @xmath5 ly@xmath0 forest , suggested by the lack of convergence between the co - spatial ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 optical depths at @xmath14 of relatively high - resolution simulations shown in the appendix of @xcite . in future work",
    "we will quantify the convergence ( or lack thereof ) of the @xmath5 igm in our simulation , extending the tests in @xcite which were limited to @xmath50 , but preliminary tests suggest that the mean ly@xmath0 transmission is converged to better than @xmath51 ( j. oorbe , private communication ) .",

    "we defer the interested reader to df16 for the details , but we briefly summarize the method here .",

    "the ionizing background from these galaxies is computed on a coarse 80@xmath43 grid allowing the mean free path of ionizing photons to vary spatially depending on the large - scale density field and local ionizing background , @xmath59 , with the average mean free path in the volume normalized to @xmath60 mpc . in figure  [ fig : uvb ] we show a slice through the ionizing background model , which exhibits strong large - scale fluctuations consistent with what is required to reproduce the distribution of gunn - peterson troughs in the @xmath36 ly@xmath0 forest ( df16 ) .",
    "we simulate the ionizing background in a separate volume from the hydrodynamical simulation because the latter is not large enough to fully model the effect of the fluctuating mean free path of ionizing photons , and thus would have much weaker ionizing background fluctuations on the @xmath61 mpc scales we investigate in this work ( df16 ) .",
    "because of this , we are explicitly ignoring the anti - correlation of the density and radiation fields on very large scales shown by df16 . in this work",
    "we assume that this large - scale anti - correlation does not strongly affect the statistics of small - scale transmission features in the igm , an assumption we will test in future work .    in the top and middle panels of figure  [ fig : mockspec ] , we show ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forest segments of a mock spectrum from @xmath62@xmath63 .",

    "fig : pdfs ] we show the transmission probability distribution function ( pdf ) on 2 mpc scales ( d@xmath67 ) of the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forests from simulations of @xmath14 spectra with varying uniform @xmath22 of @xmath68 s@xmath20 ( top , blue ) , @xmath69 s@xmath20 ( middle , black ) , and @xmath70 s@xmath20 ( bottom , orange ) .",
    "these @xmath22 values roughly correspond to the mean and + /-",
    "1@xmath71 uncertainty range of current measurements from the ly@xmath0 forest at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the pdfs are characterized by a gaussian peak around zero  corresponding to the noise floor , shown as the dotted line in every panel  and a tail towards higher transmission whose steepness is a function of ionizing background strength .",
    "the shape of the pdf is markedly different from the distributions seen at @xmath72@xmath73 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because the @xmath5 ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forests are so opaque that they almost never come close to the continuum ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". in the bottom panels the red curve corresponds to a model with the same average @xmath74 s@xmath20 that includes fluctuations in the ionizing background ( as shown in figures  [ fig : uvb ] and [ fig : mockspec ] ) . in general the effect of background fluctuations on the 2 mpc - binned transmission pdf is minor , although it does lead to an extended tail of rare transmission spikes .",
    "the effect is larger on the ly@xmath0 pdf than the ly@xmath4 pdf due to the contamination of ly@xmath4 by foreground @xmath30 ly@xmath0 forest absorption , i.e. , even if @xmath22 fluctuates high , the transmission spikes can only increase up to the absorption level of the @xmath30 ly@xmath0 forest (   [ sec : sims ] ) .    in the right set of panels in figure  [ fig : pdfs ]",
    "we show the pdfs on 20 mpc scales .",
    "this is analogous to previous studies of large bins in the ly@xmath0 forest @xcite but at a scale smaller by around a factor of three .",
    "the distributions are narrower ( note the difference in transmission scale on the horizontal axis ) , reflecting not only a decrease in sky noise ( s / n@xmath75 ) , but also the tendency for several transmission spikes to fall into a single bin leading to a somewhat more gaussian shape to the distribution ( as per the central limit theorem ) . for moderate ionization rates @xmath76 s@xmath20 , the model pdfs suggest that high signal - to - noise transmission should nearly always be measured in the ly@xmath4 forest at this scale .",
    "the effect of ionizing background fluctuations on the pdfs is considerably stronger on large scales , consistent with the @xmath77s of mpc typical scales of background fluctuations seen in the simulations ( e.g. figure  [ fig : mockspec ] ) .",
    "in particular the large - scale ly@xmath4 pdf is strongly affected by ionizing background fluctuations through an excess in 20 mpc - scale ly@xmath4 -dark regions ( gp troughs ) over the uniform background model , which are otherwise consistent with the noise floor in the ly@xmath0 forest , suggesting that it may have considerable constraining power for the parameters of models for strong fluctuations in igm opacity ( e.g. df16 , @xcite ) .",
    "the 20 mpc - scale pdfs shown here are analogous to the 50 mpc@xmath3-scale ( cumulative ) pdfs studied by @xcite  they similarly allow one to characterize fluctuations in the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forests on the large - scales expected from an inhomogeneous reionization process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from these pdfs we should be able to assess the probability for any given model to reproduce rare transmission spikes in the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forests , and from their detailed shape , study the patchy nature of the post - reionization igm .",
    "in practice , performing parameter inference from the pdfs is difficult because much of their constraining power lies in a handful of transmission spikes in the tail of the distribution , and the features in the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forests should be correlated because they trace the same physical structures .",
    "the standard approach to igm parameter inference from the transmission pdf of the ly@xmath0 forest at @xmath72@xmath73 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is to choose a set of coarse bins in the range of @xmath78 , compute the covariance matrix of the bins from either jackknife sampling of real data @xcite or forward - modeling of the ly@xmath0 forest in hydrodynamical simulations @xcite , and then approximate the likelihood function as a multivariate gaussian .",
    "because each pdf bin typically contains thousands of pixels , the central limit theorem ensures that a multivariate gaussian likelihood is a good approximation .",
    "the situation changes dramatically at higher redshifts where the igm is more opaque and fewer quasars are available . at @xmath5 , most pixels in the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forests are consistent with zero transmission , with only a _",
    "sparse _ tail of real transmission spikes . while the ( co)variances of each bin can be estimated by forward modeling of mock spectra ,",
    "the resulting gaussian distributions ( as defined by the mean and ( co)variance of the mock samples ) are not representative of the distributions of the number of pixels that fall into each bin .",
    "we show an example of this in figure  [ fig : nongauss ] , where the bottom panel illustrates the true and gaussian - approximated distributions of mock ly@xmath4 pdf measurements in transmission bins highlighted in the top panel , with one mock observation shown .",
    "the requirement of approximately gaussian likelihood is more stringent for transmission measurements on larger bin scales , such as the @xmath79 mpc@xmath3 measurements by @xcite , where the small number of measurements  and the tendency for measurements to be reported as limits  have typically led to rough  chi - by - eye \" comparisons to simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to circumvent these challenges , we adopt the statistical approach known as abc ( e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite for other astronomical applications ) which allows for parameter inference without any explicit analytic form for the likelihood function .",
    "we start with an abridged statement of bayes theorem , @xmath80 where @xmath81 represents the set of model parameters ( e.g. @xmath22 ) and @xmath82 represents the data ( e.g. the transmission measured in each spectral pixel ) , @xmath83 is the likelihood function , @xmath84 is the prior distribution representing our previous knowledge of the model parameters , and @xmath85 is the posterior distribution for @xmath81 that we hope to obtain . in many cases ,",
    "the likelihood function can be approximated as a multivariate gaussian distribution or can be straightforwardly computed numerically , allowing the posterior distribution to be computed through methods such as markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) . in our case , as we have shown above , such an approximation fails to adequately describe the distribution of mock measurements in our models .",
    "one could imagine a brute force computation of the likelihood function by computing mock data sets to determine the probability of exactly reproducing the data , but this is computationally intractable for many problems .",
    "the first and most fundamental approximation proposed by abc is to slightly blur the definition of the likelihood function , instead describing the posterior distribution as ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a forward - modeled mock data set , @xmath88 represents a distance measure between the data and mock data , @xmath89 is a small tolerance threshold , and the integral is performed over the space of forward - modeled mock datasets .",
    "that is , to approximate the likelihood function , abc proposes that coming _ close _ to the measured data is  good enough , \" allowing for far easier computation than the brute force method mentioned above . in the process",
    ", the correlations between data elements are naturally accounted for through the forward - modeling procedure without any explicit computation of the covariance matrix .",
    "the simplest application of abc in practice is to draw model parameter samples @xmath90 from the prior , forward model a mock realization of the data given by those parameters @xmath91 , then measure the distance between the mock data and real data @xmath92 .",
    "if this distance is  small enough \" , i.e. @xmath93 , then @xmath90 is accepted as a sample of the posterior distribution . this procedure is called abc rejection sampling",
    ".    the above methodology may still be computationally intractable if the data represent a highly stochastic process or high - dimensional data set .",
    "for example , in our case , producing a mock data set that nearly matches an observed ly@xmath0 and/or ly@xmath4 forest spectrum at the pixel - to - pixel level ( i.e. with small @xmath88 ) requires nearly matching the peak heights and positions of every narrow transmission feature . in practice",
    "this would require matching not only the ionization state of the gas , but also the _ entire set of cosmological initial conditions _ that led to the structures observed along the sightline . to overcome this computational hurdle ,",
    "the technique commonly employed in abc is to use",
    " summary statistics \" to process the data ( and mock data ) into a form which allows them to be compared more easily , typically into a lower - dimensional state . this reformulation can be stated as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the summary statistic of the data and @xmath96 is the summary statistic of mock data set @xmath87 . if the summary statistic is  sufficient",
    "\" then no information is lost , but such summary statistics are only known analytically in very simple cases ( e.g. , for determining the mean of a normally - distributed quantity , the sample mean is a sufficient statistic ) .",
    "thus , in most cases , the use of a summary statistic implies loss of information , leading to bias and/or loss of precision in the posterior distribution . in   [ sec : inftest ] , we perform inference tests on multiple summary statistics of the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forests to investigate their potential biases .    while abc may seem like a  silver bullet \" to perform parameter inference with the least number of assumptions about the nature of the likelihood function , its primary weakness is the requirement of simulating an overwhelmingly large number of mock data sets in order to produce a reasonably converged approximation to the posterior pdf .",
    "even with a one - dimensional summary statistic one may have to generate",
    "_ millions _ of mock data sets , limiting its potential application for practical reasons .",
    "nevertheless , abc allows for inference involving complicated likelihood functions , fully accounting for covariance ( depending on the sufficiency of the chosen summary statistic ) _ implicitly _ as they manifest in the assumed model for mock data .",
    "application of abc to inference of the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forests is performed as follows :    1 .",
    "draw a value of @xmath22 from prior distribution , @xmath97 .",
    "2 .   compute mock spectrum of ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forest with @xmath98 , including noise consistent with observations .",
    "compute summary statistic of mock and observed spectra ( @xmath96 and @xmath95 , respectively ) .",
    "4 .   compute distance between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath99 is below the threshold @xmath89 , keep @xmath97 as a sample of the _ approximate _ posterior pdf , @xmath100 .",
    "repeat steps 15 until a predetermined number of posterior pdf samples have been drawn , e.g. 1000 .    in practice",
    ", the @xmath97 can be drawn more efficiently , and in later sections we adopt a method based on importance sampling with an iteratively declining threshold @xmath89 set based on percentiles of the distribution of @xmath99 ( @xcite ; see detailed implementations by e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these procedures are simply methods to increase the efficiency of the basic rejection sampling method , and as such we will not discuss them in further detail .    for a given segment of the ly@xmath0 or ly@xmath4 forest ,",
    "perhaps the most basic summary statistic is the mean transmission : @xmath101 .",
    "the use of this statistic reduces the dimensionality of the data from [ @xmath102 of ly@xmath0 forest pixels + @xmath102 of ly@xmath4 forest pixels ] to 2 : the mean transmission in ly@xmath0 and the mean transmission in ly@xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath103 . using abc",
    ", we do not have to make any assumptions about the nature of the intrinsic distributions of ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 mean transmission , nor the details of their correlations .",

    "is decreased , the abc posterior distribution narrows , representing successive improvements to the approximated likelihood as it converges to the true distribution . through the abc process , this posterior distribution explicitly includes cosmic variance ( as modeled by the cosmological simulation ) , measurement uncertainty , and the correlation between the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forest mean transmissions .",
    "however , the mean transmissions in the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath4 forests clearly do not tell the entire story .",
    "due to sky noise , a large region of forest may have a mean transmission consistent with zero but still contain a significant positive spike ( e.g. figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of any ( real ) transmission spike requires an ionizing background greater than zero , but the mean transmission alone may not contain this information because of limited signal - to - noise . a summary statistic which retains this information but disregards the locations of transmission spikes is the _ rank - order distribution _ of transmission on small scales .",
