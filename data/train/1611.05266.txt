    "one - dimensional systems of interacting particles or spins show interesting collective effects when the system approaches an ordered state as the temperature approaches zero @xcite .",
    "the static properties of such systems are dominated by a diverging correlation length , and generally well understood",
    ". however , dynamic properties are more varied and intricate .",
    "of particular interest is the way in which domains of ordered phases grow when the system is quenched from a disordered state to an ordered one .",
    "the coarsening dynamics that ensues can often be modelled through the kinetics of domain walls ; a well - known example is the glauber - ising chain , in which domain walls diffuse and annihilate upon contact , corresponding to the kinetics of the reaction @xmath11 0 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a system of arrowheads on a continuous 1d line , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : arrow_heads ] .",
    "arrowheads resemble bent core or banana - shaped molecules , assemblies of which are known to form ordered phases in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "our objective in studying the simpler one - dimensional problem is to understand , qualitatively and quantitatively , the elements that go into the formation of large stacks of similarly oriented arrowheads .",
    "these elements turn out to derive from a set of interlinked themes : entropy - driven ordering ; spin models with assymetric pairwise interaction ; domain wall kinetics with alternating diffusing and stationary walls ( @xmath12 ) . as summarized in the discussion below",
    ", this sequence leads to novel effects in dynamics , both for a finite number of walls , as well as for a finite wall density in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "each zero - area arrowhead points right (  @xmath13  ) or left (  @xmath14  ) , and stochastically attempts to change its location ( via diffusion ) or orientation ( by flipping ) , respecting a no - overlap constraint all the while , as discussed in section ii . since only hard - core interactions operate ( tantamount to the no - overlap constraint ) it is evident that purely entropic effects must be responsible for driving the order . in equilibrium",
    ", this is brought out explicitly by tracing over locations of arrowheads , thereby generating an effective interaction between successive arrowheads , involving their orientations ( section iii ) .",
    "this technique has successfully been used in the past to study 1d assemblies of interacting particles @xcite . in our case ,",
    "interestingly , this interaction is not symmetric under the interchange of the orientations of a near neighbour pair .",
    "a transfer matrix calculation then allows the equation of state and correlation functions to be calculated .",
    "our model is closely related to the ` chiral ' ising models of @xcite , as discussed in more detail in section ii .",
    "when the degree of alignment is large , there are long stretches of aligned arrowheads , with successive stretches being separated by domain walls .",
    "a significant outcome of the non - symmetric interactions is that there are two species of domain walls . in the case of primary interest to us , one species ( @xmath1 ) diffuses , while the other ( @xmath2 ) is immobile , with reaction kinetics @xmath12 .",
    "this has a crucial bearing on the dynamics .",
    "this is already evident with a finite number of walkers ; as shown analytically in section iv , the full survival probability decays exponentially in time , in strong contrast to the power law decays that characterize @xmath4 @xcite , pertinent to relaxation in the glauber - ising model .",
    "moreover , with a thermodynamically large number of walkers , numerical simulations reveal interesting effects ( section v ) .",
    "further , during the approach to steady state ( section vi ) , the density of domain walls falls as @xmath15 as in the ising case .",
    "persistence properties show greater variation .",
    "the persistent fraction of arrowheads is found to decay as a power law @xmath16 , with @xmath8 close to @xmath9 , in contrast to the exact value @xmath17 for the ising case @xcite .",
    "the global persistence decays with the same power @xmath9 , a result which can be justified through theoretical arguments , as in the ising case @xcite .    finally ,",
    "on allowing the @xmath2 walls to diffuse , albeit less slowly than the @xmath1 s ( section vii ) , a degree of nonuniversality is revealed : the exponent @xmath8 is found to depend continuously on the ratio of diffusion constants , even though the fraction of domain walls continues to decay as @xmath15 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the results of @xcite , where a continuous variation of exponents was found as a function of coupling constants , though in different quantities .",
    "our model consists of @xmath18 arrowheads , each of length @xmath19 on a 1d line of length @xmath20 , with a hard core constraint which implies no overlap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : arrow_heads ] ) .",
    "while @xmath20 is taken to be of fixed value with periodic boundary conditions while discussing dynamics , it proves expedient to allow @xmath20 to fluctuate in a constant pressure ensemble in order to derive static properties ; in that case , the number density @xmath21 and other thermodynamic quantities are well - defined in the thermodynamic limit .    a microscopic configuration @xmath22 is specified by the set @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the coordinate of the vertex of the @xmath25 arrowhead while @xmath26 represents the orientation , with the positive sign corresponding to @xmath13 and the negative sign to @xmath14 .",
    "the full dynamics involves attempts to make either a spin flip or displacement of a randomly chosen arrowhead @xmath27 , as follows + ( i ) it can attempt to flip about its vertex @xmath28 + ( ii ) it can attempt a displacement @xmath29 where @xmath29 is chosen with uniform probability in the interval @xmath30 $ ] where @xmath31 is a fixed length . + the attempted moves in ( i ) and ( ii ) are accepted only if they do not lead to an overlap with other arrowheads , and do not lead to crossing arrowheads in case ( ii ) . as discussed in section iii , these moves respect detailed balance and hence lead the system to an equilibrium state .",
    "this state is characterized by a correlation length which diverges as @xmath32 , approaching an ordered state with like orientations ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) .",
    "since both arrowhead flip and displacement attempts are involved in the dynamics , the time - dependent properties of the system would be expected to depend on parameters which govern these , both for autocorrelation functions in steady state , and for the dynamics of approach to steady state .",
    "our preliminary numerical studies indeed indicate that at finite densities @xmath35 , the dynamic power laws do depend on the displacement range @xmath31 . in this paper , however , we are primarily interested in the approach to the fully ordered state which is reached only in the limit @xmath32 . accordingly , we will retain only the re - orientation move ( i ) ; the displacement move ( ii ) is ineffective in this limit .",
    "hence the allowed dynamical moves for the central member in triplet of successive arrowheads are : @xmath36 note that the triplets @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 can not evolve in the limit considered , owing to the no - overlap constraint .",
    "these rules have an important implication for interfaces which separate ordered segments of similarly - oriented arrowheads . evidently , the interfaces are of two types : ( @xmath1 ) ... @xmath41 .... and ( @xmath2 ) .... @xmath42 ... . while @xmath1 interfaces can evolve ( and move in the process ) , @xmath2 interfaces are static .",
    "this distinction is ultimately responsible for the difference of behaviour in the coarsening dynamics vis a vis the glauber - ising model , where both types of interface evolve and diffuse at equal rates . in order to investigate the effects of allowing @xmath2 interfaces to diffuse , though more slowly than @xmath1 interfaces , in section vi we allow configurations @xmath39 and @xmath40 to evolve @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "evidently , by varying the ratio @xmath45 between 0 and 1 , we generate a family of models which interpolates between arrowhead model and the ising model .",
    "the dynamical evolution rules are closely related to those considered by kim et al @xcite .",
    "these authors studied nonequilibrium ising models with dynamics which they termed ` chiral ' , namely with different transition rates at ( @xmath46 ) and ( @xmath47 ) kinks .",
    "besides nonconserving single spin flips ( analogous to arrowhead reorientations ) , they allowed asep - like moves which conserve spin ; these have an important effect on the dynamics , as discussed in subsequent sections .",
    "in this section , we consider the equilibrium properties of the arrowhead model introduced in section ii and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arrow_heads ] .",
    "evidently the hard - core constraint between arrowheads plays a crucial role in determining the set of allowed microscopic configurations , i.e. the possible arrowhead vertex coordinates and `` spin '' orientations \\{@xmath48 } which specify each allowed configuration @xmath22 .",
    "we first observe that the condition of detailed balance @xmath49 is valid provided prob(@xmath22 ) is chosen to be equal for every allowed configuration @xmath22 .",
    "this is because an allowed arrowhead flip @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 occurs at the same rate as the reverse move , and this is true also of every displacement move @xmath24 @xmath51 @xmath24 + @xmath31 which leads to an allowed configuration , and its reverse . since every allowed configuration has equal energy , correlations between arrowheads develop purely from entropy .",
    "it is well known that in systems with hard core interactions , entropy can lead to a tendency towards ordering @xcite .",
    "indeed , as we will see below , this tendency is present in our system as well , and leads ultimately to a diverging correlation length with increasing arrowhead density .    as for several 1d systems with hard objects on a line @xcite",
    ", our system of arrowheads can be solved exactly by integrating over the coordinates \\{@xmath24 } , thereby generating an effective interaction between nearest neighbour spins .",
    "the important point in our case is that this interaction is not symmetric under the interchange of spins in a near neighbour pair of ising spins . as discussed in section ii",
    ", our model is closely related to the chiral ising models discussed in @xcite which have a similar asymmetry ( though no handedness distinction ) .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the resulting spin system can be obtained using a transfer matrix technique , resulting in closed form expressions for the equation of state and correlation functions .",
    "we also study the extent of spatial persistence in this system .",
    "it is convenient to embody the hard - core constraint between arrowheads by introducing an orientation - dependent potential energy of interaction    @xmath53    we work in a constant pressure ensemble , where the pressure @xmath54 and temperature @xmath55 are specified .",
    "the coordinate @xmath56 of the first particle is held fixed ( though @xmath57 can flip ) , while all other @xmath24 can fluctuate , implying that the total length of the system @xmath58 can fluctuate as well .",
    "the corresponding partition function is then    @xmath59      \\end{split}\\ ] ]    for a specified set of spin orientations @xmath50 it is straightforward to perform the integrals over @xmath24 sequentially over @xmath27 with the result    @xmath60    where @xmath61 ; @xmath62 . in terms of the transfer operator @xmath63 with matrix elements @xmath64 ,",
    "we may write    @xmath65    which may readily be evaluated by diagonalizing @xmath66 .",
    "let us define @xmath67 .",
    "then the eigenvalues @xmath68 are given by ( @xmath69 ) , with corresponding right eigenvectors @xmath70 and left eigenvectors @xmath71 .",

    "we find    @xmath75\\ ] ]    in the limit of large @xmath18 , we obtain    @xmath76    recalling that the average system length @xmath77 = @xmath78 we may find the number density @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 and @xmath54 , yielding the equation of state    @xmath81    the contribution to the equation of state coming from the arrowhead configurations is embodied in the second term on the right hand side .",
    "this term is a correction to the ideal gas contribution @xmath82 ; it arises from the hard core interaction between arrowheads .",
    "interestingly , it is small at both high and low values of @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath83 is small , arrowheads are well separated and their orientation is unimportant , so that they approximate a free ideal gas . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath83 is large , the large entropic cost of the pair sequence ( @xmath47 ) makes its occurrence exponentially unlikely .",
    "the vertex locations of the remaining sequences of arrowheads are isomorphic to those of an ideal gas of point particles . the rare occurrence of ( @xmath47 )",
    ", implies that ( @xmath46 ) is equally rare , as these pair sequences must alternate .",
    "together , this implies that the system correlation length must become very large as @xmath84 .",
    "this is verified by direct calculation as discussed below .",
    "the two - point correlation function can be evaluated using the transfer matrix formalism . with free boundary conditions , we have    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the @xmath87 pauli matrix .",
    "@xmath88 can be evaluated through a standard route .",
    "assuming that @xmath27 and @xmath89 are both of order @xmath18 , we obtain @xmath90 = @xmath91 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath92 @xmath93 .",
    "thus the correlation length @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 .",
    "in the dense packing limit @xmath96 , we obtain @xmath97 .",
    "it is also interesting to ask for the spatial persistence , namely the probability that the same value of the spin , say @xmath98 , occurs unbroken over a stretch of @xmath99 sites @xcite . in terms of the projection operator",
    "@xmath100 = @xmath101 with eigenvalues @xmath100=0 or 1 this probability is given by @xmath102 = @xmath103 where the thermodynamic limit @xmath104 has been assumed .",
    "given the form of the operator @xmath105 , the matrix element on the right hand side is found to be @xmath106 , independent of @xmath99 .",
    "thus @xmath107 decays exponentially , as @xmath108 where @xmath109 $ ] . in the dense packing limit @xmath96",
    ", we obtain @xmath110 .",
    "thus in the limit of high density , both the correlation length @xmath94 and the persistence length @xmath111 diverge in similar ways , with prefactors differing by a factor 2 . recall that these ` lengths ' pertain to spin separations which correspond to arrowhead labels ,",
    "so they need to be divided by the density in order to convert them to lengths on the line .",
    "finally we investigate the effect of interaction asymmetry on the spatial separation of arrowheads .",
    "suppose the orientations of the @xmath25 and @xmath112 arrowheads have been specified to be @xmath52 and @xmath113 , and their mean separation is @xmath114 . for a given sequence @xmath115 of intermediate spins , @xmath116 is the sum of separations of successive pairs @xmath117 .",
    "from eq.([eq : potential ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath118 while @xmath119 .",
    "thus    @xmath120    here @xmath121 is the mean number of ( @xmath47 ) pairs in the stretch ( @xmath122 ) ; it can be calculated using the transfer matrix within the finite stretch , keeping track of each occurrence of ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the result is    @xmath123    the mean numbers of @xmath14 @xmath13 pairs differ by exactly 1 for the two specifications of @xmath124 , implying that @xmath125 exceeds @xmath126 by @xmath127 .",
    "this is a quantitative measure of the effects of asymmetry in the interaction .",
    "in the one - dimensional model being considered any possible configuration is a sequence of domains each with all arrows in one direction (  @xmath14 or @xmath13  ) bounded by domain walls @xmath13@xmath14 or @xmath14 @xmath13 .",
    "the dynamic moves are flips of arrows about their vertex with no overlap allowed between arrowheads .",
    "allowed arrowhead flips like @xmath13@xmath13@xmath14 going to @xmath13@xmath14@xmath14 can generate hopping of the domain walls @xmath13 @xmath14 ( hereafter called `` walkers '' or mobile @xmath1 - particles in this section ) . here",
    "we take the limit @xmath35 @xmath51 @xmath93 ( corresponding to @xmath84 in the spin model ) which makes any ( isolated ) one of the other type ( `` walls '' or @xmath2 - particles ) immobile .",

    "the no - overlap constraint prevents the annihilation of pairs of like particles .",
    "furthermore , the two types of domain wall / particle , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , alternate , and continue to do so even after any allowed pair annihilation .",
    "but the surviving @xmath2 s are fixed .",
    "it will be seen that the general system dynamics is qualitatively different from that of @xmath130 .    in this section",
    "we investigate the survival probability for the general case of @xmath131 `` walls '' with @xmath128 intervening `` walkers '' .",

    "effects of an added fixed reflecting or absorbing wall , shown by the vertical straight line , can be represented by an image walker , the open circle , together with its path , a reflection ( in the wall ) of the original path .",
    "this scheme is appropriate for walls of the type @xmath139 in the system being studied , which pair annihilate with the walker . for a single random walker with no wall",

    "it can be verified that the image procedure used above to treat the case @xmath157 again closes for this case of general @xmath128 .",

    "each such system is just like that for the single - walker - between - two  walls case just discussed , and in particular is periodic with the same periodicity .",
    "so , up to the time of the first walker annihilation , the probability of survival to time @xmath5 of all @xmath128 walkers to positions @xmath133 , and of all @xmath131 walls , is the following product of factors for each walker :    @xmath182    here either of the two equivalent forms for @xmath153 ( given in ( [ eq : q12_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : q12_2 ] ) ) can be used .",

    "with all gaps starting at the same value , @xmath143 , eq([eq : survival_prob_exp ] ) gives @xmath199 decaying exponentially with rate @xmath200 .",
    "for the same initial condition in process ii the corresponding decay starts similarly but the greater possibility of gaps increasing allows a crossover to later power - law decay @xcite .",
    "for persistence the late time regime of interest is where a large fraction of the walkers have been annihilated , the @xmath143 s have become large , and the rare survivors are of interest .",
    "all this occurs well after the crossover just referred to , which allows a less drastic diminution of the number of surviving walls in ii than in i. but simple qualitative arguments do not easily explain the faster decay of unflipped arrowheads in ii than i. different initial gap distributions can lead to different or no crossovers .",
    "for example distributions giving weight to very small gaps allow much smaller characteristic and crossover times , and most initial distributions give rise to long - time distributions which are invariant except for a common inflation of gaps with time ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the dynamics of approach to equilibrium in large systems . every arrowhead configuration has alternating @xmath1 and @xmath2 domain walls and the approach to steady state involves the decrease of their number under annihilation kinetics @xmath12 .",
    "we study the case in which @xmath1 walls diffuse while @xmath2 walls are stationary , as appropriate to the limit @xmath32 ; the effects of @xmath2 wall diffusion will be the subject of section vi .",
    "we monitor domain wall densities and persistence properties of arrowheads as the system evolves towards equilibrium .",
    "we use two types of initial conditions : a ) random : with random placement of arrowheads , leading to random locations of domain walls .",
    "b ) periodic : with equally - long alternating stretches of ... @xmath38 ... and ... @xmath202 ... , implying a periodic arrangement of domain walls . in either case , @xmath1 and @xmath2 domain walls alternate in sequence .",
    "as we will see , there are some similarities to , and some marked differences from , glauber - ising systems , whose dynamics is governed by the single - species annihilation process @xmath4 .    evidently , arrowhead kinematics leads to alternating @xmath1 and @xmath2 walls in all configurations , including initial conditions .",
    "this is very different from the situation in several studies of @xmath12 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles are placed at random ( @xcite ) . in the latter case ,",
    "concentration fluctuations decay very slowly and dominate the late time dynamics . our study is closer to that of @xcite as will be discussed in section vi .",
    "numerical results are obtained using monte carlo simulations where system size is typically @xmath20 = 10000 and averaging is done over few hundreds of histories .",
    "as time passes , diffusing @xmath1 walls annihilate with stationary @xmath2 s . in section iv with a finite number of walls",
    ", we saw that the all - walker survival probability decays exponentially in time , with a decay time which varies inversely with the number of walkers @xmath128 .",
    "this time is vanishingly small in the present context , where the number of walls is macroscopic .",
    "we focus , to start with , on the wall density and how it decays in time .",
    "since the underlying dynamics of the mobile species is purely diffusive , we expect that the result would be qualitatively similar to that for @xmath4 for the glauber - ising case .",
    "this is borne out by our numerical results which show the decay of wall density for the two systems , with initial conditions a ) and b ) for each case .",
    "the density follows a @xmath203 decay with @xmath204 in all cases .",
    "[ fig : domain_wall_decay ]        this result agrees with that of @xcite where it was found that @xmath205 when the rate of the asep - like moves is set equal to zero .",
    "persistence quantifies how much of particular properties of the initial configuration survive without change up to time @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these properties could either be local ( for example the orientation of individual arrowheads ) or global ( for instance the majority orientation of arrowheads ) .    in spin models ,",
    "it is customary to monitor the fraction @xmath206 of persistent spins , i.e. those which have not flipped up to time @xmath5 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath206 can be thought of as the probability that a given spin has not flipped .",
    "the persistence probability follows a power law decay , @xmath207 .",
    "a closed form expression has been obtained for @xmath8 for the @xmath208-state potts models on a one - dimensional lattice ; for the ising model , the result is @xmath209 .",
    "our data for the persistent fraction @xmath206 in the arrowhead problem are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : persist ] along - side the data for the ising model .",
    "it is evident that the decay exponent is substantially different ; we find the value for @xmath8 is 0.245 , intriguingly close to @xmath210 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath8 is independent of the initial condition a ) or b ) .        the global persistence @xmath211 is defined as the fraction of histories in which a global variable has not changed sign .",
    "an appropriate global variable is the ` order parameter ' @xmath212 where @xmath213 and @xmath214 are respectively the number of right and left pointing arrowheads . from our numerical results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : global_persist ] we find @xmath215 where the value of @xmath216 is consistent with @xmath9  which agrees with the value for @xmath216 in the ising case .        for the ising model ,",
    "the result @xmath217 was derived in @xcite by observing that the scaled order parameter ( analogous to @xmath218 ) obeys random walk dynamics provided we redefine the time variable to be @xmath219 .",
    "the only input required for this argument is that the density of surviving walkers falls as @xmath6 .",
    "since this is true in our case as well , the result @xmath217 holds here as well .",
    "since individual entities generally decay faster than global variables , we expect that the value of @xmath8 should be greater than or equal to @xmath216 .",
    "thus we surmise that the value of the site persistence exponent is also @xmath9 . in all other systems we are aware of ,",
    "@xmath220 ; this is the first instance where the equality @xmath221 seems to hold .",
    "in order to investigate the universality of the results obtained in section v , we have studied the effects of letting the @xmath2 walls diffuse , by allowing the moves of eq .",
    "( [ eq : moves_2 ] ) in addition to those of eq .",
    "( [ eq : moves_1 ] ) .    in the original arrowhead problem , movement of a @xmath2 wall would require a large enough gap to open up for it to occur without violating the hard - core constraint ; in the equilibrium state , this would be extremely rare if the density is large .",
    "thus the moves considered ( eq.([eq : moves_2 ] ) ) are best viewed as put in ` by hand ' ; they would need a softening of the hard - core constraint between arrowheads at @xmath2 interfaces in order to happen .",
    "our motivation in studying such moves is purely to investigate the theoretical question of universality with respect to allowing @xmath2 wall diffusion , partly motivated by the importance of the question for the @xmath12 problem , and partly by the observations of @xcite where the authors observed a continuous variation of decay exponents as some rates were changed in their model .",
    "we first examined numerically the manner in which the density of walls decays .",
    "we found that it follows @xmath222 where the value of @xmath29 appears to remain fixed at @xmath223 , as for the arrowhead and ising cases .",
    "the data is not displayed , but falls in between the two limiting cases shown in fig.[fig : domain_wall_decay ] .",
    "this is in contrast to the variation of @xmath29 observed in @xcite when the rate of the asep - like move in their model was varied .",
    "coming to the question of persistence , namely the probability that a given spin has not flipped up to time @xmath5 , we note that the question may be posed in the context of a finite number of walls , as considered in section iv .",
    "in fact , the simplest case is most illuminating : three walkers , with a diffusion constant @xmath224 for the outer two walkers , and @xmath225 for the central walker .",
    "the survival problem can be solved exactly by a mapping to the motion of a composite particle in a wedge - shaped domain @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath226    the significant point is that @xmath8 depends explicitly on the ratio @xmath227 .",
    "it is instructive to check limiting cases .",
    "if the central particle is a stationary @xmath2 particle surrounded by two @xmath1 s , we obtain @xmath8 = 1 , implying a faster decay than with a single @xmath1 particle ( @xmath228 ) . on the other hand , if the central particle is an @xmath1 surrounded by two @xmath2 particles , we obtain @xmath229 , consistent with the exponential decay found in section iv .    to see whether this dependence of the power law exponent on diffusion constants stays also for persistence properties in a thermodynamically large system , we numerically studied the fraction of persistent spins @xmath206 as a function of @xmath5 , and found a definite variation of the power law exponent @xmath8 as the ratio of diffusion constants @xmath45 is varied .",
    "the data fig .",
    "[ fig : persist_var ] indicate a smooth variation of @xmath8 from about 0.25 in the arrowhead model @xmath230 to 0.375 in the ising model @xmath231 .",
    "however , the global persistence @xmath211 continues to show a @xmath232 decay as in the arrowhead and ising cases .",
    "this is not unexpected , as following the argument in section v , the decay of @xmath211 is related to the manner in which the density of domain walls decays , and as we have seen above , this does not depend on @xmath45 .",
    "in this paper we have studied a system of stochastically reorienting arrowheads in one dimension .",
    "our study of the static properties and the dynamics of approach to the steady state has touched on several issues , and we discuss our results in that context .",
    "the equilibrium state of our system approaches an orientationally ordered state as the density increases .",
    "the origin of order is entropic , as follows from the fact that arrowheads may never overlap , implying that every allowed configuration is equally likely . for a fixed total length ,",
    "it is evident that the entropy of translation is largest in an orientationally ordered state , as then there is no constraint on the locations of arrowhead vertices other than that they must maintain a sequence .",
    "this contribution to the entropy dominates at large density ; at moderate values of @xmath35 , it must compete with the configurational entropy of the locations of interfaces .",
    "the spatial extent of the order is quantified by the correlation length and the persistence length , and the calculations in section iii show that both diverge as @xmath233 as @xmath32 .",
    "understanding the dynamics of approach to the ordered state is greatly facilitated by the observation that there are two types , @xmath1 ( @xmath234 ) and @xmath2(@xmath235 ) , of arrowhead interfaces obeying @xmath12 dynamics .",
    "our study has a bearing on a couple of interconnected issues in this two - species annihilation problem . in this problem",
    ", the influence of initial conditions on long - time decays has long been recognized . initial conditions in which the sequence of @xmath1 s and @xmath2 s is random give rise to long - lived concentration fluctuations in the number of @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles , which in turn give rise to multiple length scales and slow down the dynamics strongly @xcite .",
    "by contrast , under initial conditions in which the imbalance between @xmath1 and @xmath2 particle numbers remains of the order of unity in every stretch , the two species are well mixed , and the decay exponent @xmath205 .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that when alternation follows the pattern @xmath236 there are multiplicative logarithms for even @xmath167 .",
    "such initial conditions have been studied in the context of conserved lattice gas models , on identifying pairs of sites with @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles @xcite . in the arrowhead model , even a random placement of arrowheads results in strict alternation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 interfaces ; thus our result @xmath205 ( section v ) with no evidence of logarithms is fully consistent with the above .",
    "another important issue concerns the fact that in our problem , the diffusion constants for @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles are not equal ; in fact the @xmath2 particles do not diffuse at all in the limit of infinite arrowhead density .",
    "how pertinent is this for long time decays of survival probabilities under @xmath12 dynamics ? with a finite number @xmath128 of walkers , we showed that the all - walker survival probability falls exponentially rapidly in time , with the decay time being inversely proportional to @xmath128 .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the power law decay with power @xmath237 found with equal diffusion constants , as appropriate to @xmath4 . in the thermodynamically large system",
    ", we found the persistence probability falls as a power law for both @xmath12 and @xmath4 , but importantly , the powers differ , being close to @xmath9 in the former case , and @xmath17 in the latter .",
    "we conclude with some comments on universality .",
    "the studies of @xcite on a generalized model with asep - like moves together with annihilation indicate a violation of universality , for example in the power laws for domain wall density , as the asep rates are changed . in the reorienting arrowhead model",
    ", there is no asep move .",
    "we find that on varying the diffusion constant for @xmath2 particles from 0 to the value for @xmath1 particles , globally averaged properties such as the number of domain walls , or global persistence , remain universal .",
    "but more delicate properties such as single site persistence are found to exhibit a continuous variation of power laws as the ratio of diffusion constants is varied .",
    "this indicates a violation of universality , but at a weaker level than in the studies of @xcite .",
