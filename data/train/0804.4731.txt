    "many real - world systems range from the structure of internet or www to social relationship between human society , or prey - predator relationship in food webs are described topologically as scale - free networks ( sfns ) @xcite . in a sfn , the degree distribution @xmath5 , where degree @xmath6 is the number of edges connected to a node , has a power - law decay @xmath7 .",
    "the degree exponent @xmath8 takes @xmath9 in many real networks @xcite .",
    "sfn studies have been carried out actively in recent years , including various processes taking thereon , e.g. , network failure , spread of infections , or interacting systems , which attract numerous applications and fundamental interests about critical phenomena @xcite . among them , the ferromagnetic ising model on sfns is a basic prototype to understand how network topology influences cooperative behaviors on sfns . indeed , previous studies have demonstrated the extreme influence of the network topology by both analytical @xcite and numerical methods @xcite .",
    "for example , dorogovtsev et al . @xcite",
    "analyzed the ising model on an uncorrelated sfn model with a power - law degree distribution by the bethe approach to show that the phase transition exists at a finite temperature for @xmath10 , while the system remains in the ferromagnetic phase at any finite temperature for @xmath11 , and its critical exponents vary depending on @xmath8 .    in the previous approaches ,",
    "rather dense part of a sfn has been analyzed in details , while our knowledge of how the spins on _ leaves _ ( nodes whose degree is one ) behave is still missing . in practice , many real sfns have a number of leaves .",
    "how does such network topology influence the critical behaviors ?",
    "this paper focuses on a simple case ; the ising model on a tree - like sfn which includes many leaves , but has no cyclic path .",
    "we note that the ferromagnetic ising model on trees behaves quite differently from that on regular lattices ; the spin system on a tree has no spontaneous magnetization at any finite temperature , while its zero - field susceptibility remains to diverge below a certain temperature @xmath1 ( we call it the _ divergent temperature _ ) @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the leaf - spins are extremely sensitive to the external field below @xmath1 .",
    "our aim is to clarify the relation between the divergent temperature @xmath1 and the degree distribution @xmath5 . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the ising model on the _ growing random network _ ( gn ) _ model _ introduced by krapivsky and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the gn model probabilistically generates a sampled tree @xmath12 with @xmath13 nodes as follows .",
    "one starts with one isolated node . at each time step ,",
    "a new node is added and links to a preexisting node .",
    "the probability that the new node links to a node with degree @xmath6 is proportional to _ the attachment kernel _ @xmath14 . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the linear attachment kernel @xmath0 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the degree distribution of a resulting tree is determined by the offset @xmath2 in the attachment kernel . for the infinite offset @xmath16",
    ", the degree distribution reduces to the exponential form @xmath17 . for a finite offset @xmath2 ,",
    "the degree distribution satisfies a power - law decay @xmath7 , where the degree exponent is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "as the offset @xmath2 is smaller , the resulting degree distribution @xmath5 is more fat - tailed .",
    "particularly , the gn model with the no offset @xmath19 corresponds to so - called barabsi - albert tree @xcite , which has the degree exponent @xmath20 .",
    "we investigate how the divergent temperature @xmath1 is related to @xmath2 to show the extreme sensitivity of trees with fat - tailed degree distribution ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we introduce the ising model on the gn model . in section",
    "[ infinite ] , we derive the exact expression for the system susceptibility and the divergent temperature for the infinite offset case @xmath16 . in section [ finite ] , we give an estimate of @xmath1 for the general offset case . in section [ numcal ] ,",
    "we show our numerical results to support the validity of our estimate , and suggest that for the no offset case , @xmath1 diverges and an unusual scaling exists .",
    "section [ summary ] is devoted to summary .",
    "in this section , we introduce our model ; the ising model on the gn model . the hamiltonian is as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ferromagnetic interaction , @xmath24 is the external magnetic field , and @xmath25 is the ising spin variable on the node @xmath26 .",
    "the first sum is over all edges of a network , and the second one is over all nodes . in the following sections , we calculate the zero - field susceptibility of this model .",
    "the zero - field susceptibility is expressed in terms of the spin - spin correlation functions as @xmath27 , where the angular bracket denotes the usual thermal average . for trees ,",
    "the correlation function between two ising spins @xmath28 and @xmath29 on a sampled tree @xmath12 is given as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the temperature , and @xmath34 is the path length between the node @xmath26 and @xmath35 on the tree @xmath12 .",
    "accordingly , the _ one - spin _",
    "susceptibility @xmath36 of a spin on the node @xmath26 of a sampled tree @xmath12 is @xmath37 and the system susceptibility @xmath38 note that the system susceptibility is related with the so called _ average correlation volume _",
    "@xcite : @xmath40 .",
    "in this section , we consider the gn model with the infinite offset @xmath16 .",
    "we derive the exact form for the mean system susceptibility @xmath41 and the divergent temperature @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the normalized probability of a tree @xmath12 .",
    "suppose that t@xmath44 is created by attaching the @xmath45-th node to the @xmath46-th node of a preexisting tree t@xmath47 .",
    "then the distance from the new node to all others is given as @xmath48 for @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the diagonal element is zero : @xmath50 .",
    "note that for trees , a path between each two nodes is unique , so the matrix elements do not change their values once formed during the growth process .",
    "so we obtain the recursion relation for the averaged total susceptibility @xmath51 as follows : @xmath52 the first term of the r.h.s .",
    "is @xmath53 and the second term of the r.h.s .",
    "is @xmath54 here we use @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the conditional probability that the newly - added node links to a preexisting node labeled as @xmath46 on the tree @xmath12 . combining eqs.([batparts2 ] ) and",
    "( [ batparts3 ] ) with eq.([batparts1 ] ) gives the evolution of @xmath57 as @xmath58 for the general offset case , it is hard to solve @xmath57 expicitly since the probability @xmath56 is proportional to the kernel @xmath14 .",
    "fortunately , the infinite offset case is within reaching distance . in this case , the conditional probability is independent of which node is attached : @xmath59 for any @xmath46 . thus eq.([batfrec ] ) is evaluated as @xmath60 this recursion equation is solved explicitly to obtain the mean system susceptibility as @xmath61 by evaluating the temperature below which the system susceptibility ( [ totalchiform ] ) diverges , we find that the divergent temperature is given as ( see appendix [ derdivexpotree ] ) @xmath62 moreover , expanding eq.([totalchiform ] ) around the divergent temperature , we obtain the finite size scaling form for the infinite offset case : @xmath63 , \\label{infinitefss}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is a scaling function in this case .",
    "in this section , we proceed to the general offset case .",
    "we give an estimate of @xmath1 by calculating a lower bound of the system susceptibility .",
    "first , we can calculate approximately the one - spin susceptibility of the initial node @xmath65 .",
    "our calculation is based on a mean field approach by szabo et al.@xcite ; the original stochastic model is approximated by a uniform branching tree where every node on any level has the same number of offsprings .",
    "let @xmath66 denote the number of nodes at the @xmath67-th level , which means the distance from the initial node is @xmath67 , on the tree with @xmath13 nodes .",
    "when the new node is added to the tree with @xmath13 nodes , the probability that the new node links to any node at the @xmath67-th level is @xmath68 here the new node is stationed at the @xmath69-th level , so we obtain @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and the initial condition is @xmath73 for all @xmath13 .",
    "now we introduce the generating function @xmath74 note that @xmath75 is related to @xmath65 as @xmath76 . from eq.([nnlrec ] ) , we obtain the recursion relation for the generating function as follows : @xmath77 it is easily solved that @xmath78 for @xmath79 , the summation of the second term can be approximated as @xmath80 so that @xmath81 thus we obtain the one - spin susceptibility of the initial node as @xmath82 which diverges for any @xmath33 and any @xmath83 .    now we evaluate a lower bound of the system susceptibility .",
    "we consider a subtree which consists of a node at the @xmath84-th level and its descendents .",
    "the number of node at the @xmath85-th level is given as @xmath86 . among the total susceptibility of the subtree",
    ", the contribution from the node - pairs whose paths go through the level @xmath84 is @xmath87 t^2 g_{n , s+1}^2 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath88 corresponds to the one - spin susceptibility of the node at the @xmath84-th level .",
    "the total susceptibility of the whole tree is evaluated as @xmath89 the second term is non - negative for @xmath90 , so we obtain a lower bound of the system susceptibility as @xmath91 note that the exponent includes @xmath92 . by evaluating where this bound diverges , we obtain an estimate of @xmath1 : @xmath93 which reduces the exact solution ( [ infinitedivt ] ) for the infinite offset @xmath16 .",
    "this relation indicates that as the offset is smaller , the divergent temperature is higher .",
    "particularly , we immediately find that @xmath1 diverges for @xmath94 .",
    "in this section , we calculate the zero - field susceptibilities numerically for the gn models with several values of offset @xmath2 . we generate trees for a given offset to calculate the susceptibilities by using eq.([falktheorem ] ) .",
    "first , we show the results for the infinite offset case @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ comparisonplot ] compares the numerical result for the system susceptibility with the analytical forms ( [ totalchiform ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "we set @xmath95 .",
    "we find that the analytical forms agree well with the numerical ones .",
    "figure [ finitesizescalingoffsetinfinity ] plots the finite size scaling around the divergent temperature .",
    "the number of nodes is taken from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "the system susceptibilities are averaged over @xmath98 samples .",
    "we find that the scaling works quite well .",
    "next , we turn to the finite offset case . figures [ finitesizescalingoffset ] plots the finite size scaling around our estimate @xmath1 for the mean system susceptibility with the offset @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . as a result",
    ", we find that our finite size scaling similar to that for the infinite offset ( [ infinitefss ] ) is quite well fitted as long as an offset is not small .",
    "these results support that our estimate gives the exact divergent temperature . on the other hand",
    ", our scaling does not work well for the small offsets , e.g. , @xmath102 or @xmath103 , where scaling exponents there may depend on the offset strongly .    finally , we consider the no offset case . in fig.[nooffset]-(a ) , we plot the mean system susceptibilities @xmath104 $ ] with several nodes from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",
    "now we rescale these susceptibilities as @xmath107 / \\log n$ ] .",
    "the rescaled system susceptibilities are quite well fitted for very wide temperature range as seen in fig.[nooffset]-(b ) .",
    "this indicates that @xmath108 goes to the infinity as @xmath109 .",
    "in addition , our result means that the following unusual scaling for the system susceptibility ( in other words , for the average correlation volume @xmath110 ) is satisfied : @xmath111^{\\log",
    "n } , \\label{scaleform}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is a scaling function .",
    "unfortunately , we have not obtained the derivation of this scaling yet . but this relation is derived partially by the following approximation .",
    "bollobs and riordan @xcite derived that the expected number @xmath113 of shortest paths of length @xmath67 for the barabsi - albert tree with @xmath13 nodes is given as @xmath114 for @xmath79 . using this distribution ,",
    "we approximate the system susceptibility as @xmath115 } , \\label{batapprox}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath116 .",
    "this approximation shows the system susceptibility @xmath108 holds the scaling relation ( [ scaleform ] ) at least in a low temperature region .",
    "interestingly , this scaling form remains to be satisfied even at a high temperature where this approximation ( [ batapprox ] ) is not valid .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the zero - field susceptibility of the ising model on the gn model with the attachment kernel @xmath0 .",
    "our main finding of this paper is that the divergent temperature @xmath1 of the gn model with the offset @xmath2 is given by @xmath117 .",
    "the exact expression of the susceptibility for the infinite offset , and the finite size scaling of the susceptibilities for the finite offsets support our estimate is exact .",
    "the finite size scaling form ( [ infinitefss ] ) implies that @xmath118 can be regarded as the characteristic system length @xmath119 , so that ( [ infinitefss ] ) can be read as @xmath120 with @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "our result means that as the offset @xmath2 is smaller , the divergent temperature @xmath1 is higher ( fig.[schemaplot ] ) .",
    "particularly , @xmath1 diverges when @xmath123 , that is , the degree exponent @xmath11 .",
    "as is pointed out in @xcite , a long - ranged spin correlation covers the whole system below @xmath1 if we apply a small local external field on the node @xmath26 .",
    "so one finds that applying a small local field , or maybe adding a few shortcuts to spin systems on a tree with a fat - tailed degree distribution induces a long - ranged ordering _ at any finite temperature_. interestingly , our result shows that the susceptibilities for the no offset obey unusual scaling ( [ scaleform ] ) .",
    "we will investigate the origin of this feature in the future .",
    "this work is supported by the 21st century center of excellence ( coe ) program entitled `` topological science and technology '' , hokkaido university .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the divergence temperature of of the gn model with the infinite offset @xmath16 .",
    "we rewrite the system susceptibility ( [ totalchiform ] ) as follows : @xmath124 where @xmath125 now , we can derive that the divergence occurs at @xmath126 . at @xmath126 ,",
    "one find @xmath127 to reduce the system susceptibility ( [ fnandsm ] ) to @xmath128 i.e. , to the harmonic series .",
    "thus , the system susceptibility diverges at @xmath126 in the limit @xmath109 .",
    "we find immediately that the system susceptibility diverges at least for @xmath129 , since @xmath130 increases monotonously with @xmath92 for any @xmath13 .",
    "now we show that the system susceptibility can not diverge for @xmath131 . from eq.([smrec ] ) , we obtain the following relations for @xmath132 : @xmath133 and @xmath134 the iterative substitutions of eqs.([srelation1 ] ) and ( [ srelation2 ] ) allow one to the following transformation : @xmath135 in the end , one find @xmath136 this upper bound converges for @xmath137 , so @xmath130 does nt diverge there .",
    "thus , we find that the divergent temperature @xmath1 is decided by @xmath138 .",
