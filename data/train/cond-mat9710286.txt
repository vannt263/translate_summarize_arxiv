    "quantum critical phenomena and quantum disorder in strongly correlated many - body systems have been a subject of much interest lately .",
    "they have been invoked to account for many properties of high temperature superconductors @xcite , for non fermi - liquid behavior in heavy fermion materials @xcite , and for a variety of other interesting systems ranging from superconductor - insulator transitions to the quantum hall effect @xcite . in many problems it is not possible to fine tune the system parameters to be right at the quantum critical point . nevertheless , the quantum critical point controls their behavior above some very low temperature scale @xcite .",
    "the aim of our study is to develop a method that will allow us to calculate the temperature dependence of thermodynamic quantities with high accuracy for many model hamiltonians , when the system parameters are in the quantum disordered phase or near a zero temperature quantum critical point .",
    "quantum spin - systems provide a particularly rich variety of models and real materials where quantum critical phenomena can be studied .",
    "there exist many experimental realizations of spin - ladders and alternating chains @xcite .",
    "bilayer heisenberg model is considered relevant to high temperature superconductors @xcite . recently",
    ", the material @xmath0 has attracted considerable interest @xcite .",
    "the spins in these materials are arranged in a novel geometrical arrangement , which allows for many possible types of spin - disordered ground states and quantum critical points .",
    "finite temperature properties of such systems have been studied before by finite - size studies , including exact diagonalization @xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , and by high temperature expansions @xcite .",
    "the latter method performs poorly at low temperatures for many parameter regimes of interest .",
    "exact diagonalization , in higher than one dimension , is generally limited to fairly small systems and extrapolation to thermodynamic limit is unreliable .",
    "the quantum monte carlo method is perhaps the most accurate to date , but it suffers from the sign problem when frustration is present .    here , we combine many - body perturbation theory with cluster expansions to develop high - order strong - coupling expansions for thermodynamic quantities , such as the bulk susceptibility and the specific heat , at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "the resulting series are perturbation expansions in the weaker couplings , whose coefficients depend on temperature . for the bilayer heisenberg model , these series show excellent convergence at all temperatures for a range of parameters ( without using series extrapolation methods such as pade approximants ) .",
    "even when the system parameters are tuned to the quantum critical point , the series converges very well down to fairly low temperatures , comparable to the lowest temperatures accessible in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the method should prove useful for frustrated as well as quenched random spin syatems .",
    "it can also be applied to electronic models such as t - j and hubbard or kondo lattice models .",
    "being a finite temperature perturbation expansion , it is not limited to systems with non - degenerate ground states .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii we discuss the basic perturbation theory . in section iii",
    "we introduce some techniques that are needed for an effective computer implementation of the method . in section",
    "iv the series expansions for the bilayer heisenberg model is presented . in section",
    "v we compare our series with quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "finally , in section vi we present our conclusions and suggest future directions .",
    "we are interested in systems which are described by a hamiltonian @xmath1 here , @xmath2 consists of all couplings within an elementary cluster , whereas , @xmath3 describes interactions between different such units .",
    "the basic idea of cluster expansions is to exploit the fact that in any finite order of perturbation theory only a finite number of these elementary units can be coupled together and thus expansions for a thermodynamic system can be obtained exactly by carrying out perturbation theory just for these few finite - clusters or graphs ( in this paper we will refer to them as graphs to distinguish them from the elementary clusters which define the hamiltonian @xmath2 ) . a thermodynamic quantity , such as magnetic susceptibility per elementary cluster , @xmath4 , for the lattice @xmath5 can be written as @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the susceptibility of the elmentary cluster for @xmath8 and the sum runs over all connected graphs of the lattice .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 , called the lattice constant of the graph , is defined as the number of ways per elementary cluster that the graph @xmath10 can be embedded in the lattice .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 is the weight of the graph @xmath10 defined by the recursion relation , @xmath12 where , @xmath13 is the number of sites in the graph and the sum over @xmath14 runs over all proper subgraphs of the graph @xmath10 . for a graph @xmath10 with @xmath15 bonds",
    "it can be shown @xcite that @xmath16 .",
    "so far the formalism is identical to a standard high temperature expansion .",
    "the novelty arises in the calculation of @xmath17 for a finite graph . in order to do that",
    ", we only need to consider the spins in that graph and the interactions @xmath2 and @xmath3 between these spins . to calculate expansions at arbitrary temperature , we exploit the following relation @xmath18 where @xmath19 are n - fold integrals given by , @xmath20 here",
    ", the operators , @xmath21 have the standard time dependence of the interaction representation @xmath22 thus , the partition function can be reduced to the expression , @xmath23 where @xmath24 are given by @xmath25 \\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] it is evident that in order to evaluate these expressions , we need to work in a basis in which @xmath2 is diagonal .",
    "this basis is simply a direct product of the eigen - basis for elementary clusters . thus calculating thermodynamic quantities",
    "is straightforward if the matrix elements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are known in this basis . in the next section",
    "we discuss an efficient method for calculating these traces and integrals .",
    "the basic energy scale in this problem is set by the level spacing @xmath26 in the spectrum of the unperturbed part @xmath2 .",
    "measuring temperature in units of this quantity one finds that calculating @xmath24 requires repeated integrations over functions of type : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are integers and @xmath30 .",
    "it is then easy to see that the @xmath31 form a closed set , because    @xmath32    these equations allow for an iterative evaluation of the multiple integrals entering eqn.([z_n ] ) .",
    "one finds that the coefficients @xmath24 are finite polynomials in the two variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    in the following",
    "we will apply this series expansion method to systems where the basic cluster consists of a pair of @xmath35 spins coupled by a heisenberg exchange @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is the singlet - triplet spacing in the spectrum of @xmath2 . in this case",
    "it turns out to be more convenient to use the variables @xmath37 instead of the variables @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , is the zeroth order partition function .",
    "here , we apply the method to the spin - half bilayer heisenberg model , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath40 here , the index @xmath41 enumerates sites on a two dimensional square lattice and @xmath42 are pairs of nearest neighbour sites on this lattice . the expansion parameter is given by ratio of the inter dimer to the intra dimer coupling : @xmath43 the series for the susceptibility @xmath4 and the logarithm of the partition function @xmath44 per dimer are presented in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the series can also be obtained on the www .",
    "the acess adress is given at the end of this article .",
    "in this section we show the convergence of the expansions by comparing partial sums of different order and by comparing with the quantum monte carlo data . it is known from a number of studies at @xmath45 that this model has a quantum critical point at @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we show here results in the quantum disordered phase ( at @xmath47 ) and near the quantum critical point at @xmath48 .    in figures ( [ fig : chi_d ] ) and ( [ fig : c_d ] ) the susceptibility and specific heat are plotted as a function of temperature for @xmath47 .",
    "one can see that there is excellent convergence at all temperatures .",
    "the quantum critical regime was investigated by chubukov , sachdev and ye@xcite by a large - n expansion of the quantum nonlinear @xmath49-model .",
    "they obtained very detailed results for the low temperature behaviour .",
    "in particular the following predictions for the susceptibility and the specific heat _ per unit cell _ were derived : @xmath50 \\\\   c & = & \\frac{3 \\zeta ( 3)}{\\pi } k_{\\rm b }    \\left ( \\frac{k_{\\rm b}t}{\\hbar c } \\right)^2     n \\left [ \\frac{4}{5 } - \\frac{0.3344}{n } + o(n^{-2 } ) \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the spin wave velocity . from various zero temperature calculations its value",
    "is known to be @xcite : @xmath52 evaluating these equations for @xmath53 gives for the susceptibility and specific heat _ per site _ :",
    "@xmath54 here temperature is in units of the intra dimer coupling @xmath36 .",
    "a very sensitive measure for quantum criticality is the wilson ratio defined by @xmath55 the numerical value of this dimensionless quantity follows immediately from eqns.([eqn : chi_qc ] ) and ( [ eqn : c_qc ] ) : @xmath56    in figures [ fig : chi_qc ] , [ fig : inte_qc ] , [ fig : cv_qc ] , and [ fig : wr_qc ] , the susceptibility , internal energy , specific heat , and wilson ratio for the model are shown and compared with monte carlo data and with the asymptotic quantum critical predictions .",
    "we see that the series converges extremely well down to fairly low temperatures .",
    "however , the convergence appears to break down just as the asymptotic quantum critical behavior sets in .",
    "the finite series become oscillatory at these very low temperatures .",
    "the activated behaviour at extremly low temperatures as seen in figures [ fig : chi_qc ] , [ fig : cv_qc ] and [ fig : wr_qc ] is also an artifact of finite series . in principle",
    "various extrapolation techniques , e.g. pade approximants , can be used to enhance the convergence in this region . here , we restrict the analysis to the temperature range where the series converge .    one interesting result to emerge from this study is that asymptotic quantum critical scaling occurs in the model only at very low temperatures , much lower than anticipated before . the uniform susceptibility between @xmath57 and @xmath58 appears nearly linear but is not strictly so .",
    "there is a shoulder around @xmath59 , which is present in both the series results and the monte carlo data .    on the other hand , many amplitude ratios follow the universal quantum critical predictions even above @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "thus , the extent of the quantum critical regime in 2d systems appears to strongly depend on the quantity studied .",
    "clearly , the role of lattice corrections needs to be better understood @xcite .",
    "in this paper we presented a practical method to calculate high order strong coupling expansions for quantum statistical models at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "the method was applied to the bilayer heisenberg model , where it shows excellent convergence even near the quantum critical point . in a companion paper",
    ", we will discuss application of these methods to alternating spin - chains and spin - ladders .",
    "the method is also applicable to frustrated and quenched random spin models as well as to hubbard or kondo models around the strong coupling limit .",
    "we are preparing to pursue these calculations in the future .",
    "series for the susceptibility @xmath4 , internal energy @xmath60 and specific heat @xmath61 may be obtained on the www .",
    "in addition a fortran program to read the data files and sum the series is also available .",
    "we are greatful to a. sandvik for providing the qmc data .",
