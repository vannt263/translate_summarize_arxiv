    "most importantly , it is not known a priori if a complex langevin simulation will converge to a stationary distribution .",
    "even if it does , there are multiple stationary distributions that satisfy stationary limit equations ( fokker - planck equation @xcite or schwinger - dyson equation @xcite ) and it is not known how to identify to which one of these that the complex langevin equation converges .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of these issues and references to literature .",
    "identification of the particular stationary distribution sampled by the complex langevin equation needs input from the dynamics of the complex langevin simulation .",
    "analysis depending only on the quantities in the stationary limit has not been successful in differentiating between stationary distributions . to account for this fact",
    ", we introduce an effective potential approach to complex langevin equations .",
    "even though this effective potential does not have all the properties of the conventional quantum field theory effective action , we show that it governs the probability that the spacetime and langevin time average of the fields takes on specific values . in the infinite langevin time limit",
    ", it is shown that the spacetime and langevin time average of the field must be equal to the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "as in quantum field theory , a loop expansion for this effective action can be defined .",
    "the parameter that defines loops is a factor that multiplies the noise in the complex langevin equation .",
    "the same parameter is shown to count derivatives in the schwinger - dyson equation derived from the action @xmath1 .",
    "this point is important , because it is known that the stationary distributions of the complex langevin equation are complexified path integral solutions of the schwinger - dyson equation , i.e. see @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this paper is to use the minimum of the effective action to identify the stationary distribution to which the complex langevin equation converges by matching the loop expansion with the derivative expansion .",
    "this provides an approach to addressing the multiple stationary distributions problem .",
    "in two recent studies @xcite , the classical fixed point structure of complex langevin equations were shown to be important for the convergence behavior .",
    "our results will also parallel this result since to leading order the minima of the effective potential will be given by classical fixed points .",
    "the next order will be used to remove the degeneracy and this will lead us to the identification of the stationary distribution that is sampled by the complex langevin simulation .",
    "we start by reviewing relevant results in section [ one ] .",
    "we then introduce the effective potential in a lattice setting , discuss its properties and calculate it to one loop order ( section [ two ] ) .",

    "in fact , this is what we will do in the rest of this paper .",
    "note that most of the time in the literature @xmath9 is set to 1 .",
    "there is only a real noise in the complex langevin equation .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this may lead to initial condition dependence of the stationary distribution sampled by the complex langevin equation .",
    "this happens because for some actions the complex langevin dynamics may be confined to sampling in lower or upper half planes depending on the initial condition , not having access to all of the complex plane . in this paper",
    ", we want to avoid such initial condition dependence and assume that the stationary distribution sampled by the complex langevin equation is unique .",
