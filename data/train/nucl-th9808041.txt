    "in the simplest models , mesons are bound states of a valance quark - antiquark pair confined by the strong force .",
    "even for such a simple case a covariant model is needed when the mesons are composed of light quarks with high momentum components . however , covariant models require knowledge of the lorentz structure of the confining interaction , and it turns out that some choices of lorentz structure for some equations will produce mesons which decay . when no mechanism for decay has been included in the model ( which will be the situation for the cases discussed in this paper ) , this is a sign that the solutions are unphysical . in may be acceptable for an equation to produce unstable ( i.e. unphysical ) solutions /it if these solutions are confined to a region of the spectrum which can be precisely characterized and systematically ignored , but if this is not possible equations which produce such unphysical solutions are unsatisfactory . in this paper",
    "we study confining potentials with scalar and time - like vector exchanges , and find that the stability of such interactions depends on the kind of relativistic equation used for the description of the interaction .",
    "this is not the first time that the stability of covariant models of confinement has been addressed .",
    "several papers have been written on this topic , some with contradictory conclusions .",
    "two examples which illustrate this are papers titled _ an exact argument against an effective vector exchange for the confining quark - antiquark potential _",
    "@xcite , and _ evidence against a scalar confining potential in qcd _ @xcite .",
    "if both papers are correct , this would indicate that , at best , the lorentz structure for the potential is more complex than a simple scalar or vector exchange .",
    "our research into the question of stability was motivated by the paper of parramore and piekarewicz@xcite , which found that the salpeter equation was stable when the vector strength exceeded the scalar strength .",
    "this seemed counter intuitive to us , since it is well known that , because of the famous klein paradox , the dirac equation is stable only when the potential is predominately scalar .",
    "their result also contradicted the work of another group @xcite who found that the salpeter equation was stable for a pure scalar confining interaction , provided the quark mass was sufficiently large .",
    "we begin the discussion by making a distinction between instabilities which are physical and those which are unphysical .",
    "real mesons have a finite lifetime and can decay either through the strong interaction or the electroweak interaction .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 can decay into a photon and a @xmath1 through the electroweak interaction shown in fig .",
    "it can also decay into a @xmath1 and @xmath2 via the strong interaction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figb ] . in this paper",
    "we describe mesons which are isolated from external influences ( including vacuum fluxuations ) , and use an equation which excludes the electroweak interaction and does not include any mechanism for the production of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "hence both of these decay mechanisms are excluded from the theory and thus the mesons described by our equations can not decay physically .",
    "therefore any instability emerging from these equations will be unphysical , and a sign that the equations are describing unacceptable states .",
    "the dirac equation for a linear combination of a scalar and vector confining potential provides a familiar example of the kind of unphysical instabilities we are discussing .",
    "consider the dirac equation for the linear confining potential @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 and the vector strength @xmath6 are both constants .",
    "the solutions of this equation have both positive and negative binding energy eigenvalues @xmath7 .",
    "if the system described by this equation could interact with the outside world ( e.g. absorb or emit photons ) , the positive energy states could decay to negative energy states ( unless all of the negative energy states were occupied as in hole theory ) .",
    "however , we have assumed that there is no coupling to the outside world , and hence this equation should describe a stable system , even if some of the binding energy eigenvalues are infinitely large and negative .",
    "however , it is well known that the dirac equation does not give stable solutions for all values of the vector strength @xmath6 and we review this result now .",
    "the nature of the solutions to the dirac equation can be studied by looking at the expectation value of @xmath8 .",
    "the form of this expectation value , which describes how the wave function behaves , is @xmath9 where the positive energy expectation value is a matrix element involving @xmath10-type positive energy spinors , @xmath11 , and the negative energy expectation value is a matrix element involving @xmath12-type negative energy spinors , @xmath13 .",
    "the result ( [ intro2 ] ) comes from the matrix elements @xmath14 which hold when the total momentum @xmath15 . when eq .",
    "( [ intro2 ] ) is sketched for pure scalar ( @xmath16 ) or pure vector ( @xmath17 ) cases , fig .",
    "[ figc ] and fig .",
    "[ figd ] are produced , respectively .",
    "the resulting wave functions for a particle with energy @xmath18 are sketched on the figures , along with the form of @xmath19 which produces it .    to understand these results , first neglect the coupling between positive and negative energy states .",
    "then the positive energy states move under the influence of the potential @xmath20 and the negative energy states under the influence of @xmath21 . for the scalar case ( @xmath16 ) , the choice @xmath22 produces confinement for both positive and negative energy states .",
    "coupling the two solutions does not change this picture significantly , and the exact solution is a total wave function which drops to zero at large distances .",
    "this means that both positive and negative energy solutions describe particles permanently confined around the point @xmath23 .",
    "next look at the vector case ( @xmath17 ) , and begin again by neglecting the coupling between the positive and negative energy states . in this case , however , either the positive or negative energy state is always unconfined .",
    "for the example shown in fig .",
    "[ figd ] , @xmath22 and the positive energy states are confined and the negative energy states are not . including coupling between the positive and negative energy states mixes the two states , and the wave function for the exact positive energy solution acquires a component with a `` tail '' which oscillates to infinity , signaling deconfinement .",
    "the effect of the coupling is to produce an effective potential composed of two regions separated by a finite potential barrier through which the quark can tunnel .",
    "once it is free of the potential barrier it can propagate endlessly through space , thus becoming a free quark . in this case , the exact coupled solutions do not confine either the positive or negative energy states , and the bound state is unstable .",
    "this example , known as the klein paradox @xcite , is one of the unphysical instabilities we are trying to avoid .",
    "a relativisitic equation with a confining kernel with a given lorentz structure will have stable , physical solutions only if the following four conditions are satisfied :    \\(1 ) the binding energy must be real ;    \\(2 ) the energy eigenvalues must be independent of the numerical approximations used to obtain them ;    \\(3 ) unphysical solutions , if there are any , must be confined to an identifiable part of the spectrum clearly separated from the physical solutions ; and    \\(4 ) the solutions must have the correct structure in coordinate or momentum space .",
    "we will discuss each of these conditions in turn .",
    "_ condition _ 1 _  real energies_. any eigenstate wave function which describes a meson in momentum space , @xmath24 , can be written @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the discussion is simplified if the particle is chosen to be at rest , @xmath27 .",
    "then , if @xmath28 is complex , @xmath29 , the absolute square of the meson wave function is @xmath30 as time increases , this goes exponentially either to zero or to infinity , showing that the state is unstable .",
    "_ condition _ 2 _  numerical stability_. the different relativistic equations will be solved numerically in sec .",
    "iv using spline functions to model the wavefunctions in momentum space .",
    "( a description of the properties of the spline functions is given in appendix a. ) so long as enough spline functions are used to model the system , the energy of the lower lying stable states will not vary much as the spline rank is increased . however ,",
    "if the state is unstable it is part of a continuous spectrum and the energies obtained from the `` eigenvalue '' equation only represent a discrete approximation to this continuous spectrum .",
    "they will vary strongly with the number of splines , much as the location of the @xmath31th point in the interval @xmath32 $ ] will vary strongly with the number of intervals @xmath33 into which the the line segment is divided .",
    "this dependence of an energy level on spline rank is one of the most obvious symptoms of instability .",
    "_ condition _ 3 _  isolation of instabilities_. in some cases we find that , following the second criteria , the positive energy states are stable and the negative energy states are unstable .",
    "this may be acceptable for a phenomenology , where the negative energy states can be rejected as unphysical from the start .",
    "however , in some cases these unstable negative energy states become positive as the spline number increases , and they can become so positive that they cross the gap separating the negative and positive energy states , enter the positive energy spectrum , and mix with states which would otherwise be stable . in this case",
    "the distinction between ( stable ) positive energy states and ( unstable ) negative energy states becomes blurred , and we can not rely on the predictions of the equation .    _",
    "condition _ 4 _  correct structure_. even if the mass is real , the state might not be confined in a finite region of coordinate space ( as in the dirac example outlined above ) .",
    "if the state is confined , its coordinate space wave function will approach zero as @xmath34 _ faster than an exponential_. it can be shown that the momentum space wave function resulting from such a state will also fall off at @xmath35 faster than an exponential , and that the number of nodes will correspond to the level of the state .",
    "it is easy to distinguish such behavior from that of an unconfined state , which is neither localized in coordinate nor momentum space , and which has many nodes not related to the level of the state .",
    "we can use the dirac wave functions for comparison , since we know that they are stable for scalar confinement and unstable for vector confinement .",
    "examples of both types of states will be given in sec .",
    "iv .    in the following sections , these stability conditions",
    "will sometimes be referred to by number , as we will see that a successful phenomenology requires that all of them be satisfied .      in summary ,",
    "the stability conditions are : ( 1 ) the eigenvalues of the system must be real ; ( 2 ) the eigenvalues can not vary with the spline rank ; ( 3 ) the positive energy states must always be greater than any unstable negative energy states ; and ( 4 ) the wave functions must have the appropriate structure for that specific state .    in sec .",

    "then in sec .",

    "iv using spline functions for a quasirelativistic confining potential .",
    "the actual equations used in the computer code and the properties of spline functions are given in appendix a. finally , conclusions are given in sec .  v.",
    "in this section we define the one - channel spectator ( 1cs ) equation obtained by confining the heavier particle 1 ( assumed to be the quark ) to its positive energy mass shell , fixing the @xmath36 integration .",
    "then we show that these equations reduce to the dirac equation for the lighter particle ( particle 2 ) in the limit when the mass of the heaver particle @xmath37 .",
    "we conclude by finding a helicity representation for the 1cs and for the salpeter equation .",
    "the feynman diagram for the bound state meson vertex is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "particle 1 is the quark , particle 2 the antiquark , and @xmath38 is a matrix in dirac space which describes how the confining force couples to the quark or antiquark .",
    "it can be a scalar , @xmath39 , or the time component of a four - vector , @xmath40 .",
    "the kernel @xmath41 contains the momentum dependent structure of the confining potential .",
    "the equations are derived in the center of mass rest frame , @xmath42 .",
    "later , the quark will be placed on shell , thus producing the single channel equation .",
    "the four momenta used in the diagram are @xmath43 the vector @xmath44 is the average internal momentum and vector @xmath45 is the average external momentum of the quark - antiquark pair : @xmath46 with this notation , the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite for the bound state vertex function for the meson is @xmath47    the two fermion propagators have poles in the complex @xmath48 plane ; these four poles are shown fig .  [ fig16 ] .",
    "factoring the denominators of the propagators @xmath49 the poles are at @xmath50 to place particle 1 on the positive energy mass shell , the @xmath48 integration is closed in the lower half plane and only the residue from pole 1 is kept .",
    "this gives the following equation : @xmath51 where now @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this is one form of the one channel spectator equation .",
    "next , we recall that the projection operator can be written @xcite as a sum over on - shell @xmath10 spinors ( to be defined below ) @xmath54 therefore , if we define the relativistic meson wave function by @xmath55 then eq .",
    "( [ der10 ] ) becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57    equation ( [ der11a ] ) is the dirac form of the one - channel spectator equation .",
    "later we will reduce this equation further , but as written in ( [ der11a ] ) it looks very much like a dirac equation for the light _ antiparticle _ ( particle 2 ) moving under the influence of a effective potential which depends on the spin of the heavy quark . to make this comparison more familiar , we convert the equation into the usual form by taking the transpose and multiplying by the dirac charge conjugation matrix @xmath58 ( see ref .",

    "<S> mesons are made of quark - antiquark pairs held together by the strong force . </S>",
    "<S> the one channel spectator , dirac , and salpeter equations can each be used to model this pairing . </S>",
    "<S> we look at cases where the relativistic kernel of these equations corresponds to a time - like vector exchange , a scalar exchange , or a linear combination of the two . </S>",
    "<S> since the model used in this paper describes mesons which can not decay physically , the equations must describe stable states . we find that this requirement is not always satisfied , and give a complete discussion of the conditions under which the various equations give unphysical , unstable solutions . </S>"
