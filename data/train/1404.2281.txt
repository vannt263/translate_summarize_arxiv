    "major mergers between galaxies of comparable mass are expected to occur frequently in hierarchical models of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "galaxy merging may be a crucial process that regulates galaxy mass assembly , galaxy morphology reshaping , growth of supermassive black holes , and enhancement of star formation .",
    "measuring the galaxy merger rate over cosmic time is thus a central task in determining the importance of the merging process relative to that of other physical processes ( e.g. , feedback and gas accretion ) to driving galaxy evolution .",
    "much effort has been made to measure galaxy merger rate .",
    "interacting or merging galaxies are rare ( @xmath72% ) in the local universe , but they become more numerous at higher redshifts .",
    "however , the measurements of the merger rate are inconsistent with each other and are still under debate .",
    "while strong evolution characterized by @xmath8 was often reported @xcite , mild evolution following @xmath9 or even no evolution was obtained by other studies @xcite .",
    "the controversy is likely caused by large uncertainties in current observational techniques adopted for merger identification ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "disturbed morphology is mostly used as the probe of a merger .",
    "the violent tidal forces between merging galaxies can destroy galaxy structures and produce tidal features .",
    "for instance , extended tidal tails can be created when the mergers involve a disk galaxy @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the tidal tails in turn disclose key properties of the parent galaxies such as kinematics , mass ratio , and orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "a long tidal tail is usually seen as evidence for a merger between disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . resolving specific features from mergers helps to provide information on the frequency of mergers , a better understanding of the merger time scale , and a complete census of various types of mergers over cosmic time .",
    "it further delivers insights on evolutionary pathways for different galaxy populations .",
    "this will be possible with upcoming deep imaging surveys over large areas ( e.g. , euclid , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "computational approaches are keenly needed to detect the specific features tracing given types of mergers .",
    "non - parametric methods @xmath10 @xcite and gini-@xmath6 @xcite are widely used for merger selection .",
    "@xmath10 selects mergers mainly according to their morphological asymmetry , but fails to pick up those with weaker asymmetry in morphology ( e.g. , double - nucleus ) .",
    "the gini coefficient and @xmath6 parameters measure the relative distribution of pixel fluxes and spatial light concentration of a galaxy , respectively .",
    "mergers and regular galaxies are globally separated in the gini-@xmath6 space .",
    "this method favors to select mergers that are in their first pass or the final stage @xcite .",
    "neither @xmath10 nor gini-@xmath6 provides a complete selection for major mergers @xcite .",
    "this is in part because the parameters adopted in the two methods are flux weighted .",
    "these parameters are largely determined by the light distribution of the bright section of a galaxy , and are insensitive to the tidal features with lower surface brightness in the outskirts of the galaxy .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new approach to quantifying the structure of the outskirts of a galaxy , aimed at searching for tidal tails .",
    "two parameters are introduced to accomplish this . in section",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] we describe how to measure the two parameters . in section  [ sec : sec3 ] , we verify our method using a visually classified sample of galaxies .",

    "we divide the image of a galaxy into two sections split by the isophote which encloses half the total light of the galaxy .",
    "the inner section , named as the inner half - flux region ( ihr ) , usually encloses a smaller area with a higher surface brightness than the outer section , named as the outer half - flux region ( ohr ) . in practice ,",
    "the ihr is identified first , and the rest of the galaxy is presumed to occupy the ohr . if the galaxy is regular in morphology , the two sections can be simply separated by the isophote which contains half the total light . if a galaxy does not have a single , clear core , but has double or even multiple comparable components , then we fix the center at the brightest component , and find the half - light isophote around this point .",
    "we develop a technique to deal with image pixels and identify the brightest group of contiguous pixels as the brightest component in a galaxy image .",
    "the software tool sextractor is used to detect pixels that a galaxy covers in the background - subtracted image ( see section  [ sec : sec3.3 ] for details ) .",
    "these pixels are sorted in descending order of flux .",
    "the pixels with highest fluxes are selected , yielding @xmath15 , a ratio of the integrated flux to the total .",
    "more pixels within the galaxy will be included if a higher @xmath15 is set .",
    "starting from @xmath15=0.5 , the selected pixels may spread into two or more discrete groups of contiguous pixels for galaxies with complex light distribution ( e.g. , late - type spirals with giant clumps ) .",
    "these discrete groups of pixels are then individually examined to obtain their integrated fluxes . by increasing @xmath15 , each group",
    "is expected to contain more contiguous pixels and thus a higher fraction of the total flux .",
    "the brightest group with a sum of fluxes higher than 25% of the total is chosen to calculate a flux - weighted centroid .",
    "this position is taken as the center for isophotal fitting to the galaxy image . for a galaxy with smooth light distribution usually satisfying a srsic function ,",
    "the selected pixels make up one group , which is indeed the ihr when @xmath16 . for a merging system with two nuclei ,",
    "the brighter one will be selected .",
    "the factor of 25% is decided by this selection .",
    "with the center fixed , elliptical isophotes are fitted to the galaxy image . following the algorithms given in sextractor , the ellipticity and position angle of an isophote",
    "are determined by the maximum and minimum spatial dispersion of the enclosed pixels by the real isophote .",
    "the ellipse containing 50% of the total flux is taken as the boundary for the ihr . and",

    "the rotation center is determined iteratively in order to minimize the asymmetry .",
    "we define outer asymmetry , @xmath0 , as the asymmetry of the ohr of a galaxy following    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is flux distribution of the ohr and @xmath23 represents the @xmath24-rotated @xmath22 . in the same way",

    "the rotation center is critical to the estimation of the asymmetry parameter .",
    "for very nearby galaxies , a small shift for the center would cause a significant change in the estimated asymmetry .",
    "for distant galaxies , determining a rotation center becomes less complicated because of decreasing resolution @xcite .",
    "we thus adopt the centroid of the ohr as the rotation center when estimating @xmath0 .",
    "the centroid deviation parameter , @xmath1 , measures the deviation ( or offset ) between centroids of the ihr and ohr of a galaxy .",
    "the centroid is determined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 define the position of pixel @xmath30 in the galaxy image and @xmath31 is flux of the pixel .",

    "@xmath37 is estimated using @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is pixel count of the ihr .    for regular galaxies with symmetric morphologies , the ihr and ohr share nearly the same centroid , yielding a centroid deviation near zero . for merging galaxies with tidal tails",
    ", however , the centroid deviation becomes rather large , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "similarly , the merging galaxies tend to have higher @xmath0 than the regular galaxies .",
    "therefore , galaxies with asymmetric structures are expected to be away from the regular galaxies in the diagram of @xmath0 versus @xmath1 .",
    "we test this @xmath0-@xmath1 method using a sample of galaxies with high - resolution images from the hubble space telescope ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdfs ) is one of the cosmic fields with the deepest multi - wavelength data over an area of @xmath40 , including @xmath2/acs imaging data from the gems @xcite and the goods - s surveys @xcite , the survey catalog @xcite , photometry and photometric redshifts from the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( musyc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the stellar mass catalog from the combo-17 survey . the best - fit models of two - dimensional srsic profile derived from @xmath2 images are available for gems galaxies @xcite .",
    "we use these data to select a sample of galaxies and test our method for quantifying morphologies of the ohrs .",
    "we focus on massive galaxies that enable strong tidal features to be produced in the merging process and detectable at high-@xmath41 .",
    "we derive morphological parameters from @xmath2/acs images in the @xmath3 band , which corresponds to the rest - frame @xmath42 to @xmath43 in the redshift range @xmath5 . in total ,",
    "825 galaxies are selected with stellar mass @xmath44 and @xmath5 over the 800 square arcminutes area covered by @xmath2 observations .",
    "of them , 32 objects are too compact to be resolved in morphology ; and 29 objects are located at image edges .",
    "finally , 764 galaxies are selected to compose a mass - complete sample for our morphological investigation .",
    "the sample galaxies are mostly with @xmath3-band magnitude @xmath45 , compared to the 5@xmath46 depth of @xmath47mag .    the srsic index ( @xmath48 ) is often used as a morphology indicator ( e.g. , @xmath492.5 for disk galaxies ) .",
    "however , the two - dimensional structural fitting ignores irregular structures that are crucial to identifying galaxy mergers , although the srsic models are good proxies for regular galaxies .",
    "visual examination is still an efficient way to ascertain the tidal features .",
    "our @xmath0-@xmath1 method lacks sensitivity to distinguish galaxies with regular morphologies .",
    "we therefore adopt seven morphological types optimized for verifying the @xmath0-@xmath1 method , including spheroids ( e , s0 ) , early disks ( sa - b ) , late disks ( sc - d ) , edge - on disks , irregulars / minor mergers , major mergers without tidal tail , and major mergers with tidal tails .",
    "the morphological classification was independently carried out by all three co - authors . as a result",
    ", the 764 galaxies in our sample are classified into 440 , 57 , 57 , 27 , 108 , 60 and 15 from the first to the last class , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the latter three morphological classes , in particular major mergers with tidal tails .",
    "we note that tidal tails with a size of tens of kpcs at intermediate redshifts can be resolved with @xmath2/acs imaging .",
    "we explain in detail how to recognize a tidal feature as a tidal tail .",
    "the visual investigation by @xcite revealed that the host merging galaxies of tidal tails in ecdfs can be divided into four morphological types : diffuse , antennae , m51 and shrimp .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows @xmath2 images of merging galaxies with tidal tails selected from the ecdfs field .",
    "the diffuse - type galaxies refer to those with diffuse arc - like or tail - like intergalactic structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such tidal structures tend to have red color and smooth light profile , suggesting that they are tidal debris of early - type galaxies with little gas through dry mergers ( e.g. , the top - right panel in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the antennae - type galaxies have disturbed merger cores and extended tidal tails .",
    "they are most likely formed by major mergers between disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the visible timescale for tidal tails can be a few hundred myrs @xcite up to a few gyrs @xcite .",
    "about half the merging galaxies with tidal tails shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] are antennae - type ( e.g. i d 7357 , 44488 , 45115 , 57896 ) .",
    "tidal dwarf galaxies can be formed in these tails , being a result of local gravitational instabilities of the gas component or at the tip of a tidal tail regulated by the accumulation and collapse of massive gaseous condensations .",
    "the presence of long tidal tails or tidal dwarfs dramatically increases @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see section  [ sec : sec3.3 ] ) .",
    "the m51-type galaxies are mergers at their early stages and the stellar bridge connecting one galaxy to the another is still seen .",
    "the galaxies of this type are rare probably because of the short timescale to be detected . shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , 11072 is a pair of galaxies of comparable @xmath3-band luminosity .",
    "the system has just undergone its first pericenter passage with a weak tidal bridge .",
    "a tail - like structure is seen with color @xmath50 , similar to the color of the central components ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "no stellar clump is found on the tidal tail .",
    "finally , shrimp - type galaxies are characterized by a highly warped , dominant arm or tail and have no well - defined central nucleus .",
    "this type of merger is not included in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "using @xmath2 images , we calculate outer asymmetry @xmath0 and centroid deviation @xmath1 for our sample of 764 galaxies .",
    "we run sextractor to create a segmentation map for every galaxy .",
    "the segmentation map is an image with the same size as the scientific image where objects and their boundaries are determined .",
    "the total flux of a galaxy is then defined as the light contained in the pixels within its boundary .",
    "a detection threshold of 0.8@xmath52 above background is chosen . here",
    "@xmath52 is the @xmath53 of background noise .",
    "other configuration parameters are set following @xcite for the gems catalog .",
    "this threshold is lower than usual settings ( e.g. , 1.65@xmath52 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for source detection , aimed at finding extended tidal features that tend to have lower surface brightness at larger radii of the ohr of a galaxy .",
    "we point out that the total flux adopted here differs from that given , for example , in the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where missing flux is added in by extrapolation of integrated luminosity profiles to infinite radius .",
    "this procedure is impractical for our analysis since we are not fitting light profiles .",
    "the measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are nevertheless likely to be only marginally affected by this difference .",
    "we test the @xmath0-@xmath1 method for quantifying galaxy morphologies using our sample of 764 galaxies in comparison with the morphologies visually classified .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] illustrates the distribution of the sample in @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "different morphological types are marked with different symbols .",
    "we can see that all sample galaxies lie on a tight sequence , where the location is in general correlated with the degree of morphological disturbance .",
    "galaxies with stronger disturbed morphologies tend to have higher @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the vast majority of galaxies with regular morphologies ( e , s0 , sa - b , sc - d , edge - on disks ) have @xmath54 and @xmath55 , following a tight relation @xmath56 .",
    "this relation indicates that the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are correlated with each other .",
    "this is also confirmed by the fact that no data points are found in the bottom - right and top - left regions of the diagram .",
    "however , different morphological types of the sample galaxies are not clearly separated along the sequence . spheroids and early disks having symmetric morphologies",
    "reside mostly in the region @xmath57 .",
    "edge - on disks and late disks with non - symmetric substructures like arms , hii regions and stellar clusters are distributed more widely over the sequence .",
    "such substructures are unlikely to be responsible for a high @xmath1 .",
    "irregular galaxies and major / minor mergers are systematically higher in @xmath0 but spread over the full range of @xmath1 .",
    "the striking result from figure  [ fig : fig3 ] is that all galaxies with tidal tails ( black crosses ) have apparently higher @xmath1 and higher @xmath0 , compared with the galaxies of other morphological types , in particular regular ones ( spheroids and disks ) .",
    "the large spread in @xmath1 is mostly caused by the variety of the tidal tails in size and light weight relative to their host galaxies .",
    "the majority ( 12/15 ) of these with tidal tails are at @xmath58 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath1 is sensitive to the tidal tails , although three objects with weak tidal tails ( 17207 , 20158 , 24090 ) have @xmath54 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , the criterion @xmath59 is sufficient to select all galaxies with tidal tails and most major mergers ( 32/60 ) in our sample .",
    "this cut , however , also picks up a large fraction ( 43% ) of objects with irregular morphologies ( irregulars / minor mergers ) .",
    "we note that some regular galaxies ( spheroids and disks ) also fall into the @xmath58 region .",
    "we examined their images , and found that their @xmath0 and @xmath1 values are significantly affected by the unmasked residual light from neighboring sources .",
    "there are also 45 regular galaxies satisfying @xmath59 and @xmath54 .",
    "again , we visually checked their @xmath2 images and segmentation maps .",
    "of the 45 targets , 23 are contaminated by neighboring sources , and another 22 are isolated with asymmetric outskirts . again the two morphological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are largely overestimated for the visually - classified regular galaxies ( spheroids and disks ) due to the contamination .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows the 15 regular galaxies meeting the selection . we further investigate their morphological properties in detail for a better understanding of the selection .    * _ galaxy 49368 _ : it has bright stellar clumps of 1kpc size on one spiral arm , which seriously bias the estimation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "such features can be frequently seen in @xmath60 disk galaxies .",
    "minor mergers and instabilities in gas rich , turbulent disks are likely responsible for the formation of such clumps @xcite . * _ galaxies 1032 , 29488 , 35796 and 61789 _ : they are characterized by one prominent spiral arm .",
    "their morphologies are similar to the so - called shrimp - type galaxies defined by @xcite . the highly curved spiral arm together with star - forming clumps on it usually imply that they are gas - rich systems disturbed by minor mergers .",
    "however , no apparent signature is found for tidal disturbance in the four galaxies . * _ galaxies 2848 , 42774 and 42874 _ : they have multiple spiral arms and show strong asymmetry in morphology . * _ galaxies 20664 , 30167 , 30189 and 56918 _ : they are edge - on disk galaxies with a clear dust lane feature .",
    "the dust lane divides the light profile of the parent galaxy into two parts .",
    "in such cases , the system is treated as a double core system in our analysis .",
    "the centroid of the ihr would significantly deviate from the geometric center if the dust lane is thick and splits the galaxy into two non - equal parts . * _ galaxies 37335 and 59517 _ : they are classified as sd galaxies .",
    "their surface brightness is relatively low . and their @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are largely biased by clumpy light distribution and background noise . *",
    "_ galaxy 51329 _ : it is an edge - on disk galaxy . the disk is apparently warped .",
    "minor mergers / interactions are often proposed as the cause of warped disks .",
    "it is worth noting that the segmentation strategy used in our analysis relies on a low detection threshold .",
    "this may potentially mistake some noise pixels for part of the target , resulting in a fuzzy appearance at edges . since outer asymmetry and centroid deviation measure the morphological distribution of the ohr",
    ", the background noise may have noticeable effect on the estimate of the two parameters , in particular for low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "source deblending is also one issue that may affect the measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is also key to extracting source catalogs from deep images .",
    "we adopted the optimal configuration for sextractor from the gems catalog to produce segmentation maps for the selected sample galaxies .",
    "while the vast majority of sources can be properly resolved in the @xmath2 images with the configuration ( see @xcite for more details ) , a small fraction ( @xmath615% ) of sources may still be contaminated by foreground or background sources due to projection effects , or over deblended into multiple sources .",
    "merging galaxies with disturbed morphologies tend to suffer more from this problem . in this work , we visually examined the deblending for every sample galaxy and found a few cases with contamination by the neighboring sources which mislead the targets towards a high outer asymmetry .    ) and clumpiness ( @xmath62 ) for our sample .",
    "the solid line @xmath63 gives the relationship of nearby galaxies that are not involved in mergers while the dashed lines are the criteria ( @xmath64 ) for selecting merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "the data points are given in the same way as in figure  [ fig : fig3].,scaledwidth=45.5% ]",
    "the non - parametric methods @xmath10 and gini-@xmath6 are widely used automatic approaches in the literature to identify merging galaxies . in this section ,",
    "we compare our @xmath0-@xmath1 method with the @xmath10 and gini-@xmath6 methods in finding galaxies with extended tidal features .",
    "the @xmath10 method @xcite involves three morphological parameters : concentration ( @xmath65 ) , asymmetry ( @xmath19 ) and clumpiness ( or smoothness ; @xmath62 ) .",
    "the @xmath65 parameter describes the intensity of stellar light contained within the central region in comparison to a larger outer region of a galaxy .",
    "the @xmath19 quantifies the degree that the surface brightness profile of the galaxy deviates from a perfectly symmetric distribution .",
    "the @xmath62 parameter focuses on the flux that is contained in the clumpy part of the light distribution .",
    "we calculate @xmath19 and @xmath62 parameters for our sample galaxies using _ hst _ @xmath3-band images .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the solid line represents the @xmath66 relationship for regular galaxies in the local universe @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the star formation activities lead to an increase in both @xmath62 and @xmath19 for nearby galaxies .",
    "we find , however , that our sample galaxies at intermediate redshifts deviate from the relationship of nearby galaxies .",
    "this has also been reported and explained in @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a deviation is that both @xmath62 and @xmath19 decrease when the resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) become lower . and @xmath62 is affected by a larger degree than @xmath19 .    in @xmath10 ,",
    "a galaxy is identified as a major merger when @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this selection works well for those where morphological distortion affects more than 35% of the total light of the galaxy .",
    "the condition @xmath68 ensures that the asymmetric light is not dominated by clumpy star - forming regions .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows that only about one quarter ( 16/60 ) of the major mergers ( green diamonds ) and one third ( 5/15 ) of galaxies with tidal tails ( black crosses ) in our sample satisfy @xmath67 .",
    "this is not surprising , as @xmath67 statistically accounts for one third of the timescale for a major merger determined by n - body simulations , while minor mergers with mass ratio below @xmath69 hardly reach @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "this explains why only about one third of visually - classified major mergers and those with tidal tails in our sample are selected in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "we notice that some regular galaxies also show @xmath70 .",
    "it is mainly due to the contamination from neighboring sources within the target s 1.5 times petrosian radius .",
    "a high @xmath19 is obtained for galaxy 51329 due to the warped disk as shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "we emphasize that our @xmath0 parameter focuses on the morphological disturbance in the ohr of a galaxy in comparison with @xmath19 that is dominated by the central high s / n light distribution and less sensitive to morphological disturbance in the ohr .",
    "it is clear that galaxies with tidal tails become largely indistinguishable from disks and irregular galaxies in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "compared with figure  [ fig : fig3 ] , we can conclude that our @xmath0-@xmath1 method is more efficient than @xmath10 in selecting galaxies with strongly disturbed morphologies like tidal tails .     versus gini coefficient for our sample .",
    "the dashed line is the criterion ( @xmath71 ) from @xcite for selecting merging galaxies .",
    "all symbols are given as same as in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the majority of regular galaxies lie below the dashed line and form a well defined sequence.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      the gini coefficient ( @xmath72 ) was originally invented in economics and introduced to describe the light distribution of a galaxy through a lorentz curve @xcite .",
    "the gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 .",
    "a lower @xmath72 means a more uniform flux distribution within a galaxy while a higher @xmath72 means that a higher fraction of the total flux is contained in a smaller fraction of the galaxy pixels .",
    "@xmath6 is a parameter to measure the second - order moment of the light distribution of the top 20% brightest pixels in a galaxy which is then normalized to the light moment for all pixels . like parameter @xmath65",
    ", it describes the central concentration of the brightest pixels of the galaxy depending on their distance from the galaxy center .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig6 ] shows the distribution of our sample in the gini-@xmath6 diagram .",
    "we can see that our sample galaxies at intermediate redshifts are still distributed along a tight sequence following the nearby galaxies given in @xcite .",
    "the early - type galaxies have higher @xmath72 and lower @xmath6 ( top - right ) while late - type galaxies have lower @xmath72 and higher @xmath6 in a statistical sense .",
    "@xcite suggested to select major mergers by the criterion @xmath71 ( the dashed line in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "however , there are only 9 of 56 major mergers ( green diamonds ) and one of 15 galaxies with tidal tails ( black crosses ) located above the dashed line .",
    "it has been pointed out that that mergers identified by the gini-@xmath6 method are not complete ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simulations show that the gini-@xmath6 method primarily enables identifying mergers during the first pass or final stage when the galactic nuclei are distinguishable @xcite .",
    "the simulations also uncover that gini-@xmath6 is insensitive to mergers in the intermediate stage ( i.e. , maximal separation and/or second pass ) when tidal tails may be formed .",
    "comparison of figure  [ fig : fig6 ] with figure  [ fig : fig3 ] clearly demonstrates that our @xmath0-@xmath1 method is better than gini-@xmath6 in identifying major mergers and galaxies with apparent extended tidal features .",
    "two parameters , outer asymmetry and centroid deviation , are developed to quantify the structure in the ohrs of galaxies , which usually have lower surface brightness than their ihrs .",
    "the tidal features like tidal tails in the ohrs are signatures of major mergers .",
    "such delicate features are often extended and faint . detecting low surface brightness emission in the ohrs",
    "is thus critical to the measurements of the two parameters .",
    "we adopt a low threshold ( 0.8@xmath52 ) for source detection with sextractor in order to probe the extended faint structures around a target .",
    "this may mis - identify some surrounding noise pixels as part of the target , yielding a fuzzy appearance although the contribution to the total flux is negligible ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the effect of noise on the structural properties in the ohr would become significant for low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "such a detection technique based on surface brightness threshold has been widely used in studies of galaxy morphologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the physical size of detection of a given galaxy relies on the depth of the imaging and redshift due to the cosmological dimming effect .",
    "then the detection completeness of tidal features needs to be addressed for the evolution of a population of galaxies with dedicated features .",
    "@xcite adopted surface brightness threshold changing as @xmath73 to compensate for the cosmological dimming effect and ensure a constant surface brightness cut for all redshifts examined .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "alternatively , the elliptical or circular petrosian radius @xcite derived from the growth curve of a galaxy can be used to determine the segmentation map of the galaxy . taking the pixels within the petrosian radius as",
    "the segmentation map is able to correct the cosmological dimming effect @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this treatment may sacrifice the detection sensitivity of extended tidal features in the ohrs .",
    "for instance , the typical tidal tails of merging galaxies can be as extended as several tens of kpcs @xcite and beyond roughly 1@xmath71.5 times petrosian radius of the host galaxies .",
    "@xcite developed the so - called quasi - petrosian segmentation method and claimed that it enables the probe of extended low surface brightness structures and the correction for the cosmological dimming effect .",
    "firstly , all pixels of a galaxy in the sextractor preliminary segmentation map are sorted in decreasing order of flux .",
    "the method will select pixels from the highest end of flux to the lowest end until a pixel meets @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is flux of pixel @xmath30 , and @xmath76 is scale factor .",
    "@xmath77 is the cumulative mean surface brightness .",
    "however , the fuzzy sky pixels will still be included when @xmath76 is set lower for the detection of faint tidal tails .",
    "we develop a new automatic method to quantify the structure in the outskirts of galaxies , aiming at probing delicate features like tidal tails . using the isophote which encloses half the total light of a galaxy , the division of the galaxy image into two sections ( the ihr and ohr ) is the key to our method .",
    "two parameters are introduced in the method : @xmath0 , which measures the asymmetry of the ohr , and @xmath1 , which measures the deviation of the intensity weighted centroids of the ohr from that of the ihr relative to the effective radius .",
    "the galaxies with stronger disturbance in morphology are expected to have higher @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the two parameters are designed to be less affected by the central high surface brightness section of galaxies , and thus sensitive to low surface brightness features in the ohr . a sample of 764 galaxies with @xmath78 and @xmath5 selected from the gems and goods - s surveys",
    "is used to verify our method . for a comparison",
    ", we visually classify morphologies for the sample using @xmath2 @xmath3-band images , following the usual classification scheme given in the literature .",
    "the @xmath3 band corresponds to the rest - frame optical over the redshift range examined here .",
    "our investigation shows that all sample galaxies fall on a sequence in the @xmath0-@xmath1 space .",
    "the position along the sequence is in general correlated with the degree of morphological disturbance .",
    "galaxies with more disturbed morphologies have higher @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a statistical sense .",
    "the merging galaxies with tidal tails are well separated from regular galaxies ( spheroids and disks ) along the sequence .",
    "the regular galaxies are mostly with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , following a relation described by @xmath56 .",
    "the galaxies with tidal tails are mostly with @xmath790.5 and @xmath1 ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 .",
    "the criterion @xmath59 is able to select all galaxies with tidal tails and most major mergers ( without apparent tidal tails ) .",
    "the advantage of this selection is that major mergers with highly asymmetric morphologies are nearly complete and about 87% of galaxies with regular morphologies ( spheroids and disks ) are excluded at the same time .",
    "the left 13% of regular galaxies tend to have higher @xmath0 and @xmath1 contributed by odd spiral arms , strong dust lanes , warped disks , or contamination from neighboring sources .",
    "low surface brightness galaxies suffer more from the contamination by surrounding sources or background noise , leaving @xmath0 and @xmath1 highly uncertain .",
    "given that nearly 63% of the major mergers ( including those with tidal tails ) can be selected by a single cut in the @xmath0-@xmath1 space , out method can be used for a relatively complete search for major mergers from large scale imaging surveys .    compared with @xmath10 and gini-@xmath6 ,",
    "our @xmath0-@xmath1 method is able to provide a better separation between mergers and regular galaxies .",
    "in particular , our method is unique in probing extended delicate features . in gini-@xmath6 ,",
    "galaxies with tidal tails mix together with regular galaxies . and @xmath10 is also insensitive to galaxies of this kind .",
    "we point out that our @xmath0 is in a better position than @xmath19 in @xmath10 for probing asymmetric structures of galaxies .",
    "next - generation deep imaging surveys carried out by the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) and euclid will provide high - quality multi - band imaging data over large areas of sky , allowing for detailed studies of the structure and morphology of galaxies to address how galaxies form and evolve .",
    "automatic approaches like our @xmath0-@xmath1 method for morphological analysis are essential in the era of big data .",
