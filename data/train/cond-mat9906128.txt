    "in quantum mechanics the hamiltonian @xmath2 alone does not determine energy eigenstates of the system .",
    "we need information on the wavefunction @xmath3 which includes the boundary condition in general and for the case of a many - electron system , antisymmetry due to the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "the antisymmetry may be regarded as addition of the phase factor @xmath4 to @xmath3 in the interchange of any pair of electrons of the same spin .",
    "note that this factor @xmath4 brings about an important concept of `` the exchange interaction '' @xmath5 which is just the energy difference between singlet ( @xmath6 ) and triplet ( @xmath7 ) states in an interacting two - electron system .",
    "addition of the phase factor to @xmath3 also occurs in the course of berry - phase connection ; the berry phase is a geometric phase in @xmath3 acquired by parallel transport.@xcite on the analogy of @xmath5 , we propose a new concept of `` the geometric energy '' by considering an energy difference between the states characterized by different winding numbers @xmath8 ( the chern integers ) associated with the topological invariant in parallel transport .    in order to substantiate the above proposal",
    ", we calculate the geometric energy in this paper in the simplest possible system , namely , a system consisting of a single electron moving back and forth between two jahn - teller(jt ) centers . in sec .",

    "consider an @xmath0 electron in the system composed of two mn@xmath13o@xmath1 octahedra with one oxygen ion common to both octahedra to provide a transfer path with @xmath14 the transfer integral for the @xmath0 electron in @xmath15-direction .",
    "we assume that the spins of @xmath16 electrons are aligned in one direction . because of the strong hund s rule coupling , spin of the @xmath0 electron also aligns in the same direction . in this sense , there are no spin degrees of freedom and we may write @xmath2 in second quantization as @xmath17\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the pauli matrices , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , creation operators for electrons in @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbitals at mn site @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are dimensionless vibrational variables representing , respectively , @xmath28 and @xmath29 modes around site @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the static jt energy . since we shall treat static distortions in the adiabatic approximation , the kinetic - energy term of ions is not considered in @xmath2 .",
    "the berry - phase effect at site @xmath30 is best included by writing vibrational modes in polar coordinates as @xmath32 and @xmath33 . using @xmath34 , we transform the operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 into @xmath37 and @xmath38 as @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] . in this representation , the second term ( the site - energy term ) in ( [ eq : h ] ) is diagonalized .",
    "the molecular aharonov - bohm effect manifests itself in the phase factor @xmath41 at each site @xmath30 at which topology of the singularity is understood as a double - plane feature .",
    "the transfer between the two sites connects @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "we make this connection by parallel transport , by which we mean that if we start with a state representing an electron at site 1 , @xmath44 , we make the state evolve from @xmath44 in the direction orthogonal to it , namely , along the direction of a state representing an electron at site 2 , @xmath45 .",
    "this parallel transport indicates that an @xmath0 electron picks up only a constant phase @xmath46 by a trip from site 1 to site 2 , namely , @xmath47 . a further trip in the same direction from site 2 results in the total phase as @xmath48 .",
    "now in general , a two - site system is equivalent to a corresponding periodic lattice system with periodicity two .",
    "thus the phase @xmath49 should represent the same physics at site 1 at which the phase is @xmath42 .",
    "this reasoning leads us to the conclusion that @xmath50 should be equal to @xmath51 with an integer @xmath8 .",
    "if we make a more general argument on topology,@xcite it turns out that @xmath8 is nothing but the winding number , a topologically conserved quantity which is useful to specify an eigenstate of the system . note that @xmath8 describes a geometric structure as to how the double - plane structure at each site is interconnected",
    "let us calculate the lowest single - electron energy for each @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "we adopt a variational procedure by considering a wavefunction @xmath54 as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are real numbers , @xmath58 is the vacuum for electron operators , and @xmath59 is the phonon wavefunction representing the @xmath60-function - like distribution of @xmath61 around @xmath62 .",
    "we have optimized all the parameters involved in the problem except for @xmath63 ( which is related to @xmath64 through @xmath65 ) in order to make @xmath66 minimum under the condition of @xmath67 for given @xmath14 and @xmath31 .",
    "we have found that the lowest energy is obtained at @xmath68 irrespective of @xmath8 .",
    "this is the condition for the @xmath0-electron orbital to polarize in the transfer direction .",
    "( if we start with a different configuration , say two sites in @xmath69-direction , we obtain completely the same physical results with the interchange of the role of @xmath15-axis with that of @xmath69 . )",
    "however , @xmath54 is different for different @xmath8 in an interesting way . for @xmath70",
    ", we obtain @xmath71 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "as long as @xmath31 is smaller than @xmath14 , symmetry exists between the sites , but for larger @xmath31 the site - symmetry is broken ; an @xmath0 electron tends to localize in site 1 .",
    "( of course , the state with the interchange of the sites is possible , but there is no overlap between these two states because of the orthogonality of phonon wavefunctions . )    for @xmath72 , on the other hand , we obtain @xmath73 and @xmath74 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . in this case , the site - symmetry is broken even for an infinitesimally small positive value for @xmath31 due to the fact that the lattice at site 2 never deforms , because with this winding number , an @xmath0 electron at site 1 in the lower adiabatic potential plane is parallel - transported to the upper adiabatic potential plane at site 2 . in this sense",
    ", @xmath72 describes `` the inter - potential - plane connection '' , while @xmath70 `` the intra - potential - plane connection '' .",
    "we plot the corresponding energies @xmath53 as a function of @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in which we give an analytic expression for @xmath75 .",
    "( we can give @xmath76 only numerically . ) the term @xmath77 clearly indicates the hopping nature of an electron localized by the jt stabilization energy @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "we find that @xmath75 is always lower than @xmath76 .",
    "the geometric energy , @xmath80 , is negligibly small in both large- and small-@xmath31 regions , but it becomes as large as @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "quite a similar situation occurs in the @xmath5-problem in a two - electron system in which the conserved quantity is the total spin @xmath83 ; the energy of the singlet state @xmath84 is always lower than that of the triplet one @xmath85 .",
    "note , however , that application of external magnetic fields can compensate the energy difference to stabilize the triplet state .",
    "analogously , we may stabilize @xmath86 by compensating the geometric energy with application of external stresses to the system in @xmath15-direction , because the state @xmath86 is less distorted in the direction than @xmath87 .",
    "considerable accumulation of experimental data has been made as for the crystal structures of the insulating la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "everyone agrees the existence of the charge and orbital ordering in these compounds , but a controversy continues about their detailed crystallographic superstructures ; some claim the `` paired - stripe '' model@xcite and others the `` wigner - crystal '' model.@xcite    in order to shed light on the argument , we have extended our calculation from the two - jt - center problem to a two - dimensional lattice system.@xcite the key idea is to identify a zigzag conducting path of @xmath0 electrons along which we define the winding number @xmath8 .",
    "we have found that the state corresponding to the wigner - crystal model provides the lower energy than the paired - stripe state , though the energy difference is quite small .",
    "this result is obtained without any consideration of the long - range coulomb interaction @xmath88 .",
    "we have included the effect of @xmath88 recently and found that further stabilization is obtained for the wigner - crystal state over the paired - stripe one .",
    "thus , in terms of energies , it seems to be certain that the former state is favorable .",
    "however , we have investigated the electronic state of @xmath0 electrons in the observed paired - stripe structure , evaluated the corresponding winding number @xmath8 , and found an interesting relation between @xmath8 and the @xmath0-electron density specified by @xmath69 as@xcite @xmath89 since @xmath8 is an integer , some specific values exist for @xmath90 $ ] such as @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , etc .",
    "this reminds us of the experimentally observed special values of @xmath69 and the related lever rule.@xcite thus , if the crystal is placed in an `` environment '' to favor the state with this winding number @xmath8 , we can expect that the paired - stripe state may be observed . at present , we do not know precisely how we can define the `` environment '' and this may be an important issue in the future not only from a viewpoint to clarify the crystal structures of la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath11 but also from a fundamental aspect as to the identification of a physical variable to control the winding number or the geometric energy ."
