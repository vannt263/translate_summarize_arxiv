    "spherically symmetric metrics in multidimensional ( md ) gravity can describe black holes and wormholes ( wh ) ( see for , example , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "usually these papers investigate metrics without off - diagonal components .",
    "however these components of the md metric can play an important role as a result of the following theorem @xcite-@xcite :    let @xmath3 be the group fibre of the principal bundle .",

    "this theorem suggests that including the off - diagonal components of the md metric is equivalent to including gauge fields ( u(1 ) , su(2 ) or su(3 ) gauge fields ) , and a scalar field @xmath9 which is connected with the linear size of the extra dimension .",

    "these solutions are spherically symmetric wh - like metrics with finite longitudinal size .",
    "the throat of these wh - like solutions is located between two surfaces where the reduction from 5d to 4d spacetime breaks down .",
    "these results indicate that the exotic matter necessary for the formation of the wh can appear in * _ vacuum multidimensional gravity _ * from the off - diagonal elements of the metric ( the gauge fields ) and from the @xmath0 component of the metric ( the scalar field ) , rather than coming from some externally given exotic matter .",

    "the splitting off or compactification of the extra dimensions is taken to occur at the surfaces where the two 4d reissner - nordstrom solutions are connected to the 5d wh throat .",
    "this composite , asymptotically flat wh has regions with both compactified extra dimensions ( the two exterior regions of the 4d reissner - nordstrom solutions ) and with noncompactified extra dimensions ( the 5d throat or bridge which connects the two 4d solutions ) .",

    "the sources of these kaluza - klein fields ( 5d `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' charges ) are located at @xmath97 .",
    "this feature leads us to consider this solution as a kind of 5d `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' dipole .",

    "the longitudinal length of the solution goes to @xmath18 and the cross - sectional size becomes a constant .",
    "the result of a numerical calculations is presented in fig.4 where we have taken @xmath114 so that @xmath115 . in this case",
    "the `` electrical '' field is taken as decreasing from the @xmath116 case down to @xmath117 . as the `` magnetic '' field strength increases relative to the `` electric '' field strength we notice the following evolution of the solution : the infinite flux tube of the equal field case turns into a finite flux tube when @xmath118 drops below @xmath119 .",
    "also the cross - sectional size of this case has a maximum at @xmath120 and decreases as @xmath89 where singularities occur .",

    "the longitudinal size of this flux tube ( the distance between charges ) reaches its minimum in the limit when there is only a `` magnetic '' field ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "as the relative strengths of the kaluza - klein fields are varied we find that the solutions to the metric in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) evolve in a very interesting and suggestive way . starting with the case when there is no `` magnetic '' field this evolution can be sketched as follows :    1 .",
    "the solution is * _ a wh - like object _ * located between two surfaces at @xmath62 where the reduction of 5d to 4d spacetime breaks down .",
    "the cross - sectional size of this solution increases as @xmath21 goes from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",

    "the longitudinal distance between the @xmath62 surfaces increases , and the cross - sectional size does not increase as rapidly as @xmath122 , compared to the previous case .",
    "3 .   @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the solution is * _ an infinite flux tube _ * filled with constant `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' fields , and with the charges disposed at @xmath97 .",
    "the cross - sectional size of this solution is constant ( @xmath123 ) . essentially , as the magnetic field strength",
    "is increased one can think that the two previous solutions are stretched so that the @xmath62 surfaces are taken to @xmath97 and the cross section becomes constant .",
    "4 .   @xmath124 . in this case",
    "we have * _ a finite flux tube _ * located between two ( + ) and ( - ) `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' charges located at @xmath62 .",
    "thus the longitudinal size of this object is again finite , but now the cross sectional size decrases as @xmath122 . at @xmath125",
    "this solution has real singularities which we interpret as the locations of the charges .",
    "this solution is very similar to the confinement mechanism in qcd where two quarks are disposed at the ends of a flux tube with color electrical and magnetic fields running between the quarks . in this connection",
    "one can ask if this similarity is accidental or if there is some deeper connection between 5d kaluza - klein gravity and qcd ?",
    "we note that in ref .",
    "@xcite some mappings between 4d gravity and non - abelian theory are discussed .",
    "this solution is again * _ a finite flux tube _ * only with `` magnetic '' field filling the flux tube . in this solution",
    "the two opposite `` magnetic '' charges are confined to a spacetime of fixed volume .",
    "this may indicate why single , asymptotic magnetic charges have never been observed in nature : they are permanently confined into monopole - antimonopole pairs of some fixed volume .",
    "the evolution of the solution from a wh - like object , to an infinite flux tube , to a finite flux tube , as the relative strengths of the fields is varied , is presented in fig.5 .",
    "this allow us to make two complimentary conclusions : first , if one takes some wheeler - like model of electric charge as in ref .",
    "@xcite then it can be seen that if the magnetic field becomes too strong the wh - like solution is destroyed and with it the wheeler - like model of electric charge .",
    "second , if one concentrates a sufficently strong electric field ( _ i.e. _ @xmath98 ) into some small region of spacetime one is led to the science fiction - like possibility that one may be able _ * to `` open '' the finite flux tubes into a wh - like configuration*_. this conjecture assumes some kind of spacetime foam model where the vacuum is populated by virtual flux tubes filled with virtual `` magnetic '' and/or `` electric '' fields .    starting from the solutions obtained here we see that in 5d gravity there is a distinction between `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' kaluza - klein fields .",
    "this can be contrasted with the 4d electrogravity reissner - nordstrm solution which is the same for the electrical and magnetic charges .",
