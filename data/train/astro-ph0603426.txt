    "with an isotropic equivalent energy release on the order of @xmath10 ergs , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are among the most energetic events in the universe besides the big bang .",
    "grbs can be separated into two classes : short and long bursts .",
    "long bursts , with durations longer than 2 seconds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are associated with the collapse of a very massive star and the formation of a black hole @xcite .",
    "short bursts are thought to be the result of a neutron star ( ns ) - ns or ns - black hole merger ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the leading theoretical model for grbs and their afterglows is the fireball model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) in which the grb is produced by internal shocks in a relativistic fireball , while the afterglow is produced in external shocks which are created when the fireball encounters the ambient external medium .",
    "the multi - wavelength mission _ swift _",
    "@xcite was launched on 2004-november-20 in order to hunt for grbs .",
    "it is in low - earth orbit at an altitude of 600 kms .",
    "the  observatory is equipped with three telescopes : a ) the burst alert telescope ( bat , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , b ) the x - ray telescope ( xrt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and c ) the uv - optical telescope ( uvot , * ? ? ?",
    "the bat is a coded mask experiment and operates in the 15 - 350 kev energy range .",
    "the xrt detector is a copy of the mos ccds used on - board xmm @xcite .",
    "it operates between 0.3 - 10 kev in three observing modes , photon counting ( pc ) which is equivalent to the full - frame mode on xmm , windowed timing ( wt ) , and low - rate photo - diode mode ( lrpd ) which is only used for extremely bright sources @xcite .",
    "the uvot is a sister instrument to xmm s optical monitor ( om , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and includes a similar set of filters to the om @xcite .    as reported by @xcite ,  has observed a general behavior of grb afterglow x - ray light curves : a fast decay with slope @xmath11 in the first hundred seconds is followed by a much shallower decay slope @xmath12 .",
    "this continues over a span of several thousands of seconds after the burst and is followed by a steeper decay slope @xmath13 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the mean decay slopes of the 27 afterglows discussed in @xcite are : @xmath11=3.38@xmath71.27 , @xmath12=0.76@xmath70.34 , and @xmath13=1.33@xmath70.32 .",
    "in this paper we report the  observations of grb050603 .",

    "the narrow - field instruments , uvot and xrt , were unable to observe the grb afterglow until about 9.5 and 11 hours after the burst , respectively .",
    "the uvot began observing at 15:42:59 ut @xcite .",
    "the observations were made in the v filter with exposure time ratios of 1:8:1 per observing window so that the entire observation is not ruined if there is high background from the earth limb at the beginning or end of the observation .",
    "only the middle exposures were used , to eliminate the problems of high background . the nasa  data center ( sdc)-processed sky images were astrometrically aligned with respect to an image of the field from the digitized sky survey .",
    "aperture photometry was performed using a 6@xmath23 source aperture and a background annulus with inner and outer radii of 14@xmath23 and 30@xmath23 respectively .",
    "once the afterglow in individual observations had fallen below 3@xmath22 above background they were co - added to bring the s / n ratio above a 3@xmath22 detection .    the grb050603 observations by the uvot also revealed an infrequent problem in which the images do not contain events from the whole exposure time indicated in the header .",
    "extension 4 of sequence 00131560001 reported an exposure time of 1500s .",
    "however , a comparison of the count rate measured by the instrument and the counts in the image indicated that the image contained only 110 seconds of data .",
    "thus only 7.3% of the data were actually recorded .",

    "the spectrum is background subtracted .",
    "it has the standard 80-channel bat energy binning .",
    "grb050603 had @xmath0=12@xmath72s which classifies it as a long burst .",

    "based on the redshift z=2.812 @xcite , the k - corrected rest - frame 100500  kev and 20  kev2  mev total isotropic equivalent energies @xmath30=3.2@xmath31 ergs and @xmath30=1.26@xmath32 ergs , respectively , are some of the largest measured among all grbs detected by   @xcite .",

    "the decay slope , derived from the 0.3 - 10.0 kev flux light curve shown in figure  [ 050603_lc ] , is unusually steep with @xmath35 .",
    "this makes grb050603 a relatively rapidly fading afterglow in its late phase @xcite .",
    "the data are consistent with one simple power law throughout the observation with a @xmath28=14.3/17 .    just before the detection of grb050603 the xrt mos ccd was hit by a micro - meteorite which caused severe damage to columns 294 and 320 .",
    "these columns ( and several adjacent ones ) have been disabled on - board and are not useable .",
    "if the psf of a source overlaps these bad columns , the measured flux can be incorrect . since the source position on the detector changes with each orbit",
    ", this can lead to errors in the light curve .",
    "we have verified that the grb was not positioned on the bad columns during this observation .",
    "table  [ spectral ] lists the results of the spectral analysis of the xrt data .",
    "a simple power law model with galactic absorption fits the spectra well for the segments 001 and 002 ( table[obs_log ] ) data , resulting in x - ray energy spectral slopes @xmath36=0.80@xmath70.17 and 0.62@xmath70.13 for segments 001 and 002 , respectively .",
    "the simultaneous fit to the segment 001 and 002 data is shown in figure  [ 050603_spec ] .",
    "the energy ranges of the two spectra are different due to the s / n and teh binning of the channels using _ grppha_. this fits results in an x - ray spectra slope @xmath36=0.71@xmath70.10 . in all cases , no additional intrinsic absorption is required . leaving the absorption column density as a free parameter results in an absorption column density which is significantly below the galactic value .",
    "as shown in figure  [ 050603_spec ] there are some apparent residuals around 0.5 and 2.0 kev .",
    "these features are due to systematic errors in the still ongoing calibration of the auxiliary response file ( see the xrt calibration document xrt - oab - cal - arf - v3 and * ? ? ?",
    "the v magnitudes for grb050603 are listed in table 4 and the v - band light curve is shown in figure  [ 050603_lc_xrt_uvot ] .",
    "the first measurement , v=18.2 at 9.5 hours after the burst , is brighter than any other optical  afterglow at the same time , many of which are not optically detected at all ( see e.g. roming et al .",
    "2005b ) , and is among the brightest of all optical afterglows with the exception of grb030329 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray and optical decay slopes are similar , with the uvot points decaying with a power law slope of 1.8@xmath70.2 with @xmath28=18/7 .",
    "there is no indication of a break near 12 hours as suggested by berger & becker ( 2005 ) , though the errors and wide temporal sampling do not allow a definitive statement .",
    "the steepness of the decay indicates that the break may have already occurred before our observations began , which would put a putative break at less than t+9 hours post - burst .",
    "the large value of @xmath28 indicates that the deviations from the simple power law may be real , though the largest deviations are only 2 @xmath22 .",
    "( 2006 ) , in an independent analysis of the uvot data , also concluded that this afterglow exhibited real fluctuations from a powerlaw decay .",
    "the power law decay reported by li et al .",

    "grb050603 was also detected by the ibis instrument on board integral in the 40 - 300 kev energy range @xcite . however , because the burst was outside the field of view it could not be localized .",
    "the duration of the burst seen by ibis agreed with the results from the bat .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of grb050603 by konus - wind in the observed 20kev-3mev range .",

    "grb050603 was a particularly bright and energetic burst .",
    "the 15 - 150 kev fluence of 7.6@xmath41 ergs @xmath2 places it among the top 10% of  bursts .",
    "the isotropic energy of 1.26@xmath32 ergs makes it one of the most energetic bursts ever detected .",
    "combined with the rest - frame @xmath40=1.3 mev , grb050603 is consistent with the amati relation @xcite .    with an optical magnitude of v=18.2",
    "9.5 hours after the burst it was also the brightest optical afterglow seen so far by  at this late time after the burst .",
    "the only burst that had a comparable magnitude ( v=18.9 ) at 10 hours after the burst was grb050525 @xcite .",
    "all other bursts were far below this magnitude at this time after the burst . in x - rays , however , the afterglow of grb050603 was not the brightest one among other  bursts observed at similar times after the trigger .",
    "the x - ray afterglow of grb050603 decayed with a rather steep slope of @xmath4=1.76@xmath70.07 , compared with the mean decay slope of @xmath42 for 27 bursts listed in @xcite .",
    "this is intermediate between the slopes of @xmath43 obtained from chandra grating observations , xmm observations , and beppo - sax afterglows discussed in @xcite , but is somewhat shallower than the mean decay slope of @xmath44=2.0@xmath70.3 from their survey of chandra imaging afterglow observations .",
    "it is also intermediate between the expectations for the `` normal '' afterglow slope following the end of energy injection by the central engine , and the steeper slope expected following the end of energy injection by the central engine .",
    "we note , however , that the decay slope in the v - band filter ( @xmath45 ) is consistent with the x - ray decay slope , consistent with the typical signature of an afterglow after the jet break @xcite .",
    "this suggests the possibility that grb050603 had an early jet break before 2.9 hours ( rest - frame ) after the burst .",
    "if we assume that the jet break happened before the start of the uvot and xrt observations , we can use the dependence of jet angle on break time @xcite to place a limit on the jet opening angle of @xmath46 , where we have used @xmath47 ergs and we assumed the density of the circum - burst matter is 0.1 @xmath48 .",
    "we note that @xcite argue for a larger typical circum - burst density of 10 @xmath48 , which would imply a slightly larger jet angle limit of 23 .    in order to check the jet interpretation , we compare the observed @xmath44=@xmath49 and @xmath36=0.71@xmath70.10 to the prediction of the jet model . for the familiar case of @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 is the electron spectral index ) , one requires that @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) or @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , where @xmath56 is the typical synchrotron frequency ( injection frequency ) and @xmath57 is the cooling frequency @xcite . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath58 .",
    "both cases are inconsistent with the data at the @xmath59 level .",
    "we therefore consider the case of @xmath60 @xcite . for @xmath53 ,",
    "this case has @xmath61 , while the data have @xmath62 , in good agreement with theory . in this regime",
    "the electron index is @xmath63 .",
    "this case also has @xmath64 as long as the self - absorption frequency is below the optical band , in agreement with the observations . in this case",
    ", we expect @xmath65 if the optical band is above the cooling frequency , or @xmath66 if the optical band is between the injection frequency and the cooling frequency ; however , with only v - band data we can not constrain @xmath67 directly .",
    "the observed spectral index between the x - ray and optical bands is @xmath68)]=0.04 .",
    "these spectral slopes suggest that there is a break in the spectrum between the optical and x - rays suggesting that the optical band is between the injection and cooling frequencies .",
    "we therefore conclude that the jet interpretation fits these data provided there is a flat electron energy spectrum @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "we note however , that this interpretation is at odds with the expectations from @xcite who find the relation @xmath70 , which predicts a jet break in the optical light curve at 1 day after the burst in the rest - frame , or 3.8 days in the observed frame .",
