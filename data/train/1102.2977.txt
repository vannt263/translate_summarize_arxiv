    "in fig .  [ fg : kondotat450mvand10 t ] it is shown that , as expected for a single atom transistor @xcite , an odd / even effect in the magneto - transport spectroscopy data is observed .",
    "this consists of the zeeman down shift of the first electron resonance ( @xmath20 ) and the zeeman up shift of the second electron resonance ( @xmath22 ) @xcite .",
    "the doubling of the @xmath10 peak is a feature sometimes observed in a single dopant system and can be associated with the presence of a nearby defect quickly switching its charge state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these results , together with the charging energy of 30 - 35 mv between the @xmath20 and the @xmath22 state in this sample ( fig .",
    "[ fg : dh64chipc2t300mkstabcondbis ] ( a ) of the main text ) and the identification of the excited states as in ref .",

    "[ fg : fig2supp ] , the evolution with temperature of the central resonance for @xmath16 = 0 t and @xmath45 = @xmath46 @xmath47 ( centred at @xmath2 = @xmath48 @xmath47 ) and the evolution in temperature for both the @xmath16 = 0 t and @xmath16 = 10 t peaks are shown .",
    "a value of @xmath35 = 6 k is obtained for the @xmath16 = 10 t case , which is higher if compared to su(2 ) spin kondo temperatures observed for quantum dots ( typically @xmath49 1k ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the point for @xmath16 = 0 t and @xmath19 = 4.2 k is considerably lower if compared to the values in the 0.3 k-1.6 k range .",
    "the peak saturation observed for @xmath49 1k in the @xmath16 = 0 t case , strongly supports the conclusion that , at @xmath19 @xmath43 300 mk , our system is indeed in the zero temperature limit .",
    "a single dopant in a finfet can be described as a quantum dot ( qd ) : the single electron state corresponds to the neutral donor @xmath20 while the two - electron state corresponds to a negatively charged donor @xmath22 .",
    "consider then a qd with two ( nearly ) degenerate localised orbitals ( valleys ) coupled to reservoirs .",
    "hereafter we will denote this orbital quantum number by @xmath50 .",
    "the dot is then described by the hamiltonian      where @xmath52 is the single - particle energy level of the localized state with orbital @xmath13 and spin @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator of the state , @xmath56 the occupation , @xmath57 ( @xmath50 ) the intra - orbital coulomb interaction , and @xmath58 the inter - orbital coulomb interaction .",
    "the effect of the external magnetic field is to lift the spin degeneracy of the single - particle energy levels .",
    "the resulting splitting is denoted @xmath59 so that the single - particle energy levels @xmath52 have the form @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , as we argue in the main text , the valley ( orbital ) states are s - like @xcite and are therefore not affected by the magnetic field .",
    "the precise values of the coulomb interactions @xmath61 depend on the details of the system , but should be of the order of the charging energy @xmath62 mev  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the regime where the system of the localized levels is occupied by a single electron ( @xmath63 , quarter filling ) , and the charging energy is much bigger than other energy scales * ( i.e .",
    "@xmath64)*. in this regime the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ su4vs2::eq : hd ] ) suffices to describe all relevant physics .",
    "kondo physics arises as a result of the interplay between the strong correlation in the dot and the coupling of the localized electrons with the itinerant electrons in conduction bands . in our case , these are described as two leads ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) which are treated as non - interacting gases of fermions      when the leads have the same symmetry as the dot , the orbital quantum number @xmath13 in the leads is identical to the orbital quantum number in the dot and will be preserved over the tunnelling of electrons from the dot to the leads and vice versa .",
    "this is what we expect to have in our system with heavily doped si as source and drain and a quantum dot that results from the hybridisation of the donor hydrogen - like state with the quantum well state formed in the si channel  @xcite .",
    "this situation is described by the tunnelling hamiltonian                  the total hamiltonian is then given by @xmath69 .",
    "for simplicity , we ignore the @xmath70- and @xmath53-dependence of the tunneling amplitudes .",
    "therefore , we consider a simplified model with @xmath71 which defines the widths @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the density of states in the reservoirs .",
    "now we write the physical fermionic operator as a combination of a pseudo - fermion and a boson operator as follows : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the pseudo - fermion which annihilates one  occupied state  in the @xmath13th localised orbital with spin @xmath53 , and @xmath76 is a boson operator which creates an  empty state  .",
    "quite generally the intra(inter ) coulomb interaction is very large and we can safely take the limit of @xmath64 .",
    "this fact enforces the constraint            our next task is to solve this hamiltonian , which is rather complicated due to the presence of the three operators in the tunnelling part and the constrain . in order to do this",
    "we employ the so - called non - crossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite . without entering into much detail of the theory , we just mention that the boson fields in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) are treated as fluctuating operators such that both thermal and charge fluctuations are included in a self - consistent manner . in particular , one has to derive self - consistent equations - of - motion for the time - ordered double - time green s function ( sub - indexes are omitted here ) :               baym @xcite , and has been related to other non - equilibrium methods ( like the keldysh method ) by langreth , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . here",
    ", we just show numerical results of the nca equations for our problem and refer the interested reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "in particular , the density of states is given by          with @xmath87 the fourier transform of @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath89 the fermi - dirac function at each reservoir held at a chemical potential @xmath90 such that the applied bias voltage is defined as @xmath91 .      in the following , we present results for the density of states and the differential conductance @xmath92 .",
    "[ fig : dosv0 ] shows the density of states ( dos ) for * zero bias * for symmetric and asymmetric couplings to the reservoirs . for @xmath93 ( zero zeeman splitting ) , the peak on",
    "the dos is away from zero frequency while for a finite zeeman splitting @xmath94 the central resonance [ due to the orbital degree of freedom ] shifts to @xmath95 ( shown in the figure for @xmath96 ) .",
    "the results for symmetric and asymmetric couplings are exactly the same because @xmath97 is the same in both cases .",
    "the behaviour is very different for finite bias .",
    "[ fig : doszeeman0 ] shows the dos for @xmath93 and different values of the bias voltage .",
    "first , note that eventually , for a certain value of @xmath98 , the dos peak splits in two .",
    "@xmath98 is applied such that the left reservoir has @xmath99 and the right one @xmath100 with respect to the fermi level of the dot .",
    "the splitting in the dos is due to the coupling to the two reservoirs displaced with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "the splitting does not occur symmetrically because the dot _ sees _ the two reservoirs differently , even in the case of symmetric couplings @xmath101 .",
    "if a magnetic field is also applied , a zeeman splitting occurs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : doszeeman30 ] ) and , in turn , each new peak splits due to the finite bias .",
    "let us turn now to the @xmath102 curves . for symmetric contacts ( @xmath103 ) the differential conductance peak",
    "is always centred at zero bias ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : didv](left ) ) .",
    "a magnetic field produces a zeeman splitting and the peak that remains at @xmath104 is due to the orbital degree of freedom .",
    "remember that the peak of the dos for the symmetric case and @xmath93 is away from @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dosv0 ] ( left ) ) , however , the @xmath102 is peaked at zero bias . on the other hand , for the asymmetric case ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : didv ] ( right ) ) the differential conductance peak occurs at finite positive bias for @xmath93 . applying a magnetic field produces a zeeman splitting and a shift towards negative values of the bias of the central su(2 ) peak .",
    "the position of this central peak seems to saturate for a sufficiently large value of the magnetic field .",
    "this can be understood from the density of states : as the magnetic field splits the kondo resonance , owing to the zeeman splitting of the spin sector , more spectral weight is displaced towards lower energies ( close to the fermi energy ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : doszeeman30 ] . when the coupling to the leads is asymmetric , this is reflected as a kondo peak in the differential conductance that moves towards lower bias voltages ( near zero bias ) .",
    "the peak saturates when spin fluctuations are frozen by the magnetic field .",
    "this asymmetric coupling situation is the one discussed in the main text to show agreement with the experimental data .",

    "<S> kondo physics manifests as a zero - bias anomaly in the @xmath3 curves whose width is roughly given by @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> the central peak corresponds to orbital kondo processes in which the spin is conserved . as the magnetic field increases , the central peak moves towards zero bias and the outer peaks have no longer the same height ( the one corresponding to positive voltages being higher ) . </S>",
    "<S> this , again , can be easily understood as resulting from coupling asymmetry : for positive voltages , the distance between the spin - polarized orbital dopant levels and the left chemical potential decreases resulting in a stronger kondo effect as compared with the one for negative voltages where the right reservoir ( the one with lower chemical potential ) is less coupled to the dopant levels . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , only quantum fluctuations between orbital levels are active so the underlying symmetry of the kondo effect is su(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that the valley index is preserved during tunnelling . </S>",
    "<S> this is a necessary condition for the observation of the su(2 ) orbital kondo effect as valley index mixing would destroy it @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to mention that , in order to obtain pure orbital su(2 ) physics in the theoretical calculations , we need to include higher magnetic fields as compared to the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily understood because spin decoherence microscopic mechanisms ( apart from cotunnelling - like finite lifetimes ) are not included in the calculations but are surely present in the experiments ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and supplementary section ) . to be more specific , finite - bias decoherence is also the cause of the experimental suppression of the @xmath41/@xmath42 peaks ratio observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : h64c2kondocond288mk0t10ta ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy with theory , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : h64c2kondocond288mk0t10 tb ] ( a ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : h64c2kondocond288mk0t10 tb ] ( b ) or ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , has nothing to do with kondo physics but with the fact that the experimental peak at @xmath16 = 10 t is less affected by decoherence processes . </S>",
    "<S> overall , there is a very good agreement between the theoretical results and the experiments , as in both case the survival , even at very high magnetic fields , of a simple central ( @xmath2 @xmath43 0 mv ) pure orbital kondo related peak , is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this supports an interpretation of the experimental data in terms of an su(4 ) to su(2 ) crossover driven by magnetic field , where we tune the system between two distinct kondo states . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is also in agreement with experiments in carbon nanotube quantum dots in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite . similarly to our case , the magnetic field in these experiments only couples to the spins and renders the orbital fluctuations unaffected . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated a controlled @xmath44 between su(4 ) and su(2 ) kondo states driven by magnetic field in a nanoscale si transistor . </S>",
    "<S> the latter su(2 ) kondo effect originates _ only _ from quantum fluctuations in the orbital ( valley ) degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform theoretical calculations , including both spin and orbital kondo physics as well as non - equilibrium effects , which confirm our experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the importance of the orbital degree of freedom in novel nano - scaled si systems is confirmed , opening the way to the possible use of different symmetries that the donor orbitals can provide for innovative implementations of si quantum - electronics @xcite such as for example , valley - based quantum computation @xcite .    acknowledgments : this work was supported by the ec fp7 fet - proactive nanoict projects moloc ( 215750 ) and afsid ( 214989 ) and the foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) . </S>",
