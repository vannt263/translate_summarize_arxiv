    "the @xmath0-state potts model on a graph @xmath12 with vertices @xmath13 and edges @xmath14 can be defined geometrically through the cluster expansion of the partition function @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the number of connected components ( clusters ) and the cardinality ( number of links ) of the edge subsets @xmath18 .",
    "we are interested in the case where @xmath19 is a finite regular two - dimensional lattice of width @xmath20 and length @xmath9 , so that @xmath21 can be constructed by a transfer matrix @xmath3 propagating in the @xmath9-direction .    in @xcite",
    ", we studied the case of cyclic boundary conditions ( periodic in the @xmath9-direction and non - periodic in the @xmath20-direction ) .",
    "we decomposed @xmath21 into linear combinations of certain restricted partition functions ( characters ) @xmath22 ( with @xmath8 ) in which @xmath23 _ bridges _ ( that is , marked non - contractible clusters ) wound around the transfer ( @xmath9 ) direction .",
    "we shall often refer to @xmath23 as the _",
    "level_. unlike @xmath21 itself , the @xmath22 could be written as ( restricted ) traces of the transfer matrix , and hence be directly related to its eigenvalues .",
    "it was thus straightforward to deduce from this decomposition the amplitudes in @xmath21 of the eigenvalues of @xmath3 .",
    "the goal of this work is to repeat this procedure in the case of toroidal boundary conditions .",
    "note that as in the cyclic case some other procedures exist .",
    "first , read and saleur have given in  @xcite a general formula for the amplitudes , based on the earlier coulomb gas analysis of di francesco , saleur , and zuber  @xcite .",
    "they obtained that the amplitudes of the eigenvalues are simply @xmath24 at the level @xmath25 and @xmath26 at @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 they obtained that , contrary to the cyclic case , there are several differents amplitudes at each level @xmath23 .",
    "their number is equal to @xmath29 , the number of divisors of @xmath23 .",
    "they are given by : @xmath30 where @xmath23 is the level considered , and @xmath31 is a divisor of @xmath23 which labels the different amplitudes for a given level .",
    "@xmath32 is defined as :    @xmath33    here , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the mbius and euler s totient function  @xcite .",
    "the mbius function @xmath34 is defined by @xmath36 , if @xmath37 is an integer that is a product @xmath38 of @xmath39 _ distinct _ primes , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 otherwise or if @xmath42 is not an integer .",
    "similarly , euler s totient function @xmath35 is defined for positive integers @xmath37 as the number of integers @xmath43 such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the value of @xmath46 depends on @xmath0 and is given by : @xmath47 note that in eq .",
    "( [ deflambda ] ) we may write @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the @xmath37th order chebyshev polynomial of the first kind . the term @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eqsal ] ) is due to configurations containing a cluster with `` cross - topology '' @xcite ( see later ) .",
    "the drawback of the derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite is that since it relies ultimately on free - field techniques it is _ a priori _ valid only at the usual ferromagnetic critical point ( @xmath51 ) and in the continuum limit ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "but one may suspect , in analogy with the cyclic case , that these amplitudes would be valid for any finite lattice and for any inhomogeneous ( i.e. , edge - dependent ) values of the coupling constants @xmath53 .    to our knowledge",
    ", no algebraic study proving this statement does exist in the literature .",
    "indeed , when the boundary conditions are toroidal , the transfer matrix ( of the related six - vertex model , to be precise ) does no longer commute with the generators of the quantum group @xmath54 . therefore , there is no simple algebraic way of obtaining the amplitudes of eigenvalues , although some progress has been made by considering representations of the periodic temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "a good review is given by nichols @xcite .",
    "chang and shrock have studied the potts model with toroidal conditions from a combinatorial point of view @xcite . using a diagrammatic approach they obtained some general results on the eigenvalue amplitudes . in particular",
    ", they showed that the sum of all amplitudes at level @xmath23 equals @xmath55 they also argued that it was because @xmath3 enables permutations among the bridges , due to the periodic boundary conditions in the transverse ( @xmath20 ) direction , that there were different amplitudes for a given level @xmath23 . without them , all the amplitudes at level @xmath23 would be equal ( to a global factor ) to @xmath56 .",
    "finally , they computed explicitly the amplitudes at levels @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; one may check that those results are in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eqsal ] ) .    using the combinatorial approach we developed in  @xcite",
    ", we will make the statements of chang and shrock more precise , and we will give in particular a new interpretation of the amplitudes using the characters of the cyclic group @xmath11 . then , by calculating sums of characters of irreducible representations ( irreps ) of this group , we will reobtain eq .",
    "( [ eqsal ] ) and thus prove its validity for an arbitrary finite @xmath59 lattice . as will become clear below , the argument relies exclusively on counting correctly the number of clusters with non - trivial homotopy , and so the conclusion will hold true for any edge - dependent choice of the coupling constants @xmath53 as well .",
    "our approach will have to deal with several complications due to the boundary conditions , the first of which is that the bridges can now be permuted ( by exploiting the periodic @xmath20-direction ) . in the following",
    "this leads us to consider decomposition of @xmath21 into more elementary quantities than @xmath22 , namely characters @xmath60 labeled by @xmath23 _ and _ a permutation of the cyclic group @xmath11 .",
    "however , @xmath60 is not simply linked to the eigenvalues of @xmath61 , and thus we will further consider its expansion over related quantities @xmath62 , where @xmath10 labels an irreducible representation ( irrep ) of @xmath11 .",
    "it is @xmath62 which are the elementary quantities in the case of toroidal boundary conditions .. the present approach , using only the cyclic group @xmath11 , is far simpler and for the first time allows us to prove eq .",
    "( [ eqsal ] ) . note",
    "also that some misprints had cropped up in ref .",
    "@xcite , giving in particular wrong results for the amplitudes at level @xmath63 . ]    the structure of the article is as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we define appropriate generalisations of the quantities we used in the cyclic case @xcite and we expose all the mathematical background we will need .",
    "then , in section [ sec3 ] , we decompose restricted partition functions  and as a byproduct the total partition function  into characters @xmath22 and @xmath60 .",
    "finally , in section [ sec4 ] , we obtain a general expression of the amplitudes of eigenvalues which involves characters of irreps of @xmath11 . using number theoretic results ( ramanujan sums ) we then proceed to prove its equivalence with the formula  ( [ eqsal ] ) of read and saleur .",
    "as in the cyclic case , the existence of a periodic boundary condition allows for non - trivial clusters ( henceforth abbreviated ntc ) , i.e. , clusters which are not homotopic to a point .",
    "however , the fact that the torus has _ two _ periodic directions means that the topology of the ntc is more complicated that in the cyclic case .",
    "indeed , each ntc belongs to a given homotopy class , which can be characterised by two coprime numbers @xmath65 , where @xmath66 ( resp .",
    "@xmath67 ) denotes the number of times the cluster percolates horizontally ( resp .",
    "vertically ) @xcite .",
    "the fact that all clusters ( non - trivial or not ) are still constrained by planarity to be non - intersecting induces a convenient simplification : all ntc in a given configuration belong to the same homotopy class . for comparison",
    ", we recall that in the cyclic case the only possible homotopy class for a ntc was @xmath68 .",
    "it is a well - known fact @xcite that the difficulty in decomposing the potts model partition function  or relating it to partition functions of locally equivalent models ( of the six - vertex or rsos type)is due solely to the weighing of the ntc .",
    "although a typical cluster configuration will of course contain trivial clusters ( i.e. , clusters that are homotopic to a point ) with seemingly complicated topologies ( e.g. , trivial clusters can surround other trivial clusters , or be surrounded by trivial clusters or by ntc ) , we shall therefore tacitly disregard such clusters in most of the arguments that follow .",
    "note also that a ntc that span both lattice directions in the present context corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "non - trivial clusters ( ntc ) , here represented in red and blue colours .",
    "each ntc is characterised by its number of branches , @xmath70 , and by the permutation it realises , @xmath71 . within a given configuration ,",
    "all ntc have the same topology . ]",
    "consider therefore first the case of a configuration having a single ntc .",
    "for the purpose of studying its topology , we can imagine that is has been shrunk to a line that winds the two periodic directions @xmath65 times . in our approach",
    "we focus on the the properties of the ntc along the direction of propagation of the transfer matrix @xmath3 , henceforth taken as the horizontal direction .",
    "if we imagine cutting the lattice along a vertical line , the ntc will be cut into @xmath66 horizontally percolating parts , which we shall call the @xmath66 _ branches _ of the ntc .",
    "seen horizontally , a given ntc realises a permutation @xmath72 between the vertical coordinates of its @xmath66 branches , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . up to a trivial relabelling of the vertical coordinate ,",
    "the permutation @xmath72 is independent of the horizontal coordinate of the ( imaginary ) vertical cut , and so , forms part of the topological description of the ntc .",
    "we thus describe totally the topology along the horizontal direction of a ntc by @xmath66 and the permutation @xmath73 .",
    "note that there are restrictions on the admissible permutations @xmath72 .",
    "firstly , @xmath72 can not have any proper invariant subspace , or else the corresponding ntc would in fact correspond to several distinct ntc , each having a smaller value of @xmath66 .",
    "for example , the case @xmath74 and @xmath75 is not admissible , as @xmath72 corresponds in fact to two distinct ntc with @xmath70 . in general , therefore , the admissible permutations @xmath72 for a given @xmath66 are simply cyclic permutations of @xmath66 coordinates . secondly , planarity implies that the different branches of a ntc can not intersect , and so not all cyclic permutations are admissible @xmath72 .",
    "for example , the case @xmath74 and @xmath76 is not admissible .",
    "in general the admissible cyclic permutations are characterised by having a constant coordinate difference between two consecutive branches , i.e. , they are of the form @xmath77 for some constant @xmath78 , with all coordinates considered modulo @xmath66 . for example , for @xmath74 , the only admissible permutations are then finally @xmath79 and @xmath80 . ) when we discuss in detail the attribution of `` black points '' to one or more different ntc .",
    "it will then be shown that the admissible permutations at level @xmath23 correspond to the cyclic group @xmath11 .",
    "for example , the admissible permutations at level @xmath63 are @xmath81 , @xmath79 , @xmath82 and @xmath80 . ]    consider now the case of a configuration with several ntc .",
    "recalling that all ntc belong to the same homotopy class , they must all be characterised by the same @xmath66 and @xmath72 .",
    "alternatively one can say that the branches of the different ntc are entangled .",
    "henceforth we denote by @xmath83 the number of ntc with @xmath84 in a given configuration .",
    "note in particular that , seen along the horizontal direction , configurations with no ntc and configurations with one or more ntc percolating only vertically are topologically equivalent .",
    "this is an important limitation of our approach .",
    "let us denote by @xmath85 the partition function of the potts model on an @xmath59 torus , restricted to configurations with exactly @xmath83 ntc characterised by the index @xmath84 and the permutation @xmath86 ; if @xmath72 is not admissible , or if @xmath87 , we set @xmath88 .",
    "further , let @xmath89 be the partition function restricted to configurations with @xmath83 ntc of index @xmath66 , let @xmath90 be the partition function restricted to configurations with @xmath83 ntc _ percolating horizontally _ , and let @xmath21 be the total partition function . obviously , we have @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . in particular",
    ", @xmath94 corresponds to the partition function restricted to configurations with no ntc , or with ntc percolating only vertically .    in the case of a generic lattice",
    "all the @xmath85 are non - zero , provided that @xmath72 is an admissible cyclic permutation of length @xmath66 , and that @xmath95 .",
    "the triangular lattice is a simple example of a generic lattice .",
    "note however that other regular lattices may be unable to realise certain admissible @xmath72 .",
    "for example , in the case of a square lattice or a honeycomb lattice , all @xmath85 with @xmath96 and @xmath97 are zero , since there is not enough `` space '' on the lattice to permit all ntc branches to percolate horizontally while realising a non - trivial permutation .",
    "such non - generic lattices introduce additional difficulties in the analysis which have to be considered on a case - to - case basis . in the following ,",
    "we consider therefore the case of a generic lattice .",
    "the construction and structure of the transfer matrix @xmath98 can be taken over from the cyclic case @xcite .",
    "in particular , we recall that @xmath99 acts towards the right on states of connectivities between two time slices ( left and right ) and has a block - trigonal structure with respect to the number of _ bridges _ ( connectivity components linking left and right ) and a block - diagonal structure with respect to the residual connectivity among the non - bridged points on the left time slice . as before , we denote by @xmath100 the diagonal block with a fixed number of bridges @xmath23 and a trivial residual connectivity .",
    "each eigenvalue of @xmath98 is also an eigenvalue of one or more @xmath100 . in analogy with @xcite",
    "we shall sometimes call @xmath101 the transfer matrix at level @xmath23 .",
    "it acts on connectivity states which can be represented graphically as a partition of the @xmath20 points in the right time slice with a special marking ( represented as a _ black point _ ) of precisely @xmath23 distinct components of the partition ( i.e. , the components that are linked to the left time slice via a bridge ) .",
    "a crucial difference with the cyclic case is that for a given partition of the right time slice , there are more possibilities for attributing the black points ( for @xmath102 ) . considering for the moment the black points to be indistinguishable , we denote the corresponding dimension as @xmath103 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that n_tor(l , l ) =    ll & l=0 + 2l-1 l-1 & l=1",
    "+ 2l l - l & 2",
    "[ defntor ] and clearly @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "suppose now that a connectivity state at level @xmath23 is time evolved by a cluster configuration of index @xmath66 and corresponding to a permutation @xmath72 .",
    "this can be represented graphically by adjoining the initial connectivity state to the left rim of the cluster configuration , as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and reading off the final connectivity state as seen from the right rim of the cluster configuration .",
    "evidently , the positions of the black points in the final state will be permuted with respect to their positions in the intial state , according to the permutation @xmath72 .",
    "as we have seen , not all @xmath72 are admissible .",
    "we will show in the subsection  [ sec : decklcl ] that the possible permutations at a given level @xmath23 ( taking into account all the ways of attributing @xmath23 black points to cluster configurations ) are the elements of the cyclic group @xmath11 . of all permutations at level @xmath23 ,",
    "not just the admissible permutations .",
    "therefore the dimension of @xmath100 they obtained was @xmath106 .",
    "although this approach is permissible ( since in any case @xmath100 will have zero matrix elements between states which are related by a non - admissible permutation ) it is more complicated @xcite than the one we present here.]the number of possible connectivity states without taking into account the possible permutations between black points , the dimension of @xmath107 is @xmath108 , as @xmath11 has @xmath23 distinct elements .",
    "let us denote by @xmath109 ( where @xmath110 ) the @xmath111 standard connectivity states at level @xmath23 .",
    "the full space of connectivities at level @xmath23 , i.e. , with @xmath23 distinguishable black points , can then be obtained by subjecting the @xmath109 to permutations of the black points .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath100 commutes with the permutations between black points ( the physical reason being that @xmath101 can not `` see '' to which positions on the left time slice each bridge is attached ) .",
    "therefore @xmath100 itself has a block structure in a appropriate basis .",
    "indeed , @xmath100 can be decomposed into @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the restriction of @xmath100 to the states transforming according to the irreducible representation ( irrep ) @xmath114 of @xmath11 .",
    "note that as @xmath11 is a abelian group of @xmath23 elements , it has @xmath23 irreps of dimension @xmath115 .",
    "one can obtain the corresponding basis by applying the projectors @xmath116 on all the connectivity states at level @xmath23 , where @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 here @xmath118 is the character of @xmath72 in the irrep @xmath114 and @xmath119 is its complex conjugate .",
    "the application of all permutations of @xmath11 on any given standard vector @xmath109 generates a regular representation of @xmath11 , which contains therefore once each representation @xmath114 ( of dimension @xmath115 ) . as there are @xmath111 standard vectors , the dimension of @xmath112 is thus simply @xmath103 . instead of @xmath11 we would have had algebraic degeneracies , which would have complicated considerably the determination of the amplitudes of eigenvalues .",
    "in fact , it turns out that even by considering @xmath11 there are degeneracies between eigenvalues of different levels , as noticed by chang and shrock  @xcite .",
    "but these degeneracies depend of the width @xmath20 , and have no simple algebraic interpretation . ]",
    "we now define , as in the cyclic case @xcite , @xmath22 as the trace of @xmath121 .",
    "since @xmath100 commutes with @xmath11 , we can write @xmath122 in distinction with the cyclic case , we can not decompose the partition function @xmath21 over @xmath22 because of the possible permutations of black points ( see below ) .",
    "we shall therefore resort to more elementary quantities , the @xmath120 , which we define as the trace of @xmath123 . since",
    "both @xmath100 and the projectors @xmath116 commute with @xmath11 , we have @xmath124 obviously one has @xmath125 the sum being over all the @xmath23 irreps @xmath114 of @xmath11 .",
    "recall that in the cyclic case the amplitudes of the eigenvalues at level @xmath23 are all identical .",
    "this is no longer the case , since the amplitudes depend on @xmath114 as well . indeed",
    "@xmath126 in order to decompose @xmath21 over @xmath120 we will first use auxiliary quantities , the @xmath127 defined as : @xmath128 @xmath129 being an element of the cyclic group @xmath11 .",
    "so @xmath127 can be thought of as modified traces in which the final state differs from the initial state by the application of @xmath129 .",
    "note that @xmath130 is simply equal to @xmath131 .",
    "because of the possible permutations of the black points , the decomposition of @xmath21 will contain not only the @xmath132 but also all the other @xmath127 , with @xmath133 .",
    "we will show that the coefficients before @xmath127 coincide for all @xmath133 that belong to the same class _ with respect to the symmetric group @xmath134_. is an abelian group , each of its elements defines a class of its own , if the notion of class is taken with respect to @xmath11 itself .",
    "what we need here is the non - trivial classes defined with respect to @xmath134 . ]",

    "this definition will enable us to simplify some formulas , but ultimately we will come back to the @xmath127 .",
