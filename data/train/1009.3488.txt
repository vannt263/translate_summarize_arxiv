    "our universe is presently at the stage of accelerating expansion , as suggested by the cosmological observations @xcite . assuming a homogeneous and isotropic universe and based on general relativity ( gr )",
    ", one can not explain this late - time cosmic acceleration if the universe contains only matter and radiation .",
    "a substance with negative pressure adding to the right - hand side of the einstein field equations , known as dark energy @xcite , can lead to the cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "observations @xcite suggest that our universe should be nearly flat and consist of 73% dark energy , 22% dark matter , 5% ordinary matter , and approximated 0.008% radiation .",
    "it is ironic that so far our knowledge of physics can only explain 5% of the universe , with nearly 95% of the universe remained unexplained .",
    "this is the most challenging issue for the physicists of the 21st century .    instead of invoking dark energy ,",
    "there have been attempts to modify the left - hand side of the einstein equations , e.g.  via proposing alternative gravity theories , to explain the late - time acceleration @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these attempts are known as modified gravity . among these theories , in the present paper we will focus on the @xmath0 theory of modified gravity where the einstein - hilbert lagrangian density is added by a general function of the ricci scalar , @xmath0 .",
    "a.  a.  starobinsky was the first to point out that de sitter space , and therefore the exponential expansion of spacetime , can be achieved in the early universe by quantum correction , ( @xmath6 ) , to the einstein - hilbert action @xcite .",
    "this uv modification leads to an early accelerating universe ( starobinsky inflation ) and motivates people to construct the @xmath0 models @xcite to explain the late - time acceleration of the universe .",
    "since the @xmath0 theory is equivalent to the brans - dicke theory with the brans - dicke parameter @xmath7 @xcite , it seems that this is already ruled out by the constraint @xmath8 set by observations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was pointed out recently that in a non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory the scalar field may have a scale- or environment - dependent mass via its interaction with matter @xcite .",
    "that is , the higher ( lower ) the matter density is , the more ( less ) massive the scalar field is .",
    "consequently , in the solar system , which has a much higher density than the universe , the scalar field would have a large effective mass ( and therefore a small compton wavelength ) so that it can evade the solar - system tests . at the mean time",
    ", the same scalar field would have a much smaller effective mass at cosmological scales , as small as the present hubble expansion rate ( i.e.  a long compton wavelength comparable to the size of the universe ) .",
    "accordingly , it can be a candidate driving the late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "the sensitivity to the environment of such a scalar field interaction gives the name , `` chameleon mechanism '' @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate various tests of the @xmath0 theory of modified gravity . as an alternative to dark energy for driving the late - time cosmic acceleration",
    ", the @xmath0 theory needs to pass the cosmological tests , including the constraints about ( 1 ) the cosmic expansion and ( 2 ) the cosmic structure formation .",
    "in addition , as a modified gravity theory , it needs to pass ( 3 ) the solar - system test , such as the constraints on the brans - dicke theory .",
    "the process of these three tests in the present paper are described in the following .    *",
    "( 1 ) cosmic expansion history : * for the background cosmic expansion there is a degeneracy between @xmath0 modified gravity and gr with dark energy , that is , one can not distinguish between these two theories via the observations about the cosmic expansion history such as type ia supernovae ( snia ) and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "this is because for any given expansion history @xmath9 one can always construct a function @xmath0 to generate the required expansion .",
    "the @xmath0 model so constructed is called `` designer @xmath0 '' @xcite . to fit the observational constraint on @xmath9",
    ", we take the designer @xmath0 approach to ( re)construct @xmath0 for possible expansion histories , where @xmath0 is specified by @xmath9 and the initial condition , particularly the value of @xmath10 at some initial time , as denoted by @xmath11 . in the present paper",
    "we consider the expansion history @xmath9 given by the effective dark energy equation of state @xmath3 as specified by the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite , @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is redshift ) , with the current observational constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite . in this case",
    "the designer @xmath0 is parametrized by three parameters , @xmath16 .",
    "we then test such designer @xmath17 model via the cosmic - structure observations and the solar - system experiments .    *",
    "( 2 ) cosmic structure formation : * for each designer @xmath17 obtained above we calculate the theoretical prediction of the cosmological perturbations , particularly @xmath1 and @xmath18 at late times and at subhorizon scales , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are two metric potentials in the newtonian gauge , and @xmath2 and @xmath21 are the effective gravitational coupling and the newtonian constant , respectively . in gr",
    "these two ratios are both unity , while in @xmath0 modified gravity they generally change with time and scales . for the test",
    "we compare the theoretical prediction with the observational requirements from the cosmic structure observations , thereby constraining @xmath17 , i.e. , obtaining the constraints on the parameter space @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , we obtain the allowed range of @xmath11 for various @xmath23 under consideration .    *",
    "( 3 ) solar - system tests : * the solar - system experiments provide stringent constraints on the brans - dicke theory with the chameleon mechanism , and accordingly tightly constrain the behavior of @xmath0 for @xmath24 @xcite . to do the solar - system test , for each designer",
    "@xmath17 we check whether it is consistent with this constraint on @xmath25 .    through the above three tests",
    "we find that only the models which closely mimic gr with a cosmological constant can survive these three tests .",
    "that is , among the @xmath17 models under consideration , only the case where @xmath26 or @xmath27 very close to @xmath28 survives these three tests . for comparison ,",
    "when we consider only the cosmological tests , i.e.  the tests ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , for each @xmath29 under consideration we find the allowed range of @xmath11 very narrow although existing .",
    "this presents a severe fine - tuning of the initial condition of @xmath0 for passing the cosmological tests .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ background ]",
    "we introduce the basics of the background evolution in the @xmath0 theory , the construction of the designer @xmath0 models , and the evolution of the cosmological perturbations with the late - time and the subhorizon approximations . in sec .",
    "[ obs ] we introduce the observational constraints set by the observations about the cosmic expansion and the cosmic structures and by the solar - system experiments . in sec.[results ] we show the results of the three tests .",

    "the variation of this action with respect to the metric tensor gives the gravitational field equations , @xmath33 where the dalembertian operator @xmath34 , @xmath35 , likewise @xmath36 , and the energy - momentum tensor of the cosmic fluid @xmath37 .",
    "regarding the background evolution , we consider the flat robertson - walker metric for describing the background space - time , @xmath38 and the perfect fluids for the energy contents , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the energy density and pressure .",
    "we then obtain two evolution equations describing the cosmic expansion : @xmath42 where an over - dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath43 , the hubble expansion rate @xmath44 , the ricci scalar @xmath45 , and we have used @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "equation ( [ eff2friedmann ] ) shows that matter and radiation can simply contribute to deceleration , while the deviation from gr may induce accelerated expansion when its contribution therein , @xmath48 , is negative and significant .",
    "in addition , from these equations one can see that the @xmath0 theory comes back to gr ( with a cosmological constant @xmath4 ) at the background level when @xmath49 .",
    "the above two equations can be recast in the form in gr : @xmath50 here @xmath51 and @xmath52 are respectively the effective energy density and the effective pressure contributed from the deviation from gr , @xmath0 , and are defined as @xmath53 , \\label{effrho } \\\\",
