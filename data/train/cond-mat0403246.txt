    "@xcite summarised here show that in order to extract the value of @xmath52 in @xmath5 within a bosonic field theory , one must perform a sum over all diagrams that contain relevant initial state operators .",

    "we hence expect the analysis to be even more cumbersome for the @xmath0-species process .",
    "yet the possibility of species segregation must be encoded precisely in these contributions from the initial state .    to explain the @xmath0-dependence of the asymptotic regime ,",
    "one then needs a field theory representation where the special topology of the one - dimensional case becomes manifest .",
    "an example is provided by the theory of quantum spin chains . in appendix b ,",
    "we discuss how the annihilation model can be mapped onto an anisotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain . the appropriate continuum limit for the low - lying excitation yields generalised nonlinear sigma models with topological chern - simons terms . for the @xmath0-species mam , the different topological sectors for each @xmath0 will become mixed through the annihilation processes .",
    "we conjecture that the presence of these topological terms , effective only near one dimension , must be responsible for the @xmath0-dependence of the density decay exponent in the asymptotic regime . yet",

    "_ [ secsmam]_. in higher dimensions @xmath8 the topological terms do not play any significant role , which supports that the rg analysis of section [ subrg ] predicts the correct mam asymptotic behaviour .      yet before proceeding , we note that special initial conditions can alter the generic asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath0-mam . for instance , if the particles live on a one - dimensional lattice , their respective rank can be labeled starting from a given origin .",
    "since particles only vanish in pairs , the parity of each particle rank is a locally conserved quantity .",
    "this immediately implies that if one starts with a correlated configuration such as @xmath188 the parity of @xmath0 will dictate the long - time decay of the density .",
    "on the one hand , if @xmath0 is odd , two particles of the same species always have an even number of particles between each other .",
    "hence these particles can annihilate by pairs and two particles of the same species can become nearest - neighbours after some annihilation reactions have occurred",
    ". therefore the subtle initial correlations will be wiped out eventually and segregation becomes possible , leading to an asymptotic density decay as in the @xmath0-mam ( albeit following a potentially large crossover period ) .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath0 is even , the particles lying between two identical particles can not entirely annihilate each other . in that situation , particles of the same species never meet on adjacent lattice sites , species segregation can not occur , and the density decays as in the single - species pair annihilation reaction @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ , with @xmath189 .",
    "in order to address the one - dimensional case , we now introduce a simplified version of the mam , to be referred to as smam , which retains only the bare essentials of the original model .",
    "we begin by noting that the particle configuration may at any time be decomposed into a sequence of domains , each comprising only a _ single _ particle species , such that adjacent domains contain different species .",
    "owing to the diffusive nature of the process the typical domain size increases as @xmath190 , as we shall confirm numerically in sec .",
    "[ secmc ] . combining this with the expectation that @xmath191",
    ", we may express the average particle number @xmath192 in a domain as @xmath193 clearly , unbounded domain growth , hence species segregation , can only occur if @xmath194 . the emergence of segregation thus necessarily implies a _ slower _ density decay than predicted for the homogeneous system ( @xmath189 ) in one dimension .    inspired by eq .",
    "( [ drhodt1 ] ) we now introduce the hypothesis that fluctuations in the effective annihilation rate @xmath73 , whether in the course of time or between different reaction zones , are not crucial and may be ignored because in one dimension the segregation effect will dominate at least the long - time dynamics .",
    "this leads us directly to the smam picture : _ the particle content of each domain , owing to the annihilation reactions taking place at both of its ends , decreases at the constant rate _ @xmath195 .",
    "this picture is then completed by the rule for what happens when a domain disappears , _",
    "i.e. _ , gets emptied of all its particles : then , either the left and right neighbouring domains have the same species of particles and fuse into a single new domain ; or the neighbouring domains have different particle species and a new reaction zone appears between them .",
    "these two possibilities correspond to annihilation and coalescence of domain walls , respectively .",
    "we already note that it is precisely via these two different scenarios , whose respective probabilities depend on the overall number of species , that the decay exponent @xmath52 eventually becomes a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the following algorithm makes this explicit .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional lattice ( ` chain ' ) whose sites , labeled by indices @xmath196 , represent the _ domains _ of the original mam .",
    "below we will indifferently refer to them as ` sites ' or as ` domains ' .",

    "to start , we randomly select @xmath197 _ number variables _",
    "@xmath198 , drawn independently from some probability distribution on the positive integers ; these variables represent the initial numbers of particles in the domains .",
    "we then assign initially to each domain a particle type ( ` colour ' ) in a random fashion , except for the restriction that neighbouring domains are not allowed the same colour .",
    "yet note that the subsequent algorithm does not require that we assign these colours explicitly .",
    "the time evolution subsequent to this random initial condition proceeds via _ deterministic _ iterations .",
    "the @xmath199th iteration changes the total number of sites from @xmath200 to @xmath201 and converts the set of values @xmath202 to @xmath203 .",
    "the following update consists of four steps :    1 .",
    "the values of all @xmath204 are reduced by @xmath205 .",
    "all sites @xmath206 which after step ( i ) have @xmath207 are eliminated from the lattice .",
    "the remaining sites are reconnected in such a way that their ordering along the chain remains unchanged .",
    "sites which as a result of step ( ii ) have become nearest - neighbour sites and which have the same colour , are fused into a single site of that colour ; the number variables of the fusing sites are added together .",
    "we write @xmath201 for the remaining number of sites , and relabel these sites by an index @xmath208 that runs from @xmath205 to @xmath201 along the chain .",
    "we began our investigation by actually running this algorithm on the computer , and found these simulations to converge rapidly and yield accurate exponent values .",
    "these advantages were however superseded by our discovery that the above algorithm is actually amenable to an asymptotically exact solution .    in order to keep track of the colours of the sites , in our computer implementations of this algorithm",
    "we also used a set of _ colour variables _ @xmath209 , where @xmath210 represents the colour of the @xmath206th site after the @xmath211th iteration . in our discussion below of the analytic solution of the algorithm our dealing with these variables will be implicit .",

    "this model obeys an exact closed set of equations , which we shall now derive and analyse . in this subsection",
    "we will suppress the iteration index @xmath211 and will denote , preceding the @xmath211th iteration , the number of domains containing precisely @xmath228 particles by @xmath229 , the total number of domains by @xmath230 , and the fraction of domains that contain precisely @xmath228 particles by @xmath231 . for the corresponding quantities after the @xmath211th iteration we shall use primed symbols , _",
