    "one of the most challenging current attempts in cosmology is to relate the origin and evolution of large - scale structure to the observed properties of qso absorption - line systems .",
    "several groups have now performed sophisticated hydro simulations of various hierarchical models ( cdm , cdm+@xmath4 , hcdm ) to clarify the above issues . in spite of the great advances provided by numerical approaches , their results",
    "are still not conclusive ( and often hard even to compare ) since the physics included is necessarily limited by computational economy . in particular , the study of effects as feedback and radiative transfer , whose importance , particularly for small objects  such as , presumably , the very first generation of galaxies ( pop  iii )  can hardly be overlooked , is still in its youth ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "these facts motivate the effort to develop versatile semi - analytical models , that could co - operatively complement numerical studies . here",
    "we present one such whose aim is to test the hypothesis that ly@xmath0 qso absorption lines originate in gaseous halos produced by multiple supernova explosions occurring in pop  iii objects in a cdm cosmological scenario .",
    "we assume a cdm power spectrum of fluctuations as in efstathiou ( 1992 ) , @xmath5^{\\nu } \\right\\}^{2/ \\nu } } , \\label{powerspectrum}\\ ] ] where @xmath6=1.13 ; @xmath7=6.4 @xmath8 mpc ; @xmath9=3.0 @xmath8 mpc ; @xmath10=1.7 @xmath8 mpc ; @xmath11=1 .",
    "the previous spectrum describes a `` standard '' cdm model with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , our adopted values ; we also take @xmath14 ( from coma cluster data , white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "the power spectrum normalization has been determined from _ cobe _ , yielding @xmath15 ( efstathiou 1992 ) . to obtain the number density of dark matter ( dm ) halos , @xmath11 , as a function of redshift , @xmath16 , and of their circular velocity , @xmath17^{1/2}$ ] , we use the press  schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 , ps ) following white & frenk ( 1991 ) : @xmath18 ; \\label{dhaloesdensity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + @xmath19 is a critical value of the overdensity and @xmath20 is the variance of fluctuations on scale @xmath21 : @xmath22 we used three different window functions @xmath23 : ( i ) gaussian , ( ii ) sharp k - space , ( iii ) top - hat .",
    "the results are very weakly dependent on the specific choice of @xmath23 ; we adopt a top - hat window function since it gives the best agreement with numerical simulations for @xmath24 ( lacey & cole 1994 ) .",
    "as dm halos are formed , baryons settle dissipatively into their potential well , being heated by virialization shocks .",
    "both baryonic evolution and galaxy formation can be influenced by another important heating / ionization source , the ultraviolet background radiation field ( uvb ) ; its potential importance has been recently discussed by efstathiou ( 1992 ) ( see also thoul & weinberg 1996 ) , who emphasized its role in delaying or even suppressing the formation of very low @xmath25 objects .      in the absence of ionizing radiation",
    ", baryons can collapse freely in the gravitational potential of the dm , allowing for the formation of the first proto - galaxies .",
    "these objects , which we will refer to collectively as pop  iii , should have masses @xmath26 in order to be able to cool in a hubble time ( tegmark 1997 ) . according to ps , the formation peak for these objects",
    "is at @xmath27 .",
    "assuming an efficiency of uv photon production per collapsed proton @xmath28 ( tegmark 1994 ) , and an average life time of massive stars @xmath29  yr , the ionizing photon rate per galaxy is @xmath30  s@xmath31 .",
    "these photons will produce expanding hii regions in the surrounding igm , eventually overlapping . to determine the epoch of complete reionization we calculate the igm porosity parameter , @xmath32 , defined by @xmath33 , with @xmath34  mpc being the radius of the hii region .",
    "complete overlap ( @xmath35 , smith 1976 ) occurs at @xmath36 ; this value depends on @xmath37 ( @xmath38 $ ] for @xmath39 m_{\\odot}$ ] ) . for @xmath40",
    "the uvb is approximated as a power law spectrum with index @xmath0 and intensity at the lyman limit ( haardt & madau 1996 , ferrara & giallongo 1996 [ fg ] ) : @xmath41 & 3<z\\leq 7 , \\\\",
    "( 1+z)^{1/4 } & 2\\leq z \\leq 3 , \\\\ ( 1+z)^{3 } & z<2 .",
    "\\end{array}\\right . \\label{normflux}\\ ] ] + where @xmath42 .      as the uvb heats the igm , it can prevent the gas from collapsing and forming proto - galaxies if the igm temperature , @xmath43 , is higher than the virial temperature , @xmath44 , of the corresponding dm halo .",
    "we have derived the temperature and ionization evolution of the igm ( assumed of primordial chemical composition ) from the standard time - dependent energy and ionization equations .",
    "the cooling function is described in fg ; we have studied two cases corresponding to values of @xmath45 mimicking a hard , agn - dominated ( soft , galaxy - dominated ) spectrum .",
    "we have also explored different initial values @xmath46 finding that this parameter has essentially no influence on the results , as already stressed by fg : we take therefore @xmath47  k. the condition @xmath48 defines a minimum circular velocity , @xmath49 , ( or equivalently a minimum mass ) for collapse , shown in fig .",
    "galaxies with _ total _ mass below @xmath50 are prevented from collapsing after the onset of the uvb ; of course @xmath51  km  s@xmath31 for @xmath52 .",
    "as the gas collapses towards the center of the proto - galaxy , the density enhancement is very likely to trigger star formation ( sf ) .",
    "star forming regions will inject energy into the galactic ism , largely in the form of supernova explosions : for a miller - scalo imf , one supernova is expected for each 56  @xmath53 of stars formed .",
    "type  ii sne tend to occur in associations , generating very energetic multiple explosions whose observational signature is an expanding supershell .",
    "if the galaxy mass is low , its entire gas content could be swept by the shell , and driven into the surrounding igm , in a process called _ blow - away_. the expanding shell will be eventually confined by the igm pressure , provided it is high enough .",
    "the blow - away condition essentially requires that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a geometrical factor ( details in ferrara & tolstoy 1997 ) . the previous condition determines the maximum circular velocity for which the blow - away can occur , @xmath56  km  s@xmath31 for our parameters , also shown in fig . 1 ; more massive objects will escape disruption .",
    "hence , only objects with @xmath57 will be able to generate a secondary halo , via a shell _ re_-expansion , as explained below . since the gas is lost , further sf is inhibited , and the remnant is a faint agglomerate of low mass stars produced in the first ( and last ) sf episode .",
    "next we derive the evolution of the ( spherical ) supershell radius , @xmath58 , in the thin - shell approximation ( kompaneets 1957 ) .",
    "the unperturbed external medium has density @xmath59 for @xmath60 , corresponding to the galaxy ism , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 , the igm density .",
    "the shell is driven by the pressure , @xmath63 , of the hot gas in the bubble cooling at a rate @xmath64 , and subject to the gravitational pull of the dm halo ( we neglect self - gravity of baryons ) .",
    "the sn mechanical luminosity is @xmath65 ergs  s@xmath31 , where @xmath66 is the sn rate , @xmath67 is the sf efficiency and @xmath68 is the free - fall time of the gas .",
    "the evolution of @xmath58 is governed by energy and momentum conservation equations ( subscripts @xmath69 and @xmath70 refer to bubble and shell , respectively ) : @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "2 shows the behavior of @xmath58 as a function of @xmath16 for different values of @xmath25 and corresponding dm halo formation redshift @xmath74 ; the evolution is followed up to the stagnation point , @xmath75 sound speed in the igm .",
    "secondary halos associated with dm halos formed at @xmath52 are larger , since their expansion is unimpeded until the reionization epoch due to the low igm pressure ; the final size increases with @xmath25 , since @xmath76 .",
    "the final value of @xmath77 depends on @xmath78 : sizes of the order of tens of kpc are obtained setting @xmath79 the igm pressure , or @xmath80  k  @xmath81 at @xmath82 .",
    "this value is typical of the environments of spiral galaxies and groups : for the galactic halo at @xmath83  kpc , @xmath84  k  @xmath81 ( wolfire 1995 ) .",
    "lower values of @xmath78 result in larger sizes and lower densities .",
    "once the stalling point is reached , as the shell pressure is higher than @xmath85 , the inner boundary of the shell re - expands back into the cavity .",
    "the expansion ends when pressure equilibrium across the contact discontinuity has been achieved : from this condition we derive the shell thickness , @xmath86 .",
    "we find that the ratio @xmath87 in all cases and it often exceeds 0.8 .",
    "in addition , the re - expansion factor can be enhanced by a magnetic field ( slavin & cox 1992 ) and by accounting for cooling of hot bubble gas .",
    "for this reason , we assume that the volume inside @xmath77 is uniformly filled with blown - away baryons with density @xmath88 .",
    "we are now able to test the main hypothesis of this work , that the secondary baryonic halos so found can be responsible for ly@xmath0 absorption lines . as a preliminary test ( a complete study is devoted to a forthcoming paper )",
    "we have derived the neutral hydrogen column density of the clouds and their redshift distribution . assuming a value for the secondary halo gas ( or the ly@xmath0 clouds , in our view ) temperature of @xmath89  k , consistent with a purely thermal doppler parameter @xmath90  km  s@xmath31 ( lu _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , we have determined the hi density , @xmath91 , from ionization equilibrium , integrating along a line of sight at impact parameter @xmath92 , we find hydrogen column densities @xmath93 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , with the highest @xmath1 originating in low @xmath74 halos .",
    "column densities @xmath94  @xmath3 are associated with secondary halos formed at very high redshift , @xmath95 , where merging  that we have neglected  should be rather important . the redshift distribution of the clouds",
    ", @xmath96 can be very nicely fit by a power law @xmath97 with @xmath98 and @xmath99=0.7 , in satisfactory agreement with observational data ( bechtold 1994 , giallongo 1996 ) at this stage .",
    "we have brought arguments suggesting that at least some ly@xmath0 qso absorption lines could originate in secondary halos produced by multiple supernova explosions occurring in pop  iii objects . as a first step ,",
    "we have investigated only a specific cdm model ; nevertheless our aim is to extend the analysis to a larger class of theoretical models ( cdm+@xmath4 , hcdm ) in this paper we have introduced the main features of our semi - analytical model , deferring a complete exploration of the results , cosmological models , and model details to a forthcoming paper .",
    "yet , two conclusions could be relevant : ( i ) ly@xmath0 clouds should be preferentially found in relatively high pressure regions , as galaxy halos and groups ; ( ii ) hi column densities and redshift distribution are well reproduced by a cdm model if clouds are associated with galaxy halos or groups .",
    "we reiterate that predictions for @xmath100  @xmath3 might be affected by the simplifications adopted ( no merging ) . in view of the exploration of additional cosmological models , it is important to compare the model predictions on other observables as the @xmath101 and @xmath69 distributions , and clustering properties .",
    "the metallicity @xmath102 found in clouds with @xmath103  @xmath3 by cowie ( 1995 ) and tytler ( 1995 ) could be explained by primordial enrichment by pop  iii objects .",
    "a back - on - the envelope calculation using the sn rates from our model and assuming a metal yield of @xmath104 per sn , gives @xmath105 in the secondary halo ."
