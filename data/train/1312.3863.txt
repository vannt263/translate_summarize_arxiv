    "a topological insulator is a material with an insulating energy gap in its bulk , but possesses conducting surface states due to significant spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the existence of these surface states is guaranteed by a topological invariant making them particularly robust against time - reversal invariant perturbations or disorder . due to spin - orbit coupling",
    "the surface states are spin - momentum coupled allowing for interesting potential spintronics applications . the dispersion of the surface states forms a dirac cone , i.e. the conduction electrons at the surface are effectively massless .",
    "this peculiar state of matter has first been suggested theoretically @xcite and afterwards confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the number of materials identified as three dimensional topological insulators ( 3dti ) is steadily increasing @xcite .    in the present work we study 3dti in the presence of a ferromagnetic exchange field .",
    "experimentally , it has been demonstrated that such fields can be introduced into topological insulators either by doping with ferromagnetic dopants  @xcite or by proximity to ferromagnetic materials @xcite .",
    "as the ferromagnetic exchange field breaks time - reversal symmetry , it allows for controlled modification or removal of the surface states and could lead to interesting effects or devices @xcite . in previous work",
    "it has been pointed out that depending on the relative orientation of the exchange field with respect to the surface of the topological insulator , the surface states may open an energy gap or remain intact @xcite .",
    "however , only small exchange splittings have been considered . in the present work we are considering exchange splittings up to the order of the gap of the topological insulator , which is up to 0.3  ev for present materials .",
    "exchange splittings of the order of 1  ev can be reached with ferromagnetic materials .    in a recent work",
    "we have studied a two dimensional thin strip of a particle - hole symmetric topological insulator and found that under exchange fields of such strength an edge state flat band can appear @xcite .",
    "such flat bands are of particular interest , because the group velocity vanishes allowing highly localized wave packets .",
    "flat bands have been found previously in other condensed matter systems like graphene , superfluid @xmath2he , or unconventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "in particular , the appearence of flat bands in @xmath3-wave superconductors as surface andreev bound states has been studied well in the past both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "such surface flat bands have been shown to lead to an enhanced barrier for vortex entry @xcite or increased nonlinear electromagnetic reponse @xcite .",
    "however , it remained an open question whether flat bands may also appear in three dimensional topological insulators under sufficiently strong ferromagnetic exchange fields .    in the present work",
    ", we will present a systematic investigation of the possible surface states of 3dti and their behavior under a ferromagnetic exchange field .",
    "we will show under which circumstances surface flat bands appear .",
    "in particular , we identify a case in which a two dimensional flat band can be generated .",
    "we demonstrate that the appearence of our flat bands can be understood in terms of a classification recently proposed by matsuura et al @xcite using a topological invariant in the presence of a chiral symmetry .",
    "we will also show that the exchange field can produce highly anisotropic dirac cones , i.e. that the group velocity is different in different directions .",
    "in this case the velocity can be tuned by rotation of the exchange field , i.e. rotation of the remanent magnetization of the ferromagnetism .",
    "recently the possibility of realizing a weyl semimetallic state in pyrochlore iridates has raised a lot of interest @xcite .",
    "this state is a generalization of the two - dimensional dirac electrons in graphene to a three - dimensional bulk system . in a weyl semimetal conduction band and valence band touch each other only at a finite number of points .",
    "these so - called weyl nodes are exceptionally stable for topological reasons .",
    "of particular interest are the surface states of a weyl semimetal which may form open fermi `` arcs '' @xcite . in the present work",
    "we show that a 3dti with a sufficiently strong ferromagnetic exchange field becomes a weyl semimetal in most cases .",
    "the surface flat bands are directly related to the appearence of surface fermi arcs in this system .",
    "in contrast to previous proposals for surface flat bands in other systems like graphene , superfluid @xmath2he , or unconventional superconductors the present system has the advantage that the relevant energy scale is much larger ( @xmath4 0.3  ev ) .",
    "this allows observation of the flat bands at room temperature , while for all other previous proposals cryogenic temperatures are necessary .",
    "in addition , the surface states can be tuned by rotation of the exchange field .",
    "for example , the flat band can be turned on and off by a rotation of the remanent magnetization of a ferromagnet .",
    "we demonstrate that such behavior can be achieved for realistic material parameters leading to new possible spintronic devices .",
    "as a starting point we consider the generic effective two - orbital hamiltonian for a three dimensional topological insulator suggested already in several previous works @xcite . to facilitate numerical calculations we choose the lattice regularized version that has been suggested by li et al @xcite : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the dirac @xmath11 matrices are represented by @xmath12 in the spin - orbit basis . here",
    ", the pauli matrices in orbital space are denoted by @xmath13 and the ones in spin space by @xmath14 . as has been pointed out by hao and lee  @xcite ,",
    "there exist the following two different choices for @xmath15 : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these correspond to two different types of spin - orbit coupling in @xmath18-direction .",
    "we follow the convention of hao and lee and denote these two choices as model i and model ii , respectively . note that if @xmath19 there is no difference between the two models .",
    "model i is isotropic within the @xmath20-plane , but the coupling in @xmath18-direction is different .",
    "thus one has qualitatively different behavior of surface states at a @xmath18-boundary than at an @xmath21- or @xmath22-boundary . for model ii",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is isotropic and it is sufficient to consider surface states at one selected boundary , because the qualitative behavior is the same in all three spatial directions .",
    "it has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the absence of an exchange field model i and model ii are related by a unitary transformation and a 90 degree rotation within the @xmath20-plane . however , this is not true anymore in the presence of an exchange field , because the spin operators are mapped to pseudospin operators under the unitary transformation as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "thus , for the purpose of the present work the two models become different in the presence of an exchange field .",
    "model i is appropriate for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and its relatives .",

    "we will discuss the modifications that appear when particle - hole symmetry is slightly broken , as is the case in the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 family of materials .",
    "for @xmath35 the four bulk bands for model i can be found by analytical diagonalization of the @xmath36 matrices and are given by @xmath37 while for model ii we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "as is clear from these expressions , the bulk spectrum is fully symmetric around energy @xmath41 for both models .",

    "however , application of an exchange field in any direction breaks time reversal symmetry . according to the classification by schnyder et al @xcite a system with broken time reversal symmetry",
    "may still be topologically nontrivial , if a chiral symmetry is present .",

    "is respected for @xmath19 .    from these considerations",
    "we see that hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) under certain circumstances falls into the aiii chiral symmetry class and we have identified three important symmetries .",
    "our aim is to calculate the energy dispersion of the surface states for both models , for all possible nonequivalent surfaces perpendicular to @xmath21- , @xmath22- , and @xmath18-directions , and for the corresponding directions of the exchange field . in this way",
    "we will determine all possible types of surface states that can appear in a 3dti in a ferromagnetic exchange field .",
    "for all cases we will present numerical calculations based on an exact diagonalization of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) on a finite size lattice of dimension @xmath62 .",
    "periodical boundary conditions are employed parallel to the surface with 500 @xmath63-modes in both directions , while open boundary conditions are used perpendicular to the surface on 200 real space points .",

    "we will check our results using the topological winding number proposed by matsuura et al @xcite .",
    "in total we find that we need to consider seven nonequivalent cases : for model ii the spin - orbit coupling in @xmath18-direction is of the same type as in @xmath21- and @xmath22-direction .",
    "for that reason it is sufficient to study a single boundary direction , which we choose to be a @xmath22-boundary , i.e. a boundary with @xmath65  const . as regards the direction of the exchange field we have to distinguish two nonequivalent cases here : parallel and perpendicular to the surface , i.e. @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast , for model i we have five nonequivalent cases . for model i",
    "the spin - orbit coupling in @xmath18-direction is of a different type than in @xmath21- and @xmath22-direction , but the in - plane coupling is still isotropic .",
    "therefore we need to distinguish a @xmath18-boundary and a @xmath22-boundary . for the @xmath18-boundary",
    "there are again two nonequivalent directions for the exchange field : @xmath66 and @xmath68 .",
    "for the @xmath22-boundary , however , all field directions are nonequivalent and we have three cases here .",
    "we will see that among these seven cases there are three in which flat surface bands appear .",
    "one dimensional flat bands are found for model ii with @xmath22-boundary and exchange field in @xmath21-direction as well as for model i with @xmath22-boundary and exchange field in @xmath18-direction .",
    "a two dimensional flat band is found for model i with @xmath22-boundary and exchange field in @xmath21-direction .",
    "in this section we discuss the five nonequivalent cases for the particle - hole symmetric model i. we start with the more interesting case of a @xmath22-boundary .      in this case with @xmath70 the bulk energy bands eq .",
    "( [ eq : model1bulk ] ) simplify to the following expression : @xmath71 in the absence of an exchange field this band structure usually possesses a gap , because @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 do not become zero simultaneously .",
    "thus , the system is insulating .",
    "however , the gap closes when @xmath69 reaches a critical value @xmath76 , which is derived in appendix i and is of the order of @xmath32 .",
    "the fermi surface at zero energy is then defined by the two equations @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "these two equations define a line in three dimensional @xmath79 space .",
    "therefore the fermi surface is one - dimensional and the system has entered a semimetallic state . if one looks at the @xmath11 point @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 it is clear that the semimetallic state is entered at @xmath83 or closely below .",

    "<S> we study the properties of the surface states in three - dimensional topological insulators in the presence of a ferromagnetic exchange field . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that for layered materials like bi@xmath0se@xmath1 the surface states on the top surface behave qualitatively different than the surface states at the side surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the group velocity of the surface states can be tuned by the direction and strength of the exchange field . </S>",
    "<S> if the exchange field becomes larger than the bulk gap of the material , a phase transition into a topologically nontrivial semimetallic state occurs . in particular , the material becomes a weyl semimetal , if the exchange field possesses a non - zero component perpendicular to the layers . </S>",
    "<S> associated with the weyl semimetallic state we show that fermi arcs appear at the surface . under certain circumstances either one - dimensional or even two - dimensional surface flat bands can appear . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the appearence of these flat bands is related to chiral symmetries of the system and can be understood in terms of topological winding numbers . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous systems that have been suggested to possess surface flat bands , the present system has a much larger energy scale , allowing the observation of surface flat bands at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the flat bands are tunable in the sense that they can be turned on or off by rotation of the ferromagnetic exchange field . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are supported by both numerical results on a finite system as well as approximate analytical results . </S>"
