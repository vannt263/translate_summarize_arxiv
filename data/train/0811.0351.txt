    "these limits are found from the equations for the @xmath0-functions of the lattice hierarchies by subsituting an asymptotic expansion for the logarithm of the @xmath0-functions in the small @xmath6 limit .",
    "we also describe the connection of the @xmath0-functions of these hierarchies with the partition functions of the unitary , orthogonal , and symplectic ensembles of random matrix models with the matrix size @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) related to @xmath9 ( see for examples @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the asymptotic expansions of the free energy , the logarithm of the partition functions , as the size of the matrices approaches infinity satisfy the underlying assumption for the asymptotic expansion of the logarithm of the @xmath0-functions of the toda and pfaff lattice hierarchies .",
    "then the leading order terms of the asymptotic expansions satisfy the dispersionless toda and pfaff lattice hierarchies , which are written in terms of the two - point functions denoted by @xmath1 ( see for examples @xcite ) .",
    "there is a rich literature dealing with dispersionless integrable systems including the kp and toda lattice hierarchies , which mainly involve studying algebraic and complex analytic aspects of the equations and/or discussing applications to 2-dimensional topological field theories ( see , for examples , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it seems that there is no paper which connects directly the dispersionless integrable systems with combinatorial problems associated with random matrix ensembles .",
    "the present paper is to deal with this connection for combinatorial problems such as counting ribbon graphs on a compact surface of genus zero , and give a universality result for the dispersionless integrable systems which is an analogue of that for the random matrix ensembles .",
    "the toda lattice equation ( the first member of the toda lattice hierarchy ) is given by @xmath10 \\displaystyle{\\frac{\\partial b_n}{\\partial t_1}}&=a_n - a_{n-1}\\ , .",

    "a ribbon graph is a one complex embedded on an oriented genus @xmath88 surface , such that the complement of the complex is a disjoint collection of sets homeomorphic to discs .",
