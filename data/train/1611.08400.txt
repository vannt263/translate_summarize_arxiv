    "one can then define the _",
    "nondeterministic communication complexity _ simply as @xmath20 @xcite .    in combinatorial optimization ,",
    "one wants to lower bound the nondeterministic communication complexity of functions which are defined based on relations between feasible points and inequality constraints of the optimization problem at hand : alice has an inequality constraint , bob has a feasible point , and they should reject ( answer  0 ) if the point satisfies the inequality with equality .",

    "@xmath32    in this situation , the nondeterministic communication complexity lower bounds the logarithm of the so - called _ extension complexity : _ the smallest number of linear inequalities which is needed to formulate the optimization problem .",
    "this relationship goes back to yannakakis 1991 paper  @xcite , and has recently been the focus of renewed attention @xcite and a source of some breakthrough results @xcite .",

    ", we fix @xmath34 , and , we take @xmath35 , @xmath36 , to be independent bernoulli random variables with parameter @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath37 with probability  @xmath38 and @xmath39 with probability  @xmath40 .    in communication complexity , it is customary to determine these parameters up to within a constant factor of the number of bits , but in applications , this is often not accurate enough .",
    "e.g. , the above question about the extension complexity of the minimum - spanning - tree polytope asks where in the range between @xmath41 bits and @xmath42 bits the nondeterministic communication complexity lies .",
    "( here @xmath43 should taken as @xmath44 . ) therefore , in our analyses , we focus on the constant factors in our communication complexity bounds .      in core ( communication ) complexity theory , random functions are usually used for establishing that hard functions exist in the given model of computation . in this spirit , some easy results about the ( nondeterministic ) communication complexity of random functions and related parameters exist , with @xmath38 a constant , mostly @xmath45 ( e.g. , the fooling set bound is determined in this setting in @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to this , in applications , the density of the matrices is typically close to  1 , e.g. , in combinatorial optimization , the number of 0s in a `` row '' @xmath46 , is very often polylog of  @xmath43 .",
    "this makes necessary to look at these parameters in the spirit of the study of properties of random graph where @xmath47 with @xmath48 . in an analogy to the fields of random graphs ,",
    "the results become both considerably more interesting and also more difficult that way .",
    "the random parameters we analyze have been studied in other fields beside communication complexity .",
    "recently , izhakian , janson , and rhodes  @xcite have determined asymptotically the triangular rank of random boolean matrices with independent bernoulli entries .",
    "the triangular rank is itself important in communication complexity  @xcite ( and its applications  @xcite ) , and it is a lower bound to the size of a fooling set . in that paper ,",
    "determining the behavior for @xmath49 is posed as an open problem .",
    "the size of the largest monochromatic rectangle in a random bernoulli matrix was determined in  @xcite when  @xmath38 is bounded away from 0 and  1 , but their technique fails for @xmath50 .",
    "the nondeterministic communication complexity of a the clique - vs - stable set problem on random graphs was studied in @xcite .",
    "the parameters we study in this paper are of importance beyond communication complexity and its direct applications . in combinatorics ,",
    "e.g. , the cover number coincides with strong isometric dimension of graphs  @xcite , and has connections to extremal set theory and coding theory  @xcite .",

    "consequently , determining these parameters could be thought of as analyzing a certain type of random graphs",
