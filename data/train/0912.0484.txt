    "the development of quasi one - dimensional waveguides for cold atoms based on optical lattices @xcite and atom chips @xcite has lead to a number of theoretical investigations on the guided quasi - stationary and dynamical transport properties of ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "particular attention was devoted to the transport of coherent bosonic matter waves through quantum - dot potentials realized , e.g. , by two ( magnetic or optical ) barriers along the waveguide , which display nonlinear transmission features that are reminiscent from nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "an important long - term aim in this context is to establish a close analogy with _",
    "conduction through microfabricated structures and nanostructures in solid - state systems .",
    "this latter field of research still exhibits a number of open questions especially related to the quantitative role of interaction and correlation between the electrons in such mesoscopic transport processes .    in spite of remarkable advancements in the creation of one - dimensional matter - wave beams through guided atom lasers @xcite ,",
    "the experimental realization and evaluation of such one - dimensional atomic scattering processes still represents a formidable task .",
    "it makes therefore sense to consider alternative approaches based on _ closed _ systems , where two reservoirs of ultracold atoms are connected to each other and biased such that a flow of atoms can take place from one reservoir to the other .",
    "atomic quantum dots across which the atoms have to tunnel could be implemented by inducing small potential wells in between the reservoirs .",
    "such geometries were studied in recent investigations on transistor - like operations with bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "the quantification of `` conduction '' across such a quantum dot under a small bias , however , requires a precise measurement of atomic populations ideally on a single - atom level , which is not impossible @xcite but seems rather hard to be realized in this specific context .",
    "a solution to the problem of counting individual atoms was recently provided by experiments with optical double - well lattices , focusing on correlated two - particle tunneling @xcite as well as on the interaction blockade  @xcite with three particles @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "each double - well site was identically prepared with a well - defined number of atoms and finally `` read out '' by absorption imaging after time - of - flight expansion , where the populations in the left and right wells were , before switching off the lattices , transferred to different brillouin zones .",
    "this parallel processing of identical few - particle experiments especially allowed for the detection of integer atomic populations in each of the two wells per site @xcite , as a consequence of the strong repulsive interaction between the atoms . more recently",
    ", much theoretical work has focused on the tunneling of bosons in such double well potentials , see for example @xcite .    inspired by the basic idea sketched above , we now propose here to investigate source - drain transport processes with ultracold atoms on the basis of optical _ triple - well _ lattices , which could possibly be realized by adding another standing - wave beam with the appropriate wavelength to the experimental setup in refs .  @xcite .",
    "if all three lattice potentials that together form the triple - well lattice are imposed with about the same amplitude and with a suitable phase shift relative to each other , a triple - well potential can be created on each site where the two outer wells are considerably larger than the inner one .",
    "after loading the lattice with a well - defined number of atoms per site , these outer wells can be regarded as microscopic `` source '' and `` drain '' reservoirs , while the central well acts as an atomic quantum dot .",
    "we now use this general configuration in this paper in order to study the atomic analog of _ coulomb blockade _ in electron transport ( see for example @xcite and the review @xcite ) in the conduction of strongly interacting bosonic atoms from the source to the drain across the dot region .",
    "we consider , to this end , a time - dependent ramping process of a bias between the outer wells , which can be implemented by varying the amplitude and phase of the main ( longest - wavelength ) component of the triple - well lattice , and address the question to which extent this ramping process leads to the transfer of one or several atoms from the source reservoir to the dot or from there to the drain reservoir .",
    "while this perturbation represents the analog of a `` bias voltage '' in electronic quantum dots , a `` gate voltage '' , which lowers the on - site eigenenergies of the central well relative to the outer ones , can be induced in a very similar manner , again by a suitable manipulation of the main laser beam of the lattice .",
    "our aim is to map out the lines of finite `` conductance '' , i.e.  of a finite transfer of atoms between the wells , in the parameter space spanned by the above - mentioned gate and bias voltages .",
    "we shall show that this gives rise to diamond - like structures that are closely analogous to coulomb diamonds in electronic quantum dots .",
    "we start in section [ sec : system ] with a detailed description of the triple - well system under consideration , which is defined in accordance with the experimental setups used in refs .",
    "section [ sec : static ] is devoted to the discussion of the `` static '' interaction blockade in the triple - well system in perfect analogy with the double - well interaction blockade experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : transport ] , we discuss the outcome of the time - dependent ramping process , which is numerically computed both through diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian as well as through the propagation of the many - body wavefunction under the variation of the bias .",
    "the resulting diamond structures are explained within a simple bose - hubbard model and compared with electronic coulomb diamonds .",
    "we finally discuss the relevant energy scales of this transport process and point out possible implications for future research in the conclusion .",
    "we consider a gas of ultracold @xmath0rb atoms in a quasi one - dimensional confinement that is exposed to a periodic potential of the form @xmath1 this potential can be generated by a superposition of three counter - propagating laser beams with the wavelengths @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "we specifically consider the wavelengths @xmath5 nm and @xmath6 nm , which were also used in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite , and assume for the third laser beam the wavelength @xmath7 nm .",
    "the latter could possibly be realized by a frequency - doubling of the laser beam with the wavelength @xmath8 or , alternatively , by retro - reflecting a part of this laser beam ( split with an acousto - optical deflector ) under a finite angle of @xmath9 as done in ref .",
    "@xcite . using suitable phase shifts between these three counterpropagating laser beams ( and taking into account the fact that the wavelength @xmath10 is red - detuned",
    "while the wavelengths @xmath8 , @xmath11 are blue - detuned with respect to the intra - atomic transition in @xmath0rb ) , we thereby obtain the effective potential @xmath12 with positive prefactors @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , which apart from a constant offset is exactly equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) provided we choose @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . in this way",
    ", we obtain , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , a periodic lattice of sites with triple - well potentials , where on each site the two outer wells are deeper than the central well .    the confinement to one spatial direction",
    "is assumed to be ensured by the presence of a strong two - dimensional ( red - detuned ) optical lattice in the transverse spatial directions , described by the effective potential @xmath19 .",
    "this gives rise to a lattice of harmonic waveguides parallel to the @xmath20-axis with the confinement frequency @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the mass of a @xmath0rb atom .",
    "as was shown by olshanii @xcite , the effective one - dimensional interaction strength along these waveguides is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 nm is the @xmath26-wave scattering length for @xmath0rb atoms and @xmath27 denotes the transverse oscillator length .",
    "obviously , a rather large value for @xmath28 is generally required in order to induce strong interactions along the one - dimensional confinement .",
    "setting , as in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite , the wavelength of the transverse laser beams to @xmath29 nm , we obtain the one - dimensional interaction strength @xmath30 if we choose @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the transverse recoil energy .    , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ( upper panel ) are superimposed according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) to form a superlattice ( middle panel ) .",
    "the lower panel displays the resulting triple - well potential on an individual site of the superlattice ( for @xmath35 ) .",
    "the dashed lines mark the unperturbed single - particle energies in the wells , and the solid lines indicate the chemical potential , or , more precisely , the particle - removal energy of an individual atom for the six - particle ground state where three atoms are localized in the left as well as in the right well .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ]    we shall in the following consider also a large amplitude of the longitudinal triple - well lattice and set , for the sake of definiteness , the prefactor @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) to @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( corresponding to @xmath39 khz ) is the recoil energy of the laser with the wavelength @xmath8 . for this particular choice of the lattice strength , and for @xmath40 ,",
    "the energetically lowest single - particle eigenstates within each triple - well site are strongly localized in the wells .",
    "a rather small splitting @xmath41 of the ground - state doublet , consisting of the positive and negative linear combination of the `` wannier states '' ( or quasi - modes ) in which the atom is localized around the center of the left and right well , respectively , is thereby obtained , corresponding to a tunneling time scale of the order of @xmath42ms .",
    "this splitting is much smaller than the level spacing between the ground - state doublet and the doublet containing an excited state in one of the wells , which is roughly characterized by the local harmonic - oscillator energy @xmath43 within the well .",
    "tunneling between _ adjacent _ triple - well sites is neglected in the following , as the associated inter - site tunneling time exceeds all other relevant time scales of this system .",
    "we therefore consider the dynamics within the individual triple - well sites to be completely independent of each other .",
    "in addition to the `` main '' triple - well lattice characterized by the amplitude @xmath36 , we introduce in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) two independent perturbations with the amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 which can be controlled by a suitable manipulation of the laser beam with the largest wavelength @xmath10 . in close analogy with coulomb blockade experiments in electronic quantum dots , we name @xmath44 the `` gate voltage '' and @xmath45 the `` bias voltage '' .",
    "indeed , as for electronic quantum dots , the effect of increasing @xmath44 is to lower the energetic offset of the central well with respect to the outer ones , which allows one to enhance the ground - state population of this well in the many - body system . a positive bias voltage @xmath45 , on the other hand , gives rise to an overall tilt of the triple - well configuration , which opens the possibility for a transfer of individual atoms from the left to the central or from the central to the right well .    in lowest order",
    ", the impact of the gate and bias voltages @xmath44 and @xmath45 can approximately be quantified by the shifts @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , of the single - particle energies @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 in the left , central , and right well , respectively .",
    "this result is obtained by a simple perturbative consideration where the matrix elements of the gate and bias perturbations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) are evaluated within the local ground states in the wells , which are approximated by gaussian wavefunctions centred around @xmath52 for the central and around @xmath53 for the right and left well .",
    "using @xmath54 as local oscillator frequency and @xmath55 , we obtain @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that the gate and bias `` voltages '' directly correspond here to the associated energy shifts in the individual wells .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the superlattice is initially loaded with an ultracold gas of @xmath0rb atoms , such that each of the triple - well sites is populated with a given well - defined number of atoms . in the experiment of ref .  @xcite which used a double - well lattice , interaction blockade was measured by detecting the ground - state populations in the left and right wells as a function of a finite bias between the wells . for this purpose ,",
    "the population in the left well was transferred into a highly excited state within the double - well potential by means of a rather fast increase of the bias ; this allows to separately detect it through time - of - flight expansion and subsequent absorption imaging after switching off the optical lattices ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a step - like structure , with plateaus at integer values , was found for the population in the left and right wells as a function of the bias @xcite , which is a clear consequence of the strong repulsive interaction between the atoms .    .",
    "the calculation was done for the gate voltages @xmath58 ( upper panel ) , for which the central well is practically empty , and for @xmath59 ( lower panel ) , for which the central well contains one atom at not too strong bias . due to the strong repulsive interaction between the atoms ,",
    "the populations in the wells undergo step - like transitions between plateaus at integer values under the variation of the potential , in close analogy with interaction blockade in double - well lattices @xcite .",
    "[ fig : groundstates ] ]    this programme can be carried out as well for our triple - well configuration .",
    "figure [ fig : groundstates ] shows , as a function of the bias voltage @xmath45 , the populations in the left , central , and right well that is contained in the many - body ground state of six particles per triple - well site . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the populations undergo rather sharp , step - like transitions between plateaus at integer values , which clearly underlines the relevance of the strong repulsive interaction between the atoms .",
    "while the central well remains practically empty at the gate voltage @xmath60 , it is populated with one atom at @xmath61 provided the bias is not too strong .",
    "this scenario can straightforwardly be generalized to stronger gate voltages that would allow for two or more atoms in the central well .",
    "decreasing the interaction strength will lead to a decrease of the bias voltage interval in which the sequence of transitions takes place , until in the limit of vanishing interaction this sequence shrinks down to a collective transition from a fully left - biased state , with all atoms in the left well , at negative to a fully right - biased state at positive bias voltages .",
    "an infinitely large interaction strength @xmath62 will , on the other hand , not give rise to an infinite interaction energy within the wells and to an infinite extent of the plateaus , but rather approach the case of noninteracting spinless _ fermionic _",
    "atoms @xcite where the pauli exclusion principle is responsible for the appearance of plateaus and step - like transitions in the populations .",
    "the many - body ground states were calculated by means of an exact diagonalization approach based on the lanczos algorithm @xcite , which takes into account all fock states with a given total number of particles that are defined upon a suitably truncated single - particle basis .",
    "we chose as basis functions the plane waves @xmath63 that satisfy periodic boundary conditions within the triple - well lattice , and took into account for the many - body calculation all @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "we verified that for six particles this truncation is sufficient to reproduce all relevant features of the many - body states under consideration . after calculating the ground state and its many - body eigenfunction ,",
    "the populations in the individual wells are computed by integrating the spatial atomic density in between ( artificial ) separation points at the local maxima of the triple - well potential .",
    "the population in the left well is thus obtained as the integral over the density from @xmath66 to the position of the left local maximum ( at @xmath67 for @xmath35 ) , while the population in the central well is given by the integral over the density in between the left and right maxima .    with few exceptions ( occuring notably at near - degeneracies between the energies of different many - body states )",
    ", we almost always obtain nearly integer well populations for the eigenstates , due to the strong repulsive interaction between the atoms .",
    "we shall therefore denote these eigenstates by @xmath68:@xmath69:@xmath70 in the following , where the integers @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 represent the populations in the left , central , and right well , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the double - well potential , the confinement ( [ eq : potential ] ) permits to probe interaction blockade not only in the `` static '' properties of the many - body ground state , but also in the dynamical _ transport _ behaviour of the system under the variation of the bias .",
    "we assume for this purpose that the triple - well lattice is initially loaded with a given number of atoms at a given gate voltage @xmath44 and at vanishing bias @xmath71 .",
    "the bias voltage is then _ dynamically ramped _ from zero to a given maximal value on a suitable time scale . after this ramping process",
    ", the population in the individual wells is measured by a suitable transfer of the atoms to excited modes , time - of - flight expansion , and absorption imaging @xcite .",
    "the speed of this ramping has to be chosen such that is is slow with respect to the tunneling time scale between adjacent wells ( i.e. , between the left and central well , or between the central and right well ) , but fast with respect to `` direct '' tunneling between the left and right well .",
    "more quantitatively , considering a linear ramping process of the form @xmath72 with constant speed @xmath26 , and taking into account that the shift of the single - particle energy in the left or right well with respect to the central well is approximately given by @xmath45 ( as pointed out in section [ sec : system ] ) , the landau - zener theory for nonadiabatic transitions @xcite predicts the probability @xmath73 \\label{eq : lz}\\ ] ] for the transfer of an atom at an avoided crossing between the state @xmath68:@xmath69:@xmath70 and the state @xmath74:@xmath75:@xmath70 ( or @xmath68:@xmath76:@xmath77 ) , where @xmath78 denotes the level splitting between the hybridized states right at the anticrossing .",
    "if we denote by @xmath79 the analogous level splitting between @xmath68:@xmath69:@xmath70 and @xmath74:@xmath69:@xmath77 , corresponding to the transfer of an atom across both barriers , we obtain the requirement that the speed @xmath26 of the ramping process would have to satisfy @xmath80 .",
    "( upper left panel ) , which is then exposed to a time - dependent sweep of the bias voltage from @xmath71 to @xmath81 with the constant speed @xmath82 .",
    "the upper panels show the potential ( above , in black ) and the spatial atom densities ( below , in red ) for the bias voltages @xmath71 ( left panel ) , @xmath83 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath81 ( right panel ) .",
    "the lower panel illustrates the evolution of this time - dependent ramping process in the many - body spectrum ( energies are in units of @xmath84 ) .",
    "we compute for this purpose the decomposition of the time - dependent many - body wavefunction into the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and represent the relative weight of this decomposition by the size of the circles . clearly , the system undergoes a nearly perfect transition from the 3:0:3 to the 2:1:3 state at the avoided crossing at @xmath85 , and is nearly not affected by the previous anticrossing between the 3:0:3 and 2:0:4 states at @xmath86 .",
    "[ fig : tilt ] ]    in the spirit of this consideration , the outcome of this time - dependent ramping process can be predicted by computing not only the ground state , but also lowly excited states of the many - body system as a function of the bias voltage .",

    "[ fig : tilt ] shows the result of such a numerical calculation , which was done for six particles at the gate voltage @xmath58 . in accordance with fig .",
    "[ fig : groundstates ] , we recognize that the state with the populations 3:0:3 , which is the energetically lowest state at zero bias , undergoes a small anticrossing with the 2:0:4 state at @xmath86 , which then represents the new ground state beyond that value of the bias voltage .",
    "the level splitting at this anticrossing is found to be @xmath87 , which is much smaller than the subsequent splitting @xmath88 between the levels of the 3:0:3 and the 2:1:3 states .",
    "consequently , a ramping process @xmath89 with , e.g. , the constant speed @xmath90 , altogether taking place within a time interval of @xmath91 ms , will provide the desired atom transfer from the left to the central well .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by a truly time - dependent simulation of the ramping process .",
    "we use for this purpose a variant of the lanczos algorithm @xcite , which involves the creation of a finite krylov subspace that contains the most relevant components describing the time derivative of the wavefunction to be propagated . within short time",
    "intervals @xmath92 , a numerically precise propagation is carried out in this krylov subspace , utilizing the representation of both the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian and the time - dependent perturbation within this subspace @xcite . in between those time intervals ,",
    "the krylov subspace is recreated using the `` new '' wavefunction that results from this propagation step . in practice",
    ", we find good convergence using 100 krylov vectors and the time step @xmath93 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt ] shows the result of such a time - dependent calculation for a ramping process of the bias voltage with the speed @xmath90 from @xmath71 to @xmath81 . to illustrate the evolution in the many - body spectrum ,",
    "we compute here at regular intervals in time the overlap matrix elements of the wavefunction with the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian . this decomposition",
    "is then represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt ] by circles whose sizes are directly proportional to the square moduli of those matrix elements .",
    "we basically see that the time - dependent wavefunction is , at almost all considered bias voltages , essentially described by one single eigenstate of the hamiltonian , namely the one that exhibits the populations 3:0:3 before and 2:1:3 after the avoided crossing at @xmath85 .",
    "the small anticrossing between the 3:0:3 and the 2:0:4 states at @xmath86 , on the other hand , is almost completely `` ignored '' by the time - dependent wavefunction , which undergoes a _",
    "transition across this anticrossing ( in contrast to the adiabatic transition at @xmath85 ) .",
    "until which the time - dependent ramping process ( symbolized by the vertical arrrows ) has to be performed in order to achieve single - atom transfer between adjacent wells .",
    "the circles mark the gate voltages for which numerical calculations , based on the computation of the many - body spectrum , were explicitly carried out .",

    "( [ eq : crossing ] ) , which is proportional to their level splitting .",
    "note that the avoided crossings become larger with larger @xmath44 , which corresponds to the fact that the barrier height between the outer wells and the central well is lowered by increasing the gate voltage .",
    "[ fig : diamonds ] ]    this calculation can be carried out for other gate voltages as well .",

    "the starting configuration depends on the gate voltage under consideration . for @xmath95 , we start with a 3:0:3 population at zero bias , which is then transformed into a 2:1:3 state under the increase of @xmath45 , and into a 3:1:2 state if instead the bias is ramped into the opposite direction leading to negative @xmath45 . within @xmath96 , the initial state either corresponds to a 2:1:3 or to a 3:1:2 population , depending on the presence of a tiny positive or negative bias .",
    "the final state of the ramping process depends now on the gate voltage . for @xmath97",
    ", we obtain the 2:0:4 state ( or the 4:0:2 state for negative bias ) , i.e.  the atom in the central well is released to the right ( left ) well , while for @xmath98 another atom from the left ( right ) well is pulled into the central well leading to the 1:2:3 ( 3:2:1 ) state .",

    "this is in fairly good agreement with the numerically computed interaction energy @xmath139 , which is obtained by substracting twice the lowest single - particle eigenenergy @xmath140 of the central well from the energy of the lowest two - particle state where both electrons are localized in the central well .",
    "while this simple bose - hubbard - type model is capable of reproducing the location of the transition lines for single - atom transfer in the @xmath44@xmath45 parameter space , it is _ not _ sufficient to predict the time scales on which the ramping process ought to take place in order to achieve those transitions .",
    "as pointed out above , these time scales crucially depend on the sizes of the avoided crossings in the many - body spectrum , which are essentially given by the single - particle hopping matrix elements between different wells .",
    "these hopping matrix elements , however , arise from a tunneling process across the barriers that separate the wells from each other .",
    "they are therefore sensitively depending on the effective _ height _ of the barriers with respect to the particle - addition or -removal energies under consideration , which in turn is appreciably modified under variation of the bias or gate voltages .    specifically , we find that an increase of the gate voltage , corresponding to `` pulling down '' the central well with respect to the outer ones , generally gives rise to a significant enlargement of the avoided crossings between different many - body levels .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamonds ] in which the size of the circles indicate the extent @xmath94 of the avoided crossings between the states under consideration in bias voltage space .",
    "more precisely , if we describe the general dependence of the level splitting between two near - degenerate states on the bias voltage by @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 denote the splitting and bias voltage , respectively , at the crossing point and @xmath144 represents the ( nearly integer ) difference between the variations of the unperturbed levels with @xmath45 far away from the anticrossing .",
    "we define @xmath145 as the maximal extent of the avoided crossing in bias voltage space . for anticrossings that correspond to single - atom transfer between adjacent wells",
    ", we have @xmath146 and therefore @xmath147 .",
    ". level splittings ( in units of @xmath84 ) of the first two avoided crossings that are encountered during the ramping process of the bias voltage , for @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 . [",
    "tab : splittings ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ tab : splittings ] lists the level splittings at the avoided crossings that the system undergoes during the time - dependent ramping process , for the gate voltages @xmath58 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 . for each of those gate voltages ,",
    "the first one of the encountered anticrossings corresponds to a double - barrier tunneling process of an atom which is directly transferred from the left to the right well .",
    "correspondingly , the associated anticrossing is much smaller than the one of the second anticrossing describing a single - barrier tunneling process .",
    "this particularly implies that it is , for all of these cases , possible to define , according to the landau - zener formula ( [ eq : lz ] ) , a reasonably large range of speeds @xmath26 for the ramping process @xmath72 , such that the system undergoes a diabatic transition across the first and an adiabatic transition at the second anticrossing .",
    "comparing , however , the level splittings for _ different _ values of @xmath44 , we realize that this range of speeds will depend on the particular gate voltage under consideration , and that it is hardly possible to choose one `` universal '' ramping speed with which the desired single - atom transfer can be carried out for all gate voltages .",
    "this is another specification of the microscopic nature of this transport system .",
    "the size of the hopping matrix elements do also play a role for the question to which extent the interaction - blockade phenomena discussed here are also observable for lower effective one - dimensional interaction strengths @xmath62 , i.e.  in the presence of a weaker transverse confinement of the waveguide .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] seems to affirm this , as the structure of the diamonds does not explicitly depend on the interaction strength , except for the scaling of the horizontal and vertical axes which is directly proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "however , the size and extent of the relevant avoided crossings , on the other hand , does , in lowest order , _ not _ scale with @xmath62 , as they are essentially given by the single - particle hopping matrix element between adjacent sites .",
    "this implies that decreasing the effective interaction strength @xmath62 , e.g. , by a factor ten will , in lowest order , give rise to the same relative location of the transition lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamonds ] , with the @xmath44 and @xmath45 axes scaled down by a factor ten , while the `` uncertainty '' of the transition lines , given by the extent of the corresponding avoided crossings and represented by the size of the circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamonds ] , will be increased by a factor ten .",
    "the interaction - blockade diamonds ultimately become unobservable if the on - site interaction energy is of the same order as the tunneling matrix element between adjacent sites , in which case _ collective _ instead of single - atom transfer processes begin to take place .",
    "this underlines again the obvious requirement that the transport processes discussed here have to be performed in the `` mott - insulator regime '' of strong on - site interaction and weak tunneling within the triple - well potential .",
    "in summary , we studied a microscopic analog of source - drain transport with ultracold bosonic atoms in a triple - well potential .",
    "the latter is considered to be realized by optical triple - well lattices in analogy with the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite , which are initially loaded with a well - defined number of atoms per site .",
    "we propose to perform then a time - dependent tilt of these triple - well potentials until a given maximal bias , followed by measuring the resulting populations in the individual wells .",
    "this process can be repeated for various values of a `` gate voltage '' which lowers the level of the central well with respect to the outer ones .",
    "diamond structures are obtained for the transition lines that mark the necessary values for the bias in order to achieve single - atom transfer between adjacent wells , when being plotted as a function of that gate voltage .",
    "these diamonds can be used to infer the local interaction energy in the central well .",
    "there are striking similarities with coulomb diamonds in electronic quantum dots , but also some important differences to the latter , which mainly arise due to the microscopic nature of the `` reservoirs '' in the outer two wells .",
    "most characteristically , `` transport '' is manifested not by a continuos flow of particles across the quantum dot , but rather by the transfer of a single atom from one well to another .",
    "this transport process is , in general , not `` completed '' insofar as the atom when , e.g. , being transferred from the left to the central well will not directly go on to the right well , due to the mismatch of the corresponding particle - addition and -removal energies .",
    "close to the corners of the diamond structures ( e.g.  at @xmath151 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : diamonds ] ) , this latter task can eventually be achieved by further increasing the bias . in general , however , more complicated ramping processes , involving also a time - dependent variation of the gate voltage , would be required for that purpose .",
    "this is clearly a consequence of the finite two - body interaction energy in the reservoirs , which also leads to a striking asymmetry between diamond structures corresponding to balanced and unbalanced populations in the outer wells .",
    "the microscopic transport scheme that we investigated here can be applied as well to more complex atomic gases involving , e.g. , several spin components and/or long - range dipolar interaction .",
    "this will open various possibilities for the exploration of the interplay of interaction and transport in an experimentally feasible context .",
    "our findings should , moreover , be relevant for for cyclic processes  @xcite as well as for the evaluation of the feasibility of atomtronic scenarios and atomic transistors @xcite and might provide valuable insight for the design of logical operations with single atoms .",
