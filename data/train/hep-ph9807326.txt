    "although quantum chromodynamics has long been accepted as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , the spectrum of hadrons composed of light quarks still poses many unanswered questions . even below 1 gev ,",
    "the old controversy on the existence of the @xmath4 meson , an isospin-0 scalar boson strongly coupled to the @xmath0 system , remains unanswered .",
    "recently , there have been some renewed interests in this problem both theoretically   and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "some analyses favor the existence of @xmath4 .",
    "the particle reappeared in the 1996 edition of `` review of particle physics '' ( particle data book )  @xcite as `` @xmath5(4001200 ) or @xmath4 '' after an absence for more than two decades , though it is cautiously stated that `` the interpretation of this entry as a particle is controversial . ''",
    "there is no good agreement on its mass among the recent studies .",
    "for example , trnqvist and roos  @xcite have used a `` unitarized quark model '' to fit the meson - meson @xmath6 wave amplitudes and claimed the existence of a very broad @xmath4 with a mass of @xmath7 mev .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite fit the @xmath0 @xmath6 wave amplitudes to an @xmath6 matrix model and find the @xmath4 mass of @xmath8 mev .",
    "although these results seem conclusive within their frameworks , the disagreement of the derived @xmath4 mass may imply that quantitative conclusions are quite model dependent , casting some doubt in the very existence of @xmath4 . in any case",
    ", it is not easy to assess how model - independent are their conclusions .    in this paper , we look at this problem from a somewhat different point of view .",
    "we try to minimize the necessary model assumptions by a simple approach which only assumes the chiral flavor symmetry and general constraints on the amplitudes such as analyticity , unitarity , and crossing symmetry .",
    "we notice that crossing symmetry is not taken into account in the recent works discussed above .    as we put more emphasis on theoretical transparency than aiming at a perfect fit to the data , we concentrate on @xmath0 scattering below 1 gev and work in the chiral limit with massless pions .",
    "since the pions are the goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken @xmath9 symmetry , the form of the pion interactions is tightly constrained at low energies by the symmetry . if we expand the @xmath0 elastic scattering amplitude around @xmath10 , chiral symmetry demands the amplitude vanishes at @xmath10 and the linear terms in @xmath11 , @xmath12 are determined in terms of the pion decay constant @xmath13 .",
    "these and terms in higher order in @xmath11 , @xmath12 can be described systematically if one uses the machinery of the chiral lagrangian .    although this expansion around the origin gives a good description of the amplitude at low energies , it breaks down when one approaches the mass of the lowest - lying hadrons ( resonances ) other than pions .",
    "these resonances manifest themselves as a pole on the second sheet in the scattering amplitude .",
    "we are thus led to start with a simple form of the amplitude which has relevant poles ( corresponding to possible spin-0 isospin-0 @xmath4 and spin-1 isospin-1 @xmath3 resonances ) and has the behavior consistent with chiral symmetry ( low energy theorem ) .    if there is a resonance in the @xmath11 channel , the same resonance is also exchanged in the @xmath12 and @xmath14 channels because of crossing symmetry . in a study of strongly interacting higgs sector  @xcite we found that the crossed - channel exchange of a vector resonance has a large reflection in the @xmath2 partial wave . in most of the recent model studies of the @xmath4 meson ,",
    "this effect is not explicitly taken into consideration .",
    "it is one of the motivations of this work to assess the importance of the crossed channel @xmath3 exchange in the scalar channel .",
    "as we are concerned with the strong interaction , the amplitude constructed in this way tend to violate unitarity near the pole . to obtain a unitary amplitude",
    ", we first project to partial waves ( we will be concerned with @xmath2 and @xmath15 channels ) , and use the @xmath1 method to unitarize the partial wave amplitudes .",
    "this method gives amplitudes which has the correct analytic properties with cuts on the real axis . in this respect",
    ", it is superior to the @xmath16 matrix or pad unitarization scheme .",
    "although the procedure is not exactly crossing symmetric , the deviation from the symmetry is controlled and mostly limited to the region near the pole .    in section 2 ,",
    "we summarize the general characteristics of the @xmath0 elastic scattering amplitude and set up our chirally symmetric ` model - independent ' amplitude with possible poles .",
    "two simple cases , ` no @xmath4 ' and ` degenerate @xmath3@xmath4 ' are discussed in detail . in section 3 , we calculate the partial wave amplitudes from the invariant amplitudes in section 2 .",
    "unitarization of the amplitudes is performed using the @xmath1 method .",
    "relation of our method to the low - energy chiral expansion is clarified in section 4 . in section 5 , we determine the parameters in the amplitudes and compare them with the phase shift data .",
    "we summarize and conclude with some remarks in section 6 .",
    "the @xmath0 system has three independent isospin channels . in terms of mandelstam variables , the invariant amplitude for the process @xmath17 has the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , 2 , 3 are isospin indices ( with @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath11 is the c.m .",
    "energy squared , @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 denoting the c.m .",
    "scattering angle .",
    "note that @xmath27 .",
    "there is only one analytic function @xmath28 because of crossing symmetry .",
    "it satisfies @xmath29 due to bose symmetry . the last term in ( [ eqm ] )",
    "thus may be rewritten as @xmath30 .",
    "chiral symmetry low energy theorem demands that @xmath31 behaves near @xmath10 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "the structure of the second term will be discussed later .",
    "the expansion breaks down by the existence of a resonance .",
    "we expect that possible lowest - lying resonances are in @xmath34 and @xmath35 channels . in the narrow width approximation , the contribution of these resonances may be written @xmath36 for the scalar exchange ( we write @xmath11 in the numerator instead of a constant , to be consistent with the low energy theorem .",
    "this corresponds to adding a contact interaction like that in the @xmath4 model ) and @xmath37 for the vector exchange ( the numerator is the minimal dependence to assure spin 1 and has the same form as the gauge boson exchange ) .",
    "the tail of these exchange amplitude contributes to the slope of the amplitude at the origin .",
    "if we assume that these two resonances saturate the low energy theorem , we find @xmath38 this condition , applied to the electroweak symmetry breaking , has been used in our previous study of the strong @xmath39 scattering  @xcite , in which we have obtained partial wave amplitudes consistent with unitarity and analyticity . for hadron physics , it turns out that the condition is too strong to explain the observed width of the @xmath3 meson . even if one maximizes the vector coupling and includes the enhancing effect of unitarization , the resulting width is too small by @xmath40 .",
    "thus we are led to relax the condition ( [ eqsumlet ] ) to increase the @xmath41 coupling @xmath42 .",
    "this may be done by subtracting the @xmath43 part from the exchange amplitudes and add a suitable @xmath43 term to @xmath28 instead .",
    "this procedure gives @xmath44 at the lowest order , the @xmath3 width may be reproduced if one takes @xmath42 around the ksrf value  @xcite @xmath45 .",
    "the price to pay is the worse high energy behavior .    expanding ( [ eqap ] ) to second order ,",
    "we have @xmath46 this will be used later in matching with chiral lagrangian .    to assess the possible existence of @xmath4",
    ", we will compare the two cases ( 1 ) no @xmath4 ( @xmath3 only ) and ( 2 ) degenerate @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "we now discuss motivations for these choices .",
    "\\(1 ) _ no @xmath4 meson : _ in the nonrelativistic quark model , the lowest - lying @xmath6 wave mesons are pseudoscalar ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) and vector ( @xmath3 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "scalar mesons are @xmath50 wave states and are expected to have similar masses as the other @xmath50 wave states , the axial vector and tensor mesons which lie in the 12001300 mev range . as we will be concerned with the scattering amplitude below 1 gev ,",
    "such mesons in this mass range have small effect and we can simply take @xmath51 to illustrate this case . we may recall that the pion electromagnetic form factor is rather well described  @xcite by the hypothesis of @xmath3 dominance . the coupling of @xmath3 to pions given by the ksrf relation  @xcite @xmath52 reproduces the @xmath3 width quite well .",
    "\\(2 ) _ degenerate @xmath3@xmath4 : _ since the light quarks are essentially massless compared to the qcd scale , there is no reason that nonrelativistic quark model reliably describe the spectrum . in the string - type picture of hadrons ,",
    "the spectrum of the states has a tower structure and the vector meson is accompanied by a scalar daughter .",
    "this situation in the narrow width approximation is realized in the veneziano amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is also suggested in the framework of nonlinear realization of the @xmath53 chiral flavor symmetry developed by weinberg  @xcite .",
    "algebraization of the adler - weisberger sum rule results in the mass matrix structure with this degeneracy , again in the narrow width ( large @xmath54 ) limit . the couplings @xmath42 and @xmath55 are found to be equal and has the same strength as the ksrf coupling @xmath56    the veneziano amplitude also gives @xmath57 but the size of the coupling is different , as we will now discuss .",
    "the veneziano @xmath0 scattering amplitude takes a simpler form for the charge eigenstates @xmath58 . with the constraints of chiral symmetry",
    ", it reads  @xcite @xmath59 vanishing of the amplitude at @xmath10 demands that the intercept of the regge trajectory is @xmath60 , and the overall coefficient is determined by the scale of chiral symmetry breaking @xmath61 . the invariant amplitude @xmath31 is related to ( [ eqbfour ] ) by the relation @xmath62/2 $ ] .",
    "as is well known , the amplitude ( [ eqbfour ] ) has an infinite number of poles both in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 channels .",
    "the lowest - lying poles are at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , at which the amplitude behaves as @xmath65 expanding ( [ eqbfourpole ] ) in partial waves , one finds that a scalar and a vector state are degenerate at @xmath66 . the corresponding couplings are @xmath67 the chiral veneziano amplitude may be approximated by the form ( [ eqap ] ) with appropriate couplings and masses in the energy region of our interest , where the higher poles have small effect .",
    "the invariant amplitude can be expanded in terms of partial waves for states having definite isospin @xmath68 : @xmath69 with @xmath24 and    @xmath70    elastic unitarity requires @xmath71 and the amplitude can be written in terms of the phase shift @xmath72 as @xmath73 inelastic channels ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) are known to be negligible below the @xmath76 threshold  @xcite , in accordance with the expectation based on chiral symmetry ( the @xmath77 cross section starts at the order @xmath78 ) .",

    "( we note that more recent experiments on the @xmath4 meson utilize ` pomeron - pomeron ' scattering or @xmath175 annihilation . ) new experiments with more precision are clearly desirable .",
    "systematic uncertainties may also be reduced .",
    "in fact , the existing data involve some extrapolation because they are extracted from the reaction @xmath176",
    ". it would be much more welcome if direct beam - beam @xmath0 experiment can be done .",
