    "vii zw 403 is classified as a blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy .",
    "compact galaxies were first identified by @xcite as high surface brightness objects that were just distinguishable from stars on the palomar sky survey .",
    "this original classification included galaxies with a wide range of colors and total luminosities .",
    "later , @xcite presented a study of 115 blue compact dwarf galaxies , which they defined as low luminosity ( @xmath5 ) galaxies with a compact optical size ( @xmath6 kpc in diameter ) , that have optical spectra with `` strong sharp narrow emission lines superposed on a blue continuum . ''",
    "the last two properties were chosen to ensure that the objects in their study had dense regions with active star formation .",
    "it was shown early on that bcd galaxies could not have maintained such vigorous star formation for long periods of time @xcite , so such activity must be episodic .",
    "the cause of this activity is unclear . unlike spiral galaxies , triggering mechanisms such as spiral density waves and shear are not present in dwarf galaxies , which tend to be slow , mostly solid - body rotators .",
    "gravitational instabilities in the gas , which work well to predict the location of star formation in large galaxies , seem to work differently in dwarfs , where the average gas density is typically below the critical @xcite value by a factor of 2 or 3 , and yet , stars still form .",
    "@xcite showed that the nature of the  regions in bcds are not that different from those in ims ; they are just crowded more closely together towards the center in the bcd galaxies .",
    "the amount of star formation caused by pressurized triggering versus spontaneous instabilities is likely similar as well .",
    "so what causes the centralized star formation bursts that characterize bcds ?",
    "two possibilities explored in this paper include an inherent central mass density concentration @xcite or gravitational interactions with nearby objects , including gas infall / accretion @xcite .",
    "although gravitational interactions are often invoked to explain bursts of star formation in galaxies , previous studies have shown that not all the star formation activity in bcds can be explained by external gravitational triggers . a plot of current normalized star formation rate vs.  distance to the",
    "nearest projected ( catalogued ) galaxy shows no obvious correlation between presence / distance to companion and star formation activity for ims , bcds , or sms in a sample of 140 galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with other searches for bright companions @xcite , and with work done by @xcite .",
    "this does not rule out possible triggering by much fainter companions , though , and there is some evidence for an excess of small / faint companions to bcds @xcite , and there are several examples of bcds with nearby small galaxies or gas clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such faint companions are difficult to detect and may have been missed in earlier studies of bcds . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "dwarf galaxies are common so `` the most likely object to perturb any galaxy is a dwarf , '' but the effect of a small / faint companion on a nearby dwarf galaxy will be more dramatic than on a much larger system .",
    "they suggest that a possible mechanism for driving mass inflow in dwarfs would be perturbation by a small companion , resulting in angular momentum redistribution , and that such interactions could have happened long ago .",
    "once a low angular momentum system is created , it can continue to host episodic star formation for long time periods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is some evidence for central mass density concentration in bcds in both the neutral gas @xcite and in the optical underlying host galaxy @xcite .",
    "find that the 6 bcds in their sample have steep rotation curves relative to low surface brightness dwarfs ( lsbds ) with similar luminosities , with their mass distributions ( stars , gas , and dark matter ) more centrally concentrated , and that they are lower angular momentum systems than similar lsbds .",
    "they suggest that it is just such low angular momentum systems that are able to collapse into centrally concentrated objects with high central densities . for a solid body rotation curve ,",
    "the star formation threshold density is proportional to the slope of the rotation curve in a toomre disk instability analysis @xcite .",
    "hence , a steep rotation curve raises the critical threshold density for star formation .",
    "this delays the onset of star formation until the gas densities are quite high ; and once star formation does begin , the system is more susceptible to bursting behavior than a more diffuse ( higher angular momentum ) system .",
    "another possible cause for the star formation activity that characterizes bcds is the accretion / merger of a small gas cloud .",
    "such events have been invoked to explain mismatches between the optical and ( gas ) kinematic axes in galaxies , twists in the velocity field , extended / unusual gas morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , counter - rotation of the stellar and gas components , and the presence of stellar `` shell '' features in gas - poor systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "diagnosing the occurrence of a previous accretion / merger event in dirr galaxies , however , is complicated by their low gravitational potentials , large gas fractions , and slow rotation . with slower rotation and low gravitational potentials , their velocity fields",
    "are more easily disturbed by the energy injection from star formation regions , for example .",
    "as part of a project to determine what regulates star formation in small galaxies @xcite , we have obtained multiwavelength data ( @xmath7 and h@xmath8  images ) for 136 galaxies , with additional data ( e.g. @xmath9 , nuv , fuv ) for a subset .",
    "these data have recently been augmented by deep , high resolution interferometric atomic hydrogen spectral line ( ) observations of 40 of these galaxies as part of the little things ( lt ) project : local irregulars that trace luminosity extremes : the  nearby galaxy survey ( http://www.lowell.edu/users/dah/littlethings/ ) . as part of our investigation into star formation in dwarf galaxies , we are interested in looking at `` what goes wrong '' in bcds ",
    "why they have such strong central star formation occurring .",
    "vii zw 403  is one of a few bcd galaxies in our sample , and we use it here as a case study for actively star - forming dwarfs . because it is apparently relatively isolated , with no spiral density waves or shear , it is a good testbed for examining how star formation might be triggered in active dwarf galaxies .",
    "we present the results of an initial study here ; future papers associated with the lt project will present more in - depth analysis and modeling , particularly of the kinematics .",
    "although vii zw 403  has generally been assumed to be a member of the m81 group , @xcite state that vii zw 403 , with a distance of 4.4 mpc , is behind the m81 group and is being accelerated towards both it and the local group .",
    "they find that vii zw 403 is 1.14 mpc from m81 and that the m81 group has a zero - velocity radius of @xmath10 mpc . @xcite and @xcite determined a distance of 4.5 mpc using the tip of the red giant branch from color - magnitude diagrams based on _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) data .",
    "this places it on the far side of the m81 group .",
    "@xcite used the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) to search for nearby galaxies in the plane of the sky within 1 mpc and @xmath11 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the only object found ( an i m galaxy , kdg 073 ) had a projected distance of 900 kpc with a velocity difference of @xmath12 km s@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite classified vii zw 403  as an ie galaxy : one with irregular bright star formation regions near , but not at the center of , a low - surface brightness envelope .",
    "subsequent observations with hst confirmed the presence of a smooth elliptical distribution of old , metal - poor red giant stars with an exponential fall - off in surface density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the scale - length for this evolved population is about 1 kpc @xcite , which is normal for bcds @xcite .",
    "there are several bright regions with young blue stars loosely clustered nearby , and diffuse h@xmath8emission as well .",
    "fabry - perot h@xmath8  maps @xcite detected little rotation , finding only a chaotic velocity field and a velocity dispersion of approximately 30 km s@xmath2  in the diffuse emission , consistent with stellar winds .",
    "initial  inteferometric observations by @xcite revealed that although the  is centrally concentrated in general in the galaxy , there are two areas of higher flux density .",
    "the velocity dispersion map showed high values for the region separating the two peaks , and they interpret the high dispersion in the region between the peaks as due to a lack of flux .",
    "as most  observations of bcds show smoothly distributed gas with only one mostly centralized density peak , the presence of two peaks was intriguing , especially if truly separated by a region of lower density . to examine the gas morphology and kinematics in greater detail , and to search for possible companions and/or evidence of gravitational interactions",
    ", we subsequently obtained high spatial and velocity resolution  interferometric data of vii zw 403  to combine with multiwavelength optical , uv , and ir data .",
    "these data are presented below .",
    "we have collected images of vii zw 403 at a variety of wavelengths : h@xmath8 , _ galex _ fuv and nuv , ground - based @xmath0 , and _ spitzer _",
    "3.6 @xmath13 m .",
    "the images are shown in figure [ fig : combineimages ] and observations and data reduction are described below .",
    "we obtained @xmath7 and h@xmath8  images of vii zw 403 with the perkins 1.8 m telescope at lowell observatory .",
    "the @xmath7 images were obtained on photometric nights with a site 2048@xmath142048 ccd binned @xmath15 for a field of view of 10.4 .",
    "the @xmath16 and b - band images were obtained on ut 13 march 1999 and the @xmath17-band image on 10 april 1999 .",
    "the exposure times were @xmath18 s for @xmath16 , @xmath19 s for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 s for @xmath17 .",
    "the binned pixel scale was 0608 , and the seeing on individual and in the final averaged images was 21 in @xmath16 , 28 in @xmath20 , and 35 in @xmath17 .",
    "the data were reduced using common routines in image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) . using ccdproc , we subtracted the electronic pedestal ( sometimes referred to as the `` bias '' ) using the overscan strip , and flat - fielded the images using twilight sky flats .",
    "twilight flats were found , empirically , to work better than dome flats in removing large - scale structure in the ccd response .",
    "we used @xcite standard stars in 18 fields over the 3-night observing run in march 1999 to calibrate the @xmath22 photometry and in 13 fields over the 2-night observing run in april 1999 to calibrate the @xmath17-band photometry .",
    "the rms of the color terms were 0.015 mag for @xmath20 , 0.009 mag for @xmath16 , and 0.011 mag for @xmath17 .",
    "the rms of the zero point terms were 0.015 mag for @xmath20 , 0.088 mag for @xmath16 , and 0.002 mag for @xmath17 .",
    "the rms of the extinction coefficients were 0.045 mag for @xmath20 , 0.053 mag for @xmath16 , and 0.005 mag for @xmath17 .",
    "the images in each filter were averaged ( imcombine ) in such a way as to eliminate cosmic rays while still preserving the photometric integrity of the image .",
    "specifically , images were compared pixel by pixel for values that deviated from the average by more than 3 sigma , based on the ccd noise characteristics .",
    "deviant pixels were then eliminated from the average .    to prepare the images for surface photometry , we edited ( imedit ) foreground stars and background galaxies from the final @xmath7 images .",
    "the editing involved replacing a circular or rectangular area with an interpolation across the region based on the surroundings .",
    "the @xmath16-band image was done by hand , and then the cursor log file produced from that was used to remove objects from the other two filters . in that way",
    ", stars were removed in the same way for each filter .",
    "we then made a two - dimensional fit to the background ( imsurfit ) using the non - galaxy part of the image as seen in a deep display of the image .",
    "we subtracted ( imarith ) this sky image from the object image to produce a sky - subtracted final image for analysis .",
    "we obtained h@xmath8  images of vii zw 403 on 4 february 1995 using a ti @xmath23 ccd provided to lowell observatory by the national science foundation .",
    "we used the ohio state university fabry - perot as a simple 3:1 focal reducer since we were not interested in narrow - band spectral information and the h@xmath8  filter had a higher efficiency than the fabry - perot etalon .",
    "the h@xmath8  filter has a central wavelength of 6566   and a fwhm of 32  .",
    "the contribution from stellar continuum was determined using an off - band filter centered at 6440   with a fwhm of 95  .",
    "the h@xmath8  observations consisted of two 1300 s images , preceded and followed by a 600 s off - band observation . given the fwhm of the filters , this approximately matched the s / n of the on and off - band filters .",
    "the pixel scale was 049 , and the seeing on the individual and final image is 17 .",
    "the electronic pedestal ( `` bias '' ) was subtracted using the overscan strip , and the images were flat - fielded using dome flats .",
    "we shifted , scaled , and subtracted the off - band image from the h@xmath8image to remove the stellar continuum and leave only h@xmath8  nebular emission .",
    "we calibrated the h@xmath8  flux using observations of 5 spectrophotometric standard stars @xcite and observations of the ngc 2363 nebula @xcite taken over the course of the 6-night observing run .",
    "these two types of calibrations agreed with each other to within 4% .",
    "the h@xmath8  flux has been corrected for the shift of the bandpass with temperature .",
    "the central wavelength shifts blueward by 0.018 nm for each degree of temperature decrease from 20@xmath24 c , and so this needs to be considered in calibrating the flux through these narrow - band filters as it sometimes moves the object emission line off the peak of the transmission function .",
    "the h@xmath8  flux has also been corrected for contamination by the [ nii]@xmath256584 emission line in the bandpass ( a 1% correction ) .",
    "we obtained the @xmath26-band image of vii zw 403 with the perkins 1.8 m telescope at lowell observatory with the ohio state infrared imager - spectrograph ( osiris * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the photometric night of ut 2 june 1996 .",
    "the instrument consisted of four mosaiced detectors to create a total array of 256@xmath14256 pixels with a field of view of 6.4 .",
    "the telescope was nodded to place vii zw 403 first in one half of the array and then in the other half , so that sky could also be measured in the half without the galaxy .",
    "the galaxy was offset a few arcseconds between images in order to allow removal of hot pixels when the frames were averaged later .",
    "the image of vii zw 403 is a combination of 48 exposures of 26 s each .",
    "the pixel scale was 150 , and the seeing of the final image was 32 .",
    "the data were reduced in iraf .",
    "zero second bias frames were subtracted from all of the data , the image pixel values were corrected for non - linearity effects , and pixel to pixel sensitivity variations were removed using observations of a white screen in the dome .",
    "the non - linearity corrections were determined using a series of dome flats of increasing exposure time , to 29 seconds in steps of 1 second , sandwiched between darks .",
    "eight ukirt standard stars from the list compiled by s.  courteau ( 1996 , private communication ) were used to calibrate the photometry .",
    "each star was observed 4 times with the star placed in each quadrant in turn , and sky for a specific observation was taken from the observations with the star in the other quadrants .",
    "the rms of the zero point of the @xmath26-band calibration was 0.12 mag and of the extinction term was 0.08 mag .",
    "the california institute of technology ( cit ) photometric system is 8% bluer in @xmath27 and 4% bluer in @xmath28 compared to the ukirt system .",

    "our @xmath26-band image gives 13.71@xmath290.01 . in spite of the difference in calibration systems ( 2mass defines their own system ) , the magnitudes are the same within the uncertainties .",
    "we obtained near - uv ( nuv ) and far - uv ( fuv ) images of vii zw 403 from the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) archives .",
    "the images were part of the nearby galaxy survey .",
    "the fuv filter has a bandpass of 13501750  , an effective wavelength of 1516  , and a resolution of 40 .",
    "the fuv exposure time was 1617 s. the nuv filter has a bandpass of 17502800  , an effective wavelength of 2267  , and a resolution of 56 .",
    "the nuv integration time was 1479 s. the images were processed through the _ galex _ gr2/3 pipeline and were retrieved as final intensity maps with a 15 pixel scale .",
    "the _ galex _",
    "field of view is a circle with 12 diameter , and we extracted a portion around vii zw 403 .",
    "we subtracted ( imedit ) or masked foreground stars and background galaxies , and subtracted a low order two - dimensional fit to the background ( imsurfit ) .",
    "the decision of what objects did not belong to the galaxy and should be removed was based on morphology ( extended or stellar profiles ) , color , and similarity with other objects in the field well beyond the galaxy itself .      for completeness and to facilitate comparison ,",
    "we include the 3.6 @xmath13 m image taken of vii zw 403 with the infrared array camera ( irac * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( _ spitzer _ ) .",
    "the data were obtained from the _ spitzer _ archive and reduced with the basic calibrated data pipeline .",
    "the full treatment of the data is described by @xcite .",
    "21 cm spectral line observations of the galaxy were made using the b , c , and d configurations of the nrao .",
    "very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the b and d - configuration data were taken by deidre hunter ; the c configuration by trinh x.  thuan ( proposal code ah0453 ) , who kindly supplied us with these observations . the d configuration , with its short spacings , provides high sensitivity but a relatively low spatial resolution of @xmath30 1 .",
    "the c and b configurations , with longer baselines , provide higher resolution ( nominally 125 and 4 , respectively ) but lower surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "after editing and calibration ( discussed below ) , the three data sets were combined to produce images with both high sensitivity and high angular resolution .",
    "time on source for the c and d configuration observations was approximately 4 hours each ; for the b , approximately 9 hours .",
    "observations for all configurations were made using a correlator setting using 2if mode with hanning smoothing with a total bandwidth of 1.56 mhz .",
    "this results in 128 channels with a channel separation of 12.2 khz ( 2.6 km s@xmath2 ) . for spectral line data that are taken using on - line hanning smoothing ,",
    "the velocity resolution is equal to the channel separation , and so is also 2.6 km s@xmath2 .",
    "observational information is provided in table  [ tab : hiobs ] .",
    "the d configuration observations were set up to be consistent with the previously existing c configuration observations , so the two sets of observations could be combined after calibration for analysis .",
    "the central observing frequencies and velocities were the same , other than the usual changes in sky frequency due to the day , time , and location of the sources on the sky .",
    "however , the b configuration observations were taken during the beginning of the transition of the vla to the extended vla ( evla ) ; so doppler tracking while observing was not available .",
    "the observations were done at a fixed frequency which corresponded with the central velocity ( @xmath31 km s@xmath2 ) from the c and d observations to within 3 or 4 channels ( approximately 12 khz ) . before the b data were combined with the other two data sets ( see below ) , the aips task cvel was used to shift the spectra in the b data set to correct for the earth s rotation and motion .",
    "careful comparison of the resulting spectrum after applying cvel with those from the c and d data ensured that all three data sets were now consistent in frequency and velocity space .",
    "calibration of all three data sets was performed independently , using the standard routines in aips .",
    "for the d configuration data , the flux and bandpass calibrator was 1411 + 522 ( 3c 295 ; all sources are in j2000 ) and the phase calibrator was 1435 + 760 ( j2000 ) . the c configuration observations used 1044 + 809 for phase calibration and 1331 + 305 ( 3c 286 ) for the flux and bandpass calibration .",
    "the phase calibrator for the b configuration data was the same as for the d ( 1435 + 760 ) , and the flux and bandpass calibrator was 0137 + 331 ( 3c 48 ) .",
    "the data reduction process was complicated by the presence of both absorption and emission from the milky way as vii zw 403 s systemic velocity is @xmath32 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the single - dish spectrum ( figure  [ fig : tmspec ] ) from the greenbank 91 m telescope @xcite shows a broad absorption feature from @xmath33 to @xmath34 km s@xmath2 , with a strong emission feature from @xmath3530 to @xmath36 km s@xmath2 . that emission feature shows a dip due to a narrow absorption line at a velocity of about 0 km s@xmath2 .    to reduce the amount of data potentially contaminated by galactic  in the d configuration calibrator data , a pseudo - continuum `` channel 0 '' dataset",
    "was constructed by averaging together the inner 50% of the line data ( normally , the inner 75% is used ) .",
    "this probably did not remove all the emission from the milky way , but was the best compromise given the situation . because these were daytime observations , solar contamination was also present on the shortest baselines for the calibrators as well as for the source data .",
    "the affected short baselines for the calibrator data were not used during the calibration by the application of an appropriately chosen `` uvrange '' ( only baselines longer than 0.55 k@xmath37 were used ) .",
    "once a satisfactory calibration was achieved , it was applied to the source line data .",
    "the bandpass calibrator was only affected by milky way  in a few channels , and as those had nt stood out as unusual in the previous solutions , the bandpass calibration was done , again applying the uvrange limit ( 0.55 k@xmath25 ) for the solar contamination .",
    "the continuum emission was removed using uvlin , which does a linear fit to specified ( line - free ) channels and then subtracts the fitted baseline from the spectral line channels .",
    "the channels used for the fit were chosen to be free of both line emission and galactic contamination .",
    "for the c configuration observations , the continuum source 1331 + 305 ( j2000 ) was observed for use as a flux and bandpass calibrator ; the nearby continuum source 1044 + 809 ( j2000 ) was observed for phase calibration .",
    "there was little galactic or solar contamination present in these data .",
    "for the c data , calibration proceeded normally . during editing of the channel 0 source data ,",
    "amplitudes above 0.4 jy were clipped to remove anomalously high amplitude visibilities on the shortest baselines during the beginning of the observation run .",
    "the editing and calibration tables were copied over to the line data , and a dirty map of the source data was made to check for interference and look for line - free channels to use for continuum subtraction .",
    "continuum subtraction using the line and inteference - free channels thus identified was done in the _ u - v _ plane using the task uvlsf , which works similarly to uvlin .",
    "the b configuration observations used 1331 + 305 ( j2000 ) for flux and bandpass calibration , and 1435 + 760 ( j2000 ) for phase calibration .",
    "the data from four antennas were flagged as unusable during the data collection process due to evla testing ; four more antennas were not in use during the observations . during calibration ,",

    "all of these jumps occurred between scans near the end of the observing run . changing the reference antenna for",
    "the calibration did not change the number or magnitude of the problematic jumps . after further consideration and testing ,",
    "the galaxy source data from the scans that were in between the calibrator scans with phase jumps larger than 40 degrees were removed by flagging .",
    "careful examination of the resulting images revealed no artifacts that would indicate phase errors with the data , such as asymmetric stripes , rings , or other odd - looking features .",

    "there was no apparent contamination from milky way emission visible in the b configuration data .",

    "their c spectrum resembles our d spectrum without the milky way emission ; indeed their total integrated flux from the c configuration data is 11.0 jy km s@xmath2 , which is close to our 11.5 jy km s@xmath2value .",

    "the similarity between the @xmath16 and the 3.6 @xmath13 m profiles implies that the star formation as a function of radius integrated over a 1-gyr time scale is the same as that integrated over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "the steeper nuv profile suggests that star formation over the last 200 myrs has been concentrated to the center of the galaxy .",
    "surface brightness profiles of bcds are generally found to contain multiple components with the outer component representing the galaxy underlying the intense current star formation @xcite .",
    "the central portions of these galaxies , on the other hand , are dominated by the current star formation , and the profiles are often steeper or more complex there .",

    "we can only trace @xmath75 to 1.1 kpc , but it is approximately constant over this radial range .",
    "@xmath76 also is roughly constant throughout the optical galaxy to @xmath64 .",
    "this trend in the colors is due to the fact that star formation is concentrated to the center of the galaxy .",
    "stellar populations becoming redder as one goes outwards from the center is seen in many bcds @xcite .    we have modeled the uv and optical colors of viizw403 s annular surface photometry using population synthesis fitting .",

    "h@xmath8 traces star formation over the past 10 myr , and figure [ fig : combineimages ] shows that most of the current star formation in vii zw 403 is found in one large complex located 6  east and 2  north of the center of the galaxy , only 130 pc from the nominal center determined from the outer @xmath16-band isophote .",
    "this type of central concentration of star formation is often seen in blue compact dwarfs , and is probably responsible for vii zw 403 s classification as a bcd .",
    "we show the azimuthally - averaged h@xmath8  surface brightness in figure [ fig : sb ] .",
    "although the current star formation in vii zw 403 is contained in a giant  complex at the galaxy center ( the h@xmath8 emission seen in figure [ fig : combineimages ] ) , because the  complex is large , h@xmath8  emission appears in elliptical annuli out to a radius of 1.3 kpc .",
    "the h@xmath8  surface brightness drops off faster than the starlight in the @xmath16-band and 3.6 @xmath13 m image , dropping only a little faster beyond 0.75 kpc and ending at 1.3 kpc .",
    "the fuv and nuv passbands measure the light directly from stars and are dominated by young massive stars formed over the past 200 myr .",

    "the star formation rate derived from h@xmath8  is similar to that derived from the uv .",
    "vii zw 403 has a star formation rate per unit area that is normal , but towards the high end of the range , for irregular galaxies @xcite , as shown in figure [ fig : sfrd ] .",
    "again , this is consistent with the galaxy s classification as a bcd .",
    "however , modeling of the color - magnitude diagram of the stellar population by @xcite suggests that the star formation rate was much higher about 600800 myr ago than it is today , by as much as a factor of 30 .",
    "the @xmath16 and 3.6 @xmath13m - band radial profiles in figure  [ fig : sb ] are smooth exponential disks with about the same slope in the central part of the galaxy , but the h@xmath8  and nuv are peaked in the center and fall faster than @xmath16 or 3.6 @xmath13 m .",
    "this indicates a change in the primary site of star formation about 200 myr ago , the timescale the nuv is sensitive to .",
    "this is a relatively short dynamical time ( @xmath80 two galactic rotations ; see ",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] ) for this slowly rotating galaxy .",
    "we can not determine the cause of this shift in star formation location , but it is unlikely to have been caused by a collision or accretion event .",
    "the timescale is short enough that we should still see either two galactic nuclei or tidal debris , which we do nt .",
    "a central collapse to a bar could explain it , but we see no hint of a bar in the @xmath16 , @xmath26 , or 3.6 @xmath13 m images .    at its current rate of consumption ,",
    "the galaxy can turn gas into stars for another 5 gyr if all of the gas associated with the galaxy can be used .",
    "the timescale to run out of gas becomes 10 gyr if recycling of gas from dying stars is also considered @xcite .",
    "these timescales to exhaust the gas are somewhat short for irregular galaxies @xcite , but nevertheless , the galaxy is in no danger of running out of the fuel for star formation any time soon .",
    "as  is the raw material from which molecular clouds , and then stars , form , the  properties of a galaxy are fundamental to understanding its past , current , and future star formation .",
    "the total  mass from the integrated d configuration data is @xmath81 @xmath82 , which is below the median of @xmath83 for the large sample of star - forming galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "this value for the hydrogen mass includes only the emission we believe is associated with vii zw 403itself .",
    "this does not include the secondary emission peak seen in the spectrum around @xmath42 km s@xmath2  that we believe is due to galactic contamination ( see   [ sec : calibration ] ) .",
    "the @xmath84 is 0.91 .",
    "this is within the range ( 0.22.0 ) of the sample of 11 bcds from @xcite , but is on the high end of the distribution for the 24 bcds ( @xmath85 to @xmath86 ) , and below the median for ims ( @xmath87 ) shown in figure 4 of @xcite . for comparison with the sample in @xcite ,",
    "we follow their method to `` correct '' the global luminosity by removing the effect from the starburst so that it is more representative of the bulk of the stars in the galaxy .",
    "this increases the @xmath84 ratio to 1.82 , which is higher than the @xcite median of 1.3 .",
    "although the  mass for vii zw 403  is relatively low on an absolute scale , its relatively high @xmath84 ( even `` uncorrected '' for the starburst ) could indicate that it is either a somewhat gas - rich bcd or is currently `` luminosity - poor '' as it is presumably post - starburst : it should have been brighter during the burst of 600800 myr ago detected by @xcite .",
    "the azimuthally averaged surface density profiles of the  gas for vii zw 403  using the center , position angle , and inclination from both the optical and  data are shown in figure  [ fig : surdens ] .",
    "the profiles were calculated by integrating the  from the c@xmath47d@xmath48  map ( beam size @xmath88 ) using 30  rings with ( 1 ) a center position of @xmath89 , 7916  103 ( b1950.0 ) , a position angle of @xmath58 , and an inclination of 66  taken from the @xmath16-band photometry (   [ sec : optical ] ) ; and ( 2 ) a center position of @xmath90 @xmath91 , 79  16  @xmath92(b1950.0 ) , a position angle of @xmath93 , and an inclination of 77  taken from the ne half of the  rotation curve analysis (  [ sec : kinematics ] ) .",

    "the values for vii zw 403  are 1.4 and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "we can see from the figure that the  surface density for vii zw 403  derived using the  parameters falls off smoothly and slightly more steeply in the central regions than those for the ims ; more so when using the optical parameters . in comparison to the bcd and dirr  surface density profiles presented in @xcite ,",
    "the shape of vii zw 403 s profile is similar to those of the bcds , and somewhat steeper than those for the dirrs .",
    "the central surface densities from both the optical and parameters for vii zw 403  are seen to be low compared to the bcds in the sample ; when using the  parameters , the central surface density is like that of the dirrs .",

    "this figure shows that there is a large , low - level irregular skirt of  gas that extends beyond the optical emission , especially toward the south .",

    "one can see here that there is ordered rotation , with the ne portion of the galaxy approaching and the sw half of the galaxy receding . however , it is also immediately apparent that the velocity field is complex .",
    "first , there is a curve in the isovelocity contours so that the ne and sw portions of the galaxy have distinctly different kinematic axes .",
    "the kinematic axis of the ne half of the galaxy is aligned roughly at an angle of + 45 .",
    "the sw part of the galaxy , on the other hand , appears to have a line of nodes at about + 25 , which is aligned more closely with the optical galaxy s major axis at @xmath58 .",
    "second , there are places where the velocity field is not well behaved .",
    "in particular on the east side of the galaxy the isovelocity contours curve back upward in a complex manner , and in the south there are `` islands '' of different velocities .    as strange as this velocity field appears ,",
    "there are other dwarf galaxies with curves in the position angles of their isovelocity contours similar to what we see in vii zw 403 .",
    "a review of the literature revealed ten other bcds with this type of feature ( eso338-ig04 : @xcite ; haro 2 : @xcite ; haro 33 , mrk 51 : @xcite ; ngc 1569 : @xcite ; ngc 3738 : @xcite ; ngc 1705 : @xcite ; ugc 4483 , um462 : @xcite ; um323 : @xcite ) , and there are undoubtedly others .",

    "we also found a comparable number of i m galaxies with this sort of feature ( ddo 22 , ddo 68 : @xcite ; ddo 69 : @xcite ; ddo 165 , ddo 187 , ugc 3698 : @xcite ; ddo 210 : @xcite ; ddo 216 : @xcite ; eso 245-g005 : @xcite ; ngc 2366 : @xcite ; ngc 4163 : @xcite ) .",
    "since some of the i m galaxies have no current star formation activity or very little , we can not associate this velocity field feature with the starburst that makes vii zw 403 special .",

    "we tried fitting the whole field and just one side at a time while varying initial parameters . for the final rotation curve(s )",
    "we used a position angle of 40 , an inclination of 66 , and a rotational velocity of 13 km s@xmath2  for the initial guesses . from this we determined the center ( 11@xmath55 24@xmath56 351@xmath57 , 79  16  18@xmath2927 , b1950.0 ) and systemic velocity ( @xmath103 km s@xmath2 )",
    "the experiments with varying initial guesses suggested that the uncertainties given above are reasonable .",
    "a fit with the center fixed and a solid body function yielded the same systemic velocity .",
    "we then fixed the center position and central velocity and fit the field in concentric rings that were 15  in width and stepped every 15 .",
    "the innermost circle did not yield a solution and that point is omitted . for the sw or receding half of the galaxy , we adopted the center position and systemic velocity determined from the ne half and again fit in concentric rings .",

    "the kinematic axis in each ring is traced as the black line on figure [ fig : velfield ] .",

    "the inclination , on the other hand , is quite variable although over much of each half of the field it changes systematically .",
    "generally the inclinations are all higher than we expect based on the optical major - to - minor axis ratio .",
    "the maximum rotation speed is about 15 km s@xmath2on the ne side and a few km s@xmath2  lower on the sw side .    with a maximum rotation velocity of only @xmath3015 km s@xmath2  ( @xmath30 16 km s@xmath2when corrected for an inclination @xmath104 ) and an average dispersion velocity in the c@xmath47d@xmath48  map of 8.5 km s@xmath2(figure  [ fig : veldisp ] ;  [ sec : disp ] )",
    ", the galaxy has a significant amount of pressure support from the random motions in the gas .",
    "this means that simply using the rotation velocity will result in an underestimate of the dynamical mass .",
    "we have corrected for this by adding in the pressure support ; this is called the asymmetric drift correction .",
    "to calculate this , we used the procedure described in @xcite and we follow their discussion here . to make this applicable to a gas disk rather than a collisionless stellar system for which the rotational velocities are much larger than the random motions",

    "we further assume that neither the velocity dispersions nor the scale height vary significantly across the disk ( i.e.  with radius @xmath111 ) , so their derivatives are zero , leaving us with @xmath112 .",

    "the profile was fairly well fit with @xmath116 @xmath82  pc@xmath54 , @xmath117 ( 0.55 kpc ) , and @xmath118 ( 1.26 kpc ) .",

    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : rot ] ( open circles ) , along with the uncorrected rotation curves ( solid circles ) . applying the correction increases the maximum velocities to 20 km s@xmath2  for the ne half and 22 km s@xmath2  for the sw half .",
    "the corrected rotation curve is essentially that of a solid body on both sides of the galaxy .",
    "the necessity of correcting the rotation to include pressure support is apparent when we calculate a dynamical mass for vii zw 403 . using the highest rotational velocity from the uncorrected rotation curves and @xmath120 we get an estimated dynamical mass of @xmath121 @xmath82 .",
    "this is an @xmath122 of 0.66 , which is higher than the ranges for bcds found by others @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes worse when the total luminous mass ( @xmath123 ) is considered .",
    "the gas mass is found by multiplying the  mass by a factor of 1.34 to correct for he .",
    "no correction is made for molecular gas ; no good estimates exist as co detections in bcds have been few , and those primarily in bcds with elliptical inner isophotes @xcite , or in metal - rich dirrs : @xcite report from a literature sample that there are no known detections of co in galaxies with @xmath124 .",
    "vii zw 403  has irregular inner isophotes and @xmath125 @xcite , so is unlikely to have detectable co.    to find the mass in stars , we can estimate a lower limit by using a stellar @xmath126 ratio from @xcite that is a function of @xmath73 color : @xmath127 this is appropriate for a @xcite stellar initial mass function and metallicity @xmath128 and is derived using the @xcite stellar population models .",
    "this results in a stellar mass of approximately @xmath129 @xmath82 , or a stellar mass - to - light ratio of 0.89 .",
    "however , this does not take the starburst into account .",
    "assuming that the sfr was 30 times higher for 200 myr @xcite during the past 13 gyr , we then add that to the constant sfr model ( 0.013 @xmath82  yr@xmath2 ) and obtain an upper estimate of @xmath130 @xmath82  ( stellar @xmath131 = 1.6 ) . with this range ,",

    "even the lower of these is greater than the highest dynamical mass estimated from the uncorrected rotation curve by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "however , when we use the corrected rotation curves to calculate a dynamical mass , we get @xmath134 @xmath82 , which is 1.5 times larger than even the higher estimate of the luminous mass .",

    "contours from the b@xmath47c@xmath47d@xmath48  data showing the velocity dispersions across the galaxy overlaid on the  flux map are shown in figure [ fig : veldisp ] .",
    "in general , the higher dispersion areas ( @xmath135 km s@xmath2 ) correspond to the area where most of the h@xmath8  flux originates , as shown in figure [ fig : bcd1m2onha ] . there is nothing notable in either the @xmath16 or h@xmath8  images in the unresolved region of highest dispersion ( located just ne of the large  clump ) , but it is adjacent to an unresolved x - ray source @xcite , as discussed below .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : bcd0m0onha ] , the highest column density region roughly corresponds to the region of strongest h@xmath8emission .",

    ", they were unable to verify that the continuum emission is mainly thermal in nature ( and thus directly due to to the  region ) , but it does seem likely .",
    "@xcite presented _ chandra _ x - ray observations of several dwarf starburst galaxies , including vii zw 403 .",
    "their data show no diffuse x - ray emission associated with vii zw 403 .",
    "they found that the diffuse x - ray emission they detected in the other galaxies in their sample was probably associated with the development of galactic winds from coronal gas heated by star formation .",
    "they suggest that the lack of detected diffuse x - ray emission for vii zw 403  ( they give an upper limit of @xmath136 erg s@xmath2 ) could be due to several possible factors , including low metallicity or smaller volume .",
    "the expanding h@xmath8  shells in the two galaxies with no detected diffuse x - ray emission ( vii zw 403  and i zw 18 ) are 10 - 17 myr older than those in the galaxies for which they do detect diffuse emission . perhaps a coronal wind never developed , or perhaps it has already had time to cool .",
    "@xcite did detect one unresolved x - ray source whose power - law spectral index is consistent with that of an x - ray binary , but did not detect the filaments or lobes seen by @xcite from rosat data .",
    "similar x - ray sources in the @xcite sample of 8 starbursting galaxies are located near `` bright  regions , rims of superbubbles or young stellar clusters . ''",
    "the location of the unresolved x - ray source relative to the h@xmath8  emission can be seen in figure  [ fig : bcd0m0onha ] .",
    "the x - ray source is located near , but not coincident with , an h@xmath8  knot . as seen in figures  [ fig : bcd1m2onha ] and [ fig : bcd0m0onha ] , the x - ray source is also on the north edge of the high dispersion knot , and is located in / on the northeast side of the depression / cavity in the , in a smaller region of even lower density .",
    "recall that the broadband surface photometry ( figure  [ fig : sb ] ) was consistent with constant star formation in the outer regions over the past 1020 gyr , with more recent star formation ( past 200 myr ) in the central regions .",
    "if the x - ray source is , indeed , an x - ray binary , then perhaps we are seeing an evolved stellar system located near a region of recent star formation , and also near a region of disturbed neutral gas .",
    "the logical explanation is that a star formation episode and/or resulting supernova has injected energy into the , increasing the dispersion ; and depleting or perhaps clearing out some of the neutral gas .    to test this",
    ", we examined the kinematics of the gas in the b@xmath47c@xmath47d@xmath49  cube in a small region around the x - ray source . to enhance the signal - to - noise in the spectra , we `` collapsed '' a six - pixel square region centered on the x - ray source to a single pixel , and then examined the resulting spectrum .",
    "there was a fairly clear double - peak visible , so we fit a pair of gaussians to them ( using xgaus in aips ) .",
    "the two peaks are separated by 13.5 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with expansion ( or contraction ) of @xmath137 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the apparent radius of the depression around the x - ray source in the b@xmath47c@xmath47d@xmath49data is @xmath138 pc , which is roughly the same size as the beam .",
    "this means that the region may not be resolved , so this size is an upper limit .",
    "if we assume a constant expansion of 7 km s@xmath2 , we get approximately 15 myr to clear out a depression of that size .",
    "we then tried to estimate the amount of energy required to form such a depression using the method in @xcite .",
    "here we assume a spherically symmetric expansion .",
    "if the expansion has already blown out of the disk , this may not be the case ( and would increase the estimated age of the feature ; see below ) . for a velocity of 7 km s@xmath2  and a radius of 105 pc , we find the total energy required to be @xmath139 ergs . to get an estimate for the density ,",
    "@xmath140 , we assumed a pre - existing column density of @xmath141 cm@xmath54  based on the average density in the region around the small depression , and a scale height for the galaxy of 200 pc .",
    "the scale height was taken to be approximately equal to the radius of the larger  depression / cavity ( see below ) .",
    "this gives us @xmath142 @xmath143 , and a resulting total energy of @xmath144 ergs .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath145 ergs from a typical type ii supernova , so it is feasible in this sense .",
    "we then attempted to apply the models of @xcite for the formation of supershells from stellar winds and supernovae to estimate the number of stars with masses greater than 7@xmath82  required to produce a hole of a given size .",
    "the resulting number was approximately 200 , of which about 50 should be o stars .",
    "however , the resulting timescale for shell formation calculated from the models was short , only 2 myr . in this short time , the expansion due to the star formation is still primarily from stellar winds ; and it is unlikely that any stars would yet have exploded as supernovae , and we should be able to see an ob association of this size  which we do nt .",
    "so about all we can conclude is that the x - ray source appears to be coincident with an expanding depression in the ; and adjacent to a region of disturbed gas to the south .",
    "we also examined the kinematics of the gas around the edges of the larger depression / cavity in the .",
    "however , no expansion was detected .",
    "if we now use the average velocity dispersion in the gas ( 9 km s@xmath2 ) as an upper limit to any expansion , with a radius of 205 pc we obtain a lower limit of 22 myr for a hole this size to form . because we do nt detect expansion , the hole could be stalled because it has broken out and is freely expanding perpendicular to the disk , and so could be older than that .",
    "we used the same methods to estimate the required energy and number of stars required to form such a depression as for the area around the x - ray source .",
    "this time , we used a column density of @xmath146 cm@xmath54  based on the existing gas density around the cavity ; giving us an @xmath140 of 1.6 @xmath143 .",
    "the required energy is then @xmath147 ergs ( equivalent to approximately 30 sne ) .",
    "however , from the @xcite equations , the estimated number of stars needed to create such a large depression via winds ( and possibly supernovae , but see the timescale discussion , below ) with masses greater than 7@xmath82  is then 2800 , which is extremely high .",
    "if there were a young cluster that large , it would be easily visible .",
    "this suggests an older age for the formation of the large  cavity ; or perhaps the gas was slowly depleted / blown - out over long time - scales by a series of star - forming events rather than by one large cluster .",
    "a more serious problem with applying the @xcite model is that doing so results in a calculated timescale of only 3 myr ; which is not only short in stellar evolution terms , but also inconsistent with the lower limit of 22 myr we calculated , above .",
    "a similar disconnect was found by @xcite for formation of the large  regions in vii zw 403 .",
    "they used the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) to produce color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of several of the bright  regions in vii zw 403 .",
    "the brightest region ( visible as the darkest region of the grayscale in figure  [ fig : bcd0m0onha ] and marked in figure  [ fig : bcd-1m0onhst ] ) was consistent with an ob association containing approximately 25 bright blue ( o type ) stars ; the age of the cluster based on the cmd was 45 myr . from their ground - based long - slit emission line spectra of the  regions , they were able to detect expanding h@xmath8  shells ; including a partial shell around the brightest  region with a diameter of 79 pc and an expansion velocity of @xmath148 km s@xmath2 .",
    "they then attempted to use the @xcite models as we did , but they also found a timescale that was too short : @xmath30 1 myr , which did not match the 45 myr age estimate from the cmd .",
    "they concluded that perhaps this indicated that the starburst that formed the association was not instantaneous @xcite .",
    "@xcite also produced cmds of some of the central areas of vii zw 403 .",
    "the location of their `` center '' and `` north '' fields are marked in figure  [ fig : bcd-1m0onhst ] , which shows the hst image with contours from the b@xmath47c@xmath47d@xmath51  integrated flux map .",
    "neither field corresponds exactly with the  cavity / depression , but the `` north '' field is located on the east side of it , and just south of the x - ray source .",
    "the cmd for the `` north '' field is less rich in massive stars than the one for the `` center , '' which revealed approximately 20 red supergiants ( @xmath149 myr ) and some blue supergiants ( @xmath150 myr ) , but both regions contain a mixed - age population of stars with ages of 5 and 10 myr . in general , @xcite find a relatively smooth elliptical distribution of the evolved stars with a stellar surface density that falls off exponentially .",
    "the younger , bluer massive stars tend to exhibit clustering into associations and groups , and are primarily located in the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "the youngest are associated with the bright  regions , which we find are co - located with  peaks ( figure  [ fig : bcd-1m0onha ] ) .",
    "they posit star formation 12 gyr ago followed by a strong starburst episode 600800 myr ago , with less vigorous star - formation since then .",
    "interestingly , the kinematic center of vii zw 403  as identified by the rotation curve analysis lies close to the center of the large  cavity .",
    "if the cavity is the result of star - formation , this would be consistent with centrally - concentrated star - formation activity in the past .",
    "there is evidence that stellar feedback from star formation events can and does create sometimes large ( @xmath80 1 kpc )  holes and shells , as found by @xcite in ic 2574 .",
    "another possibility for forming the hole is consumption of the gas by star formation .",
    "the timescale to consume the gas that filled the hole at the current star formation rate , given our estimate of the pre - existing level of the gas in that region , is of order 700 myr .",
    "this is relatively short if star formation has been on - going in this region for that extended period of time .",
    "alternatively , the original gas in this region could have been consumed quite quickly by the starburst that took place 600800 myr ago @xcite , but we then require that the hole not be replenished very rapidly , which seems unreasonable given that the hole should have filled in long ago just from the dispersion in the gas .",
    "one possible explanation for the enhanced star formation episode that characterizes bcds is proposed by @xcite , who suggest that it is a natural consequence of the central mass density concentration found in bcds . in an optical study of a sample of 18 bcds and 11 dirrs",
    ", they find that when the luminosity contribution from the starburst is ignored ( by fitting the underlying host galaxy s surface brightness profile as determined from an exponential fit to only the outer portions ) , the underlying hosts of bcds have shorter scale lengths and higher central surface brightnesses than dirrs with similar absolute magnitudes .",
    "they cite the shorter scale lengths as evidence of stellar compactness : that bcds are low - surface brightness galaxies with the highest central stellar mass concentrations in the dwarf spectrum .",
    "there is some evidence that this may be the case for the  gas in bcds as well : @xcite plotted  surface density profiles for a sample of bcds and dirrs , and found that the gas in bcds is more centrally concentrated than in similar dirrs .",
    "it is commonly thought that the gas surface density must exceed a critical threshold in order to support a starburst @xcite ; @xcite also suggest that the high central mass density concentration allows these galaxies to retain their gas , allowing episodic bursts , and calculations by @xcite indicate that mass loss should be minimal for galaxies with gas masses greater than @xmath151 @xmath82 .",
    "a follow - up study of the  in a sample of bcds by @xcite found that the @xmath152 for these galaxies is about twice as high as that for low surface brightness dwarfs when only the luminosity of the underlying low - surface brightness component of the bcd is taken into account .",
    "this provides a significant gas reservoir to support the starburst episodes , and could enhance the ability of the galaxy to retain gas during / after a burst . additionally ,",
    "if the gas remains concentrated even after a burst , then the timescale between bursts could be short .",
    "this would make it difficult to find a bcd in the `` off '' state .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct then we would expect vii zw 403  to exhibit signs of central compactness , both optically and in the .",
    "we find that compared to the sample in @xcite , vii zw 403  has a slightly lower @xmath67 at a given m@xmath153 than their sample of bcds , although slightly higher than for their lsbds . as mentioned in  [ sec : optical ] , vii zw 403 s scale length ( relative to its @xmath71 ) lies at the peak of the distribution of the sample of dims and bcds plotted in @xcite .",
    "compared to the @xcite sample , however , it is large not only for their sample of bcds , but also compared to their lsbd sample .",
    "so the underlying stellar component does not appear to be greatly centrally concentrated .",
    "however , there are some indications for central concentration in the  on larger scales ( i.e.  at a linear resolution similar to that for which structure is seen in the  in dirrs ; see figure  [ fig : cd1m0onv ] ) .",
    "however , since the vigorous star formation episodes that characterize bcds are relatively short - lived compared to the age of the host galaxy , perhaps these systems do nt start out with a high central mass concentration .",
    "finds that bcds are low angular momentum systems , and suggests that they have collapsed to more centrally concentrated systems with steeper rotation curves .",
    "this affects the critical threshold density for star formation , and makes bcds more susceptible to star bursts than higher angular momentum systems .",
    "this `` collapse '' requires a redistribution of mass in the galaxy .",
    "one proposed mechanism for mass redistribution and angular momentum transfer in low mass bcds ( without nearby companions ) is a barlike torque arising from the irregular symmetry and irregular mass distribution in these small systems , or from an elongated dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "such mass flow should show up in the rotation pattern of the gas disk as a central twisting of the isovelocity contours .",
    "vii zw 403  has a change of 1520  between the ne and sw parts of the galaxy , so we ca nt rule out the possibility of some kind of mass flow in the gas disk .    another possible mechanism for flattening the gravitational potential and expansion of the stellar component",
    "is suggested by @xcite , who propose that the heating of the ism by the energy from the starburst could be the mechanism for mass and angular momentum redistribution . although vii zw 403 s scale length is not particularly short , which could indicate that it has undergone some expansion , the lack of diffuse x - ray as well as the lack of extensive large - scale structure in the  ( the  depression discussed above occupies only a small , central part of the galaxy ) would seem to indicate that not much energy has been injected into the galaxy as a whole by star formation .",
    "it seems unlikely , then , that enough energy would have been produced to initiate any significant redistribution of the mass in the galaxy , especially the stellar component . in conclusion , it is nt clear that this theory of large - scale mass re - arrangement can explain what we see in vii zw 403 .",
    "interactions , either with other galaxies or with small gas companions , have also been proposed as the triggering mechanism for the starbursts that occur in bcds ( see @xcite for an overview of the literature ) , yet surveys to detect nearby possible perturbers around bcds have had mixed results ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , vii zw 403  would seem to be in the set of galaxies that havent been tidally triggered , as we have found no nearby  clouds or companion galaxies .",
    "however , if it had accreted a small perturber in the distant past , this might be difficult to detect .",
    "there is observational evidence that some dwarf systems have undergone accretion or merger events in the past .",
    "a nearby example is thought to be ic 10 , which @xcite argue still has primordial gas settling into the galaxy via accretion . classic signatures of accretion include the appearance of two distinctly different kinematic components , visible in the  or stellar velocity fields .",
    "although the gas isovelocity contours for vii zw 403 are somewhat perturbed , this is nt unusual for bcds (  [ sec : kinematics ] ) , and there do nt appear to be two completely separate components despite the change in position angle of the  kinematic axis .",
    "another accretion signature is a misalignment between the optical and  axes .",
    "@xcite plotted the difference between optical and  kinematic axes for 47 i m and sm galaxies taken from @xcite and found that about half had offsets less than 10 , with the maximum being 40 . for vii",
    "zw 403 , the optical axis is at @xmath58 . in the ne half of the galaxy ,",
    "the  kinematical axis is at + 45  to + 50 , and is around + 20  to + 30  in the sw part , so there is a somewhat significant misalignment between the gas and optical components of between 30  and 60 .    for further comparison , we look to the gas - rich i m galaxy ddo 26 , for which @xcite conclude that the most likely explanation for the lack of relaxation they detect in its gas kinematics is the on - going merger of two small gas - rich objects .",
    "they find an optical/  axis misalignment of 60 , along with a change in the  position angle with radius .",
    "they also find that the velocity field of ddo 26 is fairly regular in the inner regions and becomes less so in the outer disk .",
    "these are features that are similar to but more extreme than those we see in vii zw 403 .",
    "differences include the presence of a faint  arm in ddo 26 and the detection of two separate peaks in the  intensity which were both fairly broad ( @xmath154 km s@xmath2 ) in velocity . additionally , ddo 26 is currently quiescent , with a sfr of 0.0004 @xmath82yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath54 compared to vii zw 403 s rate of 0.02 @xmath82  yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath54 .",
    "so from these comparisons , it seems possible that vii zw 403underwent an accretion or merger event in the past .",
    "another possibility to explain the skew in the  kinematic axis is that expansion of the  regions has caused a subsequent expansion in the surrounding , lifting it out of the plane of the galaxy . if the near side of the galaxy is to the west ( right ) , and we envision the expanding  as distributed in a torus aligned with the plane of the galaxy , then gas to the left of the kinematic center would be blue - shifted relative to the bulk of the galaxy .",
    "likewise , the gas to the right of center would be somewhat behind the bulk of the galaxy and red - shifted .",
    "the expanding gas would then skew the observed velocity field in the sense that we see : the isovelocity contours in the north part will be skewed to the left , and those in the south skewed to the right .",
    "if the expansion is on the order of the 7 km s@xmath2  we measured for the lowest density region around the x - ray source , or the 9 km s@xmath2  limit set by the average dispersion , then in this slowly rotating galaxy , the expected skew would be large , which is what we see . in this case",
    ", the hole in the  would be due to a combination of consumption and slow blow - out .",
    "we have used multi - wavelength data to examine the relation between the stars and gas in vii zw 403  in an effort to understand the origin of the starbursting activity that characterizes bcd galaxies . as for many bcds ,",
    "in the optical @xmath16-band we find a mostly symmetrical , elliptical distribution of stars ; this is overlaid with a color gradient that is bluer in the central regions and redder in the outer .",
    "this indicates that the central regions have undergone star formation in the past 200 myr , whereas the outer region colors indicate constant star formation over the past 1020 gyr .",
    "the galaxy also has a few large  regions concentrated toward the center of the galaxy ( within the inner 1.3 kpc ) where star formation has occurred in the past 10 myr .",
    "most of the activity is in a large complex just south of the central part of the galaxy .",
    "overall , the sfr for vii zw 403  is at the high end of the normal range for dirrs , which is , again , typical for bcds .",
    "however , the galaxy can continue to form stars at this rate for at least 5 gyr more ; 10 gyr if we include gas recycling @xcite .    our new vla data in combination with earlier data resulted in a lower total  flux detection than single - dish estimates ;",
    "we believe this is due to inclusion of milky way emission in the single - dish spectra and in the low - resolution vla observations . we have attempted to remove this galactic contamination from our low - resolution ( d configuration ) data for our analysis here .",
    "our total  mass estimate then is @xmath155 @xmath82 , which is lower than the median for the salzer bcd sample @xcite , but within the normal range of values .",
    "however , the m@xmath156/l@xmath153  indicates that vii zw 403  is somewhat gas - rich for a bcd of similar luminosity .",
    "conversely , it may be `` luminosity - poor '' relative to other similarly - sized bcds : earlier work by @xcite concluded that the sfr for vii zw 403  was up to 30 times greater 600800 myr ago .",
    "perhaps we are seeing it post - burst .",
    "the idea that vii zw 403  is presently past the peak of a starburst event could also explain the non - detection of diffuse x - ray emission by @xcite , indicating a lack of coronal wind or that it has had time to cool .    the  velocity field ,",
    "although complex with a change in position angle of the kinematic axis between the ne and sw components of about 1520 , is not that unusual for a bcd .",
    "we see no other strong indications of a large - scale gravitational interaction in the velocity field , such as tidal tails or strewn - about .",
    "the skew in the velocity field can , however , be explained if the  in the galaxy is undergoing a general symmetric expansion away from the plane on both sides surrounding the star - forming region as a result of pressure from the h@xmath8  region .",
    "the rotation curve is essentially solid - body for both halves of the galaxy , and with correction for asymmetric drift , produces a dynamical mass estimate that is similar to those of other bcds @xcite .",
    "if the galaxy is post - starburst , then one might expect to see some effect in the interstellar medium from the energy injected by stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "additionally , star formation should use up some of the neutral gas in the galaxy . in accordance with this , although the  is more centrally concentrated in vii zw 403  than in dirrs , the central  surface density is lower than is typical for the bcds in the @xcite sample , and the  is more extended  out to 4.3 r@xmath157 ( 2.3 r@xmath158 ) . at large scales ( 650 pc ) , the  distribution appears relatively smooth as for most bcds .",
    "this is in contrast to dirr galaxies , which at the same scale often show structure in the gas component in the form of holes , shells , and ridges .",
    "for vii zw 403however , we begin to see some structure in the  distribution only at small ( 200 pc ) scales .",
    "there is clearly a connection between recent star formation and the distribution and kinematics in the galaxy .",
    "the youngest stars ( 45 myr old ) are located near  regions and local peaks in the , with the regions of highest  column density corresponding to the regions of strongest h@xmath8  flux ( as seen in other bcds ) .",
    "our  maps also show that the regions of higher dispersion are located near , although not completely coincident with , with h@xmath8regions ; perhaps in response to the energy injected by the star formation activity .",
    "interestingly , the region of highest dispersion in our map is directly adjacent to the unresolved x - ray source detected by @xcite that could be an x - ray binary .",
    "the source is located near an  region , and is in a small lower - density region at the edge of a larger depression or cavity in the .",
    "the center of the large cavity is coincident with the kinematic center of the  velocity field .",
    "we attempted to investigate whether the small low - density region could be the result of star formation / sne blowing a hole in the gas .",
    "although both the amount of energy required and the number of massive stars needed were reasonable , the timescale from the shell formation model was too short for many sne to have already occurred .",
    "we performed the same analysis for the ( stalled ) large cavity in the , but found that in addition to requiring the presence of a large star cluster ( not seen ) , the timescale from the model was again too short .",
    "similar timescale discrepancies were found by @xcite , leading them to invoke non - instantaneous starburst / star - formation activity in a series of events .",
    "so we are brought back to the question of what triggered the vigorous star formation episode that apparently peaked in the past but is still ongoing today .",
    "we have investigated three possible triggers : tidal forces from an external perturber , inherent central mass density concentration , and accretion of a smaller object .",
    "we found no nearby large or small perturbers , so it has apparently not been tidally triggered .",
    "vii zw 403 s mass does nt appear to be strongly centrally concentrated either , as evidenced by its optical scale length , lower central surface brightness , and lower  surface density than comparable bcds .",
    "this leaves us with an accretion event .",
    "there is evidence for accretion in some dwarf systems , including some local group dwarfs .",
    "compared to another suspected accretion / merger system ( ddo 26 ) , vii zw 403  has some similarities but less extreme signatures .",
    "of the three possible triggers we have investigated , this seems the most likely ; although the evidence is far from conclusive .",
