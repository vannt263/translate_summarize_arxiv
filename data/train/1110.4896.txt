    "note that @xmath85 .",
    "this ensures that there is a color that either does not appear in the in - neighborhood or does not appear in the out - neighborhood of @xmath54 , allowing us to complete the coloring .",
    "the core of the proof is probabilistic .",
    "we color the vertices of @xmath3 randomly with @xmath86 colors , @xmath87 .",
    "that is , for each vertex @xmath54 we assign @xmath54 a color from @xmath88 uniformly at random .",
    "after the random coloring , we uncolor all the vertices that are in a monochromatic directed path of length at least 2 .",
    "clearly , this results in a proper partial coloring of @xmath3 since @xmath3 has no digons . for each vertex @xmath54 , we are interested in the number of colors which are assigned to at least two out - neighbors of @xmath54 and are retained by at least two of these vertices . for analysis , it is better to define a slightly simpler random variable . let @xmath20 . for each color @xmath89 , @xmath90 , let @xmath91 be the set of out - neighbors of @xmath54 that have color @xmath89 assigned to them in the first phase .",
