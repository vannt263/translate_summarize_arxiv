    "observations with the euve satellite ( bowyer & malina @xcite ) have provided evidence that a number of clusters of galaxies produce intense euv emission , substantially in excess of the low - energy tail expected from the x - ray emission by the hot , diffuse icm at temperature of a few kev .",
    "euv excesses have been reported for virgo ( lieu et al .",
    "@xcite ) , coma ( lieu et al .",
    "@xcite ) , a1795 ( mittaz , lieu & lockman @xcite ) , a2199 galaxy clusters ( lieu , bonamente & mittaz @xcite ) , a4038 ( bowyer , lieu & mittaz @xcite ) and a4059 ( durret et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , although there is no doubt about the detection of the euv excess emission for virgo and coma clusters , considerable controversy still exists for the other clusters since euve results are affected by the variation of the telescope sensitivity over the field of view and depend also on subtraction of background signals that do not come from the cluster ( see berghfer & bowyer @xcite and durret et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the initial explanation for the euv excess emission was that it is produced by a warm ( @xmath2 k ) gas component of the icm ( lieu et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for virgo and coma clusters , bonamente , lieu & mittaz ( @xcite ) have proposed that hi cold clouds might have , at least in part , been released in the intergalactic space by ram pressure stripping . in this framework ,",
    "warm gas can be generated at the interface between the cold phase ( hi clouds ) and the hot icm , e.g. by the _ mixing layer _",
    "mechanism ( fabian @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting scenario is then a three phase gas model , where the hot and warm gas components are responsible for the bulk of x - ray emission and the soft excess emission , respectively , while the cold component accounts for x - ray absorption ( buote @xcite )",
    ".    models invoking the presence in galaxy clusters of the warm gas component have problems since they refer to unrelaxed or turbulent gas conditions : the longevity of such multiphase gas would then require the presence of a heat source to carefully balance the radiative cooling , but no obvious heating mechanisms have been found ( fabian @xcite ) . indeed , it is difficult for a warm intracluster gas to remain for a long time at @xmath3k since at this temperature the cooling function for a gas with solar chemical composition has a value @xmath4 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 ( saito & shigeyama @xcite ) implying for the m87 galaxy warm gas component with metallicity @xmath7 ( gastaldello & molendi @xcite ) and mean number density @xmath8 @xmath9 ( bonamente , lieu & mittaz @xcite ) a cooling time of about 150 myr .",
    "although strong evidence for cooling flows has been found in low - resolution x - ray imaging and spectra , high - resolution observations with the reflection grating spectrometer on the xmm - newton satellite show inconsistencies with the simple cooling flow models .",
    "the main problem is the lack of the emission lines expected from gas cooling below @xmath10 kev . )",
    ", the gas temperature ranges between 1 kev and 2 kev , so that the gas is not cold enough to justify the observed euv emission .",
    "] indeed , observations with both the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( dixon , hurwitz & ferguson @xcite ) and fuse ( dixonet al .",
    "@xcite ) found no significant far - uv line emission from gas at @xmath11 k. erg @xmath12 s@xmath6 sr@xmath6 for the @xmath13 line and @xmath14 erg @xmath12 s@xmath6 sr@xmath6 for the @xmath15 line .",
    "the absence of a significant far - uv line emission , which is expected from a warm gas component , is also confirmed by fuse observations not only for virgo but also for the coma cluster ( dixon et al .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "also the observation of a large number of clusters by the xmm - newton satellite ( tamura et al .",
    "@xcite ) detected no warm gas component .",
    "all these pieces of evidence seem overwhelming in the sense that a thermal mechanism for the euv excess can be ruled out .",
    "therefore , other mechanisms must be investigated as the source of the euv excess emission in clusters of galaxies .",
    "indeed , inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) photons by relativistic electrons present in the icm was proposed to explain the euv excess in the case of the coma cluster ( hwang @xcite , ensslin & biermann @xcite , ensslin , lieu & biermann @xcite ) .    here",
    ", we will examine in detail the case of virgo cluster , referring in particular to the results of a re - analysis of archival euve data for the central region of the cluster performed by berghfer , bowyer & korpela ( @xcite ) .    in fig",
    ". 2 of the above cited paper , the azimuthally averaged radial intensity profile of the background - subtracted euv emission in the central region of the virgo cluster ( centered in the m87 galaxy ) is given , as well as the contribution of the low - energy tail of the x - ray emitting hot icm .",
    "comparison between the two curves shows the presence of a diffuse euv excess which extends up to a radius of @xmath16 ( corresponding to @xmath17 kpc , for an assumed m87 distance @xmath18 mpc ) , in the m87 halo region .",
    "( lieu et al .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that ic scattering of cbr and starlight photons by a population ( hereafter denoted as population i ) of mildly relativistic electrons with energy up to a few hundred mev is able to account for the euv excess emission observed from the central region of the virgo cluster , centered in m87 galaxy . as we will see in section 2 , population i electrons have to be described by a power law energy spectrum with an energy cut - off at @xmath19 mev ( or slightly above ) in order to avoid both a hard , non thermal , x - ray excess ( due to ic scattering of cbr photons ) with respect to the upper limit of @xmath20 erg @xmath12 s@xmath6 in the 2 - 10 kev energy band , set by observations ( reynolds et al .",
    "@xcite ) and over - production of radio waves by synchrotron emission ( owen , eilek & kassim @xcite ) .",
    "the existence in the m87 galaxy of a highly relativistic electron population ( which we refer to as population ii ) is well demonstrated by the observations of large - scale radio emission in the 10 mhz - 100 ghz band ( owen , eilek & kassim @xcite ) .",
    "this radio emission is generally interpreted as synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons interacting with the halo magnetic field .",
    "to b exact , taking a value @xmath21 g as typical for the m87 halo magnetic field , one gets an electron energy range @xmath22 gev .",
    "population ii electrons have to be described with a power law energy spectrum with slope @xmath23 in order to fit the observed radio power law spectrum @xmath24 .",
    "electrons belonging to the same population ii , but with energy in the range @xmath25 gev , also could give rise to a hard , non thermal x - ray emission in the 2 - 10 kev region ( through ic scattering of cbr photons ) , but the resulting power is always negligible with respect to the upper limit quoted by reynolds et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "regarding the origin of population i and ii electrons , it is well known that the main source of non - thermal energy in the m87 galaxy is the active nucleus and jet .",
    "the current bolometric luminosity of the inner active region is @xmath26 erg s@xmath6 - mainly emitted in the radio band ( owen , eilek & kassim @xcite ) - although the kinetic power in the jet ( which matches with the nuclear power for accretion at the bondi rate ) is @xmath27 erg s@xmath6 ( di matteo et al .",
    "this is believed to be a lower limit for the total power available for particle acceleration , since the central engine would have had a cyclic activity with time scale of the order of 100 - 200 myr and today be in a quiescent phase ( owen , eilek & kassim @xcite ; corbin , oneil & rieke @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , simple lifetime considerations indicate that the available current energy content is at least @xmath28 erg . on the other hand , in the past",
    ", the m87 galaxy could have undergone a merging which would have made available a further energy budget ( as suggested for the coma cluster by blasi @xcite ) .",
    "this energy budget could be stored by accelerated protons that , being long - lived in the intergalactic medium ( with lifetimes of the order of a hubble time ) could be confined in the galaxy and then released part of their energy to electrons by coulomb and/or hadronic interactions ( see e.g. ensslin @xcite ) or by shock waves in plasma turbulence .",
    "the observed radio luminosity requires that the power emitted by population ii electrons is @xmath26 erg s@xmath6 . since the cooling time of these electrons",
    "is dominated by synchrotron losses with a time scale of @xmath29 s , one gets a population ii energy budget of @xmath30 erg , much less than the current available energy content .",
    "this implies that most of the total energy made available by the m87 nucleus could be stored in population i electrons .",
    "if these electrons are responsible for the euv excess emission by ic scattering of cbr and starlight photons , their power is about @xmath31 erg s@xmath6 , which multiplied by the ic cooling time @xmath32 s , gives a population i energy content close to that available .",
    "as far as the electron acceleration mechanism is concerned , it is expected that population ii electrons have been directly accelerated in the active nucleus and jet with high lorentz factors . indeed , the two lobes in the observed radio map trace on a large - scale the jet injection , keeping initially the direction of collimated outflows from the core . further diffusion by magnetic field inhomogeneities may give rise to a diffuse population ii component responsible for the overall radio emission .",
    "it is also known that the active nucleus and jet in the m87 inner region are responsible for inflating bubbles of accelerated cosmic rays which rise through the cooling gas at roughly half the sound speed ( churazov et al .",
    "shock acceleration at the bubble boundaries could give rise to population i electrons .",
    "finally we note that the existence for population i electrons of an energy cutoff at @xmath33 250 mev may be justified by considering that a time evolution for power - law spectrum injected electrons is expected as a consequence of transport , diffusion and cooling effects ( see petrosian @xcite for a detailed analysis for the coma cluster ) .    in section 2",
    "we calculate the euv source function for the ic scattering by relativistic electrons on cbr and starlight photons and the expected euv excess radial profile towards the m87 galaxy . in section 3",
    "we present our model results and address some conclusions .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we assume that population i electrons account for the large - scale euv excess in m87 galaxy through ic scattering of cbr and starlight photons .",
    "as far as the electron spatial distribution is concerned , despite evidence of granularity in the euv excess map of m87 ( fig . 5 in berghfer ,",
    "bowyer & korpela @xcite ) , here we adopt for simplicity a continuous radial profile as representative of an azimuthally averaged radial distribution of the observed structures .",
    "therefore , the electron density distribution @xmath34 as a function of the electron energy @xmath35 and the radial coordinate @xmath36 , in units of @xmath37 , is @xmath38^{3\\beta /2 } }           ~g(e_e ) } , \\label{diste}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 so that the integral number density in the energy band @xmath40 can be calculated as @xmath41 free parameters in eqs .",

    "the remaining parameters have to be determined in order to fit the observed euv excess radial profile in the energy band @xmath50 ev . to this end",
    "we make use of the well - known relation giving the ic scattered photon energy ( see e. g. lang @xcite ) @xmath51 in terms of the average energy @xmath52kt@xmath53 of target photons when a black body spectral distribution ( at temperature @xmath54 ) is assumed .    in our model the target photons",

    "coming back again to our model results , we find that the energy budget associated with the two electron populations is about @xmath131 erg ( mostly in population i electrons ) , which is always less or approximately equal to the total energy associated with thermal electrons .- model with @xmath132 , core radius @xmath133 kpc and temperature @xmath134 kev ( fabricant and gorenstein @xcite ) . moreover , the gas central number density is taken to be @xmath135 @xmath9 so that the total x - ray luminosity in the energy bands 0.2 - 4 kev and 2 - 10 kev turns out to be @xmath136 erg s@xmath6 and @xmath137 erg s@xmath6 , in accordance with the observed values ( forman and jones @xcite ) .",

    "however , further more accurate spectroscopic observations in both the euv and x - ray bands ( especially towards the external region of the m87 galaxy ) are necessary in order to confirm the presence of the two electron populations invoked in the present paper .",

    "<S> observations with the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) satellite have shown that the inner region of the virgo cluster ( centered in m87 galaxy ) has a strong extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) emission ( up to @xmath0 ) in excess to the low - energy tail expected from the hot , diffuse intracluster medium ( icm ) . </S>",
    "<S> detailed observations of large scale radio emission and upper limits for hard , non - thermal x - ray emission in the @xmath1 kev energy band have been also reported . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that all available observations can be accounted for by the existence of two electron populations ( indicated as i and ii ) in the m87 galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the mildly relativistic population i is responsible for the euv excess emission via ic scattering of cbr and starlight photons . </S>",
    "<S> population ii electrons ( with higher energy ) are instead responsible for the radio emission through synchrotron mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the same electrons also give rise to hard non - thermal x - ray emission ( via ic scattering of cbr photons ) , but the resulting power is always below the upper bounds placed by present observations . </S>",
    "<S> the non - negligible energy budget of the two electron populations with respect to that associated with thermal electrons indicates that the m87 galaxy is not today in a quiescent ( relaxed ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear activity and merging processes could have made available this energy budget that today is released in the form of relativistic electrons . </S>"
