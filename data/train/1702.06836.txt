    "core collapse supernovae ( sn ) offer a fascinating environment to study neutrino flavor evolution in dense environments . very recently , it was predicted that fast flavor conversions , occurring with a rate @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the neutrino density ) , can happen very near the sn core , as opposed to the well - known collective effects , occurring at @xmath2 km @xcite or the msw effect at @xmath3 km @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for this seemed to be a non - trivial angular distribution in the neutrino emission spectrum @xcite .",
    "based on these claims , we make a detailed study of these fast flavor conversions .",
    "we focus on regions _ close _ to the sn core and hence model the source as a flat geometry as shown in the left panel of fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "we redo the linear stability analysis(lsa ) with a physically well motivated angular emission spectrum , where the @xmath4 , which decouple later than the @xmath5 , have a larger flux and wider angular distribution than the latter .",
    "we study possible instabilities for neutrino flavor evolution in space as well as time , and for the first time , include backward going modes also .",
    "finally , we verify our lsa results with numerical results from the fully non - linear evolution .",
    "neutrino flavor evolution in a dense media is explained with space - time dependent wigner functions @xmath6 with momentum @xmath7 at position @xmath8 and time @xmath9 .",
    "the equation of motion ( eom ) is @xmath10\\nonumber \\,\\",
    ", \\label{eq : eom}\\ ] ] here we have neglected external forces acting on the system as well as collisions . the hamiltonian matrix is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the vacuum term with @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the matter term with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the electron density ; and @xmath17 is the multi - angle neutrino - neutrino interaction term .",
    "since the total number of neutrinos is always conserved , we can write     ( blue ) , @xmath18 ( red ) , and @xmath19 ( green ) emission fluxes .",

    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "also @xmath24 is the normalization of the differential spectrum @xmath25 , chosen accordingly .",
    "as neutrinos are produced as flavor eigenstates , no oscillation occurs as long as @xmath26 .",
    "we linearize the equations in this small parameter @xmath27 to get an eigenvalue equation @xcite @xmath28s_{{\\omega},v_z,\\varphi } \\nonumber\\\\                                                 & & - \\mu\\int d\\gamma'\\left(1-v_zv_z'-{{\\mathbf{v}}}_t.{{\\mathbf{v}}}_t'\\right)g_{{\\omega}',v_z',\\varphi'}\\,s_{{\\omega}',v_z',\\varphi'}\\ , , \\nonumber \\label{eq : stabeom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the velocity vector of the neutrino projected on the @xmath30-@xmath31plane .",
    "the important quantity here is the difference in the diiferential spectrum , given by @xmath32 for neutrinos and @xmath33 for antineutrinos . keeping in mind that the angular spectrum of emission should be different for neutrinos and antineutrinos , we choose the following schematic spectrum @xmath34\\,$ ] as shown in fig.[fig:2 ] ( middle panel ) . here",
    "@xmath35 denotes the neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry whereas @xmath36 controls the difference in zenith angle distribution .",
    "such a `` non - trivial '' angular emission spectrum seems to be crucial for fast conversion .    to solve the eigenvalue equation ,",
    "we take @xmath37 , where @xmath38 can take complex values .",
    "a non - zero positive @xmath39 causes an exponential growth in @xmath40 , thereby signalling an instability .",
    "it is important to mention that since we are looking for fast conversions , we can integrate out @xmath41 from the spectrum and effectively set @xmath42 .",
    "armed with this formalism , we look for instabilities for evolution in time @xmath43 and in space @xmath44 .",
    "we show a contour plot @xmath45 for different values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "a common feature of all these plots is that no fast conversion takes place if @xmath46 , thereby indicating that a non - trivial spectrum might be necessary for fast conversions .",
    "also , matter suppresses these growths .",

    "right panel shows the electron neutrino survival probabilities  @xmath47 for same values of @xmath35 and @xmath36.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] giving the extent of flavor conversion .",
    "right panel shows the electron neutrino survival probabilities  @xmath47 for same values of @xmath35 and @xmath36.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    similarly , in fig.[fig:4 ] , we plot the growth rates for @xmath48 .",
    "we also show similar instabilities for a spectrum including backward travelling modes as @xmath49 $ ] as shown in fig.[fig:2 ] ( right panel ) .",
    "we note that inclusion of backward going modes increases fast conversions .",
    "interestingly , matter suppression does not occur for time evolution , as suggested in @xcite . to verify our results from lsa",
    ", we have also solved the fully non - linear eoms for specific values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the results shown in fig.[fig:5 ] indicate that indeed complete flavor averaging takes place within a few nanoseconds .",
    "one is also led to speculate whether it is important to have a crossing in the angular spectrum for development of fast conversions , as is evident from all the above cases .",
    "further details are worked out in @xcite .",
    "thus we notice that for a non - trivial distribution of angular spectrum , we can indeed get rapid flavor turn - overs in time , even if in space the growth is suppressed by matter effects . also , backward travelling modes near the neutrinosphere aid in fast conversion .",
    "if these fast conversions indeed take place so near the sn core , they may have important implications for supernova explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis .",
