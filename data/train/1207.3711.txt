    "our first model is an extension of our previous work @xcite where we idealize the interior of a spherical void as a uniform underdense region and the surface of the sphere contains a randomized distribution of galaxy halos with navarrofrenkwhite ( nfw ) profiles @xcite .",

    "fixed the parameters of the voids and halos .",
    "even though neither of these models represent realistic matter distributions within a void , they should capture the main qualitative features of lensing .      in section",
    "ii , we give a detailed description of the nfw halo density profile that we adopt which is motivated by observations .",
    "we also describe our two models of the entire distribution of matter , including both large scale void structures and smaller scale halo structures .",
    "in section iii , we review the method we use to compute the distribution of lensing magnifications .",
    "we then describe how to compute the lensing convergence for a single halo .",
    "we compare our numerical results for the distribution of magnifications with analytic expressions .",
    "we also estimate the number of realizations required to get a reasonable accuracy in the computed distribution of magnifications ( e.g , obtain the mean of the distribution to an accuracy of @xmath5 ) . the accuracy of the numerical results scales as @xmath6 as expected , where @xmath7 is the number of realizations .",
    "in section iv , we study our first swiss cheese model .",
    "we start by describing the model , and study the propagation of light rays through just a single void .",
    "then , we derive analytic results for the magnification and use these to check our numerical results .",
    "we study the expected number of halo intersections , the redshift dependence of the magnification distribution , and determine the contribution of shear to our results .",

    "we show that the redshift dependence of the mean and standard deviation agrees with analytic results to @xmath9 .",
    "we also note that the standard deviation changes by less than @xmath10 if shear is neglected ( see section iv c below ) .",
    "one effect which our models do not include is the clustering of halos , that is , the correlations between the locations of different halos . while it would be more realistic to include the effects of clustering , our simplified models should capture the essence of the effects of large scale inhomogeneities .    in section",
    "v , we study the second swiss cheese model . again , we first describe the model and study just a single void .",
    "we derive analytic results for the lensing convergences and use these to check our numerical results .",
    "there is a higher probability of demagnification ; this shift is expected because the density contrast inside the void is now sharper because it is empty ( with a smattering of a small number of halos ) whereas the first model has a smooth interior matter distribution .",
    "the redshift dependence of the mean and standard deviation of the second model are similar to those of the first model . in the two models we consider ,",
    "the standard deviations of this distribution are 0.065 and 0.072 magnitudes and the means are -0.0010 and -0.0013 magnitudes , for voids of radius 35 mpc , sources at redshift 1.5 , with the voids chosen so that 90% of the mass is on the shell today .",
    "we compare the distributions for configurations with and without voids for a source at @xmath11 .",
    "we find that the voids do not significantly change the variance but do significantly change the demagnification tail and the mode .",
    "we find that since the distribution is skewed , the mode is positive , while the variance is determined primarily by rays that intersect halos .",
    "the scale of the voids does not significantly influence our results .",
    "the main parameters that determine the mode and variance of the distribution is the mean column depth and concentration of halos and the fraction of the mass density that is in the form of halos ( as opposed to smoothly distributed ) .",
    "the distribution of halos in space ( i.e. , in the interior versus the surface ) is unimportant .",
    "hence , our models bracket the range of possibilities of magnifications .",
    "our analysis is generally consistent with other analytic and computational results @xcite .",
    "we also compare our results to those of kainulainen & marra @xcite who use a similar but slightly different simplified model of large scale structure .",
    "we model the galaxy halos with an nfw profile @xcite , with a density distribution    @xmath12    here @xmath13 is the proper spherical radial coordinate , @xmath14 is the physical radius which defines the core of the halo where most of the mass is concentrated , @xmath15 the ratio of the radius of the halo to the core radius @xmath14 , and the parameter @xmath16 is determined by the total mass of the halo .",
    "the corresponding total halo mass is @xmath17 for all our simulations we use @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "ii , the intersection probability remains about the same as in the previous model .",
    "the change due to the addition of a few halos in the vast interior region is negligible .",
    "the expected number of halo intersections @xmath21 is given by eq .",

    "we see the same qualitative features as in srn for the corresponding redshift but all the distributions are shifted towards demagnification .",
    "the horizontal lines are the 25% ( top ) , 50% ( middle ) and 75% ( bottom ) quartiles of the distribution from the peaks . ]",
    "next we explore the bias ( i.e. , the mean of the distribution ) due to halos and voids for sources at various redshifts , namely , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 . to compute the shear in this case , for the void contribution we use eq .",

    "( [ 3p4.18 ] ) - ( [ 3p4.20 ] ) , we sum over both the surface and interior halos .",
    "the magnifications shown in figure 10 are predominantly due to halos while the mostly empty interior has a demagnifying effect . due to the increased underdensity inside the void , the magnitudes shift towards demagnification .",
    "the standard deviation for @xmath11 is @xmath37 .",
    "again we note that the modes are larger than the means and also shift towards the demagnification end of the plot with increasing redshift .",
    "the tails of these distributions are similar to the ones obtained in the srn model in figure 4 .",
    "next we consider the mean magnitude shift , @xmath38 , and its mode , @xmath39 , in the two models .",
    "the key feature here is that the underdense interior is more prominent in the srr model .",
    "we expect that the mean magnitude shift and its mode should shift and the difference in the means should increase with redshift . in figure 11 , we plot the means and modes for the two models and we show that @xmath38 for srr is @xmath40 greater than that for srn at @xmath41 .    , for the two models .",

    ", the underdense region will be composed of both halos and an ambient intergalactic medium . by studying the completely smooth interior case ( srn ) and the completely granular interior case ( srr )",
    ", we expect to bracket the true distribution .",
    "for simulations in srr ( solid ) , the srn model ( dot dashed ) , for comoving voids of radius r = 35 mpc with @xmath30 today .",
    "also shown is the model with uniformly distributed halos everywhere and with no voids ( dashed - this is the @xmath44 limit of the srr model ) with source at redshifts of @xmath33 .",
    "the distributions are similar in the srr models because the expected number of halos intersected is independent of of the radial distribution of halos , where as the distribution in the srn model is qualitatively similar but is shifted towards negative magnifications . ]",
    "previous studies in the literature have modeled the magnification effects of only voids @xcite or only halos @xcite , while other studies have considered very specific models with a particular distribution of filaments and halos @xcite . in our work ,",
    "we present two models that incorporate the effects of both halos and voids",
    ". we have considered cosmological models where at large scales matter evolves to cluster on the edges of spherical voids .",
    "one limit of our model is the case where there are no halos on the surface and the interior is composed entirely of halos .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath44 limit of the srr model , a `` no void limit '' . in figure 12",
    ", we compare the magnification distribution we obtain for this configuration for @xmath11 to the corresponding distribution in the srr and srn models , for comoving voids of radius r = 35 mpc with 90% of the void mass on the shell today . from eq .",
    "( [ 3p5.1 ] ) , the expected number of halo intersections in the srr model is independent of the radial distribution of the halos and hence the srr and no void distributions should be similar , as observed .",
    "however , in the srn model the number of halo intersections is lower due to the smaller number of halos .",
    "hence the distribution is shifted towards negative magnification shifts .",
    "in this paper , we presented two simple models to study the effects of both voids and halos on distance modulus shifts due to gravitational lensing .",
    "our results may be useful for future surveys that gather data on luminosity distances to various astronomical sources to constrain properties of the source of cosmic acceleration .",
    "the core of our model is constructed by considering a @xmath0cdm swiss cheese cosmology with mass compensated , randomly located voids , while our small scale halo structures are non - evolving and chosen to be all the same size and with an nfw matter profile .",
    "we used an algorithm , described in @xcite , to compute the probability distributions of distance modulus shifts .",
    "the mean dispersion of the magnitude shift due to gravitational lensing due to voids and halos is @xmath1 times larger than due to voids alone with a shell thickness , @xcite ; the dispersion @xmath45 due to 35 mpc voids and halos for sources at @xmath46 is @xmath47 ( depending on the model ) .",
    "the mean magnitude shift due to voids and halos is of order @xmath48 to @xmath49 ( depending on the model ) .",
    "these values of @xmath50 imply that large scale structure must be accounted for in using luminosity distance determinations for estimating precise values of cosmological parameters , such as those characterizing the dark energy equation of state .",
    "we studied the distribution of magnitude shifts for three different source redshifts in each of our models .",
    "the qualitative dependence on redshift is similar to that of the previous void - only models @xcite .",
    "we find that the voids do not significantly change the variance but do significantly change the demagnification tail and the mode .",
    "the mode lies on the demagnification side and the variance is largely due to halo intersections .",
    "the scale of voids is unimportant and the only discernable effect in the mode is seen when the void interior is smoothly distributed matter . as a result ,",
    "our models bracket the range of possibilities of magnifications .",
    "our simple and easily tunable model for void and galaxy halo lensing can be used as a starting point to study more complicated effects .",
    "for example , one can use various algorithms to generate realizations of distributions of non - overlapping spheres in three dimensional space .",
    "given such a realization one could use the algorithm of this paper to study correlations between magnifications along rays with small angular separations , which would be relevant to future small beam surveys @xcite .",
    "finally , our model is in general agreement with other simplified lensing models in the literature that focus on lensing due to both halos and larger scale structures , @xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath50 in the srn void model are represented within about 20% by an analytic model presented in detail in appendix b. this model ascribes the magnitude shift entirely to the fluctuations in light beam convergence that results from passage through underdense cores and overdense halos ; thus it ignores the contribution from shear , which we have found to be relatively small empirically .",
    "the final result for @xmath51 is a sum of these two contributions .",
    "[ see eqs .",
    "( b20 ) and ( b22 ) ] .",
    "although our simulations assumed a single halo mass @xmath52 , radius @xmath53 and concentration @xmath15 , and a single void radius , the analytic model allows distributions for these key quantities .",
    "the contribution from halos is proportional to a suitably weighted mean of @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is defined in eq .",
    "( b16 ) and is displayed in fig .",
    "the contribution from the underdense void cores is proportional to the mean void radius .",
    "typically , the contribution to @xmath51 from halos is much larger than the contribution from void cores so @xmath51 is larger for more massive or more compact halos .",
    "we have seen that the results of our simulations depend on whether the underdense core consists of smoothly distributed dark matter ( srn ) or is itself clumped into halos ( srr ) . in the extreme case",
    "in which the underdense core is entirely made of halos , the results do not depend on the core density , and is equivalent to the sr model that consists of halos distributed randomly within a void .    although the analytic model was only developed for the srn model , it could also be applied to the srr model with any prescription for the fraction of the mass of the underdense core that is clumped into halos .",
    "for example , in the extreme case of total clumping we can use the analytic models in appendix b with the substitution @xmath56 for all @xmath57 in all expressions derived there . for intermediate cases , a prescription for the fraction of the underdense core that remains smooth rather than clumped would be needed .",
    "this research was supported at cornell by nsf grants phy-0968820 and phy-1068541 and by nasa grant nnx11ai95 g .",
    "in this appendix , we describe how we calculate the column density encountered by rays passing through halos in the srn model . in our model for the voids , we break up the bounding shell of mass into halos with mass @xmath58 .",
    "as a light ray passes through one of these halos , the beam will acquire some integrated column depth , @xmath59 , where the random variable @xmath60 depends on the impact parameter of the beam with respect to the halo center , @xmath61 is the density profile of the halo and @xmath62 is the physical coordinate . the maximum value is for a beam going right through the center , and diverges for our nfw profile [ 3p2.1 ] .",
    "we use an nfw profile [ 3p2.1 ] , for the matter distribution in halos , and the column depth is @xmath63 where we have changed from radial ( in eq .",
    "( [ 3p2.1 ] ) ) to cartesian coordinates . here",
    "the physical impact parameter is @xmath64 and @xmath15 is the ratio of the radius of the halo to its core radius .",
    "this reduces to the sum of two contributions @xmath65 where the relationship between the column depth @xmath66 and the corresponding lensing convergence , @xmath67 , is , from eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) , @xmath68 the lensing convergences is listed in eqs .",
    "( [ 3p3.4 ] ) and ( [ 3p3.5 ] ) .",
    "again , the contribution from outside a radius of @xmath69 is zero .",
    "the mean column density of halos is defined as @xmath70    for the halos , even more important that @xmath60 is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 ; this is because the probability distribution for @xmath73 is @xmath74 , and therefore the probability distribution for @xmath60 for a single halo is @xmath75 this is the quantity plotted in figure 1 .",
    "in this appendix , we derive analytic results for the standard deviation of magnifications . consider the mean of the contribution to the convergence ( 3.1 ) from the underdense core of the @xmath76-th void , which we will denote by @xmath77 .",
    "we find @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the comoving radius of the void , @xmath80 is the scale factor and @xmath81 is the fraction of the total void mass on the surface at redshift @xmath82 . after averaging over impact paramters",
    "we obtain @xmath83 and therefore the net expected convergence from voids is @xmath84 assuming a typical radius @xmath85 , there are about @xmath86 terms in the sum , and consequently the overall average is @xmath87 . in the limit",
    "that there are many voids along a given line of sight , we can replace the sum by an integral .",
    "the number of voids per interval @xmath88 of comoving distance is @xmath89 , and therefore if we define @xmath90 we find @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93",
    ". equation ( b4 ) does not depend on any void properties ( apart from the value of @xmath94 today ) and remains valid if there is a distribution of void sizes , for example .",
    "we assume statistical independence of halos within voids from the core ( i.e. , true if halo radii are small ) and also of voids from one another .",
    "the overall variance is a sum of individual halo and core variances . as in our simulations",
    ", we neglect clustering of halos , which would introduce correlations among them , and assume that dark matter is confined to the halos and underdense core .",
    "these assumptions could be relaxed in a more sophisticated model .",
    "we see that @xmath97 @xmath98 since the averages for @xmath99 vanish .",
    "the sum is @xmath100 and therefore @xmath101 .",
    "let us now consider halos residing in void @xmath76 .",
    "we include the possibility that there are different types of halo with different properties , and label the types by @xmath73 . for a given halo @xmath102 of type @xmath73 passed through by the line of sight at physical impact parameter @xmath103 relative to its center ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath95 is @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the physical halo radius , and @xmath106 is the physical density within the halo .",
    "the average over impact parameters @xmath103 is @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the total halo mass .",
    "therefore the average over impact parameters through a given halo is @xmath110 if all of the halos reside in the voids ( i.e. , none in the frw exterior ) , then the expected number of intersections of the light path with a halo is @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the expected number of halos of `` type @xmath73 '' in the void , and we take account of the fact that @xmath105 is a physical radius .",
    "then we get a total contribution from halos per mass - compensated void equal to @xmath113 the sum is the total mass in halos , which must compensate the underdensity , so @xmath114 and therefore @xmath115 therefore the average per mass - compensated void cancels as expected .",
    "this cancellation is actually independent of the distribution of halos within the void but depends on the assumption that all halos are associated with voids .",
