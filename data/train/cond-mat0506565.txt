    "ever since the discovery of aggregation of cyanine dye molecules by jelley  @xcite and scheibe  @xcite the width of the absorption band of these linear aggregates ( the j - band ) has attracted much attention . at low temperatures , the j - band may be as narrow as a few tens of @xmath3 s ( for pseudoisocyanine ) , while at room temperature it typically is a few hundred @xmath3.@xcite the small width at low temperature is generally understood as resulting from the excitonic nature of the optical excitations,@xcite which leads to exchange narrowing of the inhomogeneous broadening of the transitions of individual molecules.@xcite as the optically dominant exciton states in inhomogeneous j - aggregates occur below the exciton band edge , their vibration - induced dephasing is strongly suppressed at low temperatures .",
    "thus , the j - band is inhomogeneously broadened , except for a small residual homogeneous component ( @xmath4 0.1 @xmath3 ) caused by spontaneous emission of the individual exciton states underlying the spectrum . upon increasing the temperature ,",
    "the vibration - induced dephasing of the exciton states increases , the j - band broadens , and obtains a more homogeneous character .    over the past twenty years",
    ", the temperature dependence of the j - band width and the homogeneous broadening of the exciton states , has been studied by several authors . in 1987 , de boer , vink , and wiersma  @xcite performed accumulated - echo experiments to study the temperature dependence of the pure dephasing time in j - aggregates of pseudo - isocyanine bromide ( pic - br ) and found that within the temperature range 1.5 k to 100 k , this time is linearly proportional to the occupation number of a mode with an energy of 9 @xmath3 .",
    "they assigned this to a librational mode of the aggregate .",
    "later on , fidder , knoester , and wiersma  @xcite ( see also ref .   and  ) showed that a similar study carried our over a wider temperature range , 1.5 k to 190 k , required the occupation numbers of three vibration modes , at 9 @xmath3 , 305 @xmath3 , and 973 @xmath3 . using the hole burning technique , hirschmann and friedrich",
    "@xcite studied the homogeneous width of the exciton states in pseudoisocyanine iodide ( pic - i ) over the temperature range 350 mk to 80 k. they were able to fit their measurements by a superposition of two exponentials , with activation energies 27 @xmath3 and 330 @xmath3 , and they attributed the broadening to scattering of the excitons on an acoustic mode and an optical mode , respectively , of the aggregate .",
    "finally , in 1997 renge and wild  @xcite measured the temperature dependent width , @xmath5 , of the total j - band of pseudoisocyanine chloride ( pic - cl ) and fluoride ( pic - f ) over the wide temperature range 10 k to 300 k. they found that over this entire range their data closely obeyed a power - law dependence @xmath6 with the exponent @xmath7 .",
    "they suggested the scattering of the excitons on host vibrations as a possible source of this behavior .",
    "the above overview clearly demonstrates that the temperature dependence of the most important characteristic of j - aggregates , namely the j - band , is not understood .",
    "it even is not clear what is the source of thermal broadening : dephasing due to vibrational modes of the aggregate itself or due to modes of the host matrix . theoretically , the study of the exciton dephasing in j - aggregates is complicated by the fact that static disorder plays an important role in these systems , as is clear from the strongly asymmetric low - temperature lineshape",
    ".  @xcite the simultaneous treatment of disorder , leading to exciton localization , and scattering on vibrational modes , is a problem that requires extensive numerical simulations .",
    "such simulations have been used previously to model the optical response of polysilanes ,  @xcite the temperature dependent fluorescence  @xcite and transport  @xcite properties of j - aggregates , and single molecular spectroscopy of circular aggregates .",
    "@xcite alternatively , stochastic models have been applied to describe the scattering of excitons on vibrations in disordered aggregates and the resulting spectral line shape  @xcite and relaxation dynamics .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we report on a systematic theoretical study of dephasing of weakly localized frenkel excitons in one - dimensional systems , focusing on the effect of the scattering of the excitons on the vibrational modes ( phonons ) of the host . for a chain - like configuration",
    "it seems physically reasonable to assume that the coupling to host vibrations dominates the dynamics of the excitons . for coupling to vibrations in the chain ,",
    "one expects self - trapped exciton states ,  @xcite for which in most aggregates no clear signature is found .",
    "we describe the phonons by a debye model and consider one - phonon as well as ( elastic and inelastic ) two - phonon contributions to the dephasing .",
    "the scattering rates between the various , numerically obtained , exciton states are derived using the fermi golden rule . due to the disorder , the dephasing rates of individual exciton states are distributed over a wide range , in particular at low temperature , making it meaningless to associate the width of individual exciton levels with the j - band width .",
    "rather , this width is determined by direct simulation of the total absorption spectrum and is found to scale with temperature according to a power law .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the hamiltonian for excitons in a disordered chain and coupled to host vibrations .",
    "general expressions for the exciton dephasing rates are derived in sec .",
    "[ dephasing ] .",
    "section  [ homogeneouslimit ] deals with the temperature dependence of the dephasing rates for the disorder - free case , where analytical expressions can be obtained . in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] we give the results of our numerical simulations for the dephasing rates in the presence of disorder and analyze their temperature dependence and fluctuations as well as the total j - band width .",
    "we compare to experiment in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] and discuss an alternative mechanism of dephasing due to the coupling of excitons to a local vibration .",
    "in section  [ concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider an ensemble of j - aggregates embedded in a disordered host matrix .",
    "the aggregates are assumed to be decoupled from each other , while they interact with the host .",
    "a single aggregate is modeled as an open linear chain of @xmath8 coupled two - level monomers with parallel transition dipoles .",
    "the interaction between a particular monomer and the surrounding host molecules in the equilibrium configuration leads to shifts in the monomer s transition energy . due to the host s structural disorder",
    ", this shift is different for each monomer in the aggregate , giving rise to on - site ( diagonal ) disorder .",
    "moreover , vibrations of the host couple to the aggregate excited states , because the associated displacements away from the equilibrium configuration dynamically affect the monomer transition energies .",
    "accounting for these shifts up to second order in the molecular displacements , the resulting hamiltonian in the site representation reads :    [ h ] @xmath9 with @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13    here , @xmath14 is the bare frenkel exciton hamiltonian , with @xmath15 denoting the state in which the @xmath16th monomer is excited and all the other monomers are in the ground state .",
    "the monomer excitation energies , @xmath17 , are uncorrelated stochastic gaussian variables , with mean @xmath18 and standard deviation @xmath19 , referred to as the disorder strength .",
    "hereafter , @xmath18 is set to zero .",
    "the resonant interactions @xmath20 are considered to be nonrandom and are assumed to be of dipolar origin : @xmath21 @xmath22 , with @xmath23 denoting the nearest - neighbor coupling .",
    "@xmath24 describes the vibrational modes of the host , labeled @xmath25 and with the spectrum @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the operator @xmath28 annihilates ( creates ) a vibrational quantum in mode @xmath25 . finally , the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 describe the linear and quadratic exciton - vibration coupling , respectively , where the quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 indicate their strengths .",
    "we do not derive explicit expressions for these coupling strengths , as we aim to treat them on a phenomenological basis .",
    "in particular , owing to the disordered nature of the host , we consider these strengths stochastic quantities , for which we only specify the following stochastic properties with respect to the site index @xmath16 :    [ vv ] @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35    where the angular brackets denote averaging over realizations of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the kronecker symbol in eqs",
    ".  ( [ < v1v1 > ] ) and  ( [ < v2v2 > ] ) implies that the surroundings of different monomers in the aggregate are not correlated .    in general , the hamiltonian eq .  ( [ h ] )",
    "can not be diagonalized analytically .",
    "if the exciton - vibration coupling is not too strong , the method of choice is first to find the exciton eigenstates by numerical diagonalization and then to consider the scattering on the basis of these eigenstates .",
    "explicitly , the exciton states follow from the eigenvalue problem    [ diagonalization ] @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the eigenenergy of the exciton state @xmath39 : @xmath40    in the exciton representation , the exciton - vibration interactions take the form    [ v1v2 ] @xmath41 @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the matrix elements of the vibration - induced scattering of an exciton from state @xmath45 to state @xmath46 , given by    [ v1qv2q ]",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48    spectroscopic data on j - aggregates clearly reveal that the exciton - vibration coupling in these systems is usually weak . for the prototypical j - aggregates of pic",
    ", this claim is corroborated by two facts : ( i ) - the narrowness of the j - band , which only is a few tens of @xmath3 at liquid helium temperature and becomes several times broader at room temperature , and ( ii ) - the absence of a fluorescence stokes shift of the j - band ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the extended nature of the exciton states in j - aggregates helps to reduce the exciton - vibration coupling , as it leads to averaging of the static as well as dynamic fluctuations of the site energies , effects known as exchange  @xcite and motional  @xcite narrowing , respectively .",
    "the weakness of the exciton - vibration coupling allows one to calculate the scattering and dephasing rates of the excitons through perturbation theory .",
    "this analysis is presented in the next section .",
    "following the arguments given at the end of sec .  [ model ] , we will use fermi s golden rule to calculate the rate for scattering of excitons from one localized state , @xmath45 , to another one , @xmath46 .",
    "the result reads @xmath49 here , the superscript @xmath50 distinguishes between one- and two - vibration - assisted exciton scattering .",

    "this behavior results from the @xmath71-dependence of the density of states of acoustic phonons , combined with the fact that in the long - wavelength limit @xmath72.@xcite one may consider this a debye - like model , in which one replaces the summation over the mode index @xmath25 by an integration over the frequency @xmath26 according to the well - known rule : @xmath73 here , @xmath74 is an irrelevant constant , which we will incorporate in an overall free parameter ( see below ) , and @xmath75 is a cutoff frequency .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath75 is not necessarily related to the debye frequency : the generally very complex density of vibrational states in a disordered solid may on average exhibit an @xmath71 scaling up to a given frequency @xmath75 .    inspired by the above",

    "interestingly , it turns out that while the temperature dependence of the j - bandwidth is sensitive to the overall frequency scaling of the spectral density , it is not sensitive to fluctuations of this scaling around an average power - law . to demonstrate this ,",
