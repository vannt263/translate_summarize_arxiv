    "substantial efforts on behalf of the scientific community have been recently addressed to the experimental assessment and theoretical investigation @xcite of the response of living cells to ultrashort ( sub - nanosecond ) intense ( mv / m ) electromagnetic field pulses ( see also @xcite for a tutorial ) .",
    "cell exposure to pulsed em fields in the msec-@xmath0sec range is known to produce transient or permanent permeabilization ( electroporation @xcite ) of the cytoplasmic membrane , depending on pulse amplitude , through a peculiar breakdown phenomenon occurring when the transmembrane potential difference exceeds some critical level ( @xmath11v ) .",
    "cell response to _ ultrashort _ pulses is markedly different .",
    "basically , the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane is _ not _ directly affected , although the transmembrane potential difference may largely exceed the poration breakdown threshold .",
    "substantial permeabilization of the organelles , including the nucleus is observed instead , usually triggering an apoptotic response ( signaled , e.g. , by externalization of phosphatidylserine @xcite ) , which eventually ( typically several minutes after exposure ) leads to membrane dissolution and cell remnants removal by macrophages .",
    "such a mechanism may hold a potential for cancer treatment @xcite .",
    "in fact , effective selective destruction of several types of tumors , including skin melanomas and colorectal carcinomas ( two of the big killers ) , up to complete remission , have been reported after suitably tuned ultrashort em pulse exposure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this mechanism of action differs completely from that of microwave hyperthermia @xcite , where tumor necrosis is induced by selective heating of the neoplastic tissue .",
    "exposure to ultrashort pulses , on the contrary , does _ not _ produce any sensible macroscopic thermal response , nor ( killing the cells through apoptosis ) an inflammatory response . in order to understand the underlying physical mechanisms , it is necessary to develop a model providing a good tradeoff between simplicity and realism .",
    "most studies are based on the cell model proposed by schwan et al .",
    "@xcite-@xcite consisting of a single spherical cell ( extracellular medium , plasma membrane and cytoplasm ) whose electromagnetic constitutive parameters are treated as frequency independent . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the membrane specific capacitance is _ strongly _ frequency - dependent @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we investigated the thermal response of a simple cell model ( spherical homogeneous , with frequency dependent membrane capacitance ) to a pulsed - electromagnetic field by solving the coupled electromagnetic and heat - diffusion problems .",
    "our findings suggest that whenever the pulse duration is small compared to the thermal relaxation constant of the cell membrane , and the membrane capacitance drops to its low asymptotic high - frequency value in the pulse spectral bands , one may observe a steep increase in the membrane temperature , up to physiologically significant levels , the average ( cytoplasm ) temperature remaining essentially unaffected .",
    "similar conclusions were obtained in @xcite following a more sophisticated approach which combines smoluchowski equation to describe membrane response , the heat equation and molecular dynamics simulations , to gauge the impact of localized membrane heating on membrane poration .",
    "+ in this paper we extend the analysis of @xcite to the more realistic case where the cell is part of a bio - tissue . we also adopt a more general cell model consisting of four radially nested domains ( nucleus , nuclear membrane , cytoplasm and plasma membrane supposed concentric ) , including frequency dependence of both the plasma and nuclear membranes . in the paper",
    "the membrane capacitive models used do not depend on voltage , this implies that the analysis holds only when the external electric fields are not strong or long enough to create membrane pores .    in order to solve the pertinent electromagnetic boundary value problem , in the quasi - static limit",

    "the model considers densely but separated ( no geometric / electric contact ) cells in the tissue . the short duration ( nanosecond ) of the pulsed em field results in a negligible spatial diffusion of the temperature field .",
    "in this approximation , cells can be considered thermally independent and the condition ( 54 ) , ensuring absence of thermal flow , can be consistently used .",
    "a more accurate thermal evolution , taking into account also transport phenomena ( due to thermoregulation ) , and the study of the cells geometric disposition effect on the thermal tissue dynamic , are out of the scope of this paper and will be faced in future works .",
    "it is interesting to note in this simplified model that by using short , large - amplitude pulses , whose spectral content overlaps significantly the membrane capacitance dispersion band , and whose duration is shorter than the membrane thermal diffusion time , one may observe fast membrane localized heating ( the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm temperatures being essentially unaffected ) .",

    "one possibility could be to use a laser beam to probe the mechanical normal modes of the membrane before and after pulsed excitations , to check the expected permanent change in membrane stiffness due to membrane protein denaturation . whether the above findings may bear any relevance to explain , even in part ,",
