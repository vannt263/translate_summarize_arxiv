    "additive number theory is the branch of arithmetic that studies particular subsets of integers ( such as arithmetic progressions , prime numbers or squares ) and their behavior under addition .",
    "a typical class of problems in this area concerns determining which positive integers can be expressed as sums of elements of a fixed subset of integers . in this aspect , one of the earliest results of additive number theory is lagrange s four square theorem , stating that every non - negative integer can be expressed as sum of four squares .",
    "another classical problem is the diophantine frobenius problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , that asks for the greatest integer that is not representable as a linear combination with non - negative integer coefficients of elements of a subset of integers . in connection to both topics , it is interesting to understand which numbers are representable as sum of large squares . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the largest number that can not be represented as a sum of squares of integers greater than a fixed @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we answer affirmatively a conjecture of dutch and rickett ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , stating that the greatest integer that is not expressible as a sum of squares of integers greater than or equal to @xmath2 grows like @xmath3 , namely we prove the following result :    [ dr ] let @xmath4 be the set of integers that can be expressed as a finite sum of squares of integers greater than or equal to @xmath2 , and denote by @xmath5 the greatest integer not belonging to @xmath4 . then @xmath6 .",
    "finally we ask a question related to the representation of an integer as a sum of four large squares .",
    "denote by @xmath7 the set of non - negative integers .",
    "since @xmath3 and @xmath8 are relatively prime for any @xmath9 , @xmath10 , then sylvester s formula ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) states that every integer greater than or equal to @xmath11 $ ] can be written as a non - negative linear combination of @xmath3 and @xmath8 , thus the set @xmath12 is finite .",
    "recently it has been proved ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that the greatest integer that is not representable as a non - negative linear combination of @xmath13 is of order @xmath14 . concerning our problem",
    ", it is known that @xmath15 for any @xmath16 ( cf .",
    "we estimate @xmath5 by focusing on representations that involve the least possible number of squares .",
    "the well - known four square theorem , due to lagrange , states that every positive integer can be written as a sum of four squares .",
    "furthermore , if we denote by @xmath17 and by @xmath18 the sum of divisors of @xmath2 that are not divisible by @xmath19 , in 1828 jacobi proved that @xmath20 is equal to @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "let @xmath22 stand for the sum of divisors of @xmath2 .",
    "notice that if @xmath9 is such that @xmath23 then @xmath24 , hence for @xmath25 , @xmath23 we get that @xmath26 .",
    "therefore it makes sense to ask for representations as sum of four relatively large squares .",
    "however , the elements of the infinite set @xmath27 can not be expressed as sum of four non - zero squares ( see @xcite , chapter 6 , theorem 3 ) . taking that into account",
    ", we pose the following question :    [ fourlarge ] is there @xmath28 in @xmath7 such that for every @xmath2 in @xmath7 there exists @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and for each @xmath31 either @xmath32 or @xmath33 ?    note that if such @xmath28 exists then , for every @xmath9 , every positive integer @xmath34 is a sum of four squares contained in the set @xmath35 : hence @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is easy to see that such a @xmath28 can not be less than @xmath38 ( by taking @xmath39 ) , and computational evidence suggests that @xmath40 affirmatively answers question [ fourlarge ] .",
    "we are going to give a partial answer to this question by proving that such a @xmath28 must exist , in order to prove our main theorem .",
    "consider now the @xmath19-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath41 @xmath42 the representations of @xmath2 as sum of four integer squares correspond to the integral points of @xmath43 .",
    "question [ fourlarge ] is thus related to the distribution of these integral points over the sphere @xmath43 .",
    "this problem has been widely studied in literature in the more general context of quadratic forms : it has been proved ( cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem 11.5 ) that for an arbitrary quadratic form @xmath44 if @xmath45 then the vectors @xmath46 with @xmath47 are asymptotically equidistributed as @xmath48 over integers satisfying the congruence @xmath49 .",
    "we will now explain the meaning of the words  asymptotically equidistributed \" .",
    "first , points on @xmath43 scale concentrically to points of the unit sphere @xmath50 .",
    "thus we can study the distribution of integral points over @xmath43 by considering the distribution of the associated scaled points of @xmath50 .",
    "for this purpose we define , for a domain @xmath51 , @xmath52 that is the number of integral points of @xmath43 that scale to points of @xmath53 . with this notation , by ",
    "asymptotically equidistributed \" we mean that if @xmath54 is a convex domain with smooth boundaries on @xmath50 , then @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the normalized surface area of @xmath54 ( assuming @xmath57 ) .",
    "notice that , if we consider the quadratic form @xmath58 , then by lagrange s four square theorem for every integer @xmath2 there exists @xmath59 such that @xmath47 , thus the congruence @xmath60 admits solutions for every @xmath9 ; this consideration allows us to discard this constraint in the following .",
    "this lemma partially answers question [ fourlarge ] :    [ point ] let @xmath2 be a squarefree integer .",
    "then , for @xmath2 sufficiently large , there is an integral point @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .",
    "notice first that for @xmath2 squarefree we have @xmath23 , hence @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "considering the domain @xmath65 we have @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath67 , therefore on squarefree integers the sequence @xmath68 is asymptotic to a sequence that is larger than @xmath69 , so the values of @xmath68 must be strictly positive for sufficiently large squarefree @xmath2 , and this implies our thesis .    a consequence of lemma [ point ] is :    [ partial ] there exists a positive constant @xmath28 such that for every squarefree positive integer @xmath2 there is an integral point @xmath61 such that if @xmath70 then @xmath33 .    by lemma [ point ]",
    "there exists @xmath71 such that for every squarefree positive integer @xmath72 there is an integral point @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "therefore there is at most a finite set @xmath73 of squarefree positive integers for which that property should not hold .",
    "however , by lagrange s four square theorem there should be an integral point @xmath74 on the sphere @xmath75 for every @xmath76 .",
    "define now for every @xmath76 the constant @xmath77 let now @xmath78 . then for every squarefree positive integer @xmath2 we have that there is an integral point @xmath61 such that whenever @xmath70 we have @xmath79 , thus concluding our proof .",
    "now we are ready to prove the main theorem .",
    "let @xmath9 , let @xmath28 be as in lemma [ partial ] and take @xmath80 .",
    "suppose that @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is squarefree . by lemma",
    "[ partial ] there is an integral point @xmath84 on the sphere @xmath85 such that if @xmath70 we must have @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath87 we have @xmath88 , and @xmath89 whenever @xmath90 .",
    "thus @xmath91 .",
    "this implies @xmath92 , hence @xmath6 .",
    "theorem [ dr ] states the existence of a bound for @xmath5 : however , in the proof it is not explicited how large the _ sufficiently large _",
    "@xmath2 should be to satisfy lemma [ point ] , and thus we can not define explicitly the constant @xmath28 of lemma [ partial ] , although the existence of such @xmath28 is sufficient for proving our main result . here , we provide computational evidence that question [ fourlarge ] might be satisfied by considering @xmath40 .    [ even ]",
    "if there is an even positive integer @xmath2 such that @xmath93 is the minimal value of @xmath28 such that question [ fourlarge ] holds , then there is an infinite set of positive integers such that @xmath93 is the minimal value of @xmath28 such that question [ fourlarge ] holds .",
