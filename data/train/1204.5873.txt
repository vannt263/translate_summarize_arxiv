    "[ ] the following two unbinned clustering algorithms are used to search for neutrino point sources ( signal ) in the sky map of atmospheric neutrinos ( background ) . the _ expectation - maximization _",
    "algorithm is based on an analytically likelihood maximization  @xcite .",
    "the signal density distribution is assumed to be a two - dimensional gaussian and the background density distribution is taken from the data . the probability to have a signal for a given background model",
    "is maximized .",
    "the free parameters are the two sigmas of the two - dimensional gaussian probability density function and the expected number of signal events from the source .",
    "the _ likelihood algorithm _ calculates first the angular distance between a fixed source search point and the location of all selected neutrinos in the sky .",
    "then it fits this distribution with signal and background density distribution using maximization technique .",
    "the signal distribution is the point spread function taken from monte carlo and the background distribution is taken from data .",
    "a set of cuts have been optimized to search for an @xmath0 neutrino flux in the data sample taken in 2007 with a livetime of 140 days .",
    "an all sky point source search based on the above algorithms has not revealed any significant excess for any direction .",
    "no significant excess has been found also in a dedicated search from a selected list of 24 promising neutrino source candidates .",
    "the upper limits on the neutrino flux from the 24 candidate sources are shown in figure [ fig : plot ] .",
