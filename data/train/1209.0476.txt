    "star formation in galaxies proceeds at maximum efficiency in systems undergoing major mergers @xcite .",
    "given the well - established hierarchical structure formation paradigm , where larger structures form from the merging of smaller objects , it is tempting to infer that this  merging mode \" of star formation contributes significantly to the build - up of stellar mass across the galaxy population , especially at high redshift .",
    "however , recent observations downplay the importance of violent events such as merger - induced starbursts in the global star formation budget of the universe , even at @xmath13 @xcite .    instead , the existence of a tight relation between stellar mass and star formation rate , followed by star - forming galaxies up to at least @xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggests that star formation is mainly regulated by secular processes with much longer duty cycles . to make further progress in understanding the histories of galaxies , we therefore need to investigate how processes such as minor mergers , bar formation and bulge growth influence the star formation process , both in terms of its onset / shutdown and of its efficiency .",
    "the first question to answer is thus , how do these mechanisms contribute to switching star formation on / off in galaxies ?",
    "several studies have recently tackled this specific question , by looking for the observable that correlates best with quiescence .",
    "both observations and simulations suggest that quiescence is not strongly linked with stellar mass , but rather with structural and morphological parameters such as sersic index , stellar mass surface density , or central velocity dispersion @xcite . while there is mounting evidence for a link between star formation quenching and the presence of bulges , the direction of causality between them is as of yet not fully established .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that while a bulge - dominated morphology is necessary for quenching to occur , it is not sufficient in itself .",
    "the exact underlying physical mechanism(s ) responsible for the correlation between early - type morphologies and the absence of star formation has also yet to be unambiguously identified .",
    "we come back to this discussion in  [ bulges ] .    after having determined which galaxies are star - forming and which are quiescent , at least in a statistical way , the second question concerns the efficiency of star formation , across the galaxy population .",
    "the general picture is that a star - forming galaxy will convert a given amount of molecular gas into stars in a timescale of @xmath151 gyr when star formation proceeds in self - gravitating giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , while in a major merger this timescale is reduced by an order of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is however reasonable to expect that intermediate systems exist , where the global ( i.e. galaxy - wide averaged ) star formation efficiency is found to vary within this framework ( as suggested also by e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such situations could occur either in the onset of a major merger as the transition between the two modes of star formation occurs , or in systems subjected to milder processes where part of the star formation is occurring normally in gmcs , while at the same time more violent star formation is taking place in other unvirialized regions . for example , in the overlap region of the antennae galaxies , @xcite observe a bimodal distribution of molecular clouds , finding both a population of gmcs typical of nearby galaxies and a population of unusually large , massive , and efficiently star - forming clouds .",
    "@xcite also previously reported significantly different star formation efficiencies in different regions of the interacting galaxy arp 158 , and @xcite argue in general that accurate modeling of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) requires consideration of both a central dense , efficiently star - forming phase and a more diffuse disc - like component where star formation proceeds at a more modest pace .",
    "barred galaxies are examples of systems where the star formation process can be locally affected , as inward gas flows lead to increased central gas concentrations and star formation rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interactions with nearby companions can also induce gas flows that create high levels of star formation in the central regions of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , some galaxies appear to resist star formation , even in the presence of cold gas .",
    "this includes early - type , bulge - dominated systems , where the presence of large reservoirs of atomic gas in the form of disks is not rare ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "some of these early - type galaxies even have significant , mostly compact , h@xmath0 disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggested to be less efficient at forming stars than similar gas disks in normal star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , several resolved studies point out that conditions in the ism at the very centers of galaxies are different than in the disks , implying that the star formation efficiency is affected by the high stellar densities and/or the presence of agn @xcite .    here",
    ", we further investigate the link between structural parameters and star formation efficiency by looking directly at the cold gas component of galaxies .",
    "star formation is a local process , and is thus optimally studied with observations at the highest resolutions possible .",
    "our approach here is however different : by working with integrated galaxy properties and gas measurements , which can be measured in large unbiased galaxy samples , we can track the processes that have an influence on the global star formation efficiency of galaxies , and therefore the build - up of stellar mass at the present epoch .",
    "these results can then be linked to high resolution studies of specific objects , to better understand the small scale physics responsible for the star formation efficiency variations .",
    "we use data from the cold gass survey ( co legacy database for the _ galex_-arecibo - sdss survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which was specifically designed to conduct such statistical analyses .",
    "compared with other samples which , while of comparable sizes , targeted specific populations @xcite , cold gass provides the full picture of the local galaxy population , over the mass range @xmath1@xmath10@xmath4 .    after describing the sample and the data in  [ data ] ,",
    "we address in  [ results ] two questions left open in previous cold gass papers @xcite : ( 1 ) what is causing the molecular gas depletion time to vary across our sample ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the role of bulges in regulating and/or quenching star formation ? as a sensor of the instantaneous star formation potential of galaxies ,",
    "cold gas observations are a straightforward quantity that will help us answer these questions .",
    "a general interpretation of these results is presented in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "all rest - frame and derived quantities in this work assume a @xcite imf , and a cosmology with @xmath16 km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we have been conducting a full suite of surveys to characterize the stellar and gaseous contents of massive galaxies , in a sample selected to be representative of the entire galaxy population in the local universe with @xmath1@xmath10@xmath4 .",
    "the sample is selected in the redshift range @xmath20 from the sdss dr6 spectroscopic survey , in the area of sky that overlaps with the galex mis @xcite and the alfalfa hi survey @xcite .",
    "full details regarding the sample selection are given in @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the star formation rates ( sfrs ) are obtained by fitting the photometry in the seven optical - uv bands to a set of model galaxies derived from the @xcite code with a range of ages , star formation histories , metallicities and dust attenuations . for further details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we also use in the analysis two structural parameters often derived from sdss data to quantify the morphology of the galaxies .",
    "the first is the stellar mass surface density , defined as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the radius in kpc encompassing 50% of the petrosian flux in the sdss @xmath23band .",
    "the second parameter , concentration index , is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "it has been shown to correlate well with bulge - to - total ratios as determined by two - dimensional bulge / disk decompositions @xcite .",
    "out of the parent population of galaxies matching these selection criteria , a subset was randomly selected for cold gas observations . as detailed in @xcite ,",
    "atomic gas measurements are obtained with the arecibo telescope .",
    "the molecular gas masses come from observations of the co(1 - 0 ) emission line with the iram 30-m telescope .",
    "the sample used in this study includes the 222 galaxies that were part of the first cold gass data release , and the additional galaxies observed until the completion of the survey in 2011 november , for a total of 365  galaxies .",
    "a full description of the instrumental setup , observing strategy and data reduction procedure is presented in @xcite .",
    "we describe in   [ apcorr ] and [ gasmass ] the aspects of the process that differ from those used in previous cold gass studies .",
    "the cold gass sample is shown in figure [ ms ] in the sfr-@xmath1  plane . since the sample is purely mass - selected",
    ", it includes both star - forming and passive galaxies . in order to quantify gas scaling relations across the entire galaxy population , the sample selected for gas observations ( both hi and co )",
    "is constructed to have a flat @xmath1  distribution @xcite .",
    "additionally , in order to fully explore the sfr-@xmath1  plane , we have targeted objects with high sfrs per unit mass . in this study",
    ", we refer to the 365  galaxies with co measurements as the _ full sample _ ( at the moment , hi data are available for 320 of these galaxies ) .",
    "the full sample is meant to sample uniformly the entire sfr-@xmath1  plane , and as such has an excess of high mass galaxies , and of galaxies with high specific star - formation rates compared to a purely volume - limited sample .",
    "we also construct a _ representative sample _",
    ", by selecting a subset of objects from the full sample that matches the distribution of the unbiased , volume - limited parent sample in the sfr-@xmath1  plane .",
    "we adopted a grid in this 2-dimensional plane with cells of size 0.125 dex in @xmath1  and 0.2 dex in @xmath25 , and culled galaxies from the full sample so that the relative fraction of the sample in each grid cell matched that in the parent sample .",
    "the distributions of other important quantities such as concentration index and stellar mass surface densities , are also statistically equivalent between the parent sample and this representative subsample ( kolmogorov - smirnov probability , ks@xmath26 , greater than 0.8 that the @xmath27 and @xmath2  distributions are drawn from the same parent sample ) .",
    "we construct a set of 50 representative subsamples , an example of which is shown in figure [ ms ] . in the remainder of this paper , we explicitly mention whether the full or the representative sample is used .",
    "when the representative sample is used , we are able to assess the robustness of the results by comparing the significance of the results across the set of 50 repetitions .      in  [ results ]",
    ", we investigate different mechanisms that may affect star formation efficiency . because gas fractions and the depletion time depend on several global galaxy properties @xcite , it is not trivial to find a proper reference sample for any sub - population we wish to study ( for example , galaxies with strong stellar bars or hosting agn ) . in these cases ,",
    "we define a _ control sample _ of galaxies matched in some quantities , such that the effects of the mechanism under study on the depletion time can be assessed , everything else being equal . unless stated otherwise , we match the control samples on nuv@xmath28  color and stellar mass surface density , @xmath2 , using the technique described above .",
    "the control sample therefore shares the same distribution as the sample of interest in the the 2d plane defined by nuv@xmath28  and @xmath2 , the two quantities upon which atomic and molecular gas contents depend the most @xcite . for this reason",
    ", we must redefine a control sample each time we investigate a new sub - population of galaxies .      to correct the co fluxes measured in the 22  beam of the iram telescope to the total flux",
    ", we derive an aperture correction for each galaxy . in the first cold gass data release",
    ", we used a small sample of nearby galaxies with resolved co maps to derive a mean relation for the aperture correction as a function of @xmath29 , the sdss @xmath30band optical diameter .",
    "this method has the advantage of showing the range of aperture corrections that are possible at any given disk size @xmath29 , given the real variation in radial molecular gas profiles within the reference sample .",
    "however , it does not take into account the specific properties of each galaxy , including its disk inclination and light profile .    in this paper",
    ", we therefore use a new prescription to correct fluxes , similar in spirit to the method used by @xcite . for each galaxy with a co measurement ,",
    "we create a model galaxy having an exponential molecular gas distribution with a  half - light \" radius corresponding to @xmath31 , the radius encompassing 50% of the star formation as measured in the sdss/_galex _ photometry .",
    "this choice is based on the observation that co and sfr distributions trace each other well in nearby star - forming galaxies @xcite , even in the hi - dominated outer disc regions @xcite . the model is then inclined as the real galaxy , and we simulate an observation with the 22  iram beam .",
    "the ratio between this simulated observation and the total flux of the model galaxy is adopted as the aperture correction .",
    "for the more face - on systems , these values are perfectly consistent with the previous estimates . only in the most inclined systems",
    "do we find aperture corrections on average 15% smaller .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty in this process is the assumption that the gas profiles are exponential .",
    "resolved maps of co in nearby galaxies indicate that this assumption is generally valid : molecular gas profiles are observed to be exponential , with the co and sfr scale lengths equivalent , both of which being proportional to the stellar scale lengths @xcite , albeit with some scatter especially at small radii @xcite . at fixed disk inclination , we observe differences of at most 15 - 20% in the values of @xmath7  obtained with aperture corrections derived from the method described above , and aperture corrections measured from the azimuthally - averaged observed sfr profile of each galaxy .",
    "lisenfeld et al .",
    "( 2011 ) estimate a 30% uncertainty on their aperture corrections obtained from a similar disk modeling technique ( see their figure 3 ) . based on our tests and this independent estimate",
    ", we adopt a general uncertainty of 20% on the aperture corrections .",
    "accounting also for the uncertainties in the measurement of the co line fluxes , in the flux calibration at the telescope , and in the conversion factor @xmath32  ( see  [ gasmass ] ) , we estimate a global error of @xmath33 dex on our values of @xmath7 , with the error budget largely dominated by the systematic uncertainty on @xmath32  @xcite .      the other difference with the procedure described in @xcite is the choice of the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor , @xmath32",
    "we have previously adopted a galactic value of 3.2 @xmath4(k km  s@xmath17  pc@xmath34)@xmath17 for all the galaxies in our sample , which did not take into account the contribution of helium .",
    "we now include this correction , and therefore use @xmath32@xmath35 @xmath4(k km  s@xmath17  pc@xmath34 ) for normal star - forming galaxies . among the full sample used in this study ,",
    "there are however galaxies undergoing major mergers . in such cases",
    ", it has been suggested that a value of 1.0 @xmath4(k km  s@xmath17  pc@xmath34)@xmath17 is more appropriate @xcite , and we follow this convention .",
    "to avoid biasing the results of this study , it is preferable not to tie the choice between the galactic and  merger \" @xmath32  to a visual classification .",
    "instead , we wish to use a quantitative measure of the properties of the interstellar medium to make this choice . while infrared luminosity is directly connected to merging activity in the most extreme cases ( ultraluminous infrared galaxies and sub - millimeter galaxies , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is no one - to - one correlation between a high infrared luminosity ( @xmath36 ) and the need for a low value of @xmath32 , nor between morphological signs of merging and enhanced star formation activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the high densities found in mergers may lead to both elevated dust temperatures and lower values of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "we therefore choose dust temperature , as parametrized by the @xmath37 iras flux ratio , to guide our choice between galactic and  merger \" @xmath32 . based on a sample of galaxies for which independent measures of @xmath32  are available @xcite",
    ", we choose a value of @xmath38 as the threshold to determine @xmath32  ( gracia - carpio et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we therefore apply a conversion factor of @xmath32@xmath39 @xmath4(k km  s@xmath17  pc@xmath34)@xmath17 to all galaxies with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the galactic value of @xmath32@xmath35 @xmath4(k km  s@xmath17  pc@xmath34)@xmath17 otherwise . of the 365  galaxies in the sample ,",
    "11 match this criteria and use the lower value of @xmath32 .",
    "we note that within our survey volume , iras was sensitive to galaxies with @xmath42 , therefore this convention to assign @xmath32  does not bias against part of the sample , even though only 15% of the cold gass galaxies have good quality flux measurements at both 60 and 100 @xmath43 m . in  [ appendix2 ] , we show that key results of this study are robust against this specific choice of @xmath32 .",
    "we have already reported variations in both molecular gas mass fraction ( @xmath44@xmath45 @xmath7@xmath46 @xmath1 ) and depletion time ( @xmath47@xmath48 @xmath7@xmath46sfr ) across the cold gass sample in the mass range @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "these observations are summarized in figure [ msoff ] .",
    "we however improve here on our previous results by using stacking to calculate mean values of @xmath47  and @xmath44 , allowing us to include both co detections and non - detections in the analysis .",
    "we compute these mean values in six bins of offset from the star - formation main sequence , calculated as : @xmath50 adopting the main sequence definition of @xcite .",
    "the different @xmath51(ms ) bins are defined at fixed intervals , and illustrated in figure [ ms ] . since the @xmath1-sfr relation is almost linear , @xmath51(ms ) is almost equivalent to variations in specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) .    to measure the mean depletion time of a given subsample",
    ", the stacking is done directly in  depletion time units \" .",
    "that is , all multiplicative factors required to convert an observed co line flux into a @xmath47  value were applied to each spectrum prior to stacking .",
    "this includes all the standard factors from the @xcite prescription ( their equation 2 ) , but also the appropriate value of @xmath32  ( see  [ gasmass ] ) , sfr@xmath17 , and a weight to correct for the flat stellar mass distribution of our sample ( the methodology for this is described in * ? ? ?",
    "after stacking these scaled spectra , the mean depletion time is obtained by integrating over the resulting line profile , selecting by hand the spectral window over which the flux is integrated to reflect the effective line width in the stacked spectrum .",
    "this effective line width is seen to increase from @xmath52 to @xmath53 km  s@xmath17  going from low to high @xmath2  or @xmath27 , as these quantities correlate with @xmath1 , which in turn correlates with circular velocity .",
    "similarly , we obtain mean values of @xmath44  by stacking in ",
    "mass fraction units \" ( i.e. using a @xmath1@xmath17 scaling instead of sfr@xmath17 ) .",
    "this is the same technique used by @xcite to derive mean gas fractions from stacking , and further details can be found in that reference .",
    "the only difference in methodology is that we do not weigh the spectra by their rms noise prior to stacking .",
    "applying such weights would cause severe biases as the rms noise in the individual iram spectra is correlated with the underlying properties of the galaxies as a result of our survey strategy . since we integrate",
    "until a galaxy is either detected in co at @xmath54 or a sensitivity to a gas mass fraction @xmath44=0.015 is reached , gas - rich galaxies and those at the smaller distances have spectra with higher rms than gas - poor and more distant objects . applying a weight derived form this rms noise would therefore heavily bias against gas - rich objects .",
    "figure [ msoff]a shows that the mean value of both @xmath47  and @xmath44  varies as a function of @xmath51(ms ) .",
    "passive and weakly star - forming galaxies have low gas contents and long depletion times , while the most actively star - forming galaxies have higher gas contents and shorter depletion times .",
    "this is consistent for example with the conclusion of @xcite that the increased star formation rate in interacting galaxies is due to both increased molecular gas mass and increased star formation efficiency .",
    "the cold gass sample shows over a much broader range of galaxy types that changes in the molecular gas mass fraction can not alone account for the full amplitude of ssfr variations ; compare the black dashed line and the solid gray line in figure [ msoff]a .",
    "the mean star formation efficiency must also vary , and the stacking analysis indeed reveals that it increases by a factor of @xmath55 in the mean between passive galaxies in the red cloud and actively star - forming galaxies above the main sequence ( see the magenta line in fig .",
    "[ msoff]a ) .    what causes @xmath47  to vary between galaxies above , on and under the star formation main sequence ? in  [ appendix2 ]",
    "we argue that these changes are not caused by our choice of the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor .",
    "studies of large optical datasets both at low and high redshift however indicate that other important physical parameters vary smoothly as a function of distance from the star - formation sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and suggest that structural parameters quantifying bulge prominence are critical in setting the star formation properties of galaxies , or lack thereof .",
    "we confirm in figure [ msoff]b , c that indeed our measures of  bulginess \" , the concentration index @xmath27 and the stellar mass surface density @xmath2 , do vary with @xmath51(ms ) , and in the next sections investigate the link between these structural parameters and star formation efficiency variations .",
    "the importance of structural parameters ( or morphology ) in setting the gas properties of galaxies has previously been recognized .",
    "for example , there are thresholds in @xmath27 and @xmath2  above which the detection rate of both hi and co drops significantly @xcite .",
    "as also shown in @xcite , the @xmath56@xmath2  plane is particularly efficient at separating the quenched population from the gas - rich , star - forming galaxies . for this reason",
    ", we refer to the critical values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath4  kpc@xmath5 as  quenching thresholds \" .",
    "these critical values , determined from the gas properties of the galaxies , agree well with similar thresholds in stellar population or morphological indicators .",
    "for example , a concentration index of 2.6 corresponds to the transition between the late- and early - type galaxy populations , as reported by studies which compared this indicator to traditional visual morphologies , quantitative bulge / disk decompositions , and stellar population indicators ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarly , a stellar mass surface density of @xmath59 @xmath4  kpc@xmath5 was identified by @xcite as marking the transition between galaxies dominated by young and old stellar populations . in comparison ,",
    "stellar mass is a poor quantity to separate the gas - rich from the gas - poor populations @xcite .    in figure [ thresh ] , galaxies with cold gas mass fractions above the sensitivity limits of our surveys ( @xmath60 )",
    "are color - coded according to their @xmath47(panel a ) or their @xmath61(panel b ) .",
    "this shows clearly that the galaxies with the longest values of @xmath47  and @xmath61  have high concentration indices and high stellar mass surface densities .",
    "it therefore appears that bulge - dominated , high stellar mass density galaxies either ( 1 ) have very little cold gas , either atomic or molecular , or else ( 2 ) tend to be inefficient at converting into stars the molecular gas they do have .",
    "care must be taken in interpreting this last observation . since at high",
    "@xmath2  and @xmath27 the detection rate of co and hi is low , the galaxies we are detecting will tend to be the most gas - rich at fixed sfr , and therefore those having the longest depletion times . while it can be unambiguously concluded from figure [ thresh ] that the longest values of @xmath47  and @xmath61  are only found in bulge - dominated galaxies , this",
    " malmquist bias \" means that we can not conclude from figure [ thresh ] alone that the _ mean _ depletion time is longer in bulge - dominated galaxies . to circumvent this issue",
    ", we can use stacking over representative samples of galaxies with co and hi spectra in order to include both detections and non - detections in the analysis .",
    "the mean values of @xmath47  and @xmath61   are shown as a function of @xmath27 and @xmath2  in figure [ stacksco ] .",
    "the stacking analysis confirms that both h@xmath0 and hi depletion times are longer in galaxies with high @xmath27 and @xmath2 , even when including the co and hi non - detections .",
    "the specific behaviour of @xmath47  and @xmath61  as a function of @xmath27 and @xmath2  is however different .",
    "the molecular gas depletion time increases steadily with @xmath27 and @xmath2  in the regime of disc - dominated galaxies located on or around the star formation main sequence ( @xmath62 , see fig .",
    "[ stacksco]c , d ) , and reaches a maximum value in the mean when reaching values of @xmath27 and @xmath2  characteristic of bulge - dominated galaxies . in contrast , @xmath61  increases more slowly at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , but then suddenly reaches a value close to a hubble time for the bulge - dominated galaxies , located well below the star formation main sequence .",
    "an interpretation of these trends is presented below in  [ bulges ] .",
    "it is already established that in systems well above the main sequence of star - forming galaxies in the sfr-@xmath1  plane , @xmath47  is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the normal star - forming population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the local universe ,",
    "these are the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , most of which ( if not all ) are major mergers @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we speculated in @xcite that milder dynamical effects , such as minor mergers and bar instabilities , could lead to more modest , yet measurable variations in the global @xmath47 .",
    "we have now also established that @xmath47  is longer in bulge - dominated galaxies than in star - forming disks , which may be interpreted in this same framework by an increased stability against star formation . in this section ,",
    "we address the question of the impact of interactions and bars on star formation efficiency , and come back to the role of bulges in  [ bulges ] .    whereas major mergers with mass ratios close to unity are very rare in the local universe , the cold gass sample includes a fair number of objects undergoing milder dynamical perturbations which may be affecting their star formation efficiency .",
    "the analysis here focuses on galaxies with bars , and on those displaying signs of interactions or morphological irregularities .",
    "we use the classification of wang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to identify galaxies with strong bars , defined as having ellipticity @xmath65 .",
    "not only is the identification of such bars robust , these are the kinds of bars that are linked to nuclear starbursts ( see wang et al .",
    "2012 for the full details ) .",
    "two different approaches are then used to identify interacting or otherwise disturbed galaxies .",
    "first , we use a set of quantitative morphological parameters measured by @xcite for the gass sample , following the technique of @xcite .",

    "this is consistent with previous findings that mergers can not all be identically associated with episodes of active star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "as detailed below , we find that while agn may affect the amount of molecular gas in their host galaxies , the star formation rate is also reduced , leaving the depletion time unchanged ( or if anything _ reduced _ ) as compared with a properly - matched control sample .",

    "the most important conclusion of this section in the context of this work is that the high incidence of agn in bulge - dominated galaxies can not explain why @xmath47  is longer at high concentration index and @xmath2 .",

    "the key observations presented in this work can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "both the molecular gas mass fraction ( @xmath44 ) and depletion time ( @xmath47 ) vary across the sfr-@xmath1  plane .",
    "galaxies above the star - forming sequence have both higher @xmath44  and shorter @xmath47 .",
    "conversely , explaining the low specific star formation rates of galaxies below the star - forming sequence requires both @xmath44  to decrease and @xmath47  to increase .",
    "2 .   the bulge - dominated galaxies in the sample , identified by their large concentration indices or their high stellar mass surface densities ( @xmath6 , @xmath2@xmath97@xmath4  kpc@xmath5 ) either have no cold gas down to the limit of our survey , or else are on average inefficient at converting into stars the molecular gas they do have . despite the fact that molecular gas in early - type galaxies has high surface densities just like in normal star - forming discs , we find their mean @xmath47  to be twice as long .",
    "the atomic gas depletion time is also longer in bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "3 .   at fixed",
    "@xmath2  and color , galaxies hosting agn have lower molecular gas mass fractions than their control sample , at all values of the eddington ratio probed by our sample .",
    "there is tentative evidence that the depletion timescale of the molecular gas is either unchanged or lowered in the presence of an agn , but not increased , indicating that active nuclei are not the main agent responsible for the long depletion times in bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "4 .   among the gas - rich , disc - dominated population ,",
    "galaxies undergoing merging events or having disturbed morphologies have the shortest depletion times , on average a factor of 2 shorter compared to matched control samples .",
    "not all mergers or interactions are however associated with episodes of particularly efficient star formation .",
    "global molecular gas depletion times are only mildly shorter in galaxies hosting strong stellar bars , everything else being equal .",
    "even though resolved gas studies show that bars can lead to enhanced nuclear star formation efficiency , the effect is not strong enough to significantly affect the _ global _ depletion time .",
    "we derive the star formation law for an unbiased sample of galaxies , representative of the local population with @xmath1@xmath10@xmath4 .",
    "this relation has a slope of @xmath11 , consistent with previous studies ; the @xmath47  variations manifest themselves as structure within the scatter around this best - fit relation , with bulge - dominated galaxies falling systematically below the mean relation .",
    "we now discuss these results , addressing the two main questions posed in the introduction , and comparing them to previously published work .",
    "our results confirm previous observations that the transition from star forming to quiescent galaxies is correlated with the presence of a bulge , as quantified either by stellar mass surface density , sersic index , velocity dispersion , or concentration index ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while there is still some debate as to which of these measures of  bulginess \" correlates best with quiescence ( for different views on this , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , various studies generally agree that stellar mass is a poorer diagnostic to separate star forming from quiescent galaxies .",
    "our results bring additional weight to these previous studies , since they are based on cold gas measurements , a direct tracer of the instantaneous potential of a galaxy to form stars , rather than on indicators such as color , which are averages over the different star formation history of each galaxy .",
    "structural parameters such as @xmath2  and @xmath27 do not only correlate with quiescence , but also with star formation efficiency .",
    "these physical quantities are therefore at the core of this question . only in galaxies with lower @xmath2",
    "do we see the dynamical processes that can significantly increase star formation efficiency . at the other extreme ,",
    "high central concentrations may lead to reduced star formation efficiency or complete quenching of the star formation .    the single quantity that may link these observations is the dense molecular gas fraction .",
    "we speculate that while @xmath47  ( measured from co(1 - 0 ) line fluxes ) varies across our sample , were we to measure a depletion time for the dense gas , it would show significantly less scatter .",
    "a commonly used dense gas tracer is the hcn(1 - 0 ) line , with observations showing that the hcn(1 - 0)/co(1 - 0 ) ratio is increased in efficiently star - forming galaxies like lirgs @xcite , and possibly reduced in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "we caution however that although the hcn / co ratio appears to be a signpost for the star forming dense gas fraction , it is not a perfect tracer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed ,",
    "hcn is a minor species subject to the abundance of nitrogen and the details of the chemical network ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and its ( 1 - 0 ) transition is sensitive to the specific physical excitation conditions with mid - infrared pumping possibly playing a role @xcite . other possibilities to trace the dense star - forming gas would be the hco@xmath98(1 - 0 ) transition , or higher rotational transitions of e.g. co , hcn or hco@xmath98 .",
    "theoretical and numerical work also supports this picture .",
    "@xcite find that a line with a high critical density like hcn(1 - 0 ) traces well the efficiently star forming gas between galaxies with different global properties . on the other hand , they find that a lower density tracer like co(1 - 0 ) tracks regions with various star formation properties from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "with high resolution hydrodynamic simulations , @xcite find the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the local gas density in mergers to be broader and shifted to higher densities ( or perhaps to have a different functional form ) , compared to the mostly log - normal pdfs found in normal star - forming galaxies @xcite . they conclude that these variations in the dense gas fractions at different stages of a merger cause galaxies to go from having  normal \" @xmath47  before the interaction begins , to having short @xmath47  at the peak of the merging activity ( resulting in the merger sequence in the kennicutt - schmidt plane ) .",
    "the end product of these mergers , early - type systems with some amount of dense molecular gas left , are somewhat inefficient at forming stars and have longer than average @xmath47 .",
    "this scenario explains well the location of the various galaxy types on the cold gass ks relation ( fig .",
    "[ ks ] ) .      in early simulation work",
    ", @xcite pointed out that galaxies with significant spheroidal components are more stable against fragmentation than pure disks .",
    "since fragmentation introduced by gravitational instabilities is a key element of star formation , the natural conclusion may be that bulges can therefore reduce star formation efficiency .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the stability parameter , @xmath99 @xcite , which in the case of gas@xmath100stars systems can be extended to include the two components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as confirmed by observations @xcite .",
    "specifically , a gas disk , which would be otherwise unstable , can be made stable by a significant stellar bulge . under the framework",
    "presented above , long depletion times in bulge - dominated galaxies would therefore result from a gas density pdf shifted to lower densities than in normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "we note that the effect of a stellar component on the stability of a gas disk could however be reversed in galaxies with lower stellar masses than those in the cold gass sample , when stars are distributed in a disk without a significant central concentration . in that case",
    ", higher stellar mass surface densities could translate into a shorter depletion time , as argued for example by @xcite .",
    "as seen in figure [ ks ] , bulge - dominated galaxies fall systematically below the mean molecular kennicutt - schmidt relation , indicating that at fixed gas surface density , they are less efficient at forming stars .",
    "the observation is in line with the scenario presented above , in which massive stellar bulges can stabilize gas disks , therefore reducing the star formation efficiency .",
    "although this mechanism is not sufficient in itself to make star - forming galaxies  red and dead \" , it may be efficient at keeping already - quenched galaxies on the red sequence , by preventing further star formation even in the event of late - time cold gas accretion @xcite . in massive galaxies , radio - mode agn feedback may be the most important agent in keeping galaxies on the red sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the contribution of the bulge in the reduction of the star formation efficiency could however be an important effect in lower mass galaxies where agn are not prevalent .",
    "interestingly , we also find the longest values of @xmath61  in galaxies above the  quenching thresholds \" ( @xmath6 and @xmath2@xmath97@xmath4  kpc@xmath5 , see fig .",
    "[ thresh ] ) , although in this case the reason may be different , and the different behavior of @xmath47  and @xmath61  as a function of @xmath2  hints at changes in the bottleneck of the star formation process across the local galaxy population . in high density bulge - dominated galaxies ,",
    "the atomic gas depletion time increases significantly .",
    "this suggests that these galaxies have large reservoirs of hi gas , presumably located in the outer disk , that do not participate in the star formation process . in this regime ,",
    "the bottleneck for star formation is the transport of this atomic gas to regions of higher density where the atomic - to - molecular conversion ( and hence star formation ) takes place efficiently . at stellar mass surface densities characteristic of disc - dominated galaxies",
    ", @xmath61  has a mean value of @xmath101 gyr with large galaxy - to - galaxy variations @xcite , but increases slowly with @xmath2  and @xmath27 similarly to @xmath47 . on average",
    ", there is therefore no accumulation of atomic gas , the conversion to co(1 - 0)-detectable molecular gas proceeding unimpeded .",
    "the @xmath47  variations then come about as galaxies have different fractions of their molecular gas in efficiently star - forming dense cores .",
    "this interpretation is supported by our observation that even among galaxies with low stellar mass surface densities , the ones undergoing merging , or to some extent those hosting a strong stellar bar , have the shortest co - based @xmath47 .",
    "since bulge - dominated galaxies preferentially host agn , it has been suggested that the correlation between quenching and the presence of a bulge may be a consequence of the feedback from the agn .",
    "if this were the case , there should be differences in the gas contents of galaxies with and without agn , everything else being equal .",
    "compared to a control sample matched in @xmath2  and color ( either global nuv@xmath28  or central d@xmath102(4000 ) ) , galaxies hosting an agn with @xmath103}/\\sigma^4<-2 $ ] have lower molecular gas mass fractions than inactive galaxies .",
    "this observation indicates a possible connection between agn activity and the quenching of star formation , although our sample does not include the stronger agn which are likely to contribute most to this process .",
    "galaxies with and without agn in our matched subsamples do not have statistically different mean values of @xmath47 , however , suggesting that the agn with modest accretion rates are not responsible for the long depletion times in bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "there is very marginal evidence that @xmath47  is even reduced in agn hosts , although the difference is not statistically significant in our sample which includes mostly liners .",
    "the non - result is in agreement with @xcite that report no difference in the hcn / co ratio between galaxies with and without agn , which in the framework of this discussion could explain why we do not observe variations in the co - based values of @xmath47  for agn hosting galaxies .",
    "the disconnect between nuclear properties and outer disk star formation explains why there is no correlation between agn activity and the generally extended hi contents of the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of this work is that global structural parameters , in this case concentration index and stellar mass surface density , are critical in establishing both the bimodality between gas - rich star - forming and gas - poor quiescent galaxies , and in setting the efficiency of star formation .",
    "star formation however is not purely a global process , as it depends strongly on small - scale physical conditions , which our integrated measurements can not track .",
    "significant work has however gone into measuring gas and star formation in nearby galaxies at the ( sub-)kiloparsec scale , with results , if taken at face value , that may appear at odds with the conclusions of this study ( e.g. * ? ? ? * who present evidence for a constant depletion time in nearby galaxies ) .",
    "the relation we observe between @xmath47  and the _ global _ stellar mass surface density may not apply at small scales , although figure 15 of @xcite indicates that the _ local _ mean depletion time in kpc - sized regions of nearby spirals increases by a factor of two over one decade in @xmath2   ( a similar effect can be seen in figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the global values of @xmath2  may not track the local conditions in individual sites of star formation , but rather the probability of incidence of various dynamical processes which can influence whether star formation proceeds  normally \" in virialized gmcs or rather in dense super star - forming complexes .    in a study of the resolved star formation law ,",
    "@xcite argue that star formation efficiency does not vary significantly within individual galaxies , with however significant galaxy - to - galaxy variations .",
    "even though this is consistent with the observations presented here , the interpretation is fundamentally different .",
    "indeed , @xcite ascribe the @xmath47  variations to a metallicity dependence of the conversion factor @xmath32 , while our analysis suggests that they are caused by actual changes in star formation efficiency .",
    "as detailed in the appendix , we do not find any evidence for metallicity or extinction to be the main driver of the observed @xmath47  variations . in the stellar mass range of the cold gass sample ( @xmath10@xmath4 ) ,",
    "the mass - metallicity relation is flat @xcite , implying that quantities such as @xmath2  and @xmath27 do not correlate with metallicity .",
    "however , toward the low mass end of our sample , and even more so at @xmath1@xmath104@xmath4 , the m@xmath105sfr ratio may very well be modulated simultaneously by variations in @xmath32  and actual changes in star formation efficiency . even after accounting for metallicity effects on @xmath32 ,",
    "high star formation efficiencies have indeed been reported for several low mass , low @xmath2  local galaxies where high resolution measurements of both gas and star formation are possible , for example m33 @xcite , ic10 @xcite , and ngc6822 @xcite ( see however the counter argument in the case of the smc in * ? ? ?",
    "disentangling the two effects will require both large statistical samples of low mass galaxies akin to cold gass , and resolved gas maps of galaxies spanning a broader range of properties .",
    "the main difference between our global results and those of studies focussing on the ( sub-)kpc scale may rather be more methodology - based . as pointed out correctly by @xcite ,",
    "resolved studies measure @xmath47  in regions of the galaxies where co is detected , but studies like ours include the total gas mass and the total star formation rate .",
    "the resolved measurements therefore teach us about star formation in the gas - rich gmcs and the global measurements about the total timescale for star formation , including any diffuse gas or star formation component .",
    "in particular , the global values of @xmath47  include star formation coming from the outer disks , regions where co is in general not detected in resolved maps and therefore not included in resolved studies . since star formation is known to be very inefficient in these outer regions ( @xmath61@xmath106 , * ? ? ? * ) , the relative contributions of outer disk star formation to the total value may be responsible for some of the galaxy - to - galaxy star formation efficiency variations , and the difference in absolute value of the mean depletion time reported in different studies ( in general a factor of @xmath9 higher in resolved studies ) .",
    "for example , @xcite find @xmath47@xmath107 gyr at the kpc scale in the smc , but @xmath47@xmath108 gyr for the entire galaxy , in line with the values we find in galaxies with low stellar mass surface densities .",
    "there are however arguments against the ",
    "outer disk effect \" interpretation .",
    "first , there is evidence that the molecular star formation law extends even in the hi - dominated outer regions of normal star - forming discs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . secondly , the metallicity gradients of galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath1@xmath10@xmath4  are remarkably flat out to the optical diameter @xcite , such that there is no evidence that the co measurements of cold gass galaxies are subject to radially - dependent @xmath32  variations .",
    "high resolution mapping of co in a broad range of galaxies will be necessary to further make the connection between local and global measurements . as the latter are most commonly available for high redshift systems , understanding this relation is critical .",
    "surveys like cold gass , offering homogeneously measured quantities over large , representative samples of galaxies are essential to identify the key populations where star formation efficiency is modulated , allowing us to understand the physical processes that are responsible for regulating the star formation budget of the local universe .",
    "for example , while bars can lead to nuclear starbursts and the formation of bulges , they are not responsible for increasing significantly the star formation efficiency over the local galaxy population .",
    "galaxy interactions and mergers however do have that effect .",
    "now that statistically - large samples are starting to be collected at high redshifts ( * ? ? ?",

    "one of the objectives of this work is to evaluate the impact of interactions on the star formation efficiency , requiring us to first identify the subset of cold gass galaxies undergoing such events . we do not wish to restrict the analysis to systems that can be classified as major mergers or that have massive companions , of the type that could be identified in the sdss spectroscopic database .",
    "instead , we choose to identify all the galaxies showing signs of morphological disturbances .",
    "@xcite measured for all the galaxies in the gass / cold gass survey two different quantitative morphology parameters , based on the approach of @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry parameter ( _ asym _ ) provides a measure of the difference between the sdss @xmath30band image and a copy of the same image rotated by 180@xmath109 .",
    "the larger the value of _ asym _ , the more asymmetric the galaxy .",
    "the second is the clumpiness parameter ( _ clump _ ) , computed from the difference between the original @xmath30band image and a copy of the same image smoothed to a scale of 20% of the petrosian radius .",
    "galaxies with clumpier morphologies therefore have larger values of _ clump_. two additional parameters are commonly used to quantify the morphologies of galaxies : the gini ( @xmath110 ) and @xmath111 parameters .",
    "the gini coefficient resembles the concentration index , but does not require the use of aperture photometry or the identification of the galaxy center , since it instead relies on the distribution of pixel values @xcite .",
    "it therefore performs well in very clumpy systems with ill - defined centers of light .",
    "the @xmath111 index is also akin to concentration , but again considers the full pixel distribution and therefore does not rely on the use of regular apertures @xcite .",
    "the sdss @xmath30band images are used to measure @xmath110 and @xmath111 for all cold gass galaxies .    to assess the performance of these four indicators at isolating the morphologically - disturbed systems we wish to study",
    ", we also perform a visual classification .",
    "galaxies are marked as  disturbed \" if they satisfy one of three criteria : ( 1 ) they have a companion within 1@xmath112 ( i.e. 30 - 60 kpc in our redshift interval of @xmath20 ) , ( 2 ) tidal features are visible , or ( 3 ) the stellar disks are lopsided or show strong asymmetrical features .",
    "the classification was done  blindly \" , without any knowledge of the value of the morphological parameters or any other physical properties of the galaxies that were inspected . as performed the classification twice , randomizing the order of the galaxies each time to avoid  fatigue biases \" .",
    "only galaxies consistently classified as disturbed in the two runs are flagged as such .    in figure [ morphparams ] the cold gass galaxies with a detection of the co line",
    "are shown in different diagnostic plots that combine the four morphological parameters ( _ asym , clump , g _ and @xmath111 ) .",
    "the @xmath113 plane was used by @xcite to identify major mergers .",
    "figure [ morphparams]b shows that their criterion ( @xmath114 ) does indeed pick up the most extreme systems , but not the full range of morphologies we wish to track .",
    "the visually - identified disturbed galaxies however cleanly separate from the rest of the sample in the _ asym - g _ and _ asym - clump _ planes ( figs .",
    "[ morphparams]a , c ) .",

    "these galaxies tend to have the smallest angular sizes ( @xmath116 ) or to have high inclinations ( @xmath117 ) , two situations where morphological classifications , both automated and visual , tend to be less reliable .",
    "the analysis presented in  [ highsfe ]",
    "is based on the visual morphological classification . to confirm that our observation of shorter molecular gas depletion times in morphologically disturbed galaxies is not simply the product of our classification scheme",
    ", we repeat the analysis shown in figure [ tdephists ] on the full sample with different selection criteria .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ testsclass ] .",
    "we compare the initial result ( panel a ) with the cases when either the morphological parameters are used to select disturbed galaxies ( panel b ) , or when we reject from the analysis the most edge - on galaxies , where classifications are uncertain ( panel c ) . in all cases , a ks test confirms with very high significance that @xmath47  is shorter in disturbed galaxies compared to the rest of the gas - rich population . even when restricting to the subsample with low stellar mass surface densities ,",
    "no matter how we define morphologically disturbed galaxies or whether or not we include edge - on galaxies in the analysis , we always find a ks probability @xmath118 that disturbed and un - disturbed galaxies have similar @xmath47  distributions .",
    "in other words , we confirm that low stellar mass surface densities are linked with lower than average @xmath47 , and that within this population , disturbed / interacting galaxies have the shortest depletion times .",
    "the total molecular gas mass is commonly derived from the measured co line luminosity using a conversion factor @xmath32  as @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is in ( k km  s@xmath17  pc@xmath34 ) .",
    "the exact value of @xmath32  and its possible dependence on a range of parameters including metallicity and density is being actively investigated , both with observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is also evidence for at least two sets of circumstances where @xmath32  departs significantly from the galactic value : low metallicity environments and the very dense central regions of merging systems .",
    "we investigated in @xcite the possibility that depletion time variations observed in the cold gass sample are caused by metallicity - induced changes in @xmath32 .",
    "while a few individual galaxies with @xmath1@xmath121@xmath4  may have a higher - than - galactic @xmath32 , we rule out the possibility that the observed @xmath47  variations across the sample are caused by such @xmath32  variations .",
    "the various prescriptions for the metallicity dependence of @xmath32  indicate that departures from the galactic value become measurable at @xmath122 ( see e.g. @xcite , but also @xcite for a stronger @xmath123-dependence , albeit at @xmath124 ) , while most cold gass galaxies have @xmath125 on the o3n2 scale of @xcite , adopting the solar abundance of @xcite .    for a subset of 196 cold gass galaxies , high quality nebular abundances are available from a companion optical spectroscopy observing program @xcite .",
    "in figure [ histz ] , the depletion time distributions are presented in three intervals of both luminosity - weighted , slit - integrated metallicity and extinction .",
    "the @xmath47  distributions for the three metallicity intervals are statistically equivalent , as confirmed by a ks test .",
    "this is to be compared with for example figure 10 of @xcite ; in our stellar mass range ( where metallicities are high and their gradients flat ) , the _ global _ values of @xmath47  do not depend on metallicity .",
    "models however suggest that an even better tracer of @xmath32  is extinction , as this quantity is the convolution of the metallicity and the volume density @xcite .",
    "we find that the galaxies with the highest extinctions ( @xmath126 ) have longer @xmath47  than the rest of the sample ( ks@xmath127 that the distributions are drawn from the same parent population ) , however since these galaxies also have larger than average @xmath2 , this may only be the reflection of the previously reported dependence of @xmath47  on @xmath2 .",
    "more interestingly , there is no sign for the least extincted galaxies to have shorter than average @xmath47 ; galaxies in the lowest quartile of @xmath128 have @xmath47  values consistent with the rest of the population ( ks@xmath26=0.56 )    additionally , as shown in figure [ lcosfr ] , the break in the @xmath129-sfr ( or @xmath130 ) relation occurs at @xmath1@xmath131@xmath4 , below the mass range of the cold gass sample . to extend the sample , in particular in the mass range of @xmath1@xmath104@xmath4 , which is not probed by cold gass , figure [ lcosfr ] also presents data from the literature compilation of @xcite , which includes co measurements from @xcite . as we further do not observe any dependence of the residuals of the @xmath47-@xmath1  relation on metallicity ( see fig .",
    "b1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we conclude that the cold gass galaxies , bar a few possible exceptions , are not in the regime where @xmath32  is affected by photodissociation of the co molecules due to reduced dust - shielding .    however , some of the galaxies in the sample are interacting , and it has been shown that in systems undergoing major mergers such as nearby ulirgs and high@xmath132 smgs , the value of @xmath32  is reduced by a factor of 5 @xcite . in  [ gasmass ]",
    "we have presented our favored strategy to assign a value of @xmath32  to each galaxy . in short , a galaxy is given either the galactic or the  ulirg \" @xmath32  based on a quantitative measure of the ism conditions , in this case the dust temperature as parametrized by the @xmath133 ratio .",
    "as a reference , the ks relation derived with this conversion factor choice and initially presented in figure [ ks ] is repeated in figure [ ksxco]b . in panel ( a ) of the same figure , we show the ks relation , had we assigned a galactic @xmath32  for all the galaxies . the main result of this study , namely that interacting / disturbed galaxies have shorter than average depletion times while bulge - dominated galaxies have the longest depletion times , is still visible .",
    "however , in this case the galaxies undergoing the most violent interactions ( and also having the highest ir luminosities and dust temperatures ) do no longer mark the upper envelope of the distribution . the second consequence of applying the galactic @xmath32  to the merging galaxies is that their gas fractions become very large ( @xmath134 ) , unrealistically so considering that normal star - forming galaxies in our sample have on average @xmath135 , and never more that @xmath136 .    in figure [ ksxco]c",
    ", we show the results of applying a prescription for @xmath32  that also depends on @xmath133 , but this time in a continuous manner rather than as a bimodal one @xcite .",
    "the results are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar ."
