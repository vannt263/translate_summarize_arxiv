    "colorings and color symmetries of crystals and quasicrystals can be considered a classical topic in crystallography ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of the literature on colorings of lattices or @xmath0-modules put emphasis on bravais colorings ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , studies have been made on general colorings of lattices or @xmath0-modules such as in @xcite . in this contribution , we give some results on how to identify the color groups of sublattice colorings of lattices or @xmath0-modules , and give examples to illustrate them . in particular , we give nonperfect non - bravais colorings of the rectangular lattice and the vertices of the ammann - beenker tiling .    by a _ @xmath0-module @xmath2 of rank @xmath3 and dimension @xmath4 _ , we mean a subset of @xmath5 that is spanned by @xmath3 vectors in @xmath5 that are linearly independent over @xmath0 but span @xmath5 . as a group ,",

    "a @xmath0-module @xmath6 of equal rank and dimension is called a _",

    "a _ coloring _ of @xmath7 by @xmath8 colors is an onto mapping @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the set of @xmath8 colors used in the coloring .",
    "of particular interest are colorings of @xmath7 by @xmath8 colors wherein two points of @xmath7 are assigned the same color if and only if they belong to the same coset of a sublattice @xmath11 of index @xmath8 in @xmath7 .",
    "such a coloring shall be referred to as a _ coloring of @xmath7 determined by its sublattice @xmath11_. here , the set of colors @xmath10 can be identified with the quotient group @xmath12 so that the color mapping @xmath13 is simply the canonical projection of @xmath7 onto @xmath12 with kernel @xmath11 .",
