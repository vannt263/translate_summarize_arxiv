    "in the standard cosmology , the universe is described by a space - time manifold @xmath0 endowed with a locally ( spatially ) homogeneous and isotropic metric @xmath1 \\,,\\ ] ] where , depending on the spatial curvature @xmath2 , the geometry of the @xmath3space @xmath4 is either euclidean ( @xmath5 ) , spherical ( @xmath6 ) , or hyperbolic ( @xmath7 ) . the spatial section @xmath4 is usually taken to be one of the simply - connected spaces : euclidean @xmath8 , spherical @xmath9 , or hyperbolic @xmath10 . however , given that the connectedness of the spatial sections @xmath4 has not been determined by cosmological observations , and since geometry does not fix the topology , our @xmath3dimensional space may be one of the possible multiply connected quotient manifolds of the form @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a fixed - point free group of isometries of the corresponding covering space .",
    "thus , for example , for the euclidean geometry ( @xmath5 ) besides @xmath15 there are 6 classes of topologically distinct compact orientable spaces @xmath4 .",
    "the immediate observational consequence of a detectable nontrivial topology@xcite of @xmath4 is the existence of the circles - in - the - sky,@xcite i.e. , pairs of matching circles will be imprinted on the cmbr anisotropy sky maps  @xcite .",
    "hence , to observationally probe a putative nontrivial topology of @xmath4 , one should examine the full - sky cmbr maps in order to extract the pairs of correlated circles and determine the spatial topology .    in the context of the 5d braneworld models",
    "the universe is described by a @xmath16-dimensional metrical orbifold ( bulk ) @xmath17 that is mirror symmetric ( @xmath18 ) across the 4d brane ( manifold ) @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the bulk can be decomposed as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a @xmath18 symmetric euclidean space , and where @xmath19 is endowed with a robertson  walker metric  ( [ rwmetric ] ) , which is recovered when @xmath22 for the extra non - compact spatial dimension . in this way ,",
    "the multiplicity of possible inequivalent topologies of our @xmath3dimensional space , and the physical consequences of a non - trivial detectable topology of @xmath4 as the circles - in - the - sky are brought on the braneworld scenario .",
    "here we briefly study the constraints that a detection of a spatial topology may place on the parameters of a simple braneworld modified - gravity model that accounts for the accelerated expansion of the universe via infrared modifications to general relativity , namely the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model@xcite , as generalized to cosmology by deffayet@xcite . to this end",
    "we reanalyze the type ia supernovae constraints on the parameters of the dgp model and show that pds topology gives rise to strong and complementary constraints on the parameters of the dgp model .",
    "using the first - year data the wmap team reported a total density value@xcite @xmath23 , while the three - year wmap article@xcite reports six different values for the @xmath24 ranging from a very nearly flat @xmath25 to positively curved @xmath26 depending on the combination of data set used to resolve the geometrical degeneracy .",
    "the poincar dodecahedral space ( pds ) , @xmath27 , explains both the suppression of power of the low multipoles and this observed total density .",
    "we note , however , that other topologies as @xmath28 also remain viable.@xcite attempts to find antipodal or nearly - antipodal circles - in - the - sky in the wmap data have failed  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , claim of hints of matching circles@xcite in ilc wmap maps , which a second group has confirmed@xcite but have also shown that the circle detection lies below the false positive threshold.@xcite . on the other hand , even if one embraces the result that pairs of antipodal ( or nearly antipodal ) circles of radius @xmath29 are undetectable in the current cmbr maps,@xcite the question arises as to whether the circles are not there or are merely hidden by various sources of contamination ( doppler , integrated sachs - wolfe , e.g. ) , or even due to the angular resolution of the current cmbr maps , as suggested in ref .  .",
    "the answer to these questions requires great care , among other things , because the level of contamination depends on both the choice of the cosmological models ( parameters ) and on the topology@xcite .",
    "results so far remain non - conclusive , i.e. , one group finds their negative outcome to be robust for globally homogeneous topologies , including the dodecahedral space , in spite of contamination@xcite , while another group finds the contamination strong enough to hide the possible correlated circles in the current cmbr maps.@xcite     a schematic illustration of two antipodal matching circles in the lss .",
    ", width=170,height=170 ]    in @xmath30 space the pairs of matching circles are necessarily antipodal as shown in fig .",
    "[ cinthesky1 ] .",
    "clearly the distance between the centers of each pair of the correlated circles is twice the injectivity radius of the smallest sphere inscribable @xmath30 . a straightforward use of trigonometric relations for the right - angled spherical triangle shown in fig .  [ cinthesky1 ]",
    "yields @xmath31 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the radius of the lss , @xmath33 is an integration variable , @xmath34 is the hubble parameter , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is a topological invariant ( equals to @xmath37 for @xmath30 ) , the distance @xmath38 is measured _ in units of the curvature radius _ , @xmath39 , and @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ chilss ] ) makes apparent that @xmath38 depends on the cosmological scenario . for the dgp model one has @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a length scale beyond which gravity starts to leak out into the bulk .",
    "equations  ( [ chilss ] ) and  ( [ dgp ] ) give the relation between the angular radius @xmath43 and the parameters of the dgp model , and thus can be used to set constraints on these parameters .    to illustrate the role of the cosmic topology in constraining the dgp parameter we consider the @xmath30 spatial topology , and assume the angular radius @xmath44 and uncertainty @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ dgp_p0 ] shows the results of our joint sne ia plus cosmic topology analysis , where the _ gold _ sample of 157 sne ia , as compiled by riess _",
    "et al._,@xcite was used . there",
    "we display the confidence regions in the parametric plane @xmath46@xmath47 and also the regions from the conventional analysis with no such a topology assumption .",
    "the comparison between these regions makes clear that the effect of the @xmath30 topology is to reduce considerably the area corresponding to the confidence intervals in the parametric plane as well as to break degeneracies arising from the current sne ia measurements .",
    "the best - fit parameters for this joint analysis are @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    for a detailed analysis of topological constraints in the context of the dgp and other models , including braneworld inspired models ,",
    "see refs .   and refs .",
    "finally , we note that in refs .",
    "constraints are placed on the dgp models using supernova and other data but with no such a topological constraint .",
