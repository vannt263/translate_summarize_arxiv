    "according to current observational results , a mysterious field , named dark energy , which accounts for @xmath3 of the cosmic composition , is governing the late time dynamics of the universe .",
    "however , although fundamental to our understanding of the universe , several important questions about the nature of this dark energy component and its role in the cosmic dynamics remain unanswered ( see , e.g. , @xcite for some recent reviews ) .    among many possible candidates ,",
    "perhaps the simplest explanation for current observations is that the unclumped form of energy density corresponds to a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 , whose presence modifies the einstein field equations to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the einstein tensor , @xmath6 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter fields and cdm particles , and @xmath7 is the einstein s constant ( throughout this paper we work in units where the speed of light @xmath8 ) .    from the observational point of view , it is well known that flat models with a very small cosmological term ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ) are in good agreement with almost all sets of cosmological observations , which makes them an excellent description of the observed universe . from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "however , at least two problems still remain .",
    "first , and possibly the most serious one is the unsettled situation in the particle physics / cosmology interface ( the so - called cosmological constant problem ( ccp )  @xcite ) , in which the cosmological upper bound differs from theoretical expectations ( @xmath11 @xmath10 ) by more than 100 orders of magnitude .",
    "the second is that , although a very small ( but non - zero ) value for @xmath0 could conceivably be explained by some unknown physical symmetry being broken by a small amount , one should be able to explain not only why it is so small but also why it is exactly the right value that is just beginning to dominate the energy density of the universe now . since both components ( dark matter and dark energy ) are usually assumed to be independent and , therefore , scale in different ways , this would require an unbelievable coincidence , the so - called coincidence problem ( cp ) .    a phenomenological attempt at alleviating the cp problem is allowing the dark matter and dark energy to interact ( in the case of a @xmath0-dark matter interaction",
    ", @xmath0 is necessarily a time - dependent quantity , which is the basic idea behind the decaying @xmath0 models whose aim is to solve or alleviate the ccp)-type term that varies in space or time should be thought of as a new time - varying field and not as a cosmological constant . here",
    ", however , we adopt the usual nomenclature of time - varying or dynamical @xmath0 models . ] .",
    "cosmological scenarios with a dynamical @xmath0 term were independently proposed about two decades ago in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) whereas models of couped quintessence ( in which the dark energy is represented by a scalar field @xmath12 or by a smooth component parameterized by an equation of state @xmath13 with @xmath14 ) have been investigated more recently  @xcite . in both cases , however , the absence of a natural guidance from fundamental physics on a possible interacting or coupling term between the two dark components leads most of the current investigations discussed in the literature to a phenomenological level .    in this regard , a still phenomenological but very interesting step toward a more realistic interacting or coupling law was recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the time dependence of the @xmath0 term is deduced from its effect on the cdm evolution .",
    "such a coupling is similar to the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from arguments based on renormalization group and seems to be very general , having many of the previous attempts as a particular case .",
    "thermodynamical considerations for this class of dynamical @xmath0 models  @xcite showed that the interacting parameter @xmath15 must be positive , which means that the energy transfer between @xmath0 and the dark matter field is such that the latter always gains energy from the former , and not the other way around . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a scalar field description for this class of dynamical @xmath0 models was investigated and found to be well represented by a coupled double exponential potential of the type @xmath16 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a coupled quintessence model based on the above arguments ( for which the equation - of - state parameter @xmath17 ) as well as some observational constraints on the interacting term were discussed .",
    "an important aspect worth emphasizing is that in the above analyses the interacting parameter @xmath15 has been considered constant over the cosmic evolution whereas in a more realistic case it must be a time - dependent quantity .",
    "our goal in this paper is therefore to go a step further in the above description and extend the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite to a physically more realistic case in which @xmath15 is a function of time .",
    "we restrict the present analysis to coupled quintessence models in which @xmath18 , which is mathematically equivalent to dynamical @xmath0 scenarios . in terms of the interacting function @xmath1",
    ", we discuss the dynamical behavior of this class of models and find viable cosmological solutions for a subset of values of @xmath1 .",
    "the possibility of transient accelerating solutions in which the universe will experience a future dark matter - dominated phase is also explored .",
    "we also carry out a joint statistical analysis with recent observations of sne ia , bao , cmb and @xmath2 to check the observational viability of this general class of interacting @xmath0-dark matter models .",
    "from eq .  ( [ efe ] ) the bianchi identities imply that the coupling between a dynamical @xmath0 term and cdm particles must be of the type and cdm particles . for a discussion about bounds on the interaction with conventional matter from local gravity experiments , see  @xcite . for constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis , see also  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath19 or , equivalently , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the energy densities of cdm and @xmath0 , respectively , and @xmath23 stands for the energy - momentum tensor of the cdm field .",
    "as usual , the dot sign denotes derivative with respect to the time .",
    "the @xmath0-cdm interaction implies that the energy density of this latter component must dilute at a different rate compared to its standard evolution , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "thus , the deviation from the standard dilution may be characterized by the function @xmath1 , such that @xmath26 where we have set the present - day value of the cosmological scale factor @xmath27 . since the other matter fields ( radiation and baryons )",
    "are separately conserved , eqs .",

    "although currently accelerated ( and , therefore , possibly in agreement with sne ia data ) , models with @xmath66 and negative values of @xmath39 ( figs . 1a and 2a )",
    "fail to reproduce the past dark matter - dominated epoch , whose existence is fundamental for the structure formation process to take place . in both cases ,",
    "the dark energy and dark matter densities vanish at high-@xmath67 and the universe is fully dominated by the baryons .",
    "note that the same is not true when both @xmath39 and @xmath38 take negative values ( fig .",
    "in this case , the negative signs compensate each other so that the dark matter dominates the past evolution of the universe while the baryonic and dark energy densities vanish .",
    "regardless of the sign of @xmath38 , well - behaved scenarios are obtained when @xmath39 takes positive values ( figs .",
    "1b and 2b ) .",
    "note that in these cases a mix of baryons ( @xmath68 ) and dark matter ( @xmath69 ) dominates the past evolution of the universe whereas the dark energy is always the dominant component from a value of @xmath70 on .",
    "a very interesting and completely different future cosmic evolution is obtained when @xmath66 and the parameter @xmath39 takes large positive values ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",

    "this kind of dynamic behavior is not found in most of the dynamical @xmath0 or coupled quintessence models discussed in the literature , being essentially a feature of the so - called thawing  @xcite and hybrid  @xcite potentials , which in turn seems to be in good agreement with some requirements of string or m theories , as discussed in ref .",

    "3 as a function of @xmath57 for some selected values of @xmath39 and @xmath38 . note that for large positive values of @xmath39 the universe was matter - dominated in the past [ @xmath78 for @xmath79 , switched to a long period of cosmic acceleration at @xmath80 but will eventually decelerate again at some @xmath81 ( see also @xcite for a discussion on quintessence and brane - world models of transient acceleration ) .    for the sake of completeness",

    "4 the effective equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter [ @xmath82 @xmath83 as a function of @xmath57 for some combinations of @xmath39 and @xmath38 . note that , while the value of @xmath39 determines the general behavior of @xmath84 , the interacting parameter @xmath38 is directly related to the duration of the accelerating phase .",
    "note also that , although presenting many different behaviors , clearly a very interesting one is provided by values of @xmath85 , in which @xmath84 behaves initially as freezing over all the past cosmic evolution , is approaching @xmath86 today ( in agreement with current observations ) , will become thawing in the near future and will behave as such over the entire future evolution of the universe .",
    "this freezing / thawing or hybrid behavior , originally discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is particularly interesting because , in principle , it could reconcile the slight preference of the sne ia and large scale structure data for freezing eos pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite ( which in turn leads to an eternally accelerating universe ) with the string / m - theory requirements discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "from now on we will discuss more quantitatively the observational viability of the class of interacting scenarios discussed above . to this end",
    "we perform a joint analysis involving current sne ia , bao , cmb and @xmath2 data .",
    "since we are particularly interested in bounds on the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 we fix @xmath61 from wmap results  @xcite ( which is also in good agreement with the bounds on the baryonic component derived from primordial nucleosynthesis  @xcite ) and consider the recent determination of the hubble parameter @xmath87",
    "@xcite in conjunction with the cmb constraint @xmath88  @xcite .",

    "the total compilation amounts to 414 sne ia events , which was reduced to 307 data points after selection cuts .",
    "we also use the distance ratio from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , as measured by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , @xmath91  @xcite . here",
    "this quantity is given by @xmath92^{1/3}r^{2/3}(z_{\\rm{bao}})}{r(z_{\\rm{ls}})}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the comoving distance .",
    "note that , although dark energy does not dominate early ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) , we do not use in our analysis either the bao ( @xmath94 ) or the cmb shift ( @xmath95 ) parameters since these quantities use the approximation that the sound travel distance is @xmath96 , which is not always true for interacting dark matter / energy models due to the process of energy transfer ( dark matter creation / annihilation  @xcite or varying mass particles  @xcite ) between these components ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "note also that the above quantity seems to be slightly more precise than the @xmath94 parameter since the scatter induced by uncertainties on @xmath97 cancels out in the ratio . in our analysis , therefore , we minimize the function @xmath98 , which takes into account both the sne ia and bao / cmb data discussed above ( we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for more on analyses involving different data sets ) .",
    "the results of our statistical analyses are displayed in fig .",
    "figure 5a shows confidence contours at 68.3% and 95.4% in the parametric space @xmath99 that arise from the joint analysis described above .",
    "as expected , we note that the current observational bounds on @xmath39 are quite weak since it appears as a power of the scale factor in the energy density [ eqs .",
    "( [ dm ] ) and ( [ decayv2 ] ) ] .",
    "note also that very large values of the interaction parameter @xmath38 are completely excluded regardless the value of @xmath39 , and that the same is also true for almost the entire interval of negative values of @xmath39 unless @xmath100 which , irrespective of the dimensionless parameter @xmath39 , behaves very similarly to the standard @xmath0cdm model .    to better visualize the constraints on @xmath38 , in fig .",
    "5b we plot the plane @xmath101 . from this analysis",
    "we find @xmath102 at 1@xmath103 level ( @xmath104 ) , which means that both negative and positive values for the interacting parameter are allowed .",
    "physically , this amounts to saying that not only is an energy flow from dark energy to dark matter ( @xmath66 ) observationally allowed , but so is a flow from dark matter to dark energy ( @xmath105 ) [ see eq . ( [ dm ] ) ] . if we take in account the thermodynamical constraint derived in ref .",

    "although physically more realistic and producing viable cosmic histories as shown in figs . 1 and 2 , clearly the introduction of a time - dependence on @xmath1 ( quantified by the parameter @xmath39 ) weakens the constraining power of the analysis . for the case",

    "we have discussed some cosmological consequences of an alternative mechanism of cosmic acceleration based on a general class of @xmath0-cdm interacting scenarios whose interaction term @xmath15 is deduced from the effect of the dark energy on the cdm expansion rate .",
    "we have gone a step further in the above description and extended the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite to a more realistic case in which @xmath15 is a function of time [ see eq .",

    "the resulting expressions for the model are parameterized by the dimensionless parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 and have many of the previous phenomenological approaches as a particular case .",
    "we have also investigated the dynamical behavior of these scenarios and found a number of viable cosmological solutions for a subset of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "in particular , for large positive values of @xmath39 ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath66 we have found solutions of transient acceleration , in which the @xmath0-dark matter interaction will drive the universe to a new matter - dominated era in the future . as mentioned earlier , this kind of solution seems to be in agreement with theoretical constraints from string / m theories on the quintessence potential @xmath112 or , equivalently , on the dark energy equation - of - state @xmath113 , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the observational point of view",
    ", we have investigated the current bounds on the parameterization ( [ parametrization_a ] ) from recent data of sne ia ( union sample ) , the distance ratio from baryon acoustic oscillation at @xmath89 and cmb decoupling at @xmath90 , and @xmath2 estimates .",
    "we have shown that negative and positive values for the interacting parameter @xmath38 are observationally allowed , which means that both an energy flow from dark energy to dark matter as well as a flow from dark matter to dark energy are possible .",
    "for the parameter @xmath39 we have also found that positive values are largely favoured over negative ones .",
    "this includes all the well - behaved cases shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that we have restricted the present analysis to coupled quintessence models in which @xmath18 ( dynamical @xmath0 models ) whereas a full treatment of the dark matter - dark energy interaction must also take into account the role of the dark energy equation - of - state in the process .",
    "some theoretical and observational consequences of a @xmath113-cdm interacting scenario with a time - dependent coupling term , as well as a scalar field description for this class of models will appear in a forthcoming communication  @xcite .",
