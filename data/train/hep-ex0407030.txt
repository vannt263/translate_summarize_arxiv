    "charmonium has played a crucial role in the recent history of particle physics .",
    "it has been nearly 30 years since its discovery in both @xmath20 interactions  @xcite and in collisions of protons on a beryllium target  @xcite . over the last two decades ,",
    "the charmonium and bottomonium systems have served as a laboratory for testing qcd . in the weak sector",
    ", charmonium also serves as a critical tool in extracting ckm  @xcite phases in @xmath21-meson decays .",
    "however , even after 30 years of studying @xmath22 systems , we still lack a complete understanding of their production mechanisms in glue - rich environments .    about a decade ago , the cdf experiment reported production rates of charmonium in proton - antiproton collisions which exceeded the existing theoretical calculations by a factor of about 10 for @xmath8 and about a factor of 50 for @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "an explanation of this excess was given by the so - called _ color - octet _",
    "mechanism  @xcite , whereby a gluon fragments into a color - octet @xmath23 @xmath24 pair , which then evolves non - perturbatively into a color - singlet by emission of a soft gluon .",
    "the size of this non - perturbative matrix element is not predicted and was determined by a fit to the cdf data . because of the glue - rich environment and the @xmath25 suppression of the color - singlet process relative to the color - octet process , it was argued  @xcite that the latter contribution is likely to be important . while this model can explain the rate and momentum spectrum of @xmath8 and @xmath15 production at the tevatron it appears that it does not properly describe recent @xmath8 polarization data from cdf  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when the same matrix elements determined at cdf are applied to photoproduction of @xmath8 at hera , the color - octet contribution is about a factor of ten too large  @xcite .    over the last several years",
    ", the role of the color - octet mechanism in @xmath8 production in @xmath26 collisions has been under theoretical study  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the color - octet processes are expected to give rise to significant differences in the @xmath8 momentum spectrum and production angle as compared to color - singlet production .",
    "recently , both babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite have reported measurements of the cross section and the momentum spectra of @xmath8 s in @xmath20 collisions on the @xmath27 ( @xmath21 decays excluded ) or just below the @xmath28 ( _ i.e. , _ in the continuum ) .",
    "@xmath29 ) pb , whereas belle measures a number which is 40% lower , ( 1.47@xmath60.10@xmath60.13 ) pb ( about 3 standard deviations below than the babar result ) .",
    "the two experiments both observe similar shapes for the @xmath8 momentum spectrum , which are softer than the predictions of the color - octet model  @xcite which predict a peaking of the @xmath8 momentum spectrum near the kinematic endpoint .",
    "however , recent theoretical studies of the color - octet subprocesses , @xmath30  @xcite and @xmath31  @xcite , show that the perturbative expansion breaks down near the kinematic endpoint , and the authors appeal to soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) to systematically include the non - perturbative effects . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that by using scet the color - octet model predictions can be sufficiently softened and reasonably good agreement with @xmath32 data can be achieved , although the calculation is not completely predictive because it uses a shape function which is fit to the @xmath32 data  @xcite .",
    "belle also reports on production of @xmath15 in @xmath20 collisions , with a measured ratio @xmath33 .",
    "that is , the production rates for @xmath8 and @xmath15 in @xmath20 collisions are approximately equal .",
    "the color - singlet mechanism can yield the @xmath15 final state , but the expected ratio is @xmath3410%  @xcite .",
    "belle has extended their inclusive @xmath8 analysis to search for associated charmed particles , and they find : @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the color - octet contribution is expected to be at the level of 1%  @xcite of the inclusive rate .",
    "the disagreement here indicates that the production mechanisms of charmonium are not well understood , and more theoretical and experimental input is required .",
    "several theoretical papers  @xcite have suggested that the study of @xmath8 production in @xmath0 decays could provide an alternate probe of the charmonium system in that the @xmath0 decay provides a glue - rich environment in which @xmath8 mesons can be produced abundantly through the color - octet mechanism .",
    "the kinematics of such @xmath8 s are expected to exhibit signatures distinct from other production mechanisms , such as a peak in the @xmath8 momentum spectrum near the kinematic endpoint .",
    "the predicted branching fraction from color - octet processes is @xmath36  @xcite , with approximately 10% feed - down expected from @xmath15 and another 10% from @xmath37  @xcite ( summed over all @xmath38 ) .",
    "color - singlet processes , such as @xmath39 start at @xmath40 , and are therefore suppressed relative to color - octet processes which enter at @xmath41 . however , computations of the color - singlet process @xmath42  @xcite indicate a sizeable branching fraction of @xmath43 , with about 10% coming from @xmath15 feed - down . the enhancement here arises because the non - perturbative color - singlet matrix element for @xmath44 may be 210 - 360 times larger than the corresponding color - octet matrix element , which is enough to compensate for the perturbative suppression .",
    "moreover , unlike the color - octet processes , this process inherently results in a soft @xmath8 momentum spectrum because of the two additional charm quarks in the final state . as a result",
    ", the @xmath8 momentum can not exceed about 3.3 gev/@xmath45 in this process .",
    "therefore , while the color - octet and color - singlet processes give similar predictions for total rate , their momentum distributions are significantly different . figure  [ jpsi_feyn2 ] shows feynman diagrams for ( a ) two of the more important color - octet processes and",
    "( b ) the @xmath42 color - singlet diagram .",
    "it should be noted that color - singlet production would also be signalled by the presence of additional charmed particles ( open charm ) in association with the @xmath8 . to capitalize on the small yield of @xmath8 s in @xmath0 decay , many @xmath46 decay channels , both inclusive and exclusive",
    "will need to be explored .",
    "we therefore relegate the search for open charm in association with @xmath8 in @xmath0 decay to a future report .",

    "is produced in a color - octet and becomes a color - singlet through emission of a soft gluon.,width=480 ]    the process @xmath47 has been previously observed by cleo  @xcite , where the branching fraction was measured to be ( 1.1@xmath60.4@xmath60.2)@xmath48 based on @xmath4920 observed events .",
    "cleo also reported a soft momentum spectrum for the @xmath8 , albeit with limited statistical precision .",
    "the argus collaboration reported an upper limit of 0.68@xmath48  @xcite at 90% confidence level .",
    "the cleo collaboration has collected large data samples on the @xmath50(n@xmath51 ) resonances and currently has the world s largest samples of @xmath0 , @xmath50(2@xmath51 ) and @xmath50(3@xmath51 ) decays .",
    "consequently , cleo is in a unique position to help clarify the roles of color - singlet and color - octet models in @xmath8 production .    in this paper",
    ", we present vastly improved measurements of the rate , momentum spectrum , and angular distributions in @xmath47 decays .",
    "we also present first observations of the decays @xmath9 and evidence for @xmath52 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : evsel ] we discuss the data samples used , the @xmath8 backgrounds , event selection and @xmath8 reconstruction .",
    "section  [ sec : upstojpsix ] details the measurement of the @xmath47 branching fraction and momentum spectrum in @xmath0 decays .",
    "this section also includes a measurement of the cross section @xmath53 using data on and below the @xmath28 resonance , which is used to estimate and subtract the continuum contribution at the @xmath0 .",
    "the section concludes with an examination of some event - level distributions .",
    "section  [ sec : psitwos ] presents the measurement of the @xmath9 branching fraction .",
    "the report then discusses in section  [ sec : upstochicx ] the measurement @xmath54 . for each of these analyses ,",
    "we present a cross - check by measuring the corresponding branching fraction in @xmath21-meson decay .",
    "lastly , we discuss in section  [ sec : sys ] the systematic uncertainties in each of these analyses , and the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the analysis presented here uses data collected using the cleo iii detector  @xcite .",
    "the primary data sample includes 1.2 @xmath55 of data collected on the @xmath0 , and amounts to ( 21.2@xmath60.2)@xmath56 @xmath0 decays . for background determinations and systematic checks ,",
    "we also utilize 5.0 @xmath55 of data on the @xmath28 resonance ( 10.4 million @xmath21-meson decays ) and 2.3 @xmath55 just below ( @xmath4910.56 gev ) the @xmath28 resonance .",
    "we also use the on-@xmath28 data for cross - checks on charmonium yields in @xmath21-meson decays .",
    "the backgrounds to @xmath57 on the @xmath0 are : ( a ) radiative bhabha events , ( b ) @xmath58 fusion producing @xmath37 which subsequently produces @xmath59 , ( c ) radiative return processes such as @xmath60 or @xmath61 , and ( d ) continuum production ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "various event selection requirements are targeted at reducing or eliminating these backgrounds .",
    "radiative bhabha events produce background in the @xmath8 mass region when one of the hard leptons is combined with a soft lepton from the converted photon .",
    "such events are suppressed by requiring that the invariant mass of either electron from the @xmath4 candidate with any other electron in the event have @xmath62 mev/@xmath63 .",
    "events produced through @xmath64 fusion typically only leave two charged tracks in the cleo iii detector , and these events are therefore easily rejected by a requirement of at least 3 charged tracks .",
    "the radiative return backgrounds are suppressed through event selection criteria which take advantage of the special kinematics of these processes , namely a low particle multiplicity coupled with either the detection of a high energy photon ( @xmath494 gev ) or large missing event momentum .",
    "events are required to have their missing event momentum magnitude , @xmath65 gev/@xmath45 , or , if the number of charged tracks , @xmath66 , we require @xmath67 gev/@xmath45 . when the high energy photon is detected ( or an @xmath20 pair with invariant mass less than 100 mev/@xmath63 ) , the event is vetoed if @xmath66 and the ( converted ) photon has energy greater than 3.75 gev .",
    "the remaining background from these three sources to the @xmath47 signal is negligible .",
    "however , because of the small signal in @xmath9 , the remaining background can not be neglected . this background is determined using the evtgen mc followed by a geant - based detector simulation , and the resulting contribution is subtracted from the observed yields .",
    "continuum background is reduced by requiring that the second fox - wolfram moment  @xcite , @xmath68 .",
    "the remainder of this background is estimated using @xmath28 data , and is statistically subtracted from the observed @xmath0 yields .",
    "the estimate of this background is discussed in sections  [ sec : bkest ] and  [ sec : bkexp ] .",
    "candidate @xmath8 s are formed by pairing oppositely charged electron or muon candidates .",
    "these charged track candidates are required to have momentum in the range from 0.1 to 5.3 gev/@xmath45 and have at least 50% of the maximum number of expected hits in the tracking system .",
    "we also require these tracks to be consistent with coming from the interaction point in three dimensions .",
    "electron candidates are additionally required to have a shower profile which is consistent with expectations for an electron and an energy deposition in the calorimeter , @xmath69 , which is compatible with its measured momentum , @xmath70 , by requiring @xmath71 . for these electron candidates ,",
    "we correct for radiated photons by adding back the momentum of the highest energy photon which lies within a 5@xmath72 cone of the initial particle direction .",
