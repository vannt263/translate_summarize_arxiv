    "the classification of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) depends upon the wavelength at which one observes .",
    "historically , optical observations yielded the categories of seyfert types 1 and 2 , classifying most of the sources which are now `` famous '' .",
    "seyfert-2 galaxies differ from type-1 in that the former show only narrow emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "it was soon realized that some seyferts showed weak broad components along with the narrow emission lines and consequently the subclasses seyfert-1.5 , 1.8 and 1.9 were introduced to quantify the differences in strength of the broad - line components relative to the narrow lines .",
    "narrow emission line galaxies ( nelgs ) are bright and variable x - ray sources , discovered in early x - ray sky surveys ( marshall   1979 ) .",
    "the narrow optical emission lines often have weak , broad h@xmath0 and p@xmath1 emission ( ward  1978 , veron  1980 , shuder , 1980 ) making the optical spectra similar to seyfert-1.9 galaxies .",
    "thus the nelg classification is indicative that the source was discovered in an x - ray survey , but many nelgs are otherwise indistinguishable from seyfert-1.9 galaxies .",
    "optical spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry , infrared spectroscopy , x - ray spectroscopy and temporal studies plus @xmath2-ray spectra are all important in the determination of the fundamental nature of obscured nuclei .",
    "unification models for agn postulate that large amounts of dense , molecular material exists between the broad - emission - line region ( blr ) and the narrow - emission - line region ( nlr ) , in some cases within parsecs of the active nucleus ( see antonucci 1993 for a review of unified models for agn ) .",
    "the simplest geometry consistent with observations is a torus , and consequently it has been suggested that one of the primary factors in seyfert classification is the orientation of the absorbing torus to our line - of - sight .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with the existence of circumnuclear molecular gas suggested by absorption measurements in a number of wavebands ( e.g. braatz  1993 , greenhill 1996 ) .",
    "in unified models , sources observed within the opening angle of the torus correspond to those classified optically as type-1 agn , while sources with lines - of - sight intersecting the torus correspond to type-2 agn . in the latter case ,",
    "the nuclear light can nevertheless be observed via scattering or transmission .",
    "antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) provided compelling support for this model when they detected broad , seyfert-1 type emission lines in the polarized optical spectrum of the seyfert-2 galaxy ngc 1068 , and similar results were later obtained for a number of seyfert-2 galaxies ( miller and goodrich 1990 ; tran , miller and kay 1992 ) .",
    "recently , veilleux  ( 1997 ) provided further support for the model with their infrared observations of pa@xmath1 , br@xmath2 and br@xmath0 lines in many seyfert 2 galaxies , revealing hidden blrs which were not always detectable in scattered optical light .",
    "optically - thick torii would be expected to result in collimation of nuclear continuum radiation , and imaging of optical emission lines has shown preferential elongation of some narrow - line regions along the radio axis of the agn ( haniff , wilson & ward 1988 ) .",
    "these regions must be ionized by a more intense radiation field than is directly observed , again , supporting the unified model ( e.g. pogge 1988 , tadhunter and tsvetanov 1989 ) .",
    "further support came from  x - ray spectra , which showed large absorbing columns and iron k@xmath0 lines of high equivalent width ( ew ) ( e.g. awaki  1991 ) .",
    "the _ asca _ satellite ( makishima et al . 1996 ) consists of four co - aligned grazing - incidence x - ray telescopes ( xrts ; serlemitsos et al .",
    "the focal - plane instruments are two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( siss ) , each consisting of four ccd chips , providing an effective bandpass @xmath30.410  kev ( burke et al .",
    "1994 ) , and two gas imaging spectrometers ( giss ) at the focus of the other two xrts , providing coverage over @xmath30.810  kev ( ohashi et al . 1996 and",
    "references therein ) .",
    "the sources presented here were systematically analyzed in the same way as the broad - line seyfert galaxies presented in nandra  1997 ( hereafter n97 ) .",
    "the analysis method is also described in paper  i.    in a previous paper we presented the basic data - analysis results from a sample of _ asca _ observations of type-2 seyfert galaxies ( turner  1997a , hereafter paper i ) , i.e. those having predominantly narrow optical emission lines . the original sample of 26 observations of 25 narrow - line agn comprised 17 seyfert-2 galaxies and 8 nelgs drawn from the _ asca _ public archive . in paper",
    "i we found the 0.6 - 10 kev  spectra of a sample of seyfert-2 galaxies and nelgs to be complex , often containing a heavily - absorbed continuum component , a soft x - ray component and numerous x - ray emission lines .",
    "we found the 6 - 7 kev regime to be dominated by line flux from gas with ionization - state @xmath4 fe xvi .",
    "several sites are expected to produce significant x - ray line emission in agn including the line - of - sight absorber , optically - thick material out of the line - of - sight ( both the putative accretion disk and other larger - scale systems such as the torus ) , ionized ( scattering ) gas and regions of starburst emission .",
    "the absence of a strong 6.4 kev iron line component in starburst galaxies ( ptak  1997 ) , indicates that the presence of such a line is likely to be an indication of nuclear activity .",
    "iron k@xmath0 yields the strongest observed x - ray emission line in seyfert galaxies , and thus provides an important probe of conditions in the reprocessing material . a discussion of sources dominated by scattered and compton - reflected x - rays was presented in a second paper ( turner  1997b , hereafter paper ii ) .    fig .",
    "1 ( repeated from paper  ii , for ease of reference ) shows the equivalent width of the iron k - shell line plotted against neutral x - ray absorbing column , @xmath5 , for the sample sources .",
    "equivalent widths were measured against the continuum component dominating the 6 - 8 kev range , and based upon the fit to a narrow gaussian profile ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "the dot - dashed line in fig  1 denotes the equivalent width of iron k@xmath0 predicted to be produced by transmission through a uniform shell of neutral material ( with solar abundances subtending 4@xmath6 to a continuum source of photon index @xmath7 , leahy & creighton 1993 ) , where the photon flux @xmath8 .",
    "the dashed line shows the equivalent width predicted via compton - reflection from optically - thick material , as a function of , assuming that only the power - law is absorbed . in this case",
    "the reflection is assumed to be produced from the accretion disk with an equivalent width @xmath9 ev ( n97 ) , as typically observed in seyfert-1 galaxies .",
    "coincidently , 230 ev represents both the maximum equivalent width observed when iron k@xmath0 was parameterized as a narrow gaussian line , and the mean equivalent width assuming a relativistic line profile ( n97 ) .",
    "sources can lie significantly above both of these model lines if the direct continuum is hidden but the reprocessed emission is observed , as the line equivalent width is then measured against a suppressed continuum .",
    "consideration of the iron k@xmath0 , ` [ ` oiii ` ] ` @xmath10 line and x - ray variability together suggested that ngc  1068 , ngc  4945 , ngc  2992 , mrk  3 , mrk  463e and mrk  273 are dominated by reprocessed x - rays ( paper  ii ) .",
    "these sources were denoted `` group c '' ( marked with squares on fig .  1 ) .",
    "sources lying on the `` leahy and creighton line '' were denoted `` group a '' ( marked as circles on fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus group a is composed of ngc  1808 , ngc  4507 , ngc  5252 , ngc  6240 , eso  103-g35 , ic  5063 , ngc  7172 and ngc  7582 .",
    "( table  1 shows the group designation of the sources based upon the original sample ) .",
    "sources with iron k@xmath0 equivalent widths lying between that line and the 230 ev line are consistent with seyfert-1 spectra transmitted through a high absorbing column and are denoted `` group b '' ( marked as stars on fig .  1 ) .",
    "group b is composed of ngc  526a , ngc  2110 , mcg-5 - 23 - 16 and ngc  7314 , which are all nelgs .",
    "this classification implies we see the nuclear component directly in group b , and this is supported by the observation of rapid x - ray variability in their flux ( paper  i and hayashi  1996 ) and rapid variability of the iron line profile in ngc  7314 ( yaqoob  1996 ) .",
    "this division into groups a , b and c leaves mcg-01 - 01 - 043 , ngc  4968 , ngc  6251 , e  0449 , ngc  5135 and ngc  1667 unclassified , i.e. those with the lowest signal - to - noise ratio in the  data .",
    "as we will demonstrate , this crude classification of sources yields a useful insight into the relative importance of the regions contributing to the x - ray spectra in several different cases .",
    "the distribution of sample sources is shown in table  2 .    to summarize , in paper  ii we showed that in group - c sources the iron k@xmath0 complex contains significant contributions from neutral and high - ionization species of iron , thus compton - reflection , hot gas and starburst emission all could make significant contributions to the observed x - ray spectra .",
    "mrk  3 appeared to be the only source which had little contamination by starburst activity and in this case the _ asca _ spectrum below 3 kev is dominated by gas with an x - ray ionization parameter @xmath11 ( as defined by netzer 1996 ) and effective column density @xmath12 .",
    "this material is more highly ionized than the zone of material comprising the warm absorber seen in seyfert-1 galaxies ( george  1997 , hereafter g97 ) , but may contain a contribution from shock - heated gas associated with the jet .    in this paper the x - ray properties of sources in groups",
    "a and b are examined in the context of unified models for agn .",
    "paper  i suggested the underlying continuum has a power - law with a slope @xmath13 in the 0.6  10 kev band .",
    "however , this result might not be meaningful for sources where we used a power - law to parameterize a spectrum dominated by scattered or reflected components ( i.e. group c ) .",
    "taking groups a and b and considering the continuum component which dominates the 2 - 10 kev band we obtained weighted mean slopes @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , and a dispersion of 0.11 for group a , 0.31 for group b.    it is difficult to make a strict comparison between our results and the indices derived for seyfert-1 galaxies .",
    "a slope @xmath16 was obtained when the latter where fit to a model which included the effects of compton - reflection ( e.g. g97 ) .",
    "type-2 seyferts generally have complex soft x - ray spectra , and it is difficult to constrain the soft component , primary power - law and the effects of compton reflection , using  data .",
    "however , we can compare the power - law parameterization of the 2 - 10 kev data with a similar parameterization of type-1 seyferts .",
    "group a slopes are consistent with the @xmath17 slopes obtained when proportional - counter spectra of seyfert-1 galaxies were modelled with a simple absorbed power - law ( mushotzky 1984 , turner & pounds 1989 ) over the @xmath18 kev range .",
    "thus group a appear consistent with the spectra of seyfert-1 galaxies when a comparison is made between similar fits .    in group b , ngc  526a and ngc  7314 show a flattening of the   spectra to high energies ( e.g. table  12 of paper  i ) while the indices inferred for the primary continuum are @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "mcg-5 - 23 - 16 and ngc  2110 appear to be dominated by @xmath21 and 1.6 components .",
    "the @xmath22 slope is the only one which lies outside of the range of slopes observed in the seyfert-1 sample ( g97 ) .",
    "however , the slope implied in the case of ngc  7314 depends strongly upon whether a hard component is allowed .",
    "we conclude that groups a and b both show spectra which are generally consistent with the distribution of primary continuum slopes observed in seyfert-1 galaxies . comparing historical x - ray observations of various sources",
    ", it seems that some sources show significant index variability , as noted by weaver  ( 1997 ) for mcg-5 - 23 - 16 .      as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "most of the sources in the original sample ( of 26 observations ) show a significant iron k@xmath0 line and the mean rest - energy of the line is @xmath23 kev ( paper  i ) .",
    "the equivalent widths from the narrow gaussian model are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "consideration of the ( weighted mean ) equivalent widths in the narrow gaussian model to the line yields @xmath24 and @xmath25 ev for groups a and b respectively .",
    "however , the narrow gaussian model ( with energy fixed at 6.4 kev ) could miss some of the flux from a broadened line .",
    "the broad gaussian model yields ews @xmath26 ev and @xmath27 ev for a and b. the line energies and widths are @xmath28 kev , @xmath29 kev , @xmath30 kev , @xmath31 kev .",
    "to investigate further , we constructed average profiles for each group .",
    "papers  i and ii showed the average sis+gis iron k@xmath0 line profiles for the individual sources .",
    "however , the sis data have superior energy resolution to the gis data , and so examination of the averaged sis0+sis1 data can give the clearest insight into the intrinsic line profiles .",
    "obviously , consideration of the sis data alone results in a decrease of signal - to - noise ratio when the data are considered on a source - by - source basis .",
    "however , the sis data can provide the most useful information when the data / model ratios for different sources are co - added .",
    "the energy - scale of each sis spectrum was redshift - corrected to the rest - frame of the source .",
    "the average sis data / model ratio was then calculated ( based upon the best - fit continuum model ) combining sources within each group .",
    "the result of this summation is shown for each group in fig .",
    "the dotted gaussian profile represents the sis instrument response for a narrow line observed at a rest - energy of 6.4 kev .",
    "the profile constructed from the seyfert-1 sample ( n97 ) is also shown for comparison .",
    "the group c profile shows line flux at and above 6.4 kev ( a result which is confirmed by consideration of the fits to the sis@xmath32gis data for each individual source ) probably due to the presence of unresolved iron k@xmath0 lines from a range of ionization - states ( as discussed in paper  ii ) .",
    "interestingly , the group c profile also shows a red wing . while this is small compared to the peak of this line , it is of the same amplitude ( @xmath33 ) as that observed in seyfert-1 galaxies , and group a and b. we return to this point later .",
    "the group b profile is not significantly distinguishable from that observed for seyfert-1 galaxies ( n97 ) .",
    "the line peak falls at @xmath34 kev , and the line core is significantly broadened towards lower energies .",
    "a very broad wing is also evident , with the broad line component peaking at @xmath35 kev , with width @xmath36 kev .",
    "a broad iron line with a red - wing is predicted if the line arises close to the black - hole and is subject to gravitational redshift .",
    "the iron k@xmath0 emission observed in seyfert-1 galaxies has been successfully modeled with profiles expected for a line originating in an accretion disk around a black - hole ( e.g. tanaka  1995 , n97 ) , hereafter denoted a disk - line . unless the disk is observed face - on , kinematic ( doppler ) effects cause the blue flux of the line to be enhanced relative to the red - wing , contrary to what is observed .",
    "hence the requirement for a face - on geometry when the red wing is the dominant feature observed . in the seyfert-1 case ,",
    "the iron k@xmath0 line profile was interpreted as originating in a relativistic accretion disk inclined close to face - on ( the mean inclination of the seyfert-1 sample was @xmath37 , for a fit where the emissivity was fixed as a function of radius ; n97 , table  5 ) .",
    "the similarity in line profiles suggests a comparable orientation for the inner regions of group b sources , which are all nelgs .",
    "the group a profile has a core which is consistent with a narrow gaussian line , centered at 6.4 kev .",
    "the equivalent width of the core is @xmath24 ev which could be produced by transmission of the power - law continuum through columns of @xmath38 in the line - of - sight ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "however , this profile also has excess flux in the wings of the line , reminiscent of the red - wing observed in group b and in seyfert-1 galaxies . in the light of the group b",
    "result , we removed the nelgs from the group a profile ( half the group ) .",
    "we found that the seyfert-2 galaxies alone also yield a similar profile with a broad red wing .",
    "our finding that group a and b have similar profiles is an interesting and surprising result as unification models predict the inner regions of type-2 seyferts to be observed edge - on .",
    "we attempted to fit the iron k@xmath0 line in individual sources , using the disk - line model profile of fabian  ( 1989 ) .",
    "that model assumes a schwarzschild geometry and computes the line profile but not the line strength . in that model",
    "the line emissivity is parameterized by a power - law as a function of radius , @xmath39 . as line and continuum parameters",
    "can be correlated , and as the fit depends significantly on the assumptions made , we adopted the same assumptions as those used to fit a large sample of seyfert-1 galaxies ( n97 ) , to allow a meaningful comparison between the two sets of results .",
    "in each case we assumed the line originates from a region between 6 and 1000 r@xmath40 , where the gravitational radius , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "the line emissivity function was assumed to be r@xmath43 .",
    "we allow the inclination of the disk relative to the observer to be a free parameter ( defined such that @xmath44 is a face - on disk ) , along with the normalization of the line .",
    "we assume the line energy @xmath45 kev in the rest - frame of the host galaxy .",
    "the disk - line fits were performed assuming the best continuum models from paper  i with all continuum parameters allowed to be free .",
    "the continuum models in paper  i were derived fitting the 0.6 - 5.0 plus 7 - 10 kev data , before consideration of the iron k regime was included in the model .",
    "in each case we also considered the results when an additional ( narrow ) line component was allowed , to represent the iron line produced in the line - of - sight absorber .",
    "the seyfert-2 galaxies in group a did not generally yield useful constraints on the inclination of any accretion disk system .",
    "this is due to the low signal - to - noise ratio in those sources , and the allowance of a relatively strong narrow - line component in the fits ( up to several hundred ev , which could be produced in the line - of - sight absorber ) .",
    "however , fitting a disk - line profile to the bright sources from group b yielded some interesting results .",
    "the rest energy of the narrow line component was fixed at 6.4 kev , and the equivalent width was constrained to be between 10  50 ev .",
    "this range embraces the values expected from the leahy & creighton ( 1993 ) simulations , but allows a wide range about the predicted value , to account for differences in spectrum for each source , and possible geometric effects .",
    "errors quoted are 1 @xmath46 .      _ ngc  526a _    the preferred continuum model for ngc  526a is a double power - law with @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( paper  i ) , flattening to @xmath49 . adding a disk - line profile to the model yields an improvement @xmath50 over the fit to a narrow gaussian line , with an inclination angle @xmath51 and ew@xmath52 ev . if one assumes instead a single power - law continuum partially - covered by the absorber , the fit yields the same inclination and consistent ew@xmath53 ev for the line .",
    "addition of a narrow gaussian component ( ew @xmath54 ev ) did not significantly improve the fit .    _ ngc  2110 _    the best - fit continuum from paper  i was a @xmath55 continuum partially - covered by ionized gas with @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the disk - line yielded an inclination angle @xmath58 , with ew@xmath59 ev and an improvement @xmath60 over the fit where the iron k@xmath0 line was modelled with a narrow gaussian component .",
    "addition of a narrow gaussian component ( @xmath61 ev ) did not significantly affect this fit .    _",
    "mcg-5 - 23 - 16 _    the nominal best - fit from paper  i was @xmath62 , @xmath63 , steepening to @xmath64 at @xmath65 kev . a disk - line fit to mcg-5 - 23 - 16 yielded a reduction @xmath66 ( f=60 ) compared to the fit where the 5 - 7 kev band is modelled with a series of narrow lines ( paper  i ; table  15 ) .",
    "the line ew was @xmath67 ev and the disk inclination was @xmath68 .",
    "addition of a narrow gaussian component ( @xmath61 ev ) did not significantly affect this fit .",
    "weaver  ( 1997 ) found a somewhat higher inclination angle in their analysis of mcg-5 - 23 - 16 , but all disk - line results depend strongly on the assumptions made in the fit , which were different in this analysis versus weaver  ( 1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath69 solution is consistent with the observation of some line flux blueward of the peak ( in addition to the red wing ) .",
    "_ ngc  7314 _    the nominal best - fit to ngc  7314 was @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the addition of a disk - line component yields a good description of the iron k@xmath0 line profile improving the fit by @xmath73 , compared to the narrow gaussian parameterization .",
    "the fit yields @xmath74 , @xmath75 ev .",
    "addition of a narrow gaussian component ( @xmath54 ev ) did not significantly affect this result .",
    "however , fits to this source are very sensitive to the underlying continuum and absorption . fitting the disk - line on top of a single power - law continuum , partially covered by a column @xmath76 produces a solution with @xmath77 , @xmath78 ev .",
    "the addition of a narrow gaussian component does not significantly affect this solution .",
    "the former fit is nominally statistically preferred ( by @xmath79 ) but obviously the conclusions drawn depend strongly on the approach taken in the spectral fitting , this is the origin of differences in the results obtained here versus yaqoob  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we now consider possible explanations for the ubiquity of the red wing on the iron k@xmath0 profiles of seyfert galaxies .    given the correlation between line and continuum parameters , an inadequate modelling of the continuum and absorption properties might be misleading us about the profile of the iron k@xmath0 line .",
    "this is more likely to produce a significant effect in type-2 seyferts than in type-1 , since the former show relatively large spectral modification due to attenuation in the middle of the  bandpass .",
    "however , it would be a strange coincidence for such a problem to so closely mimic the profile observed in seyfert-1 galaxies .",
    "consequently we consider this possibility unlikely to be the cause of the similarity in observed profiles .",
    "another possibility is that the type-2 objects have another mechanism for producing a red - wing on the iron k@xmath0 line .",
    "the existence of a compton - shoulder has been suggested for sources such as ngc  1068 ( iwasawa  1997 ) .",
    "however , the compton shoulder can not easily produce a such a strong wing extending down to such low energies as observed in our profiles .    despite the systematic effects observed , we note some variety in the profiles of individual sources in the seyfert type-1 and type-2 samples .",
    "we also note that the dark earth and coma cluster do not show these characteristic line profiles in their  spectra ( n97 ) .",
    "these facts suggest that the observed profiles are not an artifact of any outstanding uncertainties with the  calibration .",
    "we also consider the possibility that the iron k@xmath0 profile is not a good indicator of the orientation of the inner regions of the agn .",
    "if strong relativistic effects bend the light produced close to the central nucleus , then the iron k@xmath0 profiles could be distorted , and our fits to a schwarzchild profile could be misleading as to the orientation of the central source",
    ". in particular , the kerr metric allows contributions to line emission from a disk extending inwards to within a few gravitational radii , hence yielding more severely skewed line profiles than produced around a non - rotating black hole ( e.g. laor 1991 ) .",
    "however , these line profiles also have a distinct dependance on inclination angle , and as the line profiles of the type-1 and type-2 seyferts are so similar , the preferred orientation of the innermost reprocessor must be the same . in the discussion",
    "we investigate the consequences of this conclusion in the context of the unified model .",
    "observations at different wavelengths provide probes to different depths into the agn . assuming the circumnuclear absorbing material has a galactic dust - to - gas ratio , then a v band extinction of a@xmath801  mag",
    ". corresponds to a column of neutral hydrogen @xmath81 .",
    "an extinction a@xmath82 allows the broad line region to be observed .",
    "a@xmath83 5 - 8 hides the broad optical lines , still these agn can be identified by direct observation of the paschen series of lines in the infrared regime .",
    "extinction in excess of a@xmath84 still allow observations of pa@xmath1 ( which probe material up to a@xmath85 ) , br@xmath2 ( up to a@xmath86 ) and br@xmath0 ( up to a@xmath87 ; see vielleux  1997 ) .",
    "when the extinction approaches a@xmath88 then only x - ray and @xmath2-ray observations are able to provide a _",
    "direct _ view of the nucleus , and as extinction increases beyond this level , then even the 10 kev photons are hidden , the material is optically - thick to compton scattering and the central source is only detectable via scattering by material out of the line - of - sight .",
    "thus the classification assigned to a source may depend on the wavelength at which it is observed .",
    "observations in some bandpasses might not show any signature of an important component of the system .",
    "this has lead to some historical confusion as to the nature of some sources .      as evident in fig .  1 ,",
    "the column densities for group b sources are clustered around @xmath89 while group a span @xmath90 .",
    "as discussed in paper  ii , the column densities derived for the scattered x - ray sources ( group c ) generally do not represent the line - of - sight absorption to the nucleus .",
    "group  c sources were treated in detail in paper  ii and that class is not discussed further in this paper .    of the sources considered in this paper ,",
    "only ngc  7172 is consistent with a single power - law absorbed by neutral material .",
    "the spectra of all the other sources in groups a and b show a strong soft x - ray flux in excess of that predicted by extrapolation of the hard x - ray power - law , absorbed by neutral material .",
    "a `` soft excess '' can arise when there are unattenuated lines - of - sight to the nucleus , when the absorber is ionized or when a soft emission component is present .    of the group  a sources ;",
    "ngc  1808 , ngc  4507 , ngc  6240 , eso",
    "103-g35 and ngc  7582 have an intrinsic 0.5  2.0 kev luminosity in the soft component ( alone ) @xmath91 , when a correction is made only for the galactic line - of - sight column .",
    "( we note this yields a lower 0.5  2.0 kev luminosity than those listed in tables 8 - 13 of paper  i , which were corrected for total absorption . )",
    "consideration of the maximum starburst contribution to the x - ray flux ( paper  i ) reveals that only ngc  1808 is consistent with all of that soft flux originating from starburst regions ( tacconi - garman , sternberg & eckart 1996 ) , however , soft x - ray luminosities @xmath91 could be accounted for by the summed contributions of starburst emission , hot gas and binary stars in the host galaxy ( although these can not generally account for the observed hard x - ray luminosities ) .",
    "no significant variability is evident in the soft flux or absorbing column in ngc  4507 , ngc  1808 or ngc  6240 ( for which few x - ray observations are available ) , consistent with an active nucleus covered by a uniform absorber with an extended soft x - ray emission component providing the spectral complexity .",
    "variations in x - ray absorption have been claimed for eso  103-g35 ( warwick  1988 ) on the basis of two  observations which revealed a drop in column @xmath92 in 90 days .",
    "the timescale for variability indicated that absorber to be consistent with clouds at a radius coincident with the blr .",
    "the  observation reveals an absorbing column consistent with the most heavily absorbed  spectrum , as does analysis of a later  observation ( 26 september 1995 ) , raising the question as to whether a contaminating source could have affected the apparent measurement of a lower column at one of the  epochs .",
    "the absorption of ngc  7582 also appears lower ( @xmath93 ) than that observed during the  observation ( turner & pounds 1989 ) .",
    "the nearby bl lac pks2316 - 423 , may have contaminated the   spectrum obtained with the collimated medium energy ( me ) instrument .",
    "however we would expect any such contamination to have made the  column measurement attributed to ngc  7582 to appear lower than the  measurement , rather than higher .",
    "the nearby clusters abell 1111s and sersic 159 - 03 also posed potential sources of contamination for the  observations , and could have yielded an erroneous column measurement .",
    "examination of the  archives shows that the source and background observations had the me proportional counter offset and with a roll angle designed to minimize the contamination from sersic 159 - 03 .",
    "however , given the large number of contaminating sources in the   me field , any claim of column variability in ngc  7582 requires confirmation using further observations of the source .",
    "in the cases of ngc  526a , ngc  7314 , mcg-5 - 23 - 16 and ngc  2110 in group b , plus ngc  5252 and ic  5063 from group a , the soft emission exceeds that expected from stellar origins by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "these luminous soft components could originate from scattered nuclear flux , or leakage of the primary continuum through unattenuated line - of - sight .",
    "the history of the soft x - ray flux could , in principle , distinguish between these two .",
    "variations in absorbing column could indicate that the absorber had a variable ionization - state , covering fraction or column .",
    "analysis of a _ rosat _ hri observation of ngc  5252 ( made in 1995 july ) showed the soft flux to be a factor of several lower than that observed by  ( 1994 january ) .",
    "as the  spectrum suggests the 0.5 - 2.0 kev flux is dominated by scattered or unattenuated nuclear emission this variability favors partial - covering of the absorber or a sub - parsec size for the scattering region .",
    "our analysis of the _ rosat _ pspc observation of ic  5063 showed the soft flux to be consistent with that observed by allowing no constraint in that case .",
    "x - ray column variability has been claimed for ngc  2110 on timescales of years ( hayashi  1996 ) based upon x - ray observations covering heao-1 ( 1978 ) to  ( 1994 ) , although we note that it is difficult to make a conclusive comparison based upon different spectral fits performed across a variety of bandpasses , and this result needs confirmation .",
    "ngc  526a showed strong spectral changes , consistent with column variability , on a timescale of years across five  observations ( turner & pounds 1989 ) .",
    "historic x - ray observations of ngc  7314 and mcg-5 - 23 - 16 show column measurements consistent with no variation .    a power - law source partially - covered by neutral material would be expected to show a leaking fraction with the same spectrum as that observed in the hard x - ray regime .",
    "simple electron scattering of the hard continuum is also expected to yield the same spectrum in scattered x - rays , as the primary continuum .",
    "however , many datasets marginally prefer the double power - law model ( paper  i ) with some sources showing a steep soft x - ray component , and others a hardening of the spectrum to higher energies .",
    "this indicates some spectral curvature which is not accounted for by the aforementioned models",
    ". this could be due to curvature in the underlying continuum . however",
    ", partial - covering by ionized material could also yield a difference in soft and hard spectra .",
    "this is the preferred model for seyfert  1 galaxies ( reynolds 1997 , g97 ) and for ngc  2110 and ngc  5252 from the type-2 sample .",
    "thus we consider the model in more depth in the discussion .    in summary",
    ", there is only tentative evidence for column variability in the sample sources .",
    "the the spectral shapes can generally be described either by a continuum attenuated by a patchy or ionized absorber , or by the presence of a second emission component .",
    "x - ray monitoring of one or more well - chosen type-2 seyferts will help clarify the picture .",
    "both of our subsamples of type-2 seyferts show an iron k@xmath0 profile which contains a significant red - wing at the same level as that observed in the seyfert-1 sample .",
    "this skewed profile implies that type-2 seyferts contain an iron k@xmath0 line component from a reprocessor close to the central black hole .",
    "furthermore this reprocessor is implied to be orientated preferably face - on to our line - of - sight .",
    "this result is contrary to unification models , which predict the inner regions of type-2 seyfert galaxies are observed preferentially edge - on .",
    "this is all particularly interesting in the light of the fact that the host galaxies of type-2 seyferts are also observed preferentially face - on .",
    "specifically , kirhakos & steiner ( 1990 ) find the distribution of inclinations to be indistinguishable between type-1 and type-2 hosts when they consider a sample of 288 seyfert galaxies .",
    "furthermore , both seyfert type-1 and type-2 samples are observed preferentially face - on compared to a large control sample of normal galaxies .",
    "even ngc  1068 and mrk  3 , which appear to be observed in scattered and reflected x - rays , are decidedly face - on ( with b / a=0.89 and 0.72 , respectively ) .",
    "however , maiolino & reike ( 1995 ) made a study where the `` intermediate '' seyfert 1.8  1.9 galaxies were treated separately to the classical seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "they found that both seyfert  1 and seyfert  2 galaxies are preferentially face - on , but the `` intermediate '' seyferts are preferentially edge - on .",
    "this result inferred that the absorption in the seyfert  1.8  1.9 galaxies might often be due to material in the plane of the host galaxy rather than circumnuclear material .",
    "nelgs are `` intermediate '' seyferts on the basis of their optical properties , however , as the mean iron k@xmath0 profiles clearly indicate a preference for a face - on orientation of the inner regions , there can not be many edge - on sources in our sample or the mean iron k@xmath0 profiles would not be so similar to the mean profile for type-1 seyferts .",
    "if the putative accretion disk is totally decoupled from the orientation of the host galaxy , then we should observe a variety of inclinations in the iron k@xmath0 profiles , resulting in a mean profile of @xmath94 for the sample .",
    "thus the preference for a face - on orientation of the nuclear regions and the host might suggest a link between the angular momentum of the two . this might be expected if the accretion process ultimately feeds on material lying in the plane of the galaxy . if this is true , then it is difficult to understand why the putative obscuring torus , which ( if it is present ) must lie between these two systems , would be decoupled from this preferred orientation",
    ". this problem might be avoided if the absorber is a distribution of clouds , and the type-1 or type-2 nature of a source is simply determined by whether or not a cloud lay across the observers line - of - sight .",
    "differences in the distribution and composition of the clouds could then account for differences in observed properties .",
    "several seyfert galaxies vary back and forth between type-1 and type-2 properties on timescales of years . in at least some sources",
    "the observed behaviour has been attributed to variations in the reddening , consistent with clouds of dust moving across the line - of - sight ( e.g. goodrich 1989 ) .",
    "the timescales and repetition of this type of behaviour argues against both evolutionary models and orientation of large - scale structures of the absorbing material to explain the difference between seyfert classes , although the `` orientation effect '' of a cloud being in the line of sight is consistent with the observations .    in the context of cloud models ,",
    "another possibility is that all classes of seyfert - type agn show a similar mean iron k@xmath0 profile because the line is produced by reprocessing in a spherically symmetric distribution of material .",
    "spherical accretion of clouds of material could produce a line showing the strong gravitational effects observed , but with the same profile observed from each viewing direction .",
    "the construction of a mean profile for a sample of edge - on seyferts would test this theory .",
    "the intermediate seyfert galaxies might provide an edge - on sample .",
    "alternatively , kirhakos & steiner ( 1990 ) find that iras galaxies are observed preferentially edge - on .",
    "if the orientation of the host galaxy is associated with that of the inner accretion disk / reprocessing region then iras galaxies should show an iron k@xmath0 profile indicative of edge - on systems , although such a line will be broad , and possibly difficult to detect .",
    "we note that the edge - on galaxy ngc  2992 ( b / a=0.27 ) shows an iron k@xmath0 line profile with a blue wing ( paper  i , paper  2 ) .",
    "weaver  ( 1996 ) suggest that the large equivalent width of the iron k@xmath0 line in ngc  2992 is due to a lag of several years between the direct and reprocessed components .",
    "the data are consistent with a narrow component of high equivalent width , as suggested by weaver  ( 1996 ) , plus a disk - line component from an edge - on accretion disk , which would support a connection between the orientation of the host galaxy and the inner regime",
    ". however , the data are also consistent with contributions to the iron k@xmath0 line profile from highly ionized species of iron . a search for variability could distinguish between these possibilities , as the occurrence of rapid variability in the blue wing would favor the disk - line scenario .",
    "the existence of `` ionization cones '' in a dozen or so seyfert-2 galaxies ( e.g. pogge 1988 , tadhunter and tsvetanov 1989 ) poses an interesting problem if we assume the inner regions are viewed with a face - on orientation .",
    "such cones should only be seen in systems observed at a different angle to the escape direction of the radiation . however , many ionization cones are one - sided .",
    "this would be expected if we observe close to the direction of the collimated radiation , as one side of the cone will escape in a direction almost directly away from us . in this case",
    "the cone will be foreshortened and the back - side will be heavily absorbed by any intervening galactic material .",
    "we note that one of the best examples of a two - sided cone is in ngc  5252 , in which the host galaxy is observed at an intermediate orientation ( b / a=0.37 ) .",
    "the fact that observations of the iron k@xmath0 line profiles imply a near face - on geometry for the inner regions of both seyfert types 1 and 2 necessitates a discussion of ways in which factors other than the orientation of the absorbing material can explain the observed differences between the two classes .",
    "the obscuration of the nlr is similar in optically selected seyfert-1 and seyfert-2 galaxies , indicating that the obscuration responsible for the differences between these classes is located within the nlr , or out of the line - of - sight to the nlr ( lawrence & elvis 1982 , de zotti & gaskell 1985 ) . in nelgs",
    "the x - ray absorbing columns are @xmath95 ( ngc  7314 to eso  103-g35 ) while the optical lines imply an attenuation @xmath96 ( assuming a galactic gas - to - dust ratio ) .",
    "this implies that the x - ray absorber lies within the blr , or is highly ionized , otherwise it would produce stronger suppression of the blr than that which is observed .    in seyfert-2 galaxies",
    "x - ray column densities are @xmath97 or greater .",
    "extinction of the broad lines occurs for columns in excess of @xmath98 . on this basis",
    ", the x - ray absorption in seyfert-2 galaxies can only be said to exceed that required to fully suppress the broad optical lines , yielding no constraint on the location of the absorber .",
    "granato , danese and franceschini ( 1997 ) compare the infrared broad - band spectra and spectroscopy results with",
    "x - ray spectra of a sample of type-2 seyferts ( smith & done 1996 ) . for convenience",
    "we define the infrared extinction as @xmath99 and the x - ray extinction as @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 is the observed flux , and @xmath103 is the intrinsic flux .",
    "granato  find the infrared extinction , @xmath99 is approximately consistent with the x - ray extinction , @xmath100 , for columns @xmath104 , while @xmath105 for @xmath106 , and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "thus , their finding indicates that where there is a large x - ray absorption , the material likely sits predominantly within the dust sublimation radius .",
    "evidence for an ionized absorber covering ngc  2110 and ngc  5252 makes it interesting to examine the general results from such a model , particularly in the light of the strong evidence for ionized absorbers in most seyfert-1 galaxies ( e.g. reynolds 1997 , g97 ) .    to examine the unification of type-1 and type-2 seyfert galaxies we examined the distribution of column , ionization parameter and luminosity for both types .",
    "we took the seyfert-1 results from g97 .",
    "those sources were analyzed in the same way as our sample of type-2 seyferts , allowing a direct comparison to be made .",
    "3 shows @xmath109 and @xmath5 , the ionization - state and column of ionized material versus ( unabsorbed ) x - ray luminosity adapted from a figure in g97 ( group b sources are marked with stars , group a with circles , seyfert-1 galaxies with open squares ) .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that while the mean column appears to be higher for type-2 , some seyfert-1 galaxies are also consistent with having large columns of circumnuclear material ( which is so highly ionized that it does not provide much opacity below @xmath110 kev ) .",
    "examination of fig .",
    "3 shows that there is a large overlap in intrinsic ( absorption - corrected ) luminosity of the type-2 and type-1 sample sources , although the mean intrinsic luminosity of the type-2 seyferts is lower .",
    "for gas of the same density and distance from the ionizing source , then the ionization parameter is , by definition , proportional to the ionizing luminosity .",
    "the seyfert  1 sample appears consistent with @xmath111 , and hence the circumnuclear gas is consistent with similar density and location across the type-1 sample .",
    "however , type-2 seyferts are clearly inconsistent with that picture , most notably due to several sources absorbed by material of very low ionization - state .",
    "we also note that overlaying three quasars on this plot ( marked with solid squares ; from george  1997b ) indicates that there is no simple proportionality between @xmath109 and @xmath112 .",
    "this indicates that the absorbing material in type-2 seyferts exists under significantly different conditions than that in type-1 galaxies .",
    "differences in gas density , geometry and location between individual objects could cause the observed effects .",
    "type-1 seyferts do not show such pronounced suppression of the broad optical lines as type-2 sources with the same nuclear ( x - ray ) luminosity .",
    "this indicates systematic differences in the location of the dust sublimation radius between classes of agn .",
    "reverberation studies have indicated blr sizes @xmath113pc ( peterson  1993 ; netzer 1990 ) , although the blr probably extends over an order of magnitude in radius ( korista  1995 ) . for bolometric luminosities @xmath114 ( appropriate for our sample sources )",
    "we estimate the blr to be @xmath115 cm ( @xmath3 a few light days ) .",
    "barvainis ( 1987 ) shows that the dust sublimation radius , @xmath116 pc , where @xmath117 is the uv luminosity in units of @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the grain sublimation temperature in units of 1500 k. order - of - magnitude estimates show the dust sublimation radius to lie close to or just outside of the blr .",
    "barvainis also notes that the highest sublimation temperature occurs for dust composed of graphite grains , and is @xmath120 k. dust containing silicate grains would have a lower temperature and hence a larger sublimation radius .",
    "evidently , different mixtures of dust grains will allow the sublimation radius to change by up to a factors of a few .",
    "the size of the dust grains yields an even bigger effect .",
    "laor & draine ( 1993 ) show that graphite grains of size @xmath121 can exist almost an order of magnitude closer to the nucleus than grains of size @xmath122 .",
    "thus differences in the distribution of grain sizes could allow significant differences in the location of @xmath123 relative to the blr in different sources , @xmath123 will be closer to the nuclei in those sources with the largest dust grains .",
    "however , as also shown by laor & draine ( 1993 ) some distributions of grain size yield dust which is ineffective at reddening , i.e. the effective extinction can have a flat dependance over a large frequency range .",
    "the data require that for seyfert-2 galaxies , the blr is deeply situated well within @xmath123 , for nelgs the blr is probably very close to @xmath123 because the broad lines suffer some obscuration .",
    "thus differences in dust content and in the distribution of grain sizes could be the key to unification of type-1 and type-2 seyfert galaxies .",
    "in fact konigl & kartje ( 1994 ) suggested a dusty wind model to unify agn , with partially - ionized gas in the inner regions of the wind accounting for the bulk of x - ray absorption seen in face - on sources .",
    "spectral variability in the optical and x - ray regimes could be driven by changes in the nuclear flux , which will move the effective radii of ionization and sublimation .",
    "differences in the distribution of circumnuclear material and in the total mass of gas surrounding the nuclei may also play a role . a model where clouds of optically thick material cause the x - ray obscuration",
    "can explain many observed properties ( guilbert & rees 1988 ) . the location , size and column density of the clouds can determine whether or not column variability or a leaking fraction of nuclear flux are observed .",
    "compton - reflection can occur from the surface of the blobs ( nandra & george 1994 ) while scattering of nuclear radiation can occur from a region of hot gas , so long as there are some unattenuated lines of sight by which to view this .",
    "collimation of radiation ( to produce ionization cones ) could also occur , if the blobs are distributed around a preferred plane .",
    "interestingly , maiolino  ( 1995 ) find differences in infrared colors indicating that the host galaxies of type-2 nuclei have significantly higher levels of starburst activity than type-1 nuclei .",
    "this starburst activity occurs close to the nucleus , and as starburst regions contain large amounts of dusty gas , perhaps the presence of these starburst regions results in a different gas and dust content in type-2 seyfert galaxies .",
    "thus we concur with the suggestion of maiolino  that consideration of the starburst regions seems likely to provide an important component of unification models .",
    "differences in dust content of the circumnuclear gas might also be related to the apparent preferential occurrence of masers in type-2 seyferts .",
    "the relationship between a high x - ray absorbing column and the existence of water masers in type-2 seyferts ( braatz , wilson & henkel 1997 ) indicates that the material in which the maser amplification occurs is related to significant x - ray opacity . _",
    "if _ the molecular gas is in a well - defined plane then masers will be preferentially observed in sources viewed within a few degrees of that plane .",
    "the sources in our original sample which are known to have masers are ngc  1068 , ngc  4945 and eso103-g35 ( braatz , wilson & henkel 1997 ) .",
    "ngc  1068 and ngc  4945 are so highly absorbed that the x - ray spectra are seen only in reprocessed photons , and the  data are consistent with the high degree of opacity expected from an edge - on masing disk .",
    "this again raises the interesting question as to the relationship of any preferred planes of material on size scales of the galaxy , the torus / masing disk or clouds , and the nucleus .",
    "the fact that masers are only observed in type-2 seyferts might indicate that conditions in those agn result in a layer of shielded masing material .",
    "kartje , konigl & elitzur ( 1996 ) propose that maser flux arises from clouds in a magnetized accretion disk and that these clouds are shielded from the nuclear flux by gas and dust .",
    "they suggest the inner edge - of the maser is dictated by the dust sublimation radius , where effective shielding begins .",
    "examination of the iron k@xmath0 line from a sample of nelgs and seyfert-2 galaxies shows profiles similar to those observed in seyfert-1 galaxies , and indicative of an origin in an accretion disk orientated face - on .",
    "this result is contrary to unification models , which predict the inner regions of seyfert-2 galaxies to be observed edge - on .",
    "the preference for a face - on orientation of both the accretion disk and host galaxy of type-1 and type-2 seyfert galaxies poses some questions as to the orientation and geometry of gas comprising the circumnuclear absorbing material .",
    "if the absorber is composed of clouds then differences in gas density , size of dust grains and dust composition and the distribution of the clouds seem a likely explanation of the observed differences in the x - ray and optical absorption properties of seyfert-1 galaxies , seyfert-2 galaxies and nelgs .",
    "these results indicate that further refinement is required for unified models for agn .",
