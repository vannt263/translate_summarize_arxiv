    "the high - energy photons and power - law afterglow characteristic of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) , as well as the existence of coincident broad - lined type ic supernovae ( sne  ic - bl ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , are consistent with the creation of a relativistic jet after the core of a massive star collapses to form a compact object @xcite .",
    "theoretical modeling of possible progenitor systems strongly favors massive , rapidly spinning stars @xcite , because high angular momentum is likely required to form the relativistic jets .",
    "these massive stars must also lose their outer hydrogen and helium envelopes , or burn them through internal mixing @xcite , because all associated sne have had type ic - bl spectra which show no evidence for hydrogen or helium .",
    "the metal content of lgrb host galaxies has received special attention because of the strong effect of metals on stellar mass loss rates . the outflowing stellar winds from massive stars grow in strength with increasing metallicity ( @xmath9 ) of the envelope @xcite approximately as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "single wolf - rayet stars with low metallicity are expected to have higher rates of rotation than their high - metallicity counterparts , and a reasonable expectation might be that lgrbs would occur more frequently in metal - poor environments , where single stars may retain more of their angular momentum before core collapse .",
    "however , recent observations have suggested that many massive stars have binary companions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "we show an example of an lgrb that probably exploded in a metal - poor dwarf satellite of a metal - rich galaxy .",
    "a plausible possibility is that a fraction of the lgrbs whose positions have coincided with metal - rich galaxies may have less luminous , metal - poor host galaxies that are difficult to detect .",
    "the low redshift ( @xmath11 ) of grb 130702a allows the separation of the dwarf neighbor host from a massive primary galaxy in ground - based images , and makes possible the spectroscopic detection of weak emission lines from the dwarf galaxy s metal - poor gas .",

    "recently , @xcite inferred supersolar metallicities from zinc and sulfur absorption features for two @xmath64 galaxies found in the afterglow spectrum of an lgrb .",
    "this analysis of the host galaxy of grb 130702a provides the first example of an lgrb that exploded in a dwarf , metal - poor satellite of a massive , metal - rich galaxy . in this case , the dwarf galaxy s projection onto the sky from our perspective on earth placed it away from the primary galaxy . for other examples of lgrbs that explode in dwarf satellite galaxies , however , the dwarf galaxy may be superimposed on a metal - rich galaxy .",
    "this suggests the need to obtain a spectrum at the explosion site of the lgrb to attempt to detect the nebular emission of metal - poor gas , as well as high - resolution follow - up imaging .",

    "this pattern at low redshifts where host galaxies are more accessible suggests that low progenitor metallicity may be important to generate explosions with high ejecta velocities .",
