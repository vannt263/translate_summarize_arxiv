    "since parker set down the foundations for solar @xmath2 dynamo theory in his classic 1955 paper , many solar cycle models have been proposed , for example , the convection zone ( cz ) dynamo models @xcite , the overshoot layer ( ol ) dynamo models ( e.g. , rdiger &  brandenburg 1995 ) , the interface ( if ) dynamo models @xcite , and the babcock - leigton ( bl ) dynamo models @xcite . in cz dynamos ,",
    "differential rotation ( the @xmath1-effect ) in the solar interior shears weak poloidal magnetic fields into intense toroidal fields .",
    "meanwhile twisting motions associated with buoyancy , turbulent convection , and the coriolis force transform toroidal fields back into poloidal fields ( the @xmath0-effect ) .",
    "since most of solar magnetic flux is present in flux tubes and they are subject to magnetic buoyancy instabilities , if there is no force to balance the buoyancy , they can not be stored in the convection zone for a timescale comparable to the cycle period @xcite .    in order to circumvent the difficulty of flux storage in the main bulk of the convection zone",
    ", ol dynamos were proposed .",
    "observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rot ] ) in fact show that most of the shear ( the @xmath1-effect ) is concentrated in a thin layer near the bottom of the convection zone , known as the tachocline .",
    "this was seen as evidence that the tachocline is of key importance for the working of the solar dynamo . such dynamos , use the same concept as cz dynamos .",
    "in such dynamos , the butterfly diagram comes out right , but the radial field is found to be nearly in phase with the toroidal field , instead of being in antiphase as observed , and the cycle period tends to be too short for thin layer models .    unlike both cz and ol dynamos , in which the @xmath0- and @xmath1-effects are assumed to be cospatial , in if dynamos the @xmath0-effect operates on the high - diffusivity side of an interface , while the @xmath1-effect is limited to the low - diffusivity side .",
    "their attractive feature is that the toroidal field generated on the low diffusivity side can be made arbitrarily strong by reducing the value of magnetic diffusivity there .",
    "the base of the convection zone , where the convection zone and the radiative zone are separated naturally , provides a physical interface .    unlike cz ,",
    "ol , and if dynamos , which interpret the butterfly diagram as a dynamo wave , bl dynamos essentially work like a conveyor belt : the poleward meridional circulation near the surface transports the poloidal fields towards the poles at high latitudes , giving rise to the poleward branch of the butterfly diagram . at the poles ,",
    "the fields are advected down to the bottom of the convection zone where the shear converts them into toroidal fields that get amplified while advected towards the equator .",
    "once these are strong enough , they are supposed to form buoyantly emerging loops at low latitudes that give rise to active regions .",
    "the coriolis force lends an inclination to the loop planes , introducing an @xmath0-effect to regenerate the poloidal field .",
    "in such models , the low - latitude confinement of strong activity comes out naturally since the toroidal field is amplified by shear as it is advected equatorwards , and the extended butterfly diagram is reproduced approximately in the sense that the latitude where the two branches part tends to be too high .",
    "a serious problem is that the approach only works with an unrealistically low value for the turbulent diffusivity in the convection zone in order to keep the two parts of the conveyor belt separated .",
    "a successful solar cycle model should interpret the following observational facts :    1 .   the 22-year cycle period ; 2 .   the characteristic migration pattern ( extended butterfly diagram , e.g. , makarov &  sivaraman 1989 ) ; 3 .   the confinement of strong activity to low heliographic latitudes @xmath3 ; 4 .",
    "the phase dilemmas @xcite : 1 .   at low latitudes",
    "the radial field is in an approximately @xmath4 phase lag compared to the toroidal field at the same latitude ; 2 .",
    "the poleward branch is in a @xmath5 phase lag with respect to the equatorward branch ; 5 .",
    "most of the magnetic flux is present in a strongly intermittent form , concentraed into strong flux tubes @xcite .",
    "helioseismic observations also impose rigorous constraints on the model :    1 .   solar internal differential rotation rate from inversions of helioseismic observations ( e.g. , antia et al .",
    "1998 ) should be used in the model ; 2 .",
    "helioseismic inversions made by antia , chitre , and thompson ( 2000 ) indicate that there is a magnetic field of approximately 20 kg strength peaked at a depth of @xmath6 in 1996 , rather than at the base of the convection zone .",
    "furthermore , the model should reproduce the observed cyclic variations of total solar irradiance , solar effective temperature , and solar radius :    1 .",
    "total solar irradiance varies in phase with the solar cycle activity , having an amplitude of @xmath7 @xcite ; 2 .",
    "solar effective temperature varies in phase with the solar cycle activity , having an amplitude of @xmath9 @xcite ; 3 .",
    "solar radius also varies in phase with the solar cycle activity , having an amplitude of 20 mas @xcite .    using these constraints",
    ", we can see that none of the above solar dynamos are satisfactory .",
    "in particular , criterion 7 rules out the last three models since they predict that solar magnetic fields peak at the base of the convection zone , leaving cz dynamos as the unique candidate .",
    "recently , li and sofia ( 2001 ) have shown that a magnetic field of @xmath10 kg located at @xmath11 can reproduce the observed cyclic variations of total solar irradiance , solar effective temperature , and solar radius .",
    "if we use the helioseimic internal differential rotation in the cz dynamo , the cz dynamo will automatically satisfy criteria  @xmath12 . in order to meet criteron 5 ,",
    "the magnetic fields should be considered in the form of strong flux tubes . as a body ,",
    "a flux tube in the convection zone experiences not only a magnetic buoyancy since gas in it is less dense than the surroundings @xcite , but also a dynamic pressure if flow is present .",
    "stratification provides a preferred direction ; turbulence in the convection zone is likely to be anisotropic . in fact , numerical simulations of the solar outer convection zone @xcite indicate a major presence of downward - moving plumes .",
    "this suggests that the dynamic pressure of the downward - moving flow may push down the magnetic flux tubes to prevent them from rising , until they reach certain depth in the convection zone .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend the classical cz dynamo model by taking into account the magnetic buoyancy and downward flow effects .",
    "we show in  [ sect : s1 ] that these two effects can be incorporated into the mean field dynamo equations by modifying the turbulent diffusivity @xmath13 . in ",
    "[ sect : s2 ] we linearly analyze the dynamo equations to obtain the observable quantities of the model . in  [ sect : s3 ] we use the theoretical findings to interpret the observational facts listed above .",
    "finally , in  [ sect : s4 ] we summarize the results .",
    "we consider a magnetic flux tube with radius @xmath14 and length @xmath15 .",
    "its magnetic field @xmath16 is assumed to be uniform . as usual , we decompose it into a toroidal and a poloidal component , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the azimuthal unit vector , @xmath19 is the toroidal field component , and @xmath20 is the ( toroidal ) vector potential of the poloidal field .",
    "the local hydrostatic equilibrium of the flux tube in the solar interior requires @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the total and internal gas pressure , respectively . assuming that this equilibrium in the flux tube is reached solely by adjusting its density , then the internal density @xmath24 is related to the normal density @xmath25 by @xmath26 as a result , the density reduction of the magnetic flux tube is @xmath27 the reduced density inside the flux tube produces a buoyancy , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 is smaller than the pressure scale height so that we can consider that the gas density of the flux tube is uniform . in this case",
    ", the total mass contained in the flux tube equals @xmath30 therefore , the buoyant acceleration @xmath31 can be expressed by the gravitational acceleration @xmath29 , total pressure @xmath22 and the magnetic field strength @xmath19 as follows : @xmath32    if there is no downward flow to balance this pressure , the only force that goes agaist the buoyant force is the aerodynamic drag , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the velocity of rise and @xmath35 is the drag coefficient .",
    "taking into account both the buoyant force and the drag force , as done by parker ( 1975 ) , the terminal velocity of rise occurs for @xmath36 , yielding the rate of rise @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pressure scale height , @xmath39 is the alfvn speed .",
    "the rise time to the surface is smaller than the required field amplification time of about 10 years by the classical dynamo theory , as estimated by parker ( 1975 )",
    ".    however , numerical simulations of the sun s outer convection zone made , e.g. by nordlund ( 1999 ) , indicate a major presence of downward - moving plumes of high velocity .",
    "this downward flow has an inward dynamic pressure @xmath40 .",
    "if this pressure can balance the buoyant force of the flux tube , then the flux tube can be stored in the convection zone so that it can be amplified by the @xmath2 dynamo .",
    "antia et al ( 2000 ) employ the observed splittings of solar oscillation frequencies to separate the effects of interior solar rotation , and to estimate the contribution from a large - scale magnetic field . after subtracting out the estimated contribution from rotation",
    ", there is some residual signal in the even splitting coefficients .",
    "this may be explained by a magnetic field of approximately 20 kg strength located at @xmath41 in 1996 . since the density here is of order @xmath42 , and",
    "the downward velocity for the plumes is of order @xmath43 cm s@xmath44 @xcite , the estimated dynamical pressure of the plumes , @xmath45 , is equal to or larger then @xmath46 dyne @xmath47 .",
    "the size of @xmath45 is comparable with the magnetic pressure , @xmath48 , for a field strength of @xmath49 kg .",
    "therefore , as a body , a magnetic flux tube experiences not only a buoyant force , but also a dynamic pressure of downflows .",
    "the total pushdown force of downward plumes equals to the dynamic pressure ( @xmath40 ) times the total cross section of the plumes ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the dynamic acceleration @xmath51 can be expressed as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath53 when @xmath54 , @xmath55 when @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the fractional area of the downflows .",
    "the upward - moving plumes underneath the flux tube ( @xmath53 ) accelerate the magnetic buoyant diffusion of the tube , while the downward - moving plumes above the flux tube ( @xmath55 ) go against the magnetic diffusion .",
    "these downflows act as an anti - diffusion process .",
    "the magnetic field in a flux tube can be considered to be a `` mean field '' since the mean - field concept is relative in mean field magnetohydrodynamics ( e.g. , krause and rdler 1980 ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", it depends on the spatio - temporal range over which the average is made . for the mean field in a flux tube ,",
    "the spatio - temporal range is the volume and lifetime of a typical magnetic flux tube . with this in mind",
    ", the field in a flux tube obeys the classic dynamo equation @xcite , @xmath58 using this equation , we can not study the formation of flux tubes from the large - scale magnetic field , but we can study if the flux tube fields can be amplified .",
    "we assume a pure rotation motion @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the angular velocity .",
    "this will cause the @xmath1-effect .",
    "@xmath61 contains the @xmath0-effect , @xmath62 , and the magnetic diffusion processes , which are caused by the turbulent pressure , @xmath63 , by the magnetic buoyant force , @xmath64 , and by the dynamic pressure of downward - moving plumes , @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , @xmath66 the magnetic diffusion caused by the microscopic gas collision motion , has been included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamo ] ) in terms of the classic magnetic diffusivity @xmath67 . for convection",
    ", @xmath0 can be approximately expressed as @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mean helicity over the correlation time @xmath70 .",
    "= 8.cm    in order to work out the various magnetic diffusitivites mentioned above , we observe that the diffusivity of a force is proportional to its impulse per unit mass .",
    "the impulse is defined as the force times its action time .",
    "the impulse per unit mass has the dimension of acceleration times time .",
    "the action time can be taken to be the propagation time of a magnetic perturbation across the diameter of the flux tube . since the characteristic propagation velocity of magnetic perturbations is the alfvn velocity @xmath71 , the action time is estimated to be @xmath72 .",
    "however , diffusivity has the dimension of acceleration times time times length .",
    "the charateristic length for a flux tube is its length @xmath15 .",
    "we use this length @xmath15 to meet the need of dimensionality for the buoyant and the dynamic diffusivity .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath73 the magnetic turbulent diffusivity @xmath74 is known @xcite for an isotropic turbulence , where @xmath75 is the turbulent velocity .",
    "in summary , we define @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are given by ( [ eq : betab ] ) and ( [ eq : betad ] ) , respectively . as a result , the hydromagnetic induction equation becomes the dynamic equation of a magnetic flux tube , @xmath79 since @xmath13 depends on @xmath16 , this equation is nonlinear .",
    "the flux tube model equation obtained in the previous section is a nonlinear partial - differential vector equation .",
    "since such equation is difficult to solve analytically , while a simple linear analysis may reveal some important characteristics about its solution , we analyze and solve the equation in the linear approximation in this paper . unlike numerical simulations , the linear analysis can not take into account full nonlinearity though it reveals some nonlinear effects such as critical magnetic fields of a flux tube .      substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : b ] ) into eq .  ( [ eq : model ] ) , and linearizing the result with respect to the perturbation of @xmath19 and @xmath20 near @xmath80 and @xmath81 , denoted by @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we obtain two linear equations that govern @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 in the local cartesian frame @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",

    "in contrast , when the dynamic pressure of the downward moving plumes is larger than the buoyant pressure of the flux tube , @xmath93 can become negative .      in order to investigate the linear instability , we try the wavelike solutions of the form @xmath95 , \\label{eq : solve1}\\\\    a ' & = & a'_0 \\exp[i(\\omega t-{{\\bf k}}\\cdot{{\\bf x } } ) ] , \\label{eq : solve2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is complex , while the other variables are real . substituting eqs .

    "therefore , the condition @xmath111 leads to @xmath112 when this condition is satisfied we have two magnetic flux tube waves propagating in the opposite dirrection .",
    "these two waves have the same period .    in order to calculate @xmath113 ,",

    "the butterfly diagram implies that both branches share the whole length , so we assume @xmath123 for the equatorward / poleward branch in the northern hemisphere of the sun .",

    "helioseismic data allow us to probe the rotation rate in the solar interior as a function of radius and latitude @xcite .",

    "since the observed length of the solar cycles is equal to about 22 years , this table shows that the cycle should originate from the surface layer with @xmath125 , which is in agreement with the inferred depth from helioseismic data by antia , chitre and thompson ( 2000 ) , who found that the solar magnetic field peaks at @xmath41 .",
    "the period also depends on latitude .",
    "if we use the observed period ( 22 years ) as a criterion , this table indicates that the low- ( high- ) latitude branch originates from the latitude 35@xmath126 ( 40@xmath126 ) . since @xmath127 and @xmath128 for the low - latitude branch , the magnetic flux tubes near the latitude 35@xmath126 and radius @xmath129 move upwards and equatorwards . since @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the high - latitude branch , the magnetic flux tubes near 40@xmath126 and @xmath132 move downwards and polewards",
    "this scenario is in agreement with observations @xcite .    for different branches we have to use different @xmath0 values to produce the desired period at the mid latitude .",
