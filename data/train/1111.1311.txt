    "from a historical point of view , fractional calculus provides us with a set of axioms and methods to extend the concept of a derivative operator from integer order n to arbitrary order @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is a real or complex value .",
    "@xmath1    in the sense of ( [ art14first ] ) fractional calculus has been frequently applied in the area of image processing , see e.g. [ @xcite ] , [ @xcite ] , [ @xcite ] .",
    "alternatively we may consider fractional calculus as a specific prescription to extend the definition of a local operator to the nonlocal case . in this lecture",
    ", we will present a covariant , multidimensional generalization of the fractional derivative definition , which may be applied to any bound operator on the riemannian space .    as a first application",
    ", we will propose a specific non - local extension of the modified local laplace - operator , which is widely used in problems of image processing .",
    "we will especially compare the local to the nonlocal approach for 3d - shape recovery from a set of 2d aperture afflicted slide sequences , which may be obtained e.g. in confocal microscopy or autofocus algorithms [ @xcite ] , [ @xcite ] .",
    "it will be shown , that a major improvement of results is achieved for the nonlocal version of the modified laplace - operator .",
    "we will propose a reinterpretation of the fractional calculus as a specific procedure for a non - local extension of arbitrary local operators .",
    "for that purpose , we start with the liouville definition of the left and right fractional integral [ @xcite ] : @xmath2 with a slight modification of the fractional parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is in the interval @xmath4 . consequently for the limiting case @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 both coincide with the unit - operator and for @xmath8 @xmath6 and @xmath7 both correspond to the standard integral operator .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 may be combined to define a regularized liouville integral [ @xcite ] : @xmath9 where we have introduced the symmetric shift - operator : @xmath10 the regularized fractional liouville - caputo derivative may now be defined as : @xmath11 with the abbreviation @xmath12 . this definition of a fractional derivative coincides with feller s [ @xcite ] definition @xmath13 for the special case @xmath14 .",
    "we may interpret @xmath15 as a non - localization operator , which is applied to the local derivative operator to determine a specific non - local extension of the same operator .",
    "therefore the fractional extension of the derivative operator is separated into a sequential application of the standard derivative followed by a non - localization operation .",
    "the classical interpretation of a fractional integral is changed from the inverse operation of a fractional derivative to a more general interpretation of a non - localization procedure , which may be easily interpreted in the area of image processing as a blur effect .",
    "this is a conceptual new approach , since it may be easily extended to other operators e.g. higher order derivatives or space dependent operators , e.g. for @xmath16 we obtain : @xmath17 which is nothing else but the riesz [ @xcite ] definition of a fractional derivative .",
    "therefore we define the following fractional extension of a local operator @xmath18 to the non - local case @xmath19    as the covariant generalization of the liouville - caputo fractional derivative to arbitrary operators on @xmath20 .",
    "this definition may be easily extended to the multidimensional case , interpreting the variable @xmath21 as a measure of distance .    in two dimensions , with @xmath22 and with @xmath23 @xmath24 explicitly reads : @xmath25 which is normalized such , that the eigenvalue spectrum for : @xmath26    with the eigenfunctions @xmath27 follows as :    @xmath28    it should be noted , that the validity range for @xmath0 spans from @xmath29 , since we deal with a two - dimensional problem .",
    "obviously within the framework of signal processing , the non - localization operator may be interpreted as a low - pass filter .    in the following sections",
    ", we will use this operator for a well defined extension of the standard algorithm used for 3d - shape recovery from aperture afflicted 2d - slide sequences to a generalized , fractional nonlocal version , which results in a very stable procedure with drastically reduced errors .",
    "we will first present the minimal standard method and its limitations in the next section .     and",

    "in a set @xmath33 of @xmath34 2d - slides with increasing focal distance @xmath35 , @xmath36 every slide contains areas with focused as well as defocused parts of the specimen considered . in the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present two examples from a slide - sequence of a spherical object with radius @xmath37 located at @xmath38 in the x , y - plane , where the focal plane was chosen to be @xmath39 and @xmath30 respectively .    for a 3d - shape recovery in a first step for a given slide",
    "the parts being in focus have to be extracted . for a textured object ,",
    "areas in focus are dominated by a larger amount of high frequency contributions , while for out of focus parts mainly the low frequency amount of texture survives .",
    "consequently an appropriate operator to determine the high - frequency domains is the modified laplacian @xmath40 given e.g. by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the absolute value .    in the discrete case with a symmetrically discretized function @xmath43 on a rectangular domain @xmath44 and @xmath45 : @xmath46 with stepsize @xmath47 in both x- and y - direction , the same operator is given by : @xmath48 and @xmath49 elsewhere , where the free parameter @xmath50 has to be chosen according to the nyquist - shannon sampling theorem [ @xcite ] to be of order of the inverse average wavelength @xmath51 of the texture applied to the object considered @xmath52 a requirement , which can be fulfilled only locally for random generated textures and for regular textures on curved surfaces respectively .",
    "an application of the modified laplacian to every slide in a set @xmath53 leads to a set of intensity values @xmath54 at a given pixel - position at @xmath55 : @xmath56 in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the result of an application of the discrete modified laplacian with @xmath57 to the original slides presented in the first row , is demonstrated .",
    "it is assumed , that for a fixed @xmath50 a maximum exists in @xmath58 for a given @xmath59 . a parabolic fit of @xmath54 near @xmath59 helps to determine the position @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is maximal : @xmath62     from ( [ lap2 ] ) for different values of step - size @xmath50 .",
    "it should be noted , that there is no fixed value of @xmath50 , which uniquely may be used to determine all positions .",

    "the gray - level indicates the intensity values @xmath54 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . in fig [ fig2 ]",
    "recovered @xmath65 along the positive y - axis are compared for different q - values with the original height - values .",
    "obviously there is no unique optimum choice for q , which works for all positions simultaneously .",
    "the proposed simple local approach is not very effective , instead it generates drop outs as a result of an interference of varying texture scaling with the fixed step size q. for a realistic treatment of 3d - shape recovery a more sophisticated procedure is necessary .",
    "consequently a nonlocal approach , which weights the different contributions for a varying step size is a promising and well defined approach .",
    "indeed it will enhance the quality of the results significantly , as will be demonstrated in the next section .",
    "the generalized fractional approach extends the above presented local algorithm .",
    "the nonlocal modified laplacian according to ( [ gen ] ) is given by : @xmath66    therefore we obtain a well defined two step procedure .",
    "first , the local operator is applied , followed by the nonlocalization integral .    in the discrete case ,",
    "applying the nonlocal laplacian to every slide in a slide set , the first step is therefore identical with ( [ dloc ] ) and yields a set of intensity values @xmath54 at a given pixel - position at @xmath55 .",
    "an application of the discrete version of @xmath15 then leads to :    @xmath67    where we have introduced a cutoff @xmath68 , which limits the integral on the finite domain of pixel values .",
    "if we interpret the intensity values as constant function values at position @xmath55 with size @xmath47 , the integration may be performed fully analytically . in the appendix",
    "we have listed the resulting matrix - operator for @xmath69 .",
    "the resulting nonlocal intensities @xmath70 are presented in the lower row of fig .",
    "the nonlocal approach reduces the granularity of the local operator and a more smooth behaviour of intensities results .    since this is the only modification of the local approach , the recovery of the height information for every pixel is similar to ( [ locz ] )    @xmath71    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] results are plotted for different values of @xmath0 .     from ( [ genl3 ] ) for different values of the fractional parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the algorithm is very stable against a variation of @xmath0 . in the limit @xmath5 the nonlocal approach reduces to the local scenario .",
