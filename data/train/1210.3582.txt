    "we note that a scenario in which the wind velocity is not unique but has instead any value ( fast and/or slow outflow ) could possibly result in faster ejecta at large distances from the galaxy center and slower ones closer to the center , since the former would have had more time to travel out to large distances .",
    "the model presented here could mimic such a behaviour .",
    "we explore a further halo mass dependent parametrization of our new wind model in run rvwb (  [ sec - num - sim ] ) .",
    "observational studies of ultraluminous infrared galaxies at @xmath85 by @xcite detect a positive correlation of galactic outflow speed with galaxy mass .",
    "their figure 7 ( bottom panel ) shows that the outflow terminal velocities are always @xmath86 times larger than the galactic rotation speed .",
    "inspired by these results , we assume that the velocity @xmath74 is related to the circular velocity @xmath87 of the halo at the virial radius @xmath88 as : @xmath89 the halo mass @xmath90 and radius are related such that @xmath88 encloses a density @xmath91 times the mean density of the universe at the simulation redshift @xmath23 : @xmath92 here @xmath93 is the present critical density .",

    "firstly , an average inter - particle distance , @xmath97 , is calculated ; using the total mass , number of particles and the mean density . the linking length for the default on - the - fly fof in gadget-3 is @xmath98 , which is commonly used to find dark matter ( dm ) halos .",
    "however , sometimes the fof can link together dm substructures which actually belong to multiple galaxies with distinct stellar structures , into a single halo .",
    "therefore , the stellar components of the fof groups are considered to be more stable and thereby identified as galaxies .    in order to select galaxies , we obtain stellar groups by modifying the fof group finder as follows : we allow the fof to first link over stars as the primary particle type , and then link over ( gas + dm ) particles as the secondary type . to facilitate selection of stellar groups , which are generally smaller in size",

    "our preliminary tests indicate that the center - of - mass position of the fof groups are offset from the gas density peak location .",
    "hence we decide not to consider the center - of - mass positions but to record the position of the member gas particle with maximum sph density in each group : this maximum gas density location is considered as the group center .",
    "we tag in the code the group ( representing a galaxy ) and the group center each relevant gas particle belongs to .",
    "we define the galactocentric radius , @xmath1 , as the distance of each gas particle from its group center .    assuming that outflows are generated from mass loss during sf , the implementation of launching the wind involves a probabilistic criteria similar to spawning star particles , as described in sh03 .",
    "gas particles undergoing sf are stochastically selected and kicked into wind , by imparting an one - time @xmath53 boost .",
    "a probability is calculated in a timestep @xmath104 for each multiphase gas particle : @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the mass fraction of cold clouds and @xmath107 is the sf timescale , which depends on the parameters of the sf model . a random number is drawn in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] , and if it falls below @xmath108 then the particle is given a wind kick .",
    "if @xmath109 is particle velocity and @xmath110 its gravitational potential , then its velocity after receiving wind kick is updated to : @xmath111 the direction ( unit vector @xmath112 ) is set as a random orientation along @xmath113 , which makes the wind particles to be preferentially ejected along the rotation axis of the galaxy or perpendicular to the galaxy disk .    in order to enable the outflow to escape from dense sf regions without affecting the sf , a new wind particle ( gas particle just receiving a wind kick following eq .",

    "<S> we infer that the rvwb model is similar to the nw case , except that it substantially enriches the cgm : the carbon metallicity ( @xmath4 ) is @xmath5 times higher in rvwb than in nw at @xmath6 ; and the warm gas of @xmath7 k and @xmath8 is enriched at a level @xmath9 times higher than in nw . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that the impact of models cw and rvwa are similar , with the following notable differences . </S>",
    "<S> rvwa causes a greater suppression of star formation rate at @xmath10 , and has a higher fraction of low - density ( @xmath11 ) , warm - hot ( @xmath12 k ) gas than in cw . @xmath4 in the cw model increases monotonically with @xmath13 at @xmath14 , while in rvwa @xmath4 first decreases and then remains constant over the same density range . </S>",
    "<S> outflows in cw produce a higher and earlier enrichment of some igm phases than rvwa : the warm @xmath7 k , @xmath15 phase is enriched @xmath5 times more and at @xmath16 the underdense @xmath17 warm - hot @xmath18 k gas has already a median @xmath19 in cw . by visual inspection , we note that the rvwa model shows bipolar outflows and galactic disks more pronounced than in all the other wind models . </S>",
