    "old open clusters cover a large range of distances , metallicities , and ages ( friel 1995 ) , and that warrants their use in investigations of the chemical and dynamical evolution of our galaxy . to study the metallicity and age distribution of open clusters with galactocentric distance , and avoid unnecessary and dangerous biases , a key requisite is homogenous analysis of very accurate observational data , as discussed by , e.g , janes & phelps ( 1994 , jp94 ) carraro & chiosi ( 1994 , cc94 ) , friel ( 1995 ) , twarog et al .",
    "( 1997,taat97 ) .",
    "this is the fifth paper of a series dedicated to the examination of old open clusters of different ages and metallicities , and located at different galactic radii : for them we measure in a homogenous way distance , age , reddening and metallicity .",
    "these quantities are derived from comparison of the observed colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to synthetic ones generated by a numerical code based on stellar evolution tracks and taking into account theoretical and observational uncertainties ( tosi et al .",
    "these simulations are much more powerful than the classical isochrone fitting method to study the evolutionary status of the analysed region and have been successfully applied both to nearby irregular galaxies ( greggio et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) and to galactic open clusters ( ngc2243 : bonifazi et al . 1990 ; cr261 : gozzoli et al . 1996",

    "berkeley 21 ( be21 ) is located toward the galactic anticentre , at coordinates ra(1950 ) = 5:48:42 , dec(1950 ) = 21:46 , and l@xmath0 = 187@xmath1 , b@xmath0 = @xmath2 .",
    "it has already been observed by christian & janes ( 1979 , hereafter cj ) , but their photographic cmd is very shallow , barely reaching the main sequence turn - off ( to ) .",
    "they deduced a substantial reddening ( @xmath3 1.0 ) , a large distance modulus ( @xmath3 16 ) , and a quite young age ( @xmath4 yr ) .",
    "much better data have been presented by phelps et al .",
    "( 1994 , pjm94 ) in their compilation of old open clusters , providing = 13.9@xmath50.2 and an age of 2.8 gyr , derived on the basis of @xmath6=1.6 ( @xmath6 being the magnitude difference between to and clump stars , jp94 ) .",
    "the metallicity has been estimated by medium - resolution spectroscopy ( friel & janes 1993 , fj93 ) , but its actual value strongly depends on the adopted reddening (= 0.7@xmath50.2 , janes 1991 ) , with [ fe / h]= @xmath7 dex .",
    "this large uncertainty , given the fact that be21 defines the lowest metallicity limit of the open clusters sample and is one of the clusters most distant from the galactic centre , is a further limitation for studies of the ( possible ) age and distance relations with chemical abundance in the galactic disc ( see also twarog et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and data analysis ; in section 3 we present the derived cmds involving bvi photometry and discuss the presence of binary stars . in section 4",
    "we compare observed and synthetic cmds and derive metallicity , age , distance and reddening .",
    "finally , conclusions will be reviewed in section 5 .",
    ".log of the observations .",
    "the cluster field has its centre at ra(2000 ) = 5:51:46 , dec(2000 ) = + 21:48:45 .",
    "the off - cluster field has coordinates : ra(2000 ) = 5:52:08 , dec(2000 ) = + 21:53:53 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - mar ]",
    "although the fits of observed and simulated diagrams are not as satisfying for be21 as they have been for other systems examined with the same method , we have been able to determine a fairly consistent confidence interval for its distance , age , reddening and metallicity ( see table 5 ) by selecting the most reliable among the models described in the previous section .",
    "they place it among the old metal poor open clusters , in a region far from the galactic centre and of moderately high reddening .",
    "we have derived a distance slightly smaller than previous studies , while our evaluation of the reddening is fairly consistent with past works .",
    "no previous indication of differential reddening was given in the literature , but our data definitely show it .",
    "jp94 found , for the red clumps of 23 open clusters with @xmath81.0 ( i.e. older than about 1.5 gyr ) a mean absolute magnitude @xmath9 , and a mean intrinsic colour @xmath10 . in our case , these mean values , when applied to the observed @xmath11=16.80 and @xmath12=1.55 , would imply @xmath13=15.90 , and = 0.60 , or @xmath14=14.04 . from our best simulations , we obtain instead @xmath15 13.5 , = 0.76 , corresponding to @xmath13=15.86 .",
    "in other words , the clump - based distances seem to agree , but the colour of the clump stars seems to be quite different from the mean .",
    "part of this discrepancy may be due to the high reddening affecting be21 , whose differential effect on blue and red stars leads to an apparent shrink by 0.04 of the true colour difference between to and clump stars ( fernie 1963 , twarog 1998 private communication ) . on the other side , taat97 , derive a mean @xmath16 for ten clusters not too metal - rich ranging from ngc7789 to mel66 , i.e. approximately from 1 to 5 gyr , for which they try to measure the distance in a quite homogenous way .",
    "this translates , in our case , to @xmath13=16.2 ; since they do not cite a mean intrinsic @xmath17 no further comparison with our best choice for the reddening is possible .",
    "there are no completely reliable reddening determination for this cluster since the ubv data of cj do not reach the ms , but our determination and that by janes ( 1991 ) agree well .",
    "we have further compared our finding with what is expected from the spatial distribution of interstellar extinction near the galactic plane . to this end",
    "we have considered the studies of fitzgerald ( 1968 , fig .",
    "3h ) and neckel & klare ( 1980 , fig .",
    "6i ) . in both cases , a reasonable estimate deduced from their data for low galactic latitudes and the right",
    "longitude , is @xmath18 0.8 ; fitzgerald s ( 1968 ) observations also allow for a lower value , closer to 0.5 , but seem to exclude the high values , close to 1 , needed by the lower metallicity tracks of any group .",
    "janes ( 1991 ) and jpm94 give a distance modulus = 13.9@xmath50.2 , somewhat larger than our results for every set of tracks .",
    "carraro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , working on the same data , cite a galactocentric distance of 14.5 kpc , also implying a distance modulus @xmath313.9 .",
    "we have no good explanation for this difference , but we must emphasize that adopting = 13.9 we would be forced to select younger ages , and this would have two major drawbacks : a worse disagreement with literature ages ( see next ) , and a worse reproduction of the ms shape in the synthetic cmds .      also in the case of the age , we seem to have found a value lower than given in literature .",
    "we can explain the discrepancy partly by the different techniques adopted , partly by the better quality of our data .",
    "the various parameter combinations all converge to a fairly small range of possible ages ( 2.1 to 2.8 gyr , with favorite age around 2.2 gyr ) .",
    "in fact , the only largely discrepant value found in our analysis is for the franec98 z=0.01 tracks , a value in strong disagreement with the spectroscopically determined metallicity . despite the uncertainties involved in the age determination with our method",
    ", we consider it still more reliable than ages derived by other means",
    ".    nonetheless , it is not always feasible to determine the age of a cluster with the proper method of synthetic diagram fitting : to do so , high quality data , both deep and precise , are needed , and the process itself is complex . to apply this technique to all the objects of interest takes a long time , while the properties of the whole sample of open clusters are needed to study the disc population and evolution .",
    "for this reason , several parameterizations of cluster ages , based on a handful of well studied objects , have been proposed .",
    "these methods , if uncertain in absolute value for the single cluster , yield a reasonable age ranking for the cluster system .",
    "these parameterizations are usually based on a difference , in magnitude and/or in colour , between well recognizable points of the cmd ( usually the to and the red clump ) , as this is much easier to measure than any absolute quantity .",
    "note though that the precise definition of the two points , and especially of the to , changes among authors .",
    "we will cite here the three following examples : i ) anthony - twarog & twarog ( 1985 and later works ) use the magnitude difference between the red giant clump and _ the brightest point at the to _ ( @xmath19 ) coupled with the difference in colour between the red giant branch at the position of the clump and the bluest point of the to ( @xmath20 ) ; ii ) jp94 use a similar , but measured between the red clump and _ the inflection point between the ms to and the base of the giant branch _ ; iii ) cc94 define their @xmath21 as jp94 , but assume that _ the reference to luminosity is 0.25 mag fainter than observed in the cmd _ , to take into account the fact that presence of unresolved binaries tends to brighten the to region . in the case of be21 , we have : = 1.8 ( our measure ) , @xmath19=1.2 , ( jp94)=1.6 , @xmath21=1.55 .",
    "all these different definitions try to circumvent the problem that the to point is not always easily identified in open clusters , due to field stars and binaries contamination and/or paucity of stars .",
    "the strength of our kind of analysis is that we do not judge on the basis of the observed cmd alone : we know from the tracks the exact location of the to in each of our simulated cmds .",
    "given this , we have chosen to measure the magnitude difference as defined above at what we believe to be the true to , i.e. at the point corresponding to the hottest ms point in the evolutionary tracks .",
    "jp94 correlated  with cluster ages .",
    "the calibration of their morphological age index ( mai , expressed in gyr ) translates for be21 to an age of 2.8 gyr ( based upon = 1.6 , pjm94 ) , marginally inconsistent with what we get from the direct comparison with evolutionary tracks ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the age difference does not arise from any discrepancy in the two sets of data : we find = 1.8 , quite consistent with the value given by pjm94 considering that we measure it in a slightly different way .",
    "however , we have found in the past ( e.g. in the case of ngc2506 , marconi et al .",
    "1997 ) that the mai tends to overestimate ages .",
    "anthony - twarog & twarog ( 1985 , revised by twarog & anthony - twarog 1989 ) proposed the so called morphological age ratio ( mar ) , defined as mar = @xmath22 ( see above ) .",
    "this index is independent of reddening and almost independent of metallicity ( anthony - twarog & twarog 1985 , buonanno et al .",
    "the calibration of the relation between mar and ages has changed from : age = 1.4@xmath23mar gyr ( anthony - twarog & twarog 1985 ) to : age = 2.0@xmath23mar gyr ( twarog & anthony - twarog 1989 ) . applying their definition to our cmd",
    ", we find the values given in table 6 , and an age of about 2.7 to 3.9 gyr , depending on the adopted calibration . with no attempt to give a new calibration of the mar - age relation , simply adopting for the clusters we studied the parameters and ages in table 6 ,",
    "we find : age = 2.3 @xmath23 mar  2.6 ( @xmath24 = 0.9 ) .",
    "we did not include be17 in this computation : it represents an extreme of the interpolation and we felt that the parameters derived from the published diagrams were too insecure .",
    "this relation gives for be21 an age of 1.9 gyr .",
    "carraro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derive for be21 an age of 3.1 gyr , based on the pjm94 data and the synthetic cmd method using the padova tracks . the difference with our results , obtained employing the same sets of tracks ( although we do not interpolate in metallicity as they do ) , may perhaps be explained simply with the worse quality of the observational data they use .",
    "certainly , in no case are we able to reach self - consistently such a large age .",
    "we note that our method is unable to solve the problem of the cluster precise metal abundance .",
    "the comparison with evolutionary tracks can only give a coarse indication of metallicity .",
    "too many variables are present in tracks computation to discriminate metallicity to such an extent .",
    "in fact , tracks nominally closer to the metallicity derived for be21 from spectroscopic measurements ( [ fe / h]=0.97 , or z @xmath3 0.002 , fj93 ) appear less consistent with the observed cmd than tracks more metal rich , because of the large colour extent of the subgiant branch and , in some cases , of an excessively high reddening required to reproduce the observed colour of the ms .",
    "anyway , what can be said is that the best fits are obtained for the slightly more metal - rich combinations , i.e. for z=0.006 ( @xmath3 -0.5 ) or 0.004 ( @xmath3",
    "-0.7 ) as compared to 0.001 ( @xmath3 -1.3 ) . this would go in favour of a metal abundance slightly higher than measured by fj93 .",
    "there is the possibility that the fj93 scale may be underestimating cluster metallicities .",
    "taat97 compared it with abundances based on ddo photometry and found the fj93 values systematically low .",
    "another example may be the couple of clusters examined by gratton & contarini ( 1994 ) : they observed two giants in each cluster at high - resolution and high s / n ( r=30,000 , s / n @xmath3 100 ) and found for ngc2243 and mel66 the values [ fe / h]=0.48 and 0.38 respectively , to be compared with [ fe / h]=0.56 and 0.51 ( fj93 ) .",
    "fj93 emphasized the fact that the actual value derived for the cluster metallicity from their spectra is strongly dependent on the adopted reddening : the @xmath50.2 mag error on reddening in janes ( 1991 ) allows for a formal uncertainty of @xmath50.3 dex in metallicity .",
    "they also find marginal support for a  value on the higher side , hence for a metal abundance slightly higher than the [ fe / h]=0.97 they give .",
    "this goes in the same direction suggested by our comparisons , even if we do not find any convincing evidence for a larger reddening .",
    "finally , we have identified the four stars studied by fj93 ( n@xmath25 = 50 , 406 , 413 , 415a , which correspond to n@xmath26 = 50 , 67 , 20 , 51 respectively ) , to check if they may be influenced by the differential reddening we found ; but we consider it quite improbable , since all the four objects are within 1 arcmin from the centre of the cluster .",
    "no conclusive word can be said on be21 metallicity , which would instead be important to know with high precision , since it could represent the lowest value for the open clusters in our galaxy .",
    "a decisive answer would come from high resolution spectroscopy coupled with fine abundance analysis on the four stars examined by fj93 , already known to be cluster members .",
    "we warmly thank a. chieffi , m. limongi and , specially , o. straniero for having not only distributed the new franec tracks in advance of publication , but even in format suitable for our purposes .",
    "we also thank j.c .",
    "mermilliod for kindly making available his invaluable bda open clusters database and for useful comments .",
    "we are grateful to the referee ( bruce twarog ) for his comments , extremely useful both to improve the clarity of the paper and for future applications .",
    "the bulk of the numerical code for cmd simulations has been provided by laura greggio .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france ."
