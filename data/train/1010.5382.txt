    "we sometimes impose a _ peak - power constraint _ on the input , in which case we require that , with probability one , @xmath17 we then refer to @xmath18 as the maximal allowed power ( although , technically speaking , this needs to be normalized by the energy of each photon to have the sense of power . )    in the presence of feedback , the channel description is a bit more technical @xcite .",

    "we say that a bit can be transmitted reliably over our channel with average transmitted energy @xmath35 , if for any @xmath36 we can find some transmission interval @xmath37 and a coding / decoding rule of expected transmission energy @xmath35 and probability of error smaller than @xmath38 .",
    "we denote by @xmath39 the least energy required to transmit a bit reliably over our channel .",
    "the minimum energy required to send a single bit over the poisson channel with dark current @xmath5 , feedback , and no peak - power constraint is @xmath40 irrespective of the dark current .",
    "if the dark current is zero , then this is achievable even under a peak - power constraint whenever @xmath41 .",
    "the achievability when @xmath42 is straightforward . to send @xmath13",
    "we transmit the all - zero input ; to send @xmath14 we transmit @xmath18 until , through the feedback link , we learn that a count was registered ; thereafter we send zero .",
    "the decoder guesses `` @xmath13 '' if no counts were registered in the interval @xmath28 $ ] , and guesses `` @xmath14 '' otherwise .",
    "since @xmath42 , the probability of error given @xmath13 is zero . also , the transmitted energy when @xmath13 is zero , so @xmath43 .",
    "conditional on @xmath14 the time of the first count is exponential with mean @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , @xmath45 .",
    "conditional on @xmath14 , the probability of error is the probability that no counts are registered in the interval @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the probability of this event is the probability that the first count occurs after time @xmath37 , i.e. , the probability that a mean-@xmath44 exponential exceeds @xmath37 .",
    "it thus tends to zero as @xmath46 .    if @xmath47 and there is no peak - power constraint , we choose @xmath48 and @xmath49 and use the above scheme with @xmath50 .",
    "we make sure that @xmath51 is small enough for the probability of a spurious count in the interval @xmath52 $ ] to be very small ( the probability of a spurious count in this interval is @xmath53 ) , and we choose @xmath18 large enough so that the probability that a mean-@xmath44 exponential exceeds @xmath51 is also very small .",
    "to prove that @xmath39 can not be smaller than @xmath54 , it suffices to consider the case where @xmath42 .",
    "we thus assume @xmath42 . in this case",
    "there is no loss in optimality in assuming that to send @xmath13 we transmit the all - zero input .",
    "indeed , given any general scheme consider the guess the decoder produces when faced with no counts .",
    "call that false .",
    "let true be its complement .",
    "consider now a scheme with the same encoding rule for true , with the same decoding rule , but where we send the all - zero input to convey false .",
    "the new scheme uses less ( or same ) energy ; has the same @xmath55 ; and has @xmath56 .",
    "since the name we give to the hypotheses is immaterial , we can assume that false corresponds to @xmath13 .",
    "next we argue that there is no loss in optimality in restricting ourselves to a detector that bases its decision on the presence of counts in the interval @xmath28 $ ] . since this enlarges the set of outcomes yielding the guess `` d=1 '' , this can not increase @xmath57 . to send @xmath13 we send the all - zero waveform , which results in no counts ( there is no dark current ) , so this does not change @xmath58 .",
    "finally , we argue that there is no loss in optimality in stopping transmission once a count has been registered . indeed , this reduces the transmitted energy and does not change the performance of the above detector .",
    "we next analyze the probability of error of such schemes .",
    "conditional on @xmath13 , the probability of error is zero , because there is no dark current so sending zero input guarantees zero counts . as to the conditional probability of error given @xmath14 ,",
    "let @xmath59 denote the random time at which the first count is registered .",
    "substituting the stochastic process @xmath60 in yields @xmath61 } \\\\    & = { \\textnormal{\\textsf{e}}_{}\\!\\bigl[y(t_{1 } \\wedge { { \\textnormal{\\usefont{u}{eur}{m}{n}\\selectfont t } } } )    \\kern-0.1em \\bigm| \\kern-0.1em d=1\\bigr ] } \\\\    & = { \\textnormal{\\textsf{e}}_{}\\!\\biggl [ \\int_{0}^{\\infty } c(t ) { \\,\\textnormal{d}}y(t )    \\kern-0.1em \\biggm| \\kern-0.1em d=1\\biggr ] } \\\\    & = { \\textnormal{\\textsf{e}}_{}\\!\\left [ \\int_{0}^{\\infty } c(t ) x_{1}(t ) { \\,\\textnormal{d}}{t}\\right ] } \\\\    & = { \\textnormal{\\textsf{e}}_{}\\!\\left [ \\int_{0}^{t_{1 } \\wedge { { \\textnormal{\\usefont{u}{eur}{m}{n}\\selectfont t } } } } x_{1}(t ) { \\,\\textnormal{d}}{t}\\right ] } \\\\    & = { \\mathcal e}_{1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the probability of error to tend to zero , the expected energy transmitted to convey @xmath14 must thus approach @xmath10 .",
    "more generally , to send @xmath0 bits requires @xmath62 of the energy of a photon . when @xmath63 we recover the required energy to send one bit . to prove the converse  that one can not accomplish the task with less energy  requires a simple genie - aided argument .",
    "once again we can assume no dark current , and we can show that there is no loss in optimality in conveying the zero message using the all - zero input and by limiting ourselves to detectors that guess that the transmitted message was the zero message if , and only if , no counts were registered .",
    "we then consider a genie that , if a count is registered , tells the detector which message was sent . with the aid of the genie the detectors errs if , and only if , the transmitted message was not the zero message and no counts were registered .",
    "thus , by our previous analysis , the required energy of each of the nonzero messages must be one .",
    "averaging over the equally - likely messages demonstrates that @xmath64 of the energy of a photon is necessary for reliable transmission .",
    "the direct part in the absence of dark current is based on a simple scheme where the transmission interval @xmath65 is divided into @xmath66 intervals .",
    "we associate with the nonzero message  @xmath67 the interval @xmath68 to send the nonzero message  @xmath69 we transmit with a very high power starting at time  @xmath70 until a count is registered or until the end of the interval at time @xmath71 . to send the zero message we send the all - zero signal .",
    "the detector operates as follows . if no counts are registered , it guesses that the zeroth message was sent .",
    "if a count is registered , it declares that the transmitted message was the one that corresponds to the interval in which the count was registered .    in the presence of dark",
    "current we use the same scheme except that we choose as our transmission time a very short interval @xmath52 $ ] in which the probability of a spurious count is negligible .",
    "in the absence of a peak power constraint , the capacity of the poisson channel ( with or without feedback ) is infinite @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , in sending a very large number of bits , reliable communication can be had with an arbitrarily small expected energy per bit .",
    "the situation changes dramatically when sending a _ single _ bit . even in the presence of feedback ,",
    "the required energy is finite ; it is , in fact , @xmath54 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the infinite - bandwidth gaussian channel , where a single bit can be sent reliably with the same amount of energy that would be required per bit if one were sending a large number of bits @xcite , @xcite ."
