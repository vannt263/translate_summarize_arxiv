    "solis is a state - of - the art ground - based facility dedicated to the study of the sun and its magnetic atmosphere for decades to come .",
    "it consists of three instruments - the vector spectromagnetograph ( vsm ) , the integrated sunlight spectrometer ( iss ) , and the full - disk patrol ( fdp ) .",
    "an overview on each instrument can be found in keller , harvey , & giampapa ( 2003 ) .",
    "the vsm , in particular , operates from kitt peak since may 2004 . among other daily measurements ,",
    "the vsm performs complete stokes polarimetry at the fe i @xmath1 photospheric spectral line .",
    "an inversion of the stokes images provides full - disk vector magnetograms of the solar photosphere ( see henney , keller , & harvey , 2006 , for details ) .",
    "the vsm data are the first spectrographic full - disk vector magnetograms ever obtained .",
    "partial - disk vector magnetography is performed by a handful of ground - based instruments and , recently , by the spectro - polarimeter of the solar optical telescope ( sot ) on board the _ hinode _ satellite ( lites , elmore , & streander 2001 ) .",
    "_ hinode _ carries the first space - based vector magnetographs , while the first air - borne vector magnetograph was included in the flare genesis experiment balloon payload ( rust , 1994 ) .",
    "the first space - based full - disk vector magnetograms will be acquired by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; scherrer 2002 ) on board the imminent solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) . from the above series of groundbreaking developments",
    ", one feels that solar vector magnetography is probably entering its golden era .",
    "therefore , it is both essential and timely to address and efficiently solve the core problems associated with it in order to fully exploit the unprecedented existing and future vector magnetogram data .",
    "vector magnetic field measurements inferred by the zeeman effect suffer from an intrinsic azimuthal ambiguity in the orientation of the transverse magnetic field component ( harvey , 1969 ) .",
    "indeed , the properties of the transverse zeeman effect remain invariant under the transformation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the azimuth angle .",
    "the problem of the @xmath0-ambiguity has proved notoriously difficult to solve self - consistently , despite numerous attempts ( for an overview , see metcalf et al .",
    ", 2006 , and references therein ) . for full - disk magnetograms , an additional problem appears in case active regions should be studied .",
    "how are active regions to be extracted from the full - disk measurements ?",
    "this task may appear trivial if performed manually , but it is quite daunting in case voluminous data are to be processed .",
    "moreover , applications intimately related to active regions and their magnetic evolution such as , for example , magnetic helicity calculations or major flare forecasting , require a robust definition of active regions and their spatial extent .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss our proposed solutions to both active region identification and azimuth disambiguation .",
    "both techniques have been integrated into the vsm data pipeline and are operating in real time owing to the modest computational resources they require .",
    "their operation is smooth and their solutions are robust , and this holds promise for automatic application to future full- or partial - disk vector magnetogram data .",
    "our active - region identification method does not require vector magnetograms .",
    "it was conceived by b. j. labonte and was first applied by labonte , georgoulis , & rust ( 2007 ) to full - disk line - of - sight magnetograms of the michelson - doppler imager ( mdi - scherrer et al . , 1995 ) on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) .",
    "the technique consists of five steps , namely :    1 .",
    "smooth the full - disk line - of - sight magnetic field @xmath4 using a smoothing window with linear size equal to one supergranular diameter ( sgd ) , that is , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 on the solar surface . in the smoothed image ,",
    "( i ) test for bipolarity , enhancing magnetic polarity inversion lines , and ( ii ) calculate the gradient between the two polarities , emphasizing their e - w orientation . from this information ( smoothed image , bipolarity , orientation )",
    "create an intensity image with enhancements corresponding to the active regions present on the disk ( figure [ f1]a ) .",
    "2 .   coalign the intensity image with the actual magnetogram .",
    "identify magnetic flux concentrations that coincide with the image s enhancements and discard those with flux imbalance larger than a prescribed threshold .",
    "3 .   for each qualifying intensity enhancement , determine an intensity - weighted centroid ( barycenter ) .",
    "4 .   match the location of each centroid with noaa s space environment center ( sec ) archives to assign ar numbers to each centroid . for multiple numbers , choose the one with assigned location closest to the centroid .",
    "starting from each centroid , determine the spatial extent ( area ) of the respective active region .",
    "smoothing by 1 sgd provides a first clue of the existing active regions and their locations on the disk .",
    "the size of the smoothing window reflects the fact that supergranules are the fundamental convection cells responsible for the large - scale magnetic fields in the sun and , therefore , for active - region formation ( see , e.g. , leighton , noyes , & simon , 1962 ) .",
    "the flux imbalance criterion points to the fact that active regions are mainly closed magnetic field structures .",
    "nonetheless , the imbalance tolerance limit is an external variable and can be set at will .",
    "the dominant e - w orientation criterion helps avoid identifying accidental flux associations as active regions .",
    "the centroid calculation helps associate the identified flux concentrations with the standard noaa active - region number database .",
    "the remaining task is the determination of the spatial extent of each active region .",
    "this is accomplished in five steps , namely :    1 .",
    "draw two concentric circles around each centroid - an inner one with radius equal to 1 sgd and an outer one with radius equal to 6 sgd .",
    "2 .   define circles with increasing radii from 1 to 6 sgds and find the average value of @xmath7 on each perimeter .",
    "3 .   find the median of the average @xmath7-values between 5 and 6 sgds from the centroid .",
    "use this median as a @xmath8 threshold .",
    "4 .   check the perimeter averages of @xmath7 and stop at the circle where the average @xmath7 falls below @xmath9 , i.e. , becomes smaller than twice the above median .",
    "add 1 sgd to the radius of this circle and draw the square prescribed to this radius .",
    "this square will outline the edges of the identified active region ( figure [ f1]b ) .",
    "we underline that our size calculation technique , namely , defining an annulus with internal and external radius of 5 and 6 sgds , respectively , to define the @xmath8 threshold , precludes strong magnetic fields from being included in areas belonging to multiple active regions .",
    "indeed , notice the overlapping between the areas of noaa active regions ( ars ) 10786 and 10788 in figure [ f1]b .",
    "this common area _ does not _",
    "include strong magnetic fields .",
    "this stems from the fact that if the annulus cuts through strong magnetic flux accumulations , then the @xmath8 threshold will be higher and the average @xmath7 value will drop below @xmath9 at shorter distances from the centroid , thereby imposing a smaller spatial extent for the examined active region .",
    "we have run numerous tests with full - disk magnetograms to verify that the technique performs as expected in the vast majority of cases .",
    "our azimuth disambiguation method is the nonpotential magnetic field calculation ( npfc ) .",
    "the technique was introduced by georgoulis ( 2005 ) and was slightly refined ( npfc2 ) as discussed in metcalf et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in this work",
    ", it was tested against several other techniques and was found to reproduce successfully the correct azimuth solution in highly nonpotential , noise - free , synthetic vector magnetograms .",
    "moreover , it was among the fastest azimuth disambiguation techniques .",
    "in further comparisons , facilitated by a series of azimuth resolution workshops , the npfc2 method successfully reproduced the correct solution in nonpotential synthetic vector magnetograms where various levels of noise were embedded .",
    "overall , the npfc2 ( hereafter npfc ) method demonstrated its speed and efficiency even in cases with extreme noise levels , that eventually led to its integration to the vsm software package .",
    "the physics behind the npfc method is simple and starts by noticing that any magnetic field configuration @xmath10 can be decomposed into a current - free ( potential ) component @xmath11 and a current - carrying component @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 if the magnetic structure is rooted in a lower boundary plane @xmath14 and extends in the half - space above it , then @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be calculated on @xmath14 provided that the vertical ( normal to @xmath14 ) component @xmath15 of the magnetic field @xmath10 and the vertical component @xmath16 of the electric current density @xmath17 ( where @xmath17 is calculated by ampere s law ) , respectively , are known on @xmath14 . for @xmath11",
    "there are multiple calculation methods including green s functions ( schmidt , 1964 ) and fourier transforms ( alissandrakis , 1981 ) . for @xmath12 ,",
    "one utilizes the gauge conditions applying to @xmath14 , and especially the fact that @xmath12 has only an azimuthal component on @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "assuming that @xmath19 does not vary significantly with height on @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath20 , @xmath12 can be calculated in fourier space and then inverted into cartesian space , i.e. , @xmath21                  \\mathbf{\\hat{x } } +                  \\mathcal{f}^{-1 } [ { { -i k_x } \\over { k^2 } } \\mathcal{f } ( j_z ) ]                 \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\;\\;. \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) we have @xmath22 for the harmonic @xmath23 and @xmath24 , while @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the direct and inverse fourier transforms of @xmath27 , respectively , at @xmath23 . notice that the only assumption of the npfc method is @xmath20 .",
    "this assumption is quite reasonable because @xmath18 and , for small length elements , one might expect that @xmath28 slightly above @xmath14 , unless the magnetic field lines undergo dramatic changes of orientation within the elementary height .",
    "assuming that @xmath14 is the plane of the magnetic field measurements , an unambiguous magnetic field @xmath10 can be reconstructed on this plane from @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the problem , of course , is that both @xmath15 and @xmath16 , required to calculate @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , are subject to the @xmath0-ambiguity and are not known a priori .",
    "this is where the numerical part of the npfc method begins .",
    "figure [ f2 ] provides a graphical representation of the numerical process .",
    "initial - guess distributions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are used to calculate the initial - guess @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the total field @xmath10 is then reconstructed through equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the reconstructed field is compared to the two equally possible ambiguity solutions and is set equal to the solution that is closer to it , for each location of the measurements plane .",
    "this interim @xmath10-configuration gives rise to new @xmath15- and @xmath16-solutions . from them , new @xmath11- and @xmath12-configurations are produced , and the algorithm proceeds to a new iteration .",
    "convergence is judged by the number of strong - field vectors whose orientation changes from one iteration to the next . when no vectors ( or a small number of vectors ) are flipped for 10 consecutive iterations , the process stops and the latest reconstructed @xmath10-configuration is the suggested disambiguation solution .",
    "the entire calculation requires minimal computing resources and is completed in a matter of minutes , even at an ordinary desktop workstation .",
    "remarkably , the speed of the convergence does _ not _ depend on the complexity of the studied magnetogram but , rather , on its quality and linear size .",
    "in other words , the quality of the solution depends strongly on the quality of the measurements . to demonstrate this , we show in figure [ f3 ] a disambiguated vector magnetogram from _",
    "hinode s _ sot spectro - polarimeter that was inverted and kindly provided to us by b. w. lites .",
    "these data are of exceptionally high seeing - free quality and nearly unsurpassed spatial resolution ( @xmath29 per pixel ) .",
    "the depicted active region ( noaa ar 10930 ) shows a significant degree of complexity , especially along a strongly sheared magnetic polarity inversion line .",
    "the magnetogram s field of view had a very large linear size , namely , @xmath30 pixels . yet",
    "the npfc method required only @xmath31 and @xmath32 iterations to converge .",
    "the respective computing time for typical linear dimensions of , say , @xmath33 pixels , would not exceed @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ f4 ] provides the npfc disambiguation solutions for the active regions identified in the vsm magnetogram of figure [ f1 ] . inspecting figure [ f4 ]",
    ", one might notice some inconsistencies in the orientation of the horizontal magnetic field .",
    "these imperfections should be mostly attributed to problems in the inference of the vsm azimuth angle .",
    "indeed , the vsm measurements at the time of the observation ( 07/07/05 ) were still quite preliminary , with now - known issues not addressed in the data .",
    "the reason why we chose to show these data , nevertheless , is the high degree of activity in the solar atmosphere at the time of the observation .",
    "vector magnetograms obtained thereafter showed much less activity and fewer , simpler , active regions , although the inference of the azimuth angle was drastically improved . in the near future ,",
    "when solar activity will start stepping up toward the next maximum , the vsm will be fully equipped with sufficient hardware and software to reliably acquire and process massive amounts of data .",
    "although vsm full - disk vector magnetograms at the fe i @xmath1 photospheric line are obtained since august 2003 , these data have not yet been released to the solar and space physics communities .",
    "this is due to work currently underway on the last remaining issues that , however , must be addressed prior to releasing any digital data .",
    "this being said , we are confident that the data will be available for unrestricted use very soon .",
    "complete descriptions of vsm and its data archive can be found at + ` ttp://solis.nso.edu / solis_data.`tml . among other information ,",
    "this web page includes quick - look visualizations of both the latest vsm vector magnetograms and the regularly updated list of the vsm vector magnetogram data archive . featuring a user - friendly interface",
    ", one may view all the magnetic field components for each identified active region , together with the zenith and azimuth angles of the disambiguated magnetic field vector . upon the release of the vsm data",
    ", full milne - eddington inversion products will be available nearly 24 hours after the quick - look data acquisition ( henney , keller , & harvey , 2006 ) .",
    "as for the active - region identification and azimuth disambiguation techniques , this article demonstrates that they are general enough to be applied to both existing and future vector magnetograms , either in conjunction or independently .",
    "partial - disk magnetograms ( e.g. , from _ hinode _ ) might be disambiguated using the npfc method , while future sdo / hmi full - disk magnetograms might undergo a process similar to that described in  2 for the solis / vsm data .",
