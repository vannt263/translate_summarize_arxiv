    "the description of the internal structure of the nucleon is fairly well understood in terms of transverse momentum integrated distribution functions in contrast to the unintegrated ones . within the formalism",
    "the latter provide access to the transverse spin of quarks and moreover , they are sensitive to the average gluon field in the nucleon which can be measured in single spin asymmetries ( ssa s ) . following the approach and notations of ref .",
    "@xcite , we will try to understand how these distribution functions are defined in the parton model , where it is assumed that partons in the nucleon are soft .    in semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) , see fig.[processes ] , the virtual photon couples to the current sandwiched between the in- and outgoing hadrons .",
    "the cross - section is proportional to the leptonic tensor , @xmath0 , contracted with the hadronic tensor , @xmath1 .",
    "assuming factorization one can show that in the parton model the virtual photon actually scatters off a quark for which one of the leading contributions in @xmath2 is given in fig.[processes ] .",
    "other contributions at this order involve longitudinally polarized gluons and gluon fields at infinity .",
    "both contributions are needed for a color gauge invariant description , but we will discard them for the moment .",

    "show that the processes factorize into a hard and a universal soft part ( the non - perturbative information ) .",
    "in such proofs infrared divergences , appearing at higher order in the coupling constant , have to be absorbed in the soft parts in a universal manner  @xcite .",
    "recently this topic received a lot of attention  @xcite .",
    "interesting effects occur when considering @xmath5 corrections in sidis and dy .",
    "it was shown that closed gauge links , @xmath6}$ ] , in distribution matrix elements of a considered nucleon can only appear if there are _ other _ incoming _ and _ outgoing qcd ( bound ) states  @xcite .",
    "therefore , such wilson loops do not appear in the nucleon in sidis because in that case there are , besides the nucleon , only outgoing qcd states even when gluon bremsstrahlung is considered . as a result",
    ", the link still runs via plus infinity ( see fig.[fig2]a ) .",
    "supported by a first order calculation , the link very likely runs via plus infinity for the vertex correction and the self energy of the quark as well .",
    "however , gluon bremsstrahlung in dy , where there are incoming hadrons , creates outgoing qcd states . in that case",
    "the link turns out to depend on the number of gluons radiated ( see fig.[fig2]b , c ) . for the vertex and self energy correction alone , the link probably still runs via minus infinity .    if the difference of gauge links matters ( e.g. nonzero sivers function )",
    ", then the behavior of links under gluon radiation may imply that the evolution of distribution functions in dy is not the same as in sidis .",
    "this questions the universality of these functions .",
    "moreover , to prove factorization one has to absorb the infrared divergence in fig.[fig2]d into the upper blob .",
    "since the radiated gluon also affects the link of the lower blob , it will be difficult - if not impossible - to factorize such diagrams .    at this moment",
    "it is unclear whether transverse momentum dependent effects in dy can be factorized . in @xmath7 annihilation , where hadrons are only in the final state and therefore gauge links",
    "do not change under gluon radiation , such a factorization proof does exist  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the incorporation of gauge links will be an essential ingredient in considerations on factorization ."
