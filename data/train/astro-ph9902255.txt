    "assessing the quantity of dust in spiral galaxies is of primary importance in both understanding the intrinsic properties of galaxies themselves and interpreting observations of the distant universe : large quantities of dust can modify the optical appearance of galactic structures like spiral arms ( trewhella @xcite ) ; if the distribution of dust is extended , a large fraction of the radiation from the distant universe can be blocked ( ostriker & heisler @xcite ) ; star formation as determined from uv fluxes could be severely underestimated thus altering our knowledge of the star formation history of the universe ( hughes et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "dust mass can be retrieved from extinction or from emission in the fir . in the former case information about the star - dust relative geometry",
    "is needed and the method can only be applied to nearby edge - on galaxies , where the dust distribution can be inferred from extinction features ( xilouris et al .  ) . in the latter case",
    "there are no such limitations , and the wealth of data in the fir and sub - mm from instruments like the sub - mm camera scuba and from the satellites iso and cobe , can be used to measure dust mass .",
    "unfortunately , the determination of dust mass is entangled with that of dust temperature and they both rely on knowledge of the dust emissivity ( hildebrand  @xcite ) , the form of which is currently highly uncertain .    the emissivity ( or emission efficiency , i.e. the ratio between the emission cross section and the geometric cross section ) , @xmath0 is usually described by a function of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the value of the emissivity at the reference wavelength @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the wavelength dependence index .    while a value @xmath5 seems to be plausible for @xmath6@xmath7 m ( hildebrand  @xcite ; rowan - robinson  @xcite ) , there is observational evidence for a steeper emissivity at longer wavelengths .",
    "the difference in emissivity is not unexpected , since emission in the mid - infrared ( 25 - 60 @xmath7 m ) is dominated by transiently heated grains , while at @xmath8 grains emit at thermal equilibrium ( whittet  @xcite ) .",
    "sub - mm observations of spiral galaxies ( bianchi et al .",
    "@xcite ; alton et al .",
    "@xcite ) show that it is not possible to use an emissivity with @xmath5 to fit the 450 and 850 @xmath7 m emission .",
    "reach et al .",
    "( @xcite ) came to a similar conclusion .",
    "they used the spectrum of the galactic plane observed by the spectrophotometer firas on board the satellite cobe , to find that the data are well fitted by an emissivity : @xmath9^{1/6 } } , \\label{turning}\\ ] ] for the range 100 @xmath7 m to 1 cm .",

    "( @xcite ) find @xmath17 for amorphous silicate grains at a temperature of 20  k.    a value for the emissivity at a specific wavelength @xmath2 normalised to the extinction efficiency in the optical can be determined by carrying out an energy balance in a reflection nebula , comparing the energy absorbed from the central star with the fir output from the surrounding dust .",
    "alternatively , the extinction measured toward the star can be directly compared to the optical depth in the fir ( whitcomb et al .",
    "@xcite ; hildebrand  @xcite ; casey  @xcite ) .",
    "these methods are complicated by the unknown nebular geometry and by temperature gradients in the dust ; as an example , casey ( @xcite ) found that the extinction method usually retrieves higher values than the energy balance .",
    "in this paper we use the extinction method comparing the galactic extinction to fir emission : in this case the same column density of dust is responsible both for emission and extinction and a reliable result can be obtained .",
    "schlegel et al .  ( @xcite ; hereafter sfd ) have presented a new map of galactic extinction . after removing emission from zodiacal light and a cosmic infrared background ,",
    "they have combined the 100 @xmath7 m map of galactic emission taken by the dirbe experiment on board the cobe satellite with the 100 @xmath7 m large - area issa map from satellite iras , to produce a map of galactic emission with the quality calibration of dirbe and the high resolution of iras .",
    "the dust temperature has been retrieved using the dirbe maps at 100 @xmath7 m and 240 @xmath7 m assuming @xmath4=2 .",
    "knowing the temperature , the 100 @xmath7 m map has been converted into a dust column density map and subsequently calibrated to e(b - v ) using colours and mg@xmath18-index of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we would like to stress that the colour excess has been derived from the 100 @xmath7 m emission without any assumption about the value of the emissivity at any wavelength .",
    "moreover , the choice of @xmath4 does not affect significantly their results : when @xmath4=1.5 is used , the dust column density map varies only of 1% , aside from an overall multiplicative factor that is taken account of when calibrating with the colour excess .",
    "we have accessed the electronic distribution of this remarkable dataset to retrieve the 9.5@xmath19/pixel maps of the intensity at 100 @xmath7 m , i(100 @xmath7 m ) , the temperature and the colour excess e(b - v ) for the north and south galactic hemispheres .    when the same dust grains are responsible for emission and extinction , the ratio between the extinction coefficient in the v - band and the emissivity at 100 @xmath7 m is equivalent to the ratio of the optical depths @xmath20 the above formula is correct if all of the dust grains are identical . in a mixture of grains of different sizes and materials ,",

    "( 22 ) in sfd . as pointed out by the referee ,",
    "an estimate for @xmath30 can be easily derived from that equation , if the dirbe colour corrections factors , slowly depending on t , are omitted . following this way we obtained a value of 765.5 .",
    "sfd give an error of 8% for @xmath29 and this is the value quoted here . since most ( @xmath31 90% ) of the elliptical galaxies used to calibrate colour excess maps have galactic latitude @xmath32 , one may argue that the measured value is characteristic only of high latitude dust .",
    "reach et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find that the emissivity ( eq .  [ turning ] ) is best determined by fitting the firas spectrum on the galactic plane .",
    "they say that high latitude data have a smaller signal - to - noise ratio and can be fitted satisfactory with @xmath12 ( eq .  [ single ] ) although the same emissivity as on the plane can not be excluded . under the hypothesis that the same kind of dust is responsible for the diffuse emission in the whole galaxy",
    ", we have corrected sfd temperatures using reach et al .",
    "emissivity ( eq .  [ turning ] ) .",
    "the new temperatures are a few degrees higher than those measured with @xmath12 ( as an example we pass from a mean value of 18k in a 20@xmath33 diameter regions around the north pole to a new estimate of 21k[newtemp ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the difference between the two estimates of temperature is of the same order as the difference between the temperatures of warm dust at high and low galactic latitude in reach et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and this may only be a result of the different emissivity used to retrieve the temperature .",
    "when the correction is applied @xmath34 the new ratio is about three times higher , and this is a reflection of the change of temperature in the black body emission in ( [ taufir ] ) : for a higher temperature , a lower emissivity in the fir is required to produce the same emission .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath35 are thus greatly affected by assumptions about the emissivity spectral behaviour .",
