    "one of the main questions in statistical mechanics is to characterize nonequilibrium stationary states in terms of dynamical ensembles ( cf .",
    "e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . recently , for thermostated or open systems , stationary nonequilibrium ensembles were found to be related to the so - called sinai - ruelle - bowen ( srb ) measures @xcite , which had been investigated in dynamical systems theory @xcite . in the thermostated systems",
    "@xcite , a fictitious damping force mimicking a heat reservoir is introduced to avoid an uncontrolled growth of the kinetic energy due to an external driving force .",
    "the damping force is chosen so as to make the dynamics dissipative while it preserves time - reversibility . as a result of the dissipation",
    ", there exists an attractor of information dimension less than the dimension of phase space and the nonequilibrium stationary state is described by an asymptotic measure , which is an srb measure .",
    "the srb measure fully characterizes the transport properties , such as the transport law , transport coefficients and their fluctuations .",
    "for example , for the driven thermostated lorentz gas @xcite , the conductivity tensor was calculated , and ohm s law and einstein s relation were verified by comparing the averaged current with respect to the srb measure to the external electric field . on the other hand ,",
    "open chaotic hamiltonian systems with a flux boundary condition @xcite admit a nonequilibrium stationary state obeying fick s law that is described by a kind of srb measure .",
    "this measure again characterizes the transport properties .",
    "moreover , an open hamiltonian system with an absorbing boundary condition has a fractal repeller , that controls the chaotic scattering @xcite",
    ". the unstable manifold of the fractal repeller supports a conditionally invariant measure , which provides the long time limits of averaged dynamical functions @xcite .",
    "the interrelation between the thermostated systems approach and the open systems approach has been discussed by breymann , tl and vollmer @xcite . in this article , we present an analytical construction of srb measures for three examples of baker - type maps , which illustrate some aspects of the thermostated and/or open systems mentioned above .",
    "now we start with the general arguments on the srb measure .",
    "the long - term behavior of a dynamical system is characterized by an invariant measure @xmath1 on an invariant set @xmath2 , which describes how frequently various parts of @xmath2 are visited by a given orbit @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 the time ) .",
    "the invariant measure is said to be ergodic if it can not be decomposed into different invariant measures .",
    "such an ergodic invariant measure @xmath1 satisfies the ergodic theorem @xcite . in case of a map",
    "@xmath5 , it asserts that , for any continuous function @xmath6 , we have    @xmath7    a dynamical system typically admits uncountably many distinct ergodic measures and not all of them are physically observable .",
    "one criterion of choosing a physical measure @xmath1 is that @xmath1 describes the time averages of observables on motions with initial data @xmath8 randomly sampled with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath9 @xcite :    @xmath10    sinai , ruelle and bowen showed that a class of dynamical systems , called axiom - a systems , uniquely admit such a physical invariant measure ( srb measure ) @xcite .",
    "thus an srb measure is one for which the ergodic theorem is true for almost every point , @xmath8 , with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath11    axiom - a systems are characterized by the hyperbolic structure , i.e. , the existence of exponentially stable and exponentially unstable directions which intersect transversally with each other . in case of bijective differentiable maps ( i.e. , diffeomorphisms ) , the hyperbolic structure is defined as follows : consider a given orbit @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and small deviations @xmath14 of the initial value @xmath8 .",
    "note that there are @xmath15 independent possible directions of @xmath14 when the phase space dimension is @xmath15 .",
    "assume that the deviations along @xmath16 directions decrease more rapidly than an expontial function @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and that the deviations along the other @xmath20 directions grow more rapidly than an exponential function @xmath21 ( @xmath19 and the same @xmath22 ) .",
    "an invariant set @xmath23 is said to be hyperbolic when 1 )  for any @xmath24 , the orbit @xmath12 has the @xmath16 stable and @xmath20 unstable directions as explained above , 2 )  the stable and unstable directions depend continuously on @xmath8 and 3 )  the stable and unstable directions for the point @xmath8 are mapped by @xmath25 to the corresponding directions for the point @xmath12 .",
    "a point @xmath8 is said to be nonwandering if the orbit @xmath12 returns indefinitely often to any neighborhood of its initial point @xmath8 .",
    "if the set @xmath26 of all nonwandering points is hyperbolic and the set of periodic points is dense in @xmath26 , @xmath5 is called an axiom - a diffeomorphism . in particular , if the whole phase space @xmath27 is hyperbolic , @xmath5 is called an anosov diffeomorphism .",
    "the arnold cat map is an example of an anosov diffeomorphism .",
    "invariant measures that are smooth along the unstable directions are called srb measures .",
    "sinai , ruelle and bowen showed that , for axiom - a diffeomorphisms , the srb measure is the unique physical measure @xmath1 describing the time averages ( [ 1.2 ] ) of observables of motion with initial data @xmath8 taken at random with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath9 @xcite . for more details on axiom - a systems and srb measures ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in gibbs picture of statistical mechanics , a macroscopic state for an isolated system is described by a phase - space distribution function , and a macroscopic observable by an averaged dynamical function with respect to the distribution .",
    "suppose that the dynamics satisfies the mixing condition with respect to the microcanonical distribution @xmath28 :    @xmath29    where @xmath27 stands for the whole phase space , @xmath6 is a continuous dynamical function and @xmath30 is a normalized initial distribution function .",
    "then , the system exhibits time evolution as expected from statistical thermodynamics .",
    "namely , the distribution function weakly approaches an equilibrium microcanonical distribution and the averaged dynamical functions approach well defined equilibrium values @xcite .",
    "from this point of view , instead of eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) , it is enough to consider the following condition as a criterion of choosing a physical measure @xmath1 :    @xmath31    where @xmath9 stands for the lebesgue measure , @xmath27 is the whole phase space , @xmath2 the attractor and @xmath6 and @xmath30 are respectively a continuous dynamical function and a normalized initial distribution function .",
    "sinai , ruelle and bowen @xcite showed that the srb measures for the axiom - a systems satisfy eq .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) as well .",
    "hence , the measure satisfying eq .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) will be refered to as a physical measure . since the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) is the average @xmath32 of @xmath33 at time @xmath4 , eq .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) can be generalized to define a physical measure @xmath1 for systems with escape @xcite    @xmath34    where @xmath35 stands for the characteristic function of the phase space @xmath27 and @xmath36 is the support of @xmath1 .",
    "the denominator of the middle expression is necessary as the total probability is not preserved . when there is no escape , the physical measure defined by eq .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) is supported by the attractor and , thus , is invariant . on the other hand , when there is escape , the physical measure defined by eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) is , in general , not an invariant measure .",
    "however , since the ratio @xmath37 does not evolve in time , such a measure is called conditionally invariant @xcite .",
    "we remark that , when they are of axiom - a type , the systems with escape also possess `` natural '' invariant measures supported by the fractal repeller , which are specified e.g. , by a variational principle@xcite .",
    "it is the natural invariant measure that characterizes the ergodic properties such as the lyapunov exponents , but not the conditionally invariant physical measure defined by eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) .",
    "now we revisit thermostated and open systems . as explained before ,",
    "a thermostated system is dissipative because of the fictitious damping force .",
    "then , a nonequilibrium stationary state is described by an asymptotic srb measure defined by eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) @xcite . for open chaotic hamiltonian systems with a flux boundary condition ,",
    "a nonequilibrium stationary state obeying fick s law is described by a measure with a fractal structure along the contracting direction @xcite . since the measure is smooth along the expanding direction and can be defined by eq .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) , it is an srb measure@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "those srb measures fully characterize the transport properties .",
    "however , it should be noticed that the two cases are different because the invariant set of an open system is a fractal repeller which is fractal in both the stable and unstable directions and , thus , does not support an srb measure , while the invariant set of a thermostated system is an attractor which does support an srb measure .    by applying eq .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) for an initial constant density , one obtains a method of constructing an srb measure for a map @xcite : 1 )  approximate the measure by iterating an initial constant density finite times , 2 ) calculate the average with its result and 3 )  take the limit of infinite iterations .",
    "several methods are also proposed where unstable periodic orbits or trajectory segments are used to write down an srb measure and averages with respect to it ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . however , it is not easy to evaluate the convergence rate of the limits in eqs .",
    "( [ 1.4])-([1.5 ] ) , particularly for non - expanding maps , and to extract exponentially decaying terms from an averaged dynamical function @xmath38 , which are the pollicott - ruelle resonances@xcite .",
    "one of the reasons is that the long - time limit of the measure can be defined only via the ensemble average as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) and ( [ 1.5 ] ) . for non - expanding maps ,",
    "the distribution function itself does not have a well - defined long - time limit .",
    "in other words , an asymptotic srb measure is the _ weak _ limit of an initial measure . in an analytical construction of srb measures which we shall explain for three baker - type maps ,",
    "the weak convergence of measures is converted to the usual convergence ( technically speaking , the _ strong _ convergence ) of partially integrated distribution functions .",
    "contrary to the evolution equation of a distribution function ( the frobenius - perron equation ) , the evolution equation of a partially integrated distribution is contractive and possesses a well - defined long - time limit .",
    "this equation is similar to de rham s functional equation @xcite , which was introduced to deal with singular functions such as continuous functions with zero derivatives almost everywhere , and its contraction rate gives the convergence rate of the averaged dynamical function @xmath39 . in sec .",
    "ii , we review some properties of singular functions including those of de rham s functional equation . in sec .",
    "iii , an srb measure is constructed for a non - conservative reversible baker map with the aid of de rham s equation .",
    "the model illustrates the two fundamental features of the thermostated systems , namely the phase space contraction and time reversibility , and we discuss the interrelation between the two features . in sec .",
    "iv , a baker map with a cantor - like invariant set is studied . when there is no escape , the map possesses a strange attractor , which is a direct product of the unit interval and a cantor set . on the other hand ,",
    "when there is escape , the map has an invariant set , which is the direct product of two cantor sets , and is a simple example of an open system with an absorbing boundary condition .",
    "physical measures for the map with and without escape are constructed with the aid of de rham s equation and the natural invariant measure for the map with escape is derived . in sec .",
    "v , we investigate the properties of a baker map with a flux boundary condition , which mimics a chemical - reaction dynamics with a flux boundary condition ( cf . ref .",
    "we show that an srb - type stationary distribution describes the reaction dynamics and that the slowest relaxation to it is characterized by a decay mode ( i.e. , the pollicott - ruelle resonance ) , which is a conditionally invariant measure .",
    "vi is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "technical details of the construction of measures are presented in appendixes .",
    "basic tools of our analytical construction of srb measures are singular functions and de rham s functional equation .",
    "singular functions such as the weierstrass function or the takagi function were originally introduced as pathological counter examples to the intuitive picture of functions .",
    "these singular functions play an important role in chaotic dynamics . a step towards the analytical treatment of singular functions",
    "was given by de rham @xcite , who showed many of them can be characterized as a unique fixed point of a contraction mapping in a space of functions . in this section",
    ", we briefly review the properties of some singular functions and the relation between them and chaotic dynamical systems ( cf .",
    "refs.@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the first example of a nowhere differentiable continuous function was given by weierstrass in 1872 @xcite ( fig .",

    "moser @xcite used the weierstrass function to construct a nowhere differentiable torus for an analytic anosov system .",
    "yamaguti and hata @xcite used it as a generating function of orbits for the logistic map and discussed some generalizations .",
    "also weierstrass functions are eigenfunctions of the frobenius - perron operator for the renyi map @xmath44 ( mod 1 ) with @xmath45 a positive integer @xcite .    in 1903 , takagi gave a simpler example of a nowhere differentiable continuous function @xcite ( fig .",

    "( [ 2.2 ] ) by replacing @xmath50 to @xmath51 @xcite . in 1957 , the takagi function was rediscovered by de rham @xcite .",

    "the function @xmath52 is the eigenfunction of the frobenius - perron operator for the map @xmath53 ( mod 1 ) with eigenvalue 1/2 .",
    "also , the takagi function and related functions were found to describe the nonequilibrium stationary state obeying fick s law for the multi - baker map @xcite .    in the theory of the lebesgue",
    "integral , there appear nonconstant functions with zero derivatives almost everywhere , which are sometimes referred to as lebesgue s singular functions @xcite .",
    "one typical example is the cantor function ( fig .",

    "the eigenfunctionals of the frobenius - perron operator for the multi - bernoulli map and the multi - baker map can be represented as the riemann - stieltjes integrals with respect to @xmath54 with complex @xmath58 @xcite . in ref.@xcite , it was shown that , for a class of piecewise linear maps , the left eigenfunctionals of the frobenius - perron operator admit a representation in terms of singular functions similar to @xmath54 . as pointed out by hata and yamaguti @xcite , @xmath54 is analytic with respect to the parameter @xmath58 though it is a singular function of @xmath8 , and there exists an interesting relation between the parameter derivative of @xmath54 and the takagi function :    @xmath59    in 1957 , de rham found that the weierstrass function , the takagi function and lebesgue s singular function as well as other singular functions are fully characterized as a unique solution @xmath60 of a functional equation    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is a given function and @xmath63 is a contraction mapping with @xmath64 defined in the space of bounded functions on the unit interval [ 0,1 ] @xcite .",

    "since the formula for the integration by parts    @xmath89    holds in general , the riemann - stieltjes integral of a function of bounded variation with respect to a continuous function can be defined as above . at first sight , the evaluation of the riemann - stieltjes integral ( [ 2.6 ] ) seems to be difficult .",
    "but , for a class of functions obeying de rham s equation , it is not the case . as an example , consider the fourier - laplace transformation of @xmath54 :    @xmath90    by dividing the integral into the ones over [ 0,1/2 ] and [ 1/2,1 ] and changing the variable @xmath8 to @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively , we have the recursion relation    @xmath93    where the de rham equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) is used in the second equality . because @xmath94 , the above recursion relation gives @xcite    @xmath95    note that , for @xmath96 , @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) and , hence , the fourier - laplace transformation of @xmath99 does not satisfy the riemann - lebesgue lemma : @xmath100 , that again implies the singular nature of @xmath99 .",
    "further we notice that the formula ( [ 2.7 ] ) and the hata - yamaguti relation ( [ yamag ] ) relate the lebesgue s singular function and the takagi function to the weierstrass functions :    @xmath101    where the sums runs over positive odd integers , @xmath102 is the weierstrass function ( [ 2.1 ] ) and @xmath103 is a singular function obtained from ( [ 2.1 ] ) by replacing @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "in thermostated systems , dynamics is non - conservative due to the damping force mimicking a heat reservoir and thus , the forward time evolution is different from the backward time evolution .",

    "iii and iv , we have encountered different types of contracting dynamics that lead to invariant states all of which have singular measures supported on fractal sets . in the first case we considered a non - conservative reversible baker map on the unit square which globally preserves the area of the square but forms an attractor - repeller pair due to the local contraction and expansion properties of the map .",

    "if we add the possibility of escape , then the invariant set is fractal in both @xmath8 and @xmath49 directions .",
    "0.7 truecm    \\b ) it is worth mentioning that one can convert a physical measure for a system with escape to the proper invariant measure on the repeller by incorporating into the averaging process described in eq .",

    "such a procedure was used by van beijeren and dorfman in order to correctly compute the lyapunov exponents on the repeller for a lorentz gas @xcite .",
    "this procedure is closely related to one described by hunt , ott , and yorke @xcite to obtain natural measures on invariant sets .",
    "0.7 truecm    \\c )   we have encountered three different physical measures , which are characterized by the smoothness along the expanding direction . for closed non - conservative systems , the physical measures are singular and invariant . for an open system under an absorbing boundary condition ,",
    "the physical measure is singular and conditionally invariant . and for an open system under a flux boundary condition , the physical measure is invariant , but absolutely continuous with respect to the two - dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "it is only weakly singular in the sense that the density is discontinuous on a cantor - like set .",
    "it is interesting to note that the conditionally invariant measures appear as the decay modes ( i.e. , the pollicott - ruelle resonances ) for an open system under a flux boundary condition .",
    "such a relation exists more generally .",

    "on the other hand , in our construction of an srb measure , a functional equation for the partially integrated distribution function similar to the de rham equation is derived from the evolution equation for measures .",
    "note that the functional equation is a direct consequence of the self - similarity of the measure .",
    "an iterative method of solving the functional equation is similar to the procedure explained above .",
    "however , our method has some advantages .",
    "firstly , the de rham - type functional equations are fixed point equations for contraction mappings and , as a result , the iterative solution strongly converges to the limit . on the contrary",
    ", the iterative approximation of the density function does not converge by itself .",
    "therefore , one can obtain a good approximation to the cumulative distribution function of the srb measure by less iterations than by the conventional method .",
    "secondly , in the functional equation approach , one can systematically extract exponentially decaying terms which are typically higher order derivatives of singular functions in the sense of schwartz distributions .",
    "thirdly , although the measure is defined as the solution of a functional equation , the average values of certain dynamical functions can be calculated analytically as illustrated in sec .",
    "so far , the functional equation method was mainly applied to piecewise linear one - dimensional maps and baker - type maps @xcite , but we believe that the method can also be applied to other systems if the expanding and contracting directions can be well - separated .",
