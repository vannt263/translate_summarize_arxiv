    "an ever increasing body of evidence supports the existence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) as the major contribution to the matter budget of the universe . on the largest scale ,",
    "cosmological measurements @xcite tightly constrain the cdm relic density whereas on a local scale , the discrepancy between the rotation curves of spiral galaxies , as measured by 21 cm observations , and the ones that would be inferred from the luminous matter , indicates that spiral galaxies , including the milky way , should be embedded in a dark matter halo  @xcite . +",
    "directional detection of galactic dark matter has been proposed as a powerful tool to identify genuine wimp events as such @xcite .",
    "indeed , one expects a clear asymmetry in the angular distribution of wimp - induced events in the direction of motion of the solar system , which happens to be roughly in the direction of the constellation cygnus .",
    "as the background distribution is expected to be isotropic in the galactic restframe , one expects a clear and unambiguous difference between the wimp - induced signal and the background one .",
    "recent studies have shown that , within the framework of dedicated statistical data analysis , a low exposure directional detector could lead either to a high significance discovery of galactic dark matter @xcite or to a competitive exclusion @xcite .",
    "+ non - directional direct detection of dark matter is entering in a new era as several detectors are starting to exclude the upper part of the predicted supersymmetric parameter space , either in the spin - independent channel @xcite or in the spin - dependent one @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "forthcoming directional detection projects are designed to claim a proof of discovery .",
    "both approaches require a dedicated statistical treatment , taking into account systematics related to detector performance as well as astrophysical uncertainties .",
    "following @xcite , we use a profile likelihood ratio test statistic to assess the discovery potential of directional detection . + we give a complete overview of the effect of the main experimental issues on the discovery potential of directional detection of dark matter .",
    "our aim is to establish a weighted wish list that could be used when trying to optimize the design of a dark matter directional detection experiment .",
    "the experimental issues considered hereafter are : the background contamination , the energy threshold , the sense recognition efficiency , the angular resolution , the energy resolution and the background modeling . with a profile likelihood method",
    ", we estimate the sensitivity of a given directional experiment by taking into account the most relevant astrophysical uncertainties , _",
    "e.g. _ the local dark matter density , the wimp velocity distribution and the velocity of the solar system orbit .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : framework ] presents a brief introduction of directional dark matter detection , both from an experimental point of view and from a theoretical one .",
    "section  [ sec : profile ] introduces the definition of the likelihood function we have used , as well as the formalism of a frequentist approach to estimate the significance with a profile likelihood ratio test statistic .",
    "section  [ sec : effect ] focuses on the application of the profile likelihood test to estimate the impact of the different experimental issues on the sensitivity of upcoming directional detector .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : prospect ] we conclude this study by considering two very different detectors with their respective performance to evaluate both their sensitivity to dark matter from supersymmetric models and their competitivity in comparison to existing limits .",
    "there is a worldwide effort toward the development of a large tpc ( time projection chamber ) devoted to directional detection @xcite and all current projects @xcite face common experimental challenges and share a unique goal : the simultaneous measurement of the energy ( @xmath4 ) and the 3d track ( @xmath5 ) of low energy recoils , thus allowing to evaluate the double - differential spectrum @xmath6 down to the energy threshold .",
    "this can be achieved with low pressure gaseous detectors ( tpc ) and several gases have been suggested : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "experimental key issues include : sense recognition  @xcite , angular and energy resolutions , energy threshold as well as the residual background contamination .",
    "+ bearing in mind the need for a directional detector optimization  @xcite at the current stage of detector design , we present in section [ sec : effect ] a study of the effect of detector configurations in the case of a working example : a low exposure ( 30 kg.year ) @xmath7 tpc , operated at low pressure and allowing 3d track reconstruction as proposed by the mimac collaboration @xcite .",
    "directional detection depends crucially on the local wimp velocity distribution @xcite . the isothermal sphere halo model is often considered but it is worth going beyond this standard paradigm when trying to account for all astrophysical uncertainties",
    ". the multivariate gaussian wimp velocity distribution corresponds to the generalization of the standard isothermal sphere @xcite with a density profile @xmath11 , leading to a smooth wimp velocity distribution , a flat rotation curve and no substructure . the wimp velocity distribution in the laboratory frame",
    "is given by , @xmath12}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 $ ] is the velocity dispersion tensor assumed to be diagonal in the galactic rest frame ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 is the sun s velocity vector with respect to the galactic rest frame .",
    "when neglecting the sun peculiar velocity and the earth orbital velocity about the sun , @xmath17 corresponds to the detector velocity in the galactic rest frame and is taken to be @xmath18 km.s@xmath19 along the @xmath15 axis pointing toward the cygnus constellation at ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "+ the directional recoil rate is given by @xcite : @xmath22 with @xmath23 the wimp mass , @xmath24 the wimp - nucleus reduced mass , @xmath25 the local dark matter density , @xmath26 the wimp - nucleus elastic scattering cross section , @xmath27 the form factor ( using the axial expression from @xcite ) , @xmath28 the minimal wimp velocity required to produce a nuclear recoil of energy @xmath4 and @xmath29 the direction of the recoil momentum .",
    "finally , @xmath30 is the three - dimensional radon transform of the wimp velocity distribution @xmath31 .",

    "however , to assess the significance of the discovery , in a frequentist approach and taking into account astrophysical uncertainties , a complete statistical analysis is required , as outlined below .      the effect of astrophysical parameters on exclusion limits deduced from direct detection , both from energy , annual modulation and direction measurements , has been investigated in detail in  @xcite . for a complete discussion on their evaluations , uncertainties and effect on dark matter detection ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein . for dark matter search ,",
    "both direct and directional , it is indeed of great interest to account for uncertainties on astrophysical parameters , as in @xcite , although it has been done for the escape velocity only , within the framework of a profile likelihood ratio test statistic .",
    "+ three astrophysical parameters play a key role : the local dark matter density @xmath25 , the sun s velocity vector @xmath33 and the wimp velocity distribution , parametrized by the velocity dispersions along the three axes @xmath34 . +",
    "as the wimp event rate is proportional to the quantity @xmath35 , the value of the local dark matter density @xmath25 directly affects the estimation of the wimp - proton cross section @xmath36 .",
    "a standard value @xmath37 is usually used for the sake of comparison of various direct detector results @xcite .",
    "however , there are still debates on the value of @xmath25 and several papers , using different techniques , have found the following values of the local dark matter density : @xmath38 equal to @xmath39 @xcite , @xmath40 @xcite , @xmath41 @xcite , and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "clearly , systematic errors arise from uncertainties in modeling the milky way .",
    "interestingly , s. garbari _",
    "@xcite point out that it is vital to measure the vertical dispersion profile of the tracers to recover an unbiased estimate of @xmath43 .",
    "depending on the choice of the velocity distribution of star tracer population ( from isothermal to non - isothermal ) , their estimation of @xmath43 can vary by a factor of 10 or so .",
    "recently , m.  c.  smith _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have computed a local dark matter density of @xmath44 using sdss data @xcite by studying the kinematics of galactic disk stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "+ valuable information are also extracted from recent high resolution n - body simulations of milky way like objects .",
    "in particular , it is shown in @xcite that the estimation of the local dark matter density , on the stellar disk and at @xmath458 kpc from the galactic center , is found to be always larger , by 20% or so , than the average density in a spherical shell of same radius , _",
    "i.e _ the above quoted quantity inferred from dynamical measurements .",
    "interestingly , the local dark matter density distribution is predicted @xcite to be remarkably smooth , varying by less than 15% at the 99.9% c.l . from the average value over an ellipsoidal shell",
    "this highlights the fact that the local density , at the sun s location , should not differ from the above estimations .",
    "+ these arguments , both from observations and simulations , add still more weights to the need of taking a possible range of values for the local dark matter density rather than a fixed standard value ( @xmath37 ) , although it allows a fair comparison of various dark matter search results .",
    "hence , to account for all estimations and uncertainties , the local dark matter density @xmath43 is treated hereafter as a nuisance parameter in the following , considering the range @xmath46 , see tab .",
    "[ tab : prior ] .",
    "+ on the choice of mean value and uncertainty , it is worth emphasizing that the local dark matter density is indeed a key experimental issue for directional dark matter search ( as for direction - insensitive one ) but its effect is rather simple to handle . for instance , taking a larger value ( _ e.g. _ as proposed by @xcite ) , say 0.4 instead of 0.3 , will mainly change the sensitivity by 33% , giving in fact a sensitivity to smaller cross sections . for a study aiming at showing the reach of directional detection ,",
    "a modification of the range chosen for the local dark matter density does not affect the result .",
    "this is not the case however , when presenting an experimental result as oulined above .",
    "+ the second astrophysical parameter to be carefully handled is the sun s velocity @xmath33 equal to the local circular speed when neglecting the sun s peculiar velocity .",
    "the standard value is @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "as outlined in @xcite , recent determinations of its value span on a wide range and the impact on directionality has been studied  @xcite .",
    "several papers , using different techniques , have studied the value of local circular speed , giving slightly different values .",
    "they found @xmath48 equal to @xmath49 @xcite , @xmath50 @xcite , @xmath51 @xcite , @xmath52 @xcite and @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the evaluation of the sun s circular velocity depends crucially on the value of the distance of the sun to the galactic centre ( @xmath54 ) which is also poorly known : @xmath55 @xcite and @xmath56 @xcite . in the following ,",
    "the local circular speed is treated as a nuisance parameter , considering the range @xmath57 , see tab .",
    "[ tab : prior ] .",
    "+    .gaussian parametrization ( mean and standard deviation ) of the different astrophysical nuisance parameters . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on figure [ fig : prospectsfinal ] we present the lower bound of the 3@xmath1 discovery region at 90% c.l .",
    "in the ( @xmath58 ) plane corresponding to the detectors a ( red solid line ) and b ( blue solid line ) . for comparison with other direct searches ,",
    "we have reported current limits from simple @xcite ( black solid line ) , coupp @xcite ( black dashed line ) and kims @xcite ( black dotted line ) .",
    "all limits are given in the pure - proton approximation @xcite .",
    "to evaluate the discovery potential of dark matter corresponding to the detectors a and b we have reported the theoretical region obtained within the framework of the constrained minimal supersymmetric model , taken from @xcite , as the green contour .",

    "constraints from collider data and relic abundance are accounted for .",
    "exclusion limits from direct searches are also shown : simple @xcite ( black solid line ) , coupp @xcite ( dotted line ) and kims @xcite ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "the first result that can be inferred from figure [ fig : prospectsfinal ] is that the sensitivity of detector a is about one order of magnitude below the one from detector b for wimp masses above 50 gev / c@xmath59 and about three order of magnitude for @xmath60 gev / c@xmath59 .",
    "this highlights the need for detector optimization and justify a substantial experimental effort on directional detection to reach a high performance detector .",
    "it also means that , contrarily to detector a , detector b will not be sensitive to light wimp below @xmath45 20 gev / c@xmath59 .",
    "the second result is that both detector a and b are competitive as they are 1 and 2 orders of magnitude below current exclusion limits .",
    "moreover , both of them should be able to reach a large part of the predicted supersymmetric model which is motivated both by particle physics and cosmological constraints .",
    "hence , even a low performance directional detector , with a 30 kg.year exposure , could allow to identify wimp events as such by recovering , with a high significance , the main incoming direction of the events .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the use of a profile likelihood ratio test statistic is very well suited when trying to estimate the sensitivity of a given directional experiment .",
    "indeed , it allows us to propagate , using a frequentist approach , some astrophysical uncertainties that are very important in the field of direct searches of dark matter .",
    "this way , we have studied one by one the impact on the sensitivity of most of the experimental issues related to directional detection in the goal of directional detection optimization .",
    "we have then been able to elaborate a weighted wish list where we found that the energy threshold and the background contamination are the most dominant effect . about the effect of angular resolution and sense recognition efficiency",
    ", we found that they could affect strongly ( about a factor of 4 - 5 ) the sensitivity of a directional experiment especially at high wimp mass @xmath61 gev / c@xmath59 . on the other hand",
    ", we found that the energy resolution of the detector affects the sensitivity only in a negligible way , even in extreme and unrealistic cases .",
    "however , detector commissioning is compulsory to derive relevant exclusion limits or discovery regions .",
    "+ finally , we found that directional detection with a 10 kg cf@xmath0 time projection chamber should be able to reach an important part of supersymmetric models and be competitive with current experimental limits , even in the case of a directional experiment with very low performance .",
    "hence , we believe that directional detection of dark matter is a very promising direct search for dark matter that should be able to clearly authenticate a genuine positive detection with a high significance .",
