    "recommender systems suggest items of interest to users , therefore they serve as an essential part of e - commerce . to date , hundreds of methods have been proposed .",
    "collaborative filtering methods @xcite base their recommendations on the historical data of the current user and other users",
    ". content - based filtering methods @xcite involve the attribute information of users and items , and the historical data of the current user .",
    "hybrid methods @xcite integrate these two methods and take advantages of both .",
    "recently , ensemble methods @xcite are proposed to aggregate predications of base algorithms .",
    "the cold - start problem @xcite is difficult in recommender systems .",
    "researchers have addressed the cold - start problem where either the user or the item is new .",
    "the new item problem @xcite is more often addressed , and the new user problem is symmetric to it @xcite . naturally , content - based filtering methods @xcite are appropriate for these problems .",
    "however , the situation with both new user and new item has seldom been considered . since the historical data of the current user and item are unknown , the problem for this situation is more challenging .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a cold - start recommendation approach for the new situation based on granular association rules .",
    "this approach is also applicable to existing situations .",
    "first , we provide a means for describing users and items through information granules .",
    "examples of information granules include  male students , \"  thriller movies , \" and  adventure movies released in 1990s \" .",
    "then we provide a means for generating association rules between users and items .",
    "an example granular association rule might be ",
    "60% male students rate 40% drama movies released in 1990s ; 20% users are male students and 5% movies are drama released in 1990s . \" here 60% , 40% , 20% , and 5% are the source coverage , the target coverage , the source confidence , and the target confidence , respectively . to obtain strong and meaningful rules",
    ", we need to specify thresholds for all four measures .",
    "finally , we provide a means for recommending items to users using these rules .",
    "the quality of the recommender is evaluated mainly by the recommendation accuracy .",
    "there are already some works on granular association rules .",
    "the concept is defined in @xcite with a number of algorithms computing all granular association rules meeting thresholds of four measures . a more efficient algorithm which takes advantage of rough set theory",
    "is presented in @xcite .",
    "two discretization approaches are studied in @xcite for numeric data .",
    "multi - value data are then addressed in @xcite to obtain positive rules and discard negative rules such as  male students rate movies that are _ not _ comedy . \"",
    "this is because negative rules are uninteresting in such applications and they overwhelm positive ones",
    ".    the main contribution of this paper will be the validation of granular association rules .",
    "in other words , we train and test granular association rules to study their performance .",
    "this work is an important step toward the application of granular association rules @xcite as well as granular computing @xcite .",
    "experiments are undertaken on the movielens dataset @xcite using our open source software grale @xcite .",
    "results indicate that rule sets perform similarly on the training and the testing sets .",
    "more importantly , the appropriate setting of granule is essential to the application of granular association rules .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : preliminaries ] reviews some concepts including many - to - many entity - relationship systems , information granules and granular association rules .",
    "then section [ section : train - test ] describes the training and testing of a rule set .",
    "experimental results on the movielens dataset are discussed in section [ section : experiments ] .",
    "finally , section [ section : conclusion ] presents some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we present some preliminary knowledge , especially granular association rules .      first we revisit the definitions of information systems , binary relations and many - to - many entity relationship systems @xcite .",
    "[ definition : ins ] @xmath0 is an information system , where @xmath1 is the set of all objects , @xmath2 is the set of all attributes , and @xmath3 is the value of @xmath4 on attribute @xmath5 for @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "two information systems are listed in tables [ subtable : user ] and [ subtable : movie ] , respectively . in table",
    "[ subtable : movie ] , 1 indicates _ true _ , while 0 indicates _",
    "[ definition : binary - relation ] let @xmath1 and @xmath8 be two sets of objects .",
    "any @xmath9 is a binary relation from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "an example of binary relation is given by table [ subtable : rates ] , where @xmath10 is the set of users as indicated by table [ subtable : user ] , and @xmath11 is the set of movies as indicated by table [ subtable : movie ] .",
    "a binary relation can be viewed as an information system . however , in order to save storage space , it is more often stored in the database as a table with two foreign keys .",
    "[ definition : m - m - er ] a many - to - many entity - relationship system ( mmer ) is a 5-tuple @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two information systems , and @xmath9 is a binary relation from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "an example of mmer is given by table [ table : mmer ] .",
    "now we employ information granules @xcite to describe users and items . in an information system",
    ", any @xmath15 induces an equivalence relation @xcite @xmath16 and partitions @xmath10 into a number of disjoint subsets called _ blocks _ or _",
    "granules_. the granule containing @xmath17 is @xmath18    the following definition was employed by yao and deng @xcite .    [ definition : granule ] a granule is a triple @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the name assigned to the granule , @xmath21 is a representation of the granule , and @xmath22 is a set of objects that are instances of the granule .",
    "according to equation ( [ equation : block - contain - x ] ) , @xmath23 determines a granule in an information system .",
    "hence @xmath24 is a natural name to the granule .",
    "@xmath21 can be formalized as the conjunction of respective attribute - value pairs , i.e. , @xmath25 @xmath22 is given by @xmath26    the _ support _ of the granule is the size of @xmath22 divided by the size of the universe , namely , @xmath27    let @xmath17 and @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 consequently , we say that @xmath30 is _ finer _ than @xmath31 , or @xmath31 is _ coarser _ than @xmath30 .",
    "now we discuss the means for connecting users and items .",
    "a _ granular association rule _",
    "@xcite is an implication of the form @xmath32 where @xmath15 and @xmath33 .    before defining evaluation measures ,",
    "let us look at an example of granular association rule ",
    "60% male students rate 40% drama movies released in 1990s ; 20% users are male students and 5% movies are drama released in 1990s . \"",
    "here 60% , 40% , 20% , and 5% are the source coverage , the target coverage , the source confidence , and the target confidence , respectively .    according to equations ( [ equation : intension - granule ] ) , ( [ equation : extension - granule ] ) and ( [ equation : granular - association ] ) , the set of objects meeting the left - hand side of the granular association rule is @xmath34 while the set of objects meeting the right - hand side of the granular association rule is @xmath35    the _ source coverage _ of @xmath36 is @xmath37 while the _ target coverage _ of @xmath36 is @xmath38    there is a tradeoff between the source confidence and the target confidence .",
    "consequently , neither of them can be obtained directly from the rule . to compute any one of them , we need to specify the threshold of the other . in our computation , we adopt the following approach .",
    "let @xmath39 be the target confidence threshold .",
    "the _ source confidence _ of the rule is @xmath40    naturally , the source coverage and the target coverage indicate the generality of a rule , while the source confidence and the target confidence indicate the strength of a rule .",
    "the set of all possible granular association rules might be very large . therefore we would like to train a relatively small rule set . the key issue is : which rules should be included in this set for recommendation ?",
    "one approach is to specify thresholds of four measures mentioned in section [ subsection : grarule - rules ] .",
    "all rules satisfying these thresholds are generated to build the recommender .",
    "[ problem : partial - rule ] the granular association rule mining problem .",
    "* input : * an @xmath12 , a minimal source coverage threshold @xmath41 , a minimal target coverage threshold @xmath42 , a minimal source confidence threshold @xmath43 , and a minimal target confidence threshold @xmath39 .",
    "* output : * a rule set where each rule satisfying @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "algorithm [ algorithm : sandwich ] is a straightforward approach to obtaining this rule set .",
    "it is quite similar to the algorithm presented in @xcite .",
    "the difference lies in that the new algorithm stores the rule set in the memory instead of outputting it directly .",
    "another algorithm presented in @xcite can be also revised for this problem to improve efficiency . since the focus of the paper is the effectiveness of the algorithm",
    ", we will not discuss it here .    * input * : @xmath12 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath39 . +",
    "* output * : a rule set . + * method * : sandwich .",
    "+    @xmath48 ; @xmath49 ; @xmath50 ; add @xmath36 to the rule set ;    for each user , we recommend items of interest using the rule set .",
    "all rules that match the user are fired for recommendation .",
    "hence some users may have many recommendations , and some may have very few .",
    "the performance of the recommender is evaluated mainly by the recommendation accuracy .",
    "formally , let the number of recommended items be @xmath51 , and the number of success recommendations be @xmath52 , the accuracy is @xmath53 .",
    "we will compare five training and testing scenarios .",
    "random recommendation .",
    "there is no training stage .",
    "an item is randomly recommended to a user .",
    "this is a baseline approach since a recommender which is not significantly better than a random one is simply useless .",
    "test the training set .",
    "it is interesting to test the rule set on the training set .",
    "since only attribute values can be employed , the performance of the rule set may not be high .",
    "divide the user set into the training and testing set .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the new user cold - start problem .",
    "4 .   divide the item set into the training and testing set .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the new item cold - start problem .",
    "divide both the user and the item sets . in this scenario ,",
    "both users and items are new .",
    "hence the problem is very challenging .",
    "in this section , we try to answer the following questions through experimentation .    1 .",
    "how does the recommender perform for the new user , new item , and both new cold - start problems ? 2 .",
    "how does the number of recommendations change for different thresholds ? 3 .",
    "how does the performance of the recommender vary for the training / testing sets ?",
    "4 .   how does the performance of the recommender change for different threshold settings ?",
    "we tested granular association rules on the movielens @xcite which is widely used in recommender systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the database schema is as follows .",
    "1 .   user ( , age , gender , occupation ) 2 .",
    "movie ( , release - year , genre ) 3 .   rates ( )    we use the version with 943 users and 1,682 movies .",
    "the data are preprocessed to cope with definition [ definition : m - m - er ] as follows .",
    "the original rate relation contains the rating of movies with 5 scales , while we only consider whether or not a user has rated a movie .",
    "the user age is discretized to 5 intervals as follows : [ 7,22 ) , [ 22,27 ) , [ 27,31 ) , [ 31,39 ) , [ 39,48 ) and [ 48,73 ] .",
    "the release year is discretized to 5 intervals as follows : [ 1922,1980 ) , [ 1980,1993 ) , [ 1993,1994 ) , [ 1994,1995),[1995,1996 ) , [ 1996,1997 ) and [ 1997,1998 ] .",
    "the genre is a multi - valued attribute .",
    "therefore we scale it to 18 boolean attributes and deal with it using the approach proposed in @xcite .",
    "we undertake three sets of experiments to answer the questions raised at the beginning of the section one by one .",
    "the settings are as follows : the training set percentage is 60% , and @xmath54 .",
    "each experiment is repeated 20 times with different sampling of training and testing sets , and the average accuracy is computed .",
    "[ figure : scenarios ] shows accuracy of the recommender on the new user , new item , and both new scenarios .",
    "the random recommender , which has an accuracy close to 0.062 , is also illustrated for comparison .",
    "the result indicates that the new item problem is easier and respective recommendations are more meaningful .",
    "the both new scenario is the hardest since the least information is available .",
    "[ figure : recommendations ] indicates that the number of recommendations decrease dramatically with the increase of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "[ figure : granules ] indicates with the change of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the recommender performs different .",
    "the following observations are especially interesting from this figure .    1 .   when @xmath41 and @xmath42 are appropriately set ( 0.04 ) , the recommender has the maximal accuracy . with the increase or decrease of these thresholds ,",
    "the performance of the recommender decreases rapidly .",
    "this is the most important observation from the experiment .",
    "2 .   the performance of the recommender does not vary much on the training and the testing sets .",
    "this phenomenon indicates that the recommender is stable .",
    "3 .   the recommender achieves the best performance for both the training and the testing set with the same settings .",
    "this is somehow surprising since the recommender does not incur over - fitting .",
    "in this paper , granular association rules are trained to build cold - start recommender .",
    "we specify different granules in terms of source coverage and target coverage to obtain different recommenders .",
    "experimental results indicate that the appropriate selection of the granule are essential to the performance of the recommender . in the future",
    "we will design algorithms for effective granule selection .",
