    "<S> dark energy can be attributed to the dynamics of a scalar field , called quintessence  @xcite , which convincingly realize the present accelerated expansion of the universe by using late - time attractor solutions in which the scalar field mimics the perfect fluid in a wide range of parameters . but regarded as dark energy , quintessence field with the state equation parameter @xmath0 may be not consistent with recent observation  @xcite . in order to obtain @xmath1 , phantom field with reverse sign in its dynamical term </S>",
    "<S> may be a simplest implementing and can be regarded as one of interesting possibilities describing dark energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical background for phantom type of matter with strongly negative pressure would be found in string theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phantom field may also arise from a bulk viscous stress due to particle production  @xcite or in higher - order theories of gravity  @xcite , brans - dicke and non - minimally coupled scalar field theories  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological models which allow for phantom matter appear naturally in the mirage cosmology of the braneworld scenario  @xcite and in k - essence models  @xcite . in spite of the fact that the field theory of phantom fields encounters the problem of stability which one could try to bypass by assuming them to be effective fields  @xcite , it is nevertheless interesting to study their cosmological implication . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there are many relevant studies of phantom energy  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical properties of phantom energy are rather weird , as they include violation of the dominant - energy condition , naive superluminal sound speed and increasing energy density with time . </S>",
    "<S> the latter property ultimately leads to unwanted future singularity called big rip . </S>",
    "<S> this singularity is characterized by the divergence of the scale factor in a finite time in future  @xcite . to avoid the cosmic doomsday , </S>",
    "<S> specific scalar field models were proposed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it requires a special class of phantom field potentials with local maximum . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the energy density of the phantom field increases with time , while the energy density of the matter fluid decreases as the universe evolves . why the energy densities of dark matter and phantom energy are of the same order just at the present epoch ? in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the role of a possible coupling of dark matter and phantom field for the coincidence problem . with the help of a suitable coupling  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we find that there exists a stationary scaling solution and demonstrate numerically that it is a stable attractor at late times . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the cosmic doomsday is avoided in one region of the parameter space .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case in which both the phantom energy with constant @xmath1 and the cold dark matter are present . </S>",
    "<S> then , if the universe ceases to be matter - dominated at cosmological time @xmath2 , the scale factor can be written as @xmath3^{2/3(1+w)}\\ ] ] at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the scale factor blows up at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs because , even though the energy densities in ordinary types of matter are redshifting away , the energy density of phantom energy increases in an expanding universe . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that both components decrease with time if there is a transfer of energy from the phantom field to the matter fluid . </S>",
    "<S> then the cosmic doomsday may be avoided .    for a spatially flat frw universe with the matter fluid @xmath6 and the phantom field @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> friedmann equation can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational coupling and the energy density and pressure , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , of the homogeneous phantom field @xmath7 are given by @xmath12 respectively , in which @xmath13 is the phantom field potential . </S>",
    "<S> we postulate that the two components , @xmath10 and @xmath6 , interact through the interaction term @xmath14 according to @xmath15 where @xmath16 satisfy @xmath17 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction term @xmath14 represents an additional degree of freedom which can be specified by the existence of solution with a stationary energy density ratio @xmath19 at late times . using eqs.([em1 ] ) and ( [ em2 ] ) we obtain the evolution equation of the ratio @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> : @xmath21 obviously , the suitable interaction @xmath22 guarantees the existence of the stationary solution . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath23 , which implies there is a transfer of energy from the phantom field to the matter fluid .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume an interaction characterized by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the transfer strength , which has already been discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . when @xmath26 and @xmath27 are assumed to be constants , the two stationary solutions to eq.([qe ] ) are @xmath28 which imply @xmath29 and @xmath30 when @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> a stability analysis of the stationary solution indicates that the matter - dominated scaling solution @xmath32 is unstable , while the phantom - dominated scaling solution @xmath33 is stable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density ratio @xmath20 evolves from the unstable stationary value @xmath34 to the stable stationary solution @xmath35 , which is clearly compatible with the presently favored observational data @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this may provide us with the dynamics of the density ratio that is relevant to the solution of the coincidence problem .    </S>",
    "<S> now consider the case of @xmath38 ( i.e. cold dark matter ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will investigate the cosmological evolution with the stationary density ratio @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> substituting eq.([qe ] ) into eq.([em1 ] ) , it follows that @xmath39 which yields @xmath40 where @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> if the expansion is matter dominated until the time @xmath2 , then we can write the scale factor as @xmath42 using the definitions of @xmath20 and @xmath26 , the friedmann equation ( [ fe ] ) gives @xmath43 in terms of @xmath7 , ( [ rp ] ) becomes @xmath44 since @xmath26 is a constant , that is , potential and kinetic energies of the phantom field remain proportional , it follows that @xmath45 it is reassuring to find an exponential potential because this type potentials arise very naturally in the models of unification , such as kaluza - klein theories , supergravity theories and string theories . </S>",
    "<S> similar result has been obtained in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors started with an exponential potential in which there is a free parameter and then investigated the parameter range for which there exists a stable scaling solution . </S>",
    "<S> we have first constructed a solution with expected properties and then derived the corresponding potential . in the coupled phantom scenario , it is surprising that the signs of the exponent in eq.([ve ] ) are different in different regions of the parameter space , which are determined by the signs of the parameter @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we will find that the increasing potential corresponds to a climbing - up phantom field while the decreasing potential corresponds to a rolling - down phantom field .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent observations indicate that approximately 0.3 and 0.7 of the total energy density of the universe attribute to dark matter and dark energy , respectively . to solve the coincidence problem of our present universe , </S>",
    "<S> the stable stationary ratio of the energy densities should satisfy @xmath47 , which corresponds to @xmath48 ( i.e. the regions i and ii in figure 1 ) . in the region </S>",
    "<S> i @xmath49 for @xmath50 , since @xmath51 , the energy density of the phantom field decreases in an expanding universe and the universe accelerates without a big rip in the future . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the region ii @xmath52 for @xmath50 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 , @xmath55 indicates that the universe accelerates until a big rip occurs at @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the energy transfer from the phantom field to the cold dark matter prolongs the lifetime of the universe .    </S>",

    "<S> there exist no stable scaling solutions with @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the universe accelerates for ever in the region i , while the universe leads to a big rip in the future in the region ii . ]    to study an explicit numerical evolution of the energy density ratio @xmath20 and the phantom energy density ( or the matter energy density ) , it is most convenient to rewrite the evolution equations ( [ re ] ) and ( [ em1 ] ) ( or eq.([em2 ] ) ) as a set of two first - order differential equations with two independent variables @xmath20 and @xmath10 ( or @xmath6 ) @xmath57 where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the logarithm of the scalar factor , @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> . let us consider two points , ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) and ( @xmath61 , @xmath60 ) in the regions i and ii of the ( @xmath26 , @xmath25 ) parameter space in figure 1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we choose different initial conditions and follow the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that an initial energy density ratio decreases and there exist an attractor curve , which corresponds to the stationary scaling solution . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the universe evolves from a dark matter dominance to a phantom dominance and the energy density ratio of the two components becomes a constant ultimately . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the stationary energy density ratio increases as the transfer strength @xmath25 increases when @xmath26 is fixed . in figures 2 and 3 , </S>",
    "<S> the energy densities of the two components redshift away . from eqs.([rpe ] ) and ( [ ve ] ) , we note that the phantom field rolls down the exponent potential . in figures 4 and 5 , </S>",
    "<S> the energy density of the phantom field increases with time , while the energy density of the cold dark matter decreases initially and then increases ultimately with time . from eqs.([rpe ] ) and ( [ ve ] ) , we note that the phantom field climbs up the exponent potential .    </S>",
    "<S> we have considered above that the present accelerated expansion of our flat frw universe is driven by an interacting mixture of a matter fluid and a phantom field with @xmath1 . in the absence of interaction , as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there exist no scaling solutions because the phantom energy increases while the matter energy decreases with time . with the help of a suitable coupling </S>",
    "<S> , there exists a stable , stationary scaling solution , which requires a transfer of energy from the phantom field to the matter fluid . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate numerically that an interaction between cold dark matter and phantom field can drive the transition from a matter dominance to a phase of accelerated expansion with a stationary ratio of the energy densities of the two components . </S>",
    "<S> this interacting phantom approach indicates a phenomenological solution of the coincidence problem . </S>",
    "<S> the different regions in the ( @xmath26 , @xmath25 ) parameter space lead to different fates of the universe . in the region </S>",
    "<S> i , the phantom field rolls down the exponent potential and the universe accelerates without the cosmic doomsday . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the region ii , the phantom energy increases as the phantom field climbs up the potential , which lead to the divergence of scale factor in the future . </S>",
    "<S> coupling of the quintessence field to dark matter may be worrisome because of quantum corrections to the quintessence potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is valuable to study the stability of the phantom potential under quantum fluctuations in the case with a coupling to dark matter .    * note added . </S>",
