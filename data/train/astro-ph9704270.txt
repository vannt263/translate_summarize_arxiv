    "the old nova gk persei ( nova per 1901 ) is an intriguing cataclysmic variable ( cv ) .",
    "it is one of a few old novae known to undergo dwarf nova outbursts , albeit with the unusually long recurrence time of @xmath3 400 d ( sabbadin & bianchini 1983 ) .",
    "the system has a coherent 351 s x - ray pulsation ( norton et al .",
    "1988 , norton & watson 1989 , ishida et al .",
    "1992 ) that has also been detected in ultraviolet light curves ( patterson 1991 ) .",
    "longer wavelength optical light curves show quasi - periodic oscillations at periods of 360400 s ( patterson 1991 ) .",
    "although the optical spectrum of gk per is normal compared to other long period cvs , its ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum has a flat continuum and strong emission lines compared to other dwarf novae .",
    "the emission lines remain prominent throughout outburst , even though the uv continuum temperature is cool , @xmath6 k.    gk per has many properties in common with the dq her subclass of cvs , which are magnetic binaries also known as intermediate polars ( warner 1985 ) .",
    "most of the system s ` unusual ' properties are then understood if an accretion disk fed by the lobe - filling k0 secondary is truncated by a magnetic field well above the white dwarf photosphere .",
    "the x - ray pulsations result from ` hot spots ' where the magnetic accretion columns impact a white dwarf with a rotation period of 351 s. the flat uv spectrum and the long recurrence time for dwarf nova outbursts also support this interpretation . for outbursts beginning in the inner region of the accretion disk ( e.g. smak 1991,1993 , kim et al .",
    "1992 ) , assuming that the effective disk temperature in the inner region is constant , the recurrence time scale is roughly the viscous time scale @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radius of the thermally unstable inner region of the disk and @xmath9 is the kinematic viscosity coefficient ( smak 1993 ) . using smak s ( 1993 ) formula for the critical surface density , @xmath10 , for the cold branch disk and @xmath11 ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "1992 ) , the recurrence time scale can be estimated as t_rec~[1.410 ^ 4 s ] ( 0.01)^-0.79 ( m_*m_)^1.74(m10 ^ 15 g / s ) ^-1(r10 ^ 9 cm)^3.11 where @xmath12 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter ( e.g. , frank et al . 1992 ) , @xmath13 is the mass of the accreting white dwarf , and @xmath1 is the mass accretion rate in the inner region of the the cold disk ( which is different from the mass transfer rate ) .",
    "the recurrence time scale depends very weakly on the mass transfer rate ( e.g. cannizzo & mattei 1992 ) . for a typical quiescent @xmath14",
    ", the observed long recurrence time scale implies a truncated disk with an inner radius of @xmath15 cm ( cannizzo & kenyon 1986 , angelini & verbunt 1989 , kim et al .",
    "the lack of disk material close to the white dwarf also produces a flat uv continuous spectrum by reducing the characteristic disk temperature .    despite the conceptual simplicity of this interpretation ,",
    "several observations of gk per remain poorly understood .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is a small fraction of the uv luminosity in outburst and quiescence as in other dq her systems ( patterson 1994 ) .",
    "both the flat uv spectrum and the outburst recurrence time scale require inner disk radii large compared to the corotation radius of a white dwarf with a 351 s spin period , @xmath15 cm vs @xmath16 cm .",
    "accretion should not occur in the circumstances .",
    "the uv spectrum further requires larger values for both @xmath17 and @xmath18 than allowed by disk instability models for the eruption .    in this paper , we consider gk per as a laboratory to test our understanding of the physics of the disk - magnetosphere interaction . besides disrupting the disk at an inner radius larger than the stellar radius",
    ", the stellar magnetosphere redistributes angular momentum and energy through torques on disk material ( ghosh & lamb 1979ab ) .",
    "this interaction modifies the disk temperature distribution and accretion luminosity in a predictable way that observations can test directly ( mauche et al .",
    "1990 , kenyon et al . 1996 )",
    "we focus on the dissipation in the disk with some recent improvements and use emission from the accretion column and the disk as diagnostic tools for magnetized accretion disk models .",
    "our goal is to use the observed uv spectrum and various x - ray constraints to develop a self - consistent picture for this and other dq her system .",
    "we begin with a discussion of simple disk models in  2 , describe and apply a magnetized disk model in  , consider x - ray heating of the disk in  4 , and conclude with a brief summary and discussion in  5 .",
    "the uv spectrum of gk per at maximum is very unusual compared to other dwarf novae in outburst ( see also wu et al .",
    "the dereddened continuum is almost flat in @xmath19 over 12003200    and closely resembles the continuum of a b8-b9 v star with an effective temperature of 10,00012,000 k ( wu et al .",
    "in contrast , the uv continua of most dwarf novae at maximum resemble spectra of much hotter b2-b3 v - iii stars having temperatures of @xmath3 20,000 k ( la dous 1991 ) . the uv spectrum of gk per also contains strong he  ii , c  iv , and n  v emission lines .",
    "these lines are usually strong absorption features in dwarf novae at maximum , although some have very weak emission lines ( la dous 1991 ) .",
    "the strong emission features in gk per are similar in strength to lines observed in other dq her - type stars in the high state ( la dous 1991 ) .",
    "the he  ii line in gk per is , however , exceptionally strong compared to lines observed in most dq her stars .",
    "bianchini & sabbadin ( 1983 ) first showed that standard steady - state disk models could not reproduce uv observations of gk per at minimum .",
    "wu et al . ( 1989 ) reached the same conclusions for outburst spectra .",
    "both groups showed that disks with an inner hole could roughly match observed fluxes .",
    "bianchini & sabbadin ( 1983 ) estimated an inner disk radius of @xmath20 cm for @xmath21 at minimum ; wu et al . preferred a much larger inner radius , @xmath22 cm , in outburst",
    "when @xmath23 .",
    "wu et al . (",
    "1989 ) remarked that the uv data do not constrain @xmath18 and @xmath17 independently , because any disk model with a maximum temperature of @xmath6 k produces a flat spectrum similar to the observed spectrum .",

    "the observed fluxes have an intrinisic uncertainty of @xmath2510% as indicated by the error bar .",

    "the disk has a corotation radius of @xmath29 for a rotational period of @xmath30 s and an outer radius of @xmath31 appropriate for the k0 iv secondary ( e.g. , cannizzo & kenyon 1986 ) .",
    "we adopt a disk inclination of @xmath32 = 60@xmath33 and a distance of 470 pc ( e.g. , bianchini & sabbadin 1983 , crampton et al .",

    "this model  and any other steady disk model with @xmath38  is too blue due to the high temperatures , @xmath3 23 @xmath39 k , near the corotation radius . the second model ( ss2 ) has the correct uv slope but is not luminous enough .",
    "more luminous models are hotter than this model and fail to match the uv slope .",
    "we could match the uv data better with a smaller @xmath32 for model ss2 , but observations of binary motion in gk per preclude @xmath40 45@xmath33 ( crampton et al . 1986 ) .",
    "non - steady disk models also fail to match uv observations of gk per .",
    "kim et al .",
    "( 1992 ) developed disk instability models to account for the system s dwarf nova eruptions and matched the visual magnitude and recurrence time of typical eruptions .",
    "we read the temperature distribution for their model 82 from their figure 8 to compute the ` di ' spectrum shown in figure 1 .",
    "our calculation reproduces kim et al.s spectrum in their figure 9 to @xmath3 10% as judged by a visual comparison .",
    "the spectrum of this model resembles our second steady - state model and also falls short of the observations .",

    "this result is contrary to our expectations in a magnetically truncated disk model .",
    "we expect @xmath42 , which allows disk material to match the rotational velocity of the central star and accrete along magnetic field lines .",
    "the failure of standard disk instability and steady - state disk models suggests that another mechanism heats the disk . to produce a flat uv spectrum in the disk , we require a flatter radial temperature gradient than in a standard steady - state disk model ( e.g. , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 0.50.6 ) .",
    "non - steady disks often have such flat temperature gradients in _ quiescence _ , when the disk mass grows with time ( see kim et al .",
    "most non - steady disk models closely approximate steady disks with @xmath45 during outbursts ( see kim et al .",
    "1992 and references therein ) .",
    "the uv spectra of currently available non - steady models are also not luminous enough ( figure 1 ) .",
    "external heating mechanisms , however , can produce flat temperature gradients .",
    "ghosh & lamb ( 1979ab ) first showed that the magnetic torque at the inner edge of a magnetically truncated disk acts to flatten the disk temperature gradient close to the corotation radius .",
    "mauche et al .",

    "x - ray heating is another external mechanism that can flatten the disk temperature distribution .",

    ", illuminated disk can approach @xmath46 in some disks ( e.g. , kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) .",
    "we will first consider magnetic heating in  3 and then develop a simple x - ray heating model in  4 .",
    "to estimate the magnitude of disk heating in the gk per disk , we need to derive the disk truncation radius , @xmath18 , and the magnetic torque on the disk , @xmath47 . to compute these quantities ,",
    "we follow yi ( 1995 ) and adopt a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk in which the viscous angular momentum transport is parametrized by the conventional @xmath12-viscosity ( e.g. , frank et al . 1992 ; see also wang 1987 ; campbell 1992 ; kenyon , yi , & hartmann 1996 ) .",
    "the magnetic stress truncates the disk roughly where magnetic pressure halts the slow inward drift of disk material .",
    "this stress also provides an additional dissipative heating term .",
    "both the truncation radius and the heating are essential ingredients for a self - consistent model of the observed disk emission .",
    "neither of these quantities can be derived completely from first principles : we thus follow previous investigations and parameterize the interaction between the disk and the magnetic field .",
    "we assume a dipolar magnetic field structure , in which the @xmath48-component of the stellar magnetic field is b(r)b_z(r)=-_*r^3   , where @xmath49 is the magnetic moment of the star , @xmath50 is the stellar surface field strength , and @xmath51 is the stellar radius .",

    "we assume the central star radiates this luminosity uniformly in all directions and parameterize the height of the disk photosphere above the midplane as @xmath149 ( see warner 1995 ; kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) . a truncated disk with parameters appropriate for gk per intercepts @xmath3 2% of the accretion luminosity for a standard disk with @xmath150 ; the fraction increases to @xmath3 6% for @xmath151 and @xmath3 19% for @xmath152 = 0.5 ( see kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) . if the disk radiates all of this energy in the continuum , the extra luminosity from x - ray heating is 550 @xmath4 .",

    "this approximation is valid even when the magnetic axis is not aligned with the rotational axis , although the rings are then only partially filled with emission ( knigl 1991 ; hellier 1993 ) .",

    "we then can not simply approximate accretion hot spots as a point close to the white dwarf photosphere , which greatly complicates our calculation of disk heating .",
    "a direct calculation of x - ray processing by the disk is also complicated .",

    "measurements of the h  i line fluxes through an outburst directly constrain the flux from the balmer continuum ; detection of periodic variations in line flux phased with the x - ray period places additional limits on the heating model .",
    "even if x - ray heating does not explain the uv spectrum directly , this heating is an important contribution to the energy balance of the disk itself .",
    "our estimates in  4 indicate that the disk intercepts @xmath3 5% of the accretion energy radiated by material impacting the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "this energy is a significant fraction , @xmath3 10%20% , of the disk luminosity in outburst and probably changes the vertical temperature structure of the disk .",

    "the vertical temperature structure is an important feature of disk instability models that trigger outbursts when disk material is too cold to radiate viscous energy generated locally ( see kim et al . 1992 and references therein ) .",
