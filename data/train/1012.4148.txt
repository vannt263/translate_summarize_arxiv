    "the bulk of classical gravitational effects are described experimentally in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "recently , it was proposed that certain exceptions in theoretical cosmology may be related to the dark matter and dark energy problems and some approaches were formulated for finlser gravity models .",
    "it is also expected that small corrections with violations of equivalence principle and local lorentz invariance ( in brief , lv ) have to be considered in low energy limits within general approaches to quantum gravity ( qg ) .",
    "there are two general classes of finsler type gravity theories :  the first one originates from e. cartan works on finsler geometry @xcite , see further geometrical developments and applications in vstr2,ijgmmp , vncbh , vprincipl , ma . such most related to  standard physics",
    " constructions were elaborated for the metric compatible cartan and canonical distinguished connections ( in brief , d  connections ) .",
    "this class of einstein  finsler gravity ( efg ) models can be elaborated following geometric and physical principles which are very similar to those in gr but with cartan  finsler type connections used instead of the levi  civita connection . in the second class of theories , the finsler connections ( for instance",
    ", the berwald/ chern d  connections ) are not metric compatible @xcite .",

    "conclusions are presented in section [ s4 ] .",
    "we consider four important motivations to study finsler modifications of gravity theories and formulations of gr in almost khler  finsler variables @xcite :    1 .   for deformations of minkovski spacetimes resulting in nonlinear energy  momentum relations , @xmath0 where @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 ( for instance , @xmath5 )",
