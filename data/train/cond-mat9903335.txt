    "it has been realized that nonequilibrium interacting particle systems are capable of exhibiting very interesting and unusual phenomena in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , such as single - defect and boundary induced phase transitions @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is known that some of these phase transitions are accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) @xcite , in which some macroscopic observable of the model behaves in the steady state asymmetrically with respect to what it would be expected from the microscopic rules governing its dynamics .",
    "all this is rather unusual for equilibrium one - dimensional systems of particles interacting through short range forces only , and there have been serious attempts towards the understanding of these phenomena , in particular that of ssb @xcite .",
    "it appears that among the many ingredients favoring ssb to take place , unbounded noise is a key one , whether it comes from the introduction of defects , boundary terms or any microscopic rules rendering a system lacking in detailed balance .",
    "growth models provide a suitable theoretical framework for the investigation of a gamut of model systems @xcite , and it turns out that they can be used to investigate the above mentioned phenomena as well . in a recent work @xcite , a class of growth models addressing both the questions of a roughening transition in one dimension and of ssb was introduced . concerning ssb ,",
    "these authors have inquired about the necessary ingredients in a model in order for it to show ssb , and they found it possible to have ssb characterized by a nonconserved order parameter in a ring geometry , as opposed to the situation in a related model showing the same characteristics but now with the ssb associated with a conserved ( i.e. ,  slow ) order parameter and in the presence of conspicuous boundary terms @xcite . in the unrestricted version , the models can be related to a directed percolation process thus sharing its exponents , a fact that was confirmed by monte carlo simulations @xcite . in the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) version no such relationship exists .",
    "it is possible , however , to arrive through a site - link transformation at an equivalent driven diffusive system in which two types of oppositely charged particles diffuse asymmetrically and are continuously created and annihilated in pairs .    in this work we have proceeded to a further investigation of the rsos version of the models first proposed in @xcite .",
    "our study is based on the mapping of the master equation governing the dynamics of the associated reaction - diffusion process into an imaginary - time schrdinger equation , the hamiltonian of which is that of a spin @xmath0 non - hermitian quantum chain @xcite .",
    "this allows us to employ standard finite - size scaling ( fss ) techniques to the resulting stochastic process , in the same way as one is used to do with hamiltonian theories or with the transfer matrices of classical spins systems @xcite . in this way we were able to analyze the time evolution operator for chains of sizes up to 16 sites , calculating their spectra and stationary states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the basic formalism in which we work , comment on its physical contents and derive the time evolution operator for the particular process we are interested in . in sec .",
    "iii we show and discuss the finite - size data we obtained for the dynamic critical exponent , the order parameter of the roughening transition , and the string order parameter . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we conclude and indicate some directions for further investigation .",
    "we are going to focus on the stochastic particle system associated with the growth model , more specifically on its stochastic transition or intensity matrix .",
    "there is quite a number of different ways of writing down the master equation in operator form , some more suited to the study of symmetries @xcite , some others envisaging a perturbative approach @xcite .",
    "here we give a brief derivation that parallels that of @xcite .",
    "let us attach to each site @xmath1 of a one - dimensional lattice @xmath2 of volume @xmath3 a stochastic variable @xmath4 taking values in the set of states @xmath5 . denoting by @xmath6 the probability of realization of a particular configuration @xmath7 at instant @xmath8",

    "we now introduce vector spaces in the description of eq .",
    "( [ abcd ] ) . to do this we turn @xmath18 into @xmath19 and @xmath20 into @xmath21 . taking the orthonormal basis @xmath22 for @xmath23 we write @xmath24 .",
    "we are in this way providing the space of generating functions with a hilbert space structure .",
    "next we endow the space of linear transformations of @xmath25 with the canonical basis of matrices @xmath26 with elements @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and introduce the operator @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , @xmath31 . a little reflection and comparison",
    "show that within this settings we can write eq .",
    "( [ abcd ] ) in the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 @xmath34 is but the infinitesimal generator of the markov semigroup @xmath35 of the continuous - time markov chain defined by the set of rates @xmath36 . from eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) we see that @xmath34 is a @xmath37 , usually nonsymmetric , and very sparse matrix .",
    "one says that eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) is an imaginary - time schrdinger equation , the fact that @xmath34 has not the physical significance of energy and in general observes @xmath38 notwithstanding .",
    "it is however useful and intuitive to think of @xmath34 as a hamiltonian whose quantum fluctuations govern the time fluctuations of the classical system of particles .",
    "the process we are interested in is a growth model defined as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath39 be the height of a surface at site @xmath40 .",
    "the surface evolves by attempting , sequentially and at randomly chosen sites , adsorption of an adatom @xmath41 with probability @xmath42 , and desorption of an adatom @xmath43 or @xmath44 each with probability @xmath45 .",
    "we now impose the rsos condition @xmath46 , which suggests the use of link variables @xmath47 . in order not to overload the notation with unnecessary pluses and minuses ,",
    "let us take the values of @xmath48 modulo 3 , mapping @xmath49 into @xmath50 , respectively . in this representation",
    "the growth process can be described by the set of transition rates @xmath51 according to eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) we write for this process the time evolution operator as @xmath52 with the two - body stochastic transition matrix given explicitly by @xmath53 where we have ordered the two - site basis vectors antilexicographically , i.e. , @xmath54 , and the dots indicate null entries .    before proceeding to the next section , it is worth mentioning some properties of @xmath34 .",
    "as a stochastic transition matrix , conservation of probability flux requires @xmath55 , which in turn constraint the diagonal elements to be given by @xmath56 , compare with eq .",
    "( [ em ] ) .",
    "the first of these conditions imply the existence of a trivial left eigenstate with zero eigenvalue , @xmath57 with @xmath58 the cardinality of the state space .",
    "this special vector plays a role in the determination of expectation values , for one can write the average of an observable @xmath59 with respect to the probabilities @xmath6 with the aid of @xmath60 as @xmath61 we expect physical observables of the classical system of particles to be diagonal in the natural basis @xmath22 , once they all have to commute .",
    "@xmath34 is obviously not diagonal in this basis , it is not an observable of the system .",
    "( [ expect ] ) summarizes an important difference between quantum physics and the kind of classical physics we have here : it is that expectation values are linear in @xmath62 , not bilinear , the elements of @xmath62 being probabilities themselves , not probability amplitudes .    besides these general properties , our @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ mat ] ) is additionally translation invariant , due to the homogeneous rates in a ring geometry , and possesses a u(1 ) symmetry labeled by the total charge @xmath63 , which is conserved along the process .",
    "these symmetries allow us to block - diagonalize @xmath34 and to write it as the direct sum @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 label the u(1 ) and momentum eigensectors , respectively .",
    "each u(1 ) sector represents a closed class of the stochastic process , the corresponding block matrix @xmath67 being itself a stochastic transition matrix governing the dynamics within the given sector .",
    "we say that our process is decomposable , nonergodic , and that the u(1 ) label classifies its @xmath68 irreducible , closed classes .",
    "the momentum label @xmath66 , however , is introduced here solely in order to take advantage , numerically , of the further reduction of order @xmath69 on the sizes of the blocks @xmath67 it furnishes , the physically relevant momentum sector being the one with @xmath70 , since the zero eigenvalue together with the completely flat surface of the model is in this sector .",
    "one can look for a relation @xmath71 for the real part of the eigenspectrum , but we do not expect to extract useful information , e.g. , about @xmath72 , from this relation for small lattice sizes .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of such a relation for the low lying excitations of the process as a dispersion relation for quasiparticles of a free field theory would be somewhat cavalier ; see @xcite .",
    "according to eqs .  ( [ gammas ] ) , as @xmath73 increases creation of @xmath74 as well as annihilation of @xmath75 pairs increases while the remaining processes induce segregation of particles .",
    "this corresponds to an increase in adsorption and in the growth rate of islands , leading to rougher configurations .",
    "as @xmath73 lowers , increased annihilation of @xmath74 pairs together with more symmetric diffusion of 0 s flatten the surface ; see sec .",
    "iii  c. around the critical point @xmath76 separating these two phases the correlation lengths of the infinite system behave like @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the correlation length in the time direction while @xmath79 is the one in the spatial direction , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 the corresponding critical exponents and @xmath82 the dynamic critical exponent .    for finite systems of size @xmath83 , according to the usual fss assumptions @xcite , we expect the scaling @xmath84 to hold when @xmath85 , the finite version of the critical point @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the finite version of @xmath72 .",
    "on general grounds one expects @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "therefore from eqs .",
    "( [ correl ] ) and ( [ csil ] ) we obtain the relations @xmath90 }             { \\ln ( l / l-1 ) } =        \\frac{\\ln \\left [ \\xi_{\\|,l+1}(q_{c , l})/\\xi_{\\|,l}(q_{c , l } ) \\right ] }             { \\ln(l+1/l ) }   = \\theta_{l},\\ ] ] which through the comparison of three successive system sizes furnishes simultaneously @xmath91 and @xmath87 .",
    "of course @xmath92 , with @xmath93 the first gap of @xmath34 , since for stochastic transition matrices @xmath94 by construction .",
    "we have calculated the gaps @xmath95 in the @xmath96 , @xmath70 sector through the use of the arnoldi algorithm @xcite .",
    "this is a krylov subspace projection technique that effects the reduction of a general nonsymmetric matrix to upper hessenberg form , the eigenpairs of which converge variationally to that of the original matrix with the algebraically larger part of the spectrum converging first . in order to save memory",
    "we have used a restarted version of the algorithm , in which we fix the dimension of the krylov subspace and use some of the approximate eigenvectors obtained in one iteration as the starting vectors for the next iteration , until convergence is obtained to the desired accuracy . in this way we were able to handle matrices of orders up to @xmath97 with up to @xmath98 nonzero entries keeping the krylov subspace always with fewer than 64 vectors .",
    "the results we have obtained are summarized in tabs .",
    "[ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] .",
    "the extrapolated values in the last line of these tables were obtained through the bulirsch - stoer extrapolation scheme @xcite , with @xmath99 the free parameter of the algorithm chosen over a certain range so as to optimize the converge of the finite - size data .    in applying eqs .",
    "( [ fss ] ) we found two consistent , converging sets of data , the first one , shown in table  [ tab1 ] and marked with a prime , realizing the first equality in eqs .",
    "( [ fss ] ) only approximately , and the second one , that in table  [ tab2 ] and marked with two primes , realizing it exactly .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the first set of data exhibited a rather smooth convergence in both the values of @xmath91 and @xmath87 , while the second set behaved more irregularly .",
    "the values in table  [ tab1 ] indicate a second order transition taking place around @xmath100 with a dynamic exponent of @xmath101 .",
    "this value of @xmath102 is compatible with the exponent of the directed percolation process , for which the most accurate value to date , obtained by monte carlo simulations , seems to be @xmath103 @xcite ; it should be mentioned that in an evaluation of @xmath104 more closely related to ours it has been found a value of @xmath105 @xcite , and that it is not clear why such discrepancies arise in the value of @xmath104 calculated by different methods .",
    "the interpretation of the data in table  [ tab2 ] is touchier .",
    "we can see that the values of @xmath106 converge at a reasonable rate to the extrapolated limit @xmath107 , which is different from the previously found @xmath100 .",
    "we believe however that if we have had access to larger lattice sizes , we would have observed @xmath108 , since the values of @xmath109 vary less .",
    "we thus trust the value of @xmath110 as our best estimate for the critical point .",
    "the situation with the critical exponent @xmath111 is different : it seems to be converging to a completely different value than @xmath104 .",
    "in fact , this behavior was to be expected , for it has been found @xcite that in the rough phase @xmath112 the exponents of the process are those of the kardar - parisi - zhang universality class @xcite , in particular @xmath113 . as can be seen from table  [ tab2 ] ,",
    "the first few values of @xmath111 show a monotonic increasing behavior up to @xmath114 , but then the sequence begins to decrease to reach the bottom value of @xmath115 .",
    "a partial extrapolation of the first four points , @xmath116 , gives @xmath117 , while a partial extrapolation of the rest of the points , @xmath118 , gives @xmath119 .",
    "this absence of monotonicity of the finite - size data for @xmath111 is quite unusual , and we have not yet a clear clue to this behavior .",
    "even so , we can take the set of values of @xmath111 in table  [ tab2 ] as indicating the presence of a critical region for @xmath112 with an exponent @xmath120 , possibly with @xmath121 .",
    "concerning the exponent @xmath81 , we found it not possible to apply the standard approach @xcite to obtain its value because the derivatives of @xmath122 with respect to @xmath73 evaluated at the points @xmath91 change sign for some pairs of lattice sizes , thus preventing us from taking logarithms .",
    "the finite - size sequences obtained with the absolute values of these derivatives as well as with those obtained with the derivatives of the absolute values of the gaps also failed to converge , so that we were not able to obtain an estimate of @xmath81 from our diagonalizations .      given that the surface suffers a transition from a flat phase to a rough phase , it is natural to think of an order parameter which measures this transition .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to have an order parameter taking into account the symmetries of the process , which are besides the translational and u(1 ) symmetries , a z@xmath123 symmetry related to the fact that the microscopic dynamics is invariant under an arbitrary integer shift @xmath124 in the heights .",
    "a proper order parameter is given by @xcite @xmath125 which is fast in the sense of not being conserved by the dynamics .",
    "the choice of such an order parameter anticipates the interpretation of the roughening transition ( actually , of the flattening transition ) as the result of a spontaneous break of the z@xmath123 symmetry , for while in the rough phase all heights are exploited evenly , in the flat phase the system spontaneously selects one fiducial level around which the heights fluctuate .",
    "one then expects @xmath126 to be finite in the flat phase while vanishing in the rough phase due to canceling fluctuations .",
    "we have calculated @xmath126 for even @xmath83 between @xmath127 and @xmath128 ; our finite - size data together with the extrapolated values appear in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . from that figure",
    "we clearly see the transition taking place around @xmath129 , although the precise determination of the critical point is not possible from this figure . we have not found the signature of two different @xmath86 s in our data for @xmath130 , which we regard as an indication that @xmath131 should indeed tend to @xmath109 as @xmath132 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath133 vanishes around @xmath134 as @xmath135 .",
    "the plot of @xmath136 for the points @xmath137 of the extrapolated curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] together with a linear regression fit appear in fig .",
    "we found an exponent @xmath138 , which compares well with previous results in the literature : in the first of the papers by alon _",
    "@xcite , @xmath139 has been evaluated as @xmath140 , while in a recent simulation of a model of yeastlike growth of fungi colonies with parallel dynamics it has been found that @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "also in a certain line in the phase diagram of a one - dimensional next - nearest - neighbor asymmetric exclusion process closely related to these growth models it has been found that @xmath142 @xcite . in the second of the papers by alon _",
    "@xcite , however , the more accurate value @xmath143 has been published , pushing the estimate to a somewhat higher value .",
    "recent preliminary monte carlo simulations of ours , on the other hand , suggest a typical ginzburg - landau scenario for the symmetry break in these models , which would then predict an @xmath144 .",
    "we believe that more extensive simulations can settle this point , and work is being done in this direction .      in order to better understand the nature of the roughening transition ,",
    "let us look at some typical microscopic configurations of the model .",
    "the roughest possible surface is given in the links representation by @xmath145 , the state of maximal height in the @xmath96 sector of the dynamics .",
    "in spin language , this state corresponds to two domains separated by two antiferromagnetic ( af ) kinks .",
    "the second roughest possible surface configurations are given by those with a pair of 0 s , e.g. , @xmath146 or @xmath147 .",
    "from this example and the rates in eqs .",
    "( [ gammas ] ) it becomes clear that the flattening process is induced by af kink annihilation , while diffusion of 0 s introduce surface shape fluctuations .",
    "it is important to notice that absence of desorption from the middle of smooth terraces enforces a certain af order among the particles , for pairs are created only as @xmath74 pairs , never as @xmath75 pairs , and since there are no @xmath148 reactions ( which would violate the rsos condition ) , we see that this order persists as long as pairs survive annihilation . in the rough , high @xmath73 phase",
    "the @xmath149 particle will preferably move leftwards , while the @xmath150 particle will prefer to move to the right , eventually leaving a pair of 0 s in between which then generates another @xmath74 pair , thus leading to rough configurations like , e.g. , @xmath151 . in the flat , low @xmath73 phase diffusion of particles becomes more symmetric and segregation of particles less efficient , and we thus expect to observe a more uniform distribution of @xmath74 pairs along the lattice than in the high @xmath73 phase .",
    "the completely flat surface without any af kink is only attained at @xmath152 .    in the context of two - dimensional rsos crystal growth models and the haldane conjecture @xcite",
    ", it has been predicted @xcite and subsequently extensively verified @xcite that a particular type of long - range order exists in the spin @xmath0 antiferromagnetic isotropic heisenberg ( afh ) chain . in the ground state of the afh chain , this order may be viewed as made up of ( not necessarily closely ) bound @xmath74 dipoles interspersed among the 0 s , forming what has become known as an af spin fluid .",
    "the order parameter that identifies this type of order is the so - called string order parameter @xcite , @xmath153 s^{z}_{\\ell }                      \\right\\rangle , \\ ] ] where the brackets indicate expectation value in the ground state . in the gapped , haldane phase of the afh chain as well as in the disordered flat phase of the models in @xcite one",
    "has @xmath154 .    from what we said above",
    "it is clear that the string order is just the kind of order we expect to observe in the flat phase of our model .",
    "we have thus calculated the steady state expectation value of the string order parameter ( [ sop ] ) with @xmath155 and @xmath156 , the maximum distance in a ring geometry , and the results appear in fig .",
    "our extrapolations did not perform well for this set of data , and are not showed in this figure .",
    "the general trend , however , is quite clear : above the critical point , @xmath112 , @xmath157 strongly tends to zero , while for @xmath158 we have @xmath159 . the point @xmath152 is special , for at @xmath152 the completely flat surface becomes an absorbing state and @xmath160 exactly at this point . as @xmath73 grows from zero ,",
    "the af spin fluid begins to form and @xmath157 grows accordingly , until at @xmath76 the asymmetry in the diffusion rates for the particles disrupts this af spin fluid structure , ordered domains begin to prevail and the string order vanishes .",
    "we then see that the string order parameter clearly reveals the mechanism of the roughening transition as the unbounding of the fluid antiferromagnetic pairs in favor of the formation of ordered domains .",
    "in summary , we carried out a finite - size scaling study of the roughening transition in a class of one - dimensional rsos models which also presents spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "we found that at the critical point @xmath161 the transition occurs with a dynamic exponent compatible with that of the directed site percolation process , for which we have the estimate @xmath162 , and that above @xmath86 there is a critical rough phase most probably with kpz exponents .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to calculate a second exponent from our diagonalizations",
    ". this might be due to the nonhermiticity of the operator @xmath34 , which might have caused an unusual nonmonotonicity in the values of the gaps with the parameter @xmath73 , thus preventing us from obtaining @xmath81 .",
    "this lack of monotonicity has already been reported in the literature @xcite , where it has also been noticed the slow convergence of the finite - size data towards the infinite volume limit .",
    "the order parameter @xmath133 was found to vanish like @xmath135 for @xmath134 with an exponent @xmath138 , in agreement with previously found values of @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the string order parameter revealed that the flat , gapped phase of the model is a disordered phase analogous to a haldane phase , with the stationary state presenting an antiferromagnetic spin - fluid structure of kinks , although dominated by the completely flat surface with no such a structure .",
    "the roughening transition may thus be understood in the links representation as the unbounding of the fluid antiferromagnetic pairs in favor of the formation of ordered domains , which then begin to blend together providing the surface with a finite growth velocity .",
    "it is possible to push further the investigation of this class of models in one definite way .",
    "the idea is to allow for an explicit break of the symmetry in the set of rates eq .",
    "( [ gammas ] ) by the following artifact @xcite . in the particle scenario ,",
    "we double the number of sites , introducing between two successive links @xmath163 a noninteracting flag variable @xmath164 taking two possible values , call them  @xmath149 and  @xmath150 .",
    "this variable will mimic the pseudospin @xmath165 .",
    "we then allow the rates of our modified model to be parametrized by , besides @xmath73 , a chiral symmetry breaking field @xmath166 $ ] such that now the rates depend on the quantities @xmath167 according to @xmath168 and @xmath169 , the roles of @xmath170 and @xmath171 interchanged whenever @xmath172 for a given @xmath173 . for example ,",
    "@xmath174 and @xmath175 , but @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the choice of which combination of values of @xmath178 s in the new rates will pick a @xmath170 or a @xmath171 with respect to the original rates is immaterial , for letting @xmath179 exchange their roles . for",
    "this process one may look at the order parameter @xmath180 to see whether one finds a spontaneously symmetry - broken phase .",
    "it may happens that for some values of the field @xmath181 one gets spinodal points , and that these points are associated with unusual dynamic exponents , e.g.  @xmath182 , once they have already appeared in one dimensional driven diffusive systems @xcite .",

    "<S> we carried out a finite - size scaling analysis of the restricted solid - on - solid version of a recently introduced growth model that exhibits a roughening transition accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic critical exponent of the model was calculated and found to be consistent with the universality class of the directed percolation process in a symmetry - broken phase with a crossover to kardar - parisi - zhang behavior in a rough phase . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter of the roughening transition together with the string order parameter was calculated , and we found that the flat , gapped phase is disordered with an antiferromagnetic spin - fluid structure of kinks , although strongly dominated by the completely flat configuration without kinks . a possible interesting extension of the model is mentioned . </S>"
