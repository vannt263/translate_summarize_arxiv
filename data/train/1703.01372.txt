    ", we will investigate the nonequilibrium early time evolution of quark and gluon matter in the longitudinally expanding geometry of an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision by numerically solving the boltzmann equation with an overoccupied glasma initial condition .",
    "such a study was previously performed bose enhancement factor that is essential to match the classical yang - mills simulations to kinetic theory  @xcite .",
    "] by kurkela and zhu  @xcite , who implemented the effective kinetic theory of arnold , moore and yaffe  @xcite including both elastic scattering and soft splitting processes .",
    "they however restricted their simulations to include only gluons .",
    "further , their focus was to follow the evolution of the glasma all the way to thermalization _ a la _ the bottom - up scenario .",
    "our interest here is primarily the classical stage of the glasma and we will perform simulations for a wider range of couplings than those presented in @xcite .",
    "firstly , by including only elastic processes , we will investigate how well these kinetic studies reproduce the self - similar scaling behavior of the gluon distribution , that has been obtained by the classical - statistical simulations .",
    "we will employ the small angle approximation to the boltzmann equation whereby , as shown by landau  @xcite , the collision integral is approximated by a fokker - planck like diffusion term .",
    "we will demonstrate that a flow of gluon number to the infrared ( ir ) generates an ir enhancement that often interpreted as a transient bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the literature .",
    "we will present results for both the longitudinal _ and _ transverse momentum distributions as well as the behavior of @xmath2 , demonstrating the influence of this ir enhancement .",
    "we should emphasize at the outset that the ir enhancement is unlikely to capture key features of bec formation as studied and quantified in detail for identical overoccupied conditions in scalar theories off - equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the generation of such an ir enhancement is unsurprising for a system of overoccupied gluons , as argued in a number of papers  @xcite .",
    "what is surprising is that , when the bec becomes manifest , our results reproduce important qualitative features of the classical - statistical simulations of the glasma .",
    "if inelastic scattering processes played a large role at these early times , a bec would never form and would not influence the dynamics of the glasma .",
    "our results therefore suggest that , at least for the range of weak couplings studied , inelastic processes may not be sufficiently strong at early times to hinder the formation of a transient bec .",
    "we emphasize that our framework does not provide a first principles solution to some of the puzzling dynamics of the glasma that we listed .",

    "both inelastic scattering processes and late time plasma instabilities , whose dynamics is in principle contained in the classical - statistical simulations , appear to be suppressed in the early - time evolution of the overoccupied glasma .",
    "our results therefore argue for a deeper understanding and characterization of the ir dynamics in the glasma .",
    "key features of this dynamics are captured by the spatial string tension , which has a characteristic time dependence  @xcite that is universal  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the spatial string tension sets the scale for off - equilibrium sphaleron transitions  @xcite ; this latter quantity is essential for dynamical simulations  @xcite of the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "the other novel feature of our study is the kinetic description of quark distributions in the expanding glasma .",
    "the landau kinetic equations were studied for an isotropic distribution of overoccupied gluons along with quarks and anti - quarks @xcite ; our work extends this study to the expanding glasma .",
    "we will show that quark distributions in the glasma also obey self - similar scaling distributions with the same dynamical scaling exponents as those satisfied by the gluons . in an accompanying paper",

    "however these estimates were made without the benefit of detailed kinetic simulations of the _ expanding _ glasma and assumed a constant value of @xmath2 even for weak couplings .",
    "this constant value for the anisotropy was disfavored by classical - statistical simulations .",
    "it is therefore perhaps ironic that an effective bec description of the classical stage of the glasma survives in a qualitative comparison of our effective kinetic description and the full classical - statistical yang - mills simulations",
    ". it will be important in future to quantify this comparison and understand better how bec formation is influenced by @xmath3 processes at weak coupling .",
    "we note that for self - interacting scalar theories , the existence of a bec is firmly established , for the same expanding geometry as the glasma  @xcite .",
    "a big puzzle discussed in @xcite was why the simulations of scalar theories showed identical universal behavior to that of the glasma .",
    "a conventional kinetic description of a scalar theory would not capture its dynamics .",
    "in contrast , an effective kinetic description with scattering , albeit with couplings modified by infrared dynamics , reproduces the infrared behavior in numerical simulations in a controlled fashion  @xcite .",
    "this is similar to our bec+scattering effective description albeit it should be noted that our bec will not capture important features of the ir dynamics in the scalar case .",
    "it is challenging to perform controlled computations of infrared dynamics in a gauge theory as have been performed for a scalar theory , or even interpret this ir dynamics definitively as a bec .",
    "however , as we noted previously , recent computations of the spatial string tension in the glasma  @xcite provide an essential guidepost for future studies .",
    "the other key result of this paper was the first numerical simulation of the temporal evolution of quark distributions in the expanding overoccupied glasma .",
    "we showed that light quark flavors obey identical scaling distributions to those of gluons .",
    "quarks however take longer to achieve the scaling behavior because their effective interactions are weaker than those of gluons .",
    "the scaling results have already been employed to estimate the photon yield in the glasma  @xcite ; our results there showed that photon yields from the glasma are significant relative to those from the thermalized qgp .",
    "we also studied the rate at which chemical equilibration is achieved .",
    "this result is sensitive to the initial quark occupancies .",
    "for maximal initial quark occupancies , chemical equilibration is approached rapidly ; it remains to be seen how inelastic collisions which become influential for times @xmath165 modify this result .    as an outlook for future work",
    ", it will be important to perform more detailed comparisons of our effective kinetic framework both with classical - statistical yang - mills simulations and kinetic simulations in the bottom - up framework that include inelastic scattering contributions .",
    "these comparisons are relevant both for our results for @xmath4 and at @xmath166 .",
    "further , a deeper theoretical understanding of our results , in the context of the puzzles outlined is desirable .",
    "a useful guide is the body of work employing two - particle irreducible @xmath167 techniques that have proved powerful in the context of scalar theories  @xcite .",
    "these also provide guidance in the extrapolation of weak coupling techniques to couplings relevant for heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that in our discussion of photon yields in @xcite , we did not consider the contribution to photon production from the interaction of quarks with the bec .",
    "such a possibility was discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "it will be useful to reconsider the possible effects of a transient bec in this context , and in other contexts , such as for instance the intriguing results  @xcite on hanbury - brown  twiss correlations from the alice experiment at the lhc  @xcite .",
