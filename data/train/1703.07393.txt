    "driven by recent advances in cyber - physical systems , control synthesis for large - scale network dynamic systems has become an increasingly prevalent topic in the control and network communities @xcite .",
    "physical networks such as power systems , wireless sensor networks , or the recently emerging internet - of - things consist of numerous heterogeneous subsystems that may be defined across complex topologies and wide geographical spans .",
    "the typical number of subsystems in these networks can scale from thousands to millions , making the design of tractable control mechanisms very challenging . to tackle the curse of dimension ,",
    "traditional model reduction - based techniques such as singular perturbations @xcite , balanced truncation @xcite , and controller reduction @xcite have been developed decades ago to facilitate the analysis and control of large - scale systems , in general .",
    "however , these techniques are not readily applicable to networks as their control schemes are mostly unstructured , and hence agnostic of the network topology that contains important constraints for both design and implementation .",
    "one such pertinent constraint is communication .",
    "for example , conventional feedback controllers such as @xmath0 optimal controllers are defined over unstructured dense transfer matrices , and thus implementing this control would necessitate an impractically large number of communication links for even a moderately sized network .",
    "starting from the idea of decentralized control by siljak @xcite , several seminal papers have developed design tools to impose desired implementation structure on controllers .",
    "one of them , the work in @xcite , states that a decentralized optimal control admits a convex reformulation in youla domain if the structural constraint on the controller is quadratic invariant ( qi ) under the plant model .",
    "built around quadratic invariance , papers including @xcite , @xcite and @xcite incorporate sparsity structures in the controller , aiming to reduce the communication density and to cope with delays .",
    "the restriction of these designs , however , is that the sparsity pattern meeting the qi condition is highly dependent on the sparsity of the open - loop network , and therefore , the choice of sparsity can be limited .",
    "moreover , the design complexities of these controllers are dictated by the order of the open - loop plant , and thus can become unscalable for very large - scale networks .",
    "a suboptimal design is proposed in @xcite to generalize the choice of sparsity structure by relaxation algorithms using @xmath1-weighted norm .",
    "the design , however , is still computationally demanding .",
    "motivated by these challenges , in this paper we present a hierarchical @xmath0 control framework that not only facilitates implementation , but is also generic enough to consummate conventional model and controller reduction techniques that allow for the design complexity to reduce significantly .",
    "the implementation mechanism of the proposed controller is as follows .",
    "selected network subsystems send their output measurements to a designated set of coordinators .",
    "these coordinators take the average of these measurements , and exchange the information between themselves to generate a @xmath0 control law .",
    "each coordinator , thereafter , broadcasts this control signal to its respective set of nodes",
    ". the overall execution is , therefore , completely hierarchical .",
    "fundamental work incorporating this hierarchy has been proposed in our recent paper @xcite for a lqg controller built upon the idea of clustering based projection . however , the design there is restricted by the choice of certain design parameters that guarantee closed - loop stability . in this paper",
    "we formalize the design in @xcite into a general @xmath0 control problem , where such restrictions do not exist .",
    "the hierarchical structure is proven to meet the qi condition irrespective of the structure of the plant , as a result of which , the control problem is reformulated as a standard unconstrained @xmath0 control .",
    "the controller preserves the hierarchical structure inside its input and output matrices , and enables us to simplify its design using conventional unstructured model and controller reduction techniques such as approximate solutions of the underlying algebraic riccati equations ( are ) , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the resulting controller , therefore , achieves simplifications in both design and implementation .",
    "the recent paper @xcite also addresses both goals using receding - horizon control , but the scalability of their controller is subject to the sparsity structure of the open - loop network .",
    "related hierarchical designs have been proposed in @xcite , however , they do not exploit the benefit of convex reformulation provided by quadratic invariance .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section defines the hierarchical constraint , and formulates the problem of hierarchical @xmath0 control .",
    "the same problem is parameterized and reformulated into an unconstrained @xmath0 control via quadratic invariance in section .",
