    "the structure of singularities formed in the gravitational collapse of bounded matter distributions is a widely investigated problem in general relativity . the question of whether such singularities are naked , i.e. , visible to far - away observers , or whether on the contrary they are safely hidden inside a black hole , has been the subject of innumerable works in the physical and mathematical literature .",
    "the problem remains poorly understood , even in the idealized case in which the collapsing body is spherically symmetric .",
    "a satisfactory solution is available for the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric dust cloud and can be found in the pioneering works by oppenheimer - snyder  @xcite and christodoulou  @xcite .",
    "( in  @xcite christodoulou analyses the question of existence and stability of naked singularities in the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field . notwithstanding the importance of the results in  @xcite , our focus is on matter models that describe material bodies , such as perfect fluids and kinetic particles  @xcite .",
    ")    the oppenheimer - snyder model consists of a collapsing spatially homogeneous and isotropic dust interior , described by the contracting friedmann - lematre solution , matched at a comoving boundary with a schwarzschild exterior .",
    "dropping the homogeneity assumption of the interior leads to the class of lematre - tolman - bondi solutions .",
    "these inhomogeneous stellar models were studied numerically by eardley and smarr  @xcite , and analytically by christodoulou  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in contrast to the case studied by oppenheimer and snyder , the spatially inhomogeneous collapse leads to the formation of naked singularities .",
    "see the prologue of  @xcite for an historical review on the gravitational collapse problem in general relativity .    in this paper",
    "we initiate the study of the gravitational collapse of matter subject to diffusion .",
    "we believe that the inclusion of diffusion dynamics in the gravitational collapse problem is meaningful both from a mathematical and physical point of view .",
    "from one hand it is well known that diffusion terms introduce a regularizing effect in the equations , which might prevent the formation of naked singularities in general relativity . on the other hand",
    "the physical relevance of diffusion phenomena is unquestionable and the applications in general relativity have been discussed extensively in  @xcite .",
    "we begin our study with the simplest possible model , namely a spherically symmetric dust cloud undergoing diffusion in a cosmological scalar field . in this case",
    "the regularizing effect due to diffusion is overwhelming : the interior of the dust cloud is forced to be spatially homogeneous . by this fact",
    "one can easily infer that , in contrast to the diffusion - free scenario described above , naked singularities can not form in the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric dust cloud in the presence of diffusion .",
    "another interesting property of our model is that , in contrast to the diffusion - free case  @xcite , the exterior of the star can not be static .",
    "the simplest spherically symmetric solution of the einstein equations that can provide a suitable exterior region for our stellar model is given by a generalisation of the vaidya radiating metric which includes a variable cosmological constant ( the radiating version of the schwarzschild-(anti-)de - sitter family of solutions ) .    a detailed analysis of our model is given in the following sections .",
    "we conclude this introduction by outlining the diffusion theory of matter in general relativity .",
    "there exist two versions of this theory : a kinetic one  @xcite , which is based on a fokker - planck equation for the particle density in phase - space , and a fluid one  @xcite , which is the ( formal ) macroscopic limit of the kinetic theory . in the present paper",
    "we apply the fluid theory .",
    "we recall that the energy - momentum tensor and current density of a perfect fluid are @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the rest - frame energy density , @xmath2 the pressure , @xmath3 the four - velocity and @xmath4 the particle density of the fluid . the diffusion behavior is imposed by postulating the equations    [ mattereq ] @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the diffusion constant , which measures the energy gained by the particles per unit of time due to the action of the diffusion forces .",
    "the second equation entails the conservation of the total number of fluid particles .    by projecting   along the direction of @xmath7 and onto the hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath7 , we obtain the following equations on the matter fields :    [ mattereq2 ] @xmath8    the system   on the matter variables must be completed by assigning an equation of state between the pressure , the energy density and the particles number density . in this paper",
    "we assume that the fluid is pressureless ( dust fluid ) . as the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid is not divergence - free , see  , we have to postulate the existence of an additional matter field in spacetime to re - establish the ( local ) conservation of energy .",
    "the role of this additional matter field is that of the solvent matter in which the diffusion of the fluid particles takes place .",
    "the simplest choice is to assume the existence of a vacuum energy scalar field @xmath9 with energy - momentum tensor @xmath10 , which leads to the following einstein equations for the spacetime metric @xmath11 ( in units @xmath12 ) : @xmath13 the evolution equation on the scalar field @xmath9 determined by  , the bianchi identities , and the diffusion equation   is @xmath14",
    "throughout the rest of the paper we assume that spacetime @xmath15 is spherically symmetric .",
    "the particle number density @xmath16 and the four - velocity @xmath17 at each point @xmath18 are also spherically symmetric and satisfy  . under these assumptions",
    "one can cover an open neighborhood @xmath19 of the center of symmetry by a coordinate system @xmath20 such that the metric and the four - velocity take the form @xmath21 here @xmath22 are functions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the standard metric on @xmath25 .",
    "the center of symmetry is defined by the timelike curve @xmath26 .",
    "this coordinate system is called _ co - moving _ and it is defined up to a transformation @xmath27 of the time and radial coordinates .",
    "we assume that the interior of the star defines a region @xmath28 of spacetime covered by co - moving coordinates .",
    "in particular , we assume that there exist @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 within @xmath33 .",
    "the timelike hypersurface given by @xmath34 will be identified with the surface of the star . to identify the region @xmath28 as the interior of a star",
    ", we assume that the matter fields @xmath35 are no - where vanishing on @xmath28 .",
    "the freedom in the choice of the co - moving coordinates will be used to impose @xmath36 so that @xmath37 is the proper time of observers at rest with respect to the boundary of the star , and @xmath38 so that the comoving radius @xmath39 coincides initially , i.e. , at time @xmath40 , with the radius function of the group orbits .",
    "it will now be proved that , when the fluid is presurreless , the diffusion dynamics compel the interior of our model to be spatially homogeneous .",
    "we denote @xmath41 , @xmath42 , for any function @xmath43 , and similarly @xmath44 denotes the derivative of any function @xmath45 of one variable .",
    "let @xmath46 and let @xmath47 be a spherically symmetric solution of  - on @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath9 are functions of @xmath48 only and there exist a positive function @xmath49 and a constant @xmath50 such that @xmath51    equation   for @xmath46 reads @xmath52 , which together with the boundary condition   implies @xmath53 .",
    "hence @xmath54 , as claimed .",
    "equation   now reads @xmath55 moreover   implies that @xmath9 and @xmath4 are functions of @xmath37 only , related by @xmath56 the einstein equations   are : @xmath57 where the only non - zero component of the energy momentum tensor is @xmath58 .",
    "the last einstein equation gives @xmath59 where @xmath60 is an arbitrary positive function of the radial variable .",
    "substituting into   we obtain @xmath61 integrating with the boundary condition   we obtain @xmath62 where we denoted @xmath63 .",
    "substituting   and into   we obtain the equation @xmath64r^2 + 1-f^2(r)=0.\\ ] ] the latter implies that there exists a constant @xmath50 such that @xmath65 finally   entails that @xmath1 is a function of @xmath37 only .    from now on",
    "we assume that the interior fluid is pressureless . by rescaling the radial coordinate",
    "we may assume that @xmath66 , hence the spacetime metric in the interior of the star takes the robertson - walker form @xmath67 where @xmath68 for @xmath69 , and the equations  - reduce to the following .",
    "the conservation of the particle number density   gives @xmath70 , while @xmath71 satisfy    [ einsteineqs ] @xmath72    where @xmath73 .",
    "the initial data for the system   are given on @xmath74 and consist of a quadruple @xmath75 , with @xmath76 , such that the constraint equation   is satisfied at time @xmath40 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath77 in particular , the set of admissible initial data comprises a three - dimensional manifold , which we denote by @xmath78 . by a regular solution of   in the interval @xmath79 with initial data @xmath80 we mean a triple of functions @xmath81 , @xmath82 satisfying  - and such that @xmath83 , for @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 be the maximal time of existence of a regular solution with a given set of initial data .",
    "we say that the regular solution is global if @xmath87 .    for @xmath88 ,",
    "i.e. , in the absence of diffusion , the interior reduces to a dust cloud in a spacetime with cosmological constant @xmath89 . in particular , for @xmath88 and @xmath90 , the exterior must be schwarzschild , and we recover the well - known oppenheimer - snyder model  @xcite . the analysis of the latter model is greatly simplified by the fact that a closed formula solution is known for the einstein equations , see eg .  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , the general solution to the system   is not known , and so the analysis of the stellar interior in the presence of diffusion is more complicated .",
    "this analysis has been carried out in  @xcite , where a complete characterization of the qualitative behavior of solutions to the system   has been obtained using dynamical systems methods .",
    "the relevant properties for the present study are summarized in the following theorem :    [ theo ] the manifold @xmath78 of initial data can be written as the disjoint union of two three - dimensional submanifolds @xmath91 , @xmath92 such that    * for initial data in the submanifold @xmath91 , the corresponding regular solution of   is global and @xmath93 holds for all @xmath94 .",
    "we call these interior models  expanding \" . * for initial data in the submanifold @xmath95 , the corresponding regular solution of   exists only up to a finite time @xmath96 and @xmath97 as @xmath98",
    ". moreover there exists a constant @xmath99 such that @xmath100 we call these interior models  collapsing \" .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the scalar factor claimed in ( ii ) corresponds to the property proved in  @xcite that collapsing ( dust ) solutions behave like the friedmann - lematre diffusion - free solution in the limit toward the singularity .",
    "it implies that the spacelike singularity at @xmath101 is a curvature singularity , as the kretschmann scalar @xmath102 satisfies @xmath103 in particular , spacetime is inextendible beyond the spacelike hypersurface @xmath101 and no outgoing light ray can emanate from the singularity .",
    "we obtain the following important corollary :    there exist no naked singularities in the spherical collapse of dust clouds undergoing diffusion in a cosmological scalar field .",
    "we remark that the above result is independent of the spacetime exterior and applies to all collapsing models . in the absence of diffusion",
    "the formation of ( locally and globally ) naked singularities in the gravitational collapse of a dust cloud occurs for spatially inhomogeneous models , see  @xcite . in the present case",
    "the action of the diffusion forces prevents the formation of naked singularities by an explicit and compelling regularizing effect : it forces the dust interior to be spatially homogeneous .",
