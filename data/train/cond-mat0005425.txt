    "some ferromagnetic shape memory alloys were recently suggested as a general way for the development of a new class of the magnetic - field - controlled actuator materials that will allow control of large strain effect by application of a magnetic field .",
    "numerous candidate shape memory materials were explored including ni@xmath0mnga co@xmath0mnga , fept coni , and fenicoti during past few years .",
    "large magnetically driven strain effects are expected have to occur in these systems .",
    "references [ 8 - 24 ] contain a detailed information on this subject .",
    "up to date , the largest magneto - strain effects were achieved in ni - mn - ga ferromagnetic shape memory alloys [ 1 - 7 ] .",
    "the best results on the field - induced strain reported short time ago [ 2 ] never exceeded 0.2 - 0.3% strain value in a magnetic field of order 8 koe in martensitic state for nearly stoichiometric single - crystal samples of ni@xmath0mnga alloy . recently",
    ", several research groups [ 6,7 ] have reported on the observation of super - large more than 5% magneto - strain effect in some non - stoichiometric ni - mn - ga alloys close to that 5.78% value expected from the tetragonality aspect ratio of the martensite crystal lattice .",
    "new ni - mn - ga alloys showing giant magneto - strain effect display simultaneously few interesting physical effects and new behavior for some magnetic and mechanical properties which is very different from that earlier observed in ni@xmath0mnga with lower ( 0.3 ) magneto - strain effect .",
    "one the new non - stoichiometric ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga@xmath3 alloy has recently been studied in details .",
    "this alloy undergoes the martensitic transformation at about 35c@xmath4 from the l@xmath5 ordered heusler type cubic ( a = 0.582 nm ) crystal structure into a tetragonally distorted structure with crystalline lattice parameters : a = b=0.594 nm and c=0.562 nm .",
    "the martensitic phase is ferromagnetic one and internally twinned .",
    "it contains a mixture of twin variants twinned usually on @xmath6 planes .",
    "the orientation of their c - axes is nearly parallel to [ 100 ] directions of the parent cubic phase .",
    "tetragonal symmetry direction is simultaneously a single easy magnetization axis for each martensitic variant .",
    "very low 2 - 3 mpa compressive twinning stress along [ 100 ] directions needed to transform the multi - variant samples into a single - variant state has been found for ni - mn - ga alloys displaying giant field - induced deformation effect .",
    "it is much less than it was observed in some earlier studied alloys ( 15 - 20 mpa [ 8,9 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "new alloys which usually have very simple two - variant twinning microstructure and very low twinning stresses can be easily transformed between two single twin variants by application both the mechanical stress and the magnetic field through the mechanism of twin boundaries motion .",
    "for instance , fig.1 shows an example of giant 5% magneto - strain effect associated with the direct and reverse magnetic - field - induced transformation between two single twin variants in ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga@xmath3 sample . the magneto - strain value achieved in this new alloy is insufficiently less compared to the natural crystallographic limit 1-c / a = 5.78% expected for twinning in this material .",
    "the next fig.2 represents in situ observation of the transformation process between two twin variants of martensitic phase in the same ni - mn - ga sample through the mechanism of the magnetic - field - controlled twin boundary motion .",
    "these experiments directly confirm the magnetic - field - induced twinning as the main physical mechanism responsible for a super - large magneto - strain effect found in this material .",
    "simultaneously , some important steps were made during the past few years concerning the physical nature of the magneto - mechanical phenomena observed in ferromagnetic shape memory alloys .",
    "james and wuttig [ 4 ] developed the models based on a constrained magnetization orientation approach .",
    "ohandley [ 5 ] first included the rotation magnetization effects together with usual zeeman energy term into consideration .",
    "likhachev and ullakko [ 3 ] have developed a general thermodynamic approach based on the maxwell s relationships and derived the main magneto - mechanical equation representing both the magnetic and the mechanical driving force balance in ferromagnetic shape memory materials .",
    "the last model has been also successfully applied to explain quantitatively the results of experimental study of large magneto - strain effects in ni@xmath0mnga earlier obtained in [ 2 ] . in particular , according to our model estimation made in [ 3 ] a giant magneto - strain values can be achieved only in materials with very low ( 2 mpa ) twinning stress values .",
    "mechanical testing results obtained for giant magneto - strain ni - mn - ga samples have completely confirmed these estimations .",
    "the present report represents some experimental results and several new effects recently found in some non - stoichiometric ni - mn - ga alloys that are directly connected with their giant magneto - strain response .",
    "we also represent some new model background based on the magnetization free energy consideration that allows better understand its important role .",
    "naturally , this approach gives the same final equations derived in our preceding publications .",
    "finally , the model equations are applied to explain some new experimental results .",
    "perhaps , starting from a simplest physical idea first clearly formulated in [ 1 ] , it is generally believed that a large macroscopic mechanical strain induced by the magnetic field in some ferromagnetic shape memory alloys is usually realized trough the twin boundaries motion and redistribution of different twin variant fractions in a magnetic field . in this case , the main thermodynamic driving forces should have a magnetic nature and be connected with high magnetization anisotropy and significant differences in magnetization free energies for different twin variants of martensite [ 1 - 7 ] .",
    "it should be noted that some early models have considered each twin band as a single magnetic domain with a constant magnetization value and constrained magnetization direction .",
    "this approach predicted some unlimited linear growth of the magnetic driving force in a magnetic field applied . respectively",
    ", it was expected that one can easily obtain significant magneto - strain effects in ferromagnetic shape memory alloys trough the twin boundary motion simply increasing magnetic field value as high as needed .",
    "it has been understood later [ 5 , 3 ] that it is not so , because each twin band is not a single magnetic domain but should contain the multiple internal magnetic domain microstructure and typical expected for the uniaxial ferromagnet 180@xmath4 domain wall configurations . as a result , the local average magnetization inside of twins is not a constant and can be changed in a magnetic field due to both the magnetic domain wall motion and the rotation of magnetization .",
    "the most important conclusion following from this point of view is that the magnetic driving force can not be increased infinitely in a magnetic field but always limited its maximal value independent on the magnetic field and proportional the magnetic anisotropy constant .",
    "this value is low enough , so only the very soft ( in sense of twinning stress ) materials can be good candidates to show really high magnetic field induced strain effects .",
    "therefore , the investigation of magnetic properties is the first important task for the magnetic driving force calculation and understanding of the magneto - mechanical behavior of ni - mn - ga and similar type alloys .",
    "some results showing main magnetic properties of ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga@xmath3 in martensitic state are indicated in figs.3 - 4 .",
    "first , the magnetization behavior of a single variant of martensitic phase has been studied . for this aim the internally twinned sample was initially transformed into a single variant state by application of compressive stress @xmath7 and then hardly constrained without unloading in a special holder .",
    "such a procedure was needed to avoid the magnetic field induced motion of twin boundaries and resulting transformation between the different twin variants during the magnetization measurements .",
    "two magnetization loops displaying field dependence of the magnetization @xmath8 along the easy ( tetragonal symmetry ) axis and also along the hard magnetization direction @xmath9 are shown in fig.3 .",
    "different mechanisms of magnetization for easy and hard magnetization directions are expected , respectively .",
    "in particular , 180@xmath4 magnetic domain walls motion is expected to be the main magnetization mechanism for easy axis . so as , the rotation of magnetization without domain walls motion seems to be responsible for the magnetization behavior in a hard direction [ 5 ] .",
    "corresponding magnetization free energies can be calculated from these magnetization data as functions of the magnetic field applied as follows :    @xmath10    these results are shown in fig.4 .",
    "the energy of magnetic anisotropy defined as a difference of these free energies is also indicated on this plot .",
    "in particular , it can be easily found that the magnetic driving force responsible for twin boundaries motion is practically equal to the magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "for this aim one should also know the magnetization free energy in the multi - variant sate .",
    "its dependence on the relative volume fractions of different martensite variants is especially important .",
    "fig.5 , for instance , schematically shows a typical for some new ni - mn - ga alloys two - variant twin microstructure , orientation of easy and hard magnetization axes for both twin variants and also the magnetic driving force alignment that usually give the maximal value of the magnetic field - induced strain in this material . in this case of simple two - variant twinning geometry the easy magnetization axis of the first variant ( white area )",
    "is parallel to a magnetic field applied .",
    "for the second one ( gray color ) the magnetic field is applied in a transversal hard magnetization direction .",
    "further , both these variants are called axial @xmath11 and transversal @xmath12 , respectively . taking the specific magnetization free energies for both twin variants @xmath13 and @xmath14 found , for instance , from the experiment one can write the total magnetization free energy per unit volume of the material as follows :    @xmath15    therefore , due to magnetic anisotropy",
    "the magnetization free energy becomes dependent on the relative volume fractions @xmath16 and @xmath17 occupied by axial and transversal twin variants , correspondingly .",
    "according to our previous calculation of the magnetization free energies shown in fig.4 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "so , one can decrease from its maximal value at @xmath21 to the minimal one at @xmath22 moving the twin boundaries as indicated in fig.5 .",
    "the corresponding magnetic driving force moving twin boundaries along their normal directions can be found from the general thermodynamic rule as follows :    @xmath23 _ h=\\,g_t\\left ( h\\right ) -g_a\\left ( h\\right)\\ ] ]    therefore , a non - zero magnetic driving force responsible for twin boundary motion appears as a result of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of ni - mn - ga .",
    "this force is applied along the twin boundary normal direction and equal to a difference in magnetization free energies between the different twin variants .",
    "the magnetic driving force is dependent on the magnetic field applied and never can exceed its saturation level as shown in fig.4 .",
    "the maximal estimated value about of @xmath24 @xmath25 is achieved at @xmath26 for ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga@xmath3 alloy . similar way , twin boundaries can be also driven by the mechanical stress applied .",
    "the corresponding normal mechanical driving force as a function of the applied stress @xmath27 is known can be found as follows :    @xmath28    here , @xmath29 is the strain matrix associated with twinning transformation between two single variants of martensitic phase . in the @xmath30 reference system shown in fig.5 it is represented as a diagonal matrix as follows :    @xmath31    where , @xmath32 is the twinning transformation strain value that can be easily estimated from the martensitic phase lattice parameters data : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this is a maximal strain allowed by crystallography of twinning in ni - mn - ga .",
    "no general way has been found up to date that would allow calculate the macroscopic twinning strain as a function of driving force .",
    "nevertheless , one can expect that independently on the physical nature of these forces ( magnetic , mechanical , etc . )",
    "the same driving forces applied to twin boundaries must produce the same macroscopic deformation effects .",
    "this evident physical requirement or universality rule denotes that the macroscopic twinning strain must be some universal function dependent only on the driving force value and independent on the physical source of this force .",
    "so , in case of plane twinning both non - zero components of the strain can be written through a single universal function @xmath35 dependent on the normal driving force @xmath36 as follows :    @xmath37    using this equation one can represent both the mechanical and magnetic strain simply assuming @xmath36 to equal to @xmath38 or @xmath39 respectively :    @xmath40    and    @xmath41    it is not difficult to eliminate the unknown universal function @xmath42 from eqns.(7,8 ) and find that @xmath43 and @xmath44will take equal values if only the corresponding mechanical and magnetic driving forces are also equal .",
    "in other words :    @xmath45    for instance , in case of the uniaxial compressive stress @xmath46 the mechanical and magnetic driving forces become equal at :    @xmath47    this immediately gives the following important relationship :    @xmath48    which allows performing the quantitative calculations of the magnetic - field - controlled deformation effects in different ferromagnetic shape memory alloys by using the corresponding mechanical testing data . according to eq.(11 ) the deformation effect of a magnetic field is equivalent to some additional uniaxial compressive stress applied .",
    "this equivalent magnetic stress @xmath49 can be easily calculated from the eq.(10 ) . for this aim",
    "one needs only to know the magnetization properties of the material and use the magnetic driving force calculation data indicated in fig.3 - 4 .",
    "the maximal equivalent magnetic stress that can be developed in a magnetic field is at about 2.25 mpa in ni@xmath50mn@xmath2ga@xmath3 .    on the other side , according to results of the mechanical testing experiments shown in fig.6 the uniaxial mechanical stress required to transform completely ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga@xmath3 samples from one single variant of martensitic phase to another one through the stress - induced twin boundaries motion does not exceed 2.5 mpa . the maximal compression strain that can be achieved on this load is about 5.8% .",
    "therefore , due to very low twinning stress value recently found in some ni - mn - ga alloys the calculated magnetic stress is completely enough to achieve very high 5% magneto - strain value in these new materials .",
    "some calculation results that follows from our model consideration are presented in this section . in particular , fig.7 represents both the strain - stress hysteresis loop found from the experiment and also a set of model fitting curves corresponding to different values of twinning stress .",
    "simple fermi - like distribution functions were used as an appropriate fitting basis for analytic interpolation of the mechanical testing results .",
    "@xmath51    here , @xmath52 denote loading and unloading curves respectively . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are characteristic stress parameters that can be associated with the start @xmath55 and finish @xmath56 twinning stress values .",
    "the best fit between the model function and experimental data is achieved at @xmath57 and @xmath58 and indicated in fig.7 by the solid circle labelled line .",
    "additional mechanical hysteresis loops @xmath59 shown here were also simulated to study the effect of different twinning stress values on the magneto - strain behavior .",
    "the corresponding model calculation results performed in accordance with eq.(11 ) and the experimental measurement data for the magnetic - field - controlled strain behavior in ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga@xmath3 are plotted altogether in fig.8 .",
    "as follows from these calculations the increase of twinning stress may cause the gradual decrease of the magnetic field induced strain from its maximal possible value 5.8% at @xmath60 to 2% at @xmath61 . in particular , one can observe the reasonable quantitative agreement between the 5.5% value expected from the model calculation and 5.2% experimental one .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the low twinning stress value is a very critical physical parameter controlling a super - large magneto - strain effect in ni - mn - ga .",
    "in particular , this can explain considerably lower magneto - strain effect found earlier in some nearly stoichiometric alloys which had at almost ten times higher@xmath62 twinning stresses .",
    "so , the magnetic driving forces ( that can produce no more than @xmath63 equivalent stress ) were only able insufficiently redistribute the relative twin variant fractions in these materials . as a result",
    "no more than 0.2% deformation effect was observed .",
    "the next fig.9 represents another important application of the model concerning one interesting physical effect that has been found in magnetization behavior .",
    "this effect is also directly connected with the magnetic - field - controlled twin boundary motion found in ni - mn - ga alloy .",
    "some very special magnetization hysteresis loop is observed if the magnetic field is applied to a single variant of ni - mn - ga alloy along its hard magnetization direction . at the initial stage",
    "the magnetization curve exactly coincides with a corresponding hard magnetization curve shown in fig.(3 ) . at higher magnetic field the sample is transformed by twinning until the second most appropriate twin variant with easy axis parallel to a magnetic field applied will be formed . during the next magnetic cycles the magnetization curve will always follow the easy magnetization path practically without any hysteresis .",
    "the quantitative calculation of this effect can be done according to the following magnetization equation :    @xmath64    that has been first found in [ 3 ] and can also be easily obtained in the framework of our present approach by using the well known thermodynamic definition :    @xmath65    and evident relationship @xmath66 between the strain and transformed fraction .",
    "resulting behavior of the magnetization can be found from the eq.(13 ) and previously calculated field dependence of the magneto - strain , assuming there @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "calculations were also done for different twinning stress values .",
    "this effect shows also a good agreement between the model and experiment .",
    "finally , one should make the following important conclusions :",
    "\\1 . a super - large deformation effect at about 5%",
    "that can be induced by application of magnetic field less than @xmath69 in some new ferromagnetic non - stoichiometric ni - mn - ga shape memory alloys seems to be the most interesting property of this material .",
    "ni - mn - ga alloys displaying giant field - induced deformation effects have always very simple practically two - variant twin microstructure . as a result",
    ", these alloys can be easily deformed by application of the low @xmath70 mechanical stress or magnetic field less @xmath69 through the mechanism of twin boundary motion .",
    "in particular , the reversible magneto - mechanical transformation cycle between two twin variants of martensitic phase can be induced by subsequent application of magnetic field along two different perpendicular directions .",
    "the magnetic driving force applied to twin boundaries is equal to a difference in magnetization free energies between the different twin variants of martensite .",
    "this difference also characterizes the energy of uniaxial magnetization anisotropy and can be calculated from the corresponding magnetization measurements .",
    "the magnetic driving force achieves its maximal value 0.13 mn / m2 in a magnetic field higher @xmath69 . in agreement with our earlier estimations and present model calculations",
    "this value is completely enough to explain high 5% magnetic field induced strain in some ni - mn - ga alloys which have the very low @xmath70 twinning stress .",
    "there is a definite analogy between the deformation effects caused by the mechanical and magnetic driving forces .",
    "for instance , in both cases the macroscopic twining strain driven by the mechanical stress or the magnetic field applied can be expressed through the same universal function dependent on the corresponding ( mechanical or magnetic ) driving force .",
    "this universality rule allows to perform the quantitative calculations of the magnetic field induced strain as a function of field by using the mechanical testing results .",
