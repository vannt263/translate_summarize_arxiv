    "finite - element - method electromagnetic simulations are used to deduce the level of optical localization and the relevant optical losses within the struture .",

    "the tuning properties of a double nanobeam photonic crystal are then computed to estimate the strength of the optomechanical coupling for the differential in - plane motion of the beams .",
    "we conclude with a comparison of the zipper cavity properties with other more macroscopic optomechanical systems , and a discussion of the future prospects for these sorts of chip - based gradient optical force devices .",
    "the optical design of the zipper cavity utilizes a quasi-1d photonic crystal structure to localize optical modes to the center of a nanoscale cross - section beam .",
    "there are a number of different , but related , design methodologies used to form low - loss optical resonances in such photonic crystal `` nanowires''@xcite . in this paper we utilize concepts based upon an envelope picture of the guided photonic crystal modes@xcite in the patterned nanobeam .",
    "we choose to work with `` acceptor''-type modes formed from the lower - lying band of modes ( the so - called `` valence '' band in reference to electronic semiconductor crystals ) at the brillouin zone boundary . in this way , the mode frequencies are as far away from the light line as possible , reducing leakage into the surrounding air - cladding of the nanobeam . owing to the optically thin photonic wires considered in this work ,",
    "the modes of predominantly in - plane polarization ( te - like modes ) are most strongly guided and are the modes of primary interest here . in order to form acceptor modes ,",
    "the bandedge of the valence band must be increased near the center of the cavity , and decreased in the mirror sections defining the end of the cavity .",
    "this is a result of the negative group velocity dispersion of the valence band modes@xcite .",
    "we have chosen to perform designs based upon thin films of silicon nitride , as opposed to higher refractive index materials such as silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) , for several reasons .",

    "a second reason is that lpcvd - deposited stoichiometric silicon nitride films on silicon have a large internal tensile stress , which has been shown to be critical in producing high-@xmath4 mechanical resonances in doubly - clamped nanobeams@xcite .",
    "an additional concern is the two - photon absorption present in smaller bandgap semiconductors such as silicon and gallium arsenide , which results in additional free - carrier absorption ( fca ) , and which can result in significant parasitic effects such as thermo - optic and free - carrier dispersion in small - volume photonic crystal nanocavities@xcite .",
    "silicon nitride , with its large bangap ( @xmath18 ev ) , requires three ( as opposed to two ) @xmath19 ev photons to be absorbed simultaneously , greatly reducing nonlinear absorption in the near - ir .",
    "an obvious drawback of using silicon nitride thin films , is the lower refractive index ( @xmath20 ) of these films in comparison to semiconductor films ( @xmath21 ) . as is shown below ( and in ref .",

    "the defect region in the structures studied here consists of a quadratic grade in the lattice constant of the linear array of air holes near the cavity center . in order to reduce transverse radiation loss , we choose to use a defect which supports an odd symmetry fundamental mode along the axial direction . since the valence band modes tend to have electric field intensity predominantly inside the high - dielectric region ( and nodes of the electric field in the low - dielectric constant air holes )",

    ", the optical mode will only sense the central half - wave displacement of the mechanical mode and the optomechanical coupling should still be quite large . as an example , from the intensity plot of the te@xmath38 fundamental bonded optical mode in fig .",
    "[ fig : optical_mode_profiles ] , the effective length of the optical mode along the long - axis of the nanobeams is @xmath171 @xmath3 m ( for @xmath172 @xmath3 m ) . the mechanical mode index @xmath99 is roughly equal to the number of half - wavelengths of the mechanical mode along the axis of the zipper cavity .",
    "therefore , for the zipper cavity of length @xmath93 @xmath3 m studied above , the @xmath173th order in - plane differential mechanical mode with @xmath174 mhz has a half - wavelength equal to @xmath175 @xmath3 m @xmath176 .",
    "the resulting optomechanical coupling of the @xmath121 mechanical mode to the te@xmath38 optical mode is then still relatively large , equal to approximately half that of the coupling to the fundamental @xmath95 mechanical mode .",
    "the optomechanical coupling factor to the te@xmath38 for each of the in - plane differential modes is tabulated along with the mechanical mode properties in table [ tab : mech_mode_properties ] .",
    "there are several physical ways of understanding the strength of the optomechanical coupling represented by @xmath107 .",
    "the per - photon mechanical force is given by @xmath177 .",
    "for the zipper cavity , this yields a per - photon force of @xmath178 , which at near - infrared wavelengths corresponds to @xmath0 pn / photon .",
    "such a force could be measured using other , non - optical techniques , and could provide a means for detecting single photons in a non - demolition manner .",
    "also , through the optomechanical coupling , intra - cavity light can stiffen@xcite and dampen@xcite the motion of the coupled mechanical oscillator@xcite .",
    "a perturbative analysis shows that in the sideband unresolved limit ( @xmath179 ) the effective mechanical frequency ( @xmath180 ) and damping rate ( @xmath181 ) are given by the following relations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath182    where @xmath157 and @xmath183 are the bare mechanical properties of the zipper cavity , @xmath184 is the time - averaged stored optical cavity energy , @xmath185 is the laser - cavity detuning , @xmath186 is the waveguide - loaded optical cavity energy decay rate , and @xmath187 .",
    "the maxmimum `` optical spring '' effect occurs at a detuning point of @xmath188 . for this laser - cavity detuning",
    ", a single cavity photon introduces a shift in the mechanical frequency corresponding to @xmath189 . for the zipper cavity , with @xmath190 , @xmath191 @xmath3 m , and @xmath192 n / m",
    ", the resulting single - photon mechanical frequency shift is approximately @xmath193 .",
    "thus , even a single cavity photon may yield a measurable shift in the mechanical resonance frequency .    .",
    "the nominal structure is indicated by the dashed green line . ]",
    "using photonic crystal concepts , we have designed an optomechanical system in which optical and mechanical energy can be co - localized in a cubic - micron volume and efficiently coupled through the gradient optical force . in the particular design studied here ,",
    "a `` zipper '' cavity consisting of two nanoscale beams of silicon nitride , doubly clamped and patterned with a linear array of air holes , is used to form the optical cavity and the mechanical resonator .",
    "mechanical oscillations consisting of differential motion of the doubly - clamped silicon nitride nanobeams results in an optomechanical coupling constant as large as @xmath194 , where @xmath13 and @xmath195 are the optical resonant cavity frequency and wavelength , respectively .",
    "this coupling is several orders of magnitude larger than has been demonstrated in high - finesse fabry - perot cavities , and is more than order of magnitude larger than for whispering - gallery micrototoid structures , both of which rely upon the radiation pressure force .",
    "finite - element - method ( fem ) simulations of the zipper cavity show that a structure with an optical @xmath190 , mechanical resonance frequency of @xmath196 mhz , and motional mass of @xmath197 picograms is possible . in the future , further increase in the mechanical frequency and reduction in the motional mass",
    "may be attained by using planar phononic crystals@xcite to form the mechanical resonator .",
    "the combination of phononic and photonic crystals would also provide an integrated , chip - scale platform for routing and coupling optical and mechanical energy .    beyond cavity optomechanics ,",
    "the zipper cavity may also find application in the field of cavity qed .",
    "in particular , the zipper cavity as described here is suitable for a broad range of wavelengths from the visible to the mid - infrared .",
    "the optical mode volume is made smaller by the sub - wavelength slot gap between the nanobeams@xcite , with @xmath198 for a slot gap of @xmath199 .",
    "as an example , one can imagine placing nanoparticles of diamond ( a popular solid - state system for quantum information processing@xcite ) in the gap between the nanobeams .",
    "such `` pick - and - place '' techniques have been used with other , larger , optical cavities with good success@xcite . in the zipper cavity case",
    ", the small @xmath200 would produce a coherent coupling rate with the zero - phonon - line ( zpl ) of the nv@xmath201 transition of approximately , @xmath202 ghz , even after accounting for the @xmath203 branching ratio for the zpl line .",
    "this is more than 100 times the radiative - limited linewidth measured for the nv@xmath201 transition ( @xmath204 mhz ) , and more than 10 times the theoretical zipper cavity decay rate ( @xmath205 mhz ) , putting the coupled system deep within the strong coupling regime .",
    "the additional benefit provided by the zipper cavity is the ability to rapidly tune the cavity frequency into and out of resonance with the zpl of the nv@xmath201 transition .",
    "if mechanical resonance frequencies could be increased towards ghz values , using the suggested phononic crystal concepts for instance , then new approaches to photon - mediated quantum interactions and quantum state transfer can be envisioned for solid - state cavity qed systems .",
