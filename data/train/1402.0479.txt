    "the kondo effect@xcite can be regarded as a paradigm for correlated many - body phenomena in quantum impurities . in the basic setup",
    "a localised spin is screened collectively by the spins of itinerant electrons in the surrounding bulk material .",
    "the thus formed non - trivial many - body state requires the application of sophisticated many - body methods for its theoretical description . by the mid 1980s the developments of such methods , including perturbative@xcite and numerical@xcite renormalisation - group ( rg ) techniques , fermi - liquid ( fl ) theory@xcite and",
    "the bethe ansatz,@xcite had uncovered the essential physics behind the formation of the kondo singlet , in particular the dynamical generation of a new , non - perturbative energy scale termed the kondo temperature @xmath0 .",
    "yet the kondo problem took a revival after it was realised@xcite that it can also be applied to describe transport experiments through quantum dots in the presence of strong coulomb repulsions , a regime which became experimentally accessible@xcite around the turn of the millennium .",
    "this in turn triggered much interest in the theoretical investigation of the transport properties of quantum dots in the kondo regime .",
    "there are essentially two different parameter regimes . in the first , at high energies compared to the kondo temperature , e.g. when the applied bias voltage @xmath1 and/or temperature @xmath2 is much larger than @xmath0 , the kondo singlet has not yet formed .",
    "the non - equilibrium transport properties can be studied perturbatively in the coupling between the dot and the leads for example using perturbative@xcite and functional@xcite rg methods or flow - equation techniques.@xcite in the second regime , when all external energies are much lower than the kondo temperature , @xmath3 , the kondo singlet is fully developed .",
    "the spin degree of freedom is frozen out and the dot influences the transport properties merely as a potential scatterer .",
    "this allows the application of fl theory , which in particular yields an expansion of the conductance through the dot for small temperatures and voltages encoded in the fl coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively.@xcite    the study of the crossover regime is naturally much more difficult .",
    "if the system is driven from the strong - coupling to the weak - coupling regime by increasing the temperature one can resort to standard non - perturbative techniques in equilibrium , in particular the bethe ansatz and the numerical rg method . both methods",
    "are well developed and exact up to numerical approximations , while the latter can also be applied very flexibly to different physical setups governed by kondo correlations .",
    "in contrast , if the driving is done by increasing the applied bias voltage the situation is much less understood . to overcome this pletyukhov and schoeller@xcite developed a real - time rg ( rtrg ) scheme , called @xmath6-flow since the laplace variable @xmath6 is used as flow parameter , which takes into account the generation of the spin relaxation rate and its feedback into the rg flow of the exchange coupling .",
    "this allowed the calculation of the differential conductance in the full crossover regime , which was found to be in excellent agreement with perturbative results at weak coupling , the exactly known fl relations , the temperature driven crossover behaviour obtained via the numerical rg method as well as recent experimental data.@xcite    another approach based on a slave - boson representation of the keldysh field integral was recently put forward@xcite by smirnov and grifoni .",
    "they obtained good agreement with both the numerical rg and rtrg results for the temperature and voltage dependence of the differential conductance respectively .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath6-flow scheme of the rtrg method it has already been possible to extend the analysis to finite magnetic fields.@xcite both approaches were applied so far to the spin-1/2 kondo dot or the corresponding single - impurity anderson model .    in this article",
