    "the classic 1935 paper of erds and szekeres @xcite published in _",
    "compositio mathematica _ was a starting point of a very rich discipline within combinatorics : ramsey theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "erds liked to call the main result of this paper the  happy ending theorem , \" as its discovery was triggered by a geometric observation of esther klein , and the authors collaboration with her eventually led to the marriage of klein and szekeres .    at the early stages of its development , ramsey theory focused on the emergence of large monochromatic _ complete _ subgraphs in colored graphs and hypergraphs . in the 1960s and 70s ,",
    "many initial results of ramsey theory were revisited in a more general setting .",
    "for instance , gerencsr and gyrfs @xcite proved that for any 2-coloring of the edges of a complete graph with roughly @xmath19 vertices , there is a monochromatic path of length @xmath4 .",
    "recently , figaj and uczak @xcite and , in a more precise form , gyrfs et al .",
    "@xcite have settled an old conjecture of faudree and schelp , according to which any 3-colored complete graph with roughly @xmath20 vertices has a monochromatic path of length @xmath4 .",
    "it follows from a theorem of erds and gallai  @xcite that for every positive integer @xmath9 there exists a constant @xmath21 such that no matter how we color the edges of the complete graph @xmath22 with @xmath9 colors , we can always find a monochromatic path of length @xmath4 .",
    "the smallest value of the constant @xmath23 is not known .",
    "the problem becomes simpler if we consider _ ordered _ complete graphs and we want to find a long _ increasing _ path such that all of its edges are of the same color .",
    "it follows from the results of erds and szekeres @xcite , and also from dilworth s theorem on partially ordered sets @xcite , that for any 2-coloring of the edges of a complete graph with more than @xmath24 vertices , one can find a monochromatic monotone path with @xmath4 vertices .",
    "an easy construction shows that this statement does not remain true for graphs with @xmath24 vertices . the result and its proof",
    "readily generalize to colorings with @xmath25 colors : in this case , we have to replace @xmath24 with @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding problems for hypergraphs are quite hard and their solution usually utilizes some variant or extension of the celebrated hypergraph regularity lemma .",
    "the only asymptotically sharp result of this kind was proved by haxell , uczak et al .",

    "a _ tight path _ or , shortly , a _ path of length _",
    "@xmath4 in @xmath28 is comprised of a set of @xmath4 distinct vertices @xmath29 and the set of @xmath30 hyperedges of the form @xmath31 where @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that no matter how we 2-color all triples of a complete 3-uniform hypergraph on @xmath32 vertices , one of the color classes will contain a path of length roughly @xmath4 . this result is best possible .",
    "it was generalized by nagle , olsen et al .",
    "@xcite , cooley , fountoulakis et al .",
    "@xcite , and conlon et al .",

    "using this notation for graphs @xmath39 , the corollary of the erds - szekeres theorem or the dilworth theorem mentioned above can be rephrased as @xmath40    for 3-uniform hypergraphs , a straightforward generalization of the cup - cap argument of erds and szekeres @xcite gives    [ erdos - szekeres ] let @xmath41 be the smallest integer such that for every @xmath42-coloring of all triples in @xmath8 $ ] , there exists a monochromatic monotone path of length @xmath4",

    "consider the following game played by two players , _ builder _ and _",
    "painter_. for @xmath63 , at the beginning of stage @xmath64 , a new vertex @xmath65 is added ( the vertices @xmath66 for @xmath67 already are present ) , and for each @xmath68-tuple of vertices @xmath69 with @xmath70 , builder decides ( in any order ) whether to draw the edge @xmath71 . if builder draws the edge , then painter has to immediately color it in one of @xmath9 colors @xmath72 .",

    "it follows from the definitions that    @xmath77    indeed , the first inequality comes from the following painter strategy .",
    "let @xmath78 be the @xmath79th vertex that builder adds in which there is an edge whose largest vertex is @xmath78 ( there may be vertices not given labels ) .",
    "that is , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the @xmath79th stage for which at least one edge is added .",
    "painter colors each edge @xmath82 with @xmath83 the same color as the color of @xmath84 in a @xmath9-edge - coloring of the ordered complete @xmath1-uniform hypergraph on @xmath85 vertices with no monochromatic path of length @xmath30 .",
    "all other edges , i.e. , those containing a vertex which is not the largest vertex in some edge , can be colored arbitrarily .",

    "therefore , this coloring has no monochromatic monotone path of length @xmath4 , and painter guarantees that there are at least @xmath86 edges when the first monochromatic monotone path of length @xmath4 appears .",
    "on the other hand , if builder selects all edges of a @xmath75-path ramsey ordered @xmath1-uniform hypergraph , she will definitely win ; which proves the second inequality .",
    "the third inequality is trivial , taking into account that the ordered complete @xmath1-uniform hypergraph @xmath36 with @xmath87 is @xmath75-path ramsey .",
    "conlon , fox , and sudakov @xcite used online ramsey numbers to give an upper bound for the ramsey number of a _ complete _ @xmath1-uniform hypergraph with @xmath4 vertices . here",

    "more precisely , we show    [ alternativeupperbound ] for every @xmath88 and for every @xmath89 , we have @xmath90    in the special case @xmath62 , this bound is worse than the upper bound in theorem [ main1 ] . however , theorem [ alternativeupperbound ] is already useful for @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , any improvement on the upper bound in theorem [ main2 ] for @xmath62 , together with the trivial upper bound on @xmath92 in ( [ trivial123 ] ) , will lead to analogous improvements for all larger @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if , for fixed @xmath9 , we would know that @xmath93 , then using theorem [ alternativeupperbound ] we would also know that @xmath94 .",
    "note that the recursive bound in theorem [ upineq ] does not give such an improvement even if we knew that @xmath95 is exponential in @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , the stepping - up lower bound in theorem [ stepup4 ] shows that any improvement on the lower bound in theorem [ main2 ] for @xmath62 will lead to analogous improvements for all larger @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to being useful for bounding classical ramsey numbers as discussed above , online and size ramsey numbers are now well - studied topics in their own right .",

    "the study of these numbers was initiated by erds et al .",
    "a fundamental problem of erds in this area is to determine the growth of the size ramsey number of paths .",

    "in contrast , rdl and szemerdi @xcite disproved a conjecture of beck by showing that there are graphs of maximum degree @xmath99 whose size ramsey number grows superlinear in the number of vertices . in the other direction ,",
    "kohayakawa et al .",
    "@xcite recently showed that graphs on @xmath4 vertices with fixed maximum degree @xmath34 have size ramsey number at most @xmath100 .",
    "another online ramsey game which is quite close to ours was introduced independently by beck @xcite and kurek and ruciski @xcite . in this game , there are two players , builder and painter , who move on the originally empty graph with an unbounded number of vertices . at each step",

    "a basic conjecture in this area due to rdl is to show that @xmath103 .",

    "randomized variants of the edge online ramsey number were studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that the problem of estimating @xmath73 and @xmath76 is most interesting in the case of graphs ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "indeed , for larger @xmath1 , @xmath10 grows roughly @xmath107-fold exponential in @xmath17 , so the lower and upper bounds on these numbers are roughly determined by @xmath10 .",
    "we will therefore focus our attention on the interesting case @xmath106 .    in view of ( [ trivial123 ] )",
    ", one may think that the functions @xmath73 and @xmath76 can not differ too much . rather surprisingly , already for graphs ( @xmath106 ) this is not the case . in section  [ sectionsizeandvertex ] , we show that the size ramsey number satisfies @xmath108 . on the other hand ,",
    "also in that section we prove    [ keyonlinethm ] we have @xmath109 and for every fixed @xmath14 , there are constants @xmath110 and @xmath111 such that @xmath112    moreover , the proof of theorem [ keyonlinethm ] shows that builder has a winning strategy which uses @xmath113 vertices and each vertex @xmath114 belongs to at most @xmath115 edges @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",
    "this theorem shows that , by using the information on the initial portion of the coloring , builder can substantially reduce the number of edges that guarantee a monochromatic monotone path .      in the last section ,",

    "in other words , there exists a sequence @xmath134 such that all ordered triples induced by the sets @xmath135 are of the same color .",
