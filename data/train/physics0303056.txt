    "the study of the spin polarization of photoelectrons is important primarily on two counts .",
    "firstly , since this effect originates from purely relativistic interactions , its behavior provides insights into relativistic aspects of the dynamical correlation which are inaccessible by conventional studies of cross section and angular distribution ; in the photoionization of lighter atoms , which may normally seem tractable by a non - relativistic approach , sizable resonance features in spin polarization spectra of emerging electrons can be found when relativistic forces are included@xcite . secondly , spin resolved spectroscopic measurements in conjunction with cross section and angular distribution data provide a comprehensive methodology to _ completely _ characterize the photoionization process@xcite . as a virtual beginning of the interest in the field ,",
    "the emission of highly spin polarized electrons over a limited range of the ejection angle near the cooper minimum of the photoionization cross section was predicted by fano many years ago@xcite . since then",
    ", the spin polarization of photoelectrons emanating from unpolarized atoms has been the subject of several theoretical and experimental investigations ( for reviews see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "however , the focus of all these studies has been the low photon energy range ( vuv and soft x - ray ) , over which it is a common knowledge that the electron correlation , in its complete form including interchannel coupling , is significant and often dominating .",
    "on the other hand , at photon energies far away from the ionization threshold , it was believed until recently that the independent particle ( ip ) framework , which completely disregards electron correlation , can adequately describe the photoionization process@xcite . however , over a series of combined experimental and theoretical studies this notion has recently been corrected for the cross section and the angular distribution asymmetry parameter@xcite .",
    "interchannel coupling has been shown to be a crucial determinant of the quantitative accuracy of these parameters in the intermediate and the high energy regime for photoelectrons emitted from both inner and outer atomic subshells . from a perturbative perspective",
    ", the effect originates from the correction to the single channel matrix element from a continuum configuration interaction among all neighboring channels@xcite . since the dynamical difference among relativistic ( spin - orbit ) channels arising from a given subshell determines the spin polarization character of electrons photoejected from that subshell , it is of particular interest to examine how the spin polarization parameters are affected by correlation in the form of interchannel coupling mechanism . in this paper , we focus on this aspect by investigating the spin polarization parameters of the valence 2p photoelectrons from atomic ne .",
    "the relativistic - random phase approximation ( rrpa)@xcite has been employed to perform the calculation .",
    "the rrpa calculation starts from an explicitly relativistic basis so that relativistic interactions are included _",
    "abinitio_. in addition to the ground state correlation , as well as two - electron promotion in the residual ne - ion core , rrpa incorporates interchannel coupling among _ all _ of the single excitation / ionization final state channels .",
    "we use a framework in which the coupling among selective members of the relativistic dipole - allowed @xmath0-coupled channels : @xmath1 can be chosen .",
    "the calculation has been carried out in both the length and the velocity gauge formalism ; the good agreement between length and velocity results , even at highest photon energy considered , indicates the numerical accuracy of our calculation .",
    "it may be mentioned here that rrpa has been used previously with reasonable success to study the spin polarization of photoelectrons from noble gases , but only in the low photon energy range@xcite .    in this calculation , we have considered the case where the target atom is unpolarized and the polarization of the residual ion is not observed .",
    "equivalently , the polarization of the target atom is averaged out and that of the residual ion is summed over .",
    "the dipole photoionization can then be _ completely _ described , in general , by a set of five dynamical parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , wherein @xmath2 is the partial cross section , @xmath3 is the angular distribution asymmetry parameter and the others are the photoelectron spin polarization parameters .",
    "these dynamical parameters can be expressed in terms of the reduced dipole matrix elements@xcite of the process .",
    "the explicit expressions for the spin polarization parameters corresponding to both @xmath7 and the @xmath8 photoelectrons of ne are given as @xcite    @xmath9\\times \\overline{\\sigma}_{2{\\mbox{$\\mbox{p}$}}{\\mbox{$_\\frac{3}{2}$}}}^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath10\\times \\overline{\\sigma}_{2{\\mbox{$\\mbox{p}$}}{\\mbox{$_\\frac{1}{2}$}}}^{-1}\\ ] ]    @xmath11\\times \\overline{\\sigma}_{2{\\mbox{$\\mbox{p}$}}{\\mbox{$_\\frac{3}{2}$}}}^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath12\\times \\overline{\\sigma}_{2{\\mbox{$\\mbox{p}$}}{\\mbox{$_\\frac{1}{2}$}}}^{-1}\\ ] ]    @xmath13\\times \\overline{\\sigma}_{2{\\mbox{$\\mbox{p}$}}{\\mbox{$_\\frac{3}{2}$}}}^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath14\\times \\overline{\\sigma}_{2{\\mbox{$\\mbox{p}$}}{\\mbox{$_\\frac{1}{2}$}}}^{-1}\\ ] ]    where , with the photon energy @xmath15 , the subshell cross sections are    @xmath16\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above equations we use the short - hand notations @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the reduced matrix element @xmath20 and the phase - shift @xmath21 respectively , corresponding to the @xmath22 dissociation channel .",
    "conventionally , additional parameters @xmath23 are also used which connect to the spin polarization of the total photoelectron flux@xcite .",
    "in order to uncover the details of how the interchannel coupling influences the photoelectron spin polarization dynamics we have performed five separate calculations for the 2p@xmath24 and 2p@xmath25 photoionization of ne with varying degrees of interchannel coupling . these are ( i ) no interchannel coupling among channels arising from different relativistic subshells , ( ii ) coupling of all channels from 2p@xmath24 and @xmath26 subshells , ( iii ) from 2p and 2s subshells , ( iv ) from 2p and 1s subshells , and ( v)from all four subshells together ( full calculation ) .",
    "since , in calculation ( i ) , we ignore all effects of interchannel coupling between channels arising from differing relativistic subshells , this is similar to the relativistic independent particle ( ip ) description , except that ground state correlations are included along with coupling among channels arising from the same subshell .",
    "an elegant approach to understand the relative importance of the coupling with different neighboring channels has been described in ref.@xcite in the spirit of a first order perturbation theory . under the influence of a perturbing degenerate channel @xmath27 the corrected wavefunctions @xmath28 for any dipole channel @xmath29 ( see eq.([channel ] ) ) from either of @xmath30 subshells",
    "are given , at the photoelectron kinetic energy @xmath31 , by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 s denote unperturbed wavefunctions , which are eigenfunctions of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath34 , and the final state total angular momentum @xmath35 has two dipole allowed values 5/2 and 3/2 .",
    "in eq.([ic_wave ] ) , the matrix element under the energy integration is the interchannel coupling matrix element with @xmath36 being the _ full _ hamiltonian of the system .",
    "now , defining the dipole photoionization matrix element for @xmath29 transitions with no interchannel coupling among channels arising from different relativistic subshells , corresponding to calculation ( i ) , as @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the ground state wavefunction and @xmath39 the transition operator , the corresponding perturbed matrix elements can be expressed as @xmath40    the correction term on the right side of eq.([ic_amp ] ) can be significant if two conditions are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "first , the spatial overlap between the perturbed and perturbing channel wavefunctions must be considerable to result in a significant interchannel coupling matrix element ; this is expected when the discrete wavefunctions have the same principle quantum numbers so that they occupy the same region of space and have significant overlap , and the respective ionization thresholds are close so that at high enough energies the electrons from both subshells have similar momenta , which enable the continuum wavefunctions to oscillate roughly `` in phase '' .",
    "second , the magnitude of the unperturbed matrix element of the perturbing channel is considerably larger than that of the perturbed channel .",
    "now the form of the energy integral suggests that the primary contribution of interchannel interaction will come from the values of the integrand at @xmath41 .",
    "importantly further , the electron continuum wavefunctions , participating in the energy integral , must be normalized per unit energy through a multiplication by a factor @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the leading energy behavior of the interchannel coupling matrix element in eq.([ic_wave ] ) turns out to be @xmath43 when the energy is high enough . evidently , considering eq.([ic_amp ] ) , if the uncoupled matrix element @xmath44 of channel @xmath27 decreases with energy slower by a factor @xmath45 or more than the corresponding decay of @xmath46 , the resulting effect of the coupling will be considerable , provided the interchannel coupling matrix element is significant .",
    "indeed , this leads us to expect a strong effect of the 2s channels ( with dirac - fock threshold 52.68 ev ) on 2p@xmath47 photoionization ( with thresholds 23.08 ev for @xmath48 and 23.21 ev for @xmath49 ) .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig.1 which gives our calculated results for the @xmath50 and the @xmath51 subshell cross sections in each of the five calculations described above ; at the highest energies , the cross section results are seen to essentially coalesce into just two curves - those including coupling between and those omitting that coupling form the other .",
    "this was noted previously in ref.@xcite where similar calculations were performed . because the high energy uncoupled photoionization cross section for an nl subshell falls off with energy as @xmath52 , the correction term in eqs.([ic_amp ] ) falls off in the limit of @xmath53 , as @xmath54)@xcite . as applied to the present case",
    ", the perturbation of @xmath55 by @xmath56 falls off as @xmath54 , the same as the falloff of the @xmath55 themselves , so that the perturbation is of the same order of size as the uncoupled matrix elements .",
    "the weak effect of 1s channels on either of 2p@xmath47 cross sections , as also seen in fig.1 , is owing to the much higher 1s ionization threshold ( 893.02 ev ) that results in poor overlap of the continuum wavefunctions in ensuing interchannel coupling matrix element , along with the fact that the discrete 1s and 2p@xmath47 occupy very different regions of space and , therefore , overlap poorly .",
    "in addition , what is rather interesting to note in fig.1 is the tiny effect from the coupling between the channels from the spin - orbit split 2p@xmath47 subshells .",
    "the curve ( thin solid ) corresponding to only-2p@xmath24 or only-2p@xmath25 channels ( calculation ( 1 ) , similar to the ip result ) differs very little in the lower part of the energy range ( fig.1(a ) ) when compared to the curve ( dotted ) from all 2p channels combined ; however , both the curves practically merge together at higher energies ( fig.1(b ) ) indicating virtually no effect from the coupling .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood as follows .",
    "it is true that the interchannel coupling matrix element between the 2p@xmath24 and 2p@xmath25 channels is strong due to the close proximity of their respective ionization thresholds .",
    "but since the high energy falloff of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the same , the ensuing coupling corrections ( eq.([ic_amp ] ) ) fall off effectively as @xmath43 at higher energy , explaining how the small coupling effect at lower energies becomes practically zero at higher energies .",
    "looking at our results for the spin polarization parameters , figs.2 through 5 , rather different phenomenology is evident ; significant effects resulting from the coupling between the channels arising from the 2p@xmath59 and 2p@xmath60 spin - orbit subshells are noted !",
    "understanding the underlying reason(s ) for this phenomenology is somewhat more complex than for the cross sections owing to the fact that the spin polarization parameters depend upon both the magnitudes _ and _ the phases of the dipole matrix elements , as seen from eqs.(2 - 4 ) .",
    "thus , an understanding of the modification of the phase shifts engendered by interchannel coupling is also of importance .",
    "starting from eq.([ic_amp ] ) and explicitly introducing the unperturbed ( @xmath61 ) and the perturbed ( @xmath62 ) phase - shift through the notations @xmath63(e')de'\\right )   \\times\\left|m_{{2p}_j}\\right|^{-1}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , as discussed above , sufficiently above the ionization thresholds the leading energy behavior of @xmath64 is @xmath43 . from eq.([ic_phase ] ) this indicates the decreasing effect of the coupling on the relative phase - shift going up in the energy .",
    "however , it is important to note here that this decay is much slower than @xmath43 due to the logarithmic nature of the correction  a behavior which bears some consequence in the interchannel coupling effects on the photoelectron spin polarization parameters .",
    "let us first focus on the effect of 2p@xmath25 channels on the spin polarization of 2p@xmath24 photoelectrons and _ viceversa _ ( dotted curves ) .",
    "we compare between the thin solid curve ( effectively the ip prediction ) and the dotted curve of each of the figs.2 through 5 .",
    "evidently , for all the spin polarization parameters the effect of this coupling is stronger at relatively low energies .",
    "this is clearly because the strength of the interchannel coupling matrix element decreases with increasing energy , as discussed above .",
    "but , as already made clear from the corresponding cross section results , this coupling does not strongly affect the magnitude of the 2p@xmath47 dipole matrix elements . and",
    "since their unperturbed phases are nearly equal , the coupling does not alter their phases much ( see eq.([ic_phase ] ) ) . as a consequence , our results ( not shown ) of the angular distribution asymmetry parameter @xmath3 , that depends on both the matrix elements and the phases , shows minimal effect of this coupling .",
    "but if the coupling affects neither the dipole matrix elements nor the phases significantly , how then can it affect the spin polarization parameters ?",
    "the answer lies in the fact that the values of the 2p@xmath47 spin polarization parameters arise from complicated combinations of the dipole matrix elements and their phases , eqs.(2 - 4 ) , resulting in significant cancellations , so that small differences in dipole matrix elements and phases can be magnified to produce the results seen .",
    "the fact that the non - relativistic limit of spin polarization parameters are zero while for the @xmath3 parameter it is finite and close to its relativistic value indicates that such a cancellation mechanism is indeed operative for the spin polarization parameters .",
    "for all of the spin polarization parameters , the result of this coupling , however , exhibits a rather slow monotonic tendency to converge to the corresponding effective ip - like prediction , with increasing energy , much slower than the convergence of the cross section .",
    "this is because the spin polarization parameters depend upon phase shift differences as well , and these were shown above to converge more slowly than the magnitudes of the dipole matrix elements .",
    "this was also seen earlier in connection with @xmath3 which also depends on phase shifts@xcite .",
    "further , note that this coupling induces in general a stronger influence on the spin polarization of 2p@xmath24 electrons than on that of 2p@xmath25 electrons , except for @xmath5 ( fig.3 ) where the results of both subshells have similar effect from this coupling .",
    "to provide some quantitative estimates , @xmath4 ( fig.2(a ) ) and @xmath65 ( fig.5(a ) ) for 2p@xmath24 electrons show respectively about 30% and 40% modification compared to the uncoupled results at roughly 300 ev photon energy ; as expected , these differences decrease gradually as the energy increases . on the other hand , @xmath6 for 2pelectrons ( fig.4(b ) , that is related to the corresponding @xmath3 simply through @xmath66 ,",
    "shows an almost negligible effect from this coupling .",
    "interchannel coupling of the 2p channels with either 2s or 1s channels involves alterations in both the magnitudes and phases of the 2p dipole matrix elements .",
    "coupling with the 2s channels affects the magnitudes of the 2p@xmath24 and 2p@xmath25 dipole matrix elements very strongly , as clearly indicated in fig.1 .",
    "but the phases are also strongly affected ( see eq.([ic_phase ] ) ) . with the 1s coupling on the other hand , while the modifications to the magnitudes of the 2p@xmath47 dipole matrix elements are already small , except in a very small region around the 1s threshold , the alterations of the 2p@xmath47 phase shifts are also small .",
    "but it is non - trivial to assess in which direction the changes in these dynamical quantities , the magnitudes and the phases of the 2p@xmath47 dipole matrix elements , will induce changes in the spin polarization parameters . for two of the spin polarization parameters , @xmath4 ( fig.2 ) and @xmath65 ( fig.5 ) , the effect of 2s and 1s coupling on 2p@xmath47",
    "ionization is certainly not as straightforward as in the case of cross sections where only the magnitudes of the matrix elements ( and not the phases ) are important .",
    "in addition , by virtue of the different functional dependence of the parameters on the magnitudes of the dipole matrix elements and phase - shifts , the qualitative behavior of the result changes from one parameter to another .    as seen in fig.2 , the effect of 1s and 2s coupling on 2p@xmath47 for the parameter @xmath4 are roughly complementary until about 900 ev photon energy , the position of 1s rydberg resonances ; as a result , the deviation between the dotted ( all 2p channels included ) and thick solid ( full calculation ) results remain approximately constant . beyond the resonance region",
    "the relative effect of 1s coupling drops off .",
    "however , over the entire energy range considered , the full calculation differs from the effective ip result ( thin solid curve ) .",
    "this difference is significant for 2p@xmath24 showing a maximum alteration of about 25% at 300 ev , while for 2p@xmath25 the difference is rather small .    for parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "on the other hand , the 1s and 2s coupling influence the result quite in the similar qualitative manner as they do for the cross section .",
    "along almost the complete energy range , albeit the near - threshold region ( where interchannel coupling is known to be important ) , @xmath5 for both 2p@xmath24 and 2p@xmath25 ( figs.3(a , b ) ) as well as @xmath67 @xmath6 ( fig.4(a ) ) suggest an almost steady coupling contribution of more than 25% over the corresponding effective ip prediction . for 2p@xmath25 @xmath6 ( fig.4(b ) ) , of course , the effect is small at lower energies which , however , increases gradually with energy to yield over 20% correction .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 ( fig.5 ) being a combination of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath6 exhibits a rather mixed behavior . for @xmath67 photoionization ( fig.5(a ) ) a maximum of 40% coupling effect is seen at around 300 ev that monotonically diminishes with increasing energy to eventually produce about 20% effect over the high energy range . for 2p@xmath25 ( fig.5(b ) ) the effect of the coupling , that is weak at low energies , rises steadily to reach a value of about 20% at the heighest energy considered .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate that , as in the case of cross sections and angular distributions , the effect of interchannel coupling on the photoelectron spin polarization is considerable .",
    "however , due to the sensitivity of the spin polarization to relative phase - shifts the results exhibit behavior that is qualitatively different from that of the cross section results . while for the cross section , the high energy interchannel coupling effect generically increases going from lower to higher photon energies , for most of the spin polarization parameters a strong coupling contribution appears already at low energies . as a consequence , a substantial coupling correction exists for these parameters over a very broad spectral range .",
    "furthermore , coupling with 1s channels , which influences the cross section only over a narrow range , extends its influence over a much larger energy range for the 2p@xmath47 spin polarization parameters owing to the much slower drop - off of the phase shift corrections induced by interchannel coupling .",
    "finally , we note that although we have illustrated the effect with an example of valence photoionization of ne , the same mechanism of configuration interactions in the _ continuum _ ( interchannel coupling ) must be operative for the spin - polarization of photoejected electrons from any arbitrary atom or atomic ion and from any subshell .",
    "it is shown in this paper that the photoelectron spin polarization of an atom is strongly influenced by the electron correlation _ via _ interchannel coupling over the entire spectral range .",
    "unlike to the cross section , where only the coupling - induced alteration of the magnitudes of matrix elements is responsible for the behavior , modification of the phase - shifts play an important role determining the effect on the spin polarization . for the cross section and the angular distribution the importance of interchannel coupling for energetic photoemission has been demonstrated previously@xcite . with the current result",
    "we conclude , therefore , that in order to acquire a _ complete _ knowledge of photoionization dynamics unambiguously over the range from vuv all the way to hard x - rays , theoretical study including the interchannel coupling is absolutely required .",
