    "at the root of foundations of mathematics lies the old debate between platonists , who feel that mathematical abstractions exist independently of us and only need to be called out , . ] and constructivists , who contend that it makes no sense to speak of what has not been explicitly constructed .",
    "modern origins of the debate arguably trace back to cantor and kronecker , and to the exchange between hilbert and brouwer ( see @xcite*[int : controversy ] ) . yet a couple of millennia earlier , ancient greeks have already underwent what may be seen as a multi - century debate on the meaning and significance of _ problems _ versus _ theorems_. in their words ,    the ancient foundational debate is well documented in both of `` the two main sources '' of available information on the history of greek mathematics ( cf .",

    "29 , @xcite*p .",
    "26 ) : the _ commentary _ on euclid s first book by the philosopher proclus @xcite , from which the previous quote is taken as well ; and the _ collection _ of the geometer pappus of alexandria @xcite ; as well as in other sources @xcite*p .  54 .",
    "thus , according to pappus , `` in the old times some said that all things are problems , while others said that all things are theorems '' ; proclus gives us considerable detail on the two positions ( see  [ ancient ] ) , and identifies the proponents of the former as the school of the geometer menaechmus and of the latter as the philosopher speusippus and a certain amphinomus .",
    "the reader may wish to compare these positions ( upon reading at least the most relevant excerpts , collected in  [ ancient ] ) , with those of hilbert and brouwer .    the `` conciliatory '' approach of kolmogorov",
    "would then inevitably be compared with the view adhered to by proclus and pappus themselves  who argued at some length that problems can be distinguished from theorems in a number of ways ( see  [ ancient ] ) .",
    "in fact , proclus and pappus are more or less clear on that their works are largely compilations of earlier sources ; in particular , proclus explicitly credits zenodotus and posidonius for some of the observations on the distinctions between problems and theorems , and it is widely thought that much of his talk on foundational issues ( including the passage quoted above , cf .",
    "@xcite*p .",
    "40 , ( 9 ) ) derives from a lost treatise of geminus ( which proclus also explicitly quotes a number of times ) .",
    "but in contrast to kolmogorov , the ancients went beyond the methodological / meta - mathematical observations and did produce a considerable body of actual mathematics , that ( as we will see in  [ modern ] ) does not fit within the modern framework of either classical or constructive mathematics , but involves their substantial interaction .    indeed , less than a century after speusippus and menaechmus , and a couple of centuries before posidonius and geminus",
    ", euclid wrote his _",
    "elements_. in the original greek text ( see @xcite ) , euclid had a common numbering for problems and theorems , but did not entitle them ( this is also confirmed by the oxyrhynchus papyrus , see @xcite ) .",
    "he also wrote no explicit cross - references ; thus he did not have any common name for problems and theorems , contrary to the tradition of calling them all `` propositions '' which is found in modern translations of the _ elements_. ( in fact , at least from 16th and up to the end of 19th century many editions of the _ elements _ provided more detailed headings of the form `` proposition x. problem '' and `` proposition y. theorem '' ; see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . )",
    "euclid stated problems in the infinitive ( of the aorist type ) , e.g.  _ to construct an equilateral triangle on a given straight line segment _ , and then in the course of the solution usually restated a specification of the problem with an explicit request added : _ so it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the segment ab_. theorems were , of course , stated in the indicative mood , which is one simple way of telling them unambiguously from problems .",
    "two other fairly syntactic ways were noted by proclus :    we will see in  [ euclidean ] that , firstly , this euclidean _ interweaving _ ( if understood as logical interdependence ) can be expressed in a fully formal way in terms of our qhc calculus ; and secondly , that this expression is only made possible as it stands by a rather simple logical structure of the geometric sentences considered by euclid ( more specifically , it matters here that what is given in a problem be of a simple logical form ) .",
    "let us note that _ theorems and problems _ , as discussed here , should not be conflated with _",
    "propositions and problems _ , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "theorems are propositions _ that are considered to have a proof _ ( symbolically , this corresponds to prefixing the proposition with @xmath3 ) , and problems in the sense of the ancients are normally the same as problems in the sense of kolmogorov _ that are considered to have a solution_. in some contexts , however ,",
    "solutions are not assumed to be known ( as discussed by pappus , see  [ ancient ] ) or may not exist altogether ( as discussed by proclus , see  [ ancient ] ) .      as pointed out by rodin @xcite ,",
    "the modern meaning of the word `` postulate '' ( @xmath4 ) is not quite what this word must have meant to the ancient greeks :    in fact , older translations of the _ elements _ often refer to postulates as _ petitions _ @xcite , @xcite ; and _ petitiones _ in latin @xcite , _ i _ in russian @xcite , _ forderungen _ in german @xcite , etc . actually , all major groups of medieval latin manuscripts of the elements ( adelard i and ii , campanus / ratdolt , and at least one version of boethius ) speak of _ petitiones _ , with _ postulata _ appearing perhaps only in the 16th century @xcite .",
    "now proclus also discusses several approaches to explaining the difference ( if any ) between euclid s axioms and postulates ( see  [ ancient ] ) .",
    "the view that he favors himself , and the one that is also of interest for us , is explicitly attributed by him ( several times , to be sure ) to geminus :    in euclid s text , postulates differ from axioms in grammar ( cf .",
    "while the axioms ( called `` common notions '' by euclid ) are assertions expressed in the indicative mood , the postulates are written in the infinitive , preceded by the common introduction : _ let it have been requested ... _ , which is the third person singular passive present perfect imperative of @xmath5 . ]",
    "for example , the fourth postulate reads : _ ... for all right angles to be equal to each other_. the first three postulates :    1 .   to draw a straight line segment from a given point to a given point ; 2 .   to extend any given straight line segment continuously to a longer one ; 3 .   to draw a circle with a given center and a given radius",
    "are phrased in the aorist infinitive , which is supposed to express a single or completed action .",
    "the main verbs of the fourth and the fifth postulates ( _ to be equal _ and _ to intersect _ ) are in the present infinitive , which is supposed to express an action in progress , continuing or repeated . in proclus , we read :    interestingly , in many editions of the _ elements _ published in 16 - 19th centuries , there are only three postulates , in accordance with the view of geminus ; see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , according to @xcite*p .",
    "171 , `` grynaeus s _ editio princeps _ [ the first printed _ elements _ in greek , published in 1533 , cf .",
    "@xcite ] had the fourth and fifth postulates attached to the end of the common notions [ ... ] the same ordering is found in simson s influential eighteenth - century euclid [ 1756 , cf .",
    "@xcite ] and many of the nineteenth - century english editions that were built upon it . ''    to summarize , we see that the explanation of the logical structure of euclid s _ elements _ according to zenodotus , posidonius and geminus has resonated with a sizeable proportion of the mathematical community for about two millenia  up to the end of 19th century . in this approach , the platonist and the constructivist that a geometer may find within herself are not irreconcilable enemies fighting for her soul  as the 20th century foundational debate effectively made us believe  but rather co - authors engaged in a continuous dialogue to mutual benefit : one being equipped with measurement devices , common notions about equality , and the method of _ reductio ad absurdum _ ; and the other with construction devices , such as ruler and compass .",
    "the tradition of intuitionism , and more generally constructive mathematics of the 20th century , has been to ban what they understood as `` the law of excluded middle '' , but tacitly retain most non - logical axioms of non - constructive theories ( with appropriate modifications ) .",
    "on the surface , our approach based on qhc looks entirely conciliatory : in qhc we do not prohibit arguments based on the law of excluded middle , but simply rebrand them as `` a different mode of knowledge '' .",
    "but on a closer look it is in some way even more radical .",
    "indeed , it is natural to move to the intuitionistic side of the theory _ those and only those _ axioms that truly ( whatever that means ) have the form of elementary constructions  and to treat them as postulates ( i.e.  as primitive constructions ) , just like euclid and geminus .",
    "while qhc admits application of axioms and theorems in problems , and of postulates and problems in theorems , due to the inference rules @xmath6 this does not produce `` pure '' problems from `` pure '' propositions , and vice versa  but only those containing the logical connectives @xmath2 and @xmath1 , which may well complicate matters .",
    "thus the validity of any logical inference involving both classical and intuitionistic sides of the theory does not automatically follow from the validity of its counterpart either in the purely classical analogue of the theory or in its purely intuitionistic analogue .",
    "thus , a theory over qhc obtained by typifying a classical theory @xmath0 may well be more restrictive in its purely classical fragment than @xmath0 , and , at least in principle , may be more restrictive in its purely intuitionistic fragment than a traditional constructivization of @xmath0 .",
    "thus our approach is in a sense a kind of _ ultra - constructivism _ ; it can be argued to capture more of hilbert s idea of a `` finitistic '' , intuitively justified proof than usual kinds of constructivism do ( compare @xcite*[g1:philosophy ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize that it is not at all clear how much of the principle of mathematical induction could honestly and meaningfully survive in the form of postulates ( see  [ certifiability ] for a brief preliminary discussion ) .",
    "we will describe one specific theory over qhc ( predictably , a theory of planar geometry ) in  [ tarski - beeson ] .",
    "a standard view , which goes back at least to the late 19th century and has been thoroughly criticised ever since ( see , in particular , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references there ) , but is still widespread @xcite is that differentiating between problems and theorems was simply the ancients way of speaking of what we now know as the existential quantifier . indeed , upon introducing a rather large number of sorts of variables and of primitive relations ( which seem to have been indeed treated as primitive by euclid ) , j. avigad et al .",
    "@xcite observed that all sentences found in the first four books of the elements are of a very simple logical form : @xmath7 in the case of theorems and axioms and the last two postulates , and @xmath8 in the case of problems and the first three postulates , where @xmath9 any @xmath10 are lists of variables ( of multiple sorts each ) , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are conjunctions of primitive relations and of negations of primitive relations ; in the case of theorems , @xmath12 can also be @xmath13 . here",
    ", for instance , `` two given lines intersect '' is taken among the primitive relations , and not explained in terms of the existence of a point common to the two lines ( even though the relation of a given point to belong to a given line is also taken as primitive ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is also clear that the ancients were not merely worried about existence of objects in plato s ideal world ( or in the sense of modern classical logic ) , but about their explicit construction .",
    "for instance , in his book iv , euclid shows how to construct regular 4- , 5- , 6- and 15-gons with ruler and compass , and says nothing of other regular @xmath14-gons  hardly because he doubted their existence .",
    "( some of them indeed can not be constructed with compass and unmarked ruler , as we now know . )",
    "many ancient geometers solved problems with a plethora of geometric tools more complex than ruler and compass , so they were certainly not obsessed with any fixed set of tools  but rather with the very idea of explicit construction .",
    "in fact , the following comments by philoponus and eutocius ( see @xcite ) make it clear enough that the ancients were well aware of the difference between existence and construction :    in fact , it appears that the logical distinction between construction and existence is explicitly attributed by proclus to posidonius ( see  [ ancient ] ) .",
    "moreover , the ancients notion of construction is very close to those of modern constructivists . indeed , while proofs by contradiction and by cases abound in the elements , it is almost explicitly asserted by proclus , with an attribution to geminus , that no construction relies on an argument by contradiction ( see  [ ancient ] ) ; and according to m. beeson @xcite , no construction in the elements relies on a distinction of cases , apart from problem 2 in book i. as for this problem i.2 , _ given a straight line segment @xmath15 and a point @xmath16 , find a point @xmath17 such that @xmath18 _ , euclid s construction does not work in the case where @xmath19 ; moreover , its output does not even converge to any limit as @xmath16 tends to @xmath20 .",
    "beeson found a different construction which works in all cases @xcite .",
    "proclus notes in connection with problem i.2 that whenever there is a case split , euclid normally considers only the hardest case and implicitly leaves the other ones to the reader ( which is indeed so in euclid s proofs of many theorems ) ; and then claims that in problem i.2 it is necessary to consider a number of cases , and gives constructions in some of them .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that euclid himself could have simply overlooked the case @xmath19 rather than implying a different ( namely , trivial ) construction in that case .",
    "in general , euclid s proofs certainly depend on a lot of missing axioms and missing conditions in statements of theorems ( see , in particular , @xcite ) , besides a really serious problem in the proofs of the sas and sss triangle congruence theorems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , avigad et al .",
    "@xcite have compiled a full list of euclid s missing axioms and postulates , and were careful enough to separate axioms from postulates  in their sense , judged by the presence of the existential quantifier , but luckily this is consistent with the view of geminus .",
    "in addition , @xcite introduces two new inference rules in order to deal with euclid s apparent circularity in triangle congruence theorems .",
    "these are certainly beyond the metamathematical knowledge of the ancients ; but in remark [ triangle congruence ] we sketch a different way of avoiding the circularity .    as noted in @xcite*1.4 ,  2.3 , it is remarkable that euclid does not use disjunctions .",
    "theorem iii.4 says that _ if neither of two intersecting chords in a circle passes through its center , then it is not the case that each of the two chords bisects the other .",
    "_ presumably , he did not want to say anything like _ ... then at least one of the chords does not bisect the other_. strictly speaking , there is a disjunction in the statement of theorem 1.13 : _ if one line set up on another makes angles , it will make either two right angles or angles [ together ] equal to [ the sum of ] two right angles .",
    "_ however , the first disjunct is logically superfluous , but perhaps helpful to clarify the meaning of the second one .",
    "also , there is an `` or '' in the statement of theorem i.26 , but it is used in the sense `` respectively '' ( i.e.  this is really a conjunction of two independent theorems that are presented simultaneously ) .    to summarize , we have two recent attempts to make sense out of the first four books of the _ elements _ in modern terms :    * the constructive geometry of beeson @xcite , @xcite , which provides a reasonably adequate formalization of problems that euclid solved or could have solved  but fails to take account of the non - constructive methods routinely used by euclid in proofs of theorems . * the classical geometry of avigad et al .",
    "@xcite , which provides a reasonably adequate formalization of theorems that euclid proved or could have proved  but fails to take account of the rules that he adhered to in solutions of problems .",
    "interpretations of the _ elements _ have been extensively discussed , mostly in highly informal language , by historians and philosophers from renaissance to recent years ( see @xcite , @xcite*1.2 , @xcite*2.2 , @xcite*ch .  2 , @xcite*ch .  6 ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most notably , a. rodin has suggested in his recent book on categorical logic and constructive type theory @xcite that what euclid was doing in the elements might have been not exactly the axiomatic method in the modern sense ( of hilbert ) , but a certain entirely different kind of an axiomatic method ( whose details are yet to be understood ) capturing the spirit of constructivism and categorical foundations ; he also draws interesting parallels between this alternative axiomatic method and the univalent foundations project ( see @xcite ) . in our view , the simplest and the closest formalization of the letter and the spirit of the elements is nothing but the usual ( hilbert - style ) axiomatic method , only based not on classical logic but on qhc .",
    "such a formalization is outlined in  [ tarski - beeson ] .",
    "namely , we describe a theory over qhc whose classical side proves all theorems of euclidean geometry , as formalized by avigad et al .",
    "@xcite , and nothing else ; and whose intuitionistic side solves all problems of euclidean geometry , as formalized by beeson @xcite , and nothing else .",
    "as mentioned above , our formalization of the logical structure of the first four books of the _ elements _ , as it stands , is only made possible by the simplicity of the logical structure of the sentences involved .",
    "now that modern mathematics is accustomed to more complex logic , is it still possible to combine the classical and constructivist approaches within the framework of qhc ? as a first step towards this question , let us look at some mathematics that is inaccessible to the methods of geometric algebra as exposed in the _ elements _  since trisection of an angle corresponds to solution of a certain cubic equation .",
    "let @xmath21 be a continuous map ( for instance , this could be a real polynomial @xmath22 or a complex polynomial @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , and consider the following parametric problem @xmath25 , @xmath26 :    _ find a solution of the equation @xmath27 .",
    "_    thus each point - inverse @xmath28 is nothing but the set of solutions of @xmath25 .",
    "the proposition @xmath29 , which reads :    _ the equation @xmath27 has a solution , _    is either true or false for each particular value of @xmath30 .",
    "the _ truth value _ of @xmath31 as a parametric proposition ( in other words , a predicate ) , is the set of all @xmath26 for which @xmath29 is true .",
    "this set is of course the image @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath33 is another continuous map , the problem of finding a solution of the system of equations @xmath34 is the same as the problem of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the obvious map to @xmath37 from the fiberwise product @xmath38 .",
    "thus the conjunction of propositions @xmath39 has as its truth value the image @xmath40 .",
    "this image is , of course , the intersection @xmath41 .    similarly , the problem of finding a solution of the union of equations @xmath42 is the same as the problem @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the obvious map to @xmath37 from the disjoint union @xmath45 .",
    "thus the disjunction of propositions @xmath46 has as its truth value the image @xmath47 .",
    "this image is , of course , the union @xmath48 .",
    "the reader might already start suspecting that some kind of categorification must be going on .",
    "conjunction and disjunction of parametric propositions correspond , unsurprisingly , to intersection and union of their truth values ; whereas conjunction and disjunction of problems ( which is , in fact , notationally represented by the traditional signs @xmath49 and @xmath50 as long as we understand the line containing an equation as implicitly asking to find a solution of this equation ) correspond to product and coproduct of their sets of solutions ( in the category of spaces over @xmath37 ) .",
    "now let us consider the parametric problem @xmath51 of reducing the parametric equation @xmath27 to the parametric equation @xmath52 .",
    "what is a solution of this problem , and when does one exist ?",
    "one thing is clear : if there is a reduction of @xmath27 to @xmath52 , then whenever the latter has a solution , the former must also have one .",
    "this amounts to the following implication between propositions : @xmath53 .",
    "this implication in turn corresponds to the inclusion of the truth value of @xmath54 in the set @xmath55 of those @xmath30 for which @xmath56 implies @xmath57 .",
    "note , however , that if @xmath58 are complex polynomials of nonzero degree , then by the fundamental theorem of algebra @xmath59 , so the said implication is a vacuous condition on @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    on the other hand , we all know how to solve the quadratic equation @xmath62 . upon rewriting it in the form @xmath63 we see that it _ reduces _ to the simpler equation @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , which can be solved directly : @xmath66 .",
    "the actual _ reduction _ of the former equation to the latter one is given by the substitution @xmath67 , whose result @xmath68 `` miraculously '' simplifies . in general , an equation @xmath27 , where @xmath21 is continuous , reduces trivially to any equation of the form @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is continuous : by finding a solution @xmath71 of the latter equation , we immediately obtain the solution @xmath72 of the former one . to find a substantial reduction , one seeks to rewrite the given equation @xmath27 in the form @xmath73 so that the equation @xmath74 can be solved for @xmath9 ; this solution yields the desired function @xmath75 .",
    "a simple illustration of the power of this method is vieta s solution of the cubic equation @xmath76 .",
    "firstly , the substitution @xmath77 reduces it to the form @xmath78 .",
    "secondly , the substitution @xmath79 results in the equation @xmath80 , in which @xmath81 runs over @xmath82 .",
    "thirdly , the substitution @xmath83{w}$ ] yields a reduction to the equation @xmath84 , which upon multiplication by @xmath85 becomes quadratic ( and so can be solved as above ) .    in the last substitution , @xmath83{w}$ ] , the reducing `` function ''",
    "@xmath75 is necessarily multivalued if we work over @xmath86 ; in other cases of interest , it may well fail to be total .",
    "for instance , in reducing the real biquadratic equation @xmath87 to the quadratic equation @xmath88 one has to deal with the multivalued partially defined function @xmath89 . if @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the quadratic equation has two solutions , and the biquadratic no solutions , so we do not really have _ any _ reduction of the latter to the former .",
    "if @xmath92 and @xmath91 , the quadratic equation has two solutions and the biquadratic four solutions , so we actually have two _ distinct _ reductions of the latter to the former . the number of reductions may well change depending on the value of our parameter @xmath30 alone : for @xmath93 there is only one ( vacuous ) reduction , and for @xmath94 there is no reduction , since one of the two roots of the quadratic equation has no ( real ) square root and so does not yield any solution of the biquadratic equation .",
    "thus reduction is , generally speaking , a local notion , depending on the value of the parameter @xmath30 . arguably ,",
    "then , a reduction of @xmath27 to @xmath52 should be given by a continuous map @xmath95 defined on the preimage @xmath96 of some open neighborhood @xmath97 of @xmath30 such that the composition @xmath98 equals the restriction of @xmath61 . in other words , reductions of @xmath27 to @xmath52 are the germs at @xmath30 of such maps @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath99 denotes the set of such germs @xmath100 , there is a natural topology on @xmath101 , where a neighborhood of @xmath100 is given by the germs @xmath102 for all @xmath103 .",
    "the map @xmath104 , @xmath105 , is known as the _ sheaf of germs of maps @xmath106 over @xmath37 _ , and we conclude that the parametric problem @xmath51 can be identified with @xmath107 .",
    "now there seems to be a little issue with this definition .",
    "there is the trivial equation @xmath108 , corresponding to the case @xmath109 , @xmath110 . if the problem @xmath111 of finding a solution of this trivial equation is really a trivial problem , then any problem @xmath112 should be equivalent to the problem @xmath113 of reducing the equation @xmath27 to the trivial equation @xmath108 . but @xmath114 is also known as the _ sheaf of germs of sections _ of the map @xmath60 , and @xmath115 is inequivalent to @xmath112 already for polynomial @xmath60 , either complex ( due to multiple roots ) or real ( due to roots of even multiplicity ) ; see @xcite*example [ int : equations ] for the details .",
    "our approach to this issue is that it is not the definition of reduction between parametric problems that is not quite right , but the very formulation of our problem @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , if we replace it by the problem @xmath116 , the issue disappears . in closed terms , the problem @xmath117 asks to find only _ stable solutions _ of the equation @xmath27 , that is , such @xmath118 that @xmath119 and there exists a neighborhood @xmath97 of @xmath30 in @xmath37 over which @xmath60 has a section ( that is , a map @xmath120 such that the composition @xmath121 equals the inclusion map @xmath122 ) .",
    "what has been said above about parametric problems of the form @xmath112 carries over to those of the form @xmath123 ; the result is nothing but a special case of the sheaf model of  [ models ] .",

    "( as long as our language has only finitely many types of atomic propositions ) at some point we will have to refer , directly or indirectly , to an atomic proposition of the same type as the one being expressed . while it is not obvious that _ any _ such circularity would necessarily boil down to `` cutting the gordian knot '' in the sense of  [ euclidean ] , even if one does not , it would be quite hard to prove this . in this sense",
    ", the approach of `` circular certification '' looks somewhat dangerous .",
    "thus it seems worthwhile to explore also the remaining option : introducing atomic problems . here",
    "again one can simply declare , for each atomic proposition @xmath220 ( or at least for some @xmath220 chosen so as to avoid the circularity ) , an ad hoc atomic problem @xmath474 along with the axiom @xmath475 .",
    "( of course , one can also do this for negated atomic propositions , and @xmath476 would apparently not reduce to @xmath474 , since @xmath477 . ) in specific areas to be formalized , one can ask , of course , if these artificially introduced atomic problems can be given any natural meaning , so as to motivate the new axioms .",
    "for instance , in our planar geometry ( see  [ tarski - beeson ] ) we have @xmath422 if and only if one can find an isometry of the plane that sends @xmath478 to @xmath479 and @xmath30 to @xmath480 .    for",
    "another specific example , let us consider the equality relation in a group , in case we would want to do a formal theory of an abstract group over qhc .",
    "( in fact , as long as we have the multiplication , the unit and the inverse as predefined functions in the language , it is natural to leave all usual group axioms on the side of classical logic .",
    "yet one can still formulate substantial problems in this theory , such as @xmath481 or @xmath482 $ ] . )",
    "thus we are looking for a problem @xmath483 such that @xmath405 is equivalent to @xmath484 .",
    "( strictly speaking , we also have atomic propositions like @xmath485 , but then we will also have problems like @xmath486 . )",
    "if we want this @xmath483 to have some meaning , we are bound to strip our abstract group of some of its abstractness .",
    "there are at least two natural options : a represented group and a presented group .",
    "if our group is identified , for example , with a group of permutations of some set @xmath257 , then variables of the language run over permutations , and we may take @xmath487 to be the problem , _ check that @xmath488 for all @xmath489_. this effectively reduces the equality of permutations to the equality of elements of @xmath257 ( which itself is not to be explained ) .",
    "on the other hand , suppose that our group is given by a presentation @xmath490 ( where the @xmath491 are words in the alphabet @xmath492 ) , or equivalently by the 2-dimensional cw - complex @xmath493 with one @xmath494-cell whose @xmath495-cells correspond to the @xmath496 and whose @xmath497-cells are glued to the union @xmath498 of the @xmath495-cells along the loops corresponding to the @xmath491 .",
    "then the variables of the language run over words in @xmath253 , and we may take @xmath499 to be the problem , _ rewrite @xmath500 into @xmath85 modulo the relations @xmath491 _ ( which means , find a based homotopy in @xmath493 between the loops in @xmath498 corresponding to the words @xmath500 and @xmath85 ) .",
    "note that this instance of destruction of abstraction goes in the direction of categorification .    by the same token , in order to understand arithmetic in terms of theorems and problems in a substantial way , it seems best to avoid variants of the peano axioms or variants of the von neumann construction , and instead follow the frege / russell  whitehead approach , in which natural numbers are equivalence classes of finite sets .",
    "( structures based on this approach include the categorified natural numbers @xcite and the universe of finite h - sets in homotopy type theory . )",
    "then again the equality predicate becomes certifiable , for if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are finite sets , then @xmath405 if and only if one can find a bijection between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "now that addition and multiplication of natural numbers are represented by the coproduct and product in the category of finite sets , we find ourselves in an obscure first - order corner of category theory , topos theory and type theory , where variants of mathematical induction can manifest themselves in an unexpected way @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a further investigation of the situation with induction seems to be needed ( which is in fact an active area of research ) before one can sensibly try to formalize arithmetic over qhc .",
    "it is also clear that eventually the intuitionistic side of qhc should transform into a constructive type theory , but it is presently not clear to the author if this transformation should occur before , after , or simultaneously with the desired formalization of arithmetic .",
    "the _ commentary _ on the first book of the _ elements _ by the philosopher proclus @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is largely  and perhaps entirely  a compilation of earlier sources , most of which are now lost ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite*p .",

    "41 , ( 5 ) ( which is apparently supported by the findings of tannery , van pesch and tittel that he mentions @xcite*p .",
    "39 ) , the following extract from proclus _ commentary _ ( with the exception of the passage starting with `` both parties are right '' ) `` may fairly be attributed to geminus '' , whose lost treatise proclus explicitly quotes a number of times in his _",
    "commentary_.          in another part of proclus _ commentary _ we find another discussion of the logical structure of the _ elements _ , which heath again thinks is likely borrowed from geminus @xcite*p .",
    "40 , ( 9 ) . here",
    "proclus gives a definition of problems and theorems ( this is the paragraph quoted in the beginning of  [ intro ] ) , which is followed by this passage :      pappus opened the third book of his _ collection _ , addressed to a teacher of mathematics named pandrosion , with the following words , which in particular suggest the perceived etymology of the words _ problem _ and _ theorem _ @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) :    in modern language , pappus seems to be saying that in contrast to a theorem , which comes along with the judgement asserting its validity , a problem as such has no truth value , and so entails no judgement ; but an alleged solution to a problem again comes with the judgement asserting its validity .",
    "this should be compared with kolmogorov s conclusion in his discussion of the object of intuitionistic logic @xcite*2 : `` thus what brouwer understands by an existential proposition is completely broken down into two elements : the objective element ( the problem ) and the subjective element ( the solution ) . ''",
    "pappus words also remind us that the distinction between a proposition and a theorem ( i.e. , a proposition that is considered to have a proof ) corresponds to two meanings of the word `` problem '' ( either english or ancient greek ) : a proposed problem , and a problem that is considered to have a solution .    the introduction to the seventh book of pappus _ collection _ @xcite also distinguishes between `` two kinds of analysis : one of them seeks after truth , and is called ` theorematic ' ; while the other tries to find what was demanded , and is called ` problematic ' . ''",
    "it should be noted that both proclus and pappus discuss porisms , which are considered to be intermediate between problems and theorems . these are not used in euclid s _ elements _ ( whose more advanced volumes contain ` porisms ' in another sense of the word , which also means ` corollary ' ) .",
    "the present author has doubts that the alleged difference between porisms and problems has anything to do with mathematics .",
    "we do not know , indeed , which of the three approaches are closer to what euclid had in his mind .",
    "we know , however , that aristotle s view has been very influential , and is best compatible with the foundational paradigm that dominates since the early 20th century ; but also that the view of geminus has enjoyed steady support until the end of 19th century ( see  [ intro ] ) .      proclus also mentions some logical properties of problems , which somewhat agree with kolmogorov s understanding of problems and solutions and include the possibility of distinct solutions for a problem .",
    "the problem of two mean proportionals is : _ given lengths @xmath478 and @xmath30 , find lengths @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath501 .",
    "_ assuming that such @xmath9 and @xmath10 are known when @xmath502 , one immediately gets from this the doubling of the cube , since @xmath503",

    "algebraically , this amounts to the equation @xmath506 .",
    "proclus goes on to produce infinitely many solutions by euclid s geometric methods .",
