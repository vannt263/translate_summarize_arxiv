    "two states , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , have been discovered recently both in continuum @xmath1 annihilation near @xmath9 gev/@xmath10 and in @xmath11 meson decays  @xcite .",
    "their spin - parities are , respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite , and they are presumed to be p - wave excited @xmath14 states with @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is the orbital angular momentum and @xmath17 is the spin of the light antiquark . however , their masses are unexpectedly low  @xcite .",
    "this has renewed interest in measurements of p - wave excited charm mesons .",
    "we report the first observation of the decay @xmath18 .",
    "( the inclusion of charge - conjugate modes is implied throughout this paper . )",
    "the @xmath19 pair in the final state is the only @xmath20 combination that can not come from a @xmath21 resonance : @xmath22 mesons can only be produced virtually here since @xmath23 .",
    "the new @xmath24 mode reported here is only the second observed three - body decay of the @xmath25 , after @xmath26  @xcite .    in addition , we have performed an angular analysis of the @xmath27 mode .",
    "heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) predicts that for an infinitely heavy @xmath28-quark this decay of a @xmath29 , @xmath30 state should proceed via a pure d - wave  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding decay of its partner , the @xmath8 , which is believed to be a @xmath13 , @xmath31 state is energetically forbidden , but if it were allowed it would proceed via a pure s - wave . since heavy quark symmetry is not exact , the two @xmath13 states can mix with each other , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the states with @xmath31 and @xmath30 , respectively . note that the coupling via common decay channels can give a contribution to the mixing that might not be well represented by an orthogonal rotation  @xcite .",
    "we neglect this possibility in the expression above .",
    "if @xmath35 , an s - wave component can appear in the decay @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , even if @xmath37 is small , the s - wave component can give a sizeable contribution to the width because the d - wave contribution is strongly suppressed by the small energy release in the @xmath36 decay .",
    "the first attempt to decompose s- and d - waves in the analogous decays of the non - strange mesons @xmath38 and @xmath39 was reported more than ten years ago by cleo  @xcite ; currently , no results on the @xmath25 exist .",
    "moreover , cleo s method did not allow the measurement of the ratio of partial widths : it only determined the relation between this ratio and the relative phase between the s- and d - wave amplitudes .",
    "some information on @xmath37 is obtained from the ratio of electromagnetic decay rates @xmath40 , since only the @xmath41 state in @xmath8 undergoes an e1 transition to @xmath42 and only the @xmath43 state to @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "the bases @xmath45 and @xmath46 are related by the rotation angle @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "the angle between the bases @xmath49 and @xmath46 is @xmath50 .",
    "the belle collaboration studied @xmath40 decays using @xmath8 from both @xmath11 decays  @xcite and from @xmath1 annihilation  @xcite , and determined the ratio of decay rates to be @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the average ratio of @xmath53 gives the constraint @xmath54 .",
    "detailed knowledge of the mixing is important to test different theoretical models  @xcite , to fix their parameters and to understand better the nature of @xmath55 mesons .",
    "finally , using the @xmath56 mode , we have measured the spin alignment of high momentum @xmath25 mesons produced in @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "production of excited mesons in the hqet framework is described in ref .",
    "the fragmentation process is assumed to be so rapid that the color magnetic forces do not have time to act and thus the spin of the light antiquark in the produced meson is uncorrelated with that of the heavy quark .",
    "one consequence of this is that @xmath21 mesons with @xmath57 are produced unpolarized .",
    "this was confirmed with good accuracy by cleo  @xcite in @xmath58 events at @xmath59  gev and was also checked by other experiments  @xcite .",
    "another prediction is that @xmath21 and @xmath60 mesons are produced according to the number of available helicity states in a 3:1 ratio .",
    "however , experimental data from several different production mechanisms ( @xmath1 , hadroproduction , photoproduction , etc . ) give an average probability for an s - wave meson to be produced in a vector state of @xmath61  @xcite , which is much smaller than the expected value of 0.75 .",
    "there are no similar measurements for the p - wave states .",
    "contrary to the @xmath62 case , hqet predicts that the members of @xmath30 doublet can be produced aligned .",
    "the probabilities for the light degree of freedom to have helicity @xmath63 are expressed via one parameter @xmath64 as @xmath65 , respectively . by adding the @xmath28-quark spin and resolving the @xmath14 system into @xmath13 and @xmath66 states",
    ", one can calculate their alignment .",
    "for @xmath25 the probability of zero helicity is @xmath67 .",
    "a calculation based on perturbative qcd and a nonrelativistic quark model gives @xmath68  @xcite and @xmath69 .",
    "this calculation also predicts the dependence of @xmath64 on the longitudinal momentum fraction and on the transverse momentum of the meson relative to the heavy quark jet .",
    "the argus analysis of the angular distributions in @xmath70 decay  @xcite gives an upper limit @xmath71 at 90%  cl  @xcite .",
    "once @xmath64 is measured , one can make definite predictions for the angular distributions of the remaining @xmath30 meson decays and check the validity of hqet .",
    "this study is based on a data sample of 462  fb@xmath0 collected near the @xmath72 resonance with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath1 ( 3.5 on 8  gev ) collider  @xcite .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector , a 50-layer central drift chamber , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath73 mesons and to identify muons .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two inner detector configurations were used . a 2.0 cm beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector",
    "were used for the first sample of 155  fb@xmath0 , while a 1.5 cm beampipe , a 4-layer silicon detector and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 307  fb@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 candidates are required to originate from the vicinity of the event - dependent interaction point . to identify kaons , we combine the ionization energy loss ( @xmath76 ) from the central drift chamber , time of flight and cherenkov light yield information for each track to form kaon and pion likelihoods @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively ,  @xcite and then impose the requirement @xmath79 .",
    "this requirement has 98% ( 97% ) efficiency for a kaon from @xmath25 ( kaon from @xmath60 ) and a 12% ( 17% ) misidentification probability for a pion with the same momentum .",
    "all unused tracks , whether identified as a kaon or not , are treated as pion candidates in what follows .",

    "are reconstructed using @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 decay modes , respectively .",
    "all combinations with masses within @xmath90  mev/@xmath10 of the nominal @xmath60 mass are selected ( 99% efficiency ) ; a mass and vertex constrained fit is then applied .",
    "@xmath91 mesons are reconstructed using the @xmath92 mode .",
    "the slow @xmath93 momentum resolution is degraded by multiple scattering , but is improved by a track refit procedure in which the @xmath93 origin point is constrained by the intersection of the @xmath83 momentum and the known @xmath1 interaction region .",
    "the @xmath92 mass is required to be within @xmath94  mev/@xmath10 of the @xmath91 nominal value , which corresponds to 98% efficiency .",
    "a @xmath91 mass constraint is not imposed .",
    "instead , we characterize the @xmath95 candidate using the mass difference @xmath96 , where the error in the @xmath91 momentum nearly cancels out . for the @xmath97 decay mode ,",
    "the track refit procedure described above is applied to the pion and kaon momenta , and the @xmath95 is characterized by the @xmath98 mass .",
    "it is known that the momentum spectrum of the excited charm resonances from continuum @xmath1 annihilation is hard .",
    "in addition , due to the strong magnetic field in the belle detector , the reconstruction efficiency for slow @xmath75 and @xmath99 mesons rises with @xmath25 momentum .",
    "therefore , we require @xmath100 for the scaled momentum @xmath101 , defined as the ratio @xmath102 . here , @xmath103 is the momentum of the @xmath25 candidate in the @xmath1 center - of - mass frame , while @xmath104 is the momentum in this frame for a candidate carrying all the beam energy .",
    "this selection also removes @xmath25 mesons produced in the decays of @xmath11 mesons .    in monte carlo ( mc ) simulation ,",

    "the @xmath25 momentum spectrum as measured with the @xmath56 decay mode is used for mc generation .",
    "as shown below , no clear resonant substructure is visible in the decay @xmath18 .",

    "( [ pdf ] ) is almost constant in all three projections . when it is set to a constant value in the fit , the results change by less than 1/3 of the statistical error .",
    "the background fraction @xmath246 is small",
    ". therefore one does not expect any significant biases of the fit results .    to quantify this statement , 1000 samples of events",
    "are generated according to pdf eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) .",
    "each sample contains the same number of events as observed in data .",
    "the parameters @xmath234 and @xmath171 are set to the values determined from data .",
    "a three - dimensional fit is performed for each sample ; it is verified that the fit results are not systematically biased and the errors are estimated correctly .",
    "the value of the overall likelihood function is measured to be worse than the one observed in data in 33% of cases . as a final check",
    ", the fit to data is repeated in different bins of the mass recoiling against the @xmath25 , defined as @xmath247 , where all quantities are measured in the @xmath1 center - of - mass frame .",
    "the parameters @xmath177 and @xmath178 are found to be independent of @xmath25 momentum or recoil mass within statistical errors .",
    "the recoil mass spectrum is shown in the top half of fig .",
    "the resolution is about 70  mev/@xmath10 at 2  gev/@xmath10 and is approximately inversely proportional to the recoil mass .",
    "there is an indication of two - body contributions from @xmath248 where @xmath249 , @xmath44 and higher @xmath250 resonances .",
    "this agrees with the @xmath25 polarization spectrum , shown in the bottom half of fig .",
    "[ rm ] , which also exhibits some structure at low recoil masses .",
    "this spectrum is obtained when @xmath177 and @xmath178 are fixed to their values determined from the overall fit . at @xmath42 mass , as one expects , the longitudinal polarization is low .",

    "it can be produced only through the virtual @xmath22 , broad @xmath253 or @xmath254 resonances .",
    "in addition , the @xmath108 final state can be formed by two - body decays to a @xmath84 and a virtual @xmath255 or higher @xmath256 resonance .",
    "no clear resonant substructure is found in the @xmath108 system .",
    "the ratio of branching fractions @xmath257 is measured to be @xmath4 .",
    "an angular analysis of the decay @xmath163 is also performed .",
    "since the @xmath28-quark is not infinitely heavy , hqet is violated and the @xmath25 can contain an admixture of another @xmath29 state with @xmath31 and can decay in an s - wave .",
    "the energy release in this reaction is small .",
    "therefore the d - wave is suppressed by the barrier factor @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the relative momentum of @xmath25 decay products in the @xmath25 rest frame , and @xmath260 is a momentum scale characteristic of the decay .",
    "the s - wave contribution to the total width is proportional to @xmath261 and can be sizeable even if the mixing is small . using an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the three angles in the @xmath56 , @xmath173 decay chain , we measure ( up to a complex conjugation ) the ratio of s- and d - wave amplitudes : @xmath262 .",
    "the s - wave dominates , and its contribution to the total width is @xmath6 .",
    "this result allows to calculate the mixing angle in the theoretical models with a known value of parameter @xmath260  @xcite .",
