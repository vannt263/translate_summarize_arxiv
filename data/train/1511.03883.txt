    "a _ positive braid knot _ is a knot that can be obtained from a positive braid via the closure operation , an important example being torus knots .",
    "a _ positive braid on @xmath26 strands _ is a finite word in positive powers of the braid generators @xmath27 . by a theorem of stallings ,",
    "positive braid knots are fibred with the standard seifert surface as fibre  @xcite .",
    "as baader did in  @xcite , we use _ brick diagrams _ to visualise the fibre surface of positive braid knots : each horizontal bar corresponds to a braid generator @xmath28 and each _ brick _ , i.e. each rectangle , corresponds to a positive hopf band in the plumbing construction of the fibre surface .",
    "if two bricks link , it means that the core curves of the corresponding positive hopf bands intersect once , see figure  [ linking ] .",
    "let the _ linking pattern _ be the the plane graph obtained by putting a vertex into every brick and an edge between two vertices exactly if the corresponding bricks link .",
    "it can be easily seen that if the intersection pattern of a positive braid @xmath29 is not connected , then the positive braid link @xmath30 is not prime .",
    "in fact , the converse is also true since positive braids are visually prime by a theorem of cromwell  @xcite .",
    "let us for a moment consider the case where the linking pattern is a tree .",
    "there are many brick diagrams that yield the same tree as linking pattern .",
    "since closures of positive braids corresponding to different brick diagrams might be equivalent as links in @xmath31 , it is natural to ask whether the plane tree of the linking pattern uniquely determines the positive braid link up to ambient isotopy .",
    "as we will see in the following remark , this is indeed the case .",
    "[ monodromiedeterminiert ] _ the fibre surface @xmath32 of a positive braid @xmath29 retracts to its brick diagram .",
    "since for a successive plumbing of positive hopf bands , the monodromy is conjugate to the product ( in the succession of plumbing ) of positive dehn twists along the core curves of the hopf bands  @xcite , the conjugacy class of the monodromy ( and therefore also the corresponding fibred link @xmath30 ) is completely determined by the plane tree given by the linking pattern of the brick diagram . _    furthermore , if the linking pattern is a tree , a matrix for the seifert form of the corresponding fibre surface @xmath33 is particularly easy to describe : as a basis of @xmath34 take the core curves @xmath35 $ ] of the positive hopf bands corresponding to the bricks .",
    "a matrix @xmath36 for the seifert form is then given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 if @xmath39 and the curves @xmath40 and @xmath41 intersect ( i.e.  if the corresponding vertices of the linking pattern are connected by an edge ) .",
    "all other entries are equal to zero .    in order to detect genus defect for a positive braid knot @xmath30 , we search for minors @xmath42 or @xmath43 in the fibre surface",
    "this is always based on the fact that the linking pattern of @xmath29 contains the tree corresponding to @xmath42 or @xmath43 via deleting vertices and contracting edges .",
    "one can then see that also @xmath32 contains @xmath42 or @xmath43 , respectively , as a surface minor , implying @xmath44 .",
    "for example , figure  [ h - tilde ] shows how the tree corresponding to @xmath20 is contained in the linking pattern of the positive braid @xmath45 .",
    "before we prove it for the case of positive braid knots , we show an analogue of theorem  [ equivalenz ] for knots obtained as _ plumbing of positive hopf bands along a tree @xmath46_. this notion generalises knots corresponding to brick diagrams having some plane tree as linking pattern . starting from any finite plane tree @xmath46 , we plumb positive hopf bands ( which are in one - to - one correspondence with the vertices of the tree ) such that their core curves intersect once exactly if the corresponding vertices of @xmath46 are connected by an edge .",
    "otherwise , they do not intersect .",
    "furthermore , they respect the circular ordering of the vertices given by the plane tree structure of @xmath46 . by the argument given in remark  [ monodromiedeterminiert ] ,",
    "there is , up to ambient isotopy , only one way to do this .",
    "this construction is strictly more general than positive braid knots with a plane tree as linking pattern : vertices of a tree can have arbitrary valency , while for linking patterns associated with positive braid knots , this valency is bounded from above by @xmath47 .",
    "[ trees_prop ] for a knot @xmath1 obtained by plumbing positive hopf bands along a plane tree @xmath46 , the equality @xmath8 holds exactly if @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 , then @xmath8 follows from the signature bound of kauffman and taylor  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath48 , we distinguish three different cases . if @xmath46 has at least three vertices of degree at least three , then the corresponding fibre surface contains @xmath49 as a minor and thus @xmath23 . if @xmath46 has two vertices of degree at least three , then at least one branch emanating from such a vertex is of length at least two , since otherwise @xmath1 can not be a knot .",
    "again the corresponding fibre surface contains @xmath49 as a minor .",
    "if @xmath46 has only one vertex of degree at least three , then @xmath48 holds if and only if @xmath46 contains the linking pattern of @xmath50 or @xmath17 as an induced subgraph .",
    "again , for @xmath1 to be a knot , at least one of the branches of the linking pattern of @xmath50 or @xmath17 has to be extended and @xmath46 in fact contains the linking pattern of @xmath42 or @xmath43 as an induced subgraph .",
    "hence , the corresponding fibre surface contains @xmath42 or @xmath43 as a surface minor .",
    "the proof of theorem  1 for positive braid knots @xmath1 is divided into two parts , depending on the _ positive braid index _ of @xmath1 , i.e.  the minimal index of a positive braid @xmath29 representing the knot @xmath1 . for @xmath1 of positive index at most three , we can essentially reduce the problem to proposition  [ trees_prop ] . for @xmath1 of positive index at least four ,",
