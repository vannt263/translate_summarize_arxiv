    "thus , as long as the period of inflation is sufficiently long , all scales of cosmological interest today originate inside the hubble radius during inflation .",
    "recently , it has been realized that if inflation lasts slightly longer than the minimal time ( i. e. the time it needs to last in order to solve the horizon problem and to provide a causal generation mechanism for cmb fluctuations ) , then the corresponding physical wavelength of these fluctuations at the beginning of inflation will be smaller than the planck length .",

    "however in the trans - planckian inflationary scenario , to our knowledge , such a calculation has never been performed and the scalar / tensor power spectrum , with the trans - planckian corrections , were obtained from the presumed perturbation equations .    with the possibility of detecting the trans - planckian signatures in the current and future cmb experiments , it becomes _ imperative _ to obtain the scalar and tensor perturbation equation from the first principles .",
