    "an important hallmark of slow relaxation is the lack of time - translation - invariance , manifested through aging behavior .",
    "a similar phenomenology is also observed in systems without disorder , e.g. , ferromagnets quenched below the critical point .",
    "the behavior of these systems is well understood in terms of the domain growth mechanism of slow relaxation @xcite .",
    "the key feature of domain growth , or coarsening , is the unbounded growth of the domain size , which entails scaling due to the existence of a dominant length scale , and aging as a manifestation of scaling in multiple - time observables .",
    "the simplicity of this structure is very attractive and is expected to be valid beyond the realm of disorder - free phase - separating systems , establishing domain growth as a paradigm of slow relaxation .",
    "however , as is well known , the applicability of domain growth concepts to _ hard _ problems ( such as spin glasses or structural glasses ) still remains a debated issue @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of considerable interest to study the role of disorder in systems where its presence does not compete with phase ordering  @xcite .",
    "a class of systems of this type are disordered ferromagnets , where disorder coexists with the low - temperature ferromagnetic order .",
    "there are different ways to introduce disorder in a ferromagnet without inducing frustration .",
    "this can be achieved through bond or site dilution , by randomizing the exchange interaction strength while keeping it ferromagnetic , or by introducing a random external field .",
    "these disordered systems have been an active area of research for quite some time now .",
    "the unifying theme of investigation has been disorder - induced changes in the properties of the underlying pure systems , with primary interest in the _ growth law _",
    ", in the _ equal - time correlation function _ and , more recently , in the _ two - time autocorrelation function _ and the related _ response function _ @xcite . however , despite the many experimental and theoretical studies @xcite , a number of issues are still open . among these , of primary importance are ( i ) the nature of the asymptotic growth law ( _ power - law _ vs. _ logarithmic _ ) and ( ii ) the existence of _ superuniversal _ behavior of the correlation and response functions .",
    "this is the idea that scaling functions are robust with respect to disorder , which is expected not to change the low temperature properties of the system @xcite .",
    "the lack of a general framework to understand this complex phenomenology has proven a major obstacle to development . recently , in the context of the random bond ising model ( rbim )  @xcite , we have shown that the renormalization group ( rg ) picture of crossover phenomena may well serve the purpose .    in this paper , we extend the rg conceptual framework to the ordering dynamics of the random field ising model ( rfim ) @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the deep asymptotic regime turns out to be numerically accessible , allowing us to make precise statements regarding the growth law and the superuniversality ( su ) issue ( see subsection  [ su ] ) .",
    "our principal findings are ( a ) the existence of a crossover from power law domain growth ( with a _ disorder - dependent _ exponent ) to logarithmic growth , and ( b ) the absence of su .",

    "then , all other lengths can be rescaled with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , the two - time order - parameter correlation function @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , scales as  @xcite c(r , t , t_w ) = g(r / l , l / l_w ) [ scl.1 ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for @xmath8 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "this contains , as a special case , the usual scaling of the equal - time ( @xmath14 ) correlation function @xmath15 .",
    "further , for @xmath16 , we have the aging form of the autocorrelation function @xmath17 .",
    "the validity of scaling is , by now , a well - established fact .",
    "a complete picture of an ordering problem requires the understanding of the growth law ( i.e. how @xmath8 depends on @xmath18 ) and of the scaling function @xmath19 .",
    "a systematic study of the growth law has been undertaken by lai et al .",
    "( lmv )  @xcite , who identified four different universality classes of growth kinetics .",
    "lmv considered the role of several factors in the ordering dynamics , e.g. , temperature , conservation laws , dimensionality , order parameter symmetry , lattice structure and disorder .",
    "an important distinction is made between systems that do not freeze ( i.e. , without free - energy barriers ) and those that do freeze ( i.e. , with barriers ) when the quench is made to @xmath6 . to the first category belong pure systems with non - conserved dynamics , whose growth follows the power law @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",

    "furthermore , the prefactor @xmath24 has a strong temperature dependence , @xmath25 .",
    "finally , in _ class 3 _ and _ class 4 _ systems , the freezing involves a collective behavior which depends on the domain size @xmath11 . if the corresponding activation energy scales with @xmath11 like @xmath26 , where @xmath27 measures the disorder strength , the asymptotic growth law is logarithmic l(t ) ~(t/)^1/ ^1/ [ class ] with @xmath28 . for _ class 3 _ systems , we have @xmath29 , and for _ class 4 _ systems , we have @xmath30 .    ferromagnets ( with or without disorder ) offer examples of the classes listed above . for simplicity ,",

    "recently , we have presented evidence  @xcite for logarithmic growth in the @xmath5 rbim , but have not established whether it is a class 3 or class 4 system .",
    "this is a particularly interesting system , because its growth law was previously  @xcite believed to be power law with a disorder - dependent exponent .",
    "if so , this would have shown the existence of a new universality class , say _ class 5 _ , in addition to the four listed by lmv .",
    "we should stress that a huge numerical effort is involved in accessing the logarithmic growth regime of the @xmath5 rbim , and our understanding of this system remains incomplete .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have proposed to unify this wide variety of behaviors for disordered domain growth into a scaling framework for the growth law itself . in all the cases we consider in this paper , disorder ( @xmath33 ) and temperature ( @xmath34 ) enter through their ratio @xmath35 ( see sec .",

    "the scaling function shows a crossover corresponding to the crossover in the growth law .    in the light of the above results , what is the path ahead ?",
    "we are currently investigating other disordered systems to confirm whether the domain growth scenario is consistent with the scaling picture developed here .",
