    "weak gravitational lensing has been widely recognized as a unique and very powerful method for studying not only the mass distribution of the universe but also cosmological parameters ( mellier 1999 , schneider 2006 , munshi et al .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of this field is to accurately measure the cosmic shear which is coherent distortion of background galaxies induced by large scale structure of the universe , because this effect depends on the evolution of the structure which is influenced by the nature of dark energy .",
    "there have been some detections of cosmic shear ( bacon et al 2000 ; maoli et al 2001 ; refregier et al 2002 ; bacon et al 2003 ; hamana et al 2003 , casertano et al 2003 ; van waerbeke et al 2005 ; massey et al 2005 ; hoekstra et al 2006 ) . however , since the distortion is very weak and there are many sources of noise , a very accurate measurement scheme is needed for the shapes of the huge number of background galaxies as well as a sophisticated analysis scheme for the measured shear which avoids systematic errors as much as possible . at the moment there are several plans for wide field surveys with a large enough number of galaxies to reduce the statistical error .",
    "this means the systematic errors in shear analysis methods become larger than the statistical errors .",
    "in fact , even current survey plans require systematic errors less than 1% error ( hyper suprime - cam http://www.naoj.org/projects/hsc/hscproject.html , dark energy survey http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/ , euclid http://sci.esa.int/euclid etc . ) , and 0.1% error for future planned surveys ( lsst http://www.lsst.org ) .",
    "there is another important point in the analysis for such wide survey data .",
    "for example , in the plan for the hsc wide survey , a few hundreds of millions of galaxies will be measured , therefore slow methods are not realistic even if the methods have a high accuracy .",
    "thus it is essential to develop a fast shear analysis scheme which is free from systematic errors .",
    "there have been many studies in this direction ( kaiser et al 1995 , bernstein & jarvis 2002 ; refregier 2003 ; kuijken et al .",
    "2006 ; miller et al .",
    "2007 ; kitching et al . 2008 ; melchior 2011 ) , which have been tested using simulated data ( heymans et al 2006 , massey et al 2007 , bridle et al 2010 and kitching et al 2012 ) .",
    "we also have developed new analysis methods , including the e - holics method ( e - holics part1 okura and futamase 2011 ; part2 okura and futamase 2012 ; part3 okura and futamase 2013 ) .",
    "the e - holics method avoids systematic error caused by the approximation in the weight function by adopting an appropriate elliptical weight function for shape measurement .",
    "however , the e - holics method uses an approximation for psf correction similar to other approaches .",
    "therefore , previous approaches including e - holics , can not correct the psf effect in some conditions ( e.g. large psf or high elliptical psf ) .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on psf correction and propose a new method which is free from the approximations used in previous moments methods and thus free from systematic error associated with psf correction .",
    "the idea is to produce an artificial image with the true ellipticity as the result of re - smearing the psf smeared image of the lensed image with true ellipticity .",
    "we refer to this as the ellipticity of re - smeared artificial images method ( era ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we explain our notation and definitions used in this paper . there",
    "we also describe the zero plane used in the era method .",
    "we then present psf smearing and psf correction as used in the era method in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we test this method using simple test images .",
    "finally we summarize the method and give some comments .",
    "in this section we describe the notation , definitions and basic idea used in this paper .      in this paper , we use the zero plane and zero image instead of the source plane .",
    "the idea of the zero plane is that the intrinsic ellipticity of the source comes from a ( imaginary ) circular source ( called the zero image ) in the imaginary plane ( the zero plane ) ( the details can be seen in e - holics part 2 ) .",
    "suppose we have the reduced shear of lensing and the intrinsic ellipticity respectively as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , then the relationship of the displacements between the zero plane @xmath2 , the source plane @xmath3 and the lens plane @xmath4 are described as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is combined shear which is defined as @xmath7    this combined shear has information of the intrinsic ellipticity and the lensing reduced shear . since the intrinsic ellipticities are random , the lensing reduced shear can be obtained by removing the information of intrinsic ellipticity as @xmath8    this shows that we can obtain the lensing reduced shear in two steps .",
    "the first step is to obtain the combined shear from each object ( eq.[eq : cshear ] ) and the second step is to obtain the lensing reduced shear by averaging ( eq.[eq : obtainlrs ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider only the first step , so we consider only the relationship between the zero plane and the lens plane , and we use @xmath2 as @xmath3 and @xmath6 as @xmath9 for notational simplicity .      from this point , we use the complex coordinate @xmath10 in the image plane and @xmath11 in the zero plane .",
    "reduced shear , which is defined by gravitational convergence @xmath12 and gravitational shear @xmath13 , is also complex , @xmath14 .",
    "the coordinate is associated with each image and set out the coordinate origin at the centroid of the image , which is defined by requiring that the dipole moment of the image vanishes .",
    "we use @xmath15 as complex moments of image @xmath16 measured with the weight function @xmath17 which has an arbitrary profile and an ellipticity @xmath18 which is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the higher order complex displacement from the centroid",
    ". then we simplify the notation of combinations of complex moments as @xmath21}_{(i,{{\\boldsymbol \\epsilon}})}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    although the profile of the weight function is arbitrary , it should be a realistic profile , and we use the elliptical gaussian weight function in the following simulations .",
    "if the weight function is elliptical gaussian such as @xmath22}}{\\sigma^2_w } \\right)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the gaussian scale @xmath23 should be fixed as the condition that the signal to noise ratio ( sn ) of monopole moment of the image has a maximum . in this paper",
    ", we refer to the scale of the weight function as the maximum sn scale , and define the maximum sn radius @xmath24 as @xmath25    here sn is defined as @xmath26 so the weight scale should be set as @xmath27}}{{{\\cal z}}^0_0 } \\right]}_{{\\left ( i,{{\\boldsymbol \\epsilon}}_w \\right)}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , we require that the dipole moment vanishes , so @xmath28      the ellipticity of the image @xmath16 is defined by the quadrupole moments as @xmath29}_{{\\left ( i,{{\\boldsymbol \\epsilon}}\\right)}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ellipticity of the weight function is set to the same value as the measured ellipticity .",
    "displacements in the zero plane and the image plane are related as @xmath30    the brightness distribution of the lensed image @xmath31 is made from the zero image @xmath32 by lensing , so @xmath33 .",
    "the relationship between the ellipticity of the zero image @xmath34 and the lensed image @xmath35 is obtained as @xmath36}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 .    here , because @xmath9 and @xmath35 have the same phase angle ( so @xmath38 ) , we obtain @xmath39}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the complex distortion .",
    "eq.[eq : ede2 ] can also be obtained by changing @xmath34 in eq.[eq : ede ] to @xmath41 .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath42 this result means that we obtain the complex distortion @xmath43 ( and also reduced shear ) from @xmath35 ellipticity of the lensed image @xmath44",
    "the observed image is not the lensed image but the result of various effects such as atmospheric turbulence , photon noise and pixelization of the lensed image .",
    "these various effects smear the image and change the ellipticity .",
    "the psf is supposed to express the smearing .",
    "thus we need to corrected the smearing effect to obtain the correct ellipticity . in this section",
    ", we explain the psf effect and present psf correction using the era method .      in psf correction ,",
    "the smearing effect is supposed to be described as follows : @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the brightness distribution for the observed smeared image and @xmath47 is the psf .",
    "we denote the ellipticity of @xmath46 as @xmath48 .",
    "the psf effect occurs not only for galaxies but also for stars .",
    "since a star is a point source , the brightness distribution of the smeared image of a star gives the psf at that position .",
    "therefore , the psf in the field can be obtained by some sort of interpolation from their values at the positions of stars ( we do not consider this interpolation here ) .",
    "the psf changes the ellipticity of the lensed image . for the measured moment , using a moment method such as ksb or e - holics , one can calculate the following expression .",
    "@xmath49 in the previous approach , psf correction makes use of the following approximation : @xmath50 however there is no guarantee that higher order terms are negligible and this causes systematic errors in the shear measurement ( see figures below ) .",
    "another approach of psf correction is to use deconvolution in the following way .",
    "eq.[eq : smd ] is described in fourier space as @xmath51 ( where quantities with a hat indicate fourier transformed functions ) .",
    "the lensed image is then obtained by deconvolution as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the deconvolved image .    in real analysis",
    "it sometimes happens that the denominator vanishes ( referred to as the 0 dividing problem ) , so the following modification is used .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 is referred to as the deconvolution constant .    if a large value for the deconvolution constant is used , it becomes dominant , so the deconvolved functions are far from the correct functions desired .",
    "therefore the deconvolution constant should be taken as small as possible to avoid the 0 dividing problem .    however , this approach has another problem .",
    "pixel noise makes random count in the real / fourier space , and thus we need to adopt large deconvolution constants to avoid the problem in real analysis which leads to an incorrect psf correction .",
    "therefore , the deconvolution method can not be used in real analysis .",
    "the idea of this new psf correction method is to produce an artificial image from the observed smeared image under the condition that the artificial image has the same ellipticity as the lensed image .",
    "then we can obtain the ellipticity of the lensed image and weak lensing shear by measuring the ellipticity of the artificial image .",
    "this method is referred to as era ( ellipticity of re - smeared artificial image ) . in this section ,",
    "we present the era method , and fig.[fig : era_system1 ] shows a summary of the psf correction .",
    "let s consider a circular image @xmath56 which is made from the zero image @xmath32 by smearing with an arbitrary but circular psf @xmath57 which is defined as @xmath58 and let s define @xmath59 and @xmath60 as brightness distributions made by the lensing effect from @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively , so @xmath61    because ellipticities of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are 0 , their lensed image @xmath59 and @xmath60 have ellipticity @xmath35 .",
    "this means that smearing the lensed image @xmath31 by an artificial psf @xmath60 with ellipticity @xmath35 makes artificial smeared image @xmath59 with ellipticity @xmath35 , and thus the psf effect for measuring the ellipticity is corrected by transforming the real psf @xmath47 to @xmath60 and making the artificial image @xmath59 as follows @xmath62 in this way , we obtain the psf corrected ellipticity @xmath35 by measuring the ellipticity of @xmath59 .",
    "this equation is satisfied only when the @xmath59 and @xmath63 have the same ellipticity @xmath35 , given the observed @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and thus this equation can be solved somehow .",
    "there are two possible ways to solve this equation .",
    "one is to use @xmath60 directly , which means that the psf correction is the re - smearing deconvolved image . however , because this method can not avoid the problem of 0 dividing , eq.[eq : era ] must be modified as follows @xmath66 one solves this equation starting from the initial ellipticity @xmath48 under the condition that the ellipticities of @xmath67 and @xmath60 have same values ( referred to as method a ) .",
    "another possibility is to introduce the correction for @xmath68 in the following way : @xmath69 this cancels @xmath70 in the denominator and avoids the problem of 0 dividing , so eq.[eq : era ] becomes @xmath71 this method solves eq.28 and eq.29 simultaneously to find @xmath72 under the condition that @xmath67 and @xmath73 have the same ellipticity ( referred to as method b ) .",
    "figure [ fig : era_system2 ] shows the relationship between the images .",
    "comparing these two methods , method a has a deconvolution constant , so we must be careful about the effect from it , and method b creates and measures two images so it is expected that a longer time is needed to obtain the psf corrected ellipticity compared with method a.",
    "in this section we perform several tests of the era method using simulated images and show the results . in the previous section",
    ", we introduced the artificial psf @xmath60 and the artificial image @xmath74 with the lensed ellipticity , but did not mention their profile and size . in fact , these are both very flexible . in this test",
    ", we choose a gaussian profile and use several sizes .",
    "a gaussian profile is a standard choice and is appropriate for this initial test .",
    "investigations to identify a better profile and size of the artificial psf will be part of future work to further develop the era method .",
    "parameters used in this test are as described below .",
    "we used the following parameters for the simulation test .",
    "the profile of the lensed image is assumed to be [ gaussian , cersic n=4 ] with an ellipticity @xmath75(0.3,0.0 ) and the size is set based on the condition that the maximum sn radius is @xmath76 pixels .",
    "this size is larger than the standard image used in real analysis , because we would like to avoid the effect of pixelization in this test .",
    "the ellipticity of the psf @xmath77=[(0.0 , 0.0 ) , ( 0.1 , 0.1 ) , ( 0.3 , 0.0 ) , ( -0.6 , -0.6 ) ] and psf size ratio to gaussian weight size of the lensed image is @xmath78[0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 ] .",
    "the first step of the simulation is to make images .",
    "the lensed and psf images are made with assigned parameters , and we then make the smeared image @xmath79 in fourier space from the lensed and psf images .",
    "psf corrections proceed as follows :    * deconvolution : deconvolve the smeared image @xmath79 by the psf image @xmath80 for making deconvolved image @xmath81 , and measure ellipticity of the deconvolved image , where we use a sufficiently small deconvolution constant ( @xmath82 ) ( in this test we do not have noise and thus we can take an arbitrarily small deconvolution constant ) . *",
    "method a : re - smear the deconvolved image @xmath81 by @xmath83 for making @xmath67 , and measure the ellipticity of @xmath67 which has same ellipticity as @xmath83 . to find the ellipticity of @xmath83",
    ", we use an iterative technique .",
    "the initial choice of the ellipticity for @xmath83 is that of @xmath79 , and then smear @xmath84 to make @xmath67 .",
    "then , the measured ellipticity of the @xmath67 is used as the ellipticity of @xmath83 in the next iteration ( i.e. @xmath85 in n - th iteration ) .",
    "* method b : re - smear the smeared image @xmath79 and psf image @xmath80 by @xmath86 for making @xmath67 and @xmath83 .",
    "to find the ellipticity of @xmath86 , we use the following iterative technique .",
    "the initial choice of the ellipticity for @xmath86 is again that of @xmath79 to make @xmath67 and @xmath83 .",
    "these ellipticities do not coincide in general , then the difference is added for the initial choice of the ellipticity for @xmath86 in the second step and so on ( i.e. @xmath87 in n - th iteration ) .    as a comment on the iterative techniques used in methods a and b , we believe that the iterative methods used are standard , but it is important to find a faster and more robust method which will be part of future studies .",
    "next , we test the following seven cases .",
    "deconvolution : standard deconvolution where we use a small deconvolution constant , which is not realistic due to pixel noise effect , * \\2 .",
    "method a1 : size of @xmath83 is the same as the psf @xmath88 , * \\3 .",
    "method a2 : size of @xmath83 is 2 times as large as the psf @xmath88 , * \\4 .",
    "method a3 : size of @xmath83 is 3 times as large as the psf @xmath88 , * \\5",
    ". method b1 : size of @xmath86 is the same size as @xmath88 , * \\6 .",
    "method b2 : size of @xmath86 is the same size as @xmath79 .",
    "ksb method : psf correction using the ksb method .",
    "figures [ fig : g_0_0a ] to [ fig : s_6_6b ] show the psf corrected ellipticities .",
    "the conditions of the lensed images and psf are shown in each caption .",
    "fig.[fig : g_0_0a ] , fig.[fig : g_0_0b ] , fig.[fig : s_0_0a ] and fig.[fig : s_0_0b ] show the results with an isotropic psf , and fig.[fig : g_1_1a ] , fig.[fig : g_1_1b ] , fig.[fig : s_1_1a ] and fig.[fig : s_1_1b ] show the results with a small elliptical psf .",
    "these results show that the standard deconvolution method has a systematic error in some situations , e.g. when there is a large psf , and the ksb method overestimates in all situations .",
    "in contrast , method a and method b correct the psf with systematic errors of about 0.01% or lower .",
    "moreover , the error can be reduced with more iterations .",
    "fig.[fig : g_3_0a ] , fig.[fig : g_3_0b ] , fig.[fig : s_3_0a ] and fig.[fig : s_3_0b ] show that all methods have no systematic errors , because the ellipticity of the lensed images and that of the psf have the same value , so the psf acts as @xmath83 and we do not need the psf correction .",
    "however , because ksb corrects both anisotropic and isotropic psf , the ksb method has a systematic error .",
    "fig.[fig : g_6_6a ] , fig.[fig : g_6_6b ] , fig.[fig : s_6_6a ] and fig.[fig : s_6_6b ] show the results with a large elliptical psf . in real lensing analysis ,",
    "such a large elliptical psf is rare or we should discard such data , however , this sort of test is valuable to understand the details of this new method .",
    "these results show that the deconvolution and ksb methods are not able to sufficiently correct such a large ellipticity of the psf .",
    "psf corrections with a small re - smearing function in method a have a systematic error . method a makes the re - smeared image from the deconvolved image , resulting in a large systematic error with the deconvolved method . method b1 with a psf size 0.5 can not correct the psf because a high ellipticity ( nearly 1 ) is needed for the re - smearing function @xmath86 .",
    "method b2 has a larger re - smearing function than method b1 , so method b2 can correct the psf with a smaller ellipticity for @xmath86 than method b1 .",
    "this indicates we have to choose the size of re - smearing function carefully when the psf has a large size and large ellipticity .",
    "we obtained similar results using different ellipticity of the lensed image @xmath75(0.1,0.0 ) and ( 0.5,0.0 ) .",
    "all figures show that method a3 and method b2 can correct the psf in all situations , meaning that the era method with a large re - smearing function can correct the psf .",
    "however we note that re - smearing by a re - smearing function that is too large , makes a large artificial image and longer time is needed to measure the moments of this large artificial image .    however , it is important to find more appropriate profiles and sizes for @xmath83 to have faster analyses , and it is also necessary to find a more effective numerical iteration scheme .",
    "these problems will be studied in the future .",
    "we have developed the era method with a possible new psf correction method for weak gravitational lensing shear analysis .",
    "the idea is to construct an artificial image with the same ellipticity as the lensed image by re - smearing the observed image .",
    "this approach avoids the approximations in psf corrections of previous moments method ( i.e. eq.[eq : ksbap ] ) , therefore there is no systematic error from psf correction if we choose an appropriate function for re - smearing .",
    "then , we tested the method with simple simulated images .",
    "the results of the simulation are as follows .",
    "the deconvolution method can not estimate ellipticity correctly , because deconvolution is not perfect when smearing using a large or high elliptical psf .",
    "the ksb method has systematic errors which cause overestimation in the standard situation ( in the simulation , it is about 2 - 3% , but it depends on the ellipticity of the image and the size of the psf , etc . ) , and is not able to correct the smearing effect with a high elliptical psf .",
    "however , methods a and b are both able to estimate the ellipticity correctly if the psf has standard ellipticity .",
    "we also confirmed that re - smearing the deconvolved image ( method a3 ) and re - smearing the smeared image ( method b2 ) have no systematic error in psf correction even if the size and the ellipticity of psf are large .    although the tests performed here are not entirely realistic , the results are very encouraging",
    ". further studies of systematic errors based on realistic data , ( e.g. pixel noise , pixelization etc . ) are needed .",
    "in particular , pixel noise has the potential to make large systematic errors ( see e - holics part3 ) .",
    "for example , in measuring cosmic shear , galaxies in high redshift bins are relatively faint and have lower signal to noise ratio , and thus they suffer from more systematic bias due to pixel noise than those at lower redshifts .",
    "thus , the measured shear for high - z galaxies would be underestimated .",
    "it is also important to find a more appropriate profile for the re - smearing function and to develop more effective iteration schemes which will result in faster analyses .",
    "future planed surveys such as euclid and lsst will treat an enormous number of galaxies and thus not only low systematic errors but also fast analyses are essential .",
    "these problems will be approached in future studies ."
