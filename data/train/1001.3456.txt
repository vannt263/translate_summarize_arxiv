    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are variable x - ray sources which are not coincident with the nucleus of the galaxy and exhibit luminosities over the eddington limit of a 20 @xmath2 black hole ( @xmath3  ) assuming isotropic emission .",
    "they are too bright to be powered by accretion onto stellar mass black holes like galactic black hole binaries ( bhbs ) and are thus candidates of intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) . however ,",

    "low frequency qpos from mhz to several tens hz have been found in galactic bhbs . on the basis of their properties like the coherence , amplitude , phase lag , and harmonic component , low frequency qpos can be classified into three types of a , b and c @xcite .",

    "for example , the type c qpos in grs 1915 + 105 are detected at frequencies of as low as 1 mhz @xcite .",
    "qpos have been detected in two ulxs , and are argued to be of type c @xcite because they appear to vary in a manner similar to type c qpos in galactic bhbs . scaling the compact object mass with the oscillation frequency indicates the presence of imbhs in these two ulxs @xcite .",

    "prominent timing noise above the poisson level can be seen around a few mhz in the power spectra from these observations ( figure  [ fig : pow ] ) , which we interpret as qpos .",

    "observation 5644 has an exposure of 70 ks and the source luminosity was @xmath62  in 1 - 8 kev .",
    "the number of photons from  detected in 5644 is as many as in 6097 , and twice that in 10027 ; the nondetection of qpos is not due to low statistics .",
    "observation 2933 and 6361 both have an exposure of 18 ks and the source luminosity was @xmath63 and @xmath64  , respectively . another four acis observations ( 378 , 379 , 380 - 1 and 380 - 2 ) are shorter than 10 ks , and the source was slightly dimmer than in observation 2933 .",
    "the mhz qpos were not detected in any observation when the source was dim , below @xmath65  .",
    "low frequency qpos in stellar mass black hole x - ray binaries have a diverse population distributed in a wide frequency range .",
    "therefore , inference of the compact object mass via the qpo frequency should be done between qpos of the same type .",
    "the qpo coherence parameter @xmath66 , defined as the ratio of the central frequency to the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , is around 1.4 - 1.5 derived from the three chandra observations and nearly 4 from the xmm observation 0112290201 .",
    "the rms amplitude of the qpos in the three chandra observations is high , from 10% to 17% , but is relatively low in the xmm observation 0112290201 of 5% .",
    "we note that the chandra results should be more reliable due to less contamination .",
    "as mentioned above , possible red noise is only found in chandra 6097 , and the power spectrum is totally dominated by the white noise in the other two observations at frequencies down to 0.1 or even 0.01 mhz .",
    "therefore , the qpos in  can be summarized as being broad and strong , and occurring with absent or weak red noise continuum .",
    "the qpos in  are similar to four qpos detected in xte j1550@xmath1564 on 1999 mar 18 and 21 and apr 02 and 03 , respectively , which also have a low @xmath66 of about 1.0 , an rms amplitude of about 10% , and accompanied with a weak red noise @xcite .",
    "another similarity is that three out of the four qpos in xte j1550@xmath1564 do not exhibit a lorentz profile .",
    "these four qpos were classified as ` possible ' type a qpos by @xcite , or type a - i ( a subclass of type a ) by @xcite to distinguish them from weak type a qpos .",
    "@xcite argued that type a - i qpos should be classified as type b based on their frequency and amplitude .",
    "however , type b qpos are usually narrow , with a @xmath66 value of @xmath67 concluded from a few bhbs @xcite .",
    "therefore , the type a - i could be a special subclass amid type a and type b. in spite of the controversy over the classification of type a - i , we identify the qpos found in  as of type a - i based on their similar profile and the weak / absent red noise , or conservatively , of type a / b according to the discussion above . as noted above , the mhz qpos were detected only when the source was luminous , above @xmath68@xmath0  .",
    "type a / b qpos show identical behavior that they appear only when the source flux is high enough @xcite .",
    "this further supports the identification of the mhz qpos as of type a / b . by any means , the qpos in  are not analogous to type c , which are narrow , strong , and accompanied by a strong red noise continuum ; otherwise , the following discussion would be different as type c qpos appear at a frequency range significantly wider than others .",
    "the four type a - i qpos in xte j1550@xmath1564 have a central frequency varying between 7.1 to 10.3 hz ; all type a qpos in xte j1550@xmath1564 are found in a frequency range of 4.88 - 10.3 hz , which covers the frequency range of type b qpos ( 4.94 - 6.1 hz ) in the same source @xcite .",
    "the qpos in  have a central frequency between 2.77 - 3.98 mhz . comparing with the type a - i qpos in xte j1550@xmath1564 ,",
    "the upper and lower bounds of the frequency range have exactly the same ratio but scaled by a factor of about 2600 .",
    "based on the assumption of type a - i qpos , the compact object mass of  can be inferred as 25,000 - 30,00 @xmath2 after adopting a mass of 9.68 - 11.58 @xmath2 for xte j1550@xmath1564 @xcite . a more conservative estimate taking into account all type a / b qpos leads to a black hole mass of 12,000 - 43,000 @xmath2 in , inferred from the possibly smallest and largest ratios between qpo frequencies from the two sources .",
    "type a / b qpos are detected in several other bhbs besides xte j1550@xmath1564 , including gx 339@xmath14 , xte j1859 + 226 , and gs 1124@xmath1684 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in these sources , the type a",
    "/ b qpos show up in a similar frequency range , e.g.  4.5 - 7.49 hz in gx 339@xmath14 @xcite and 4.45 - 8.42 hz in xte j1859 + 226 @xcite .",
    "type b qpos are also detected in grs 1915 + 105 varying in the frequency range of 2.44 - 6.84 hz @xcite .",
    "they are broad but shown above a strong red noise component , partially similar to the qpos in .",
    "these sources also contains a similar massive black hole as in xte j1550@xmath1564 , but their masses are not as well constrained as in the latter @xcite .",
    "therefore , inferring the mass of  via type a / b qpos from these sources will lead to consistent but looser constraints .",
    "we note that all above estimates of the mass depend on a hypothesis that the frequency of type a / b qpos is linearly scaled with the black hole mass , which , however , has never been tested . more work regarding the mass dependence of type a / b qpos is needed .    in gx 339@xmath14 , all type a / b qpos were detected when the source was in the soft intermediate state @xcite , also known as the steep power - law state defined by @xcite . in xte j1550@xmath1564 , the four type",
    "a - i qpos were found in the steep power - law state as well @xcite . however , the x - ray spectrum of  is hard , seemingly inconsistent with the steep power - law state .",
    "disk emission is detected in observation 8190 , with a moderate fraction of 27% in 1 - 8 kev .",
    "this disk component will contribute 40% to the total emission below 1 mev if the power - law component is not cut off .",
    "in the hard state , the disk contributes less than 25% in 2 - 20 kev for stellar mass black holes .",
    "for more massive black holes , though there is no defined energy range , a disk fraction of 27%-40% seems too high for being classified as in the hard state .",
    "a varying disk component and an energetic power - law component suggest that the source may be in a state similar to the steep power - law state in stellar mass black holes .",
    "interestingly , the best - fit disk inner radius is consistent with the gravitational radius of a black hole of 11,000 - 44,000 @xmath2 , which is in agreement with the mass estimated from the qpo frequency",
    ".    lies about @xmath4 from the kinematic center of m82 @xcite on the sky plane . following the discussion in @xcite and references therein ,",
    "an upper limit of the compact object mass can be placed of about @xmath69 @xmath2 such that the black hole will not fall onto the nucleus of the galaxy due to dynamical friction if the black hole was born at the same time of the galaxy .",
    "this upper limit is consistent with our mass estimate via qpos .",
    "is coincident with an extended radio source known as 42.21 + 59.2 , which is believed to be an h ii region @xcite associated with a star cluster seen from infrared @xcite .",
    "therefore , it could be ruled out that the source is a background agn .",
    "if the disk component is true , its high bolometric luminosity of @xmath70  and low temperature make it a good candidate for the ionization source of the h ii region .",
    "the outburst luminosity of the source is about @xmath0  . in the total 20 observations of the source ( 16 reported in",
    "* plus chandra 8190 , 10027 , 10025 , and 10026 ) ,  was found active in 12 of them , indicative of a duty cycle @xmath71 . assuming an accretion efficiency @xmath72 , the mean mass accretion rate of the source is found to be @xmath73 g s@xmath6 .",
    "if the source is accreting from the interstellar medium directly , the mass accretion rate in g  s@xmath6 can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath57 is the black hole mass , @xmath75 is density and @xmath76 is the speed of sound of the medium @xcite .",
    "adopting canonical values of the density and sound speed shown in the equation , a black hole mass of @xmath77 @xmath2 is required to power the x - ray luminosity without a companion star .",
    "this means that if the mass estimated from the qpos are reliable , the source does not have to be in a close binary system , but is massive enough to accrete from the interstellar medium directly .",
    "@xcite suggests that the bondi rate may overestimate the true accretion rate for agns by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude . in this case",
    ", a corresponding higher black hole mass would be required .",
    "conversely , if the ulx indeed lies within a star cluster , the gas density could be substantially higher , which would decrease the required black hole mass .",
    "anyway , one should be cautious of the high uncertainty on such an estimate .",
