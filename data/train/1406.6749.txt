    "the purpose of this paper is to study the long - short waves ( lsw ) equation , which reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the envelope of the short wave and @xmath6 represents the amplitude of the long wave .",
    "as an integrable system , this equation has been widely studied by many methods such as inverse scattering transformation , painlev analysis , bcklund and darboux transformation @xcite .",
    "we note that long wave - short wave resonance can be achieved in a second - order nonlinear negative refractive index medium when the short wave lies on the negative index branch @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that ( [ a1 ] ) is associated with a model equation proposed by yajima and oikawa through a muira transformation .",
    "the @xmath1-dressing method @xcite is a powerful tools to construct and solve integrable nonlinear equations , moreover , it can also describes their transformations and reductions @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the lsw equation in virtue of extended @xmath1-dressing method @xcite and give their @xmath7-soliton solution .",
    "in sect.2 , using the @xmath1-dressing method , we obtain the lax pair for the lsw equation . in sect.3 ,",
    "suitable symmetry conditions are applied to derive the lsw equation in both cases @xmath2 . in sect.4 ,",
    "the soliton solutions for the lsw equation for @xmath2 are given , moreover , the explicit expression of @xmath7-soliton solution is found for this equation by means of the properties of cauchy matrix .",
    "we note that for the lsw equation with @xmath3 , we obtain the one and two cusp solitons which are singular spiky soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "in this section , we consider the @xmath0 matrix @xmath1-problem in the complex @xmath8-plane @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a spectral transform matrix associated with a nonlinear equation .",
    "it is easy to see that a solution of the @xmath1-problem ( [ b1 ] ) with the canonical normalization can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the cauchy - green integral operator acting on the left @xmath13 and here we have suppressed the variable @xmath14 dependence in @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the aim of the @xmath1-dressing method is to construct the compatible system of linear equations for @xmath15 and the nonlinear evolution equations associated with the @xmath1-problem ( [ b1 ] ) . according to the idea of the inverse scattering transform method , it is important to introduce the @xmath17 dependence in the spectral transform matrix @xmath18 . for the lsw equation ( [ a1 ] )",

    "in order to derive the lsw equation , we differentiate @xmath26 in ( [ b19 ] ) with respect to @xmath35 , and use the properties of the @xmath21-problem ( [ b1 ] ) , then @xcite @xmath36=[j,\\langle\\bar\\partial(k^2u)\\rangle],\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 furthermore , from the linear spectral problem ( [ b19 ] ) , we find @xmath39+[q , u].\\ ] ]    on the other hand , equations ( [ c4 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) imply that @xmath40 has the following asymptotic expansion @xmath41 then equation ( [ c1 ] ) reduces to @xmath42\\\\ = & [ j,\\langle\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^\\infty u_j(x , t)\\pi\\delta(k)\\delta_{j,3}\\rangle]\\\\ = & -[j , u_3(x , t ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in view of the identity @xmath43 .",
