    "the quantum information theory in the relativistic framework has received considerable attention due to its theoretical importance and practical application @xcite .",
    "especially , more and more efforts have been expended on the study of quantum entanglement in a relativistic setting because people consider the entanglement to be a major resource for quantum information tasks such as quantum teleportation , quantum computation and so on @xcite . with the intention of studying the entanglement between accelerated observers , the fidelity of teleportation between two parties in relative uniform acceleration",
    "was discussed by alsing _",
    "xian - hui ge _ et al . _ extended the gravitational field of the teleportation to the four and higher dimensional spacetimes , and even explicitly discussed what effects the shape of the cavity in which particles are confined has on the teleportation in a black hole spacetime @xcite . in order to further investigate the observer - dependent character of the entanglement , fuentes - schuller _ et al .",
    "_ analyzed the entanglement between two modes of a non - interacting massless scalar field when one of the observers describing the state is uniformly accelerated @xcite . and then alsing _ et al . _",
    "calculated the entanglement between two modes of a free dirac field described by relatively accelerated parties in a flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "their results @xcite also showed that the different type of field will have a qualitatively different effect on the degradation of entanglement produced by the unruh effect @xcite . more recently ,",
    "_ extended the investigation to the entanglement of a two - mode squeezed state in riemannian spacetime @xcite , yi ling _",
    "_ discussed the entanglement of electromagnetic field in noninertial reference frames @xcite , and adesso _ et al .",
    "_ investigated the distribution of entanglement between modes of a free scalar field from the perspective of observers in uniform acceleration @xcite .",
    "as a further step along this line , we will provide an analysis of the entanglement for the scalar field in the spacetime of a most general , static and asymptotically flat black hole with spherical symmetry .",
    "it seems to be an interesting study to consider the influences of the hawking effect @xcite on the quantum entangled states and show how the hawking temperature will change the properties of the entanglement and teleportation . choosing a generically entangled state as the initially entangled state for two observers in the flat region of this black hole",
    ", we will also try to see what effects the uncertain entangled state will have on the degradation of entanglement in our scheme due to the presence of an arbitrary state parameter .",
    "our scheme proposes that the two observers , alice and bob , share an initially entangled state at the same initial point in flat minkowski spacetime before the black hole is formed .",
    "after the coincidence of alice and bob , alice stays stationary at the asymptotically flat region , while bob falls in toward the mass and then hovers outside of it .",
    "once bob is safely hovering outside of the object at some constant acceleration , let it collapse to form a black hole .",
    "by birkhoff s theorem @xcite this wo nt change the metric outside of the black hole and therefore wo nt change bob s acceleration .",
    "thus , bob s detector registers only thermally excited particles due to the hawking effect @xcite . in order to investigate the teleportation between two modes of a scalar field as detected by the two observers",
    ", we assume that alice and bob each hold an optical cavity which is small and perfect for the teleportation in the black hole spacetime . just as suggested by refs .",
    "@xcite , we further suppose that each cavity supports two orthogonal modes , with the same frequency , which are each excited to a single photon fock state at the coincidence point for alice and bob .",
    "different from the standard teleportation protocol , our scheme assumes that bob hovers outside of the object before it collapses , and turns on his detector after the formation of the black hole .",
    "then , bob can check to see whether any thermal photons have been excited in his local cavity using the non - absorbing detector .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we discuss the vacuum structure of the background spacetime and the hawking effect for the scalar particles as experienced by the observer outside the black hole . in sec .",
    "3 we analyze the effects of the hawking temperature on the entanglement between the modes for the different state parameter . in sec .",
    "4 we describe the process of the teleportation between alice and bob , and calculate the fidelity of teleportation .",
    "we summarize and discuss our conclusions in the last section .",
    "it is well known that the spherically symmetric line element of a static and asymptotically flat black hole such as schwarzschild black hole , reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite , garfinkle - horowitz - strominger dilaton black hole @xcite , casadio - fabbri - mazzacurati ( cfm ) brane black hole @xcite and so on can be written in the form @xmath2 where the functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 vanish at the event horizon @xmath5 of the black hole . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath6 .",
    "it is obvious that the surface gravity of the event horizon is determined by @xmath7 . defining the tortoise",
    "coordinates @xmath8 as @xmath9 , we can rewrite the metric ( [ metric ] ) as @xmath10    the massless scalar field @xmath11 satisfies the klein - gordon equation @xmath12 after expressing the normal mode solution as @xcite @xmath13 we can easily get the radial equation @xmath14\\chi_{\\omega l}=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath15+\\frac{l(l+1)f(r)}{r^{2}(r)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a scalar spherical harmonic on the unit twosphere . solving eq .",
    "( [ radial equation ] ) near the event horizon , we obtain the incoming wave function which is analytic everywhere in the spacetime manifold @xcite @xmath17 and the outgoing wave functions for the inside and outside region of the event horizon @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "( [ inside mode ] ) and ( [ outside mode ] ) are analytic inside and outside the event horizon respectively , so they form a complete orthogonal family . in second - quantizing the field @xmath22 in the exterior of the black hole",
    "we can expand it as follows @xcite @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the annihilation and creation operators acting on the vacuum of the interior region of the black hole , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the annihilation and creation operators acting on the vacuum of the exterior region respectively .",
    "thus , the fock vacuum state can be defined as @xmath28    introducing the generalized light - like kruskal coordinates @xcite @xmath29 and noticing that near the event horizon @xmath30 we can obtain a complete basis of the outgoing modes according to the suggestion of damour - ruffini @xcite @xmath31 @xmath32 thus , we can also quantize the quantum field @xmath22 in terms of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the kruskal spacetime as @xmath35^{-1/2}[a_{out,\\omega lm}\\psi_{i,\\omega lm}+a^{\\dag}_{out,\\omega lm}\\psi^{*}_{i,\\omega lm}\\nonumber \\\\ & + & a_{in,\\omega lm}\\psi_{ii,\\omega lm}+a^{\\dag}_{in,\\omega lm}\\psi^{*}_{ii,\\omega lm } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the annihilation operator @xmath36 can be used to define the kruskal vacuum outside the event horizon @xmath37    according to eqs .",
    "( [ first expand ] ) and ( [ second expand ] ) , we obtain the bogoliubov transformations @xcite for the particle creation and annihilation operators in the black hole and kruskal spacetimes @xmath38 we assume that the kruskal vacuum @xmath39 is related to the vacuum of the black hole @xmath40 by @xmath41 from @xmath42=[b_{out,\\omega lm},b^{\\dag}_{out,\\omega lm}]=1 $ ] and eq .",
    "( [ kruskal vacuum ] ) , we get @xcite @xmath43 after properly normalizing the state vector , we obtain the kruskal vacuum which is a maximally entangled two - mode squeezed state @xcite @xmath44 and the first excited state @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the orthonormal bases for the inside and outside region of the event horizon respectively . for the observer outside the black hole , he needs to trace over the modes in the interior region since he has no access to the information in this causally disconnected region .",
    "therefore , when an outside observer travels through the kruskal particle vacuum @xmath39 of mode @xmath48 his detector registers a number of particles given by @xmath49 where we have defined the hawking temperature as @xcite @xmath50 eq .",
    "( [ hawking ] ) is well known as the hawking effect @xcite , which shows that the observer in the exterior of the black hole detects a thermal bose - einstein distribution of particles as he traverses the kruskal vacuum .",
    "now we assume that alice has a detector which only detects mode @xmath51 and bob has a detector sensitive only to mode @xmath52 , and they share a generically entangled state at the same initial point in flat minkowski spacetime before the black hole is formed @xmath53 where @xmath0 is some real number which satisfies @xmath54 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the so - called  normalized partners \" .",
    "after the coincidence of alice and bob , alice remains at the asymptotically flat region but bob freely falls in toward the mass with his detector and then hovers outside of it before it collapses to form a black hole .",
    "obviously , there will be some thermal effects due to changes in bob s acceleration , but there will be no hawking radiation . note that such effects can be negligible , or at least will disperse after some time .",
    "then , once bob is safely hovering outside of the object at some constant acceleration , let it collapse to form a black hole . by birkhoff s theorem @xcite this wo nt change the metric outside of the black hole and therefore wo nt change bob s acceleration .",
    "thus , bob s detector registers only thermally excited particles due to the hawking effect @xcite .",
    "the states corresponding to mode @xmath52 must be specified in the coordinates of the black hole in order to describe what bob sees in this curved spacetime .",
    "thus , using eqs .",
    "( [ scalar - vacuum ] ) and ( [ scalar - excited ] ) , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) in terms of minkowski modes for alice and black hole modes for bob .",
    "since bob is causally disconnected from the interior region of the black hole , we will take the trace over the states in this region and obtain the mixed density matrix between alice and bob in exterior region @xmath55 .",
    "it should be noted that we do not trace over the states located inside the event horizon for alice , even though she now is also causally disconnected from the interior region of the black hole . as a matter of fact",
    ", the causal structure of spacetime keeps every observer exterior from the black hole disconnected from its interior . why do we not trace over the degree of freedom of alice in the region inaccessible to her",
    "we now present the reasons as follows . on the one hand",
    ", we can justify what we are doing by theory . for a schwarzschild black hole",
    ", the mass of which is assumed to be of the order of a solar mass ( @xmath56 ) , the magnitude of acceleration near this black hole that bob needs is about @xmath57 , which is much larger than that of alice needs ( almost equals to zero ) in the asymptotical region .",
    "thus , we argue that alice s acceleration effects can be neglected , whereas bob s ca nt . on the other hand , we can think about it from experiment . though we do not observe the black hole directly , impressive progress in optical , radio and @xmath58-ray astronomy greatly bolster the evidence for supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , the earth can be argued to be an asymptotical region far from black holes , as far as we know .",
    "the standard quantum field theory works fine for the earthbound experiments , so we have at least some circumstantial empirical evidence that tracing over the black hole interior can be neglected in asymptotical regions .",
    "it is clear that the partial transpose criterion provides a sufficient condition for the existence of entanglement in this case @xcite : if at least one eigenvalue of the partial transpose of the density matrix is negative , the density matrix is entangled ; but a state with positive partial transpose can still be entangled .",
    "it is well - known bound or nondistillable entanglement @xcite .",
    "interchanging alice s qubits @xmath59 , we get the matrix representation of the partial transpose in the ( @xmath60 ,  @xmath61 ) block @xmath62 and its eigenvalues @xmath63,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 .",
    "obviously the eigenvalue @xmath65 is always negative for finite value of the hawking temperature .",
    "hence , this mixed state is always entangled for any finite value of @xmath66 .",
    "it should be noted that in the limit @xmath67 , the negative eigenvalue will go to zero . in order to discuss this further",
    ", we will use the logarithmic negativity which serves as an upper bound on the entanglement of distillation @xcite .",
    "this entanglement monotone is defined as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the trace norm of the partial transpose @xmath70 .",

    ", the monotonous decrease of @xmath72 with increasing @xmath66 for five different @xmath0 means that the  initial entanglement \" is lost to the thermal fields generated by the hawking effect .",
    "this result agrees well with the hawking s original argument @xcite , which says that smaller black holes are at a higher temperature and so radiate more violently than massive black holes .",
    "[ negbos ] also shows that when the  initial entanglement \" is stronger , we lose it more rapidly .",
    "but it is surprisingly found that the same  initial entanglement \" for @xmath0 and its  normalized partner \" @xmath1 will be degraded along two different curves except for the maximally entangled state , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "this phenomenon , due to the coupling of @xmath0 and the exponential functions related to @xmath66 , just shows the inequivalence of the quantization for a scalar field in the black hole and kruskal spacetimes .",

    "it is interesting to note that except for the maximally entangled state , the same  initially mutual information \" for @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be degraded along two different trajectories .",

    "thus , we conclude that @xmath90 which is independent of the state parameter @xmath0 .",
    "obviously if @xmath88 is higher , it is degraded to a higher degree in this limit .",
    "since the distillable entanglement in the infinite hawking temperature limit is zero , we are safe to say that the total correlations consist of classical correlations plus bound entanglement in this limit .",
    "in this section we will concentrate on a particular quantum information task : quantum teleportation .",
    "we assume that alice and bob each hold an optical cavity , at rest in their local frame .",
    "each cavity supports two orthogonal modes ( labeled by @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath93 ) , with the same frequency , which are each excited to a single photon fock state at the coincidence point for alice and bob .",
    "we ignore the polarization of these modes and model the photons by the massless modes of a scalar field as suggested by refs .",
    "@xcite . considering the textbook teleportation protocol @xcite , we let alice and bob share a maximally entangled state , i.e. , an entangled bell state in flat minkowski spacetime @xmath94 where the logical states @xmath95 and @xmath96 are defined in terms of the physical fock states for alice s cavity by the dual - rail basis states @xcite @xmath97 and @xmath98 are single photon excitations of the minkowski vacuum states in alice s cavity .",
    "our construction implicitly assumes that we have chosen a modal decomposition of the minkowski vacuum based on intra - cavity and extra - cavity modes , which is a legitimate alternative to the usual way of quantizing the vacuum in terms of plane wave modes @xcite .",

    "this will allow alice to make a joint measurement on the two orthogonal modes of each cavity .",
    "for the usual teleportation protocol between two minkowski observers alice and bob , after alice s measurement , bob s state will be projected according to the measurement outcome .",
    "we can give the final state received by bob @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "once receiving the classical information of the result of alice s measurement , bob can apply a unitary transformation to verify the protocol .",
    "obviously the fidelity of the teleported state is unity in this idealized situation .",
    "alice now wishes to perform the same teleportation protocol with the noninertial observer bob .",
    "we assume that prior to their coincidence , alice and bob ensure that all photons are removed from their cavities .",
    "when alice and bob instantaneously share a maximally entangled state at the asymptotically flat region , we suppose that the two cavities overlap and simultaneously a four photon source excites a two photon state in each cavity .",
