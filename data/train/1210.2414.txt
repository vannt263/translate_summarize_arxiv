    "the _ planck_australia telescope compact array ( _ planck_-atca ) co - eval observations ( paco ) project consists in observations with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) of three _ complete _ samples drawn from the australia telescope 20 ghz ( at20 g ) catalogue ( murphy et al .",
    "2010 ; hancock et al .",
    "2011 ) in three pairs of 2ghz - wide bands ( 5.5 and 9ghz , 18 and 24ghz , 33 and 39ghz ) .",
    "the selected samples are : the ` bright paco sample ' including sources with @xmath15mjy ( massardi et al .",
    "2011b ) ; the ` faint paco sample ' ( bonavera et al .",
    "2011 ) going down to @xmath16mjy in the south ecliptic pole region ; and the ` spectrally - selected paco sample ' , presented in this paper .",
    "the paco observations were carried out in several epochs between july 2009 and august 2010 .",
    "at least one observation was made within 10 days from the _ planck _ satellite observations in any of the lfi channels ( 30 , 44 , 70ghz ) .",
    "observations and data reduction procedures have been presented in massardi et al .",
    "( 2011b ) . the comparison between paco data for all the samples and measurements in the _ planck _ early release compact source catalogue ( ercsc ; planck collaboration vii 2011 ) will be presented in massardi et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "a particularly interesting class of sources with spectra rising at frequencies above 5 ghz are the ` high frequency peakers ' ( hfps ; dallacasa et al .",
    "2000 ) , believed to be the most compact and youngest members of the gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) source family ( e.g. , odea  1998 ; tinti & de zotti  2006 ) .",
    "the first hfp selections ( dallacasa et al . 2000 ; stanghellini , dallacasa , & orienti 2009 ) had peak frequencies in the observer frame mostly in the range 510ghz .",
    "the at20 g survey offered the possibility of selecting complete samples of more extreme hfps , with spectral peaks above 10 ghz ( hancock et al .",
    "the well established correlation between intrinsic peak frequency , @xmath17 , and projected linear size ( odea 1998 ) indicates that @xmath1820ghz corresponds to scales @xmath19pc .",
    "multi - epoch vlba and vlbi observations of compact symmetric objects ( csos ) , as genuinely young hfp / gps sources are generally found to be ( orienti et al .",
    "2006 ; orienti & dallacasa 2012 ) , showed sub - relativistic expansion velocities , frequently of 0.1@xmath20 ( gugliucci et al . 2005 ; polatidis 2009 ; an et al .",
    "thus the at20 g hfps are expected to have ages of a few hundred years and therefore to give us an insight on the initial stages of radio activity .",
    "the available data indicate that these early phases are characterised by high luminosity , fast evolution in size and peak frequency ( begelman 1996 ; dallacasa 2003 ; tinti & de zotti 2006 ) , and must therefore be very rare .",
    "only very large area , high frequency surveys , such as the at20 g that covers the entire southern sky , can thus provide statistically significant samples or constraints .    a peaked spectral shape , however , does not guarantee that a source is truly young .",
    "beamed radio sources ( blazars ) can also show peaked spectra when a flaring synchrotron component , self - absorbed up to high frequencies , dominates the emission spectrum .",
    "but the latter sources change their spectral shape keeping convex spectra for a relatively short time and may show a flat spectrum when re - observed after a few years , and anyway exhibit substantial variability ( tinti et al . 2005 ; torniainen et al .",
    "in contrast , truly young sources maintain their convex spectra and show low or undetectable variability , apart from the spectral evolution associated to the source expansion ( orienti , dallacasa , & stanghellini 2010 ) .",
    "thus multi - epoch , multi - frequency observations of peaked spectrum sources proved to be very effective in discriminating among the two populations .",
    "we use the variability properties between at20 g ( 20042007 ) and paco ( 20092010 ) epochs to discriminate between young sources and blazars .",
    "our search for hfp candidates differs from the earlier study by hancock et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , also based on the at20 g survey , in several respects .",
    "we start from a complete flux limited sample selected over the whole southern sky , while the sample by hancock et al .",
    "has no well defined flux density limit and is restricted to the region @xmath21 . also , their variability threshold for hfp candidates is mostly based on data at a single frequency ( 20 ghz ) on relatively short timescales ( 13 yr ) , while we have multi - frequency data on somewhat longer timescales ( typically 24 yr , but up to 6 yr ) . on the other hand , hancock et al .",
    "obtained radio observations also at 95 ghz ( while paco observations span the range 540 ghz ) as well as optical imaging and spectroscopy of a subset of their sources .",
    "as for blazars , the combination of at20 g and paco data can constrain the duration of high frequency flares and the distribution of their peak frequencies .    the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : sample ] we describe the data for the spectrally - selected paco sample . in  [ sec : blaz_vs_gps ] and in  [ sec : blazars ] we discuss candidate hfps and candidate blazars , respectively . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarise our main results .",
    "the spectrally - selected ( ss ) paco sample comprises all the 69 sources with @xmath22mjy and spectra classified in the at20 g catalogue ( massardi et al .",
    "2011a ) as inverted or upturning in the frequency range 4.820ghz , selected over the whole southern sky .",
    "these sources have been re - observed for the paco project between september 2009 and february 2010 , with a scheduling process optimised to allow observations at all the frequencies",
    "almost simultaneous ( i.e. within 10 days ) with the _ planck _ satellite .",
    "fifteen ss sources are also part of the faint paco sample ( @xmath22mjy , bonavera et al .",
    "2011 ) and 21 of the bright paco sample ( @xmath23mjy , massardi et al .",
    "2011b ) , including 6 sources in common with the faint sample .",
    "the atca observations of each source over the frequency range 540 ghz have been carried out in the same day but , due to bad weather conditions , in one case ( j173340 - 793555 ) a complete spectrum for the source has been obtained by joining the observations done in two subsequent days .",
    "the spectra of two other sources ( j040019 - 225624 and j184827 - 735337 ) are not reliable as the sources turned out to be extended while the flux estimation relies on the point - like assumption",
    ". data on these two sources are presented in the catalogue but not included in the analysis , so hereafter we consider a sample of 67 sources .    the classification of massardi et al .",
    "( 2011a ) has been done by considering two spectral indices ] : @xmath24 , between 4.86 and 8.56ghz , and @xmath25 , between 8.56 and 19.9ghz . at the time of the at20",
    "g observations the sample was defined by having @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( `` inverted '' ) or @xmath28 and @xmath27 ( `` upturning '' ) , after having excluded the sources with both @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( `` flat '' ) .",
    "we have redone this classification using the paco measurements over the 512 mhz - wide sub - bands centred at the frequencies nearest to the at20 g ones ( 4.732 , 8.744 and 18.768ghz ) .",
    "the best quality paco measurements , i.e. those referring to the epoch at which the highest accuracy was achieved ( due to the combination of good weather , minimal radio interferences and instrumental malfunctions , etc . ) , were selected for this purpose .",
    "as illustrated by fig.[fig : color - color_at20 g ] a large fraction of the sample has significantly modified its spectral behaviour , moving to the `` flat - spectrum '' region of the diagram .",
    "this already shows that the majority of sources in the ss sample are blazars , caught in a bright stage by the at20 g survey , that decayed to a more quiescent phase at the time of paco observations , i.e. on a timescale of a few to several years .",
    "we will come back to this in sec.[sec : blaz_vs_gps ] , when we will discuss the selection of `` genuine '' hfp sources .     versus @xmath31 ) of the sources in the ss paco sample .",
    "green triangles : at20 g data on which the sample selection was made ; black diamonds : paco data .",
    "the dotted lines show the @xmath32 and @xmath33 axes and the region defined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 contains sources classified as ` flat - spectrum ' by massardi et al .",
    "( 2011a).,width=264 ]      as a first step we have checked whether the spectra of our sources can be adequately described , over the full frequency range 540 ghz , by the double power - law @xmath34,\\ ] ] used by massardi et al .",

    "( 2011 ) for the bright and faint paco sample , respectively .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are free parameters .",
    "such a smooth spectrum may not necessarily fit the data for blazars whose radio emission results from the superposition of peaked spectra of several parts of the jet racing towards the observer at highly relativistic speeds and self - absorbed up to different frequencies ( e.g. de zotti et al .",
    "the fit has been performed in logarithmic units by minimising the @xmath39 with a nonlinear optimisation technique based on an implementation of the generalised reduced gradient optimisation method .",
    "unless otherwise noted , the results reported below refer to the `` best quality '' paco spectra ( see  [ sec : selection ] ) .",
    "we have considered as bad fits those with @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are mean and standard deviation of the gaussian fit of the reduced @xmath39 distribution over the whole paco sample .",
    "those are respectively @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we note that , in general , the @xmath39 values associated to the best fits are relatively high .",
    "this is due to the fact that , over the wide frequency range considered , the observed spectra show some small roughness , detected by our high accuracy measurements , so that a smooth function can not provide a perfect fit .",
    "still , the double power - law fits look acceptable for most sources ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : gps][fig : blaz_fl ] ) .    for the ss sample ,",
    "the double power - law model has been accepted for 57 out of 67 sources , i.e. in 85% of the cases . for them",
    "we have computed low- ( 510ghz ) and high - frequency ( 3040ghz ) spectral indices based on the fit and found that they fall in the following spectral categories :    * `` peaked '' : @xmath45 , @xmath46 ; 20 sources ( 30% ) * `` down - turning '' : @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; 26 sources ( 39% ) * `` self - absorbed '' : @xmath49 ) ; 7 sources ( 10% ) * `` flat '' with @xmath50 , @xmath51 : 4 sources ( 6% ) .",
    "no source switched from `` inverted '' or `` upturning '' according to the at20 g data to `` steep '' ( @xmath52 , @xmath46 ) according to the paco observations . nor any source kept an `` inverted '' spectrum ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) up to the highest frequencies in the paco range .",
    "a similar result was found for the bright and faint paco samples .",
    "the peak frequency @xmath54 can be derived from the fitting parameters as @xmath55 .",
    "the remaining 10 ( 15% ) sources have complex spectra ( see   [ sec : blazars ] ) : besides a main peak , they also exhibit a sort of plateau , which can either be at @xmath56 lower ( 6 sources ) or higher ( 4 sources ) than the peak frequency .",
    "this behaviour could be indicative of multiple emission components .",

    "@xmath68 the comparison between at20 g ( 2004 - 2008 ) and paco ( 2009 - 2010 ) measurements gives information on the source variability at @xmath69 , 8 , and 20 ghz ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) on typical timescales of @xmath734 years ( but of up to 6 years in some cases ) , while the comparison of paco measurements at different epochs informs on variability on a timescale of @xmath74 months , since they were coupled to the _ planck _ scans which have a @xmath75 month periodicity .",
    "the variability indices on the latter timescale have been computed , for all paco frequencies , selecting for each source the best ( smallest error bars ) pair of observations spaced by 6 months within @xmath76 .",
    "the median paco - at20 g and paco - paco variability indices and the associated errors are reported in table[tab : variability ] .",
    "the paco - at20 g variability of the ss sample turns out to be systematically higher than that found for the bright paco sample ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 for 5 , 8 and 20ghz respectively ; massardi et al .",
    "2011b ) , as expected since the ss sample contains a larger fraction of flaring objects .",
    "there is also a trend towards higher variability at higher frequencies , also found for the bright paco sample ( massardi et al .",

    "paco variability amplitude is similar to that found for the bright sample on the same timescale ( 6 months ) .",
    "no trend with frequency shows up in this case .",

    "one turns out to be the least variable . on the 6 months timescale",
    "their median variability index is in the range 1.67.6 , depending on frequency ; the median variability index of `` down - turning '' sources ranges from 6.4 to 15.0 and that of `` complex spectrum '' sources ranges from 4.7 to 17.9 . on the at20g  paco timescale ( 24 yr ) the median variability indices are in the range 910 , 1332 and 1540 for `` peaked '' , `` down - turning '' and `` complex spectrum '' sources , respectively .    for 15 out of the 20 `` peaked '' sources we could determine the timescale for the variation of @xmath54 in the source frame , @xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the peak frequency at the first epoch at which it could be determined , @xmath81 is its variation after a time @xmath82 , in the observer frame , and @xmath83 is the corresponding time lag in the source frame .",
    "the redshift @xmath84 was available for 3 out of the 15 sources ; for the remaining ones we used the median value over the candidate blazars of the sample having a redshift estimation ( @xmath85 ) .",

    "<S> the _ planck _ australia telescope compact array ( _ planck_-atca ) co - eval observations ( paco ) have provided multi - frequency ( 540 ghz ) flux density measurements of complete samples of australia telescope 20 ghz ( at20 g ) radio sources at frequencies below and overlapping with _ planck _ frequency bands , almost simultaneously with _ planck _ observations . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the data in total intensity for the spectrally - selected ( ss ) paco sample , a complete sample of 69 sources brighter than @xmath0mjy selected from the at20 g survey catalogue to be inverted or upturning between 5 and 20ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we study the spectral behaviour and variability of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we use the variability between at20 g ( 20042007 ) and paco ( 20092010 ) epochs to discriminate between candidate high frequency peakers ( hfps ) and candidate blazars . </S>",
    "<S> the hfps picked up by our selection criteria have spectral peaks @xmath1ghz in the observer frame and turn out to be rare ( @xmath2 of the @xmath3mjy sources ) , consistent with the short duration of this phase implied by the ` youth ' scenario . </S>",
    "<S> most ( @xmath4 ) of blazar candidates have remarkably smooth spectra , well described by a double power - law , suggesting that the emission in the paco frequency range is dominated by a single emitting region . </S>",
    "<S> sources with peaked paco spectra show a decrease of the peak frequency with time at a mean rate of @xmath5 on an average timescale of @xmath6yr ( median : @xmath7yr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 520 ghz spectral indices show a systematic decrease from at20 g to paco observations . at higher frequencies </S>",
    "<S> spectral indices steepen : the median @xmath8 is steeper than the median @xmath9 by @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> taking further into account the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) data we find that the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , @xmath11 , of most of our blazars peak at @xmath12ghz ; the median peak wavelength is @xmath13 m . </S>",
    "<S> only 6 have @xmath14ghz .    </S>",
