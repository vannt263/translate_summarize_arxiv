    "a recent experimental realization of single - layer graphene sheets @xcite has made it possible to confirm a number of theoretical predictions of intriguing electric properties of massless dirac fermion systems,@xcite including unconventional quantum hall effects ( qhe)@xcite with the half - integer hall conductivity@xcite _ xy = ( n + ) at @xmath0 , where a factor @xmath1 is the landau level ( ll ) degeneracy , accounting for spin and valley symmetry in graphene .",
    "@xmath2 is the filling factor , @xmath3 is the magnetic length , @xmath4 is the carrier density measured from charge neutral dirac point .",
    "in addition to these unconventional quantized values , which can be solely understood on the basis of the massless dirac fermion spectrum in a magnetic field : e_n = sgn(n)v_f^/_b , recent experimental studies in a sufficiently strong magnetic field revealed new quantum hall states at @xmath5,@xcite where the electron - electron interaction may play a crucial role . here",
    "relevant energy scales in graphene in a magnetic field are ( i ) landau level ( ll ) separation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8}[k]$ ] , ( ii ) zeeman coupling , @xmath9)[k]$ ] , and ( iii ) the coulomb energy , @xmath10}[k]$ ] .",
    "the activation energy measurements@xcite have shown that at @xmath11 the gap has linear @xmath12 dependence and reasonably corresponds to @xmath13 , indicating zeeman spin splitting . at @xmath14 , however , the gap is approximately scaled by @xmath15 , which indicates that the gap originates from the coulomb interaction .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical investigations of these states , and there are two leading theoretical scenarios for the origin of the gap .",
    "one is the quantum hall ferromagnetism ( qhf)@xcite in which valley degrees of freedom , referred to as pseudospins , spontaneously split via the exchange energy at _ all integer _",
    "fillings.@xcite second is the spontaneous mass generation,@xcite which predicts a gap _ only _ in the @xmath6 ll .",
    "although they are not entirely orthogonal to each other and the order parameters in the two theories can coexist,@xcite excitation properties , including the existence of gaps in @xmath16 lls , are different .    in the qhf theory , the ground state at @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the filling factor for @xmath19th landau level defined by _",

    "excitations from the symmetry broken states are described by ( pseudo)spin wave and ( pseudo)spin textures called skyrmions@xcite or other types , depending on the ll index @xmath19 .",
    "et al._@xcite estimated skyrmion excitation energy within the framework of hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation .",
    "the fractional quantum hall effects ( fqhe ) in graphene have been studied by apalkov and chakraborty@xcite . as a consequence of the relativistic nature of electrons in graphene ,",
    "the effective electron - electron interactions in @xmath16 lls differ from that of conventional two - dimensional systems.@xcite with the use of the exact diagonalizations they have calculated the magnetoroton energy at @xmath24 when spin and valley are fully polarized .",
    "their results show that the magnetoroton energy in the @xmath25 ll is larger than that in the @xmath6 ll in finite systems .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetoroton excitation is charge neutral and it is not connected to the charged gap which is necessary to realize the fqhe .",
    "moreover , the valley degrees of freedom which couple with charge excitations must be taken into account since there is no external symmetry breaking effect for valley degrees of freedom .",
    "the excitation structures and the size of the activation gaps in the thermodynamic limit have not yet been clarified systematically.@xcite    in this paper we extend the quantum hall ferromagnetism to the fractional filling case of graphene and show analogous properties of pseudospin ferromagnetism and topological excitations in the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) states in graphene .",
    "we start with the projected coulomb interaction hamiltonian onto a certain ll , and study charge and valley excitations , where we treat the valley degrees of freedom @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the language of the pseudospin , while real spin degrees of freedom are supposed to be frozen by the zeeman splitting .",
    "we calculate the exact wave functions of qhf ground states and low - energy excited states basing on the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , and confirm the existence of the skyrmion excitations of valley degrees of freedom not only at integer filling @xmath26 but also at fractional filling @xmath27 for the ll index @xmath6 , 1 and 2 .",

    "the existence of the finite gaps at @xmath17 in the @xmath16 lls strongly supports the qhf but not the mass generation scenarios .",
