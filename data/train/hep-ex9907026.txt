    "there are several reasons @xcite , which make the experimental study of the @xmath3 reaction interesting .",
    "first of all , it is expected that the radial excitations of @xmath4-meson should reveal themselves in this process , thus giving us a possibility to study their properties .",
    "the @xmath3 transition is also important for the precise determination of the total cross section of @xmath5 annihilation into hadrons . in the vector meson dominance model",
    "@xmath3 transition is connected to the @xmath6 vertex , which appears also in a number of hadron decays , like @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the precise experimental data about these processes stimulate theoretical study of the underlying hadron dynamics . in the low energy limit ,",
    "the chiral perturbation theory @xcite and effective chiral lagrangians @xcite give a phenomenological description of meson physics , as it is commonly believed nowadays .",
    "but their applicability is in question for energies above 1 gev . on the other hand , for energies @xmath12 gev , the perturbative qcd is also not applicable .",
    "so any precise experimental information in this energy range can be considered as `` data in searching of the theory '' .",
    "simple but successful vector meson dominance picture may become insufficient when the precision of the data increases .",
    "the @xmath3 transition can be studied in either @xmath13 or @xmath14 channels .",
    "the former can provide about one order of magnitude more statistics , but the latter is more preferable concerning background conditions .",
    "the @xmath14 reaction was studied earlier in the energy range @xmath15 gev by the nd detector @xcite .",
    "indirectly , the @xmath16 cross section was extracted also from the argus data on @xmath17 decay @xcite , under assumption of the conserved vector current ( cvc ) .",
    "the results are in good agreement , thus confirming the cvc hypothesis @xcite .    in 1995 a new set of experiments began with the snd detector @xcite on the novosibirsk vepp-2 m storage ring @xcite .",
    "the maximum luminosity of vepp-2 m at @xmath18 equals @xmath19 .",
    "below we report the results on @xmath14 process , based on 1996 - 1997 two - year snd statistics . in 1996",
    "several scans were made of the energy interval @xmath20 @xcite . from the 1997 experiment @xcite",
    "a part of statistics , collected at the center of mass energies 980 , 1040 and 1060 mev , was used .",
    "as we have already mentioned in the introduction , currently no definite predictions can be made from the basic first - principle theory of strong interactions ( qcd ) in this energy range .",
    "the limited accuracy of the existing experimental data leaves enough room for various phenomenologically inspired models .",
    "now a light is seen at the end of the tunnel : several meson factories come into operation , and also a new generation of fixed - target experiments will accumulate a huge number of events with strongly interacting particles .",
    "so the experimental information is expected to become increasingly precise .",
    "of course a common wisdom says that `` if we see a light at the end of the tunnel , it s the light of an oncoming train '' @xcite .",
    "so it is not excluded that the present theoretical models will be shattered by this `` train '' , but it can deliver a new passenger also .",
    "here we consider a simple phenomenological model , based on the vector meson dominance scheme . our aim is twofold : to estimate the expected cross section and to establish a framework for monte - carlo simulation .",
    "let @xmath21 be the matrix element of the electromagnetic current between the vacuum and the @xmath22 final state .",
    "then the amplitude for the @xmath23 transition via one - photon annihilation diagram    feynman    ( 20000,15000 ) ( 550,13000)[8000 ] ( , ) by -2000 ( , ) @xmath24 ( , ) [ 8000 ] ( , ) by -2000 ( , ) @xmath25 ( , ) [ 6 ] ( , ) ( , ) [ 9 ] by 650 ( , ) @xmath26 ( , ) [ 4 ] by 650 ( , ) @xmath27 ( , ) [ 3 ] by 650 ( , ) @xmath28    reads ( up to irrelevant phase factor ) @xmath29 the standard considerations lead to the following cross section with unpolarized beams @xcite @xmath30 where only transverse ( with respect to the beam direction ) components of @xmath31 contribute and the invariant phase space element is @xmath32 @xmath21 should satisfy the current conservation condition @xmath33 . on the other hand @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the photon polarization 4-vector .",
    "so @xmath36 is a gauge invariant tensor : @xmath37 there exists a general procedure how to construct such gauge invariant tensors which are free from kinematical singularities @xcite . in our case",
    "there are just three independent tensors @xcite @xmath38 + q_\\nu [ ( k\\cdot q)q_\\mu - q^2k_\\mu ] .",

    "@xmath40 are determined by the concrete dynamical model .",
    "summing over the final state photon polarizations ( reduce program @xcite proves to be useful for these calculations ) and performing the angular integration , we get @xcite @xmath41 where ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43 .",

    "@xmath62 can be determined from the @xmath63 decay width .",
    "namely @xmath64 using @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 as inputs , we get @xmath68 as for the photon ",
    "vector meson coupling constant , it can be determined from the @xmath69 width @xmath70 and we get @xmath71    more complex is the situation with @xmath72 coupling constant . assuming vector meson dominance",
    ", @xmath6 vertex appears in a number of processes .",
    "for example , @xmath63 decay proceeds via    ( 30000,15000 ) ( 1000,7500)[300 ] ( , ) [ 6000 ] ( 1000,7500)[300 ] ( , ) [ 6000 ] by 1000 ( , ) @xmath73 ( , ) [ 600 ] ( , ) ( , ) [ 5 ] by 1000 ( , ) @xmath74 by 1000 ( , ) [ 300 ] ( , ) [ 4000 ] ( , ) [ 600 ] ( , ) ( , ) [ 4000 ] by -2000 by 700 ( , ) @xmath49 by 400 ( , ) [ 7 ] by 1000 ( , ) @xmath75    and therefore @xmath76 .",
    "so @xmath77 can be determined from @xmath78 and @xmath79 . on the other hand , @xmath11 decay , in the framework of the vector meson dominance ,",
    "goes through    ( 30000,16000 ) ( 10000,8000)[5 ] ( , ) by 1000 by -1000 ( , ) @xmath74 ( , ) [ 300 ] ( , ) [ 4000 ] ( , ) [ 600 ] ( , ) ( , ) [ 4000 ] by -1500 by 700 ( , ) @xmath4 ( , ) [ 7 ] by 1000 ( , ) @xmath80 ( 10000,8000)[300 ] ( , ) [ 4000 ] ( , ) [ 600 ] ( , ) ( , ) [ 4000 ] by -1500 by -700 ( , ) @xmath81 ( , ) [ 7 ] by 1000 ( , ) @xmath82 by 4000 ( , 8000)@xmath83    and therefore @xmath84 so @xmath72 can be extracted from @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "all these methods for @xmath72 determination give consistent values : @xmath88 but if the value of @xmath72 is extracted from the experimental @xmath89 decay width , assuming that this decay proceeds through @xmath90 intermediate state and that the @xmath91 coupling constant is determined from the @xmath92 , one obtains @xmath93 this is closer to the chiral model prediction @xcite @xmath94    @xmath72 can be estimated also from qcd sum rules @xcite with the result @xmath95 @xcite .    in monte - carlo simulation ,",
    "we have used ( [ gwrp ] ) and @xmath96 , which follows from @xmath97 .",
    "these values assume only @xmath4-pole decay mechanism for @xmath98 transition , without a possible @xmath98 contact term @xcite .",
    "in fact , the uncertainty in these coupling constants does not effect significantly the monte - carlo estimates for the detection efficiencies .",
    "@xmath99 vertex is forbidden by @xmath100-parity , which is negative for all three particles . another way to see",
    "this is to notice that it is impossible to construct isospin invariant trilinear coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath81 isosinglets and isovector pion .",
    "but the isospin symmetry breaks due to electromagnetic effects and mass difference between u and d quarks . as a result ,",
    "pure isospin eigenstates @xmath101 and @xmath102 mix and cease to be mass eigenstates .",
    "instead we will have a nondiagonal mass matrix @xmath103 mass eigenstates ( physical @xmath4 and @xmath81 mesons ) are mixtures of isospin eigenstates , which for small @xmath4@xmath81 mixing angle @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) look like @xmath106 the mixing angle @xmath104 is determined from the condition @xmath107 which gives in the first order in @xmath108 and @xmath104 @xcite : @xmath109 here @xcite @xmath110 is the resonance complex mass square .",
    "so @xmath111 as for @xmath4@xmath81 mixing amplitude @xmath108 , we will take the value @xmath112 which follows from the pion form factor studies @xcite .",
    "since @xmath113 , the presence of the @xmath114 vertex will induce an effective @xmath99 vertex with a coupling constant @xmath115    the described above picture of @xmath4@xmath81 mixing can be trivially generalized to include mixings with the @xmath1 meson also @xcite : @xmath116 due to @xmath1@xmath4 mixing another contribution to the @xmath99 transition will arise @xmath117 because @xmath118 , this latter contribution turns out to be of the same order as @xmath119 .",
    "so for the @xmath120 coupling constant we will use @xmath121    the corresponding contribution in @xmath23 is then determined by equation ( 7 ) .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath4 mixing parameter @xmath122 can be extracted from the @xmath123 experimental data near the @xmath1-meson @xcite : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is experimentally measured interference magnitude @xcite .",
    "taking average values @xmath126 from @xcite , we obtain @xmath127      no definite theoretical predictions exist for @xmath129 meson contribution , nor it is definitely known whether the only one radial excitation gives significant contribution in this energy region .",
    "we will use the following parameterization for this part of the @xmath130 function @xmath131 where @xmath132 corresponds to the @xmath4-meson contribution . @xmath133 and",

    "the main part of the snd detector ( fig.[snd ] ) is a 3-layer , spherical , highly granulated , nai(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite .",
    "tracking system , located in the detector center , consists of two coaxial cylindrical drift chambers . in the radial gap between them",
    "a 5  mm thick plastic scintillation counter with a wavelength shifter fiber readout is placed . from outside the calorimeter",
    "is covered by a thick ( 12  cm ) iron absorber , which attenuates remnants of electromagnetic showers .",
    "an outer muon / veto system is located outside the absorber .",
    "it consists of sheets of plastic scintillator and streamer tubes .",
    "the detailed description of the snd detector can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we repeat only the main points , relevant to this study .",
    "each layer of the calorimeter includes 520560 crystals of eight different shapes .",
    "most of the crystals have shapes of truncated tetrahedral pyramids .",
    "the total solid angle covered by the calorimeter is equal to 0.9 of 4@xmath150 .",
    "the remaining space is occupied by magnetic structure elements of the storage ring , mainly by quadrupole lenses .",
    "pairs of counters of the first two layers with thickness of 3@xmath151 and 5@xmath151 respectively are sealed together in common containers made of thin ( 0.1 mm ) aluminum foil . in order to improve light collection efficiency and to separate one crystal from another ,",

    "value of the nonuniformity of the light collection efficiency along the crystals is less than 3  % .",
    "all the containers are fastened to 5 mm aluminum supporting hemispheres .",
    "the outer layer of 6@xmath151 thick counters has a similar design .",
    "thus the total thickness of the calorimeter is 13.5@xmath151 ( 35 cm ) of nai(tl ) .    as photosensitive devices for the calorimeter counters vacuum phototriodes",
    "are used @xcite .",
    "the quantum efficiency of their photocathodes is about 15  % , average gain is 10 , and light collection efficiency for individual counters is about 10  % .",
    "signals from phototriodes are amplified by charge sensitive preamplifiers located directly on the counters .",
    "output signals are carried to shaping amplifiers via 20 m long twisted cables .",
    "for the trigger needs the calorimeter crystals are logically organized into `` towers '' .",
    "a tower consists of counters located within the same @xmath152 interval in polar and azimuthal directions in all three layers .",
    "the number of counters in a tower is 12 at large angles and 6 in the regions close to the beam .",
    "in addition to signals from individual counters each tower produces an analog total energy deposition signal and two trigger signals . in order to equalize contributions from different counters into the total energy deposition signal and to obtain equal energy thresholds for trigger signals over the whole calorimeter ,",
    "all shaping amplifiers are equipped with computer controlled attenuators , allowing to adjust channels gain in steps of 1/255 .",
    "the resulting electronics noise is close to 0.3  mev ( r.m.s . ) .",
    "the dependence of the calorimeter energy resolution on photon energies was fitted as @xcite @xmath153{e(\\mathrm{gev } ) } } \\ ; . \\nonumber\\ ] ]    the calorimeter energy resolution is determined mostly by the amount of passive material inside the calorimeter .",
    "noticeable contribution comes also from the shower energy leakage due to limited thickness of nai(tl ) and gaps between crystals .",
    "it turned out that the nonuniformity of the light collection efficiency in the nai(tl ) crystals of the inner calorimeter layer contributes significantly into energy resolution .",
    "the simulation of calorimeter response agrees reasonably well with experiment after these effects are included into simulation program .",
    "absolute energy calibration of the calorimeter is performed by using cosmic muons @xcite and bhabha scattering @xcite .",
    "the latter process , together with the two - photon annihilation reaction , was also used for the luminosity measurements . the systematic error in the integrated luminosity determination",
    "is about 3% .",
    "after the calorimeter calibration with @xmath154 events , the photon energies turned out to be biased by about @xmath155 . in order to compensate for this bias , the calibration coefficients for photons were corrected accordingly .",
    "the tracking system consists of two cylindrical drift chambers .",

    "both chambers are divided into 20 jet - type cells in azimuthal plane .",
    "each cell contains 5 sense wires .",
    "the longitudinal coordinate is measured by the charge division method with an accuracy of 3  mm .",
    "in addition , a cathode strip readout for inner and outer layers provides the improvement of the latter value to 0.5  mm .",

    "the three - level trigger of the detector selects events of different types : events with photons only , events with charged particles , and cosmic muon events for the detector calibration .",
    "the drift chamber first level trigger ( flt ) searches for tracks in the drift chambers with impact parameter @xmath158  mm .",
    "the calorimeter flt uses the total energy deposition in the calorimeter and double coincidences of calorimeter towers with a threshold of 30  mev .",
    "detector electronics provides also signals for a second level trigger .",
    "but at present the second level trigger proved to be unnecessary and was not implemented , although a slot is left for it in the electronics .",
    "the third level trigger ( tlt ) is implemented as a special fast computer code on a main data acquisition computer .",
    "it checks events before recording them on tape , rejects cosmic events with charged trigger , and suppresses beam - related background using @xmath159-coordinates of tracks , measured by drift chambers .",

    "while studying the channel @xmath164 one should be aware about the possible background from the following processes @xmath165 @xmath166 a primary selection of the @xmath14 candidates was done according to following criteria :    * the event must contain exactly 5 photons in the calorimeter and have no charged particles , * the azimuthal angle of any final photon lies within the interval @xmath167 , * the total ( normalized over @xmath161 ) energy deposition of final photons is in the range @xmath168 , * the normalized full momentum of the event ( @xmath169 ) is less than 0.15 .",

    "we clearly see that our 5-photon events are predominantly @xmath177 events also .",

    "a @xmath178 of this fit ( @xmath179 ) can be used for the background rejection .",
    "background from ( [ phietg ] ) simulates @xmath180 events mainly due to loss of photons through the openings in the calorimeter around detector poles and/or merging of close photon pairs .",
    "when photons merge in the calorimeter , the corresponding electromagnetic shower is , as a rule , broader in transverse direction than the electromagnetic showers from the single photons .",
    "this circumstance can be used to discriminate against merged photons and so against a great deal of background ( [ phietg ] ) .",
    "the corresponding parameter ( @xmath181 ) is described in @xcite .",
    "a 2-dimensional distributions of our events in the @xmath182 plane , as well as monte - carlo simulated ( [ eewpi ] ) signal events and ( [ phietg ] ) background events ( fig.[fig4 ] ) , indicate that our signal events are almost completely bound in the @xmath183 area .",
    "this was confirmed by experimental events outside of the @xmath1-meson , where there should be no background from the process ( [ phietg ] ) .    on the basis of these considerations",

    "one more source of background is a recently observed process @xcite : @xmath185 the recoil mass of the photon from this process is peaked at the @xmath186-meson mass and this peculiarity can be used to separate a great deal of such events from the events of process ( [ eewpi ] ) .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath187 condition as one more cut to select events from the process ( [ eewpi ] ) , where @xmath188 stands for the photon recoil mass .    after applying these cuts , the @xmath81-meson peak is clearly seen in the invariant mass of @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( for each @xmath180 event , from two possible ( @xmath189 ) combinations , the one is taken , which has @xmath190 closest to @xmath191 ) , as it is illustrated by fig.[fig5 ] ( cut i ) . finally , to extract channel ( [ eewpi ] )",
    ", the @xmath192 condition was added to the above mentioned cuts .",
    "the @xmath190 histograms were fitted by a function @xmath193 the fit indicates a good agreement between the experiment and simulation . for the 2356  mc events , which passed cut i , the fitted value of the constant term is @xmath194 .",
    "since in the @xmath192 interval we have 35 histogram bins , such background constant corresponds to @xmath195 combinatorial background events , that is about @xmath196 .",
    "the same conclusion follows also for cut ii .    for the 560 experimental events which passed cut i , the following background constant was obtained : @xmath197 , which correspond to @xmath198 background events . subtracting the expected combinatorial background of @xmath199",
    ", we can estimate the residual background from ( [ phietg ] ) , ( [ phikk ] ) , ( [ phif0 g ] ) , as @xmath200 events ( @xmath201 ) . for cut ii",
    "this background was found to be twice higher , that is @xmath202 background events from the selected 864 experimental events ( @xmath203 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "monte carlo studies indicate the following probabilities for events from the main background sources to pass cut i : @xmath204 for process ( [ phietg ] ) , and @xmath205 for process ( [ phif0 g ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath206 background events from process ( [ phietg ] ) and @xmath207 from process ( [ phif0 g ] ) .",
    "so the total number of background events from these sources is estimated to be @xmath208 . for cut ii",
    "we expect @xmath209 and @xmath210 background events , respectively , or in total @xmath211 events .",
    "these numbers are in a good agreement with those obtained from the above mentioned fitting of the @xmath81-meson peak .    to check the accuracy of monte carlo simulation the following procedure was applied .",
    "for the above described cut i and cut ii , one of the parameters is released and the resulting experimental distribution @xmath212 for this parameter is compared with the sum of mc predictions for the signal @xmath213 and expected backgrounds from ( [ phietg ] ) and ( [ phif0 g ] ) sources : @xmath214 .",
    "the normalization coefficients @xmath215 and @xmath216 are determined by the total statistics of generated mc samples for this reactions .",
    "the normalization coefficient for the signal @xmath217 is then determined from the condition that @xmath212 and @xmath218 histograms have the equal total numbers of events .",
    "note that any variation in the @xmath219 coefficient indicates some systematics and/or other background sources , not accounted for in the comparison . for cut i the averaged deviation turned out to be 3% and for cut ii",
    "the distributions for all parameters used in event selections show good agreement between @xmath220 and experiment .",
    "this indirectly indicates that the possible background from process ( [ phikk ] ) is rather small and does not exceed @xmath221 . as an example , on fig.[fig6 ] we present @xmath190 distributions .",
    "we assume the following parameterization for the visible ( detection ) cross section @xmath222 : @xmath223\\sigma(s)+kb\\sigma_b(s ) \\ ; , \\label{csvis } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath224 is the detection efficiency for the process ( [ eewpi ] ) , @xmath225 accounts for the radiative corrections , which are calculated according to the standard procedure @xcite , @xmath226 is a background cross section , which was assumed to coincide with @xmath227 , @xmath26 is the background suppression factor , @xmath228 is described below . finally , @xmath229 is a cross section of the process under investigation .",
    "because we are interested in @xmath229 in a narrow energy interval , we have taken @xmath230|r|^2 , \\ ; \\ ; r=1-z\\frac{m_\\phi \\gamma_\\phi}{s - m_\\phi^2+im_\\phi\\gamma_\\phi}. \\label{sgfit } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the detection efficiency @xmath224 was calculated using monte - carlo simulation in conditions of individual scans for various energies .",
    "detection efficiencies do not show any significant energy dependence .",
    "so we have taken an efficiency value averaged over scans and energies , @xmath231 ( only statistical error is indicated ) as a fair estimate for cut ii .    for a tighter cut",
    "i some systematic errors could be expected . to estimate this systematics , we compared the numbers of rejected events for each parameter of cut i in the above described @xmath212 and @xmath218 distributions .",
    "the following correction factors ( @xmath232 ) were obtained : @xmath233 for @xmath169 , @xmath234 for @xmath179 , @xmath235 for @xmath181 , @xmath234 for @xmath188 and @xmath236 for @xmath190 . in total , the monte carlo simulation overestimates the detection efficiency @xmath237 times , if we assume that there are no correlations between the used selection parameters . with this correction factor taken into account ,",
    "an average detection efficiency @xmath238 was obtained for cut i.    the background suppression factor @xmath26 was also assumed to be energy independent .",
    "it was calculated using @xmath239 simulated events from the process ( [ phietg ] ) and equals @xmath240 for cut i and @xmath241 for cut ii .    as we have seen above , for cut",
    "i a relatively large fraction of background is expected from process ( [ phif0 g ] ) .",
    "some small amount of @xmath242 decay related background ( [ phikk ] ) is also not excluded . to take into account these and other @xmath1-meson related backgrounds , the factor @xmath228 is introduced in ( [ csvis ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that the different energy dependencies of various background cross - sections is not relevant at the present level of statistical accuracy and so they all can be approximated by the @xmath243 behavior .",
