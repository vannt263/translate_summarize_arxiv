    "however , if @xmath3 , @xmath4 are two transverse knots that are smoothly isotopic and share the same self - linking number , @xmath3 and @xmath4 do not have to be transversally isotopic : this phenomenon was first discovered in @xcite and @xcite , and more examples were recently obtained in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study contact manifolds that arise as cyclic covers branched over transverse knots and links in @xmath0 .",
    "( such cyclic covers carry natural contact structures lifting @xmath5 . )",
    "the main question we would like to address is    suppose that transverse knots @xmath6 are smoothly isotopic , and @xmath7 .",

    "are @xmath9-fold cyclic covers branched over @xmath3 and @xmath4 contactomorphic ?",
    "[ quest ]    finding two such non - contactomorphic covers would imply that the induced contact structure on the branched cover is an efficient invariant of transverse knots . on the other hand , a positive answer to",
    "the above question for any pair of knots means that the cyclic branched covers are insensitive to the subtler structure of transverse knots .    while we found no examples of non - contactomorphic branched covers , we are able to answer question [ quest ] positively in many special cases .",
    "in particular , we show that branched cyclic covers of any degree are contactomorphic for all examples of birman ",
    "menasco @xcite , and that branched double covers for many examples of @xcite are also contactomorphic .",
    "we prove    the @xmath9-fold cyclic branched covers of transverse links @xmath3 and @xmath4 are contactomorphic for all @xmath9 if :    * @xmath10 and @xmath11 are a positive and a negative transverse push - offs of a legendrian link @xmath12 and its legendrian mirror @xmath13 , or * @xmath3 and @xmath4 are given by transverse 3-braids related by a negative flype .",
    "moreover , the branched double covers are contactomorphic for arbitrary transverse braids related by a negative flype .",
    "[ introthm ]    in fact , we are able to prove a little more ( see section  [ distinguish ] ) .",
    "we also note that all examples of birman  menasco satisfy the second condition of theorem  [ introthm ] .",

    "let @xmath14 denote the natural contact structure on the branched @xmath9-fold cyclic cover @xmath15 of a transverse link @xmath12 as explained in subsection  [ subsec - induced - str ] .",
    "we describe the contact manifolds @xmath15 in two ways .",
    "first , we give an open book decomposition supporting @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath12 is represented as a transverse @xmath16-braid , an open book decomposition of @xmath17 can be obtained as a lift of the open book for @xmath18 whose binding is the braid axis , and the page is a disk meeting @xmath12 transversely at @xmath16 points .",
    "the monodromy for the resulting open book can be read off the braid word .",
    "more precisely , a positive crossing in the braid contributes @xmath19 positive dehn twists to the monodromy , while a negative crossing contributes @xmath19 negative dehn twists .",
    "second , we give contact surgery diagrams @xcite for these contact manifolds .",
    "we find that a positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) crossing in the braid corresponds to a legendrian surgery ( resp .",
    "@xmath20 contact surgery ) on @xmath19 standard legendrian unknots .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the linking between these @xmath19 unknots depends on the sign on the crossing : while for a negative crossing the surgery is performed on _ unlinked _ unknots , for a positive crossing the unknots are linked .",
    "( this phenomenon arises in the smooth setting as well , where the construction can be thought of as a version of the montesinos trick for higher order covers . )",
    "we refer the reader to lemma [ dehn twist lemma ] and theorem [ surgthm ] for precise statements .",
    "this description yields a few properties of @xmath9-fold cyclic branched covers ; we can determine whether they are tight or overtwisted in certain cases and describe the homotopy invariants of the contact structures .",
    "[ tight - ow ]    the contact manifold @xmath21 is stein fillable if the transverse link @xmath12 is represented by a quasipositive braid ; it is overtwisted if @xmath12 is obtained as a transverse stabilization of another transverse link .",
    "in fact , in section  [ properties ] we prove overtwistedness for a much wider class of contact structures .",
    "[ homotp ] fix @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the @xmath23 structure induced by @xmath24",
    ". then @xmath25 .",
    "the three - dimensional invariant @xmath26 is completely determined by the topological link type of @xmath12 and its self - linking number @xmath27 .    the present paper continues the work started by the third author in @xcite , where question [ quest ] was studied for the case of branched double covers .",
    "( the paper @xcite was written before the advent of heegaard floer transverse invariants @xcite , and the only explicit examples of non - transversely simple knots available then were the 3-braids of @xcite . ) the techniques from @xcite are useful for the higher order covers as well ; in particular , theorems [ homotp ] and [ tight - ow ] are direct extensions of results of @xcite .",
    "in this section , we fix notation and collect the necessary facts about transverse knots , open books and contact surgeries , referring the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "we assume that all 3-manifolds are closed , connected and oriented , and all contact structures are co - oriented",
    ".      it will be helpful to represent transverse links by closed braids .",
    "for this , consider the symmetric version of the standard contact structure @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "then , any closed braid about @xmath30-axis can be made transverse to the contact planes ; moreover , any transverse link is transversely isotopic to a closed braid in @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "equivalently , we can consider transverse braids in the contact structure @xmath1 , for example assuming that our braids are satellites of a fixed standard legendrian unknot with @xmath31 .    to define the self - linking number @xmath27 , trivialize the plane field @xmath32 , and",
    "let the link @xmath33 be the push - off of @xmath12 in the direction of the first coordinate vector for @xmath32 .",
    "then , @xmath27 is the linking number between @xmath12 and @xmath33 .",
    "given a closed braid representation of @xmath12 , we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the number of positive ( negative ) crossings , and @xmath37 is the braid index .",
    "the _ stabilization _ of a transverse link represented as a braid is equivalent to the negative braid stabilization , i.e. adding an extra strand and a negative kink to the braid .",
    "if @xmath38 is the result of stabilization of @xmath12 , then @xmath39 note that the positive braid stabilization does not change the transverse type of the link .",
    "abusing notation , we will often identify a transverse link with its braid word , writing it in terms of the standard generators @xmath40 and their inverses .",
    "another useful way to think about transverse knots is as push - offs of legendrian knots .",
    "indeed , a given legendrian knot yields two transverse knots ( a positive and negative push - off ) , whose self - linking number is @xmath41 .",
    "this description is used in @xcite .",
    "an open book decomposition of a 3-manifold @xmath42 is a pair @xmath43 of a surface @xmath44 with non - empty boundary @xmath45 and a diffeomorphism @xmath46 of @xmath44 with @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 is the mapping torus @xmath49 / \\sim $ ] , where @xmath50 .",

    "stabilization of an open book consists of plumbing a right - handed hopf band , i.e attaching a 1-handle to a page and composing the monodromy with a right - handed dehn twist along an arbitrary curve intersecting the cocore of the handle at one point .",

    "when the surgery coefficient is @xmath62 ( with respect to the contact framing on @xmath60 ) , this procedure is compatible with contact structures : the gluing can be done so that the contact structure on the solid torus matches the contact structure on its complement .",
    "moreover , the resulting contact manifold is independent of choices , so the @xmath62 contact surgery is well - defined .",
    "contact surgery is a very useful tool , as any contact manifold can be obtained from @xmath0 by a contact surgery on some legendrian link .",

    "first , we can consider the @xmath23 structure @xmath64 on @xmath63 induced by @xmath32 .",
    "secondly , when @xmath65 is torsion , the three - dimensional invariant @xmath26 can be defined @xcite .",

    "furthermore , it is shown in @xcite that the same result is true for @xmath20-contact surgeries ( for the @xmath23 structure @xmath73 on @xmath69 described above ) .",
    "there are two ways to describe a given contact structure , via an open book decomposition or a contact surgery diagram .",
    "we will need to switch between the two descriptions . a contact surgery diagram consists of a legendrian link in @xmath18 with surgery coefficients .",

    "we can then embed the page of the open book into @xmath18 ; if the curves on which the remaining dehn twists are to be performed become legendrian knots in @xmath18 , we can replace the dehn twists with @xmath62 contact surgeries to obtain the required surgery diagram .",
