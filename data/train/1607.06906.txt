    "awareness of energy and environmental crises has catalyzed the evolutionary shift towards electrifying personal transportation . in recent years ,",
    "investments on electric vehicles ( evs ) as eco - friendly and cost - efficient substitutes for conventional fuel - propelled automobiles that exhaust natural resources have been over - whelming . classified broadly based on their mode of propulsion , evs are either purely battery electric vehicles ( bevs ) or plug - in hybrid electric vehicles ( phevs ) , having benefits far more broad than conventional vehicles @xcite .",
    "these benefits however , are accompanied by various new challenges as more evs are integrated into the power grid .",
    "prime concerns include power distribution instability and transmission congestion due to the unmanaged charging and/or discharging of evs at grid - connected electric vehicle supply equipments , commonly known as charging stations ( css ) .    from the research prospective , optimal charging and discharging of evs",
    "have been widely scrutinized due to their significant impact on the load regulation of vehicle - to - grid ( v2 g ) systems @xcite .",
    "the bidirectional flow of power between evs and pwer grid facilitates load flattening by shifting the demands of charging evs from peak load hours to off - peak periods @xcite . as reported in @xcite , a considerable level of ev penetration at different time slots",
    "can substantially affect the electricity pricing in the scheduling process .",
    "with regard to power costs at different time intervals and uncertainty in ev arrival times , smart scheduling techniques are required to not only satisfy profit expectations , but also prevent the grid from crashing through power load flattening @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     while many other set - ups and approaches have been applied to envisage vehicle - to - grid interactions in the literature @xcite , scheduling in a large - scale v2 g environment in which evs have the flexibility of getting service at multiple charging stations coordinated by their individual aggregators , referred to as mcs - ma in this paper , has not been explored so far .",
    "therefore , to fill this gap , we investigate the problem of profit maximization under multiple css by proposing an optimization model that incorporates the practically existing constraints on the capacity and associated auxiliary costs of each station . by considering the indeterministic arrival of evs during the scheduling process , we propose an online greedy algorithm that guides incoming evs to the most suitable cs",
    ". table  [ table1 ] summarizes the main characteristics of the proposed work in comparison to other seminal reported works .",
    "we consider a system comprising of @xmath0 css , each indexed as cs@xmath1 where @xmath2 , and a set of incoming evs , denoted by @xmath3 such that @xmath4 , which according to @xcite is categorized into three groups such that @xmath5 . here",

    ", every ev is allocated to some cs@xmath1 , having a maximum capacity of @xmath11 vehicles in each time slot .",
    "the maintenance cost of an ev at cs@xmath1 is taken to be @xmath12 .",
    "correspondingly , we also assume an identical labor / service cost denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "we consider non - preemptive allocation of evs for charging and discharging activities at each station with @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the arrival and departure times of vehicle @xmath16 at cs@xmath1 .",
    "additionally , the maximum power with which each ev can charge and discharge in each time slot is given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , depending on the imposed energy constraints and instant electricity price in that slot .",
    "for a given ev @xmath16 , @xmath19 represents a set of the consecutive time slots in charging / discharging interval at cs@xmath1 , satisfying the following constraint : @xmath20 model parameters regarding battery degradation due to high charging / discharging frequencies ( @xmath21 ) and fluctuations ( @xmath22 ) are also taken into account to include the auxiliary costs associated with ev batteries @xcite .",
    "the binary decision variable @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 , if ev @xmath16 is in cs@xmath1 at time slot @xmath25 and @xmath26 , if otherwise .",
    "also , @xmath27 is used to denote the charging or discharging power of ev @xmath16 in cs@xmath1 during slot @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath28 when @xmath29 is in the charging state and @xmath30 when @xmath31 is discharging . the initial energy level and battery capacity of ev @xmath16",
    "are indicated by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 denotes the final energy stored in the battery of ev @xmath16 on the completion of its designated operation interval such that @xmath35 .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath36 is determined by the ev owner before arriving to a cs and is defined to specify the final fractional energy requirement in terms of the battery capacity .",
    "a summary of all the notations along with their descriptions is given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "outlines the communication flow for ev scheduling in an mcs - ma environment , where evs are allowed to select their cs for service .",
    "each cs is coordinated by an individual aggregator which facilitates the bidirectional information and energy flow between evs and the power grid . given the total number of evs in the system ,",
    "their respective arrival epochs at the cs varies randomly over discrete time .",
    "prior to cs selection , each ev sends scheduling - related data to the aggregators of all css .",
    "such data includes information regarding arrival to / departure from each station , initial energy , battery capacity , and energy level desired by the vehicle .",
    "data transmission between evs and the aggregators is feasible via cellular or satellite wireless communication depending on the underlying infrastructure of the network @xcite .",
    "each aggregator then forwards the received data to its local scheduler at the cs in order to compute the achievable profit at that station .",
    "the computed profit at each local cs is then piggy - backed on the reply message sent back to the ev by the aggregators .",
    "on receiving information about the local profits from all css , the ev eventually selects the most profitable station and informs its arrival to that particular station through a reservation message .",
    "once plugged - in to the selected cs , the ev starts interacting with the grid for energy exchange throughout its designated service interval .",
    "depending on the vehicle type and energy demand , the charging and discharging in each time slot is determined by solving a local optimizer .          in the context of smart scheduling ,",
    "the charging and discharging powers of evs is modulated by the electricity price at that time instant .",
    "the tou pricing model is widely used in scenarios where only one ev is considered @xcite . since the tou pricing model does not reflect the impact of multiple evs on the price , the real - time pricing ( rtp ) model has been appreciated in which the time - dependent price is driven by the total electricity load at that instant @xcite . as an alternative model ,",
    "the combination of inclining block rates ( ibr ) and rtp has also been proposed , in which the price remains unchanged up to a threshold point determined by the energy utility company , beyond which it increases as either a linear or non - linear function @xcite of the current load .",
    "for sake of simplicity , we however adopt the rtp model where the instantaneous price , @xmath37 , is a linear function of the load in that time slot , i.e. @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are non - negative real numbers symbolizing the intercept and slope , respectively , and @xmath41 is the load at cs@xmath1 at time @xmath25 . denoting the base load generated at cs@xmath1 by demands excluding evs as @xmath42 ,",
    "the instant load @xmath41 is given as : @xmath43 for the electricity price to be expressed in terms of @xmath44 , the units of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 in the price model should be @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively . since the base load and ev charging / discharging powers do not alter during each times slot , the electricity price remains constant throughout the time slot .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that although we consider the linear pricing model as a generalization , the theoretical and simulation results presented in this work can be extended to other pricing models mentioned above .      under the rtp model , the overall profit gain of an ev owner",
    "@xmath47 is equal to the overall revenue due to charging / discharging operations @xmath48 minus the maintenance and battery degradation / fluctuation costs @xmath49 in each slot of its allocated time interval .",
    "@xmath50 can be calculated as follows : @xmath51 the auxiliary cost is given as the following summation : @xmath52 therefore , the profit that the ev owner can obtain in time slot @xmath25 at cs@xmath1 is : @xmath53 it is easy to see that ev owners gain positive revenue when the energy flow from vehicles to the grid is more than the flow in the opposite direction . on the other side ,",
    "the profit made by css due to the energy demand of evs @xmath54 is the same as in ( [ eq6 ] ) , where @xmath55 is the negation of ( [ eq4 ] ) , with the auxiliary cost @xmath56 given as below : @xmath57    since the ultimate aim of the energy utility provider is to maximize the overall joint profit of both , ev owners and css , we consider a weighting control parameter @xmath58 , such that ev owners receive maximum profit when @xmath59 and the css obtain highest profit when @xmath60 .",
    "hence , the total obtainable profit for both dealing sides in @xmath61 time slots is : @xmath62",
    "in this section , we define the problem of offline ev scheduling for charging and discharging in an mcs - ma set - up , where all information regarding the evs in the system are available a priori .",
    "the aim is to assign evs to css such that overall profit proportion of both , ev owners and css , is maximized .",
