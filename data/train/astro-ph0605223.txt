    "stars with initial masses between 0.8 and 8 m@xmath2 pass through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of evolution , and undergo significant mass loss @xcite . evolving from the tip of the agb to the planetary nebula stage , stars move through the post - agb phase ( typically 10@xmath3 ",
    "10@xmath4 years ) , during which the circumstellar dust shell moves away from the star and decreases in temperature , from @xmath5 400 to 100 k @xcite .",
    "the properties of post - agb stars have been reviewed by , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this evolutionary phase is important as it provides an insight into nucleosynthesis and mixing processes during the later stages of stellar evolution .",
    "most post - agb stars have been identified from their infrared excess ( e.g. , from _ iras _ observations ) , originating from the circumstellar dust shell .",
    "this shell is more readily detected during the initial stages of post - agb evolution , when it is relatively hot and close to the star , and hence the majority of stars identified as being at a post - agb evolutionary stage have just left the agb and are of spectral type a , f or g @xcite .",
    "however , there are many features of post - agb evolution which are not yet fully understood . for example , several stars exhibit abundance patterns similar to interstellar gas , with elements such as mg , si , al , ca , ti etc following the very low fe abundance , while c , n , o and s are near solar ( @xcite ; see , for example , ) .",
    "@xcite discussed the conditions necessary for such a ` cleaned - up ' photosphere in post - agb stars , suggesting that the process is likely to occur during mass transfer between members of a binary system , or accretion triggered by a binary companion .",
    "@xcite added that accretion of material from a circumstellar disc around a binary system was a favorable scenario . in this , grains form in the circumstellar shell produced during the agb phase , and the subsequent slow accretion of gas from the material results in the observed abundance patterns .",
    "@xcite found that all the extremely iron deficient post - agb stars , known at that time , were binaries , supporting this hypothesis .",
    "although the majority of post - agb candidates are cool objects , several b - type stars originally classified as population i stars are now believed to be at this evolutionary stage , on the basis of their derived atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "these b - type stars should be evolving from the cooler post - agb stars , but significant differences are displayed .",
    "the most obvious is the large carbon underabundance found for several hot objects , which may imply that they have left the agb prior to the onset of the third dredge - up ( for example , ) .",
    "the abundance differences between hot and cool post - agb candidates indicate that further study is required to fully understand this evolutionary stage .",
    "it is important to begin by studying hot post - agb objects of known initial metallicity , rather than field stars of unknown origin .",
    "such a sample are the ultraviolet ( uv)-bright stars found in several globular clusters , whose post - agb nature has been established from their position in the cluster colour  magnitude diagram @xcite .",
    "the term ` uv - bright ' was first suggested by @xcite and denotes stars which have ultraviolet fluxes larger than those in either the red giants or the horizontal branch stars @xcite . for an excellent review of hot stars in globular clusters",
    "see @xcite .",
    "roa5701 , in the galactic globular cluster @xmath0 centauri , is a well studied uv - bright star due to its relative brightness ( ) .",
    "the metal - poor @xmath0 cen is known to have ( at least ) three stellar populations , with metallicities : [ fe / h ] @xmath5 1.6 , corresponding to the metal poor population containing the bulk of the stars , [ fe / h ] @xmath5 1.2 for an intermediate metallicity population and [ fe / h ] @xmath5 0.5 for a metal - rich population comprising 5 per cent of the stars ( ) . in this paper , we analyse high - resolution optical spectra of roa5701 using non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) model atmosphere techniques to estimate its atmospheric parameters and chemical composition , leading to a reconsideration of its evolutionary status .",
    "the spectroscopic data presented here were obtained with the 3.9-m anglo  australian telescope ( aat ) on the nights of 2000 july 15 and 16 .",
    "the university college london chelle spectrograph ( ucls ) was used with the mitll 2a ccd ( 2048 @xmath6 4096 ) detector , the 31 groove @xmath7 grating and the 70 cm camera , giving a linear dispersion of 2 @xmath7 and a spectral resolution [ full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) ] of _ r _ @xmath5 40000 .",
    "the read - out noise and gain were 1.8 @xmath8 and 0.37 @xmath9 respectively .",
    "two overlapping wavelength regions were observed , resulting in a spectral coverage of 37609400  .",
    "flat - field and bias frames were exposed at the beginning and end of the nights , while thorium - argon wavelength calibration spectra were interweaved with the stellar spectra .",
    "reduction of the raw two dimensional ccd images were performed using standard procedures within the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ; @xcite ) .",
    "procedures such as bias subtraction and flat fielding were achieved using the ccdred package @xcite .",
    "cosmic - ray removal , sky subtraction , stellar extraction and wavelength calibration were performed using specred @xcite and doecslit @xcite .",
    "after extraction , the spectra were co - added ( resulting in a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath5 30 ) and inserted into the starlink package dipso @xcite for further analysis .",
    "the spectral continuum was normalised , with low - order ( @xmath10 5 ) polynomials in regions of spectra free from absorption lines . following this , they were radial velocity shifted to the restframe , using unblended metal and hydrogen lines .",
    "this resulted in the kinematical local standard of rest radial velocity @xmath11 = + 246 @xmath12 3 @xmath13 , using corrections generated by the starlink progam rv @xcite .",
    "equivalent widths were measured for metal absorption lines by utilising the emission line fitting ( elf ) routines within dipso .",
    "elf uses non - linear least squares gaussian fitting , with line  centre , linewidth and line  strength as variable parameters .",
    "the typical fwhm for the metal absorption line spectrum was @xmath5 11 @xmath13 , indicating that a small amount of broadening is evident in the lines .",
    "the error associated with the measurement of equivalent widths has been previously discussed @xcite , with a well - observed unblended feature having an accuracy of typically 10 per cent ( designated as quality a in table [ tab_all ] ) , a weak or blended feature accurate to 20 per cent ( designated b ) , and weaker features with accuracy less than 20 per cent ( designated c ) . for the balmer hydrogen lines ( i.e. , h@xmath14 , h@xmath15 , h@xmath16 , h@xmath17 ) and diffuse hei lines , equivalent widths were not measured , but theoretical profiles were fitted to the normalized observational data ( see , for example , fig . [ fig_h ] ) .     at 4861  in the spectrum of roa5701 .",
    "the theoretical profiles have been generated for surface gravities of 3.0 , 3.25 and 3.5 dex ( lower , middle and upper smooth curves , respectively ) , and imply a surface gravity of log  _ g _ = 3.2 dex.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    .equivalent width measurements and corresponding abundances for the observed metal lines . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     studies of post - agb stars have shown that some of these objects exhibit abundance trends similar to that of interstellar gas , i.e. , with cno and s near solar and mg , si , ca , etc following the low abundances of fe @xcite .",
    "examples of such objects include hd46703 @xcite and hd56126 @xcite .",
    "grain formation in the circumstellar shells of stars during the agb evolution has been suggested to explain the origin of such a ` cleaned - up ' photosphere .",
    "the premise is that during the agb phase , in the cool atmosphere of the star , a circumstellar shell is formed in which dust condenses .",
    "dust particles are removed by radiation pressure , while the ` cleaned ' gas is re - accreted onto the stellar surface .",
    "iron , and similar metals , have a high condensation temperature , so are more likely to condense onto dust grains .",
    "elements such as c , n and o , with lower condensation temperatures , show no significant depletions and stay in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "hence , the remaining re - accreted gas forms an iron - poor atmosphere .",
    "@xcite suggest that roa5701 has undergone this gas  dust separation as they found a very low fe abundance , with n and o relatively undepleted .",
    "however , in this scenario one would expect fe to have a similar depletion to mg and si , as these would also be subject to grain formation @xcite . from our work",
    "we find that mg and si are underabundant by [ mg / h ] = 1.1 @xmath12 0.2 dex and [ si / h]= 1.3 @xmath12 0.3 dex ( relative to the ism ; table [ tab_ay ] ) .",
    "however @xcite derive a fe abundance of [ fe / h ] = 2.6 dex ( relative to the ism ) from _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) spectra , which is more than 1.0 dex lower than the mg and si values we find .",
    "also , we have derived an abundance for s of [ s / h ] = 1.4 @xmath12 0.2 dex ( relative to the ism ) , so the mg , si and s values agree with each other and are consistent with the average metallicity of the cluster , namely [ fe / h ] = 1.2 dex @xcite .",
    "this result would remain unchanged if we had adopted abundance estimates relative to those from young b - type stars . if grain formation has occured , one would expect s to be relatively undepleted and therefore not have an adundance pattern in agreement with those of mg and si , thus implying that , for roa5701 , there is no evidence of a ` cleaned - up ' photosphere .",
    "there are two possibilities to explain the abundance patterns seen .",
    "either the iron abundance suggested by @xcite is incorrect , or it is indeed very low and an alternative mechanism is needed to explain the abundance results found .",
    "one explanation for the low fe abundance is s - processing , with fe reduced via successive neutron capture of @xmath18fe .",
    "this scenario has been applied to h - deficient very hot post - agb stars , e.g. , pg1159 type star k1 - 16 .",
    "however s - process enriched objects are known to cover a range of metallicities between [ fe / h ] = 0.2 to 1.0 dex @xcite , much greater than the value @xcite find for roa5701 , i.e. , [ fe / h ] = 2.7 dex .",
    "also , this mechanism is normally observed in post - agb stars which have c - rich circumstellar material , such as hd158616 @xcite . by contrast , we have found c to be deficient by [ c / h ] @xmath10 1.4 dex and so s - processing seems unlikely .",
    "the low c abundance could be explained by hot bottom burning ( hbb ; @xcite ) , as suggested for v453oph @xcite . in this , temperatures become large enough for cno processing to begin at the base of the convective envelope , with @xmath19c converted to @xmath20n and moved to the surface .",
    "@xcite suggests that hbb may have an important role at extremely low metallicities .",
    "only population i stars of initial mass m @xmath21 5 m@xmath2 , and population ii stars of m @xmath21 3.5 m@xmath2 , experience hbb @xcite , and as the initial mass of roa5701 is unknown , no conclusions can be made regarding this process .",
    "the fe abundance pattern observed in roa5701 does not appear to be plausible in terms of s - processing .",
    "for the abundance patterns of the other elements , @xcite note that it is not necessary to invoke dredge - up during the agb phase to explain these , but a moderate third dredge - up can not be ruled out . the processes of dredge - up are well known ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , dredge - up occurs during the stars evolution as the products of hydrogen and helium burning are transported from the core to the surface , changing the surface abundances .",
    "at the first dredge - up , the surface @xmath20n abundance is increased at the expense of @xmath19c , while the @xmath22o abundance sees little change . during the second dredge - up",
    ", hydrogen products are again moved to the surface , with @xmath19c and @xmath22o almost completely converted to @xmath20n .",
    "the third dredge - up sees the products of the helium burning cycle , following the triple@xmath14 process , brought to the surface . as a result , @xmath19c is enhanced relative to @xmath20n and @xmath22o , @xmath20n being formed during the hydrogen burning and @xmath22o formed through @xmath14capture by carbon atoms .",
    "also s - process elements are dredged - up to the surface , and so would provide evidence for the third dredge - up @xcite .",
    "objects which have undergone the third dredge - up would , therefore , have c - rich material , for example k648 in the globular cluster m15 @xcite .",
    "hotter post - agb objects display a deficiency in c , unlike cool post - agb stars , which suggests that they must evolve off the agb before the third dredge - up begins , as the final convection would bring the products of helium burning to the surface @xcite .",
    "carbon deficiencies have been observed in hotter objects with a lack of third dredge - up suggested , for example , zng1 in the globular cluster m10 @xcite , barnard 29 in m13 @xcite and hd341617 @xcite .",
    "roa5701 follows the trends seen in typical hot , post - agb stars .",
    "the c abundance is [ c / h ] @xmath10 1.4 @xmath12 0.2 dex , with o and n underabundant by [ o / h ] = 0.8 @xmath12 0.1 dex and [ n / h ] = 0.5 @xmath12 0.2 dex , relative to young b - type stars ( table [ tab_ay ] ) .",
    "hence n , and o to a lesser extent , are enhanced relative to the other elements and the average metallicity of the cluster .",
    "@xcite observe a similar enhancement of n and o relative to the other elements .",
    "however their n abundance is not increased relative to o probably because they observed fewer nii lines . for c",
    ", only an upper limit could be set for the abundance , which indeed is lower than the average metallicity of the cluster .",
    "the c , n and o abundances measured here imply that roa5701 has undergone the first and second dredge - ups as the hydrogen burning products appear to have been brought to the surface .",
    "therefore , the c underabundance suggests that , as with other post - agb stars , roa5701 has left the agb before the onset of the third dredge - up .",
    "we have investigated whether roa5701 could be an agb  manqu star originating from the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) , with diffusion still active and causing the low iron abundance observed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite uses the terminology ehb to describe hb sequences of constant mass that do not reach the thermally pulsing stage on the agb . instead ,",
    "following core helium exhaustion , they evolve into either post early  agb stars , which leave the agb before thermal pulsing , or agb  manqu stars , which never develop extensive outer convective zones and so do not reach the agb .",
    "ehb stars have envelope masses that are too small to reach the end stages of normal agb evolution .",
    "@xcite give the luminosity of roa5701 as log ( l / l@xmath2 ) = 3.2 , which combined with the evidence for the occurance of the first and second dredge - ups implies that roa5701 has evolved along the agb .",
    "therefore , roa5701 does not appear to be an agb  manqu star , so the low iron abundance can not be explained via this scenario .",
    "however , it is reasonable that roa5701 could be a post early  agb star as there is no evidence for the occurance of the third dredge - up , see for example phl1580 and phl174 @xcite , and id6 in ngc5986 @xcite .",
    "assuming that the star has not undergone the third dredge - up or followed a gas  dust separation , the origin of the low fe abundance suggested by @xcite remains unclear .",
    "hence a more detailed investigation into this abundance is required .",
    "as stated previously , it is possible that with higher signal - to - noise optical spectra feiii lines could be detected .",
    "we plan to seek such observational data in the future and examine the _",
    "hst_-uv spectra to improve upon the exisiting iron abundance estimate .",
