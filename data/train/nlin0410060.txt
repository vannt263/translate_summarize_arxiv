    "<S> scattering of solitons and dark solitons by potential walls is studied in the nonlinear schrdinger equation under various conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the conditions under which solitons are split into two solitons at the potential wall . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a soliton can be trapped in an interspace between two potential walls . </S>",
    "<S> a dark soliton can also be scattered at the potential wall . similarly to a bright soliton , a dark soliton can pass through more easily the potential wall , as the width of the dark soliton is larger . </S>",
    "<S> a dark soliton can run away spontaneously from an interspace between the two potential walls . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the motion of a two - dimensional soliton in a two - dimensional quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> we find the coherent tunneling through a potential wall , and the refraction corresponding to newton s refraction theory . </S>"
