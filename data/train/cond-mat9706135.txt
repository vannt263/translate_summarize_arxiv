    "recently a coherent josephson response of the entire ab - plane has been observed in the microwave impedance of @xmath0 single crystals@xcite .",
    "this observation can be considered as a direct indication of the two - condensate nature of the cuprate superconductivity .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to describe the coherent microwave josephson response within the theory of high - temperature superconductivity based on the t - j model and the assumption of a small fermi surface .",
    "there is a controversy in literature about the shape of the fermi surface in cuprate superconductors . in the early days",
    "it was believed that it is the small fermi surface of the doped mott insulator @xcite .",
    "later many of the results from photoelectron spectroscopy ( pes ) have been interpreted as favoring the large fermi surface in agreement with the lattinger s",
    "theorem @xcite . on the other hand the most recent pes",
    "data@xcite once more give indications of the small fermi surface for underdoped samples . in the present paper",
    "we consider the doped mott insulator scenario with the small fermi surface consisting of hole pockets around @xmath1 , see fig.1a .",
    "it is widely believed that the @xmath2 model describes the main details of the doped mott insulator . to fit the experimental hole dispersion",
    "one needs to extend the model introducing additional hopping matrix elements @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( see .",
    "e.g. refs.@xcite ) , but basically it is the @xmath2 model .",
    "superconducting pairing induced by the spin - wave exchange in the @xmath2 model has been considered in the papers @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that there is an infinite set of solutions for the superconducting gap and all the solutions have nodes along the lines @xmath5 , see fig.1a .",
    "( it is very convenient to use the magnetic brillouin zone , but it can certainly be mapped to the full zone . ) using translation by the vector of the inverse magnetic lattice the picture can be reduced to two hole pockets centered around the points @xmath6 , see fig.1a .",
    "the superconducting pairing is the strongest between particles from the same pocket , and the lowest energy solution for the superconducting gap has only one node line in each pocket .",
    "having this solution in a single pocket , one can generate two solutions in the whole brillouin zone taking symmetric or antisymmetric combinations between the pockets .",
    "the symmetric combination corresponds to the d - wave ( fig.1b ) , and the antisymmetric combination corresponds to the g - wave ( fig.1c ) pairing .",
    "a possibility of generating new solutions by taking different combinations between pockets was first demonstrated by scalettar , singh , and zhang in the paper @xcite .",
    "the g - wave pairing in cuprate superconductors has also been considered by buchholtz , palumbo , rainer , and sauls@xcite .",
    "they discussed the most general case of two d - wave order parameters and two g - wave order parameters and their behavior near the surface of the superconductor .",
    "the small fermi surface case considered in the present paper is different , because the pairing exists only in one d - wave channel and in one g - wave channel . on the other hand ,",
    "these two pairings are almost degenerate and therefore the new spatial scale @xmath7 arises .",
    "this scale is much larger than the superconducting correlation length @xmath8 .",
    "the energy splitting between the d- and g - wave solutions in the @xmath9 model has been investigated numerically in the ref.@xcite .",
    "the g - wave solution disappears , and only the d - wave one survives , as soon as the hole dispersion is degenerate along the face of the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "in this situation there are no pockets and one has a large open fermi surface for arbitrary small hole concentration .",
    "however for small well separated pockets the d- and g - wave solutions are almost degenerate . in the pure @xmath2 or @xmath10 model",
    "the d - wave solution always has the lower energy .",
    "however if one extends the model including the nearest sites hole - hole coulomb repulsion , the order can be inverted .",
    "the nearest sites repulsion does not influence the g - wave pairing and substantially suppresses the d - wave pairing .",
    "so it is possible that the real ground state has the g - wave superconducting gap .",
    "we would like to note that the g - wave ground state does not contradict the existing experimental data on the josephson tunneling @xcite . in this case",
    "the tunneling current pumps the g - wave into d - wave in a thin layer near the contact , giving the interference picture which is very close to that for a pure d - wave ground state@xcite . for the present work it does not matter whether the ground state has d - wave or g - wave symmetry .",
    "what is important is that there are two coupled superconducting condensates .",
    "then the idea is straightforward : external microwave field induces josephson transitions between these condensates .",
    "we stress that the condensates are not separated in coordinate space , they coexist at each point and are separated only in k - space .    the possibility of two close condensates has been suggested for conventional superconductors a long time ago by suhl , matthias and walker @xcite .",
    "collective excitations in such a system were considered by legget @xcite , and then rogovin discussed the behavior of the two component system in the external microwave electric field @xcite . in the present work we consider the response of the cuprate superconductor to an external microwave electric field parallel to the ab - plane .",
    "small orthorhombic distortion is not important for this process , and therefore it is neglected .",
    "hence we neglect twinning and consider a single crystal .",
    "according to the microscopic picture described above we should consider simultaneously the d- and g - wave pairings .",
    "let us formulate an effective ginzburg - landau theory describing this situation .",
    "in the first approximation we can neglect the interaction between pockets in k - space",
    ". then half of the holes belong to one pocket and the rest belong to the other pocket , and we should introduce two macroscopic condensates corresponding to the pockets , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the number density of condensate holes .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the system in an external electric field @xmath15 is of the form ( hereafter we set @xmath16 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is ginzburg - landau free energy @xmath19\\right ) + { { e^2}\\over{8\\pi}}\\right\\}dv+f_{\\mbox{{\\small int}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a scalar potential , @xmath21 is an equilibrium number density of condensate holes , and @xmath22 is a small interaction between pockets .",
    "we choose axes x and y to be directed at @xmath23 with respect to the crystal axes a and b. for such choice the mass tensor in each pocket is diagonal and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are corresponding masses . due to symmetry of the pockets @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) and hereafter we assume summation over @xmath25 .",
    "interaction between the pockets is described by term @xmath28 in eq.([f ] ) .",
    "following legget @xcite we use the simplest form of this interaction @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a small parameter of the interaction . for the homogeneous case + @xmath22 @xmath31 @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the total volume .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) is the ginzburg - landau free energy ( [ f ] ) .",
    "the equilibrium values of the order parameters are @xmath34 the ground state phase difference @xmath35 is determined by the sign of @xmath36 . if @xmath37 then @xmath38 and the ground state pairing has g - wave symmetry . if @xmath39 then @xmath40 and the ground state pairing has d - wave symmetry .",
    "note that the free energy ( [ f ] ) is written in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "this approximation is valid if the wavelength of the microwave field is much larger than the superconducting correlation length @xmath41 as well as the scale related to the weak coupling @xmath42 : @xmath43 . in this limit",
    "it is convenient to use a gauge with the scalar potential of the external field @xmath44 and the vector potential @xmath45 . in this gauge",
    "the effect of the vector potential is small and therefore it is neglected in the free energy ( [ f ] ) .",
    "note also that there is an obvious upper limit on the applied electric field : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a typical value of the superconducting gap .",
    "lagrange equations corresponding to ( [ l ] ) are @xmath48 where @xmath49 if p=1 , and @xmath50 if p=2 . to be specific let us consider the case @xmath39 which corresponds to the d - wave ground state .",
    "stiffness of the free energy ( [ f ] ) with respect to variation of @xmath51 is much larger than that with respect to the phases variation .",
    "therefore we can represent the order parameters as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , but the phase @xmath54 is arbitrary . in the linear approximation in @xmath55 the eqs.([le ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath56 we will see below that @xmath57 , i.e. there is no charge density . therefore the scalar potential is due to the external field only : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the amplitude and the frequency of the microwave field . let us introduce the phase @xmath61 , @xmath62 which satisfies the equation @xmath63 after substitution @xmath64 into eqs .",
    "( [ le1 ] ) we obtain equations for @xmath65 and @xmath55 .",
    "we are looking for @xmath65 and @xmath55 independent of coordinates and therefore the terms with spatial derivatives can be omitted resulting in @xmath66 where @xmath67 . first of eqs.([22 ] ) proves that there is no induced charge density : @xmath57 . according to eq .",
    "( [ phi0 ] ) @xmath68 from ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ ae ] ) we find the equation for the relative phase @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the threshold frequency of the phase excitation in the d - g - wave cuprates @xcite .",
    "note that the driving force in this equation reminds of that found in the paper @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ pend ] ) does not contain absorption . in the present work we follow the simplest phenomenological way of just adding a `` friction term '' @xmath72 to the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ pend ] ) rewriting it as @xmath73 > from this equation one immediately derives that absorption is proportional to @xmath74 the form of eq.([pend2 ] ) is identical to the one describing the resistively shunted josephson junction which has been used in the work @xcite for phenomenological description of experimental data , see also ref.@xcite .",
    "we have derived this equation from the microscopic picture based on the small fermi surface .",
    "the derivation gives us all coefficients except the `` friction '' which has been introduced phenomenologically .",
    "this approach allows to find the dependence of the absorption upon direction , amplitude and frequency of the external microwave field .    concluding this section let us calculate the electric current .",
    "@xmath75 in the phase @xmath64 only @xmath61 is dependent on coordinates .",
    "( [ phi0 ] ) one finds @xmath76 this is the usual time dependent meissner current .",
    "dimensionless form of eq . ( [ pend ] )",
    "is @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and the `` dot '' denotes the derivative over dimensionless time @xmath82 .",
    "equation ( [ pend1 ] ) with @xmath83 ( `` overdamped pendulum '' ) has been used in ref.@xcite to describe the experimental data on coherent josephson response of @xmath0 single crystals at microwave frequency @xmath84 .",
    "the data has been fitted with @xmath85 , and we take this value as an experimental result . unfortunately our microscopic calculation does not give the value of @xmath86 .",
    "a reasonable fit of the experimental data @xcite can be obtained with @xmath87 . to be specific",
    "we set @xmath88 , then @xmath89 , which is close to the estimation @xmath90 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the microscopic picture .",
    "results of a numerical calculation of the normalized absorption @xmath91 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "all features of the impedance data @xcite are reproduced and the first step occurs at @xmath92 .",
    "( the critical value of @xmath93 is evident from eq .",
    "( [ pend1 ] ) without any computations . ) this allows one to find the critical field @xmath94 - the field at which the first step occurs .",
    "( [ ae ] ) we find @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the angle between the field and the axis x or y. taking @xmath97 , reduced mass @xmath98 equal to the electron mass , and the frequencies @xmath99 , @xmath100 we find the value of the critical field : @xmath101 .",
    "the experimental critical field is @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "this is in good agreement if we assume that at the surface of the sample the magnetic microwave field is of the order of the electric one .",
    "equation ( [ thr ] ) determines the dependence of the critical field on the microwave frequency and the angle between the field and the x axis @xmath103 note that @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the angle between the electric microwave field and the crystal axes a or b.",
    "we have considered the scenario with the small fermi surface consisting of hole pockets . the small fermi surface together with the mechanism of the magnetic pairing result in the possibility of having two superconducting condensates .",
    "energy splitting between these condensates is small and their linear combinations correspond to the d- and g - wave pairings .",
    "the ground state symmetry depends on the interplay between the magnetic pairing and the coulomb repulsion .",
    "microwave electric field applied in the ab - plane induces josephson transitions between the condensates .",
    "this results in a nonlinear absorption when the entire crystal responds like a single josephson junction .",
    "this could be an explanation of the effect observed recently in @xmath0 single crystals @xcite .",
    "the theoretical estimation for the critical microwave field obtained in the present work @xmath106 is close to the experimental value .",
    "we predict the dependence of the critical field on the microwave frequency and orientation of the microwave electric field with respect to the crystal axes of the cuprate .",
