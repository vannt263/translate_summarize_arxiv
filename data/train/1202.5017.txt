    "the two simplest ways of reconciling the weak energy scale @xmath0 and the much higher gut or reduced planck mass scale @xmath1 in a consistent theory are ( i ) to employ supersymmetry or ( ii ) to introduce one or more warped extra dimensions . in this letter",
    ", we pursue the 5d version of the latter introduced by randall and sundrum  ( rs )  @xcite , but modified in that all fields other than the higgs reside in the bulk . having the gauge and fermion fields in the bulk is needed to adequately suppress flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) operators and operators contributing to precision electroweak ( pew ) corrections  @xcite .    in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "the background rs metric that solves einstein s equations takes the form ds^2=e^-2m_0b_0 |y| _",
    "dx^dx^-b_0 ^ 2dy^2 where @xmath2 is the coordinate for the 5th dimension with @xmath3 .",
    "the graviton and radion fields , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are the quantum fluctuations relative to the background metric @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "in particular , @xmath8 is the quantum degree of freedom associated with fluctuations of the distance between the branes . in the simplest case , only gravity propagates in the bulk",
    "while the sm is located on the infrared ( or tev ) brane at @xmath9 and the interactions of kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons and the radion with the sm are described by _",
    "t^ -_0t_^[int ] where @xmath10 are the kk modes ( with mass @xmath11 ) of the graviton field @xmath4 . in the above , @xmath12 ,",
    "where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the vacuum expectation value of the radion field .",
    "note from eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) that the radion couples to matter with coupling strength @xmath15 .",
    "if matter and gauge fields propagate in the bulk then the interactions of gravitons and the radion with the matter and gauge fields are controlled by the overlap of appropriate 5th - dimensional profiles and corrections to appear .",
    "in addition to the radion , the model contains a conventional higgs boson , @xmath16 .",
    "the rs model provides a simple solution to the hierarchy problem if the higgs is placed on the tev brane at @xmath9 by virtue of the fact that the 4d electro - weak scale @xmath17 is given in terms of the @xmath18 5d higgs vev , @xmath19 , by : @xmath20 for @xmath21 as a result , to solve the hierarchy problem , @xmath22 should not exceed a few tev  @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath23 is a particularly crucial parameter that characterizes the 5-dimensional curvature .",
    "as discussed shortly , large curvature values @xmath24 are favored for fitting the lhc higgs excesses and by bounds on fcnc and pew constraints . in early discussions of the rs model",
    "it was argued that @xmath25 ( @xmath26 being the 5d planck scale and @xmath27 the size of the 5d curvature ) is needed to suppress higher curvature terms in the 5d action , which leads to @xmath28 being preferred .",
    "however @xcite argues that @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 being the energy scale at which the 5d gravity theory becomes strongly coupled , estimated by naive dimensional analysis to be @xmath31 ) is the appropriate measure , implying that values as large as @xmath32 are acceptable . in this regard , the relation between the mass of the 1st kk graviton excitation ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath23 and @xmath34 , =( ) x_1^kk6 , [ monekk ] where @xmath35 is the 1st zero of the bessel function @xmath36 , will require large @xmath23 if the lower bound on @xmath37 is large and @xmath38 .    in the simplest rs scenario ,",
    "the sm fermions and gauge bosons are confined to the brane . however , this is now regarded as highly problematical because the higher - dimensional operators in the 5d effective field theory are suppressed only by @xmath39 and then fcnc processes and pew observable corrections are predicted to be much too large .",
    "this arrangement also provides no explanation of the flavor hierarchies .",
    "it is therefore now regarded as necessary  @xcite to allow all the sm fields ( except the higgs ) to propagate in the extra dimension .",
    "the sm particles are then the zero - modes of the 5d fields and the profile of a sm fermion in the extra dimension can be adjusted using a mass parameter .",
    "if 1st and 2nd generation fermion profiles peak near the planck brane then fcnc operators and pew corrections will be suppressed by scales @xmath40 .",
    "even with this arrangement it is estimated that the @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 masses must be larger than about @xmath44 ( see the summary in @xcite ) . if the gauge bosons and fermions do not propagate in the bulk , then the strongest limits on @xmath34 come , via , from the lower bound placed by the lhc on the first graviton kk excitation ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite for the atlas and cms limits ) . however ,",
    "when the fermions propagate in the bulk , the couplings of light fermion pairs to @xmath33 are greatly reduced and these limits do not apply . when gauge bosons propagate in the bulk , a potentially important experimental limit on the model comes from lower bounds on the 1st excitation of the gluon , @xmath41 . in the model of  @xcite ,",
    "in which light fermion profiles peak near the planck brane , there is a universal component to the light quark coupling @xmath45 that is roughly equal to the sm @xmath46 gauge coupling @xmath47 times a factor of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "the suppression is due to the fact that the light quarks are localized near the planck brane whereas the kk gluon is localized near the tev brane .",
    "even with such suppression , the lhc @xmath41 production rate due to @xmath50 and @xmath51 collisions is large . further , whatever the model , the @xmath52 coupling is large since the @xmath53 profile peaks near the tev brane  the prediction of @xcite is @xmath54 . as a result ,",
    "the dominant decay of the @xmath41 is to @xmath55 .",
    "atlas and cms search for @xmath55 resonances at high mass .",
    "using @xmath56 , @xmath57 , one finds a lower bound of @xmath58 @xcite using an update of the analysis of @xcite .",
    "( @xcite gives a weaker bound of @xmath59 . ) .    in terms of @xmath34",
    ", we have the following relations : = , = - ( 6 ) [ tie ] where @xmath60 is the 1st zero of an appropriate bessel function .",
    "if the model really solves the hierarchy problem then @xmath61 is required .",
    "if we adopt the cms limit of @xmath62 then implies a lower limit on the 5-dimensional curvature of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , a significant lower bound on @xmath64 implies that only relatively large values for @xmath65 are allowed . as discussed above , @xmath23 values up to @xmath66",
    "are probably consistent with curvature corrections to the rs scenario being small .",
    "still , tension between the lower bound on @xmath64 and keeping acceptably small @xmath23 could increase to an unacceptable point as the lhc data set increases .",
    "we will discuss the phenomenology that applies if the value of @xmath34 for any given @xmath67 is tied to the lower bound of @xmath68 using .",
    "alterations to the phenomenology using @xmath69 , as perhaps preferred by pew constraints , will also be illustrated .",
    "however , there are alternative approaches in which a lower bound on @xmath64 from the lhc implies a less tight bound on @xmath34 . for example , including brane kinetic terms localized on the visible brane for gauge fields and gravity will modify the kaluza - klein spectrum and the couplings of the fields @xcite .",
    "in particular , the relation between @xmath23 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 will be modified in such a way that a large lower bound on @xmath70 can still allow @xmath71 sufficiently low that the radion will have phenomenological impact . in this paper , we thus also examine a non - minimal model in which no @xmath23-dependent tie between @xmath64 and @xmath34 is assumed , implying that direct and indirect bounds on @xmath70 do not exclude the relatively low values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 for even relatively low values of @xmath23 .    since the radion and higgs fields have the same quantum numbers , it is generically possible to introduce some amount of mixing between them .",
    "when the higgs is localized on the tev brane , this mixing can be introduced through an action operator that can be written in the form  @xcite : s_=d^4 x r(g_vis)^ , [ grw ] where @xmath74 is the ricci scalar for the metric induced on the visible brane , and @xmath75 is the higgs field in the 5-d context before rescaling to canonical normalization ) . for simplicity we will restrict ourselves to the case of a brane localized higgs . ] .",
    "the physical mass eigenstates , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , are obtained by diagonalizing and canonically normalizing the kinetic ( and mass ) terms in the higgs - radion lagrangian . the diagonalization procedures and results for the @xmath76 and @xmath77 using our notation",
    "can be found in  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .. we also note that in @xcite the coefficients in the @xmath16 decomposition are denoted by @xmath78 and those in the @xmath79 decomposition are denoted @xmath80 ,  the reverse of our conventions .",

    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 are the higgs and radion masses before mixing .",
    "consistency of the diagonalization imposes strong restrictions on the possible @xmath86 values as a function of the final eigenstate masses @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which restrictions depend strongly on the ratio @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the full feynman rules after mixing for the @xmath76 and @xmath77 interactions with gauge bosons and fermions located in the bulk were derived in @xcite .",
    "of particular note are the anomaly terms associated with the @xmath79 interactions before mixing .",
    "to be precise , we give a few details of these important couplings and their implications .",

    "29 of @xcite . without bulk propagation",
    ", these couplings were simply given by sm couplings ( proportional to the metric tensor @xmath102 ) times @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",
    "for the bulk propagation case , there are additional terms in the interaction lagrangian that lead to feynman rules that have terms not proportional to @xmath102 , see @xcite .",

    "the notations and results for the @xmath77 and for @xmath112 are obtained by corresponding modifications .",
    "now , defining @xmath113 and @xmath114 , one finds that the matrix - element - squared for @xmath115 is proportional to ( g_h,^v)^2(1 - 2k^+k^- _ h,^v)^2\\{+r_h,^v+(r_h,^v)^2 } , where @xmath116 .",
    "the sm result would be obtained by setting @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    in the case of fermions propagating in the bulk ,",
    "both the radion and the higgs couplings to sm fermions can be slightly modified .",
    "the couplings of the radion to the tev - brane - localized top quark will receive no corrections with respect to the original setup . however ,",
    "for quarks that are localized near the uv brane ( including the right - handed bottom ) , the modifications to the radion quark couplings can be of order @xmath119% @xcite .",
    "moreover , these coupling modifications are not universal and so will also produce some amount of flavor violation into the couplings of the radion with fermions @xcite . observing any of these effects will be challenging at the lhc and so in general we will neglect them .",
    "even though we neglect bulk effects in yukawa couplings , it is worth commenting further on the possible consequences of fermions propagating in the bulk . as an illustration",
    ", we briefly discuss the case of the unmixed higgs interacting with fermions that are allowed to propagate in the bulk .",
    "the interaction term between the brane higgs and the up - type fermions can be written as _ y= d^4xdy  ( y - y_vis ) ( h |q_ly_1 u_r + h|q_ry_2u_l + h.c ) , [ 5dy ] where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are @xmath122 complex matrices in flavor space .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a setup in which the electroweak gauge symmetry imposed on the model is that of the sm ,  @xmath123 .",
    "the term @xmath124 represents an @xmath46 higgs doublet field localized on the visible brane , whereas @xmath125 and @xmath126 are 5d fermion fields , transforming as doublet and singlet under @xmath46 respectively . note that in general 5d fermions have vectorlike representations , and in order to obtain a chiral low energy theory , one must impose vanishing boundary conditions ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) on the field components @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "doing so eliminates these components from the lowest kaluza klein level , ensuring a chiral theory for the zero - mode fermions ( which are therefore understood to be the sm fermions ) .",
    "the yukawa operators in eq .",
    "( [ 5dy ] ) are localized on the visible brane , and are therefore chiral ,  the left and right handed components of the 5d fermions can be treated differently .",
    "thus , we should generally consider @xmath129 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the operator proportional to @xmath121 leads to the appearance of flavor - violating couplings as well as potentially large corrections to the diagonal higgs yukawa couplings of the effective theory .",
    "these @xmath121-operators can also potentially modify the radiative coupling of the higgs to photons and , especially , to gluons @xcite .",
    "the parametric dependence of these two effects ( the corrections to the higgs - fermion couplings and the correction to the higgs - gluon coupling ) is the same and goes as @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the mass scale of the kk fermions and @xmath132 is the higgs vev .",
    "perturbativity requires @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "as the size of these 5d yukawa couplings is reduced , so are the corrections induced . in fact , to successfully generate the sm fermion masses only the @xmath120 operator is needed ,  @xmath121 terms are not necessary .",
    "thus , if we take @xmath134 so as to avoid @xmath121-induced flavor violating couplings then large @xmath120 values are possible with no corrections to the higgs couplings . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath135 is as large as possible and @xmath136 is small , this will reduce fcnc effects coming from the kk gluon excitations @xcite as well as those from yukawa higgs couplings . in what follows",
    ", we adopt this limit and neglect the @xmath121-induced corrections to higgs couplings . and @xmath121 , can be of order tens of percent @xcite . ] finally , we note that corrections to the @xmath137 couplings from kk @xmath105 excitations were shown in  @xcite to be @xmath138 and will be neglected in our study .    with all this in mind ,",
    "our goal here in this paper is to illustrate the complexity of the phenomenology of the higgs - radion system in the context of lhc data .",
    "we will show in particular that an approximate fit to the most prominent `` excesses '' in the higgs search data can be explained in the context of the model .",
    "earlier papers on this topic include @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and @xcite .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) data from the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations suggests the possibility of a fairly standard model ( sm ) like higgs boson with mass of order @xmath139 .",
    "in particular , promising hints appear of a narrow excess over background in the @xmath92 and @xmath140 final states with strong supporting evidence from the @xmath141 mode .",
    "the atlas results suggest that the @xmath92 and @xmath142 rates may be significantly enhanced with respect to the sm expectation at a mass near @xmath143 .",
    "the cms @xmath92 rate is maximal for @xmath144 and also appears to be somewhat enhanced with respect to the sm expectation . at this mass",
    "the cms signals in other channels , including @xmath145 and @xmath142 are roughly consistent with the expectation for a sm higgs .",
    "in addition , cms data shows excesses in the @xmath142 rate near @xmath146 ( at which mass they do not see a @xmath92 excess ) and in the @xmath92 rates near @xmath147 ( at which mass there is no @xmath142 excess ) , but neither is confirmed in the atlas data .",
    "one important point regards the @xmath148 final state .",
    "the signal for a scalar state of any given mass will be spread out into many bins of a variable such as the transverse mass , @xmath149 , as a result of the missing energy carried by the neutrinos .",
    "thus , if there are two scalar states that have equal production cross section times @xmath100 branching ratio both may contribute but their contribution will depend upon the analysis cuts applied .",
    "this contrasts with the @xmath140 channel ( the only @xmath101 channel analyzed for scalar masses below @xmath150 ) and the @xmath92 channel both of which have excellent mass resolution so that excesses should appear centered on the scalar state masses . for this reason",
    ", we focus on these latter channels .    in the context of the higgs - radion model",
    ", positive signals can only arise for two masses .",
    "if more than two excesses were to ultimately emerge , then a more complicated higgs sector will be required than the single @xmath16 case we study here .",
    "certainly , one can consider including extra higgs singlets or doublets .",
    "for the moment , we presume that there are at most two excesses . in this case , it is sufficient to pursue the single higgs plus radion model .",
    "we will consider three cases , labelled as atlas , cmsa and cmsb .",
    "we quantify the excesses in terms of the best fit value for @xmath151 for a given final state @xmath152 .",
    "errors quoted for the excesses are those for @xmath153 . the mass locations and excesses in the @xmath92 and @xmath142 channels in these three cases , tabulated in table  [ exc ] , are taken from figs .",
    "8a and 8b of @xcite in the atlas case and from the appropriate windows of fig .",
    "14 of @xcite in the case of cmsa and cmsb :     & @xmath154 & @xmath147 atlas & @xmath155 , @xmath156 & no excesses & no excesses cmsa & @xmath157 , @xmath158 & @xmath159 , @xmath160 & no excesses cmsb & @xmath157 , @xmath158 & no excesses & @xmath161 , @xmath162    [ exc ]    to an excellent approximation , only the @xmath91 initial state is relevant for inclusive @xmath76 and @xmath77 production followed by decay to @xmath92 or @xmath140 and so we will be comparing the ratios r_h(x),r_(x ) , where numerator and denominator are computed for the same mass , to the atlas , cmsa and cmsb @xmath163 values quoted above .",
    "we also note that cms gives results for @xmath164 relative to @xmath165 with @xmath166 in the sm at @xmath146 and @xmath167 of @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively . no measurement for the @xmath170 final state",
    "is quoted for @xmath147 .",
    "finally , cms has recently given results at @xmath143 for the @xmath92 final state in which the @xmath100 fusion induced rate is separated from the @xmath91 fusion induced rate @xcite .",
    "they find a ratio relative to the sm prediction for @xmath171 of @xmath172 at @xmath143 .",
    "removing this @xmath100 fusion component from the inclusive @xmath92 final state gives a @xmath91 fusion ratio of @xmath173 .",
    "were the @xmath174 and @xmath175 enhancements to both persist with increased statistics , it will be a huge challenge to the higgs - radion approach ( as we shall discuss ) as well as to other models .",
    "we note that the error bars on the sm multipliers for the atlas , cmsa and cmsb scenarios are large and we regard it as likely that the central values will surely change with more integrated luminosity at the lhc .",
    "increased integrated luminosity will hopefully increase the agreement between the atlas and cms excesses , but could also worsen the consistency , or perhaps even lead to the disappearance of the excesses .",
    "thus , the comparisons below should only be taken as illustrative of the possibilities .",
    "( note that our plots are always done with either @xmath87 or @xmath88 equal to @xmath143 as appropriate for the atlas excess .",
    "however , there is no change in the plots if we use @xmath167 , as more precisely appropriate to the central value of the cmsa and cmsb excesses . )    as discussed above , it is appropriate to consider two different kinds of models : a basic model in which a strong lower bound on the mass of the first excited gluon implies a significant lower bound on @xmath34 as a function of @xmath23 and a model with non - minimal extensions such that a fixed ( low ) value of @xmath34 can be considered for the full range of @xmath23 even if there is a significant lower bound on @xmath64 .",
    "we consider these two alternatives in turn .      in this section",
    ", we consider a model along the lines of @xcite in which fcnc and pew constraints are satisfied by virtue of the fermionic profiles being peaked fairly close to the planck brane leading to fairly definitive couplings of the fermions to the excited gauge bosons .",
    "as described earlier , a lower bound of @xmath176 can be obtained from lhc data while fcnc and pew constraints suggest a still higher bound of @xmath177 .",
