    "in this paper we review infrared space observatory observations of ring galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are believed to represent the unusual class of collisional system in which one of the galaxies plunges through the center of a second larger disk system , creating radially driven waves which can trigger star formation in rings .",
    "although the majority of the nearby examples do not significantly exceed far - ir luminosities of 10@xmath3 l@xmath4 , a recent hst study of ultra - luminous far - ir galaxies by borne et al .",
    "( 1999 ) shows many more distant examples of ring systems that exceed 10@xmath5 l@xmath4 .",
    "indeed , because of the rarity of rings in the nearby universe , large volumes of the universe need to be studied in order to build up a complete picture of the range of properties of these fascinating systems .",
    "these rare colliding galaxies have the advantage over more general collisional systems in that they are conceptually simple , symmetrical and the star formation around the ring is triggered almost simultaneously ( see recent review by appleton & struck - marcell ( 1996 ) ) .",
    "many of the nearby cases have been studied from the ground in considerable detail at many wavelengths .",
    "this conference has highlighted the need to understand ir and sub - mm galaxy number counts , and the need for significant luminosity evolution in galaxies , especially at redshifts in excess of z = 0.5 to 1 where the luminosity evolution has to increase rapidly to fit these emerging data .",
    "lavery et al .",
    "( 1996 ) has begun a major search of ring galaxies in deep hst archive images , and has found evidence for a large increase in the collision rate of these galaxies with redshift .",
    "it may not be surprising to find that the assembly of gas rich disk systems is a messy process , involving collisions between disk fragments at high velocity within loose galaxy potentials , creating high redshift analogs of these locally rare collisions .",
    "one challenge for the study of these systems is to understand the variety of ways in which gas is converted efficiently into stars , and what role , if any , is played by active nuclei in either hindering or encouraging the conversion of matter into luminous energy on both the small and large scales .",
    "the sample of galaxies discussed here ranges from examples of galaxies with little or no nucleus or any kind , to violently interacting ring galaxies containing high - speed gas flows and agns . in one case ,",
    "ngc 985 , isocam imaging reveals new near - nuclear features not seen at shorter wavelengths , which may relate to the interaction of high - speed winds from the agn with infalling gas from the galaxy on the kpc scale .",
    "all the observations presented here were made with isocam in various raster modes ( usually 2 x 2 raster mapping ) and typical integration times per filter of 10 minutes ( see table 1 for details and references to more detailed papers ) .",
    ".the ring galaxies imaged by isocam [ cols=\"<,>,^,<,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab1a ]    ring designations from theys & spiegel ( 1976 )    details on the isocam filters can be found in the isocam observers manual ( _ http://isowww.estec.esa.nl/manuals/iso_cam _ )    charmandaris et al .",

    "figure 1 shows an example of one classical `` smoke ring '' called vii  zw  466 observed with isocam and detected in three filters ( from appleton et al .",
    "this galaxy has been studied in considerable detail from the ground and comprises of an outer ring of powerful hii regions and fainter redder light which fills the interior of the ring ( see bransford et al .",
    "1999a for further references ) .",
    "the likely intruder ( the edge - on spiral to the south of the ring , g1-see appleton charmandaris & struck ( 1996 ) for details ) is also detected .",
    "figure 2 displays how the ir emission follows loosely the distribution of optical emission - line sites , but that it is not a one to one correlation .",
    "similarly , vla radio observations , which trace thermal and non - thermal plasma compressed in the expanding ring , do not follow exactly the distribution of either the warm dust or the optical nebulae .",
    "rather the radio emission tends to be concentrated on the inside - edge of the ring .",
    "the results , which are discussed in much more detail by appleton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , suggest that 10% of the available thermal uv luminosity is re - radiated in the mir .",
    "point - to - point variations in mir emission from within the galaxy compared with the underlying heat sources may be due to a number of effects  variations in dust filling factors and geometry  variations in the destruction rate of the small grains involved , as well as differences in the chemistry of the grains themselves .",
    "these sorts of variations , which are seen in other nearby galaxies , underline the difficulties that may ensue in trying to create a `` standard galaxy '' template for use in models that attempt to reproduce logn / logs diagrams for high - z galaxies .",
    "care must especially be taken when k - corrections involve bands contaminated by mid - ir uib features .",
    "images , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure 3 shows some early ukirt j , h and k - band maps of the cartwheel ring from marcum , appleton & higdon ( 1992 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the iso detection of warm dust from the ring ( from charmandaris et al .",
    "1999 ) , and emphasizes how different the near and mid - ir distributions are . in most cases ,",
    "k- band imaging traces the stellar component ( the recently formed star clusters ) whereas the mir emission is sensitive to warm dust heated by the uv from hot stars .",
    "the iso observations show that the outer ring is more easily detected at shortern mir wavelengths ( where the emission is most likely dominated by uib features around 6 - 7 microns ) , and is rather weak at longer wavelengths .",
    "one initial surprise was the detection of significant mir flux from the inner regions of the cartwheel where star formation activity is believed to be minimal .",
    "horellou et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have recently obtained clear evidence for a large concentration of molecular material in the central regions of the cartwheel .",
    "it now seems likely that low - level , but quite extended star formation may be occurring over the inner ring regions of the cartwheel , perhaps a precursor to much more powerful activity in the near future .",
    "it is not yet clear whether this star formation is triggered by infall from the outer disk , debris from the collision impacting the center , or just mild compression of the gas in the inner disk by passage through the second ring .",
    "two systems ( ngc 985 and arp 188 = ngc 1144/5 ) have fir luminosities which are approaching those of ultra - luminous galaxies . both have rings , agns , and neither is very simple in optical morphology . in the case of arp 118 ( charmandaris et al . , in preparation ) ,",
    "the mir emission originates from a bright featureless continuum source associated with the nucleus , and a very extended but bright concentrations of emission associated with a powerful extra - nuclear hii regions .",
    "this latter emission is dominated by uib spectral features ( probably polycyclic aromatic hydrocarborns ) , and emphasizes the composite nature of the mir spectra of some seyfert galaxies .",
    "the galaxy ngc 985 is a ring galaxy with a bright `` knot '' embedded in the outer ring ( rodrigues - espinosa & stanga 1990 ) .",
    "optical and ir observations show that the `` knot '' is composed of two nuclei , a seyfert-1 nucleus , and a second `` spiral bulge '' 3 arcsecs to the north - west of the seyfert nucleus ( perez - garcia & rodrigues - espinosa 1996 , appleton & marcum 1993 ) .",
    "this has led to the conclusion that ngc 985 consists of two galaxies undergoing a merger ; the agn lying at the center of the nucleus of one galaxy , and the second nucleus corresponding to the other .",
    "if one of the nuclei is the original nucleus of the `` target '' galaxy , then it must be significantly displaced from the ring center .",
    "this suggests that we are viewing the early stages of a highly off - center merging collision , since dynamical friction would quickly center the collision if we were witnessing the event at a later time .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that the molecular gas is still quite extended in this system ( horellou et al . , 1996 ) , unlike a well evolved merger , where the molecular gas is often concentrated in the nucleus .",
    "figure 5 shows a sequence of isocam images of the galaxy in three bands ( 9.6 , 11 and 15 microns ) .",
    "the off - center `` bulge and nucleus '' are easily detected ( but not resolved ) in all bands , as well as the brightest hii regions in the western edge of the ring .",
    "an unusual feature of the isocam maps is seen when the images are further processed .",
    "for example , the inset shows the effect of applying an unsharp - masking technique to the image .",
    "the inset shows that a curved arc - like structure is seen about 5 arcsecs north - west of the seyfert nucleus .",
    "the arc - feature does not correspond to the second nucleus seen in the early near - ir observations ( appleton & marcum 1993 ) , but is a little beyond it .",
    "the structure is not an artifact of the unsharp - masking , since it is seen in the original data , and is also reproduced when a symmetrical gaussian profile is removed from the seyfert nucleus .",
    "the structure , though strong at 15 microns ( where the signal to noise ratio is highest ) , is also seen in both the lw7 and 8 filters , confirming its reality .",
    "one possible explanation for the structure is that is defines a cooling shock - front driven into infalling gas from the outer ring as it collides with a wind from the seyfert nucleus .",
    "one attractive aspect of this picture is that it explains why the `` arc '' is not a complete shell around the nucleus",
    ". models of collisions between galaxies which form off - center rings ( e.g. appleton & struck - marcell 1987b ) predict that the strongest gaseous infall will occur on the side of the disk most strongly compressed in the collision .",
    "this is precisely the case here  the largest gas flows inwards are expected from material falling inwards from the n - w side of the ring where the ring is most sharply defined .",
    "mid and far - ir spectroscopy of the `` arc '' feature would help to determine if the feature shows shock - excitation consistent with this simple hypothesis .",
    "a mid - ir survey ( ! ) of collisional ring galaxies has yielded some interesting results .",
    "these are :    * the mir flux is at least 10% of total thermal uv continuum , in even the low - luminosity examples of these galaxies .",
    "it is not yet known if this fraction depends on the degree of compactness of the collisional system , nor how this ratio changes in more distant ultra - luminous ring galaxies ( e.g. borne et al 1999 ) .",
    "* a rough correspondence ( but not always 1 to 1 ) between star formation sites and mir emission regions is seen in most cases . differences may reflect clumpy dust distributions , incomplete filling factors , thermal spiking ( especially in uib affected bands ) , and also possible variations in grain chemistry from region to region .",
    "such variations suggest that creating `` mean galaxy '' templates for use in interpreting logn / logs galaxy number counts may be unreliable , especially if some of the bands are dominated by uib features . *",
    "near - nuclear emission is common in seyfert ring galaxies . in arp 118 ,",
    "the seyfert nucleus is devoid of uib features , but very powerful extra- nuclear starformation sites are dominated by uib features . such a galaxy ,",
    "if viewed from a distance , would exhibit a composite mir spectrum , complicating the clear separation of agn and starburst on the basis of mir spectral features alone . in ngc 985",
    ", a dust arc is discovered in the mir on the kpc ",
    "scale near the seyfert 2 nucleus .",
    "this feature , which has not been seen at shorter wavelengths , may represent a shock wave driven into neutral or molecular gas by the agn wind .",
    "the geometrical asymmetry of the `` arc '' might be expected on the grounds of asymmetric infall which is predicted in highly off - center ring galaxy collision models . * in the cartwheel , extended nuclear emission seen in mir which was not expected based on optical imaging .",
    "this emphasizes the fact that iso is can be sensitive to low - level distributed star formation which might but rather difficult to detect optically in dusty regions .",
