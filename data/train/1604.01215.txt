    "we study a model problem describing vibrational resonance @xcite by means of the high - order averaging technique introduced in the series of articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see @xcite for a summary ) .    in devices with vibrational resonance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the response of a system driven by a low - frequency forcing",
    "may be enhanced by the presence of high - frequency vibrations of suitable amplitude .",
    "such devices feature in several current applications , including energy harvesting @xcite , @xcite , where the aim is to exploit the energy contained in the vibrations by converting it into electrical energy .",
    "the corresponding systems of differential equations are _ highly oscillatory _ in the sense that their solutions include periods much shorter than the time interval of interest .",
    "the numerical integration of such systems may be a very expensive task , as , typically , numerical integrators have to operate with step sizes significantly shorter than the shortest period present in the solution and the simulation has to be carried out over many periods .",
    "the literature contains many suggestions of nonstandard integrators to be applied in highly oscillatory situations , including the heterogeneous multiscale method @xcite , @xcite , methods with multiple time steps @xcite , multirevolution techniques @xcite , etc .",
    "however the use of such ad hoc integrators is prone to unexpected instabilities and inaccuracies @xcite .",
    "averaging techniques are very useful to deal with oscillatory problems ; they may be applied in combination with numerical integration , to soften  the difficulties of the system to be simulated numerically , or in a purely analytical way .",
    "there are many techniques to carry out the computations required by the method of averaging ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ; here we use the _ word series _ @xcite approach introduced in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . with the technique applied here ,",
    "the tasks of constructing the averaged system and the associated change of variables are divided into two parts .",
    "it is first necessary to build recursively a set of so - called _ word basis _ functions and , after that , all the required manipulations involve only scalar coefficients that are computed by means of simple recursions . as distinct from the situation with other approaches , with word - series high - order averaged systems may be derived without having to compute the associated change of variables .",
    "the use of word series techniques is not confined to averaging ; word series may be applied to compute normal forms of discrete or continuous dynamical systems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , find formal invariants of differential systems @xcite , analyze numerical integrators @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "section 2 provides a brief summary of the averaging technique we employ .",
    "it should be emphasized that while , for the sake of simplicity , this summary is restricted to the case of _ periodic _ forcing , the technique may be applied to",
    "_ quasiperiodic _",
    "problems without essential changes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "section 3 studies a model problem taken from the original reference on vibrational resonance by landa and mcclintock @xcite .",
    "we show how averaging provides insight into the mechanism causing vibrational resonance ; this mechanism is related to the creation of an effective potential , akin e.g. to that responsible for stabilizing kapitza s inverted pendulum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the construction of high - order averaged systems makes it possible to get very precise approximations to the true dynamics of the system under investigation .",
    "the example here is based on the overdamped oscillator ; the technique may be equally applied to underdamped models @xcite , @xcite . work to extend our study to realistic devices that exhibit vibrational resonance is under way .",
    "after fourier expansion , we may assume that the periodic problem to be studied is of the form : @xmath0 in the averaging technique used here , the elements ( indices ) @xmath1 in are seen as the _ letters _ of an alphabet and each ( possibly empty ) string of letters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , is called a _ word_. the symbol @xmath4 is used to denote the set of all words . with each word",
    "@xmath5 we associate a _ word basis function _ @xmath6 . for the empty word , @xmath7 is the identity map @xmath8 in @xmath9 . for nonempty words the @xmath10",
    "are constructed recursively from the @xmath11 that feature in .",
    "the recipe is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the jacobian matrix of @xmath14 .",
    "we define @xmath15 as the set ( vector space ) of all mappings @xmath16 ; if @xmath17 and @xmath5 , @xmath18 represents the complex number that @xmath19 associates with @xmath20 . to each @xmath17 there",
    "corresponds a _ word series _ @xmath21    with this terminology , the main result from @xcite is as follows .",
    "consider the _ averaged _ problem @xmath22 and the time - dependent _ change of variables _ @xmath23 where the coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath5 , necessary to write the word series may be computed explicitly ( see below ) . then the solution @xmath26 of",
    "may be represented as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the solution of .",
    "the change of variables is @xmath29 periodic in @xmath30 and , in addition , at the stroboscopic times @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 coincide . in general the series in the right hand - sides of and do not converge and have to be truncated as demonstrated in the next section . with the help of such truncations it is possible to approximate @xmath34 accurately without solving the oscillatory problem .",
    "the coefficients @xmath24 are computed recursively by means of the formulas @xmath35 here the integer @xmath36 is @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , denotes the word consisting of @xmath40 zeros .",
    "note that , from these formulas , @xmath41 is of size @xmath42 for @xmath43 letter words @xmath20 , @xmath44 .",
    "the , very similar formulas for the coefficients @xmath45 may be seen in @xcite .",
    "the following one - dimensional overdamped double - well oscillator @xmath46 has been considered in @xcite as a simple model to demonstrate vibrational resonance .",
    "here @xmath47 , the parameter @xmath48 represents the amplitude of the applied driving force and @xmath49 measures the size of the fast background vibration .",
    "we note that in @xcite the vibrational term is written in the alternative format @xmath50 rather than as @xmath51 . since no hypotheses are made in what follows as to the size of @xmath52 , both formats are equivalent ; when @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given specific numerical values the problem considered in @xcite may be cast in the form by defining @xmath55 .",
    "however writing the amplitude of the vibration as @xmath56 is more meaningful than writing it as @xmath53 because if one sees @xmath54 as a parameter and keeps @xmath57 constant then it is clear that for @xmath54 sufficiently large the vibrational term @xmath58 can not be expected to exert any significant influence as it converges weakly to zero .",
    "we begin by removing from the @xmath59 term by means of the preliminary change of variables @xmath60 ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 coincide at the stroboscopic times @xmath63 ) , which leads to @xmath64 note that the conservative force @xmath65 in has been softened  to @xmath66 in . in terms of the corresponding potentials ,",
    "we have moved from @xmath67 , with wells of depth @xmath68 at @xmath69 to the new symmetric _ effective _ potential @xmath70 as @xmath71 increases from @xmath72 , the depth of the wells decreases and for @xmath73 the two potential minima are merged into a single minimum at @xmath74 .    by considering an auxiliary variable @xmath75 with @xmath76 and the vector @xmath77 , takes the form studied in the preceding section with @xmath78 @xmath79 equal to the complex conjugate of @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "letters for two different values of the parameter @xmath52 that measures the amplitude of the background vibration . in each panel",
    "the oscillatory solution appears as a band due to its fast dynamics ; the averaged solution ( in the centre of the band ) varies at a much lower rate . a small increase in @xmath52 from @xmath84 ( top panel ) to @xmath85 ( bottom panel ) lets the oscillator make substantially wider excursions without having to increment the amplitude @xmath86 of the applied forcing .",
    "]    truncating the averaged system to keep only contributions corresponding to words of one letter results in @xmath87= \\left[\\begin{matrix}\\nu\\\\ y -\\frac{3}{2 } b^2 y   -y^3+a",
    "\\cos \\phi \\end{matrix}\\right],\\ ] ] i.e.  the effect of averaging is only to remove the terms of that involve the background vibration . a simple computation of the required basis functions and coefficients that may be carried out by hand shows that truncating after two letter words yields @xmath88 ( as expected ) and @xmath89 thus the addition of two - letter words introduces corrections of size @xmath90 .",
    "the new _ effective _ potential @xmath91 has lost the @xmath92 symmetry and the amplitude @xmath93 of the slow driving forcing has been incremented by an amount @xmath94 .    due to the absence of fast vibrations , may be integrated numerically with high accuracy with a negligible computational effort .",
    "we have done so for the values ( taken from @xcite ) @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "the initial condition is set to be @xmath98 , so that the oscillator starts at one of the minima of the potential well of .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig ] shows accurate numerical solution of and for two values of @xmath49 . in each panel",
    "the oscillatory solution appears as a band due to its fast dynamics ; the averaged solution varies at a much lower rate and is sufficient to describe the behaviour of the system . when @xmath84 , the motion is essentially confined to the basin of the potential minimum at @xmath98 ; a small @xmath99 increment in @xmath52 is sufficient to let the moving particle visit the basin of the minimum at @xmath100 without having to increase the amplitude @xmath93 of the driving forcing , thus demonstrating the existence of vibrational resonance .",
    "note that , once the stationary regime is attained , the averaged solution is periodic with period @xmath101 and , as discussed above , does not have the @xmath92 symmetry .       as pointed out",
    "before , the solution @xmath102 of approximates the true solution @xmath61 at stroboscopic times . if approximations to @xmath61 at non - stroboscopic times are also of interest , they may be easily obtained ( without additional numerical integrations ) by applying to the numerically computed @xmath102 the change of variables ( see ) .",
    "if the change is truncated to exclude words with three or more letters , for the runs in figure  [ fig : fig ] the maximum on @xmath103 of the magnitude of the discrepancy between the true @xmath61 and the approximation obtained in this way is 0.080 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath85 .",
    "additional corrections of sizes @xmath106 , @xmath107 ,   may be added to by considering words with three , four ,   letters .",
    "explicit formulas for the @xmath106 terms ( three - letter words ) are given in @xcite .",
    "the number of words to be considered increases exponentially with the length of the word .",
    "the second column of table  [ table : table ] gives , for each @xmath108 , the number of words with @xmath109 letters for which the associated basis function @xmath6 is not identically zero .",
    "by using a computer algebra programme we have found the corrections of size @xmath106 ,  , @xmath110 .",
    "the corresponding averaged systems are not reproduced here for obvious reasons .    for the parameter values used in figure",
    "[ fig : fig ] , we have integrated numerically the averaged system based on words with @xmath111 letters @xmath112 . also listed in table  [ table : table ] is the maximum error over @xmath103 when @xmath113 is approximated by applying the change of variables including words of 1 , 2 ,  , @xmath109 letters to the numerical solution of the averaged system employing the same words .",
    "it is apparent that the higher - order averaged systems , which , as emphasized before , may be easily integrated numerically , provide accurate approximations to the true oscillatory solution .    we are thankful to m. a. f. sanjun for bringing this problem to our attention and carefully reading the manuscript .",
