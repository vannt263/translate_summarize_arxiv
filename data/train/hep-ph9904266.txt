    "recent advances in string theories suggest that a special 11-dimension theory ( dubbed as m theory ) @xcite may be the theory of everything .",
    "impacts of m theory on our present world can be studied with compactification of the 11 dimensions down to our @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "the path of compactification is , however , not unique . in this multi - dimensional world , the standard model particles live on a brane ( @xmath3 dim ) while there are other fields , like gravity and super yang - mill fields , live in the bulk .",
    "the scale at which the extra dimensions are felt is unknown , anywhere from tev to planck scale .",
    "recent studies @xcite show that if this scale is of order tev and there are gauge and fermion fields living in the bulk that correspond to the kaluza - klein excitations of the gauge and fermion fields of the sm , early unification of gauge couplings can be realized below or even much below the original gut scale .",
    "this is possible because the extra matters in the bulk accelerate the rge running of the gauge couplings , which then change from logarithmic evolution to power evolution .",
    "supersymmetry model building is also an active area in the framework of extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "apart from the above , radical ideas like tev scale string theories were also proposed @xcite .",
    "inspired by string theories a simple but probably workable solution to the gauge hierarchy was recently proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) @xcite .",
    "they assumed the space is @xmath4 dimensional , with the sm particles living on a brane .",
    "while the electromagnetic , strong , and weak forces are confined to this brane , gravity can propagate in the extra dimensions .",
    "to solve the gauge hierarchy problem they proposed the `` new '' planck scale @xmath5 is of the order of tev in this picture with the extra dimensions of a very large size @xmath6 .",
    "the usual planck scale @xmath7 gev is related to this effective planck scale @xmath5 using the gauss s law : @xmath8 for @xmath9 it gives a large value for @xmath6 , which is already ruled out by gravitational experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath10 gives @xmath11 mm , which is in the margin beyond the reach of present gravitational experiments .",
    "the graviton including its excitations in the extra dimensions can couple to the sm particles on the brane with an effective strength of @xmath12 ( instead of @xmath13 ) after summing the effect of all excitations collectively , and thus the gravitation interaction becomes comparable in strength to weak interaction at tev scale .",
    "hence , it can give rise to a number of phenomenological activities testable at existing and future colliders @xcite .",
    "so far , studies show that there are two categories of signals : direct and indirect .",
    "the indirect signal refers to exchanges of gravitons in the intermediate states , while direct refers to production or associated production of gravitons in the final state @xcite .",
    "indirect signals include fermion pair , gauge boson pair production , correction to precision variables , etc .",
    "@xcite . there are also other astrophysical and cosmological signatures and constraints @xcite .",
    "processes that only occur via loop diagrams in the sm are especially interesting if the low scale gravity allows tree - level interactions . in the sm ,",
    "the lowest order photon - photon scattering can only take place via box diagrams of order @xmath14 ( on amplitude level ) @xcite and , therefore , is highly suppressed .",
    "thus , photon - photon scattering opens an interesting door for any tree - level photon interactions .",
    "even if such new interactions are much weaker than the electroweak strength , these tree - level diagrams are only of order @xmath15 .",
    "it stands a good chance that these new interactions can beat the standard model . in the framework of",
    "add , photons can scatter via exchanges of spin-2 gravitons in @xmath16- , @xmath17- , and @xmath18-channels and the most important is that the coupling strength can be as large as the electroweak strength . in this work",
    ", we shall study the photon - photon scattering @xmath19 and demonstrate that it provides a unique channel to identify the low scale gravity interactions .",
    "other interesting processes of the same category is @xmath20 and the cross - channel , @xmath21 , both of which do not have any tree - level contributions in the sm @xcite .",
    "we shall not pursue these two further in this paper .",
    "similarly , a pair of gluons can scatter into gluons or photons via exchanges of gravitons , the latter of which is our attention at hadron colliders .",
    "the lowest order @xmath22 scattering occurs via a @xmath16-channel exchange of graviton in the low scale gravity model whereas it has to be via box diagrams in the sm .",
    "thus , the new gluon scattering will give rise to anomalous diphoton production , in addition to the @xmath23 channel , at hadron colliders .",
    "however , the tree - level sm @xmath24 presents a large irreducible background , not to mention the jet - fake background .",
    "this makes the diphoton production at hadron colliders not as attractive as in @xmath0 and @xmath2 colliders as a probe to the low scale gravity model . for completeness",
    "we also study the diphoton production at @xmath2 colliders .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we compare the photon - photon scattering cross section between the sm and the low scale gravity . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate diphoton production at the tevatron and obtain the present limit on the cut - off scale @xmath5 using the diphoton data , and then estimate the sensitivity reach at the run ii . in sec .",
    "iv , we repeat the same exercise at @xmath2 colliders and obtain the limits using the diphoton data from lepii , and estimate the sensitivity reach at the future linear @xmath2 colliders",
    ". we shall then conclude in sec .",
    "we concentrate on the spin-2 component of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) states , which are the excited modes of graviton in the extra dimensions .",
    "the spin-0 component has a coupling to the gauge boson proportional to the mass of the gauge boson in the unitary gauge , which means it has a zero coupling to photons .",
    "we follow the convention in ref.@xcite .",
    "there are three contributing feynman diagrams for the process @xmath19 in the @xmath16- , @xmath17- , and @xmath18-channels .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath25 are given by : @xmath26\\ ; [ -p_2 \\cdot k_2\\ , c_{\\mu'\\nu',\\sigma\\beta } + d_{\\mu'\\nu',\\sigma\\beta } ( p_2,-k_2 ) ] \\ ; , \\\\",

    "the propagator factor @xmath31 , where @xmath32 sums over all kk levels .",
    "after some tedious algebra the square of the amplitude , summed over final and averaged over the initial helicities , is surprisingly simple : @xmath33 where we have taken @xmath34 and in this case the propagator factor @xmath35 @xcite , which is given by @xmath36 where the factor @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 the angular distribution is @xmath39 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is from @xmath41 to 1 . since the cross section scales as @xmath42 , which implies larger cross sections at higher @xmath43 .",
    "the sm background calculation is well known and we do not repeat the expressions here .",
    "we used the results in ref .",
    "@xcite with the form factors from ref .",
    "the process is via box diagrams with all charged fermions and the @xmath44 boson in the loop . at the low energy , the fermion contribution dominates , but once @xmath43 gets above a hundred gev the @xmath44 contribution becomes more important and completely dominates at higher @xmath43 .",
    "we show the cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig - aa](a ) .",
    "this sm cross section decreases gradually when @xmath43 is above 500 gev .",
    "in contrast , the low scale gravity interactions give a monotonically increasing cross section . for @xmath10 and @xmath45",
    "tev the cross - over is at about @xmath46 gev .",
    "we notice that the signal cross section does not decrease very rapidly with @xmath47 , unlike the production of real gravitons @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - aa](b ) , we show the angular distribution for the low scale gravity and for the sm .",
    "the signal has a relatively flat distribution , as can be easily deduced from eq .",
    "( [ aa - cos ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the cross section at @xmath48 to that at @xmath49 is only @xmath50 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sm background is very steep around @xmath49 , and that is why a cut of @xmath51 is imposed to reduce the background .",
    "monochromatic photon beam can be realized using the back - scatter laser technique @xcite by shining a laser beam onto an electron or positron beam .",
    "a linear @xmath2 collider can be converted into an almost monochromatic photon - photon collider , with a center - of - mass energy about 0.8 of the parent @xmath2 collider and with a luminosity the same order as the parent , i.e. , as large as 50100 fb@xmath52 per year .",
    "since the cross section for the sm is of the order of 10 fb , so there should be enough events for doing a counting experiment .",
    "a 510 % deviation from the sm prediction would be at a @xmath53 level .",
    "we use the 5% or 10% deviation from the sm as the criterion for sensitivity reach .",
    "the sensitivity reach at the @xmath0 collider is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - aa - limit ] .",
    "the reach on @xmath5 is about 58 ( 4.57.5 ) times of the center - of - mass energy of the collider for @xmath54 using the 5% ( 10% ) deviation criterion .",
    "as we shall see later , the sensitivity reach at photon - photon colliders is better than at @xmath2 and much better than at hadron colliders .",
    "diphoton production has been an interesting subject for cdf and d0 .",
    "it can provide constraints on the @xmath55 type contact interactions , anomalous @xmath56 and @xmath57 couplings . in the context of the low scale gravity",
    ", diphotons can be produced via quark - antiquark and gluon - gluon annihilation into virtual gravitons and the associated kk states .",
    "the gluon - gluon annihilation is very similar to the photon - photon scattering described in the last section .",
    "the main background is the sm lowest order process : @xmath58 .",
    "is much larger than the box process : @xmath59 , we shall neglect the latter in considering the sm background . ]",
    "there are two contributing subprocesses : @xmath60 \\ ; , \\label{qq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath61 where the factor @xmath37 is given in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) , and the @xmath62 is the scattering angle in the center - of - mass frame and @xmath63 is from @xmath64 to 1 . in @xmath65 , the effect of graviton exchanges",
    "first occurs in the interference term , which only scales as @xmath66 , and potentially more important than the square term of @xmath67 at @xmath68 .",
    "both cdf and d0 @xcite have preliminary data on diphoton production .",
    "we are going to use their data to constrain @xmath5 .",
    "cdf has measured the invariant mass @xmath69 spectrum in the region 50 gev @xmath70 350 gev . however , since the data is only preliminary and in graphical form only , we can only use the reported number of events in the region @xmath71 gev : 5 events are observed where @xmath72 are expected with an integrated luminosity of 100 pb@xmath52 .",
    "this data , though without binning information , is sufficient to place a constraint on @xmath5 , because the signal for the low - scale gravity does not appear as a peak in the @xmath69 spectrum but , instead , a gradual enhancement from about @xmath73 gev towards higher @xmath69 .",
    "we use the poisson statistics to calculate the 95% cl upper limit to the number of _ signal _ events @xmath74 , or less with 95% confidence . ]",
    "using @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the expected number of background events and @xmath77 is the number of observed events .",
    "we obtain @xmath78 .",
    "we then normalized our calculation to the expected number of events ( = 4.5 ) after imposing the same selection cuts as cdf . with this normalization",
    "we can then calculate @xmath5 , which gives a signal of 6.61 events in excess of the sm prediction .",
    "we obtain the 95% cl lower limit on @xmath5 : @xmath79 for d0 , however , the highest bin in the measured @xmath69 spectrum is 80112 gev . at such a low value ,",
    "it is difficult to see the effect of @xmath80 .",
    "thus , we expect the limit that would be obtained from the d0 data is somewhat smaller than using the cdf data .",
    "next , we estimate the sensitivity reach at the run ii of the tevatron , assuming a luminosity of 2 fb@xmath52 .",
    "the effect of the low scale gravity on the @xmath69 spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - te ] .",
    "it is easy to understand why the enhancement is more likely at the large @xmath69 . to estimate the sensitivity we divide the @xmath69 spectrum into bins : a bin width of 100 gev for bins in @xmath81 gev , and for 500 gev to 1000 gev we combine it into one bin only",
    "this is to make sure that each bin should have at least a few events in the sm : see the first row of table [ table - te ] ( we also use a selection efficiency of 50% . ) for each bin we assume the sm prediction as the number of events that would be observed : @xmath82 , and we calculate the number of events predicted by a @xmath5 and @xmath47 : @xmath83 .",
    "we then calculate the @xmath84 for this bin and sum over all bins , using @xmath85\\;.\\ ] ] the @xmath84 then gives a goodness of the fit for the value of @xmath5 and @xmath47 .",
    "the larger the @xmath84 the smaller the probability that the corresponding value of @xmath5 and @xmath47 is a true representation for the data . to place a 95%cl lower limit on @xmath5 a @xmath86",
    "is needed for 4 degrees of freedom .",
    "the number of events in each bin for @xmath10 and @xmath87 tev , and for @xmath88 and @xmath89 tev with the corresponding @xmath84 are shown in table [ table - te ] .",
    "we obtain a limit of @xmath90 we verified that the binning is not important for the limit .",
    "we repeat the procedures using only one large bin from 200 to 1000 gev , and the 95% cl lower limit on @xmath5 becomes 1.73 ( 1.38 ) tev for @xmath91 .    .",
    "[ table - te ] the number of events that would be observed in each bin of @xmath69 for the sm and for the low scale gravity at the tevatron with @xmath92 tev and a luminosity of 2 fb@xmath52 .",

    "the cuts imposed are : @xmath93 , @xmath94 gev , and a selection efficiency of 0.5 is assumed . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "diphoton production at @xmath0 , @xmath95 , and @xmath2 colliders provides useful channels to search for the presence of the low scale gravity interactions , which are the effects of allowing gravity to propagate in the extra dimensions .",
    "photon - photon colliders are able to give the best sensitivity reach on the cut - off scale @xmath5 of the low scale gravity model among the three .",
    "this is because @xmath96 can only occur via box diagrams in the sm while in @xmath2 and @xmath95 collisions the tree - level contributions from the sm dominates .",
    "in addition to the total cross section , the angular distribution also serves as a tool to distinguish between the sm and the new gravity interactions , as seen in fig .",

    "[ fig - ee](b ) .",
    "the present limit from the lepii diphoton data is about @xmath97 tev for @xmath91 , and it is only @xmath98 tev from the cdf diphoton @xmath69 data . the sensitivity reach in @xmath0 collisions is about 58 times of @xmath99 while it is only 3.55.5 times of the @xmath43 at @xmath2 collisions . at the run ii of the tevatron ,",
    "the reach is only about 1.7 ( 1.4 ) tev for @xmath91 .",
