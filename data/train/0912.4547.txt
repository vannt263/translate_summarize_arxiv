    "we have witnessed tremendous advances in our ability to measure galaxy properties with unprecedented accuracy over the past two decades .",
    "the greatest leap forward was the advent of the ccd , with an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity over photographic film and the ability to easily make quantitative measurements . today , surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) provide access to high quality data covering a large wavelength range , probing different astrophysical aspects of the galaxies .",
    "these advances have been immediately applied to examining the global properties of galaxies .",
    "understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies requires probing them over a long time ( redshift ) baseline to establish the physical processes responsible for their current observed properties .",
    "it is far easier to measure nearby etgs as opposed to their counterparts at high redshift , and this must be borne in mind when comparing samples at opposite distance extremes .",
    "almost as soon as high quality data became available for nearby samples of etgs it was recognized that they occupy a 2-dimensional space , the fundamental plane ( fp ) , represented by the quantities radius , velocity dispersion , and surface brightness r - @xmath3 - @xmath4 .",
    "brosche ( 1973 ) was the first to examine etgs using multi - variate statistical techniques , applying principal component analysis ( pca ) to the relatively poor data available .",
    "although his results were not fully appreciated at the time , it drew the attention of other researchers who further studied the implications of the fp ( djorgovski 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "brosche s fundamental contribution was to show that we should be looking for sets of data with the smallest number of significant principal components when starting from a large number of input parameters . in this way we reduce a high - dimensional dataset to only those quantities that are likely to have physical meaning .",
    "several studies followed brosche s : @xcite , efstathiou & fall  ( 1984 ) , whitmore  ( 1984 ) , and okamura et al .",
    "( 1984 ) .",
    "the fundamental plane is a bivariate scaling law between r , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 , where @xmath4 = -2.5 log @xmath5 , expressed as r @xmath6 . in order to obtain accurate and meaningful coefficients that can be compared to theoretical expectations ( such as those from the virial theorem , which implies a = 2 and",
    "b= -1 ) we need to not only have a homogeneous sample of etgs , but also to understand the selection effects in defining the sample and to properly measure the photometric and spectroscopic quantities involved .",
    "several contributions in the past have met most of these requirements  @xcite . however , the lack of homogeneous data covering a large wavelength baseline while also probing the entire range of environments ( local galaxy density ) impeded further progress .",

    "another important and often overlooked aspect of such studies is the impact of different techniques and implementations for measuring r - @xmath3 - @xmath4 and their respective errors , which ultimately will be propagated and compared to the distribution of residuals around the fp  @xcite .",
    "this is the first paper of a series presenting the spheroid s panchromatic investigation in different environmental regions ( spider ) survey .",
    "spider utilizes optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry in the @xmath1 wavebands as well as spectroscopic data .",
    "spectroscopy and optical photometry are taken from sdss dr6 , while the @xmath7 data are obtained from the ukidss - las dr4 . in the present work ( paper i ) , we describe how the sample of etgs is selected , how the photometric and spectroscopic parameters are derived for each galaxy , and derive an accurate estimate of the completeness of the sample in each band .",

    "we present a detailed comparison of the 2dphot output quantities ( magnitudes and structural parameters ) to those provided by the sdss photo pipeline  @xcite .",
    "we have also re - computed central velocity dispersions from the sdss spectra using the software starlight  @xcite , and compared these new estimates to those from sdss .",
    "velocity dispersions are re - derived using a combination of simple stellar population models as templates .",
    "this procedure minimizes the well known template mismatch problem , accounting for the different kinematics of various stellar components in a galaxy .",

    "the sensitivities to age and metallicities , indicated as @xmath139 and @xmath140 , are defined as the derivatives of the color indices with respect to @xmath141 and @xmath142 , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the age and metallicity , respectively .",
    "the derivatives are estimated as in  @xcite .",
    "we use an ssp from the @xcite synthesis code , with solar metallicity , scalo imf , and an age of @xmath145  gyr , corresponding to a formation redshift of @xmath146 in the adopted cosmology . for the sdss wavebands ,",
    "the sensitivities reach a minimum in @xmath147 , while they have a maximum in @xmath148 , as expected by the fact that this color encompasses the @xmath149 break in the spectrum of etgs at the median redshift of the spider sample ( @xmath150 ) .",

    "[ tab : dcoldzdt ] , one can see that the corresponding scatter in the @xmath155 internal color gradients would be only @xmath156mag .",
    "following  @xcite , for a de vaucouleurs profile , this implies an intrinsic scatter in the difference of r- and i - band effective radii of only @xmath157 , hence much smaller than the typical measurement error on @xmath126 ( see below ) . for the ukidss wavebands ,",

    "the data presented in this paper represents the most extensive ever obtained for early - type galaxies .",
    "optical data from sdss were entirely reprocessed ; images with 2dphot ( la barbera et al .",
    "2008 ) and spectra with starlight , as described above .",
    "this allows us to perform a proper comparison of different pipelines .",
    "we have created a database to store all of the photometric and spectroscopic parameters measured as part of our reprocessing .",
    "the spider database ( sdb ) currently contains only the photometric ( sdss and ukidss ) and spectroscopic ( sdss ) data described here , but we expect to incorporate additional data from other wavelength regimes .",
    "the sdb architecture is extensible and designed to support this growing process .",
    "we are currently developing an intuitive graphic user interface ( gui ) which will allow the user to easily retrieve all information available in the sdb issuing sql queries . until the gui is ready for general use",

    "the data presented here will be used in the forthcoming papers analyzing the fp relations ( papers ii and iii ) .",
    "given the importance of obtaining meaningful measurements of the structural parameters entering the fp , this contribution examines how consistent these parameters are and their errors . here",
    "we summarize the main properties of the sample defined in this paper and the characteristic parameters of each etg :    1 - when matching optical@xmath66nir data we end - up with 5,080 etgs which can then be used to study the global properties of elliptical galaxies in the nearby universe ( z@xmath1590.1 ) .    2 - for each of these etgs we have measured aperture and total magnitudes , k - corrected and dereddened for galactic extinction .",
    "we also quantify for each galaxy the following essential parameters : effective ( half - light ) radius , @xmath160 , the mean surface brightness within this radius , @xmath161 , the sersic index ( shape parameter ) @xmath162 , the axis ratio @xmath109 , and the position angle of the major axis , @xmath110 .",
    "besides , the galaxy isophotal shape is characterized by the a@xmath163 parameter .    3 - uncertainties in all of the parameters previously listed are estimated and presented as a function of the logarithm of the signal - to - noise per pixel .",
    "median errors in @xmath160 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 are @xmath166 , @xmath167  @xmath168 , and @xmath169 , respectively , in the optical , and @xmath170 , @xmath171  @xmath168 , and @xmath172 in the nir .    4 - we do not find any systematic steepening of the cm relation when considering a waveband baseline from @xmath148 to @xmath173 , as expected if the _",
    "cm relation is solely driven by a mass  metallicity relation in etgs . according to scodeggio ( 2001 ) , this result can be interpreted as follows : etgs have negative color gradients , with color indices becoming bluer from the galaxy center to its outskirts .",
    "thus , when we adopt colors in a fixed aperture , we measure a color inside a smaller region ( with respect to @xmath174 ) for the brightest ( hence larger ) galaxies than for faintest galaxies in the sample , leading to a misleading steepening of the cm relation    5 - the study presented here of the structural parameters of etgs reveals the following properties : log @xmath175 decreases by 35% from the optical to the nir , reflecting the internal color gradients in these systems ; the axis ratios , b / a , have their distribution essentially constant from @xmath8 through k , with a media value of @xmath720.7 and width of @xmath720.2 ; the sersic index is always larger than 1 , since we selected only bulge dominated galaxies and spans a domain from @xmath722 to @xmath7210 , with a median of 6 for all wavebands ; no systematic trend of a@xmath163 was found from @xmath8 to @xmath138 .",
    "6 - we present measurements of central velocity dispersion obtained using starlight .",
    "extensive comparison with the estimates provided by the sdss pipeline , shows that our estimates are unbiased over the whole @xmath176 range , with a median error of @xmath7215% .",
    "7 - comparison of two independent pipelines was done ( sdss and 2dphot ) and reveals significant differences in magnitude and effective radius with respect to the sersic index and absolute model magnitude in r - band .",
