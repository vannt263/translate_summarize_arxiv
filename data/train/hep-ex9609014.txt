    "since quantum chromodynamics @xcite and the concept of asymptotic freedom @xcite were introduced to describe the dynamics of hadronic processes at high momentum transfers , several key \" predictions of the theory were successfully tested by experiment : ` evidence for jet structure in hadron production by @xmath1 annihilation ' was found in 1975 @xcite , the gluon was explicitly observed at the petra @xmath1 storage ring in 1979 @xcite .",
    "the first measurement of the coupling strength @xmath0 , the basic free parameter of the theory , was reported in that same year @xcite , based on leading order perturbative qcd .",
    "the first determination of @xmath0 in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd dates back to 1982 @xcite .",
    "after these pioneering years , many further tests of qcd were performed in @xmath1 annihilation , in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering and at hadron colliders . in 1988",
    ", first evidence for the running @xmath0 was obtained from the energy dependence of 3-jet event production rates in @xmath1 annihilation @xcite . an update and a summary of these measurements",
    "will be presented in section  3 of this review .",
    "although many determinations of @xmath0 , in the energy range of @xmath9  to  @xmath10  gev , were available by 1990 , the @xmath11 of @xmath0 could not convincingly be seen from those results @xcite . only in 1992 , a compilation of measurements of @xmath0 in the energy range from 1.78  gev ( the mass of the @xmath5-lepton ) to 91.2  gev ( the mass of the @xmath12-boson ) , could demonstrate the characteristic energy dependence of the strong coupling @xcite .",
    "the actual evidence for the running coupling strength or , equivalently , for asymptotic freedom is summarised in this review .",
    "the results from jet production rates in @xmath1 annihilation are presented in section  3 .",
    "recent studies of jet production and of the proton structure function @xmath13 in deep inelastic electron - proton collisions are discussed in section  4 .",
    "new results from jets in @xmath14 collisions and from hadronic decays of @xmath5-leptons , demonstrating the energy dependence of @xmath0 in ranges of very high and very low momentum transfers , respectively , are presented in sections  5 and  6 .",
    "an update of the world summary of @xmath0 measurements is finally given in section  7 .",
    "this report is restricted to results which were published at the time of this conference ; preliminary results are not taken into account .",
    "within perturbative qcd , the energy dependence of @xmath0 is given by the @xmath15-function : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of quark flavours with masses less than the energy scale @xmath18 .",

    "more detailed information about the basic qcd equations and for the treatment of heavy quark flavour thresholds can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "studies of hadron jets provide the most intuitive tests of the underlying parton ( i.e. quark and gluon ) structure of hadronic events .",
    "the most commonly used algorithm to reconstruct jets in @xmath1 annihilation was introduced by the jade collaboration @xcite : the scaled pair mass of any two resolvable jets @xmath21 and @xmath22 in a hadronic event , @xmath23 , is required to exceed a threshold value @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total visible ( measured ) energy of the event . in a recursive process",

    "the energy dependence of @xmath32 is only determined by the running @xmath0 ; the scale factor @xmath46 - although it s optimal value is not given by the theory - is not expected to change with energy .",
    "jet production rates are therefore an ideal tool to test the energy dependence of @xmath0 , without the need to actually determine @xmath0 itself .",
    "the first analysis in this sense was done by jade @xcite .",
    "the original jade ( also called @xmath47 ) scheme with @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the energies of the particles and @xmath51 is the angle between them , has the smallest hadronisation corrections with only a weak dependence on the centre of mass energy , @xmath31 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  1 , where the ratio @xmath30 = @xmath32(hadrons ) / @xmath32(partons ) predicted by the jetset qcd shower model @xcite is plotted as a function of @xmath31 , for constant values of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "for all jet algorithms , the quantity ( 1@xmath30 ) shows an approximate 1/@xmath52 behaviour at large @xmath52 , as expected for non - perturbative hadronisation effects . at smaller energies , usually for @xmath53 gev",
    ", @xmath30 increases with decreasing @xmath52 because of misassignments of jets , caused by hadronisation fluctuations and heavy quark decays .",
    "for the jade e0 algorithm , @xmath54 is small enough and the energy dependence of @xmath30 is sufficiently flat for @xmath52 between 25 and 200 gev to be approximated by a constant within a systematic uncertainty of @xmath55 .",

    "the significance of data from future high energy @xmath1 linear colliders can be inferred from figure  3 : at @xmath74  gev , the statistical error @xmath75 for 1000 hadronic events will be about 1% .",
    "from the point of view of the previous experiments at petra and pep and with the eyes of qcd , i.e. on a logarithmic energy scale , a linear collider at @xmath76  gev is almost half - way to infinte energies !",

    "the observation was made that measurements which are obtained at energy scales of 5  gev  @xmath111  20  gev are systematically low , corresponding to @xmath112 , while at @xmath113 and @xmath114  gev the results tend to be higher , @xmath115 and 0.122 , respectively .",
    "speculations about the origin of these differences include the existence of a light , neutral , coloured object of spin 1/2 ( e.g. a gluino ) , a possible dependence on the scattering process ( @xmath1 annihilation or deep inelastic scattering ) or effects of quark masses which are not included in the current higher order qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "in general , these systematic but hardly conclusive differences are still visible in this summary , see table  1 and figure  8 . however , the most recent results of @xmath0 from deep inelastic scattering at hera and from jet production in hadron collisions underline the tendency towards higher values of @xmath91 , in agreement with those from @xmath1 annihilation , and the detailed studies of hadronic @xmath5-decays provide consistent results , too",
    ". therefore the hyptheses of a process dependence of @xmath0 or of the existence of light gluinos are not very likely to explain the suspected differences . the most probable origin of those ,",
    "if significant at all , could be the absence of heavy quark mass effects in the current qcd calculations , which would affect the results from data with energies close to the quark thresholds most .",
    "next - to - leading order calculations including quark mass effects are currently being worked on .",
    "this , together with the ongoing efforts to determine @xmath0 from the yet increasing amount of data from various processes , has the potential to decrease systematic uncertainties and to resolve the cause of the differences which are still being observed .",
    "asymptotic freedom , which is @xmath116 key feature of the theory of strong interactions , has been successfully tested in various experimental studies .",
    "perhaps the most intuitive and direct method , the study of the energy dependence of 3-jet event production rates in @xmath1 annihilation , @xmath32 , began to provide evidence for the running of @xmath0 already in 1988 .",
    "these studies , carried out by various experiments in a large range of c.m .",
    "energies , are based on the jade - e0 jet algorithm for which , at constant jet resolution , hadronisation corrections are small enough such that @xmath32 is directly proportional to @xmath0 . with the availability of the lep data the evidence developed into a proof of asymptotic freedom , demonstrating that @xmath0 decreases with increasing energy , as predicted by qcd .",
    "further significant tests became available in the past two years : jet rates in ep - collisions at hera and 1-jet inclusive transverse energy distributions in hadron collisions , measured by single experiments in large regions of the energy scale , provide the possibility to determine the energy dependence of @xmath0 while minimising systematic point - to - point uncertainties .",
    "a new analysis based on invariant mass distributions of hadronic @xmath5-decays demonstrates the running of @xmath0 in the energy range of @xmath117 , where the coupling changes by almost a factor of two .",
    "in addition to these dedicated tests , the world summary of measurements of @xmath0 , in the energy range of @xmath118  gev , provides compelling evidence for asymptotic freedom . within their assigned uncertainties ,",
    "all measurements are compatible with the qcd expectation of a running @xmath0 .",
    "extrapolated to a common energy scale , using equations 1  and  2 and treating quark flavour thresholds as described in @xcite , the measurements of @xmath0 average to @xmath119 the overall uncertainty of 0.006 corresponds to a simple estimate of a 90% confidence level \" , derived from the scatter of the individual results .",
