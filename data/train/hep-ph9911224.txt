    ".1 cm    undoubtedly the solar  @xcite and atmospheric  @xcite neutrino problems provide the two most important milestones in the search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . of particular importance",
    "has been the recent confirmation by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite of the zenith - angle - dependent deficit of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "altogether solar and atmospheric data give a strong evidence for and conversions , respectively .",
    "neutrino conversions are a natural consequence of theories beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the first example is oscillations of small - mass neutrinos .",
    "the simplest way to account for the lightness of neutrinos is in the context of majorana neutrinos : their mass violates lepton number .",
    "its most obvious consequences would be processes such as neutrino - less double beta decay  @xcite , or cp violation properties of neutrinos  @xcite , so far unobserved .",
    "neutrino masses could be hierarchical , with the light much heavier than the and .",
    "while solar neutrino rates favour the small mixing angle ( sma ) msw solution , present data on the recoil - electron spectrum prefer the large mixing msw  @xcite ( lma ) solution  @xcite . when interpreted in terms of neutrino oscillations",
    ", the observed atmospheric neutrino zenith - angle - dependent deficit clearly indicates that the mixing involved is maximal . in short",
    "we have the intriguing possibility that , unlike the case of quarks , neutrino mixing is bi - maximal .",
    "supersymmetry with broken r ",
    "parity provides an attractive origin for bi - maximal neutrino oscillations , which can be tested not only at the upcoming long - baseline or neutrino factory experiments but also at high  energy collider experiments such as the lhc .",
    "one should however bear in mind that there is a variety of alternative solutions to the neutrino anomalies .",
    "just as an example let me stress the case for lepton flavour violating neutrino transitions , which can arise without neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "they may still fit present solar  @xcite and contained atmospheric  @xcite data pretty well .",
    "they may arise in models with extra heavy leptons @xcite and in supergravity theories  @xcite",
    ". a possible signature of theories leading to fc interactions would be the existence of sizeable flavour non - conservation effects , such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 conversion in nuclei , unaccompanied by neutrino - less double beta decay if neutrinos are massless .",
    "in contrast to the intimate relationship between the latter and the non - zero majorana mass of neutrinos due to the black - box theorem  @xcite there is no fundamental link between lepton flavour violation and neutrino mass .",
    "other possibilities involve neutrino decays  @xcite and transition magnetic moments  @xcite coupled to either to regular  @xcite or to random magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the solar and atmospheric neutrino data from underground experiments there is also some indication for neutrino oscillations from the lsnd experiment  @xcite . barring exotic neutrino conversion mechanisms",
    "one requires _",
    "three mass scales _ in order to reconcile all of these hints , hence the need for a light sterile neutrino  @xcite .",
    "out of the four neutrinos , two of them lie at the solar neutrino scale and the other two maximally - mixed neutrinos are at the hdm / lsnd scale .",
    "the prototype models proposed in  @xcite enlarge the 1 higgs sector in such a way that neutrinos acquire mass radiatively , without unification nor seesaw .",
    "the lsnd scale arises at one - loop , while the solar and atmospheric scales come in at the two - loop level , thus accounting for the hierarchy .",
    "the lightness of the sterile neutrino , the nearly maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing , and the generation of the solar and atmospheric neutrino scales all result naturally from the assumed lepton - number symmetry and its breaking .",
    "either - conversions explain the solar data with - oscillations accounting for the atmospheric deficit  @xcite , or else the rles of and are reversed  @xcite .",
    "these two basic schemes have distinct implications at future solar & atmospheric neutrino experiments with good sensitivity to neutral current neutrino interactions .",
    "cosmology can also place restrictions on these four - neutrino schemes  @xcite .",

    "the best - fit @xmath9be neutrino flux is negative !",
    "the theoretical predictions clearly lie well away from the @xmath10 contour , strongly suggesting the need for new particle physics in order to account for the data  @xcite .",
    "since possible non - standard astrophysical solutions are rather constrained by helioseismology studies @xcite one is led to assume the existence of neutrino conversions , such as those induced by very small neutrino masses .",
    "possibilities include the msw effect  @xcite , vacuum neutrino oscillations @xcite and , possibly , flavour changing neutrino interactions @xcite . moreover , if neutrinos have transition magnetic moments then one may have , in addition , the possibility of majorana neutrino spin - flavour precessions @xcite . based upon these",
    "there emerge two new solutions to the solar neutrino problem : the resonant  @xcite and the aperiodic spin - flavour precession mechanisms @xcite , based on regular and random magnetic fields , respectively .    the recent 825day data sample  @xcite presents no major surprises , except that the recoil energy spectrum produced by solar neutrino interactions shows more events in the highest bins .",
    "barring the possibly of poorly understood energy resolution effects , it has been noted  @xcite that if the flux for neutrinos coming from the @xmath11 , the so - called @xmath12 reaction , is well above the ( uncertain ) ssm predictions , then this could significantly influence the electron energy spectrum produced by solar neutrino interactions in the high recoil region , with hardly any effect at lower energies .",

    "one notices from the analysis that rate - independent observables , such as the electron recoil energy spectrum and the day - night asymmetry ( zenith angle distribution ) , are playing an increasing rle in the determination of solar neutrino parameters  @xcite .",
    "an observable which has been neglected in most analyses of the msw effect and which could be sizeable in the large mixing angle regions ( lma and low ) is the seasonal dependence in the solar neutrino flux which would result from the regeneration effect at the earth and which has been discussed in ref .",

    "an important assumption in the analysis is that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 cm is the mean free path of the electrons in the solar medium .",

    ".1 cm    neutrinos produced as decay products in hadronic showers from cosmic ray collisions with nuclei in the upper atmosphere have been observed in several experiments @xcite .",
    "there has been a long - standing discrepancy between the predicted and measured @xmath24 ratio of the muon ( @xmath25 ) over the electron atmospheric neutrino flux ( @xmath26 )  @xcite .",
    "the anomaly has been found both in water cerenkov experiments ( kamiokande , super - kamiokande and imb ) as well as in the iron calorimeter soudan2 experiment .",
    "negative experiments , such as frejus and nusex have much larger errors .",

    "the matter enhancement occurs only for _ anti - neutrinos _ , suppressing the conversion in @xmath27 s .",
    "since the yield of atmospheric neutrinos is bigger than that of anti - neutrinos , clearly the matter effect suppresses the overall conversion probability .",

    "this trend can indeed be seen by comparing the regions in different columns of fig .",

    "notice that in all channels where matter effects play a rle the range of acceptable @xmath15 is slightly shifted towards larger values , as compared with the @xmath34 case .",
    "this follows from the relation between mixing _ in vacuo _ and in matter .",
    "in fact , away from the resonance region , independently of the sign of the matter potential , there is a suppression of the mixing inside the earth . as a result ,",
    "the lower allowed @xmath15 value is higher than for the @xmath34 channel .    concerning the quality of the fits we note that the best - fit to the full sample is obtained for the @xmath34 channel , although from the global analysis oscillations into sterile neutrinos",
    "can not be ruled out .",
    "there is also an improvement in the quality of the fits to the contained events as compared to previous analysis performed with lower statistics @xcite .",
    "these features can be easily understood by looking at the predicted zenith angle distribution of the different event types for the various oscillation channels shown in fig .",

    "for example , an mev range tau neutrino may provide a viable unstable dark matter scenario @xcite if the decays before the matter dominance epoch .",
    "its decay products would add energy to the radiation , thereby delaying the time at which the matter and radiation contributions to the energy density of the universe become equal .",

    ".1 cm    one of the most challenging problems in modern astrophysics is to find a consistent explanation for the high velocity of pulsars .",
    "observations @xcite show that these velocities range from zero up to 900 km / s with a mean value of @xmath57 km / s .",
    "an attractive possibility is that pulsar motion arises from an asymmetric neutrino emission during the supernova explosion .",
    "in fact , neutrinos carry more than @xmath58 of the new - born proto - neutron star s gravitational binding energy so that even a @xmath59 asymmetry in the neutrino emission could generate the observed pulsar velocities .",
    "this could in principle arise from the interplay between the parity violation present in weak interactions with the strong magnetic fields which are expected during a sn explosion  @xcite . however , it has recently been noted  @xcite that no asymmetry in neutrino emission can be generated in thermal equilibrium , even in the presence of parity violation .",
    "this suggests that an alternative mechanism is at work .",
    "several neutrino conversion mechanisms in matter have been invoked as a possible engine for powering pulsar motion .",
    "they all rely on the _ polarization _ @xcite of the sn medium induced by the strong magnetic fields @xmath60 gauss present during a sn explosion .",
    "this would affect neutrino propagation properties giving rise to an angular dependence of the matter - induced neutrino potentials .",
    "this would lead in turn to a deformation of the `` neutrino - sphere '' for , say , tau neutrinos and thus to an anisotropic neutrino emission . as a consequence , in the presence of non - vanishing @xmath61 mass and mixing the resonance sphere for the @xmath62 conversions is distorted .",
    "if the resonance surface lies between the @xmath61 and @xmath28 neutrino spheres , such a distortion would induce a temperature anisotropy in the flux of the escaping tau - neutrinos produced by the conversions , hence a recoil kick of the proto - neutron star .",
    "this mechanism was realized in ref .",
    "@xcite invoking msw conversions @xcite with @xmath63 100 ev or so , assuming a negligible @xmath28 mass .",
    "this is necessary in order for the resonance surface to be located between the two neutrino - spheres .",
    "it should be noted , however , that such requirement is at odds with cosmological bounds on neutrinos masses unless the @xmath64-neutrino is unstable . on the other hand in ref .",
    "@xcite a realization was proposed in the resonant spin - flavour precession scheme ( rsfp ) @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field would not only affect the medium properties , but would also induce the spin - flavour precession through its coupling to the neutrino transition magnetic moment @xcite .    perhaps the simplest and probably most elegant suggestion was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the required pulsar velocities would arise from anisotropic neutrino emission induced by resonant conversions of massless neutrinos ( hence no magnetic moment ) .",
    "raffelt and janka  @xcite have subsequently argued that the asymmetric neutrino emission effect was overestimated in  @xcite , since the temperature variation over the deformed neutrino - sphere is not an adequate measure for the anisotropy of the neutrino emission .",
    "this would invalidate all neutrino conversion mechanisms , leaving the pulsar velocity problem without any viable solution .",
    "however kusenko and segr still maintain that sizeable pulsar kicks can arise from neutrino conversions @xcite . in any case",
    "invoking conversions into sterile neutrinos could be an interesting possibility , since the conversions could take place deeper in the star @xcite .",
    ".1 cm    physics beyond the standard model is required in order to explain solar and atmospheric neutrino data . while neutrino oscillations provide an excellent fit and a powerful way to determine neutrino mass and mixing",
    ", there is a plethora of alternative mechanisms , some of which quite attractive , which could play an important rle in the interpretation of the data .",
    "these include flavour changing neutrino interactions both in the solar @xcite and atmospheric  @xcite neutrino problems , resonant  @xcite and the aperiodic spin - flavour precession mechanisms @xcite for solar neutrinos , which use the transition magnetic moments of majorana neutrinos @xcite , and the possibility of fast neutrino decays  @xcite which could play a rle in the atmospheric neutrino problem  @xcite .",
    "moreover i note that more exotic explanations of the undergound neutrino data based upon violations of equivalence principle , lorentz invariance and cpt have been proposed  @xcite .",

    ".1 cm    these data can be accounted for with the three known neutrinos .",
    "they fix the two mass splittings @xmath0 & @xmath65 , and two of the three neutrino mixing angles , the third being small on account of the chooz reactor results  @xcite .",
    "such scenario can easily be accommodated in _ seesaw _ theories of neutrino mass since , in general , the mixing angles involved are not predicted , in particular the maximal mixing indicated by the atmospheric data and possibly also by the solar data can be accomodated by hand .",
    "in contrast , it is not easy to reconcile maximal or _ bi - maximal _ mixing of neutrinos  @xcite with a predictive quark - lepton _ unification seesaw _ scheme that relates lepton and quark mixing angles , since the latter are known to be small . for attempts to reconcile solar and atmospheric data in unified models with specific texture anzatze ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an alternative way to predict a hierarchical pattern of neutrino mass and mixing , which naturally accomodates the possibility of maximal mixing is to appeal to supersymmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the simplest unified extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with bi - linear r  parity violation provides a predictive scheme for neutrino masses which can account for the observed atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies in terms of bi - maximal neutrino mixing .",
    "the maximality of the atmospheric mixing angle arises dynamically , by minimizing the scalar potential of the theory , while the solar neutrino problem can be accounted for either by large or by small mixing oscillations .",
    "the spectrum is naturally hierarchical , since only the tau neutrino picks up mass at the tree level ( though this may be itself calculable from renormalization - group evolution from unification down to weak - sacle ) , by mixing with neutralinos , while the masslessness of the other two neutrinos is lifted only by calculable loop corrections . despite the smallness of neutrino masses r - parity violation",

    "bi - maximal models may also be tested at the upcoming long - baseline experiments or at a possible neutrino factory experiment  @xcite through the cp violating phases , which could lead to non - negligible cp asymmetries in neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the effects of the cp violation intrinsic of the majorana neutrino system  @xcite is helicity suppressed  @xcite , though a potential test of the cp properties and majorana nature of neutrinos has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .      .1 cm    the story gets more complicated if one wishes to account also for the hot dark matter .",
    "the only possibility to fit the solar , atmospheric and hdm scales in a world with just the three known neutrinos is if all of them have nearly the same mass @xcite , of about @xmath66 1.5 ev or so in order to provide the right amount of hdm @xcite ( all three active neutrinos contribute to hdm ) .",
    "this can be arranged in a unified 0 seesaw model where , to first approximation all neutrinos lie at the above hdm mass scale ( @xmath66 1.5 ev ) , due to a suitable horizontal symmetry , the splittings @xmath0 & @xmath65 appearing as symmetry breaking effects . an interesting fact",

    "for example , it has been argued that present observations of primordial helium and deuterium abundances may allow up to @xmath80 neutrino species if the baryon to photon ratio is small  @xcite . adopting this as a limit , clearly both models described above are consistent .",
    "should the bbn constraints get tighter @xcite e.g. @xmath81 they could rule out the @xmath71 model , and leave out only the competing scheme as a viable alternative .",
    "however the possible rle of a primordial lepton asymmetry might invalidate this conclusion , for recent work on this see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the neutral - to - charged current ratios are important observables in neutrino oscillation phenomenology , especially sensitive to the existence of singlet neutrinos , light or heavy @xcite . on this basis the two models above",
    "would be distinguishable at future neutral - current - sensitive solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "for example they may be tested in the sno experiment  @xcite once they measure the solar neutrino flux ( @xmath82 ) in their neutral current data and compare it with the corresponding cc value ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "if the solar neutrinos convert to active neutrinos , as in the @xmath71 model , then one expects @xmath84 around 0.5 , whereas in the @xmath72 scheme ( conversion to ) , the above ratio would be nearly @xmath85 . looking at pion production via the neutral current reaction @xmath86 in the atmospheric data might also help in distinguishing between these two possibilities  @xcite , since this reaction is absent in the case of sterile neutrinos , but would exist in the @xmath72 scheme .",
    "if light sterile neutrinos indeed exist one can show that they might contribute to a cosmic hot dark matter component and to an increased radiation content at the epoch of matter - radiation equality .",
    "these effects leave their imprint in sky maps of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and may thus be detectable with the very high precision measurements expected at the upcoming map and planck missions as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".1 cm    finally , the door is not closed to heavy neutrinos .",
    "indeed , an alternative to the inclusion of hot dark matter is to simulate its effects through the late decay of an mev tau neutrino  @xcite , in the presence of a light sterile neutrino .",
    "indeed such a model was presented @xcite where an unstable mev majorana tau neutrino naturally reconciles the cosmological observations of large and small - scale density fluctuations with the cold dark matter picture .",
    "the model assumes the spontaneous violation of a global lepton number symmetry at the weak scale .",
    "the breaking of this symmetry generates the cosmologically required decay of the with lifetime @xmath87 sec , as well as the masses and oscillations of the three light , and @xmath76 which may account for the present solar and atmospheric data , though a dedicated three - neutrino fit in which one of the neutrinos is sterile would be desirable .",
    ".1 cm    the angle - dependent atmospheric neutrino deficit provides , together with the solar neutrino data , a strong evidence for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "small neutrino masses provide the simplest , but not unique , explanation of the data . allowing for alternative explanations of the underground experiments involving non - standard",
    "neutrinos opens new possibilities involving either massless or even very heavy cosmologically unstable neutrinos , which naturally arise in many models . from this point of view , it is still too early to infer with great certainty neutrino masses and angles from underground experiments alone . keeping within the framework of the standard neutrino oscillation interpretation of the data , one has an interesting possibility of bi - maximal neutrino mixing and of testing the neutrino anomalies not only at the upcoming long - baseline or neutrino factory experiments , but also at high  energy accelerators . on the other hand",
    "if the lsnd result stands the test of time , this would be a strong indication for the existence of a light sterile neutrino .",
    "the two most attractive ways to reconcile underground observations with lsnd invoke either - conversions to explain the solar data , with - oscillations accounting for the atmospheric deficit , or the opposite . at the moment",
    "the latter is favored by the atmospheric data .",
    "these two basic schemes have distinct implications at future neutral - current - sensitive solar & atmospheric neutrino experiments , such as sno and super - kamiokande .",
    "to end up on a phylosophical mood i would say that it is important to search for manifestations of massive and/or non - standard neutrinos at the laboratory in an unbiased way .",
    "though most of the recent excitement now comes from underground experiments , one should bear in mind that models of neutrino mass may lead to a plethora of new signatures which may be accessible also at high  energy accelerators , thus illustrating the complementarity between the two approaches .",
    "i am grateful to the organizers for the kind hospitality and to all my collaborators , especially concha gonzalez - garcia and her student carlos pea for the re - analysis of solar neutrino data .",
