    "in recent years considerable attention has been paid to controllable josephson junctions . in general , such a josephson junction consists of a superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( sns ) junction with additional electrodes connected to the normal region of thew junction . inside the normal region coherent quantum states are formed due to the presence of the two superconducting electrodes .",
    "the properties of the junction , and in particular the critical current @xmath4 are determined by the energy spectrum _ and _ the occupation of these states .",
    "hence it is possible to change @xmath4 by changing the energy distribution of the quasiparticles in the junction normal region @xcite .",
    "this is done by sending a control current through the additional electrodes connected to the normal region or by applying a control voltage @xmath1 over them .",
    "several experiments have been performed the past years on these devices , which differ mainly in the way in which the energy of the quasiparticles is changed @xcite .",
    "the most interesting situation is that of the so called controllable @xmath0-junctions @xcite . in these systems",
    "it is not only possible to change the magnitude of the critical current of the junction but also to reverse its direction with respect to the phase difference @xmath5 between the two superconducting electrodes .",
    "this sign reversal is equivalent to the introduction of an extra phase factor @xmath0 in the josephson supercurrent ( @xmath6)-phase relation @xmath7 this means that for zero supercurrent , the ground state is that of a macroscopic phase difference equal to @xmath0 .",
    "there is an analogy here with @xmath0-junctions associated with bi - crystals @xcite or s - d contacts in ceramic superconductors @xcite and @xmath0-junctions using a dilute ferromagnet f as the `` normal '' region of a s - f-s junction @xcite .",
    "however , the ceramic systems remain a @xmath0-junction ( or normal junction ) once fabricated and the s - f-s junctions switch between a normal and a @xmath0-state only as a function of temperature .",
    "this in contrast with the controllable @xmath0-junction where the state of the junction as well as the magnitude of the critical current is fully controllable by means of the control voltage . +   + using such controllable @xmath0-junctions as weak links of a dc squid ( direct current superconducting quantum interference device ) , it is possible to tune the critical currents of the individual weak links .",
    "more interestingly , it is possible to add an extra phase of @xmath0 or 2@xmath0 to the squid loop without the application of an external magnetic field by switching one or two of the junctions in a @xmath0 state .",
    "an extra phase factor of @xmath0 is identical to the external application of half a flux quantum , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 wb .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the condition of a single - valued wave function around the squid loop , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total flux in the ring , n is an integer and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the phases over the two josephson junctions , as shown in fig.[squidschema]a .",
    "switching one junction in the @xmath0-state at an external flux @xmath14 adds @xmath0 to the left hand side of eq.[squideq ] .",
    "this leads to the same solution of the equation if the junction would be in the `` conventional '' state with an external flux @xmath15 .",
    "hence it is possible to generate a screening current in a squid with a sufficintly large inductance in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "+   + the main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate unequivocally that it is possible to add a macroscopic quantum phase of @xmath0 or 2@xmath0 to a dc squid with 2 controllable @xmath0-junctions as weak links .",
    "we demonstrate that this results in a screening current that can be switched on or off depending on @xmath1 at an external flux of an integer flux quantum .",
    "+   + the outline is the following : we begin , in section ii , with a very short description of the basics of the dc squid and a description of the theoretical concepts regarding controllable @xmath0-junctions . in section",
    "iii we discuss the sample design and fabrication and in section iv we discuss experiments on single controllable @xmath0-junctions made of nb - ag or nb - cu .",
    "the geometry of these devices differs from the conventional cross shape .",
    "we show that the nb - ag device shows a 0 to @xmath0 transition at 1.4 k , in contrast with the nb - cu device .",
    "the full dependence of the critical currents of both devices on @xmath1 is in good quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions discussed in section ii . in section",
    "v we proceed with measurements on a controllable squid , made of ag - nb .",
    "we show that the magnitude and sign of the voltage oscillations of the squid as a function of the magnetic field under suitable current bias can be tuned . in the last section we measure directly the flux expelled by the screening current in a controllable squid by placing a smaller squid directly behind it .",
    "we show that the screening current around integer external flux can be switched on or off by switching one of the junctions of the controllable squid in a @xmath0- or a normal state .",
    "before we discuss the controllable @xmath0-junction it may be helpful to discuss the basics of the dc squid@xcite .",
    "a dc squid is a ring of superconducting material with self inductance l and two josephson junctions with a critical currents @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the absence of any external flux , @xmath18 ,",
    "the squid is in equilibrium and behaves as a single josephson junction with a total critical current @xmath4= @xmath16+@xmath17 . if @xmath19 , then the total flux @xmath11 in the squid loop changes , depending on its self inductance , according to @xmath20 with @xmath21 the screening current running around the squid loop .",
    "the flux in the loop , @xmath11 , also depends on the phases of the two josephson junctions @xmath22 which is directly obtained from eq.[squideq ] . in the limit of small self inductance , so that the @xmath23 term in eq.[fluxeq ] is negligible and if @xmath24 , it is easy to show that @xmath25 where we use eqs.[josephson],[fluxeq ] and [ phaseeq ] . in this case",
    "@xmath4 is periodic in @xmath26 and varies between @xmath27 at @xmath28 and 0 at @xmath29 . at nonzero inductance",
    "the periodicity remains the same but the amplitude of the @xmath4 modulation is reduced , for @xmath4=0 is not reached at @xmath30 due to the presence of the circulating current @xmath21 . in the limit of large self inductance , the amplitude of the @xmath4 modulation decreases to @xmath31 , whereas @xmath21 becomes a saw tooth function varying linearly from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , as shown in fig.[squidschema](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the periodic behavior of @xmath4 as function of @xmath18 can be transformed into a periodic voltage by sending a bias current @xmath34 a little larger than the maximum value of @xmath4 through the squid . due to the non - linear i -",
    "v curve of the squid the difference in @xmath35 translates into a voltage @xmath36 , thus creating a very sensitive flux to voltage transformer .",
    "the resulting @xmath3 oscillations are shown in fig.[squidschema](d ) .",
    "a controllable @xmath0-junctions is a device that combines two different structures in one : a thin film sns junction and a short mesoscopic wire ( which we call control channel ) between two large electron reservoirs in thermal equilibrium .",
    "a schematic drawing is given in fig.[schema ] : the center of the control channel , which connects two large reservoirs , is coupled to the normal region of a co - planar thin film sns junction , in which the normal region partly overlaps the superconducting electrodes .",
    "the length and width of the normal region are denoted by l and w in the figure .",
    "the size of the junction @xmath37 and the control channel length , @xmath38 , is larger than the elastic mean free path of the electrons , which is approximately given by the film thickness ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "hence the electron motion is diffusive .",
    "+   +    the principle of operation is the following : the presence of the two superconducting electrodes induces a continuous spectrum of supercurrent carrying states @xmath40 in the normal region of the junction , which is responsible for the supercurrent transport ( @xmath41 in fig.[schema ] ) .",
    "the energy scale @xmath42 is the energy with respect to the fermi level .",
    "as stated before , the critical value of @xmath41 , @xmath4 , is determined by the energy spectrum _ and _ the occupation of these supercurrent carrying states .",
    "the occupation of the states is determined by the energy distribution of the quasiparticles in the normal region of the junction , @xmath43 , which is identical to the energy distribution in the center of the control channel .",
    "this energy distribution can be modified by means of applying a voltage @xmath1 over the control channel , so @xmath44 .",
    "the relation between @xmath4 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 is given by @xcite : @xmath47im(j(e,\\varphi=\\pi/2 ) ) \\medspace , \\label{icrn}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 the phase difference between the superconducting electrodes @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that the critical current is modified by changing the energy of the quasiparticles in the normal region and not by the flow of the control current associated with @xmath1 . in the present geometry",
    "this is quite clear , because the current paths of @xmath41 and the control current are separated .",
    "this is in contrast with the conventional cross geometry , where @xmath41 crosses the control current . however , even in this case it is the energy of the quasiparticles and not the control current that determines the critical current .    to calculate the dependence of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath1 we need to know both the shape of the supercurrent carrying density of states , @xmath40 and the shape of the quasiparticle energy distribution in the normal region of the junction , @xmath48",
    "the exact energy dependence of @xmath40 is calculated using the quasi - classical green s function theory @xcite .",
    "it depends on the ratio of the thouless energy with the energy gap @xmath49 of the superconductors .",
    "the thouless energy is given by @xmath50 , with l the length of the normal region of the sns junction@xcite and d the diffusion constant of the normal metal .",
    "the general shape of @xmath40 , as shown by the solid black line in both panels of fig .",
    "[ scdos ] is a strongly damped oscillation with a hard gap at low energies @xmath51 .",
    "the positive and negative parts of the supercurrent carrying density of states represent energy dependent contributions to the supercurrent in the positive and negative direction .",
    "the other relevant quantity of the system is the quasiparticle energy distribution , @xmath46 .",
    "the exact shape of @xmath46 in the center of the control channel ( and hence in the junction normal region ) depends , as shown by pothier _",
    "@xcite , on the voltage @xmath1 applied over the control channel and on the amount of electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering . at low temperatures , @xmath52 ,",
    "electron - electron scattering is the dominant relaxation mechanism and the electron energy distribution depends only on @xmath1 and the electron - electron interaction . in this case , we can distinguish two limiting possibilities : +   + _ 1 : no electron - electron interaction _ if the control channel is sufficiently short , so that the electron - electron interaction time @xmath53 exceeds the diffusion time @xmath54 through the channel , the electrons conserve their energy .",
    "the resulting electron energy distribution in the center of the wire is given by@xcite @xmath55 \\quad , \\label{step}\\ ] ] here @xmath56 is the fermi - dirac distribution at a temperature t @xmath57^{-1 } \\quad , \\label{fd}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 boltzmann s constant .",
    "eq.[step ] is the renormalized addition of the thermal distribution functions of the reservoirs with an energy separation of @xmath59 .",
    "this represents , if @xmath60 , a double step structure with an occupation fraction of @xmath61 in an energy range of @xmath59 around the fermi energy .",
    "such a step distribution will , at a large enough value of @xmath1 , block all the positive contributions of @xmath40 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ scdos]b , because an occupation fraction of @xmath61 causes the integrand of eq.[icrn ] to vanish .",
    "this results in a reversal in the direction of the supercurrent and hence the transition to a @xmath0-state +   + _ 2 : very strong electron - electron interaction _ if the control channel is very long , so that @xmath62 , the electron system regains a _ local _ thermal equilibrium .",
    "the energy distribution given by the fermi - dirac distribution , with an effective temperature @xmath63 , @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the bath temperature and @xmath66 can be calculated using the wiedemann - franz law , resulting in @xmath66=3.2 k / mv .",
    "this situation is called the hot electron limit. the result , a fermi - dirac distribution with a width increasing with @xmath1 , causes a rapid decay of the supercurrent , as shown in the left panel of fig.[scdos]a due to the compensation of the positive and negative contributions in @xmath40 .",
    "+   + the shape of the distribution function in a real experiment is in general in between these two limits , with possible modifications due to electron - phonon interactions . we calculate the exact shape of the energy distribution function using a model presented by pothier _ _ et al.__@xcite . in this model",
    "the shape of the electron energy distribution in the wire depends on four parameters : the voltage @xmath1 applied over the wire , the effective strength of the electron - electron interaction , the effective strength of the electron phonon interaction and possible heating of the reservoirs .",
    "the electron - electron interaction is described by a two - particle interaction with an interaction kernel @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 is the energy transferred between two interacting particles and @xmath54 the diffusion time through the wire . the magnitude @xmath69 and energy dependence @xmath70 of the electron - electron interaction",
    "can be calculated by means of a direct calculation of the screened coulomb interaction in a homogenous 1-dimensional diffusive conductor @xcite . without going into detail",
    "it is important to realize that a direct measurement of the electron energy distribution function in diffusive 1d gold , copper and silver wires using tunnel junction spectroscopy @xcite yields material dependent results for @xmath71 which are not consistent with the theoretical predictions using refs.@xcite alone .",
    "because the control channels used in our experiment are similar to the wires measured in refs.@xcite , we have used the experimental values of @xmath70 in our calculations : @xmath72 for copper and @xmath73 for ag .",
    "the strength of the interaction , @xmath69 is used as a fit parameter .    in the model , the effect of electron - phonon scattering is implemented in a similar way .",
    "the magnitude of the interaction kernel is , in this case , deduced from measurements of the phase relaxation time@xcite , and given by @xmath74 for cu and ag .    as a last input parameter , possible heating of the reservoirs",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "the power associated with the application of the control voltage , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is the control channel resistance ) is injected into the reservoirs . at low bath temperatures ( t @xmath77 1k ) , low values of @xmath76 and large values of @xmath78 , the electron gas in the reservoirs",
    "can attain a much higher effective temperature than the bath temperature@xcite .",
    "however , all experiments presented in the remainder of the text are performed at relatively high temperatures of 1.4 k , resulting in negligible heating of the reservoirs @xcite .",
    "so far , all experimental evidence of a controllable @xmath0-junction @xcite has been achieved using devices with a cross geometry .",
    "the control channel and the normal region of the junction are in fact a single cross shaped metallic wire , with superconducting contacts at the first two opposite ends and large reservoirs at the others .",
    "this geometry is not suitable for use in a squid geometry , because one of the reservoirs of each junction would have to be within the squid loop , which is not possible due to the large reservoir sizes needed .",
    "therefore we use a device geometry with side contacts ( see fig.[jie ] ) , such as used by morpurgo _ _ et al.__@xcite in the thermal limit .",
    "the disadvantage of this geometry is that it imposes a larger minimum length on the control channel than the conventional cross geometry , where this length can be reduced to about 1 @xmath79 m . as a consequence , a material with a slow electron - electron relaxation",
    "is needed to be able to maintain a non - thermal energy distribution in the control channel . for this reason gold is unsuitable as the normal metal@xcite and copper or preferably silver should be used .",
    "we now describe the sample fabrication , referring to fig .",
    "the samples have been realized on a thermally oxidized si wafer that is covered with a 150 nm layer of sputter deposited @xmath80 to improve the adhesion of ag and cu . in the first step 50 nm of nb",
    "is deposited using standard e - beam lithography , dc sputtering and subsequent lift - off .",
    "the critical temperature of the sputtered film is 8.1 k. subsequently the normal region , control channel and the reservoirs ( ag or cu ) are deposited using shadow evaporation without breaking the vacuum .",
    "this is needed because the adhesion of these metals is poor , implying that it is not possible to bake a deposited film to be able to do another lithography step .",
    "we use a double layer of pmma - ma and pmma with e - beam lithography and wet etching to create a pmma suspended mask .",
    "the deposition of the metals is done in an uhv deposition system with a background pressure of @xmath81 mbar , the pressure in the system during the evaporation steps is @xmath82 mbar .",
    "prior to deposition we use argon etching ( @xmath83 mbar , 500 v ) for 3.5 minutes to clean the nb surface .",
    "subsequently we deposit , in the case of an ag sample , 10 nm of ti adhesion layer under a large angle ( @xmath84 , resulting in a shift to the left in the figure ) , with the result that the ti layer is only deposited on the substrate at the position of the reservoirs and not at the position of the thin openings defining the control channel and the normal region of the junction .",
    "this is important , for the effect of a thin ti layer upon the electron - electron interaction time is not known",
    ". then we deposit 50 nm ag perpendicular to the substrate , thus creating the control channel and the normal region of the junction . as a last step 700 nm of ag",
    "is deposited again at @xmath84 to form the reservoirs with an effective thickness of 475 nm . in fig.[jie ] the left shift due to the large evaporation angle of the reservoirs with respect to the control channel is clearly visible .",
    "a ( parasitic ) projection of the control channel and the normal region of the sns junction is not present , because the aspect ratio of the top resist is so large for these structures that the metal is deposited into the side wall of the resist .",
    "this results in a removal of these projections during lift - off .",
    "the fabrication of the cu samples is identical except for the fact that cu is used for the normal conducting regions of the device and that no ti adhesion layer is used underneath the reservoirs .",
    "we found that this is not necessary for sufficient adhesion .",
    "the length of the control channel can not be made shorter , because the resist will become unstable if the large openings defining the reservoirs come any closer @xcite . to measure the quality of the niobium - normal metal interface we have made , in every fabrication run , a cross of a 200 nm wide nb and normal metal wire .",
    "the resistance of the 200x200 nm interface has been determined to be @xmath85 0.1 @xmath86 each time , which is smaller than the square resistance of the normal metal ( 0.4 @xmath86 ) , indicating that the interface is clean .",
    ".[tab : tablejies ] parameters of the single sns junctions .",
    "@xmath87 is the normal state resistance of the sns junction , l is the length of the normal region and w the width ( see fig.[schema ] ) .",
    "@xmath88 is the thouless energy obtained using d and l. [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the critical currents of the bottom and top junctions , @xmath17 and @xmath16 respectively , are measured by applying precisely the critical control voltage to one junction ( reducing its critical current to 0 ) and measure the transport critical current through the squid . from these values",
    "we can estimate l=65 ph .",
    "this value of l would result in a maximum expelled flux at 1.4 k , if no control voltages are applied to the junctions , of 0.34 @xmath26 associated with @xmath89 .    in the experiment we measure the @xmath3 oscillations of the _ measurement _ squid using a suitable low frequency ac bias current .",
    "this is done for different values of @xmath90 on the _ controllable _ squid .",
    "a representative result is shown in fig .",
    "the grey line indicates the situation where @xmath91 . in this case @xmath92=0 .",
    "the result is an ( almost ) sinusodal voltage with a period of 0.134 mt , which represents @xmath26 for the small measurement squid .",
    "the black line shows the situation where @xmath93=0.62 mv . in this case",
    "periodic deviations from the grey line are observed associated with the screening current in controllable squid .",
    "the periodicity of the deviations is given by @xmath94 = 0.029 mt .",
    "the ratio @xmath95 which is the ratio of the areas of the two squids .",
    "it is this difference in area and hence in periodicity , that makes it possible to obtain information over the circulating current in the large controllable squid over several fluxquanta within less than half a fluxquantum in the measurement squid . to make the result more clear we can extract the magnetic field induced in the measurement squid by the screening current in the controllable squid from this data : we subtract the grey curve from the black one , and multiply this difference by @xmath96 , which is obtained by numerically differentiating the grey curve .",
    "obviously the data around @xmath97 ... @xmath26 are not obtainable because the sensitivity of the measurement squid is zero at these points .",
    "we perform this analysis on a set of data at different values of @xmath98 .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[sawtooth ] for 2 different values of @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "we observe that the black line , which is the same measurement as shown in fig .",
    "[ mori](@xmath99=0.62 mv ) , is a saw tooth function around integer flux , consistent with the behavior of the screening current in a squid with a relatively large self inductance , as shown in fig.[squidschema]c .",
    "the grey line , for which @xmath99=1.08 mv , shows the exact same behavior , with however a shift of half a fux quantum . in this case a screening current flows , in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction , at integer external flux .",
    "these measurements indicate that it is possible , around an integer flux quantum , to switch between a conventional state without a screening current and a state with a ( bistable ) screening current by applying @xmath100 .",
    "this is illustrated more clearly by the data in fig.[circel ] . in this figure",
    "we show a measurement of the magnetic field induced in the bottom squid as a function of the @xmath90 ( in stead of @xmath18 ) for two different values of the applied external flux around -1 fluxquantum . at @xmath93",
    "the field induced in the measurement squid is a horizontal line close to 0 , indicating that hardly any flux is expelled from the controllable squid .",
    "hence no screening current flows around the loop of the controllable squid as expected .",
    "however , if @xmath99 we see an increase ( or decrease ) of the induced magnetic field , associated with the screening current caused by the introduction of an extra phase factor of @xmath0 ( -@xmath0 ) in the squid loop .",
    "the sign of the signal depends on the exact value of the external flux . at @xmath101 ( black line ) ,",
    "the induced field is negative , consistent with fig.[sawtooth ] .",
    "this clearly indicates that it is possible to switch from a state with no current running around the squid loop to a non zero current state .",
    "the small a - symmetries in the figure are caused by the magnetic field associated with the current flowing in the control channel of the bottom junction .",
    "we have demonstrated that in a controllable @xmath0-squid a screening current can be generated without the application of an external magnetic field by putting one controllable @xmath0-junction of the squid into a @xmath0-state . at a measurement temperature of 1.4 k and with the present geometry , only a nb - ag controllable @xmath0 junction shows the transition to a @xmath0 state , in contrast with a nb - cu device .",
    "we have shown that this difference is caused by the difference in electron - electron interaction strength between ag and cu , consistent with direct measurements of this quantity on similar diffusive wires using tunnel junction spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the possibility of adding an extra phase of @xmath0 to the squid loop is demonstrated not only by the screening current , but also by the fact that the @xmath3 oscillations can be shifted by a phase factor of @xmath0 or 2@xmath0 , depending wether one or two controllable junctions are put on a @xmath0-state .",
