    "electronic and transport properties of carbon nanotubes are highly topical subjects in mesoscopic physics ( see for a review @xcite ) due to potential technological applications in nano - electronics and optical devices @xcite . among various studies of physical properties of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) ,",
    "a detailed understanding of spin - orbit interaction is crucial for the interpretation of ongoing experiments as well as for future applications of the nanotubes in spintronics .    in general , the intrinsic ( intraatomic ) spin - orbit interaction in graphene",
    "is weak @xcite , since carbon atoms have zero nuclear spins , and the hyperfine interaction of electron spins with nuclear spins is suppressed .",
    "it makes a spin decoherence in such material to be weak as well , i.e. , scattering due to disorder is supposed to be not important .",
    "a full analysis of a spin - orbit interaction in cnts requires , however , to consider the isospin degree of freedom present in the honeycomb carbon lattice .",
    "according to a general wisdom , graphene being a zero - gap semiconductor has a band structure described by a linear dispersion relation at low energy , similar to massless dirac - weyl fermions @xcite . for a cnt",
    "the quantization condition leads , however , to metallic or semiconducting behavior , depending on chirality @xcite",
    ". the curved geometry may give rise to a band gap even for metallic cnts @xcite .",
    "such a gap would allow to confine electrons , otherwise not possible due to the klein paradox @xcite . however , a precise form of a spin - orbit interaction in a single - layer graphene nanotube is still not well known .",
    "a consistent approach to introduce the curvature - induced spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the low - energy physics of graphene have been developed by ando @xcite and by others @xcite .",
    "recent measurements in ultra clean cnts @xcite , at various values of the magnetic field , revealed the energy splitting which can be associated with a spin - orbit coupling .",
    "indeed , the measured shifts are compatible with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "however , some features are left debatable .",
    "evidently , removing the degeneracy between quantum levels , the magnetic field generates new mechanisms as well , which obscure effects related to a plain spin - orbit coupling ( see , for example , discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "it is noteworthy on the pivotal fact that within the approach developed by ando @xcite one obtains two soc terms : one preserves the spin symmetry in the rotating frame ( see below ) , while the second one breaks this symmetry . in previous studies @xcite",
    "the role played by the second term was underestimated .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , to consider consistently a full curvature - induced spin - orbit coupling in an armchair nanotube within the approach suggested by ando @xcite .",
    "second , to show that the second term could play an important role in transport phenomena . in order to illuminate the role of interplay between both terms on electron transport",
    ", we analyze the situation at zero magnetic field , removing all additional mechanisms related to the magnetic field .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , we also provide analytical estimations for the energy spectrum and transport coefficients for different cases ( with and without the second term ) .",
    "evidently , the analytical approach gives a fundamental insight into the nature of electronic and transport properties of cnts .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive an explicit formula for eigen spectrum of the ando hamiltonian with a full curvature - induced spin - orbit coupling in an armchair nanotube . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss different symmetries associated with the hamiltonian and analyze the current operators .",
    "iv is devoted to the analysis of scattering phenomena at the interface introduced by a potential step and to transport properties of carbon quantum dots at the preserved spin symmetry . in sec .",
    "v , with the aid of results of sec .",
    "iv , we discuss transport effects produced by a full curvature - induced spin - orbit coupling in armchair nanotubes .",
    "main conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "appendix provides technical details used for analytical solutions .",
    "figure [ fig_tube ] sketches a carbon nanotube and a coordinate system with respect to the orientation axis of a carbon nanotube in our analysis .",
    "the orbitals corresponding to the @xmath0 bands of graphene are made by linear combinations of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xmath3 atomic orbitals , whereas the orbitals of the @xmath4 band are @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "starting from the tight - binding model , with the aid of @xmath6 scheme in the vicinity of the fermi energy ( @xmath7 ) at @xmath8 and @xmath9 points of the first brillouin zone , ando has derived the effective mass hamiltonian for electrons on curved surface with spin - orbit interaction ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "we follow this approach and use the effective mass hamiltonian as a starting point of our analysis .",
    "this hamiltonian can be expressed in the form of matrix - hamiltonian equation @xmath10 with the following definitions @xmath11 here , @xmath12 are standard pauli matrices , and the spinors of two sub - lattices are @xmath13 we preserve the definitions introduced by ando @xcite for the following parameters : @xmath14 here , the quantities @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the transfer integrals for @xmath0 and @xmath4 orbitals , respectively in a flat 2d graphene , and @xmath17 is a lattice constant ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the intrinsic source of the soc @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the atomic potential .",
    "the energy @xmath23 is the energy of @xmath0-orbitals which are localized between carbon atoms .",

    "[ fig_e ]    ando suggested to neglect a spin - orbit term proportional to @xmath28 , i.e. , the term @xmath29 in the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "he assumed that a spin projection on the cnt symmetry axis ( y - axis ) is a conserved integral of motion .",
    "based on the perturbative approach result , he concluded that a spin mixing in the wave function due to this term is very small .",
    "ando admitted , however , that it may couple states from bands with different spin quantum numbers and lead to a small spin relaxation .",
    "although in ref.@xcite a different basis was used to derive the effective hamiltonian for a single wall cnt , the term breaking its spin symmetry ( a conservation of @xmath30-component ) was obtained as well .",
    "similar to ref.@xcite , it was also suggested in ref.@xcite to neglect such a term .",
    "in contrast , we consider all spin - orbit terms on equal footing , since even a small perturbation brought about by the second term breaks the fundamental spin symmetry of the total hamiltonian . in this case",
    "all three spin projections are not conserved in any system .",
    "different bands must be distinguished by the magnetic quantum number @xmath31 which is a projection of the total angular momentum on the symmetry axis of the cnt ( see below ) . as a result ,",
    "this preserved fundamental symmetry allows to couple states with different spins even inside one band .",
    "we restrict our consideration by an armchair nanotube . in this case",
    "the soc does not lead to the additional effect such as an electron - hole asymmetry @xcite .",
    "to get rid of the @xmath32 dependence in the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) , we apply the transformation @xmath33 with the aid of the unitary operator @xmath34 @xmath35 as a result , we obtain the hamiltonian in the transformed frame @xmath36 where @xmath37 is @xmath38 unity matrix , and @xmath39 we distinguish in the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) the kinetic @xmath40 and the potential @xmath41 terms . here",
    ", the operators @xmath42 are the pauli matrices which act on the wave functions of a- and b - sub - lattices ( a pseudo - spin space ) .",
    "note that the kinetic term couples the wave functions of a- and b - sub - lattices as well as the potential term .    in our consideration ,",
    "the curvature - induced spin - orbit coupling is described by two terms : @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the term @xmath43 depends on : i)values of the transfer integral @xmath16 for @xmath4 orbitals ; and ii)combined action produced by a product of the _ intrinsic _ spin - orbit interaction and the difference between the transfer integrals @xmath16 , @xmath15 for @xmath4 and @xmath0 orbitals , respectively , in a flat 2d graphene .",
    "the term @xmath44 depends on the difference between the transfer integrals @xmath16 , @xmath15 for @xmath4 and @xmath0 orbitals , respectively , in a flat 2d graphene .",
    "the both terms are inversely proportional to the tube radius , and tend to zero at @xmath45 , i.e. , in the limit of a flat graphene . for small nanotubes ( small radius ) we might expect , however , that effects produced by these terms come into particular prominence in transport phenomena .    herewith , for the sake of convenience , we use @xmath46 , if otherwise it will be not mentioned . at @xmath47 ,",
    "the spin projection @xmath48 is a constant of motion , since it commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath49=0 $ ] .",
    "the term @xmath50 breaks this symmetry and yields a spin mixing .",

    "the energy spectrum for a typical cnt as a function of the continuous variable @xmath58 and the quantized projection of the angular momentum @xmath31 is shown on fig.2 .",
    "for the sake of illustrations , in numerical calculations we use the following parameters @xcite : @xmath67ev , @xmath68ev , @xmath69 , the bond length @xmath70 1.42 . for a given @xmath31-value",
    "the fermi energy @xmath71 provides four possible values for @xmath58 : @xmath72 .",
    "the energy gap @xmath73 in the cnt is defined by a minimal distance between negative and positive parts of the spectrum ( see eqs.([epm_av ] ) ) @xmath74 at @xmath47 there is a minimal gap @xmath75 , which coincides with the value obtained by ando @xcite . at @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78",
    "the minimal gap becomes even lesser , while for @xmath79 it increases .",
    "thus , the comparison of the gap ( [ gap ] ) with experimental data would allow to fix the model parameters ( [ ggp ] ) .",
    "the transport does not persist in the gap , since all eigen modes are evanescent ones .",
    "evidently , when the spin - orbit interaction ( @xmath80 ) is zero , one is faced with a plain metallic cnt .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) has several symmetries .",
    "there is a particle - hole symmetry @xmath81 defined by the operator @xmath82 therefore , energies for the eigenfunctions @xmath55 and @xmath83 are equal in value but opposite in sign .",
    "there are two inversion operators @xmath84 , @xmath85 , for @xmath32 , @xmath86 coordinates , respectively , @xmath87 with properties @xmath88 these transformations connect the eigenfunctions with opposite quantum numbers @xmath58 and @xmath31 .",

    "to understand how the full soc affects the system properties , we consider first only @xmath103 , @xmath47 . as discussed above , in this case",
    "the operator @xmath104 is an integral of motion .",
    "therefore , we transform our hamiltonian to the frame where the operator @xmath105 has a diagonal form @xmath106 here , the transformation @xmath107 , defined as @xmath108 consists of a rotation on angle @xmath109 around @xmath110-axis and the permutation @xmath111 .",
    "this permutation collects spin up components of the a- and b - sub - lattices in the upper part of the spinor @xmath55 . in virtue of this transformation ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hp ] ) gains a block - diagonal structure    @xmath112    one obtains obvious four eigenvalues and eigenvectors @xmath113      we consider first the scattering at the interface introduced by a potential step of the height @xmath114 as sketched in fig.[fig_trans ] . on the one hand , the step is assumed to be smooth on the length scale of a graphene unit cell ( an inverse brillouin momentum @xmath115 ) .",
    "therefore , it does not induce the intervalley ( @xmath116 ) scattering . on the other hand",
    ", it is assumed to be sharp on the fermi length scale ( @xmath117 ) .",

    "we denote particle by symbol `` p '' , while a hole by a symbol `` h '' . for the sake of illustration , p - p and p - h transmissions are schematically shown on fig.[fig_trans ] .",
    "transmission ( reflection ) of electrons incoming from the left is controlled by partial coefficients .",
    "namely , we have @xmath119 describing transmission ( reflection ) probability from the left states with a set of quantum numbers @xmath120 to the right states with @xmath121 . transmission ( reflection )",
    "probabilities are defined as squares of the scattering - wave - function amplitudes which satisfy the continuity of wave functions . evidently , since spin is a good quantum number as well as a quantum number @xmath31 , the transmission ( reflection ) probabilities , responsible for the spin - flip process , are absent at @xmath47 : @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "[ fig_exp ]    matching the eigenfunctions with the same values of the angular momentum and spin projections on the left and right sides of the potential step , we obtain the following equation @xmath124 } { \\sqrt{|\\gamma{\\mathrm{i}}(z_q^*-z_q)| } } = \\frac{t_q^q}{\\sqrt{|\\gamma{\\mathrm{i}}({\\tilde z}_q^*-{\\tilde z}_q)| } } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c }   1 \\\\ { \\tilde z}_q \\end{array } \\right).\\ ] ] here @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) are defined by eq.([zm ] ) , @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) are complex conjugate , and the energy @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) before ( after ) the step .",
    "the wave functions are normalized to have a unit current flow along the @xmath86-axis .",
    "the solution of eq.([matchs_l0 ] ) defines the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath131    in order to reveal the effect of the soc let us consider the case of quantum numbers @xmath132 .",
    "it corresponds to a normal incident direction of electrons on the potential step for the cnt without the soc and @xmath80 .",
    "note that the variable @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) ( see eq.([zm ] ) ) depends on the term @xmath135 . in our case",

    "the taylor series expansion of the reflection @xmath138 ( see eq.([rt_l0 ] ) ) over this parameter @xmath137 enables to us to define the first nonzero term ( omitting unimportant phase factor ) @xmath139 the estimation ( [ rnn_l0 ] ) describes remarkably well numerical results for the scattering until @xmath71 or @xmath118 is close to the gap ( see fig.4a ) .",
    "thus , at @xmath140 and @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is of order @xmath143ev for the typical parameters of cnts , there is a weak backward scattering defined by eq .",

    "let us assume that there is a magnetic field along the symmetry axis @xmath86 .",
    "it results in the aharonov - bohm magnetic flux passing through the cnt cross section , which yields the modified quantum number @xmath146 ( @xmath147  magnetic flux , @xmath148  magnetic flux quanta ) .",
    "evidently , with the aid of the magnetic field along the symmetry axis y one can suppress the orbital current for any value of the quantum number @xmath31 ( without the zeeman splitting ) .",
    "taking into account eqs.([lxy ] ) , ( [ abbrev ] ) , ( [ jt_l0 ] ) , we obtain the condition for a zero orbital current for a magnetic quantum number @xmath31 @xmath149 in particular , for the set of quantum numbers @xmath150 we obtain @xmath151 at the magnetic flux @xmath152 which compensates the soc term @xmath43 at @xmath153 .",
    "note that at the condition ( [ cmf ] ) ( and @xmath47 ) the gap ( [ gap ] ) vanishes as well for any @xmath31 .    thus , the soc works as an `` effective magnetic field '' , responsible for the orbital motion and , therefore , for the weak backward scattering ( [ rnn_l0 ] ) . in the absence of zeeman splitting the applied magnetic field @xmath152 leads to zero backward scattering in all orders .",
    "the gap in cnts ( due to the soc ) opens a possibility to create a nanotube quantum dot ( qd ) , by confining particles in a quantum well with a potential @xmath154 ( where @xmath155 is a heaviside step functions ) , as illustrated in fig.[fig_qdtube ] .",
    "we recall that in the gap there are evanescent modes only .",

    "its boundaries are shown on fig .",

    "in particular , a crossing / anti - crossing behavior of two levels depends on their symmetry with respect to the inversion of the @xmath86-axis ( see fig.[qds ] ) .",
    "two levels with the same parity @xmath224 ( when @xmath225 ) anti - cross , while a different sign @xmath226 leads to the level crossing .",
    "other properties of discrete levels are very similar to properties of those obtained at @xmath47 .",
    "within the approach suggested by ando ( see details in @xcite ) , we solved analytically the eigenvalue problem for the effective mass hamiltonian for electrons on curved surface with the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "in particular , with the aid of transformation ( [ u ] ) , we obtained explicit expressions for a low energy spectrum and eigenstates of armchair carbon nanotubes .",
    "these findings have been used to analyze transport properties of the cnt with the curvature - induced soc ( see eq.([lxy ] ) ) at different limits .",
    "we have studied effects produced by the soc on the scattering of electrons at the interface introduced by the potential step of height @xmath114 .",
    "the effect of the soc becomes especially drastic when the height of the potential barrier can be controlled to reach conditions allowing to produce a spin - filter effect . at this condition",
    "only one spin component is dominant in the transmission over the cnt .",
    "note that this phenomenon occurs due to the `` effective magnetic field '' which is brought about by the curvature induced soc .",
    "the soc term @xmath44 yields , however , a parasite loss @xmath227 of the spin - filter effect .",
    "the gap in cnts ( due to the soc ) opens a possibility to create a nanotube quantum dot . in the limit of the preserved spin symmetry",
    "we have calculated the qd eigenstates with aid of the transcendental equation . at low energy limit",
    "the spectrum is similar to the one of the quantum well potential , while for large energies it carries features of the harmonic oscillator spectrum . in such qds",
    "an electron with spin up can not scatter into state with spin down and vise versa , without any additional mechanism .",
    "however , the soc term @xmath44 mixes these states and yields the anti - crossing effect",
    ". this mechanism may affect the spin relaxation phenomenon in the system under consideration , in addition to an electron - phonon coupling mechanism @xcite .",
    "there was a belief that the curvature induced soc in graphene , restricted by the first term , leads only to very weak back scattering @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated , however , that the second term , ignored in a previous analysis , produces the inter - channel scattering , which could increase the back scattering by a few orders of magnitude and enrich transport phenomena in carbon nanotubes .",

    "we suggest to use the eigenstate in the form @xmath229 to solve the eigenvalue problem @xmath230 for the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) . as a result ,",
