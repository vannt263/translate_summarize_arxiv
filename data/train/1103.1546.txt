    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle sets the limit on how small the fluctuations of these quadratures can be : @xmath5 .",
    "the case when @xmath6 is called the standard quantum limit ( sql ) , or shot - noise limit .",
    "coherent states ( typically generated by lasers ) and the vacuum are well known examples of field states were the sql is achieved .",
    "there is currently much effort to reduce the measurement noise below this limit with so called `` squeezed '' states of light , where the quantum fluctuations of one of the quadratures is reduced to below the sql  @xcite .",
    "the applications of squeezed states extend well beyond precision measurements ; they were recently studied as a carrier and probe for a quantum memory based on atomic ensembles  @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties for these studies is the lack of a strong squeezing source at atomic transition frequencies .",
    "while nonlinear crystal based squeezers can generate an impressive 11  db of squeezing at 1064  nm  @xcite , they fail to deliver high amounts of squeezing at shorter wavelengths , since the crystal windows of transparency lie at higher wavelengths .",
    "so far , the record value of squeezing at 795  nm is 5  db  @xcite .",
    "an alternative way of generating squeezed states based on the polarization self - rotation ( psr ) effect  @xcite was suggested in  @xcite .",
    "psr is a nonlinear optical effect observed when elliptically polarized light , with wavelength tuned near an atomic transition , experiences a rotation of its polarization ellipse while propagating through an atomic medium .",
    "since the intensity of the left and right circular polarization components are different in elliptically polarized light , this leads to unequal ac - stark shifts and optical pumping of the different atomic zeeman sublevels resulting in circular birefringence .",
    "phase differences in the propagation of the two circular components of the light result in the polarization ellipse rotation  @xcite . unlike the faraday effect ,",
    "psr is observed at zero magnetic field .",
    "several research groups  @xcite have explored the generation of squeezing using the psr effect in hot rb vapor . in all of these cases , the amount of squeezing was about 1  db below the sql , which is smaller than the original prediction of matsko in  @xcite .",
    "this is attributed to excess atomic noise and an inefficient light - atom interaction due to doppler broadening in the hot rb vapor samples used in the experiments .",
    "several groups have suggested that in a cold atomic cloud , the psr effect will yield higher squeezing through the reduced thermal motion of the interacting atoms  @xcite .",
    "our group has recently reported the study of the psr effect in a cold @xmath0rb cloud held in a magneto - optical trap ( mot )  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on our theoretical and experimental studies of the light quantum noise modification under conditions of psr in an ultracold @xmath0rb cloud . in the following sections , we first review our theoretical approach , and some results .",
    "this is followed by description of the experimental apparatus and details pertinent to the measurements . after presentation and discussion of the results , we close with a summary and brief perspective on application of the psr effect in an ultracold gas to generate squeezed states of light .",
    "according to the original psr squeezing theory  @xcite , linearly polarized light slightly detuned from a transition resonance of an atom generates squeezed vacuum in the polarization orthogonal to that of the incident light as it propagates through the atomic medium .",
    "the amount of squeezing is expected to increase in proportion to the psr effect .",
    "however , it was quickly understood that the original treatment , based on the nonlinear susceptibility of the atomic medium , is too simplistic since it does not account for the excess noise introduced by the atoms .",
    "although atomic absorption , which degrades the squeezing , was phenomenologically taken into account , sources of excess noise , such as amplified spontaneous emission , were not considered  @xcite . however , excess noise is present in all experimental observation of psr squeezing  @xcite . under some experimental conditions , it dominates the light fluctuations and observation of squeezing becomes impossible  @xcite .    to properly describe the light fluctuations after interaction with the atomic sample ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the atomic operators need to be incorporated into the treatment .",
    "this can be achieved via the heisenberg - langevin equations that incorporates the atomic fluctuations through the use of stochastic forces .",
    "such an approach for the description of psr vacuum squeezing was first attempted in @xcite on a model four - level scheme and in @xcite for a two level system including the complete zeeman degeneracy .",
    "the first successful numerical modeling of an experimental observation of psr squeezing was reported in @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that the complete excited state hyperfine structure plays an essential role in the determination of the noise properties of the light . in the present work",
    "we have used the numerical treatment used in @xcite applied to an ensemble of cold atoms .",
    "the details of this calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we briefly remind the reader of the essential ingredients .     and d@xmath7 @xmath0rb lines . [ fig : level_scheme ] right : schematic diagram of the experimental setup.[fig : exp_setup ] , title=\"fig : \" ] and d@xmath7 @xmath0rb lines .",

    "the heisenberg - langevin equations for atoms and fields are numerically solved at steady state . for this , the loss of atoms at rate @xmath13 is compensated by source terms representing the arrival of fresh atoms isotropically distributed in the ground state zeeman sublevels . as a consequence , the parameter @xmath13 governs , at the same time , the decay of coherence ( in the absence of light ) and the arrival of fresh atoms into the system .",

    "the dependence of the maximum and minimum quadrature noise levels in the output field polarization component perpendicular to that of the incident driving field is shown as a function of the driving laser detuning from the @xmath32 transition .",
    "results for different values of @xmath33 and @xmath13 are presented .",
    "it can be seen that the level of squeezing as well as the contrast ( difference between maximum and minimum quadrature noise ) grows with increased cooperativity parameter ( optical density ) .",
    "the contrast diminishes as the laser detuning increases .",
    "as expected , the noise approaches the sql noise level for both quadratures for a very far detuned laser , since in this case the light does not interact with the atoms .",
    "interestingly enough , there is an optimum in the transient decay rate ( @xmath34 ) , which gives the highest amount of noise suppression below the sql .",
    "this may seem counter intuitive , since it is generally believed that psr squeezing is due to coherent effects and should increase for longer ground state coherence times .",
    "however , the ground state coherence time also depends on light intensity through the off - resonance optical pumping rate @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the excited states hyperfine levels separation ) . only when @xmath37 , the decoherence mechanisms represented by @xmath13 will limit the squeezing efficiency . on the other hand ,",
    "increasing values of @xmath13 correspond to larger number of `` fresh '' atoms participating in the nonlinear interaction process resulting in larger modifications of the light fluctuations .    in the following section we compare our experimental data with the results of the numerical predictions .",

    "absorption imaging of the atomic cloud shows that the mot holds about @xmath44 @xmath0rb atoms in a spherical cloud with a gaussian distribution , with gaussian radius of about 0.5  mm .",
    "ballistic expansion measurements indicate that the atoms are held at an average temperature of 300  @xmath18k and when the trapping lasers are turned off , the cloud expands at a rate of 200  @xmath45 .",
    "the trap magnetic field gradient has a typical value of 5 g / cm .",
    "the sample has a peak density of about @xmath46 atoms/@xmath47 giving an optical depth on the order of 2 for the driving laser transition .",
    "our linearly polarized driving laser , with variable output power ( @xmath18w - @xmath48  mw ) , was tuned around the @xmath49 transitions .",
    "our previous study showed that if the mot lasers are off , the typical lifetime of an atom in the beam is less then a ms ( especially near resonance ) due to light pressure  @xcite exerted by the driving beam .",
    "since we wanted to perform continuous squeezing experiments , we keep the mot lasers on to continuously repopulate the cloud with rb atoms .",
    "the presence of the mot trapping beam helps to maintain the atomic cloud centered around the zero of the magnetic field . in previous observations , where the trapping beams were turned off",
    ", we could observe that light pressure and cloud expansion resulted in a nonzero average magnetic field of the order of @xmath50  tesla  @xcite .",
    "the driving laser light travels through a single mode fiber to achieve a spatially clean gaussian beam , and then passes through a glan polarizer ( gp ) to enforce a linear polarization of the driving beam .",
    "we use a pair of lenses ( l ) to focus the driving laser in the interaction region to a beam diameter of around 250 @xmath18 m ( @xmath51 intensity level ) .",
    "the rb cloud is larger than the beam diameter and serves as a reservoir of cold atoms during the experiment .",
    "we then separate the linearly polarized strong driving field from the squeezed vacuum with a polarizing beamsplitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the strong port is attenuated to 100 @xmath52 and serves as a local oscillator ( lo ) in the custom made balanced homodyne detector ( bpd ) .",
    "the lo field is rotated by an extra 90@xmath53 with a half - wave plate in order to match the polarization of the vacuum channel .",
    "the vacuum channel and lo fields pass through glan polarizers in order to improve the extinction ratio of the pbs , and are finally mixed on a non - polarizing beam splitter ( npbs ) .",
    "the beamsplitter outputs are directed to two matched photodiodes ( hamamatsu s5106 ) , each having a 93% quantum efficiency , where the two photo currents are electronically subtracted .",
    "we analyze the remaining noise with a spectrum analyzer at 1.4  mhz with a resolution bandwidth ( rbw ) of 100  khz .",
    "the overall mode matching of the vacuum channel to the lo mode is checked via observation of the interference fringes with visibility higher than 95% .",
    "the vacuum channel has a piezo ceramic transducer ( pzt ) attached to one of the mirrors .",
    "this allows us to sweep the relative phase between the lo and vacuum channel , and consequently to measure the noise in the different quadrature projections .",
    "[ fig : noise_vs_quad_angle ] shows examples of such a sweep .",
    "the 0  db noise level corresponds to the shot noise , which we determine by introducing a solid block into the vacuum channel .",
    "noise below 0  db indicates squeezing .",

    "[ fig : noise_vs_quad_angle],title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "due to the relatively small number of atoms ( @xmath59 ) interacting with the psr driving beam the overall noise contrast is below 0.8  db ( see fig.[fig : noise_vs_quad_angle ] , left panel , for the highest contrast case ) , which is significantly smaller in comparison with the psr squeezing contrast typically observed in hot rb cells .",
    "it is important to note in this comparison that the number of interacting atoms in the hot cell is approximately one thousand times higher .",
    "the experimentally observed optical density is only around 2 , which is far from the high cooperativity parameters required to achieve the significant noise contrast presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise_vs_detun_dif_coop ] .    in order to record the minimum and maximum noise level dependence on the driving laser detuning , we set our laser to a given detuning ( controlled with a commercial wave meter with 10  mhz accuracy ) , and recorded noise versus the quadrature angle dependence similar to that shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : noise_vs_quad_angle ] .",
    "on such a trace , we note the maximum and minimum noise levels , which provide two data points for each detuning shown in fig.[fig : noise_vs_detun_exp_and_theory](a , b , and c ) .",
    "note that at detunings exactly matching the atomic transitions ( 0 and 815  mhz ) , we have zero noise contrast and the overall noise level drops to shot noise . we attribute this to the strong light pressure of the driving beam on the atoms at frequencies very close to the transitions , which blows away the atomic cloud .",
    "we take such contrast measurements versus detuning spectra at several driving laser powers and see that contrast initially grows with power since the nonlinear psr interaction is increases with laser power , but then the contrast decreases due to a stronger effect of light pushing the atoms away from the interaction region with increased power .",
    "we also note that the highest contrast position moves away from the transition frequencies with increasing power ( more negative for @xmath60 transition , and positive for @xmath61 ) due to power broadening of the transition resonance .",

    "such cold atom instruments are well within the experimental reach of the current state of technology ; for instance , it is possible to have a large magneto optical trap with up to @xmath71 atoms  @xcite , or to create an asymmetric cigar - shaped mot so that the longer dimension can be aligned with the psr driving beam  @xcite thus achieving a quite substantial optical depth and a considerably higher number of interacting atoms .    with these improvements and more studies , we believe that generation of squeezed vacuum with higher levels of noise suppression than seen in hot vapor cells is achievable using psr in cold atoms .",
