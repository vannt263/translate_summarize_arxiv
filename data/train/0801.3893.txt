    "is it true that @xmath14 is always an algebraic integer ( belongs to @xmath15 $ ] ) , even when the order of @xmath12 is not a prime ?",
    "the positive answer to this question was given first for _ integral homology spheres _ by habiro @xcite , and then for arbitrary 3manifolds by the first and third author @xcite , in connection with the study of `` strong integrality '' .",
    "what habiro proved for integral homology 3spheres is actually much stronger than integrality . for any integral homology",
    "3sphere @xmath0 , habiro @xcite constructed a _ unified invariant _ @xmath16 whose evaluation at any root of unity coincides with the value of the witten  reshetikhin ",
    "turaev invariant at that root .",
    "habiro s unified invariant @xmath16 is an element of the following ring ( habiro s ring ) @xmath17 } { ( ( q;q)_k ) } ,   \\qquad \\text { where } \\quad ( q;q)_k = \\prod_{j=1}^k ( 1-q^j).\\ ] ] every element @xmath18 can be written as an infinite sum @xmath19 with @xmath20 $ ] .",

    "the fact that the unified invariant belongs to @xmath24 is stronger than just integrality of @xmath14",

    "the habiro ring has beautiful arithmetic properties .",

    "due to these properties the habiro ring is also called a ring of `` analytic functions at roots of unity '' @xcite .",
    "thus belonging to @xmath24 means that the collection of the @xmath5 wrt invariants is far from a random collection of algebraic integers ; together they form a nice function .",
    "perturbative expansion at 1 of wrt invariants for rational homology 3spheres was first constructed by ohtsuki in the case when the order of the quantum parameter @xmath12 is prime @xcite .",
    "general properties of the habiro ring imply that for any integral homology 3sphere @xmath0 , the taylor expansion of the unified invariant @xmath16 at @xmath29 coincides with the ohtsuki series and dominates wrt invariants of @xmath0 at all roots of unity ( not only of prime order ) .    to generalize habiro s results to rational homology 3spheres , new ideas and techniques are required .",
    "strong integrality of quantum invariants for rational homology 3spheres was studied in @xcite and @xcite . among other things , in @xcite a unified invariant was constructed for the case when the order @xmath30 of the quantum parameter @xmath12 is coprime with @xmath4 . in @xcite , it was proved that for any 3manifold @xmath0 ( not necessary a rational homology 3sphere ) , the @xmath5 wrt invariant @xmath14 is always an algebraic integer , i.e. @xmath31 $ ] with no restriction on the order of @xmath12 at all .",

    "the strategy here is again analogous to the habiro case : in proposition [ twwb ] we will decompose @xmath921 into simple parts : the top is a bottom tangle with zero linking matrix , the next is a good morphism , and the bottom is a morphism obtained by pasting copies of @xmath1004 . since , any bottom tangle with zero linking matrix satisfies theorem [ mmm ] and @xmath1004 is the product in @xmath938 , which preserves the gradings , it remains to show that any good morphism preserves the gradings .",

    "similarly , @xmath1008 does not have any maximum points ; hence @xmath2 can be isotoped off @xmath1025 into @xmath1024 .",
    "since the pair @xmath1027 is homeomorphic to the pair @xmath1029 one can isotope @xmath2 in @xmath1024 to the bottom end points of down arrows .",
    "we then obtain the desired presentation .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "since @xmath989 is invariant under cabling and skein relations , and by lemma [ a8 ] below , both relations preserve @xmath1033 and @xmath1034 , we consider the quotient of @xmath1035 by these relations known as a skein module of @xmath978 . for @xmath1036 , this module has a natural algebra structure , with good morphisms forming a subalgebra . by lemma [ a9 ]",
    "( see also figure [ wgamma ] ) , the basis elements @xmath1037 of this subalgebra are labeled by @xmath57tuples @xmath1038 .",
    "it s clear that if the proposition holds for @xmath1039 and @xmath1040 , then it holds for @xmath1041 .",
    "hence it remains to check the claim for @xmath1037 s .",
    "this is done in corollary [ cora10 ] for basic good morphisms corresponding to @xmath1042 whose non ",
    "zero @xmath1043 s are consecutive .",
    "finally , any @xmath1037 can be obtained by pasting a basic good morphism with few copies of @xmath1044 . since @xmath1045 preserves gradings ( compare ( 3.15 ) , ( 3.16 ) in @xcite ) , the claim follows from lemmas [ a9 ] , [ a8 ] and proposition [ 3308 ] below .",
    "* suppose @xmath1046 for some @xmath91 .",

    "the second cabling relation is @xmath1050 , where @xmath81 is the link @xmath2 with the color of the @xmath91th component switched to @xmath1051 , and @xmath1052 is obtained from @xmath2 by replacing the @xmath91th component with two of its parallels , which are colored with @xmath1053 and @xmath506 .      *",
    "the first skein relation is @xmath1054 , where @xmath88 denotes the unknot with framing zero and color 2 .",
    "* let @xmath1055 , @xmath1056 and @xmath1057 be unoriented framed links with colors 2 which are identical except in a disc where they are as shown in figure [ skein ] .",
    "then the second skein relation is @xmath1058 if the two strands in the crossing come from different components of @xmath1055 , and @xmath1059 if the two strands come from the same component of @xmath1055 , producing a crossing of sign @xmath1060 ( i.e. appearing as in @xmath1061 of figure [ skein ] if @xmath1055 is oriented ) .      using the cabling relations",
    ", we can reduce all colors of @xmath2 in @xmath1062 to be 2 .",
    "note that the skein module @xmath1063 has a natural algebra structure , given by putting one cube on the top of the other .",
    "let us denote by @xmath1064 the subalgebra of this skein algebra generated by good morphisms .",
    "using linearity , we can extend the definition of @xmath989 to @xmath1068 , where @xmath2 is _ any element _ of @xmath976 .",
    "it is known that @xmath989 is invariant under the cablings and skein relations ( theorem 4.3 of @xcite ) , hence @xmath989 is defined for @xmath1069 .",
    "moreover , we have        let us now assume that all colors of @xmath2 are equal to 2 and therefore @xmath1072 the statement is obvious for the first skein relation .",
    "for the second skein relation , choose an arbitrary orientation on l. let us first assume that the two strands in the crossing depicted in figure [ skein ] come from the same component of @xmath1055 and that the crossing is positive . then , @xmath1056 and @xmath1057 have one positive self  crossing less , and @xmath1056 has one link component more than @xmath1055 .",
    "therefore @xmath1073 it is obvious , that this does not depend on the orientation of @xmath1055 .",
    "if the crossing of @xmath1055 is negative or the two strands do not belong to the same component of @xmath1055 , the proof works similar .",
    "the statement holds true for @xmath1086 .",
    "now lemma 7.4 in @xcite states that applying @xmath1087 to the @xmath91th component of the universal quantum invariant of a tangle is the same as duplicating the @xmath91th component .",
    "using this fact we represent [ jn ] j_z_n+1 = ( 1_^n-1 _ ) ( j_z_n ) , where @xmath1088 is defined as follows . for @xmath1089 with @xmath1090 , we put @xmath1091 where the @xmath256matrix is given by @xmath1092 .",
