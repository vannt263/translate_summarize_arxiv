    "how many different measurement settings are needed in order to uniquely determine a pure quantum state , and how should such measurements be chosen ?",
    "this problem goes back to a famous remark by w.  pauli @xcite , in which he raised the question whether or not the position and the momentum distributions are enough to define the wave function uniquely modulo a global phase .",
    "the original _ pauli problem _ has a negative answer @xcite , but it has evolved into many interesting variants and has been studied from several fruitful perspectives .",
    "discussion of the vast literature lies outside the scope of this work .",
    "instead , we will concentrate only on a specific form of the pauli problem , which is concerned with the minimal number of orthonormal bases , or projective measurements , in a finite dimensional hilbert space that is needed in order to distinguish all pure quantum states .",
    "we require that _ all _ pure states are determined , so schemes that allow the determination of merely almost all pure states are outside of the scope of this work , even if they are interesting and important from the practical point of view .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the essential results related to our question in a comprehensible way .",
    "it is quite obvious that a single orthonormal basis can not distinguish all pure states in a @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space , while it is known that with @xmath5 bases it is possible to distinguish all states , pure or mixed .",
    "the problem of finding the minimal number of orthonormal bases determining an unknown pure state has been raised several times in the past .",
    "it is easy to verify that the minimal number is three in dimension @xmath6 , but in higher dimensions the problem becomes more difficult . in 1978",
    "a.  vogt reported on r.  wright s conjecture that three orthonormal bases are sufficient to identify an unknown pure state in any finite dimension @xcite . in 1983",
    "moroz made the same claim and presented a proof for it @xcite , but in the erratum he explains that his proof does not work for all pure states and credits m.  gromov for pointing out an argument that shows that at least four bases are needed in large dimensions @xcite . in 1994",
    "this argument was spelled out in greater detail by moroz and a.m.  perellomov @xcite , and they concluded that at least four bases are needed for any dimension @xmath7 .",
    "we will see that this conclusion can be extended to all dimensions @xmath2 as a direct implication of the result of @xcite .",
    "the sufficiency of four generic orthonormal bases for unique pure state determination was found by d.  mondragon and v.  voroninski @xcite , and a concrete method for constructing four bases with the desired property was recently introduced by p.  jaming @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by giving a precise mathematical formulation of the question in sec .",
    "[ sec : question ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qubit ] we give an elementary argument for the fact that two orthonormal bases can not distinguish all pure states in any dimension @xmath4 . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : qutrit ] we review the rank criterion first found in @xcite and explain how this implies that three bases are not enough in dimension @xmath8 . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4bases ] we give a thorough presentation of jaming s construction of four bases .",
    "we continue in sec .",
    "[ sec : lower_bound ] with the most technical part of this paper , which reviews the argument presented in @xcite that implies the impossibility of three bases in dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "all these results together mean that the minimal number of orthonormal bases that are able to distinguish all pure quantum states is :    * three for @xmath0 * four for @xmath1 and all dimensions @xmath2 * either three or four in @xmath3 .    curiously , the final answer in @xmath3 still remains open . in sec .",
    "[ sec : localbas ] we rule out specific types of triples of bases , namely , those consisting solely of product vectors with respect to a splitting of the hilbert space into a tensor product of @xmath6-dimensional spaces . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin1 ] we treat spin-@xmath9 measurements to highlight the fact that even if four bases can distinguish all pure quantum states , these bases must be chosen appropriately and it may happen that some natural choices are not the best ones .",
    "we end this paper with a brief discussion of the problem in an infinite dimensional hilbert space in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "let @xmath10 be a finite @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space .",

    "a quantum state @xmath11 is _ pure _ if it can not be written as a mixture @xmath13 of two different states @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "pure quantum states correspond to @xmath9-dimensional projections .",
    "they can be alternatively described as rays of vectors in @xmath10 , meaning that two vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to the same pure state if there is a nonzero complex number @xmath18 such that @xmath19 . for a unit vector @xmath20 ,",
    "the corresponding density matrix is @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be an orthonormal basis of @xmath10 .",
    "( from now on , the term _ basis _ means an orthonormal basis . )",
    "if we perform a measurement of this basis in a state @xmath11 , then we get an outcome @xmath23 with the probability @xmath24 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath25 encodes the information that this measurement gives us about the unknown state @xmath11 .",
    "it is quite clear that this information is not enough to determine the input state uniquely .",
    "for instance , the pure states corresponding to the unit vectors @xmath26 are different but they lead to the same probability distribution . if our aim is to identify an unknown quantum state uniquely , we should thus measure more than one orthonormal basis .",
    "let @xmath27 be @xmath28 orthonormal bases of @xmath10 .",
    "we say that the bases @xmath29 distinguish two different states @xmath14 and @xmath15 if @xmath30 for some @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this means that if we get the probability distributions related to all @xmath28 bases in the states @xmath14 and @xmath15 , then the measurement data corresponding to these two states are different .",
    "we say that the orthonormal bases @xmath29 _ distinguish all pure states _ if they distinguish any pair of different pure states .",
    "following @xcite , we also say that in this case the bases @xmath29 are _ informationally complete with respect to pure states_.    we recall that it is possible to find finite collections of orthonormal bases that can distinguish all pure states .",
    "namely , it is known that there exist @xmath5 orthonormal bases which distinguish _ all _ states , pure or mixed ; see e.g. @xcite for a construction .",
    "less than @xmath5 bases can not distinguish all states simply because not enough parameters are determined .",
    "however , the pure states form a non - convex subset of all states , and one can not thus rule out the possibility that less than @xmath5 bases can distinguish all pure states .",
    "this leads to our main question stated in the title :    _ how many orthonormal bases are needed in order to distinguish all pure states ? _",
    "one may be tempted to criticize this question on the grounds that in any real experiment the states are perhaps never completely pure .",
    "but as any problem of this type , also this should be considered as a question on the fundamental limits of quantum theory . as",
    "such , we believe that it reveals an interesting and even surprising aspect of the duality of states and measurements .",
    "as a warm up , let us consider the case of a qubit , i.e. , @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known and explained also in almost any textbook that one can choose three orthonormal bases such that the related measurement outcome distributions determine an unknown qubit state uniquely .",
    "this is rather obvious if one looks at the bloch representation @xmath33 of qubit states , where @xmath34 is a vector in @xmath35 satisfying @xmath36 and @xmath37 consists of pauli matrices . since @xmath38},{\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\varrho \\sigma_y\\right]},{\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\varrho \\sigma_z\\right ] } ) \\ , , \\ ] ] we conclude that measurements of the eigenbases of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 specify the vector @xmath34 and hence also the state @xmath42 . more generally , if we fix three linearly independent unit vectors @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 in @xmath35 , then the measurements of the eigenbases of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 distinguish all states .",
    "a qubit state @xmath42 is pure exactly when @xmath49 .",
    "the direction of a unit vector @xmath34 depends on two parameters only , so one may wonder if two orthonormal bases can suffice to determine any pure qubit state .",
    "this is not true , in fact , in any dimension :    [ prop:2bases ] in any dimension @xmath50 , two orthonormal bases can not distinguish all pure states .",
    "our proof of this statement has been motivated by theorem 1 in @xcite .",
