    "@xmath22 , the number of images is not always @xmath24 .",
    "the singular isothermal sphere lens is given by setting @xmath22 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the velocity dispersion of particles .",
    "in this section we will discuss the signed magnification sums of the general spherical lens model for @xmath76 in the directly aligned limit @xmath77 .    for @xmath78 , the positive solution @xmath79 and the negative solution @xmath80 of the lens equation ( [ eq : n+1th_lens_eq ] ) represent an outer image angle and an inner image angle while @xmath79 and @xmath80 are an inner one and an outer one for @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the positive solution @xmath82 monotonically increases as @xmath52 increases .",
    "the signed magnifications of the images in the weak field limit are given by @xmath83    the lens equation ( [ eq : n+1th_lens_eq ] ) has symmetry with respect to the point @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 and @xmath86 thus , the relation of the magnifications is given by @xmath87    the positive image angle and the magnification in the directly aligned limit ( @xmath88 ) are given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively . from the symmetry , we can easily obtain the negative image angle and the signed magnification in the directly aligned limit @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "therefore the total magnification and the ratio of the magnifications in the directly aligned limit are given by @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively .",
    "figure 4 shows that one can distinguish the general spherical lens models with their signed magnification sums @xmath95 which are less than unity .",
    "we also can see that one can distinguish @xmath41 from @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 but one can not distinguish between @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 .    , @xmath24 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "this shows that we can distinguish each models from the others.,width=302 ]    the minimum value of the signed magnification sums is given by @xmath100 the lower bound of the total magnification @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 therefore , gravitational lensing necessarily gives amplified light curves for @xmath41 , while it does not necessarily for @xmath103 .    from the lens equation  ( [ eq : n+1th_lens_eq ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath104 for @xmath105 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : jacobian ] ) implies that @xmath106 because @xmath107 , while @xmath108 because @xmath109 . in other words , if it is far from the alignment , the positive image is as luminous as the unlensed image , while the negative image is extremely faint .",
    "thus , we can ignore the gravitational lensing effects and the signed magnification sum @xmath95 becomes almost unity for @xmath55 .",
    "the difference of the reduced image angle in the directly aligned limit is given by @xmath110 thus , the einstein ring angle is given by @xmath111    for @xmath22 these analyses are not valid in the region @xmath112 because of the non - existence of the negative image angle @xmath113 .",
    "however , it is valid in the region @xmath114 . for @xmath112 ,",
    "the magnification is @xmath115 and the total magnification @xmath116 is always 2 in the range @xmath114 .",
    "so one can also distinguish the case @xmath22 from the other cases .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the ellis wormhole spacetime  @xcite and the deflection angle on it  @xcite .",
    "the ellis spacetime was investigated as a geodesically complete particle model by ellis  @xcite and turned out to describe a wormhole connecting two minkowski spacetimes .",
    "the ellis wormhole spacetime is a static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat solution of the einstein equation with a massless scalar field with a wrong sign as a matter field .",
    "although such a matter field violates energy conditions , it could represent the negative energy density from the quantum effects , such as the casimir effect .",
    "this spacetime is a typical and simplest example of wormholes proposed by morris and thorne  @xcite .",
    "this is a traversable wormhole in the sense that an observer can cross this wormhole in both directions .",
    "the line element in the ellis wormhole solution is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a positive constant corresponding the radius of the wormhole throat at @xmath119 .",
    "the photon is scattered if @xmath120 , while reaches the throat if @xmath121 .",
    "since we are interested in the scattering problem , we assume @xmath120 .",
    "chetouani and clement  @xcite derived the exact deflection angle @xmath10 of light on the ellis wormhole geometry as follows : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the deflection angle is diverging in the limit @xmath124 , while it is approximately given in the weak - field regime @xmath125 by @xmath126 therefore , in our parametrization of general spherical lenses , the ellis wormhole lens reduces to the case @xmath96 and @xmath127 in the weak - field regime .",
    "it is well known that the signed magnification sum of the schwarzschild lens is always unity in the weak field limit .",
    "we realize that one can distinguish the exotic lenses with the parameter @xmath103 of the general spherical lens such as ellis wormhole from mass lens systems because the signed magnification sums of exotic lenses are less than unity .",
    "it is also easy to determine @xmath18 by the signed magnification sums .",
    "the signed magnification sum is a powerful tool to find exotic lens objects because it only depends on the deduced source angle @xmath52 and @xmath18 and we just have to observe the images for @xmath128 and for @xmath129 to determine the signed magnification sum .",
    "however , we need a high resolution to observe the double images",
    ". we would also distinguish the lens objects with the ratio of magnifications of the double images and the total magnification .",
    "if we also measure the difference @xmath130 of the image angles , one can determine the einstein ring angle @xmath131 and the source angle @xmath132 .",
    "abe suggests that one can detect the ellis wormholes by observing the light curves with the characteristic demagnification @xcite .",
    "notice that the method to distinguish the lens objects with the signed magnification sums would be used in both the magnification and demagnification phases .",
    "thus , we do not have to rely on only the demagnification to detect the ellis wormholes .",
    "our method with the signed magnification sums is complementary to the methods to detect exotic lens objects with the light curves @xcite and the astrometric image centroid displacements @xcite . to observe double images are much more feasible than to observe relativistic",
    "einstein rings @xcite because relativistic images are faint and small and because relativistic rings are rare sights .",
