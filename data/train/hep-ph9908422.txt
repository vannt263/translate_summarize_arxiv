    "the processes of single- and double - photon emission associated with a large missing energy are very important for the precision test of the standard model and the search for any new ( invisible ) particles beyond the standard model .",
    "in fact the number of the light - neutrino generations has been measured using this process on the @xmath5-pole at the lep experiments@xcite . the efforts to find new invisible particles , such as a neutral ( lightest ) susy particle or a sequential heavy neutrino ,",
    "are now continued by the lep-2 experiments at higher energies@xcite . in this case , however , the neutrino pair - productions with hard - photon emission are the main background for the investigation . with the increase of the accumulated luminosity",
    ", the cross sections of these processes must require more precision with an uncertainty of @xmath6(1% ) .",
    "in addition since @xmath7 includes the triple(quartic ) gauge couplings , there is a possibility to find some new effects beyond the standard model on these rather poor - tested couplings .",
    "there are some methods to estimate the cross sections including the higher order qed corrections .",
    "the simplest one would be to combine the matrix elements of @xmath8 with some tool for the initial - state radiations(isr ) .",
    "the hard photon(s ) may be supplied , for instance , by a parton shower , which can treat the photons with a finite transverse momentum(@xmath9 ) . when this method is applied to the center - of - mass system(cms ) energies above the @xmath5-boson mass",
    ", however , the leading logarithmic ( ll ) approximation is not sufficient .",
    "this is because the colliding energy after the photon emission can match the @xmath5-pole(radiative return ) , and the probability to emit high - energy photon(s ) is largely enhanced .",
    "when this happens the ll approximation is not successful in describing the spectrum around the @xmath5 pole . to improve the precision of the calculations the non - ll terms for isr",
    "must be taken into account as well as the ll terms . however , there exist no complete calculations up to the non - ll order .",
    "another possible way is to make use of the matrix elements of @xmath10 process and their compact approximated form were first given in ref.@xcite . ] together with the isr tool .",
    "diagrams of the single(double)-photon emission are shown in fig.1 ( fig.2 ) , respectively .",
    "the visible and invisible hard - photon(s ) are fed by the matrix elements as well as by the isr tools .",
    "here it is crucial to avoid the double counting in the radiations coming from these two different sources . the conventional qed structure function is not suitable for this purpose because it is obtained after the integration over all allowed phase - space of the emitted photons except for their energy .",
    "thus the double counting necessarily happens and can not be excluded .",
    "there exists no full electroweak one - loop calculation for @xmath0 .",
    "only the limited corrections , one - loop qed corrections and self - energy corrections to the @xmath5-exchange diagrams@xcite are available . though there is no one - loop calculation at all for the @xmath11 process",
    ", the isr tools might cover the most important corrections and allows us to give a realistic event generator which can meet the required theoretical uncertainty of @xmath6(1% ) .",
    "the koralz monte carlo program@xcite exploits the exact matrix elements of the single - photon processes with @xmath12 and @xmath13 production(an approximation is made for @xmath14 ) together with the exclusive exponentiation of yfs@xcite as the isr tool .",
    "another event generator is nunugvp@xcite , which uses the exact matrix elements of the single- and multi(up to three)-photon emission(for all kinds of neutrinos ) generated by the alpha algorithm@xcite and the @xmath9-depending structure function@xcite for isr .",
    "both programs include anomalous triple - gauge - boson coupling(tgc ) in the package .    in this report a new event generator * grc@xmath3 * is proposed .",
    "it adopts the exact matrix elements for @xmath10 generated by means of the grace system@xcite combined with qedps@xcite for isr .",
    "the advantages of these packages are :    * the exact matrix elements up to the double - photon emission , including the @xmath14 process , are used .",
    "double - photon emission is practically sufficient for experimental analysis .",
    "* qedps keeps the complete kinematics for the emitted photons and virtual electrons before collisions .",
    "it allows a more flexible treatment of the isr effects in avoiding the double - counting .    in section 2 , the calculation method ,",
    "particularly how to connect qedps to the radiative processes without double counting , is explained .",
    "the numerical results of single- and double - photon emission are presented in section 3 .",
    "a detailed comparison among * grc@xmath3 * , the exact @xmath4 calculations , koralz and nunugpv is also given in this section .",
    "the effects of the anomalous tgc in the single - photon events are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "appendix describes how to obtain and use the * grc@xmath3 * program .",
    "the exact matrix - elements of all the processes are produced by an automatic calculation system grace .",
    "it generates the fortran routines needed to calculate the amplitudes numerically based on the helicity - amplitude formalism .    for isr",
    "the parton shower algorithm for qed , qedps , is used . in this algorithm",
    "the altarelli - parisi equation is solved in the ll approximation@xcite using the monte carlo method .",
    "the details of this method can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we recall that the algorithm can maintain the exact kinematics during the evolution of an electron .",
    "let us consider the branching process @xmath15 where the parent electron , whose virtuality is @xmath16 , has the momentum @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the momentum of the system in the infinite - momentum - frame .",
    "a cutoff mass @xmath21 is introduced for the photon .",
    "then the momenta of the daughter particles , @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 , can be expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 assuming @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 which determines @xmath30 from @xmath31 , @xmath16 and @xmath32 . hence one can obtain the distribution of the transverse momentum of the emitted photons , @xmath30 .",
    "moreover this enables us to find the virtuality of the electron , @xmath33 , as well as its energy , just before the collision .",
    "the phase - space integration of the matrix element squared is carried out numerically by bases@xcite using an adaptive monte carlo method .",
    "the integration is done in the five(eight)-dimensional kinematical phase - space of the three(four)-body final state .",
    "the evolution of the initial - state electrons by qedps is treated independently of bases .    since the qedps can provide a complete kinematical information about the emitted photons and the virtual electrons , it is easy to distinguish the photons from the matrix - elements and those from the parton shower .",
    "let us divide the full one - photon phase space @xmath34 into two regions : one is for the @xmath35 region , @xmath36 , and the other is for the @xmath37 region , @xmath38 .",
    "these are defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy of the photon and @xmath41 is its polar angle in degree from the beam axis .",
    "the minimum energy and angle , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , must be given by the experimental condition .",
    "first the photons from qedps , @xmath44 s , are restricted to go inside of @xmath38 and the photon from the matrix - elements , @xmath45 , is emitted into @xmath36 . since there is no overlap between these two regions no double - counting occurs .",
    "in addition the ordering of the electron virtuality is also required . during the evolution of an electron",
    "the virtuality is monotonically increasing , which is realized naturally in the qedps algorithm .",
    "a further condition must be imposed on the virtuality of the electron in the matrix - elements after emitting the photon : it should be greater than the virtuality of the electron in the last stage of qedps .",
    "the configuration mentioned here can not cover all the configurations for the photon emission .",
    "when @xmath46 photons are emitted from one electron line , the first ( @xmath47 ) photons are fed by qedps , including the statistical factor of @xmath48 , and only the last photon is supplied by the matrix element .",
    "this configuration represents the case where the first ( @xmath47 ) @xmath44 s are invisible but only the last one , @xmath45 , is visible .",
    "another case also exists .",
    "one of the first ( @xmath47 ) @xmath44 s goes into @xmath36 while the other ( @xmath49 ) @xmath44 s and @xmath45 escape into @xmath38 .",
    "though @xmath45 is invisible in this case , the results are free from any infrared divergence thanks to the virtuality cut @xmath21 introduced above .",
    "the minimum energy of @xmath45 is determined from the minimum virtuality imposed by the qedps evolution .",
    "if there is no radiative return the contribution of this second configuration is negligible small .",
    "however , for the process @xmath10 above the @xmath50 threshold its contribution to the total cross section becomes sizeable , typically about a few % .    besides the above - mentioned pure qed corrections another class of electro - weak higher order corrections",
    "should be included in the calculations .",
    "the * grc@xmath3 * package has two schemes to do this : the running coupling constant and the @xmath51 scheme@xcite . in the former the coupling constant of the @xmath52-@xmath52-@xmath5 vertex , @xmath53 ,",
    "is determined by evolving it from zero momentum transfer to the mass squared of the @xmath2 system , @xmath54 , which differs from one event to another .",
    "it varies according to the renormalization group equation ( rge ) as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the qed coupling at the zero momentum transfer , @xmath57 the color factor , @xmath58 the electric charge , @xmath59 the mass of the @xmath60 s fermion , and @xmath60 runs over all massive fermions . in this scheme @xmath61",
    "should be fixed event - by - event , but is common for all @xmath5-exchange diagrams in the same event .",
    "the latter scheme is such that the weak couplings are determined through the weak - mixing angle , @xmath62 , which is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 being the @xmath65-boson mass and @xmath51 the muon decay constant . in this scheme",
    "the input is the precisely measured value of @xmath51 at zero momentum transfer and @xmath66 is the qed coupling evolved to a typical energy scale of the processes which should be chosen by the users . in the present version of the program the loop corrections expressed by @xmath67 in the formula",
    "is ignored(@xmath68 ) .",
    "then the difference between the running @xmath53 scheme and the @xmath51 scheme is to use the fixed energy scale(for @xmath51 ) or the event - dependent energy scale(for running @xmath53 ) .",
    "the package * grc@xmath3 * has a switch to choose either of the above corrections or no higher - order corrections .",
    "when users select the last option , the weak couplings are simply fixed by @xmath64 and @xmath69 through the on - shell relation , @xmath70 , where @xmath69 is the mass of the @xmath5-boson .",
    "2 .   compilation . + by executing command make install the executable of the interface program is generated at bindir .",
