    "one of the fundamental question in the theory of quantum entanglement is how to distinguish and construct entangled states .",
    "even though the ppt criterion @xcite gives us a simple and powerful necessary condition for separability together with the range criterion @xcite , it is not clear how to distinguish entanglement satisfying these two criteria .",
    "one of the possible way to overcome this difficulty is to compare the geometries for separable states and ppt states , as it was suggested in a recent work @xcite .",
    "we note that the set of all separable states ( respectively ppt states ) makes a convex set , which will be denoted by @xmath9 ( respectively @xmath10 ) . in order to understand the geometry of a convex set",
    ", we need to characterize the facial structures .",
    "the facial structures for the convex set @xmath10 is relatively well understood @xcite .",
    "it is also known @xcite that a given ppt state @xmath11 satisfies the range criterion if and only if the face of @xmath10 determined by @xmath11 has a separable state in its interior . if we understand the facial structures of the corresponding face of @xmath9 , then it is easy to distinguish and construct entangled states within the face of @xmath10 .",
    "this is the case when the corresponding face for @xmath9 is affinely isomorphic to a simplex .",
    "the authors @xcite exploited this idea for the @xmath12 case , to construct faces of @xmath9 which are isomorphic to the simplex @xmath13 with six extreme points , and understand how ppt entangled edge states of rank four arise .",
    "this construction also gives examples of separable states whose lengths are greater than the maximum of ranks of themselves and their partial transposes .",
    "the main idea was to begin with generic @xmath3-dimensional subspaces of @xmath14 which has six product vectors , and exploit the fact that the number of product vectors is greater than the dimension .    in this paper",
    ", we pursue the same idea for the @xmath15 case , which is the smallest dimension where ppt entangled states arise .",
    "but , the above idea for the @xmath16 case does not work for this case , because the number @xmath17 is the dimension for generic subspaces of @xmath18 with finitely many product vectors , and generic @xmath17-dimensional subspaces have just @xmath17 product vectors . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we consider the equation @xmath19 of subspaces of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denotes the conjugate of @xmath23 .",
    "we construct @xmath3-dimensional spaces @xmath24 and @xmath4-dimensional spaces @xmath25 , for which the above equations have exactly @xmath2 solutions .",
    "this enables us to construct faces of @xmath9 isomorphic to the simplex @xmath1 with ten extreme points .",
    "any interior point of the face @xmath1 is a separable state with the unique decomposition into ten product states , and has the length ten .",
    "this disproves the conjecture @xcite which claims that lengths of @xmath26 separable states are at most @xmath27 .",
    "we recall that a ppt state @xmath11 is of type @xmath28 if the ranks of @xmath11 and @xmath29 are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "we also note that the boundary of this face @xmath32 consists of simplices @xmath33 with @xmath34 extreme points , for @xmath35 . by the construction ,",
    "every interior point of the face @xmath1 is a separable state of type @xmath36 .",
    "we show that any choice of seven product vectors @xmath37 among ten solutions are linearly independent . from this",
    ", we conclude that if a boundary point @xmath38 of @xmath1 is in the interior of @xmath33 with @xmath39 then the line segment from an interior point @xmath40 of @xmath32 to @xmath38 can be extended within the convex set @xmath10 , to get ppt entangled states of rank five . for known examples of @xmath15 ppt entangled states ,",
    "see @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the material behind the above idea we have just explained , and give the construction in the section 3 .",
    "a density matrix @xmath11 in the tensor product @xmath41 of matrix algebras is said to be separable if it is the convex combination of product states , and so it is of the form @xmath42 with unit product vectors @xmath43 in the space @xmath44 and positive numbers @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "a non - separable state is called entangled .",
    "because the partial transpose @xmath29 of the state @xmath11 in ( [ sep ] ) is given by @xmath47 we see that the partial transpose of a separable state is also positive .",
    "this is the ppt criterion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also see that if @xmath11 is separable then there must exist product vectors @xmath43 satisfying @xmath48 as the range criterion @xcite tells , where @xmath49 denotes the range space of the state @xmath11 .",
    "a convex subset @xmath50 of a convex set @xmath51 is said to be a face if it satisfies the condition : if a point in @xmath50 is a convex combination of two points in @xmath51 then they must be points of @xmath50 . a face consisting of a single point is call an extreme point .",
    "a point @xmath52 in a convex set @xmath51 is said to be an interior point of @xmath51 if it is an interior point of @xmath51 with respect to the relative topology of the affine manifold generated by @xmath51 .",
    "it is well known that every convex set is completely partitioned into interiors of faces . in this sense ,",
    "a point @xmath52 in a convex set determines a unique face in which @xmath52 is an interior point .",
    "this is the smallest face containing @xmath52 . a point of @xmath51",
    "is called a boundary point if it is not an interior point .",
    "any face of @xmath10 is determined @xcite by a pair @xmath53 of subspaces of @xmath44 , and is of the form @xmath54 conversely , the set @xmath55 is a face unless it is empty .",
    "the interior of @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 it was also shown in @xcite that a ppt state @xmath11 satisfies the range criterion if and only if the interior of the face @xmath55 of @xmath10 determined by @xmath11 has a separable state . in this case , the face @xmath57 of @xmath9 share interior points with the face @xmath55 of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to understand the facial structures of @xmath57 in order to determine if @xmath11 is separable or not .",
    "the study of facial structures of @xmath9 has been initiated by alfsen and schultz @xcite , where they searched for faces of @xmath9 which is affinely isomorphic to a simplex .",
    "suppose that a convex set @xmath51 is on the hyperplane of codimension one in the @xmath58-dimensional real vector space which does not contain the origin .",
    "then @xmath51 is a simplex if and only if it is the convex hull of @xmath59 linearly independent points on the hyperplane .",
    "this simplex will be denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , if a separable state in ( [ sep ] ) determines a face , then it is isomorphic to a simplex if and only if the product states in the expression are linearly independent in the real vector space of hermitian matrices . for further progress on the facial structures for separable states ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the length of a separable state @xmath11 is defined by the smallest number @xmath61 with which the expression ( [ sep ] ) is possible .",
    "it is clear that if a separable state determines the face isomorphic to the simplex @xmath6 then it has the length @xmath34 .",
    "now , we are ready to explain the main idea of the construction in the next section .",
    "we construct a @xmath3-dimensional space @xmath24 and a @xmath4-dimensional space @xmath25 of @xmath20 , and show the following :    1 .",
    "the equation ( [ equation ] ) has exactly ten solutions .",
    "2 .   the corresponding ten product states are linearly independent .",
    "3 .   any choice of five product vectors @xmath62 span the space @xmath24 .",
    "any choice of seven product vectors @xmath37 span the space @xmath25 .",
    "we conclude that the face @xmath55 has a separable state in the interior by ( iii ) and ( iv ) , and the face @xmath63 is affinely isomorphic to the simplex @xmath1 by ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "we take an interior point @xmath40 in the face @xmath63 , which will be denoted by just @xmath1 , and take a boundary point @xmath38 which determines the face isomorphic to @xmath6 with @xmath35 .",
    "this means that @xmath38 is the convex combination of @xmath34 product states .",
    "consider @xmath64 for @xmath65 . if @xmath66 then @xmath67 is a proper subspace of @xmath68 , and",
    "so we see that @xmath69 is never positive for @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath70 then we see that the range spaces of @xmath40 and @xmath38 coincide by ( iii ) , and same for the range spaces of @xmath71 and @xmath72 by ( iv ) . therefore , we see that there exist @xmath65 such that @xmath69 is of ppt .",
    "it is clear that this is an entangled state .",
    "if we take the largest @xmath73 such that @xmath69 is of ppt then @xmath69 is of type @xmath28 with @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "but , it is not possible to have @xmath74 by @xcite , because @xmath69 is an entangled state .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath69 is of type @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the @xmath3-dimensional subspace of @xmath20 which is orthogonal to the following three vectors : @xmath78 we note that these three vectors span a completely entangled space which has no product vectors .",
    "it is easy to see that every product vector @xmath79 in the space @xmath24 is one of the following forms : @xmath80 .",
    "note that the partial conjugate of @xmath81 , which will be denoted by @xmath82 , is given by @xmath83    for given real numbers @xmath84 and @xmath85 with the relation @xmath86 , we consider the vector latexmath:[\\[\\label{vecw }    the @xmath4-dimensional subspace of @xmath20 orthogonal to the vector @xmath88 .    now",
    ", we proceed to solve the equation ( [ equation ] ) for the above @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we note that the partial conjugate of @xmath89 belongs to @xmath25 , and so @xmath89 is a solution . in order to find complex numbers",
    "@xmath90 so that @xmath81 is a solution , we solve the equation @xmath91 , that is , @xmath92 we first note that @xmath93 must be a real number , and so we have @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath97 is an even integer , then the equation is reduced to @xmath98 and we get two distinct positive roots @xmath99 and @xmath100 from the condition @xmath86 . in the case of an odd integer @xmath97 , we get one positive root @xmath101 of the equation @xmath102 by the same condition .",
    "we also note that @xmath103 are mutually distinct .",
    "therefore , we have the following nine solutions of the equation : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the third root of unity . for the notational convenience ,",
    "we rewrite the normalizations of the product vectors @xmath81 in for the above nine @xmath90 s by @xmath106 for @xmath107 .    in order to show the item ( ii ) in the last section ,",
    "suppose that @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the @xmath110 zero matrix .",
    "note that @xmath111 is given by @xmath112 which is an @xmath110 matrix .",
    "therefore , we get sixty four linear equations with respect to @xmath113 by comparing the entries of the both sides .",
    "if we write @xmath114 which is a @xmath115 matrix , and @xmath116 , then we have the equation @xmath117 we note that entries of the first column of @xmath51 are all zero except the last entry . since we have @xmath118 from the equation , we can conclude that the row vector @xmath119 is the linear combination of three rows of the above matrix @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath120 .",
    "since any nine product states corresponding to the nine product vectors are linearly independent by proposition 2.2 in @xcite , we have @xmath121 .",
    "proposition 2.1 of @xcite also tells us that any choice of five product vectors among ten solutions are linearly independent .    it remains to show the item ( iv ) in the last section . without loss of generality , it suffices to consider the following five cases :    * @xmath122 , * @xmath123 , * @xmath124 , * @xmath125 , * @xmath126 ,    for each case , we form the @xmath127 matrix whose rows are given by the seven product vectors identified with row vectors in @xmath128 .",
    "then , in any cases , it is easy to see that the reduced row echelon form of the matrix is given by @xmath129 therefore , for any choice of seven product vectors among ten solutions , we see that the corresponding seven partial conjugates are linearly independent , and so they span the space @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we illustrate the above discussion with an explicit example .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath130 and @xmath131 in . from the equation @xmath132",
    ", we get two positive solutions @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we also get one positive solution @xmath135 from the equation @xmath136 .    by a direct computation",
    ", we have an interior point @xmath40 of @xmath32 : @xmath137 where @xmath106 is the normalized product vectors with @xmath138 s in .",
    "we consider the @xmath139-simplex @xmath140 determined by these nine product vectors @xmath106 s .",
    "an interior point @xmath38 of this face is given by @xmath141 we put @xmath142 , and explore eigenvalues of @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "we denote by @xmath145 and @xmath146 the eigenvalues of @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "then , we see that there exist @xmath147 so that @xmath148 is on the boundary of the face @xmath55 , which is a ppt entangled edge state of type @xmath77 .",
    "we note that @xmath143 is a ppt entangled state of type @xmath36 for @xmath149 .",

    "note that the number of faces isomorphic to @xmath6 is @xmath153 .",
