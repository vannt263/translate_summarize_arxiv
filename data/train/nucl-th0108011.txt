    "electromagnetic radiation , especially lepton pairs , represents probes of choice for the study of heavy ion reactions . owing to the smallness of their final state interaction they travel essentially unscathed from creation to detection .",
    "furthermore , via vector meson dominance ( vmd ) @xcite , real and virtual photons are ideal as signatures of the in - medium behaviour of vector mesons @xcite .",
    "this aspect has been highlighted in a theoretical interpretation @xcite of the low dilepton invariant mass measurements performed by the ceres collaboration @xcite . in short",
    ", it appears that the behaviour of hot and dense strongly interacting matter can indeed be revealed by electromagnetic observables @xcite .    in this work",
    "we shall outline how symmetry breaking effects can manifest themselves in dilepton spectra .",
    "the first of those involve the possibility of @xmath0 mixing in dense nuclear matter .",
    "the size of this contribution is density - dependent and goes to zero in vacuum , on account of lorentz symmetry .",
    "we show that such a mixing opens up a new channel in dilepton production and will modify the spectrum in the @xmath1 invariant mass region .",
    "secondly , we show that furry s theorem is no longer obeyed in a baryon rich quark gluon plasma .",
    "this has the consequence of permitting new processes like @xmath2 .",
    "we evaluate this contribution and compare it with @xmath3 .",
    "we will consider only dielectrons here and the details of the calculations will only be sketched ; the interested reader is invited to consult the references quoted in the text .",
    "the observables we discuss in this work are within reach of measurements soon to be performed by the hades collaboration at the gsi , and by the phenix collaboration at rhic .",
    "there exists physical processes which are forbidden in free space but can take place in matter . those are related to medium - induced symmetry breaking effects .",
    "the interaction respects the symmetry , but it is broken by the ground state .",
    "for instance , in matter , lorentz symmetry is lost which leads to the mixing of different spin states even when the interaction lagrangian respects all the required symmetry properties . a well - known example of this is @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing in nuclear matter as discussed by chin @xcite .",
    "another manifestation lies in the fact that different polarization states of vector fields can have different dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to identify the effects of scalar and vector meson mixing on dilepton production rates , which could be observed in high energy heavy ion experiments .",
    "the mixing of mesons considered here include both isoscalar and isovector channels .",
    "to be more specific , we estimate the rate of dilepton production from @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath6-@xmath7 mixing . some attention was paid to the former in the context of heavy - ion collisions @xcite , and the importance of the later",
    "was shown recently @xcite . in this first part we present thermal production rates of dileptons induced by scalar - vector mixing in the isoscalar and isovector channels .",
    "those results are compared against @xmath8-@xmath8 , @xmath9-@xmath10 annihilation contributions , which are treated here as standard candles .",
    "note that processes involving mixing of different g - parity states like @xmath4-@xmath5 or @xmath6-@xmath7 are allowed only in matter which is not invariant under charge conjugation .",
    "therefore , @xmath11",
    "@xmath12 @xmath13 through the coupling to nucleons via @xmath4 and @xmath5 , or @xmath14 mediated by @xmath6-@xmath7 mixing , can take place in matter with a finite nucleon chemical potential .",
    "hence it is natural to look for such density - driven effects in experiments involving relatively low energy collisions where one expects to have a relatively large chemical potential .",
    "the interaction lagrangian used in the present model can be written as _ int = g__+ g_a_0 |_a_0,^ + g_nn| _ ^ + + g _ [ | _ ^ + _ ^^ ] ^ _  , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 correspond to nucleon , @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 fields , and the @xmath18 s are pauli matrices . from this point",
    "on we use s and v to denote scalar and vector mesons , _",
    "i.e. _ s = @xmath4 , @xmath7 and v = @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "it is understood that @xmath19 .",
    "the polarization vector through which the scalar meson couples to the vector meson via the n - n loop is given by    _ ( q_0,|q| ) & = & 2i g_s g_v [ g(k ) _",
    "g(k+q ) ] . [ pim ] where 2 is an isospin factor and",
    "the vertex for v - nn coupling is : _",
    "= _ - _ q^  .",
    "[ vertex ] @xmath20 is the in - medium nucleon propagator @xcite .",
    "@xmath6-@xmath7 mixing opens up a new channel for dilepton production in dense and hot nuclear matter : @xmath21 , accessible through n - n excitations .",
    "the feynman diagram for this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] .",
    "similarly , the contribution for @xmath22 can be evaluated from a diagram obtained from that in fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] by replacing one of the incoming @xmath8 s by @xmath23 and by performing the following substitutions : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "once we obtain the relevant cross - section for the dilepton production channel , the thermal production rate of the lepton pairs ( number of reactions per unit time , per unit volume @xmath26 ) can be estimated in the independent particle approximation of relativistic kinetic theory :    = f_1(*k*_1 ) f_2(*k*_2 ) ( s , m^2)v_rel [ rate1 ] where @xmath27 are the thermal distributions of the 1,2  species and @xmath28 with @xmath29 is the triangle function .",
    "[ fig : spectra75 ] shows the total dilepton yield with the combined effect of mixing in the isoscalar and isovector channels .",
    "we have chosen conditions that are representative of collisions to occur at the gsi , and we show the pion and kaon annihilation channels separately .",
    "it is important to see that rates induced by the mixing can be significant in certain windows of density and temperature . particularly , mixing induces a higher yield of dileptons in the invariant mass region between the @xmath6 and @xmath1 peaks , and is strongly density dependent .",
    "the mixing in the isoscalar channel contribute essentially at the @xmath5 peak .",
    "annihilation channel should treat the @xmath30 and the @xmath31wave annihilation coherently .",
    "the interference effects have been found to be negligible . ] on the other hand , the isovector channel seems to provide a better probe as it contributes in the tail region of the two pion annihilation contribution .",
    "it should be stressed here that broadening or dropping @xmath6 meson mass would even favour our observation . in that case",
    "the @xmath8-@xmath8 background would be pushed more towards lower invariant mass region bringing the @xmath7 peak into a clearer relief .",
    "importantly , the upcoming hades experiment @xcite has the necessary resolution , and will operate in the appropriate energy regime to adequately investigate the physics discussed here .",
    "at zero temperature , diagrams in qed that contain a fermion loop with an odd number of photon vertices are cancelled by an equal and opposite contribution coming from the same diagram with fermion lines running in the opposite direction ( furry s theorem @xcite ) .",
    "this statement can also be generalized to qcd for processes with two gluons and an odd number of photon vertices .    at finite",
    "temperature and density , the corresponding quantity to consider in connection with furry s theorem is @xmath32 where @xmath33 = 1/t , @xmath34 is a chemical potential , and @xmath35 is an electromagnetic gauge field operator . here , the effect of the charge conjugation operator @xmath36 is such that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a state in the ensemble with the same number of antiparticles as there are particles in @xmath39 and vice - versa .",
    "if @xmath40 , upon multiple insertions of the unit operator @xmath41 we get    @xmath42    the sum over all states will contain the mirror term @xmath43 and furry s theorem still holds .    however , if @xmath44 ( unequal number of particles and antiparticles ) , then @xmath45 the mirror term this time is @xmath46 , with a different thermal weight .",
    "thus @xmath47 one may say that the medium , being charged , manifestly breaks charge conjugation invariance and these green s functions are thus finite and will lead to the appearance of new processes in a perturbative expansion . again , the appearance of processes that can be related to symmetry breaking in a medium has been noted before @xcite .",
    "let us now focus our attention on the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ 2vert ] for the case of two gluons and a photon attached to a quark loop . such a process does not exist at zero temperature or even at finite temperature and zero density . at finite density",
    "this leads to a new source of dileptons : @xmath48 . in order to obtain the full matrix element",
    "one must coherently sum contributions from both diagrams which have fermion number running in opposite directions .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath49 are    @xmath50 \\frac{d^{3}q}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } tr [ \\gamma^{\\mu } \\gamma^{\\beta } \\gamma^{\\rho }   \\gamma^{\\delta } \\gamma^{\\nu } \\gamma^{\\alpha } ]    \\frac{(q+p - k)_{\\alpha } q_{\\beta }   ( q+p)_{\\delta } } { ( q+p - k)^{2 } q^{2 } ( q+p)^{2 } } , \\nonumber \\ ] ]    @xmath51 \\frac{d^{3}q}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } tr [ \\gamma^{\\nu } \\gamma^{\\delta } \\gamma^{\\rho }   \\gamma^{\\beta } \\gamma^{\\mu } \\gamma^{\\alpha } ]   \\frac{(q+k - p)_{\\alpha } q_{\\beta }   ( q - p)_{\\delta } } { ( q+k - p)^{2 } q^{2 } ( q - p)^{2}}\\ , \\label{2g1p } \\ ] ]    and they involve a trace over colour matrices , and a sum over matsubara frequencies .    again note that the extension of furry s theorem to finite temperature does not hold at finite density : if we set @xmath52 we note that @xmath53 and as a result @xmath54 . of course",
    ", if we now let the chemical potential go to zero ( @xmath55 ) we note that for the transformation @xmath52 we obtain @xmath56 and thus @xmath57 .",
    "the analysis for fermion loops with larger number of vertices is essentially the same .      to calculate the contribution made by the diagram of fig .",
    "[ 2vert ] to the dilepton spectrum emanating from a quark gluon plasma we calculate the imaginary part of the photon self - energy containing the above diagram as an effective vertex ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we calculate in the limit of photon three momentum @xmath58 .",
    "the imaginary part of the considered self energy contains various cuts .",
    "we concentrate solely on the cut that represents the process of gluon - gluon to @xmath59 .",
    "this is a new process which to our knowledge has not been discussed before .",
    "the other possible cuts represent essentially finite density contributions to other known processes of dilepton production .",
    "the differential production rate for pairs of massless leptons with total energy @xmath60 and and total momentum @xmath58 is given in terms of the discontinuity in the photon self - energy @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath61 born process as a baseline .",
    "the initial temperatures of the plasma formed at rhic and lhc have been estimated to lie in the range from 300 - 800 mev @xcite . for this exploratory calculation",
    "we use a conservative estimate of @xmath62 . to evaluate the effect of a finite chemical potential",
    "we perform the calculation with two extreme values of chemical potential @xmath63 ( 1st plot in fig .",
    "[ mu ] ) and @xmath64(2nd plot fig .",
    "[ mu ] ) @xcite .",
    "the calculation , is performed for three massless flavours of quarks .",
    "the differential rate for the production of dileptons with an invariant mass from 0.5 to @xmath65 is presented . on purpose , we avoid regions where the gluons become very soft . in the plots ,",
    "the dashed line is the rate from tree level @xmath66 ; the solid line is that from the process @xmath67 .",
    "we note that in both cases the gluon - gluon process dominates at low energy and dies out at higher energy leaving the @xmath66 process dominant .",
    "importantly , the crossing point lies near the continuum between the @xmath1 and the @xmath68 , raising an optimistic prospect for the successful detection of the new contribution .",
    "we have considered the lepton pair signature of symmetry breaking effects in two different energy regimes .",
    "those effects are present in finite density media that break charge conjugation invariance .",
    "they vanish identically in vacuum , are therefore genuine in - medium manifestations , and are a testimony to the richness of the many - body problem .",
    "theoretical refinements are needed before truly quantitative predictions can be made . in the lower energy sector , many - body theory has to be introduced in order to consistently extend the current vector meson spectral densities to include meson mixing effects @xcite . at higher energies ,",
    "we have begun a study of the effects of hard thermal loop resummation @xcite .",
    "finally , our rates will be inserted in appropriate dynamical models .",
    "as those works are in progress , it is stimulating to note that the signals discussed in this work are all accessible to the new generation of lepton pair measurements ."
