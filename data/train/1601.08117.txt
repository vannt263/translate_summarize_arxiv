    "the characterization of nonlinear systems and the development of appropriate processing algorithms forms a problem for engineering tasks like signal processing or system identification while the increasing demand on low - cost , energy - efficient and fast measurement devices makes it inevitable to operate such systems outside their linear regime . in order to provide high processing accuracy under these circumstances , it is important to investigate nonlinear models and to develop generic approaches and methods for such kind of problems .",
    "the key challenge for efficient solutions to nonlinear measurement problems lies in the fact that access to an appropriate model @xmath0 is required . in theory",
    ", this probabilistic description establishes the statistical relationship of the system parameter @xmath1 and the output measurement @xmath2 .",
    "this allows to formulate efficient signal processing algorithms and to describe the achievable performance by analytical tools .",
    "however , in practice the system model @xmath0 is rarely known exactly and therefore has to be established by numerical calculations or approximated by physical measurements .",
    "if the analytical form of the system model @xmath0 is known but to complicated to work with , one can resort to an direct approximation of the distribution function like performed in @xcite for the rician model .",
    "when the nonlinear output is a parametric but deterministic transformation @xmath3 of an intermediate variable @xmath4 with known statistical model @xmath5 , the input - to - output relation @xmath6 can be represented by a taylor expansion @xcite .",
    "if the input to the nonlinear system is gaussian , the model can be approximated through a bussgang decomposition @xcite , where the idea is to use the best linear approximation of the nonlinearity and to characterize the second moment of the resulting error .",
    "in the situation where the output model is completely unknown one has to use empirical methods like histograms @xcite . in the case",
    "that the system parameter only modulates the output mean and leaves the variance constant , it is possible to use a pessimistic replacement strategy by assuming an equivalent gaussian model .",
    "this becomes possible as for such a situation the gaussian model is the least favorable distribution @xcite .",
    "the method of exponential replacement and subsequent model matching that is presented on the following pages can be interpreted as a generalization of the gaussian replacement strategy .",
    "this replacement can be extended to any distribution of the exponential type , where the gathered measurements are used to estimate the sufficient statistics and model matching is used to determine the natural parameters of the selected exponential distribution . by using the cauchy - schwarz inequality",
    "we show that such an replacement @xmath7 in general exhibits a lower fisher information measure than the original system model @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss how to match the exponential replacement model @xmath7 in an estimation theoretic sense by maximizing its fisher information .",
    "the result of the presented procedure is an approximation of the statistical system model which can be obtained in a measurement - driven way and is guaranteed to be conservative with respect to the possible accuracy that can be obtained by gathering data from @xmath0 to measure the parameter @xmath8 without bias . in order to demonstrate the useful character of the exponential replacement , we show how to evaluate the estimation theoretic quality of three nonlinear systems by calibrated measurements at the system output .",
    "we use the saleh model @xcite to simulate an amplification device with saturation effects and unknown input power level . as a second example we use the rician model with unknown distance parameter , which is of interest in wireless communications @xcite and biomedical applications like fmri @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss a polynomial input - to - output relation of cubic order with unknown regression parameter which exhibits the properties of a wiener type of nonlinear system @xcite .",
    "consider the problem of measuring the system parameter @xmath8 by taking measurements at the output @xmath9 of a system .",
    "the system is represented by a parametrized probability density or mass function @xmath0 , with random variable @xmath10 and a deterministic system parameter @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the support of the random output @xmath9 and @xmath13 the parameter space of @xmath8 . throughout our discussion",
    "we assume that all integrands are absolutely integrable on the support @xmath14 .",
    "all density or mass functions @xmath0 exhibit regularity and are differentiable with respect to the parameter @xmath8 . for such systems",

    "therefore , the fisher information measure provides a mathematical tool in order to evaluate the asymptotic estimation theoretic quality of the model @xmath0 . the higher the actual value of the information measure @xmath21 , the higher the accuracy that can be expected while estimating @xmath20 .",
    "however , calculation of requires an analytic description of the log - likelihood function @xmath22 and its derivative @xmath23 , referred to as the score function .",
    "further , the computation of the integral in can be demanding .",
    "this motivates the problem of finding approximations for @xmath21 which has found our attention for the design of quantized signal processing systems @xcite and allows to deduce a pessimistic but highly tractable replacement @xmath7 for the original model @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "our approach follows the idea of replacing the original system @xmath0 by an equivalent distribution @xmath7 which belongs to the exponential family .",
