    "this makes it well - suited for studying defects , adsorbates , or nanostructures . for studying magnetism , x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) spectroscopy , based on exploring the energy - dependence of the difference in the absorption of left- and right - circularly polarized x - rays in a magnetized sample , proved to be a very powerful tool.@xcite",
    "an efficient use of x - ray absorption spectroscopy requires a significant input from theory . _",
    "ab initio _ calculations of x - ray absorption near - edge structure ( xanes ) and xmcd are usually quite successful in reproducing the positions of spectral peaks , fairly successful in reproducing their intensities and less successful in reproducing detailed shapes of the peaks .",
    "the severity of the failures of the theory varies depending on what material is studied , which absorption edges are involved and what purpose the spectroscopic measurement serves .",
    "magnetic 3@xmath0  elements are often used in artificial structures to form materials with properties that are interesting both fundamentally and for their possible technological application .",
    "xas at the _ l@xmath1 _",
    "edges  of fe , co , and ni is used to get information about electronic states of the @xmath0  character , which dominate close to the fermi energy @xmath4 . _",
    "ab initio _ calculations based on the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) to density functional theory suffer here from some common deficiencies .",
    "one such deficiency is the inability to reproduce correctly the ratio of the intensities of the @xmath2  and @xmath3  white lines in the xanes .",
    "this has been ascribed to the lack of proper dynamic treatment of the core hole.@xcite other common deficiencies of _ ab - initio _ calculations include lack of asymmetry of the theoretical xanes white line and underestimated the ratio of the @xmath2  and @xmath3  xmcd peak intensities.@xcite having an _ ab - initio _ method able to deliver a more accurate quantitative agreement with experiment would be a great help when dealing with complex systems . the procedurally simple xmcd sum rules@xcite proved to be very powerful in interpreting experiments but their use has limitations .",
    "a more robust way is to compare measured spectra to spectra of a well - defined reference material .",
    "the properties of the reference material may , nevertheless , differ from the properties of the investigated system and , moreover , a suitable reference may not be available .",
    "in such situations , a comparison with accurate and reliable calculations may be very useful.@xcite    even though the 3@xmath0  transition metal ( tm ) elements can be seen as moderately correlated materials , there are known effects where including correlations is necessary .",
    "e.g. , the orbital magnetic moment  is underestimated by the lsda and improved results can be obtained by accounting for the enhancement of the orbital polarization either via the scheme of brooks ( op brooks)@xcite or via the lsda+@xmath5  scheme.@xcite these schemes , however , account only for static effects of the electron self - energy . to describe the spectra , dynamical effects",
    "should be included as well .",
    "this can be achieved via the lsda plus dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) scheme .",
    "the lsda+dmft  formalism proved to be rather successful when dealing with the photoemission spectra of 3@xmath0  transition metals ( tms).@xcite one can , therefore , expect that this formalism might lead to a substantial improvement also for xanes and xmcd spectra .",
    "in particular , as the lsda+dmft  method provides correct values for , @xcite one can presuppose that it should also lead to a better ratio of the @xmath2  and @xmath3  xmcd peak intensities because these are , within certain considerations , related to .@xcite    this paper reports on an application of the lsda+dmft  formalism to x - ray absorption spectroscopy focusing on the _ l@xmath1 _",
    "edge  spectra of fe , co , and ni .",
    "we demonstrate that accounting for the valence - band and conduction - band correlations via the lsda+dmft  improves the calculated spectra with respect to the lsda .",
    "however , the improvement still does not lead to a fully satisfying reproduction of the experimental data  not even if the core hole is included via the final state approximation . based on these results ,",
    "we conclude that dealing with the dynamical aspects of the correlations between the core hole and the valence and conduction electrons is needed for further investigations .",
    "a detailed description of the implementation of the lsda+dmft  within the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) band structure scheme can be found in previous publications.@xcite accordingly , we summarize here just the major features .",
    "the lsda+dmft  method belongs to hubbard-@xmath5 band - structure schemes , i.e. , the one - electron lsda hamiltonian is extended by an additional hubbard - hamiltonian term which explicitly describes the on - site interaction between ( in our case ) the @xmath0 electrons .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian is specified by parameters representing the coulomb matrix elements .",
    "the main idea of the dmft is to map the periodic many - body problem onto an effective single - impurity problem that has to be solved self consistently . for this purpose",
    "one describes the electronic properties of the system in terms of the single particle green s function @xmath6 , which is determined by @xmath7 \\hat g = \\hat 1 \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the complex energy , @xmath9  is the lsda hamiltonian and @xmath10 is a single - site effective self - energy operator . within the dmft ,",
    "the self - energy @xmath11 is a solution of the many - body problem of an impurity placed in an effective medium .",
    "this medium is described by the so called _ bath _ green s function @xmath12 connected to the green s function @xmath6 by @xmath13 for a more detailed description of the dmft equations the authors redirect the reader to one of the excellent reviews.@xcite    the self - energy @xmath11 and the bath green s function @xmath14 have to be determined self consistently .",
    "technically , this is done in two steps .",
    "the first step is solving eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) by the means of spin - polarized fully relativistic kkr band structure method.@xcite we relied on the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) to the potential and used an angular momentum cut - off =3 . the integration over the @xmath15 points was done on a regular mesh , using 2600 points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone in the case of bcc fe and fcc ni and 900 points in the case of hcp co. the vosko , wilk , and nusair parametrization for the local exchange and correlation potential was used.@xcite    in the second step of the lsda+dmft  calculation , the self - energy @xmath16 has to be found according to eq .",
    "( [ bath ] ) .",
    "this is done by solving the many - body effective impurity problem , often referred to as the dmft solver.@xcite we used perturbative solvers , either the spin - polarized @xmath17-matrix + flex solver@xcite or the spin - polarized @xmath17-matrix approximation solver ( tma).@xcite the use of perturbative solvers is justified because the correlation effects in pure 3@xmath0 tms are not very pronounced .",
    "the results are very similar for both solvers .",
    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , data for the tma solver are shown here .",
    "for the intra - atomic hund exchange interaction @xmath18  we take a common value of @xmath18=0.9  ev.@xcite the screened on - site coulomb interaction @xmath5 is set to 1.7  ev for fe , 2.3  ev for co , and 2.8  ev for ni .",
    "these values were chosen because they lead to good values of  and  ( see chadov _",
    "et al._@xcite for an extensive study ) and also to a correct description of angular resolved photoemission spectra.@xcite similar values of @xmath5 and @xmath18 were used also by other authors dealing with these systems,@xcite even though it should be noted that the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath18 are not directly transferable from one work to another because they depend , among others , on the choice of the basis set.@xcite    our implementation of the lsda+dmft  method is self - consistent not only in the self - energy  but also in the charge density @xmath19 , i.e. , in each iteration a new potential is used to generate a new single particle green s function @xmath20  entering eq .",
    "( [ bath ] ) . during the self - consistency cycle ,",
    "the self - energy  is calculated either on a set of matsubara frequencies ( flex solver ) or on the real energy axis ( tma solver ) . when calculating x - ray absorption spectra , the self - energy on the real axis above @xmath4 is obtained via the pad analytic continuation.@xcite    the lsda accounts already to some extent for the correlation of the @xmath0 electrons , so a corresponding term has to be subtracted , to avoid counting this interaction twice .",
    "the exact form of this `` double counting term '' is not available because the lsda is not formulated in a diagrammatic language ; the choice has to be made by an educated guess .",
    "one way of doing this is to make _ a priori _ assumptions about the occupation of the correlated orbitals . in the limit of a uniform occupancy of these orbitals ,",
    "the energy correction to the lsda is due to `` fluctuations '' away from the spin - dependent orbitally averaged occupation . the interaction term in this around mean - field ( amf ) limit is@xcite @xmath21 in the above equation , @xmath22 is the occupation number for electrons with orbital and spin quantum numbers @xmath23  and @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the orbitally averaged occupation number and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are matrix elements defined by the parameters @xmath5  and @xmath18 .",
    "the opposite limiting case concerning the occupation of the orbitals is the around atomic limit ( aal ) , which produces the correct behavior if @xmath22=0 or 1 .",
    "it is sometimes referred to as the fully localized limit ( fll ) and the corresponding interaction term is@xcite @xmath28 the results of the lsda+@xmath5  or lsda+dmft  calculations may strongly depend on the choice of the double counting ( d.c . )",
    "procedure . based on earlier works , especially in the field of photoemission",
    ", it appears that the amf recipe is the most appropriate for the 3@xmath0 tms .",
    "@xcite it is interesting to see whether this recipe works also for x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) .",
    "we investigate also the effect of the core hole treated within the final state approximation as fully relaxed and screened , i.e. , with the potential calculated with one electron transferred from the 2@xmath29  core level into the valence band .",
    "this was achieved by first performing a self - consistent calculation without the core hole and then by treating the photoabsorbing atom with the core hole as a perturbation , employing the impurity cluster green s function method.@xcite in this impurity calculation the electronic structure was allowed to relax within the first two nearest - neighbor atomic shells around the photoabsorbing atom .",
    "the theoretical spectra were broadened to account for the finite lifetimes of the core hole and of the photoelectron .",
    "the core hole related broadening was simulated by a lorentzian with full width at half maxima of 0.40  ev at the @xmath2  edge and 0.70  ev at the @xmath3  edge , which is in the range of generally accepted values.@xcite the excited photoelectron related broadening was simulated by a lorentzian with energy - dependent width , according to the `` universal curve '' as suggested by mller _",
    "et al._@xcite by optimizing the broadening along the suggestion of benfatto",
    "_ et al._@xcite a better visual agreement of our calculations with experiment could be achieved .",
    "however , this would have no influence on the conclusions .",
    "intuitive understanding as well as quantitative analysis of xmcd spectra has been greatly helped by the xmcd sum rules .",
    "these rules associate areas of xanes and xmcd peaks with  and  of the photoabsorbing atom .",
    "our calculations provide  and  as well as xanes and xmcd spectra .",
    "accordingly , application of the sum rules to our calculated spectra makes it possible to assess to what extent the changes in the spectra caused by including the valence- and conduction - band correlations via the lsda+dmft  are consistent with the corresponding changes in the magnetic moments .",
    "for the _ l@xmath1 _",
    "edge  spectra the sum rules can be written as @xcite @xmath30 and @xmath31 where are the differences between the absorption coefficients for the left and right circularly polarized light at the @xmath3 and @xmath2 edges , @xmath32  is the integrated isotropic absorption spectrum , @xmath33  and @xmath34  are the @xmath0  components of the local spin and orbital magnetic moments , @xmath35  is the number of holes in the @xmath0  band and @xmath36  is the @xmath0  component of the intra - atomic magnetic dipole operator for spin quantization axis aligned along @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath36  term is negligible for high - symmetry systems as those dealt with here .",
    "however , this does not necessarily apply to more complex systems.@xcite application of the sum rules ( [ eq - spin])([eq - orb ] ) requires setting the energy cut - off @xmath38  which defines the upper boundary of the 3@xmath0  band .",
    "we determined it by requiring that the integrated density of the @xmath0  states is 10 when integrated from the bottom of the valence band up to @xmath38 , similar as in our earlier study.@xcite",
    "the bulk - like fe , co , and ni films were grown _ in situ _ directly at the synchrotron radiation facility bessy ii ( berlin , germany ) . as the substrate a cu(100 ) single crystal was used and the films were prepared at room temperature in ultra high vacuum conditions ( base pressure @xmath39 mbar ) by evaporation from high purity rods using a commercial triple e@xmath40-beam evaporator .",
    "the surface of the cu crystal was cleaned by several cycles of ar@xmath41 bombardment and annealing at @xmath17=900 k. the deposition rates were in the regime of 1    per minute .",
    "the cu(100 ) single crystal and the films were characterized by means of low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and auger - electron spectroscopy ( aes ) .",
    "the thickness of the ferromagnetic films was calibrated by aes and by the signal - to - background ratio ( edge jump ) at the respective @xmath42-edges .",
    "the thickness of the fe film was 50 monolayers ( ml ) , and was 20 ml for the co and ni films .",
    "the experimental data have been obtained accounting for saturation effects , and the xmcd spectra have been corrected to correspond to 100  % circular polarization and collinear orientation of the photon @xmath15-vector and the magnetization .",

    "[ fig - flav ] reveals further that the calculated spectra split into two groups , according to whether the _ dynamic effects _ to the self - energy have been included ( lsda+dmft  calculations ) or not ( lsda and lsda+@xmath5  calculations ) .",

    "the choice of the d.c .  model has thus only a minor influence on the shapes of xanes and xmcd spectra .",

    "the changes in the xanes and xmcd spectra which result from the inclusion the @xmath0  band correlations are not very pronounced .",
    "one may ask to what degree are the changes significant at all : do they really reflect the different treatment of the correlations ?",
    "the significance of the changes in the spectra can be assessed by comparing them with the changes of the ground - state properties .",
    "a suitable quantity in this respect is the  ratio , as it is underestimated by the plain lsda while it is correctly described by the lsda+dmft  method . by applying the xmcd sum rules ( [ eq - spin])([eq - orb ] ) to the theoretical spectrum",
    ", the ratio between the @xmath0  components of the magnetic moments , , can be obtained and compared to the  ratio obtained directly from the ground - state electronic structure .",

    "the differences between spectra calculated by different ways of dealing with the many body effects are thus relevant and consistent . even relatively small changes in the intensities of xmcd peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra ] correspond to large changes in , as can be seen in tab .",
    "[ tab - mag ] .",
    "the failure of the lsda to reproduce the ratio of the @xmath2/@xmath3  xmcd peak intensities thus can not be a simple consequence of the failure of the lsda to yield correct orbital moments .",

    "[ fig - spectra ] ) . a better agreement with experiment",
    "could presumably be obtained if the core hole was accounted for .",
    "this is quite a complicated task within the _ ab initio _ scheme .",
    "a technically relatively simple way of achieving this is via the `` static '' final state approximation ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - comput ] ) . for the @xmath43  edges",
    ", such a scheme sometimes improves the xanes ( e.g. , for the zn edge in znse@xcite or for the si edge in quartz)@xcite while sometimes it has only a minor effect ( early transition metals).@xcite however , the final state approximation need not work for the _",
    "l@xmath1 _",
    "edges  which involve transitions to semi - localized @xmath0  states : by promoting a 2@xmath29  electron into the valence states one may effectively fill the @xmath0  band of the photoabsorbing atom , suppressing to a large extent the intensity of the white line .",

    "for fe , we observe an increase of the ratio of intensities of the @xmath2  and @xmath3  xmcd peaks , in agreement with experiment . for co , the final state approximation produces only minor changes with respect to the ground state calculations . for ni , however , including the core hole via the final state approximation substantially worsens the agreement with experiment  the xas white lines as well as the prominent xmcd peaks practically disappear !",
    "a similar situation occurs if the final state approximation is applied over the plain lsda ( therefore , only the lsda+dmft  results are shown here ) .",
    "we tested this scheme also by using a half - filled core hole , i.e. , employing the slater transition state method .",
    "sometimes this procedure works well for the @xmath43  edge spectra.@xcite satisfying results were also reported for the cu @xmath2  edge xanes.@xcite in our case , however , the slater transition state method does not bring any substantial improvement  the results just lie approximately half - way between the results obtained without a core hole and with a full core hole , so they are not shown here .",
    "our results demonstrate that the final state approximation is unsuitable for describing the _ l@xmath1 _  edge  xas in late 3@xmath0  tms .",
    "this applies for calculations based on the plain lsda as well as on the lsda+dmft  method .",
    "our goal was to find out whether the differences commonly occurring between the experimental _ l@xmath1 _  edge  xanes and xmcd spectra of 3@xmath0  transition metals on the one hand and _ ab - initio _ calculations on the other hand are mainly due to the way the lsda deals with the correlations . by performing the lsda+dmft  calculations",
    ", we found that if valence- and conduction - band correlations are included , the spectra change in the right direction with respect to the plain lsda . in particular , the lsda+dmft  yields asymmetric @xmath2 xas white lines . the improvement is , however , rather incremental than dramatic . the ratio of the intensities of the @xmath2  and @xmath3  xas and xmcd peaks is not significantly improved by the lsda+dmft  formalism .",
    "the changes in the intensities of the xmcd peaks are , nevertheless , consistent with the changes of the  ratio as suggested by the xmcd sum rules .",
    "when the core hole is additionally accounted for within the final state approximation , the agreement between theory and experiment generally does not improve ( in the case of ni , it substantially worsens ) .",
    "it appears , therefore , that to get a decisive improvement of _ ab - initio _ calculations of the _ l@xmath1 _",
