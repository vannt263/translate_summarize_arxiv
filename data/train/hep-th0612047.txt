    "bogomolny - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) monopoles have long been of considerable interest ( for reviews , see @xcite ) , and recently have found a new interpretation in the context of d - branes .",
    "this d - brane connection is partly responsible for a particular interest in periodic assemblages of monopoles .",
    "for example , there have been studies of monopole chains @xcite , where the underlying theory ( such as the nahm transform ) is well - developed .",
    "however , for monopole sheets or walls , where the fields are doubly - periodic , much less is known .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the ( essentially abelian ) homogeneous solution on @xmath0 may be viewed as a monopole sheet , and there is a sense in which such an interpretation is meaningful . if , however , one constructs a sheet of dirac monopoles , as a double series , then the resulting field looks rather different . the purpose of this note is to present numerical evidence for the existence of an su(2 ) monopole sheet which is a smoothed - out version of the dirac sheet . as we shall see",
    ", it resembles a domain wall between a vacuum region and a region of homogeneous phase with constant energy density .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the usual position vector in @xmath0 , and let @xmath2 be the square lattice in the @xmath3-plane consisting of points of the form @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "suppose we place a unit - charge dirac monopole at each site of this lattice .",
    "the resulting magnetic field is , at least formally , @xmath6 where @xmath7 . the component @xmath8 is a positive series which converges absolutely , and the other two components @xmath9 and @xmath10 are conditionally convergent ( except , of course , at the points of @xmath2 , where @xmath11 is singular ) . for fixed @xmath12",
    ", we have @xmath13 as @xmath14 ; this was checked by numerical summation of the series , and can also be established by a rough analytic approximation .    similarly , we may obtain a gauge potential @xmath15 by taking a gauge potential for each monopole and summing these ; for example , @xmath16 which is valid in the region @xmath17 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of ( [ diracpotential ] ) is @xmath18 as @xmath19 .    in general ,",
    "if we have a doubly - periodic vector field @xmath11 which is smooth for @xmath20 , then we can define its charge @xmath21 by @xmath22 by continuity , @xmath23 do not change if @xmath24 is increased .",
    "if @xmath11 is genuinely a doubly - periodic magnetic field , in other words if its gauge potential @xmath25 is doubly - periodic up to a gauge transformation , then @xmath26 and @xmath27 will both be integers : this is the dirac quantization condition for a magnetic field on the torus @xmath28 .",
    "the field ( [ diracfield ] ) , in view of its asymptotic behaviour , clearly has charge @xmath29 , and so it does not quite satisfy this quantization condition .",
    "( of course , taking an array of monopoles of charge 2 would have the effect of multiplying all the expressions by 2 , and so this would give a genuinely doubly - periodic magnetic field . )",
    "another example of a ` half - doubly - periodic ' field is the homogeneous solution @xmath30 which has charge is @xmath31 .",
    "if we add ( [ dirachomog ] ) to ( [ diracfield ] ) , then we obtain a doubly - periodic magnetic field of charge @xmath32 , with @xmath33 this is the prototype of our monopole sheet : it separates a vacuum region with energy density approximately zero ( for @xmath34 ) , from a region of homogeneous phase with energy density approximately constant ( for @xmath35 ) . in what follows",
    ", we will show that it has a non - abelian version in which the singularities are smoothed out .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath37 denote an su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs field , and define @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath39)$ ] , as usual .",
    "we impose the global conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are @xmath42 anti - hermitian trace - free matrices , and are smooth on @xmath0 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are periodic in both @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( actually periodic , not merely up to a gauge transformation ) , with unit periods .",
    "in addition , we need boundary conditions as @xmath14 , and these can be formulated as follows . if the restriction @xmath45 is nowhere - zero ( as a function of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , then the normalized higgs field @xmath46 is well - defined , and is a map from the torus @xmath28 to the 2-sphere @xmath47 . here",
    "so @xmath49 has a degree ( winding number ) @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath51 is nowhere - zero for @xmath52 , then by continuity the degree @xmath53 is independent of @xmath54 , and is denoted @xmath27 ; similarly for @xmath26 .",
    "the boundary condition , motivated by the u(1 ) case , is :    1 .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 as @xmath19 ; if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is bounded , as @xmath19 ; if @xmath60 , then @xmath61 and @xmath62 as @xmath19 ; and similarly as @xmath63 .",
    "we say that such a field has charge @xmath64 .    for fields satisfying conditions ( a)(c ) , there is a topological lower bound on the energy .",
    "the derivation of this is analogous to the one used for monopoles localized in @xmath0 . in order to get finite energy ,",
    "we need to restrict to a finite cylinder @xmath65 ; the condition ( c ) is adapted in the obvious way to become a condition at @xmath66 .",
    "the energy density is @xmath67.\\ ] ] the first observation is that @xmath68\\,dx\\,dy,\\ ] ] which is a standard calculation @xcite .",
    "the energy is @xmath69 assuming for simplicity that @xmath70 , and using stokes s theorem , this leads to the inequality @xmath71 with equality if and only if the bogomolny equations @xmath72 are satisfied .",
    "there is an exact solution of ( [ bogeqn ] ) representing a field of charge @xmath73  in other words , with @xmath74 .",
    "this is obtained @xcite by embedding the homogeneous abelian field ( [ dirachomog ] ) , multiplied by a factor of -2 , into su(2 ) : @xmath75 and then applying an su(2 ) gauge transformation ( which it is not hard to write down explicitly ) , in order to make the fields periodic .",
    "the energy density of ( [ nonabhomog ] ) is easily read off , and is @xmath76 ; so the bogomolny bound ( [ bogbound ] ) is saturated , as expected .",
    "the problem is to investigate whether there is a su(2 ) solution of the bogomolny equations ( [ bogeqn ] ) with charge @xmath32  and to see what it looks like .",
    "no existence theorem is currently available , and the best that can be done here is to use a numerical approach . the idea is to discretize the system as a lattice gauge theory , and to minimize the energy @xmath77 numerically . a minimum which saturates the lower bound ( [ bogbound ] ) , in other words with @xmath78 , should then be a solution .",
    "so we replace @xmath0 , or rather the region @xmath79\\times(0,1]\\times[-l , l]$ ] , with a cubic @xmath80 lattice @xmath81 , so the lattice spacing is @xmath82 .",
    "the gauge potential is represented , in the standard way , by assigning an element @xmath83 of su(2 ) to each link of @xmath81 ; the curvature is then an element @xmath84 of su(2 ) associated with each face .",
    "we represent the higgs field by assigning an element @xmath85 of su(2 ) to each site of @xmath81 ; the covariant derivatives @xmath86 are then elements of su(2 ) associated with each link .",
    "the energy is given by the ` wilson action ' @xmath87 which is gauge - invariant on the lattice .",
    "the boundary conditions , which are also gauge - invariant , are as follows :    * at @xmath88 , we impose @xmath89 ; * at @xmath90 , we impose @xmath91 .    these correspond , respectively , to the conditions @xmath92 at @xmath88 , and @xmath93 at @xmath90 , in the continuum version .",
    "the initial configuration was constructed by starting with the lattice version of the homogeneous solution , namely @xmath94 then gauge - transforming so as to make these periodic ; and finally adjusting by setting @xmath95 for @xmath96 , and interpolating so that @xmath97 and @xmath98 go to @xmath99 as @xmath54 goes from @xmath100 to @xmath101 .",
    "the resulting lattice field has charge @xmath32 .    starting with this initial configuration",
    ", the energy ( [ wilson ] ) was minimized using a conjugate - gradient method , while maintaining the boundary conditions ( and also , of course , the condition that @xmath83 and @xmath85 should be su(2)-valued ) .",
    "this was done for various values of @xmath102 ( or equivalently @xmath103 ) and @xmath104 . for @xmath105 ,",
    "the results are already of high accuracy , in the sense that the value of @xmath77 at its minimum is within @xmath106 of the bogomolny bound , and it changes by less than that amount if @xmath102 is increased .    ]",
    "the graphs in figure 1 depict the minimum - energy configuration with @xmath107 ( so the lattice spacing is @xmath108 ) , and @xmath109 .",
    "its lattice energy is @xmath110 .",
    "the upper - left - hand graph shows the topological charge ( winding number ) @xmath111 of @xmath112 , as a function of @xmath54 ; in particular , we see that the solution does indeed have charge @xmath32 .",
    "the norm of the higgs field @xmath41 ( at @xmath113 , and as a function of @xmath54 ) is shown in the upper - right - hand graph ; as expected , it approaches a constant value as @xmath63 , as depends linearly on @xmath54 as @xmath19 .",
    "the lower - left - hand graph shows the energy density @xmath114 ( or rather its lattice version ) summed over @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "we see that the energy density tends to zero as @xmath63 , approaches a constant value as @xmath19 , and is peaked at @xmath115 .",
    "finally , the lower - right - hand subfigure plots the energy density at @xmath116 , as a function of @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for @xmath117 , the corresponding energy plots are essentially constant in @xmath43 and @xmath44 , but at the location of the monopole sheet ( which here is at @xmath115 ) we see the individual monopoles ( one in each fundamental cell of the lattice , of which four are shown ) .",
    "it is straightforward to change the @xmath118-periods by scaling : in fact , if @xmath119 is a solution with unit periods in @xmath43 and @xmath44 , then @xmath120 is a solution with periods @xmath121 .",
    "more generally , it should be possible ( although this has not been investigated ) to construct analogous solutions in which the monopole sheet has a different lattice structure , for example hexagonal .",
    "( compare the case of the skyrme system , where a hexagonal lattice is slightly more energetically favourable than a square lattice @xcite . )    if one takes the gauge group to be so(3 ) rather than su(2 ) , then the topological classification of doubly - periodic monopoles has an additional feature , since so(3 ) bundles over the torus @xmath28 are not necessarily trivial  they are classified by @xmath122 .",
    "essentially , the consequence is that the charges @xmath21 of so(3 ) monopole sheets need not be integers , but may be half - integers .",
    "the simplest example @xcite is the homogeneous solution of charge @xmath31 , analogous to ( [ nonabhomog ] ) , namely @xmath123 which , in effect , lives on a non - trivial so(3 ) bundle over @xmath124 .",
    "there should exist an so(3 ) domain wall solution of charge @xmath125 which is analogous to the charge @xmath32 solution .",
    "more generally , there should exist sheets of charge @xmath126 , where @xmath127 .",
    "if @xmath128 and @xmath129 are distinct , then such a solution represents a wall between two distinct homogeneous phases ; one of these could be the vacuum , if the corresponding charge is zero .",
    "the only ` visible ' parameters in the numerical solution presented above are those corresponding to translations in @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath54 .",
    "( the position of the sheet , which turned out to be at @xmath115 , is in effect set by the boundary condition at @xmath88 : in fact , by the fixed value of @xmath130 at @xmath88 . ) whether there are additional moduli is not known . for the homogeneous solutions",
    ", the moduli can be computed explicitly @xcite : the solutions of charge @xmath131 , with @xmath132 , depend on @xmath133 parameters ; and the perturbations ( normalizable zero - modes ) can be written down explicitly in terms of theta - functions .",
    "( only the @xmath134 case was presented in @xcite , but its generalization to @xmath135 is straightforward . )",
    "this suggests that there might also be additional moduli in the general case of charge @xmath126 .",
    "the main tool in the analysis of bps monopoles has been the nahm transform @xcite .",
    "the general pattern @xcite suggests that the nahm transform of a monopole sheet ( a solution on @xmath124 ) , will be another solution on @xmath124  in other words , that monopole sheets are ` self - reciprocal ' under the nahm transform .",
    "the only current evidence in favour of this comes from the class of homogeneous solutions : the u(1 ) case was described in @xcite , and the su(2 ) case is similar .",
    "solutions ( with prescribed singularities ) of the bogomolny equations on @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a riemann surface and @xmath138 is an interval , crop up in the area of supersymmetric gauge theory and branes ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the context of the present paper is rather different , but the solutions described here could be re - interpreted in d - brane language .",
    "there are many similarities between bps monoples and skyrmions ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in the skyrme system",
    ", there is a wall - like solution analogous to a graphene sheet , and one may view fullerene - like skyrmions as being shells constructed from such sheets @xcite ; in fact , the sheet separates a region of ` skyrmion core ' from the region outside the skyrmion .",
    "the monopole sheet described above appears at first sight to be rather different in nature , since neither side of the wall corresponds to the field outside a bps monopole ( which , of course , is that of a dirac monopole ) .",
    "it may , however , turn out to be relevant as the wall of a magnetic bag @xcite .",
    "to summarize : we have constructed , numerically , a solution of the bogomolny equations representing a sheet of bps monopoles : in general , it is a domain wall between two regions of constant energy density , either of which can be a vacuum region .",
    "note added : i thank the referee for emphasizing that a purely - magnetic wall with vacuum on one side and a nonzero magnetic field on the other , can not be static : it would accelerate in the direction of the magnetic field . in the bps case , by contrast , the pressure on the wall from the higgs field is exactly opposite to the pressure from the magnetic field , and so there is no obvious instability .",
