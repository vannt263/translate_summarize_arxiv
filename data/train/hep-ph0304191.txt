    "in the framework of perturbative qcd , the basic spin - averaged characteristics of heavy flavor hadro- , photo- and electroproduction are known exactly up to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) . during the last ten years",
    ", these nlo results have been widely used for a phenomenological description of available data ( for a review see @xcite ) . at the same time , the key question remains open : how to test the applicability of qcd at fixed order to heavy quark production ?",
    "the problem is twofold . on the one hand ,",
    "the nlo corrections are large ; they increase the leading order ( lo ) predictions for both charm and bottom production cross sections by approximately a factor of two . for this reason",
    ", one could expect that higher - order corrections , as well as nonperturbative contributions , can be essential , especially for the @xmath5-quark case .",
    "on the other hand , it is very difficult to compare pqcd predictions for spin - averaged cross sections with experimental data directly , without additional assumptions , because of a high sensitivity of the theoretical calculations to standard uncertainties in the input qcd parameters .",
    "the total uncertainties associated with the unknown values of the heavy quark mass , @xmath6 , the factorization and renormalization scales , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the parton distribution functions are so large that one can only estimate the order of magnitude of the pqcd predictions for total cross sections at fixed target energies @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the role of higher - order corrections has been extensively investigated in the framework of the soft gluon resummation formalism . for a review see ref.@xcite .",
    "soft gluon ( or threshold ) resummation is based on the factorization properties of the cross section near the partonic threshold and makes it possible to resum to all orders in @xmath10 the leading ( sudakov double ) logarithms ( ll ) and the next - to - leading ones ( nll ) @xcite .",
    "formally resummed cross sections are ill - defined due to the landau pole contribution , and a few prescriptions have been proposed to avoid the renormalon ambiguities @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , numerical predictions for the heavy quark production cross sections can depend significantly on the choice of resummation prescription @xcite .",
    "another open question , also closely related to convergence of the perturbative series , is the role of subleading logarithms which are not , in principle , under control of the resummation procedure @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it is of special interest to study those observables that are well - defined in pqcd .",
    "a nontrivial example of such an observable is proposed in @xcite , where the single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in charm and bottom production by linearly polarized photons , @xmath11 $ ] , was calculated .",
    "it was shown that , contrary to the production cross section , the single spin asymmetry in heavy flavor photoproduction is quantitatively well defined in pqcd : it is stable , both parametrically and perturbatively , and insensitive to nonperturbative corrections .",
    "therefore , measurements of this asymmetry would provide an ideal test of pqcd . as was shown in ref .",
