    "density functional theory ( dft ) is an important tool in computational quantum chemical research@xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that dft offers a good compromise between accuracy and computing time , which allows to investigate large molecules with hundreds of atoms .",
    "the essential ingredient of dft , the exact exchange  correlation functional , is not known . during the last decades",
    ", efforts were made to develop better and better approximations to the exact exchange  correlation functional ( by increasingly advanced analytic anstze and improved reference data sets for their parametrization)@xcite . as a result ,",
    "a plethora of ( approximate ) density functionals is now at our disposal .",
    "unfortunately , there is no truly rigorous way to systematically develop such approximations , and their reliability is assessed in statistical analyses by comparison to reference data sets . as a consequence , a given density functional might provide reasonable or even excellent results in some application , but completely fail in another one .    comparing the values of one or several chemical properties calculated with different density functionals with accurate reference data , obtained either experimentally or by quantum chemical methods of controllable accuracy ( e.g. , coupled cluster@xcite ) , provides a means to measure the quality of these density functionals , at least with respect to the properties studied .",
    "pople and coworkers were among the first to realize the importance of benchmark studies , which they applied to assess the quality of the so - called g1 and g2 composite approaches@xcite . in 1981 , they proposed a comparatively small database containing the atomization energies of 31 small molecules such as lih , ch@xmath7 , co@xmath8 , and h@xmath8nnh@xmath8@xcite .",
    "this database has been continuously extended ; in 1997 , g2/97 was presented which comprised already 148 molecules@xcite , followed by the g3/99 test set with 222 molecules in 1999@xcite . in 2005 ,",
    "the latest revision of this pople benchmarking database was presented ",
    "g3/05 includes a total of 454 reference data points@xcite .",
    "more recently , truhlar and coworkers assembled a large collection of databases including atomization energies , ionization potentials , electron and proton affinities , barrier heights , anharmonic vibrational zero point energies , saddle point geometries , and a broad range of binding energies ( covering systems with hydrogen bonds , charge - transfer complexes , dipole interactions , and weakly interacting systems)@xcite .",
    "this broad range of different properties shall assure a rather complete picture of the performance of a given density functional . in a similar spirit , grimme and korth proposed",
    "`` mindless '' benchmarking relying on a large library of automatically generated `` artificial '' molecules , which should remove any chemical biases@xcite .",
    "goerigk and grimme incorporated this test set into the gmtkn24 database covering main group thermochemistry , kinetics , and noncovalent interactions@xcite , which was recently extended to form the so - called gmtkn30 database@xcite .",
    "a drawback of all of these databases is the fact that the coverage of large transition metal complexes is rather poor .",
    "this deficiency can be significant for practical purposes as coordination chemistry in the condensed phase usually involves complex , spatially extended ligand environments .",
    "by contrast , a compact small diatomic like cr@xmath8 with unsaturated valencies can be a true challenge for electronic structure methods , but it is no prototypical system for coordination chemistry .",
    "while the grimme databases are specifically set up for main group chemistry and do therefore not cover any transition metals , the truhlar databases include some small transition metal compounds like ag@xmath8 , cuoh@xmath9 , fe(co)@xmath10 , ferrocene , and bis(benzene)chromium .",
    "et al . _  developed a database with the heats of formation of 225 molecules containing 3d - transition metals@xcite .",
    "however , most of these molecules are also rather small .",
    "in addition , many of the experimental reference data have a rather large uncertainty , which might result in wrong conclusions as to the performance of a given density functional .",
    "very recently , zhang _ et al .",
    "_  therefore selected the 70 molecules which are estimated to have experimental uncertainties in their enthalpies of formation of at most 2kcalmol@xmath0@xcite and tested no less than 42 density functionals on that database .",
    "however , this reduced dataset again contains only very small compounds ; furthermore , only a minority of them contains organic ligands .",
    "hughes and friesner assembled a rather large database of spin - splittings of 57 octahedral first - row transition metal complexes@xcite .",
    "furche and perdew also presented a database of 3d transition metals , including reaction energies .",
    "again , also this database includes only very small compounds ( and reactions such as the dissociation of the vanadium dimer)@xcite .",
    "by contrast , _ large _ organometallic compounds are key players in important fields such as homogeneous catalysis@xcite .",
    "it is often not possible to draw conclusions from quantum chemical calculations on small complexes for larger compounds .",
    "furthermore , dispersion effects have a much larger influence in bigger complexes .",
    "therefore , a database of reliable values for important chemical properties like ligand dissociation energies for a variety of large transition metal complexes is highly desirable .    for such large complexes , no truly reliable _ ab initio _ computational data are currently available .",
    "therefore , for a functional investigation of large complexes that shall reach beyond a mutual comparison of popular functionals , we have to resort to experimental data .",
    "ideally , these data should not only be accurate but also obtained in the gas phase , such that strong ( environmental ) intermolecular interactions like solvent effects can be excluded .",
    "some of us accurately measured ligand dissociation energies of a broad range of large transition metal complexes in the gas phase by means of tandem mass spectrometry .",
    "the experimental ligand dissociation energies were obtained by injecting the intact complex into a mass spectrometer and letting it subsequently collide with an inert noble gas such as argon or xenon .",
    "this collision led to dissociation of a ligand , and the dissociation cross sections were measured as a function of the nominal collisional energy .",
    "the actual value of the ligand dissociation energy was then determined by monte carlo simulations based on a rather involved model of the entire dissociation process involving the ligand dissociation energy as a fit parameter@xcite .",
    "this procedure assures a sufficient and determinable accuracy of the ligand dissociation energies .",
    "here , we present a database of ten selected ligand dissociation energies from refs .  @xcite and investigate the performance of nine widely used density functionals .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : compmet ] , we introduce our new database of coordination energies ( which we will abbreviate in the following as wccr10 ) , the density functionals investigated , and the computational benchmarking procedure .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ sec : results ] before providing a conclusion together with an outlook in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "our database consists of the ten dissociation reactions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : reactions ] .",
    "these reactions were selected out of all such reactions that have been published so far with the experimental methodology mentioned in the introduction@xcite .",
    "specific care was taken to achieve a good balance of different transition metals and different ligand types .",
    "hence , duplication of similar ligand dissociation reactions has been avoided .",
    "all molecules in this database feature a closed - shell electronic structure .",
    "all transition metal complexes are charged , which is an implication of the fact that the ligand dissociation energies have been determined by mass spectrometry .",
    "overview of the ten reactions of the wccr10 database .",
    "the aromatic substituent abbreviated as `` ar '' is 2,6-c@xmath11h@xmath12cl@xmath8 . ]",
    "table [ tab : reference ] lists the experimental ligand dissociation energies for the ten reactions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : reactions ] .",
    "the error bounds were estimated in the original literature from approximately 10 to 20 regressions with the l - cid program@xcite for three independent data sets .",
    "furthermore , a lab - frame energy uncertainty of 0.15ev was assumed@xcite .",
    "these experimental ligand dissociation energies are based on reaction rates derived within approximate rice",
    " ramsperger  kassel  marcus ( rrkm ) theory and",
    "can therefore be considered to be free energies at 0 kelvin .",
    "therefore , these energies have to be compared to computed total electronic energies which are corrected for their zero - point vibrational energies .    reactions 4 and 5 feature a twofold degeneracy of the reaction paths , i.e. , there are two equivalent pathways to product formation , involving either of the two phosphine ligands for reaction 4 and either of the two platinum - bound methyl groups for reaction 5 .",
    "however , the reported experimental reaction energies@xcite were determined with a version of l - cid@xcite that did not take into account this degeneracy in the microcanonical rrkm treatment of the rates . as a result",
    ", the reaction rates as a function of collision energy have been overestimated by a factor of two , which slightly affects both the kinetic shift treatment and the fitted reaction energies and indirectly , the other fitting parameters .",
    "this typically leads to a minor underestimation of the reaction energies by @xmath133kjmol@xmath0 ( this corresponds well to the 2kjmol@xmath0 difference obtained from the eyring equation , which applies to canonical ensemble rate theory ) . whereas this error is within the experimental uncertainty of the reaction energies",
    ", we decided for the wccr10 set to refit the original experimental data sets with a version of l - cid that does take into account the twofold reaction path degeneracy@xcite .",
    "the new data obtained for reactions 4 and 5 are given in table [ tab : reference ] ( see the supporting information for further details ) .",
    ".[tab : reference]experimental reference values for the ten ligand dissociation energies in the wccr10 database . [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath5 note that for b3lyp - d3 , no data are available for reactions 2 , 3 , 4 , and 9 . for reactions 2 , 3 , and 4 , the other dispersion - corrected density functionals ( bp86-d3 and b97-d - d2 ) have particularly large errors .",
    "we might therefore expect that the values presented in this table would be significantly worse for b3lyp - d3 if these data could be taken into account .    by investigating the mean absolute deviations ( mads ) of the individual functionals ( see table [ tab : errors ] )",
    ", we see that most functionals have mads of about 30kjmol@xmath0 .",
    "the mad of the dispersion - corrected functionals bp86-d3 and b97-d - d2 is clearly larger , which is due to the above - mentioned significant errors in the case of reactions 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "we note again that there is no data available for these reactions for b3lyp - d3 , and we may expect that the mad of the results obtained with this functional would otherwise be significantly larger .",
    "the largest absolute deviation ( lad ) from the experimental values is about 50kjmol@xmath0 for most functionals .",
    "for bp86 the largest deviation is 67kjmol@xmath0 , and for b3lyp it is even as large as 83kjmol@xmath0 . excluding the dispersion - corrected functionals , b3lyp performs worst considering both the mad as well as the largest absolute deviation from experiment . bp86 has a comparable mad , but its lad is significantly better than in the case of b3lyp .",
    "a considerable improvement can be obtained by using the non - empirical pbe functional .",
    "with 32kjmol@xmath0 its mean absolute deviation is about 8kjmol@xmath0 lower than that of bp86 .",
    "the lad is improved by roughly 13kjmol@xmath0 , being about 53kjmol@xmath0 . moving from this gga functional to the non - empirical meta - gga functional tpss",
    ", no further improvement is obtained ; both the mad as well as the lad are almost identical to those of pbe . in the case of these two functionals , admixture of hartree ",
    "fock exchange can further decrease the mean absolute deviations .",
    "in particular for pbe0 , the mad decreases to 27kjmol@xmath0 , which is the lowest value of all density functionals investigated in this work .",
    "however , adding hartree  fock exchange does not generally lead to a reliable description of the ligand dissociation energies , as exemplified by the b3lyp results .",
    "note that in an earlier benchmark study by fuche and perdew@xcite , the tpss and tpssh functionals were found to be best functionals for dipole moments , reaction energies , and harmonic frequencies of 3d transition metal complexes .",
    "still , the best - performing functionals in our study have errors of up to about 50kjmol@xmath0 for certain reactions and thus no functional performs well for our complete wccr10 set . even in a theory - only comparison",
    "the scatter of the calculated results is significant : fig .",
    "[ fig : energies2 ] provides a comparison of deviations in dissociation energy ( with the pbe0 functional chosen as a reference ) .",
    "deviations of dissociation energies calculated with different functionals from those calculated with pbe0 , which has been chosen as a reference . ]      considering again fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] , we note that the energies of reactions 2 , 3 , and 4 calculated with dispersion - corrected functionals deviate from both the experimental values and the values calculated with all other density functionals",
    ". it is therefore appropriate to investigate this aspect in more detail .",
    "grimme s dispersion corrections were parametrized for pairs of atoms in specific valence states within a reference molecule .",
    "as the dispersion coefficients are calibrated against accurate results on neutral systems , this might lead to too large dispersion coefficients for cationic systems .",
    "since there are no anionic counterions present in our study ( the dispersion coefficients of which might then be estimated to be too small ) , there can not be any cancellation of errors as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one might argue that another possible cause for the deviation of dispersion - corrected energies observed here could be rooted in the large size of the complexes studied ( note that the dispersion - corrected functionals perform particularly badly for reactions 2 , 3 , and 4 , which involve the largest compounds of the wccr10 test set ) .",
    "it has been found by tkatchenko and von lilienfeld that for large , bulky molecules ( and even more so for condensed - phase systems ) , three - body interactions must not be neglected@xcite .",
    "this has also been confirmed by risthaus and grimme@xcite .",
    "while it is in principle possible to account for these three - body dispersion effects by means of an axilrod  teller  muto term , this correction is not used by default in grimme s set of dispersion corrections@xcite . in order to assess their magnitude , we calculated the three - body correction term for the structures obtained with the standard d3 dispersion correction .",
    "the resulting values for this three - body correction are very similar for the functionals bp86-d3 , b3lyp - d3 and b97-d - d2 , so that we may focus on the results obtained with bp86-d3 .",
    "we find that the three - body interaction leads in all cases to a repulsive term , thus slightly destabilizing the molecule .",
    "this destabilization is more pronounced the larger the molecules are . for example , in the case of the modified grubbs catalyst ( 174 atoms ; reaction 4 ) , the three - body term amounts to a contribution of + 14.0kjmol@xmath0 , while it is + 8.9kjmol@xmath0 for the azabox copper(i ) complex of reaction 3 ( 90 atoms , cf . ,",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] ) , and only + 1.6kjmol@xmath0 for the aquo platinum(ii ) complex of reaction 1 ( 42 atoms ) . including the three - body correction thus leads to slightly smaller ligand dissociation energies . in the case of reaction 3 , the ligand dissociation energy is 7.5kjmol@xmath0 smaller , while the ligand dissociation energy of reaction 4 is lowered by 5.3kjmol@xmath0 . clearly , these corrections do not significantly improve the agreement with the experimental values and can therefore not explain the discrepancies .    however , ligand dissociation energies could be sensitive to the spatial cut - off function , since the reactions studied involve the formation of a _ short _ metal  ligand bond ( dispersion is difficult to model at short distances@xcite ) . in order to investigate this issue , we calculated the ligand dissociation energy of reaction 3 with bp86-d3 in combination with the becke ",
    "johnson ( bj ) damping function ( the standard damping function of the d3 correction is often called zero - damping , as the dispersion interaction between two atoms approaches zero if the internuclear distance approaches zero ) . with bp86-d3-bj",
    "the reaction energy is calculated to be 298kjmol@xmath0 , while it is found to be 297kjmol@xmath0 with bp86-d3 .",
    "therefore , the damping function has only a minor effect on the overall ligand dissociation energy of reaction 3 .",
    "it is thus not likely that it can account for the discrepancies observed in this work .",
    "this result is in line with the work by grimme and coworkers who found that the damping function in general has a negligible effect on the results ( such as ligand dissociation energies)@xcite .    in order to better understand the role of dispersion interactions on the molecular structures and ligand dissociation energies , we calculated the reaction energy of reaction 8 also with bp86-d3 and b3lyp - d3 single - point calculations employing the bp86 and b3lyp structures , respectively . with bp86 ,",
    "the reaction energy is found to be 194kjmol@xmath0 .",
    "when calculating this energy with bp86-d3 at the bp86 molecular structures , a value of 208kjmol@xmath0 is found , i.e. , the ligand dissociation is more endothermic by 14kjmol@xmath0 .",
    "when carrying out also the structure optimizations with bp86-d3 , the ligand dissociation energy is even more endothermic , namely 213kjmol@xmath0 .",
    "we conclude from this that the structural changes due to dispersion interactions amount to a net effect of 5kjmol@xmath0 on the reaction energy . regarding b3lyp and b3lyp - d3 ,",
    "a similar picture emerges .",
    "b3lyp yields a reaction energy of 178kjmol@xmath0 for reaction 8 .",
    "it is changed to 184kjmol@xmath0 when dispersion interactions are considered by means of single - point calculations on the b3lyp structures .",
    "if these interactions are also taken into account during the structure optimizations , the reaction energy is 192kjmol@xmath0 .",
    "we also analyzed the explicit values for the c@xmath11 and c@xmath14 dispersion coefficients for selected reactions .",
    "for reactions 2 , 3 , and 4 , in which the dispersion corrections lead to particularly large discrepancies , data is available only for bp86-d3 and b97-d - d2 .",
    "the dispersion coefficients of the d2 and d3 methods are rather different from each other , which is due to the fact that the d2 correction includes only the ( scaled ) c@xmath11 terms , whereas the d3 method includes ( unscaled ) c@xmath11 and c@xmath14 terms .",
    "by contrast , considering the dispersion coefficients invoked for the calculation of the reactant complex of reaction 8 very similar values are applied in the bp86-d3 and b3lyp - d3 calculations .",
    "still , the many small deviations between the dispersion coefficients for bp86-d3 and b3lyp - d3 add up to a difference of 35kjmol@xmath0 in the dispersion energies for this compound ( the total dispersion energy being @xmath15215kjmol@xmath0 in the case of bp86-d3 and @xmath15180kjmol@xmath0 for b3lyp - d3 ) .",
    "the reaction energies of reaction 8 ( 213kjmol@xmath0 for bp86-d3 and 192kjmol@xmath0 for b3lyp - d3 ) agree well with the experimental reference of 194kjmol@xmath0in fact , with b3lyp - d3 the reference value is almost perfectly reproduced .",
    "however , it is very intriguing that the structures deviate more from each other ( the bp86-d3 and b3lyp - d3 structures have a rmsd of 50pm ) , than those of the corresponding parent functionals bp86 and b3lyp ( the rmsd in this case being 17pm ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results presented above with the findings obtained in previous studies . from the plethora of benchmark studies published so far we select here a few which are comparable to our work in the sense that they also focus on transition metal compounds .",
    "the data obtained in these studies is included in table [ tab : errors ] . in the first study ( which we dub `` study 1 '' here ) , zhao and truhlar@xcite studied a model system for the grubbs ii catalyst .",
    "they compared the energies of important stationary points in the catalytic cycle of the metathesis reaction obtained with different density functionals to accurate reference energies obtained with a ccsd(t)-based composite approach .",
    "as the system studied in this work is very similar to reaction 4 of our work , one would expect a similar performance for the different density functionals .",
    "in fact , we observe from the data in table [ tab : errors ] the same qualitative ordering , namely , pbe0 performs best , while pbe , tpss , and tpssh are only slightly worse .",
    "b3lyp , however , is significantly worse compared to the other functionals .",
    "nevertheless , we also observe some interesting differences compared to our study .",
    "b3lyp performs 10kjmol@xmath0 worse in the work of zhao and truhlar , while the mads of other functionals are approximately 10kjmol@xmath0 better than in our benchmark .",
    "this is in agreement with our study as we find a deviation between the experimental ligand dissociation energy of reaction 4 and the one calculated with b3lyp of 48.7kjmol@xmath0 , while pbe0 reproduces this energy rather accurately , having an error of only 4.5kjmol@xmath0 ( i.e. , this error is even smaller than the one found in study 1 ) .",
    "however , the functionals tpss and pbe have an absolute error of roughly 30kjmol@xmath0 for reaction 4 , and are thus found to be significantly worse in our study than in study 1 .    in a second , very recent",
    "study ( hereafter called `` study 2 '' ) , zhang _ el al .",
    "_  investigated 70 small 3d transition metal compounds and compared dft results to accurate experimental data@xcite .",
    "these compounds are different compared to those in our wccr10 set .",
    "nevertheless , the results of this study are in rather good agreement with our results , which might be an indication of a certain transferability of both results . the overall errors of pbe0 and pbe are approximately 7kjmol@xmath0 lower compared to our findings , and tpssh performs even roughly 14kjmol@xmath0 better in study 2 . however , it might come as a surprise that b3lyp has a mad of only 21kjmol@xmath0 in study 2 , which is in sharp contrast to our findings .",
    "finally , furche and perdew@xcite also assessed the performance of different density functionals on a data set of small 3d transition metal compounds . here , we focus on their results from the analysis of 18 different reaction energies ( such as the dissociation of v@xmath8 , coh , and crf ) , for which experimental data are also available .",
    "we denote this third study as `` study 3 '' in table [ tab : errors ] .",
    "overall , furche and perdew found larger errors for the individual functionals than in our study , which might be due to the unsaturated valencies in the small molecules leading to peculiar electron - correlation effects .",
    "the qualitative ordering is , however , roughly comparable to that found in our study .    in summary",
    ", we have seen that the actual numerical values for the absolute error of a given density functional can vary significantly , depending on the data set employed for the tests .",
    "the qualitative ordering of different density functionals appears to be more robust in this respect , although also here , different test sets can lead to different conclusions .",
    "therefore , when considering the performance of a given density functional one has to pay special attention to how this performance was assessed . while very large , diverse databases might give a good indication of the average performance of a density functional , they might under- or overestimate the errors of that density functional in a specific application .",
    "likewise , a very specialized database covering only a certain class of compounds can hardly be considered representative for a broad area of chemistry .",
    "we have presented the database wccr10 , a set of ten selected ligand dissociation energies for large transition metal complexes for which accurate , consistently measured experimental gas - phase data are available in the literature .",
    "we then investigated the performance of nine different density functionals in a mutual comparison and with respect to the experimental ligand dissociation energies .",
    "the density functionals selected encompass a broad range of different functional classes , namely gga , meta - gga , and hybrid functionals ; in addition , for some functionals also grimme s third generation dispersion correction was employed .",
    "the calculations were set up such that any result observed has to be attributed to the density functional and not to other factors such as an incomplete basis set or numerical artifacts due to loose thresholds .    in our benchmark study , we found for some reactions that grimme s dispersion correction yields reaction energies which overshoot those from experiment and from results obtained without dispersion corrections .",
    "furthermore , we have identified cases in which different dispersion - corrected functionals can lead to significantly different structures , whereas the structures resulting from the uncorrected parent functionals were in much better mutual agreement .",
    "this may not be taken as an argument against such dispersion corrections as the parent functional apparently plays a crucial role .",
    "unfortunately , a definitive assessment of the quality of the structures is not possible since there are no reliable reference data to compare with , but our study indicates that care should be taken when applying dispersion corrections in structure optimizations .    among all functionals",
    "not corrected for dispersion , b3lyp performs worst with a mean absolute deviation of about 39kjmol@xmath0 , while bp86 is a little bit better , at least in terms of the largest absolute deviation .",
    "the non - empirical density functionals pbe and tpss have a clearly smaller error both in terms of mean absolute deviation and largest absolute deviation .",
    "this result is particularly appealing from a theoretical point of view , since these density functionals are constructed by choosing a mathematical expression that satisfies constraints which would also be fulfilled by the true exchange  correlation functional , instead of by simply fitting it to a reference set of chemical data . adding a portion of hartree ",
    "fock exchange to these functionals improves their performance further .",
    "we have compared our findings to selected benchmark studies from the literature and found that the actual numerical values for the errors of the individual density functionals depend heavily on the test set chosen .",
    "the relative performance of different density functionals is  at least from a qualitative point of view  somewhat more robust with respect to the choice of the test set , but also here one finds astonishing differences .",
    "therefore , care must be taken when utilizing such benchmark results to assess the performance of density functionals .",
    "even the best functional identified for the wccr10 set , pbe0 , has a rather large mean absolute deviation . on average ,",
    "the ligand dissociation energies deviate by more than 20kjmol@xmath0 , while the maximum deviation is even as large as 55kjmol@xmath0 .",
    "as these values lie well within the range of chemically relevant energies ( which are on the order of a few kjmol@xmath0 to a few hundred kjmol@xmath0 ) , the accuracy of contemporary density functionals often can not be expected to be sufficient for a given application .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to further analyze the density functionals available today in order to find possible cures to their weaknesses .",
    "relevant for the development and benchmarking of new or improved functionals is the study of composite approaches@xcite  as exemplified by the so - called correlation - consistent composite approach ( ccca method ) of wilson and coworkers@xcite , the gaussian4 method of curtiss and coworkers@xcite , the method of peterson and coworkers@xcite , the benchmarking efforts by martin and co - workers @xcite , and a very recent approach developed by bross _",
