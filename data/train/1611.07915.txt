    "the cosmological principle is one of the most fundamental assumption in modern cosmology which states that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales .",
    "homogeneity implies translational invariance i.e. the universe looks same to all observers at different locations .",

    "these two assumptions play an important role in the analysis and interpretation of various cosmological observations .",
    "one can not prove these assumptions in a rigorously mathematical sense but it is possible to verify them using various observations .",
    "the near uniform temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is considered to be one of the best possible evidence in favour of isotropy @xcite .",
    "there are many other observations in favour of isotropy such as the angular distributions of radio sources @xcite , the x - ray background @xcite , the gamma - ray bursts @xcite , the distribution of galaxies @xcite , the distribution of supernovae @xcite and the distribution of neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "but isotropy around us alone does not guarantee homogeneity of the universe because homogeneity and isotropy may or may not coexist .",
    "the universe can be isotropic around a point without being homogeneous .",
    "the homogeneity can be inferred from isotropy only when there is isotropy around each and every point in the universe .",
    "so it is not quite straightforward to infer homogeneity of the universe from isotropy around us alone .",
    "the statistical properties of galaxy distributions can be characterized by the correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the two point correlation function quantifies the clustering strength which is well described by a power law on small scales and vanishes on large scales conforming to large scale homogeneity .",
    "however a major drawback of the correlation function for the analysis of homogeneity arise from the fact that it assumes a mean density on the scale of the survey which is not a defined quantity below the scale of homogeneity .",
    "it is well known that the galaxy distribution behave like a fractal on small scales . but @xcite analyzed the cfa1 survey and suggested that the distribution of galaxies is fractal to arbitrary large - scales .",
    "further , @xcite supported the argument of fractal universe by analyzing different samples .",

    "it is thus important to note that the transition scale to homogeneity is also sensitive to the statistical measures employed .",
    "the present analysis indicates that there exist a transition scale to homogeneity for all the tracers of the mass distribution used in this analysis .",
    "we find the transition scale to homogeneity to be quite different for the normal galaxies , lrgs and quasars .",
    "this may originate from the fact that these distributions are biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution and the large scale linear bias for these samples are expected to be quite different from each other .",
    "the quasars are found to inhabit dark matter halos of constant mass @xmath146 from the time of peak quasar activity ( @xmath147 ) and their large scale linear bias evolves from @xmath148 at @xmath149 to @xmath150 at @xmath151 @xcite .",

    "so one would expect the quasar sample to be homogeneous on larger scales than the lrg sample .",
    "@xcite applied an information theory based method @xcite to analyze the sdss dr12 quasar sample and find that the quasar distribution is homogeneous beyond a length scale of @xmath156 .",
    "information entropy is related to the higher order moments of a distribution and may be more sensitive to the homogeneities present in a distribution .",
    "but the present analysis shows that the sdss quasar sample is homogeneous on a length scale which is smaller than this and also smaller than the transition scale to homogeneity for the lrgs .",
    "this indicates that the clustering strength as indicated by their bias values may not be the only parameter deciding the transition scale to homogeneity .",
    "it should be also noted here that the quasar sample is very sparse .",
    "the poor number density of the quasar sample together with its somewhat incomplete nature may also yield such differences in our results . however despite these differences all the galaxy samples from the sdss including the main sample , the lrg sample and the quasar sample exhibit a transition to homogeneity on large scales .",
    "the present analysis thus validates the fundamental assumption of cosmic homogeneity and reaffirms that the universe is indeed statistically homogeneous on sufficiently large scales irrespective of the tracers .",
    "b.p . would like to acknowledge financial support from the serb , dst , government of india through the project emr/2015/001037 .",
    "bp would also like to acknowledge cts , iit kharagpur , iucaa , pune and tifr , mumbai for providing support for visit and use of its facilities for the present work .",
    "bp thanks somnath bharadwaj for useful comments and discussions ."
