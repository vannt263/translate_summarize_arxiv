    "it is a classical result of palais that a proper smooth action of a non - compact finite - dimensional lie group @xmath0 on a smooth manifold @xmath1 behaves in many respects like the action of a compact lie group . in particular , all orbits are closed submanifolds and the action of @xmath0 on a suitable neighborhood of an orbit can be described nicely in terms of the action of the compact stabilizer group on a slice ( @xcite ) . since properness of a group action is a purely topological concept , it also applies to smooth actions of banach  lie groups on banach manifolds .",
    "however , one can not expect results as strong as palais in this context .",
    "one reason is that a closed subspace of a banach space need not have a closed complement , @xmath5 being a simple example .",
    "since the translation action of the closed subspace @xmath6 on @xmath7 is proper , properness does not imply anything on the existence of closed complements .",
    "in particular , slices need not exist for proper smooth actions .    since the stabilizer subgroups @xmath8 are compact for a proper action , they are in particular finite - dimensional lie subgroups , so that the quotient @xmath9 carries a natural manifold structure and the smooth injection @xmath10 is a topological embedding . in this sense",
    "all orbits of a proper action carry a natural manifold structure .",
    "the main concern of this note is to show that this manifold structure is , at least in a very weak sense , compatible with that of the surrounding manifold @xmath1 , namely the tangent space of @xmath11 , i.e. , the image of the tangent map @xmath12 of the orbit map , is a closed subspace of @xmath13 . as a consequence ,",
    "palais theory carries immediately over to proper actions on hilbert manifolds . in the general case",
    "our result eliminates at least one of the assumptions , usually stated in addition to properness , for a slice theorem or a quotient theorem to hold ( cf .",

    "let @xmath0 be a banach  lie group with lie algebra @xmath14 and neutral element  @xmath15 . in the following @xmath1 will be a smooth banach manifold with a smooth action @xmath16 of @xmath0 .",
    "the diffeomorphism of @xmath1 defined by @xmath17 will be denoted @xmath18 and @xmath19 will simply be written @xmath20 or @xmath21 . for each @xmath22",
    "we denote the _ orbit map _ by @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the action is said to be _ proper _ if the smooth map @xmath29 , @xmath30 , is proper , i.e. , a closed map with compact fibers @xmath31 if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are finite - dimensional , i.e. , locally compact , properness of the action is equivalent to inverse images of compact subsets @xmath32 under @xmath33 being compact .        for the proof we need the following three lemmas . with the first lemma we are able to describe the kernel of the map @xmath35 as the lie algebra of the isotropy group of @xmath36 , for an arbitrary @xmath22 .      the isotropy subgroup @xmath37 is a compact lie subgroup of @xmath0 . in particular , its lie algebra @xmath38 is finite - dimensional , hence complemented .",
    "the quotient space @xmath9 carries a natural manifold structure such that for each closed complement @xmath39 of @xmath40 in @xmath41 the map @xmath42 is a local diffeomorphism in @xmath43 .",
    "\\(a ) it follows from the properness of the action that the set @xmath46 is compact .",

    "let @xmath63 , @xmath64 , be two differentiable function which are approximate solutions of @xmath65 in the sense that @xmath66 for all @xmath61 and @xmath64 .",
    "then we have for @xmath61 with @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70    let @xmath71 be a closed complement of @xmath40 ( see lemma  [ lem:1](a ) ) .",

    "since the orbit map @xmath77 defines an embedding of @xmath9 into @xmath1 , for each sequence @xmath78 in @xmath79 with @xmath80 for all @xmath81 , the sequence @xmath82 can not converge to @xmath22 because @xmath83 does not converge to @xmath8 in @xmath9 ( lemma  [ lem:1](b ) ) .    for any @xmath22 ,",
    "the image of @xmath84 is @xmath85 since @xmath86 is its kernel ( lemma  [ lem:1](a ) ) .",
    "since @xmath79 is a closed subspace of @xmath87 , it is a banach space and we consider the injective map @xmath88 if @xmath89 is not closed in @xmath90 , then with the aid of lemma [ lem:2 ] we find for each @xmath91 an element @xmath92 such that @xmath93 , and hence @xmath94 thus , setting @xmath95 we get a sequence @xmath96 in @xmath87 such that @xmath97 for all @xmath98 and @xmath99    let @xmath100 be a local chart for @xmath1 centered on the point @xmath36 ( that is , @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 denote the corresponding smooth vector field on the open subset @xmath56 of @xmath57 . for two banach spaces @xmath48 and @xmath49 we write @xmath103 for the space of continuous linear operators @xmath104 .",
    "then we obtain a smooth map @xmath105 ( that can be understood as the smooth map @xmath106 , where @xmath107 ) . since @xmath108 is smooth , it is in particular continuous in @xmath43 , so that we find for each @xmath109 a @xmath110 with @xmath111 . replacing @xmath56 by @xmath112 ,",

    "we have seen above that this is a contradiction to the properness of the action .",
    "if @xmath1 is a hilbert manifold and @xmath149 a smooth action of a banach  lie group which is free and proper , then the set @xmath4 of @xmath0-orbits in @xmath1 carries a unique hilbert manifold structure for which the quotient map @xmath150 is a submersion .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that for any smooth action @xmath151 of a banach  lie group and @xmath3 , the stabilizer subgroup @xmath8 is a ( not necessarily split ) lie subgroup of @xmath0 if the map @xmath152 has closed range .",
    "this result demonstrates the interesting interplay between properties of smooth actions and closedness conditions for the maps @xmath84 . for proper actions , stabilizers are compact , hence even split lie subgroups ( lemma  [ lem:1 ] ) .",
    "it is an open problem whether stabilizer subgroups @xmath8 of smooth actions are always lie subgroups .",
    "that they need not be split is an immediate consequence of the fact that for each non - split closed subspace @xmath153 of a banach space @xmath154 , the subspace @xmath153 is the stabilizer group @xmath8 of any point @xmath36 in the quotient space @xmath155 with respect to the induced action .",
