    "this means that the morphism of operads @xmath78 is connected by a zig - zag of quasi - isomorphisms to the morphism @xmath79 . using this result",
    "one can show that the functor @xmath80 is formal , i.e. quasi - isomorphic to the functor @xmath81 .",
    "one gets @xmath82 over a field any complex is quasi - isomorphic to its homology ( viewed as a complex with zero differential ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a tensor product of a @xmath21-complex with @xmath83 preserves the dimensions of the homology groups , thus the above quasi - isomorphism also ( non - naturally ) holds over @xmath21 : @xmath84 we prefer to use the singular chains rather than homology for the left - hand side to stress the fact that the right - hand side in the above quasi - isomorphism is viewed as a complex .",
    "it is easy to see that the functor @xmath85 can be factored through the category @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , the above functor is the composition of the functor @xmath53 considered in subsection  [ ss : hom_as_omega_maps ] and the functor @xmath86 that assigns the set of connected components based in the anti - disc . in case @xmath4 the anti - disc has two connected components , thus we modify a little bit @xmath87 so that it assigns only one point to an anti - disc .    intuitively the goodwillie - weiss manifold calculus is a machinery that scans a manifold ( in our case @xmath3 or rather its one - point compactification @xmath88 ) with finitely many discs , evaluate the functor on these collections of discs , and then extrapolate the functor from these data on the entire manifold .",
    "the fact that the functor @xmath89 factors through @xmath19 means that instead of scanning our manifold @xmath88 with finitely many discs we can scan it with finitely many points and extrapolate from there .",

    "this splitting ( by hodge degree @xmath92 ) is discussed in the next subsection . ] applying pirashvili s cross - effect functor   we obtain exactly the statement of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  0.2 ) .",
    "the reason we use @xmath15-modules instead of @xmath19-modules is that working with @xmath15-modules considerably reduces computations .",
    "it turns out that in the rational homology and homotopy of @xmath9 one can introduce two additional gradings that we consider below .",
    "one obviously has @xmath93",
    "@xmath94 @xmath95 in the above each summand / factor is viewed as a chain complex concentrated in a single homological degree .",
    "obviously in the above the infinite direct sum can be replaced by a direct product and vice versa .",
    "we need the sum for the first decomposition and the product for the second and third ones to obtain the following factorizations : @xmath96 @xmath97 it is not hard to show that when the dimensions are in the stable range , that is when @xmath98 , the product in   can be replaced by a direct sum , see  @xcite .",
    "again this is equivalent to saying that only finitely many factors are non - trivial in any given homological degree .",
    "we show in section  [ s : koszul ] that the same is true for the second equation  .",
    "thus theorem  [ t : hom_as_rmod ] naturally defines a double splitting in the rational homology and homotopy of @xmath9 : @xmath99 @xmath100 the additional grading @xmath101 will be called _",
    "complexity_. it is related with the vassiliev filtration in the homology by complexity of strata in the discriminant  @xcite .",
    "the grading @xmath92 will be called _",
    "hodge degree_. it comes from the hodge type decomposition in the hochschild cohomology of a commutative algebra and more generally in the ( higher order ) homology of @xmath19-modules  @xcite .",
    "we expect that the bialgebra structure of @xmath14 does not respect this splitting as a bigrading ( we know this is false for @xmath4 ) , but it must respect the splitting as a bifiltration . and the ranks of the terms of the splitting still behave in a way as if the splitting was respected as a bigrading .",
    "this follows from the fact that the graph - complex @xmath102 computing @xmath14 is naturally a polynomial bialgebra generated by the graph - complex @xmath103 computing @xmath16 , see section  [ s : graphs ] .",
    "this fact is used in lemma  [ l : euler_homot ] .      in recent years",
