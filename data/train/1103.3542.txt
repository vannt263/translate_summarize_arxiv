    "studies of central gas and stellar kinematics of nearby galaxies have revealed the presence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in almost all massive galaxies . according to the most accepted paradigm ( rees 1984 ) , galactic nuclear activity",
    "is directly related with the fueling process of these smbhs , which strongly correlates to the overall structure and evolution of the galaxies .",
    "for instance , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity seems to be triggered only in galaxies with massive bulges and intermediate colors , as pointed out by choi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , henceforth cwp09 .",
    "these authors show how the necessary conditions for agn activity depend on galaxy morphology ; for early - type galaxies low velocity dispersion and blue colors are preferred , and indicative of available gas supply for the central black hole , while intermediate velocity dispersion , intermediate - color , and more concentrated late - type galaxies are more likely to host agns , reinforcing the idea that agn host galaxies are intermediate objects between the red sequence and the blue cloud ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "if most galaxies present smbhs in their centers , a fundamental question is why not all of them host agns when gas supply is available .",
    "this is a question with no simple answer given the complexity of the processes involved in the formation and evolution of galaxies , but important clues have been proposed to elucidate the mechanisms that trigger agn activity ( martini 2004 ) .",
    "major mergers of gas - rich progenitors and galaxy interactions are two commonly invoked mechanisms that can provide gas to the center of the galaxies and fuel dormant smbhs ( hopkins et al . 2006 ; ellison et al .",
    "tidal torques exerted by non - axisymmetric features such as large - scale and nuclear bars ( jogee 2006 ) , recycled gas from dying stars in the inner kiloparsecs of the galaxy ( ciotti & ostriker 2007 ) , and enhanced viscosity of the turbulence associated with supernova explosions ( chen et al .",
    "2009 ) are just some other mechanisms that can effectively trigger nuclear activity .",
    "a common requirement for any of the mentioned mechanisms is the removal of specific angular momentum in order for the material to collapse to the center , and operate as fuel .",
    "therefore , a relation between the overall galactic @xmath0 spin parameter and the onset of agn activity is expected , with a higher frequency of agns in low spinning galaxies . statistically ,",
    "agn hosting galaxies should form a low @xmath0 population , in comparison to normal galaxies .",
    "low angular momentum is expected not only in the growing phase of smbhs , but has also been invoked to explain the formation of massive black hole seeds themselves . in this scenario ( eisenstein & loeb 1995 ; koushiappas et al .",
    "2004 ) , the direct collapse of low angular momentum material results in a typical inverse proportionality between the smbh mass and the total angular momentum ( haehnelt et al . 1998 ; colgate et al . 2003 ) .    in this work",
    ", we study the spin distribution of agn host galaxies in contrast with non - agns , parameterizing the angular momentum through the dimensionless spin parameter    @xmath2    where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the total energy , mass and angular momentum of the configuration , respectively ( peebles 1969 ) .",
    "our aim is to determine empirically if the agn population effectively presents a low spin distribution when compared with non - agns and corroborate the results arising from theoretical studies concerning the relation between @xmath0 and the smbh mass . to this end , we use a sample of galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and apply a simple model to obtain an empirical estimation of @xmath0 . the large volume limited sample allows a thorough coverage of parameter space , which permits an empirical determination of the leading galactic physical parameters driving the agn phenomena and the observed scalings with smbh mass",
    ". the physical model is presented in   2 , and the sample selection criteria in   3 . in   4",
    "we present our general results and the final conclusions are summarized in",
    "in hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) , we derived a simple estimate of @xmath0 for disk galaxies in terms of observational parameters and showed some clear correlations between this parameter and type defining structural parameters .",
    "here we briefly recall the main ingredients of the simple model .",
    "the model considers only two components , a disk for the baryonic component with an exponential surface mass density @xmath6 ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a radial coordinate , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two constants which are allowed to vary from galaxy to galaxy , and a dark matter halo having a singular isothermal density profile @xmath11 , responsible for establishing a rigorously flat rotation curve @xmath12 throughout the entire galaxy :    @xmath13    in this model we are further assuming that ( 1 ) the specific angular momentum of the disk and halo are equal ( e.g. mo et al .",
    "1998 ; zavala et al .",
    "2008 ) ; ( 2 ) the total energy is dominated by that of the halo which is a virialized gravitational structure ; and ( 3 ) the disk mass is a constant fraction of the halo mass , @xmath14 .",
    "these assumptions allow us to express @xmath0 as    @xmath15    finally , we introduce a baryonic tully  fisher ( tf ) relation : @xmath16 ( e.g. , gurovich et al .",
    "2004 ) . taking the milky way as a representative example , we evaluate @xmath17 and @xmath18 to obtain    @xmath19    we proved the accuracy in our estimation of @xmath0 in cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , comparing the estimation using equation ( [ lamobs ] ) to values arising from numerical simulations of six distinct groups , where the actual value of @xmath0 is known , as it is one of the parameters of the simulated galaxies , and where this can also be estimated through equation ( [ lamobs ] ) , as baryonic disk scale lengths and disk rotation velocities are part of the output .",
    "the result was a one - to - one correlation , with very small dispersion and no bias , leading to typical errors @xmath20 30% , which we include throughout .",
    "the use of this estimate for large sdss samples led us in hernandez et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to a first empirical derivation of the distribution of @xmath0 parameters in the local universe and a measure of the scalings of this parameter with local environment and halo mass .",
    "these results were latter confirmed by berta et al .",
    "( 2008 ) using an estimate of @xmath0 through equation ( [ lamobs ] ) , also used by gogarten et al .",
    "( 2010 ) as an unbiased first - order @xmath0 measurement .",
    "the sample of galaxies used in this work is an enhanced version of the study by cwp09 .",
    "the galaxies come from the large - scale structure sample , dr4plus , using the new york university value - added galaxy catalogue ( vagc ; blanton et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is a galaxy subset of the sdss data release 5 ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the korea institute for advanced study - vagc ( choi et al . 2010 ) . a detailed description of the sample can be found in choi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and cwp09 .",
    "the rest - frame absolute magnitudes of individual galaxies were computed in the @xmath8 band , using galaxy reddening correction ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) and @xmath21-corrections as described by blanton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , with a mean evolution correction given by tegmark et al .",
    "we define a volume - limited sample with a lower magnitude cut - off @xmath22 , with redshifts @xmath23 , and a total number of 87,590 galaxies .",
    "disk scale lengths are estimated from one - component light fits , which implicitly account for the presence of low angular momentum material in bulges .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "using an extensive sample of galaxies extracted from the sdss dr5 , we show that the empirical distributions of the @xmath0 spin parameter of agns and non - agn host galaxies are qualitatively and quantitatively different , the first distribution having lower @xmath0 values and smaller dispersion around the median when compared with the latter .",
    "another striking difference between the two populations is that while the spin of normal galaxies presents a dependence on absolute magnitude , with a systematic decrease of @xmath0 with increasing luminosity , agn host galaxies present at all @xmath24 low @xmath0 values .",
    "this result , in addition to the increase of the agn fraction for decreasing @xmath0 , highlights the requirement for galaxies to have low spin in order to host agns and should be taken into account in semi - analytic models that exclusively use the halo or stellar mass to reproduce the fraction of galaxies belonging to different activity classes ( e.g. , wang & kauffmann 2008 ; fontanot et al .",
    "seeding agns into modeled dark matter halos should primarily consider @xmath0 , in order to better model the observed universe .    for the agn sample we found that the inferred mass of the smbhs shows a weak dependence on the spin of the hosting galaxies , with increasing mass for decreasing spin , a logical result if we need the gas to be accreted onto the central massive object , a process that can be more effectively accomplished if the raw material originally has low angular momentum .",
    "we recovered the leading @xmath25-@xmath0 relation at fixed absolute magnitude , with typically higher smbh mass for brighter galaxies at fixed @xmath0 , showing a double dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath24 and @xmath0 .",
    "given that the trend with the spin is present at all @xmath24 bins , this could account , to a certain degree , for the dispersion in the well established @xmath25luminosity relation .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a thorough reading and constructive comments that helped to enrich our study .",
