    "after the breakthrough in the preparation and detection of bose  einstein condensates of rubidium  @xcite , sodium  @xcite , and lithium  @xcite , the second generation of experiments on ultracold , magnetically trapped bose gases now starts to probe condensate properties such as the temperature dependence of the condensate fraction  @xcite or collective excitations of the condensate  @xcite .",
    "a matter - of - principle experiment has shown the feasibility of an output coupler for condensed trapped atoms  @xcite , two different , overlapping condensates have been produced in a single trap  @xcite , and interference fringes between two freely expanding condensates have been demonstrated  @xcite , thus proving first - order coherence of `` mesoscopic '' matter waves .",
    "higher - order coherence has been inferred from three - body recombination rates of condensed atoms  @xcite , and even the propagation of sound in a bose condensate could be directly observed  @xcite .",
    "these developments naturally force the theorist to investigate a conceptually important question : when dealing with bose  einstein condensates consisting of about @xmath0 to @xmath1 particles in a magnetic trap , to which extent can the different thermodynamical ensembles be considered as equivalent ?",
    "a bose gas cooled below the condensation point and kept in a trap is neither in thermal contact with a heat bath , nor exchanging particles with some particle reservoir .",
    "hence , the only ensemble that is appropriate for describing this situation is the microcanonical one . and",
    "yet , the theoretical discussion of trapped condensates so far mainly relies on the grand canonical ensemble .    within the grand canonical ensemble ,",
    "the description of a trapped , ideal bose gas consisting of @xmath2 particles is comparatively simple .",
    "we consider an isotropic harmonic trap with oscillator frequency @xmath3 , so that the degree of degeneracy of the @xmath4-th single - particle state is @xmath5 hence , the difference @xmath6 of the chemical potential and the single - particle ground state energy is determined by the equation @xmath7 - 1 }    \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the boltzmann constant , and @xmath9 is the temperature .",
    "this sum can be evaluated approximately by introducing the density of states @xmath10 with @xmath11 , which follows immediately from eq .",
    "( [ deg ] ) . converting the sum into an integral and applying standard arguments",
    ", one then finds the condensation temperature  @xcite @xmath12 \\ ; , \\label{tco}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the condensation temperature pertaining to the large-@xmath2-limit  @xcite ; @xmath14 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the lowering of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath16 is of order @xmath17 and results from the enhancement of the density of states  ( [ rho ] ) above the leading `` volume''-term : since there are more states available , the need to condense arises only at lower temperatures .",
    "it should be noted that , strictly speaking , there is no well - defined condensation temperature for a gas consisting of a finite number of particles .",
    "however , fig .",
    "1 clearly demonstrates that the onset of condensation in a three - dimensional harmonic trap becomes quite sharp already for particle numbers of the order of  @xmath18 , and eq .",
    "( [ tco ] ) describes this onset very well .",
    "in contrast to the textbook case of the free bose gas , the heat capacity of the harmonically trapped bose gas exhibits a steep drop at the condensation point . as shown in fig .  2 , this drop becomes a discontinuous jump by about @xmath19 per particle in the large-@xmath2-limit .",
    "remaining within the scope of the grand canonical ensemble , this analysis can be made formally more precise , and generalized to moderately anisotropic harmonic traps  @xcite , which changes the value of @xmath20 .",
    "but can one rely on the grand canonical ensemble ?",
    "ziff , uhlenbeck , and kac have made a case that _ the grand canonical ensemble does not represent any physical situation for the condensed ideal bose gas _ , and advocate that _",
    "its anomalous predictions should be ignored _",
    "these `` anomalous predictions '' are related to what we call the `` grand canonical fluctuation catastrophe '' : within the grand canonical ensemble , the r.m.s .- fluctuations @xmath21 of the ground state occupation number @xmath22 are given by  @xcite @xmath23 implying that @xmath21 is of the order of the total particle number @xmath2 below the condensation point .",
    "however , if we consider an isolated bose gas in a trap , all particles occupy the ground state at zero temperature , so that the true fluctuations of @xmath22 vanish .",
    "the grand canonical prediction for @xmath21 thus differs drastically from the microcanonical one .",
    "since the magnitude of the fluctuations @xmath21 is related to the coherence properties of the condensate , it is of substantial interest to compute the true , i.e. , microcanonical fluctuations for a trapped ideal bose gas .",
    "we will study an isotropic harmonic trapping potential with oscillator frequency @xmath3 in @xmath24 dimensions , and denote by @xmath25 the number of excitation quanta for some preassigned value of the excitation energy @xmath26 : @xmath27 the prime task now is to determine the number @xmath28 of microstates .",
    "since there are generally many microstates where only a part of the @xmath2 particles carries all @xmath25 excitation quanta , leaving the other particles in the ground state , @xmath28 equals the number of possibilities for distributing the @xmath25 quanta over _ at most _",
    "@xmath2 bose particles .",
    "then the difference @xmath29 is the number of possibilities for distributing @xmath25 quanta over _ exactly _ @xmath30 particles , with @xmath30 ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath2 , so that @xmath32 is the probability for finding @xmath30 out of @xmath2 particles excited when the total excitation energy is @xmath33 . since the remaining @xmath34 particles occupy the ground state , the first moment @xmath35 of the distribution  ( [ dis ] ) yields die microcanonical expectation value of the ground state occupation number according to @xmath36 the corresponding fluctuations follow from @xmath37",
    "the case @xmath38 had been considered already in 1949 by temperley  @xcite , and shortly thereafter by nanda  @xcite .",
    "it is of particular interest , since it can be treated in detail analytically with the tools furnished by the theory of the partion of integers : the number @xmath39 of microstates corresponds to the number of partitions of the integer @xmath25 into at most @xmath2 summands ; the commutativity of the summands reflects the indistinguishability of the bosons .",
    "we now have to distinguish two cases : if @xmath40 , then the fact that the number of particles is finite has no consequences for the enumeration of microstates , and we are dealing with _ unrestricted _ partitions of @xmath25 . if @xmath41 , the partitions of @xmath25 are _ restricted _ by the requirement that the number of summands , corresponding to the number of excited particles , does not exceed @xmath2 .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath40 .",
    "we follow the usual convention and denote the number of unrestricted partitions of @xmath25 as @xmath42 . introducing the dimensionless inverse temperature @xmath43 , it is an elementary exercise to show that @xmath44 which means that the generating function for @xmath42 corresponds , physically speaking , to the canonical partition function of a fictituous system of infinitely many distinguishable harmonic oscillators with frequencies that are integer multiples of @xmath3 . given this , it is natural to introduce the new variable @xmath45 and to extract the numbers @xmath42 by inverting eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) with the help of the saddle point approximation , after expressing @xmath46 in terms of @xmath25 .",
    "but we have to be careful : for temperatures that may physically be considered as `` low '' , but are still high compared to @xmath47 , the variable @xmath48 is close to unity , so that we need to know the behaviour of @xmath49 in the vicinity of a singularity",
    ". however , there exists the remarkable identity ( see eq .",
    "( 1.42 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath50 that links the low - temperature behaviour of our fictituous oscillator system to its high - temperature dynamics .",
    "this allows us to derive the low - temperature approximation @xmath51 which , in turn , yields the desired energy - temperature relation : @xmath52 now we can compute the canonical entropy @xmath53 and apply `` bethe s theorem ''  @xcite to get @xmath54 }      { \\left(-2\\pi\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\xi}\\right)^{1/2 } }      \\ ; = \\ ; \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{3}n}\\exp\\!\\left(\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}n}\\right ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] the right hand side is nothing but the celebrated hardy  ramanujan formula for the number of unrestricted partitions  @xcite , so we have just sketched a physicist s solution to a number - theoretical problem .",
    "there is one detail that deserves particular attention : bethe s theorem amounts to the inversion of the canonical partition sum  ( [ gen ] ) within the saddle point approximation , so that the dominant contributions to this sum are properly taken into account within the gaussian approximation . as a result , the microcanonical entropy @xmath55 differs from the canonical entropy @xmath56 by the saddle point correction @xmath57 .",
    "such differences between thermodynamical quantities pertaining to different ensembles are characteristic for small systems . expressed the other way round , the usually assumed equality of thermodynamical quantites in different ensembles holds to the extent that such saddle point corrections can be neglected .",
    "now we can turn to the case @xmath41 , where the number of quanta exceeds the number of particles , and have to determine the number @xmath58 of restricted partitions of @xmath25 . in principle , one can proceed as in the previous case , since there is the identity  @xcite @xmath59 the generating function for @xmath60 , that is , the canonical partition function for @xmath2 ideal bosons trapped by a one - dimensional harmonic potential , equals the canonical partition function of a system of @xmath2  harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath3 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding asymptotic formula for @xmath60 , which turns out to be rather intricate , has been given by auluck and kothari  @xcite .",
    "however , a beautiful theorem due to erds and lehner  @xcite helps to simplify the analysis : if , for some given @xmath25 and @xmath64 , the number @xmath2 obeys @xmath65 then @xmath66 hence , for given large values of @xmath25 and @xmath2 we _ define _ @xmath64 according to @xmath67 and obtain the approximation @xmath68 in order to check this approximation , we first determine the numbers @xmath69 by means of the saddle point inversion of eq .  ( [ res ] ) , evaluate the distributions  ( [ dis ] ) , and compute the relative fluctuations @xmath70 according to eq .",
    "( [ flu ] ) .",
    "the results for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath18 are shown as full lines in fig .",
    "3 . the corresponding data obtained with the help of the erds ",
    "lehner approximation  ( [ elf ] ) are indicated by the dashed lines . evidently , the approximation is quite good already for @xmath73 .",
    "the merit of the approximation  ( [ elf ] ) lies in the fact that it allows us to derive an analytical expression for the microcanonical low - temperature ground state fluctuations of the ideal bose gas trapped by a one - dimensional harmonic potential  @xcite : @xmath74 as already seen in fig .  3",
    ", the low - temperature fluctuations vanish linearly with temperature .",
    "most notably , they do _ not _ depend on the particle number @xmath2 .",
    "this is immediately obvious for temperatures below the `` restriction temperature '' @xmath75 that is defined by the condition @xmath76 , since below @xmath75 the number of microstates becomes independent of @xmath2 , so that `` the condensate has no chance to know how many particles it consists of '' .",
    "however , for @xmath77 this restriction temperature is merely of the order of @xmath78 , since @xmath79 , wheras the @xmath2-independence of @xmath21 actually persists almost up to @xmath80 , where the occupation of the ground state becomes significant  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath2-independence of @xmath21 appears to be characteristic for isolated condensates in general , as we shall indicate below .",
    "the analysis for the case @xmath81 proceeds in close analogy to the case @xmath77 .",
    "the restriction temperature , determined from @xmath82 , now reads @xmath83 which means that @xmath84 is about one fourth of the condensation temperature for a gas consisting of @xmath1 particles .",
    "below @xmath84 the number of microstates , and hence all thermodynamical properties of the trapped gas , are independent of the particle number @xmath2 .",
    "accordingly , we write @xmath85 for @xmath25 corresponding to temperatures  @xmath9 less than @xmath84 , so that @xmath86 denotes the three - dimensional analogue of @xmath42 .",
    "the generating function for @xmath86 again equals the canonical partition function of a system of infinitely many , distinguishable harmonic oscillators  @xcite : @xmath87^{g_j } }      \\equiv z^{(3)}_{\\infty}(\\xi ) \\ ; . \\label{osc}\\ ] ] the saddle point inversion of this generating function is straightforward , but a bit tedious .",
    "the result has been given by nanda in 1951  @xcite : @xmath88      \\widetilde{n}^{1/4 } + b \\right )     \\label{nan}\\ ] ] with @xmath89 and @xmath90 this is one of the rare examples of a truly asymptotic formula for the number of microstates of a non - trivial bose system .    for temperatures above @xmath84 the finiteness of the particle number",
    "restricts the number of microstates , and we have to compute @xmath91 .",
    "it turns out that the logarithm of @xmath86 provides a quite good approximation to @xmath92 even up to the condensation temperature  @xcite , so that the entropy of the fictituous boltzmannian oscillator system described by the partition function  ( [ osc ] ) approximates the entropy of the trapped bose gas for all temperatures below the onset of condensation .",
    "this means that the distributions @xmath93 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) must be well peaked ; those microstates where the @xmath41 quanta are actually `` spread out '' over all @xmath2 particles carry only a minor statistical weight below @xmath15 .",
    "but still , this finding is of no help for computing the fluctuations @xmath21 , since this computation requires , according to eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) , to consider auxiliary systems consisting of @xmath94 particles and to determine the numbers @xmath95 .",
    "the problem now is that an immediate analogue to the generating function  ( [ res ] ) does not exist , that is , the canonical @xmath2-particle partition function @xmath96 is not known in closed form",
    ". however , there exists the recursion formula  @xcite @xmath97 that can numerically be evaluated and inverted within the saddle point approximation , so that we can determine the distributions @xmath93 at least numerically with high precision  @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath98 are shown in fig .  4",
    ": as anticipated , the distributions are well peaked , and moreover remarkably close to gaussians .    from the expectation values of these distributions we obtain the microcanonical expectation values of the ground state occupation number , depicted as the full line in fig .",
    "the agreement with the corresponding grand canonical data ( dashed ) is stunning , but in view of the preceding fig .",
    "4 not unexpected : the predictions of the different ensembles will be the same as long as the most probable values of @xmath30 coincide with the expectation values , which is the case as long as the distributions @xmath93 stay symmetrical .",
    "this , in turn , is guaranteed as long as the support of these distributions stays away from the border @xmath99 .",
    "hence , there is a slight difference between the microcanonical and the grand canonical ground state fraction only in the immediate vicinity of the condensation point . for @xmath77",
    "this difference is much more pronounced , since @xmath100 is considerably less well peaked  @xcite than its counterpart for @xmath81 .",
    "6 shows the microcanonical fluctuations of the ground state occupation number for @xmath81 and @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "remarkably , the low - temperature fluctuations for these three systems agree perfectly . more generally ,",
    "if we compare two trapped bose gases with different @xmath2 under otherwise identical conditions , then their fluctuations @xmath21 are nearly identical for temperatures below the lower of their condensation temperatures .",
    "this finding generalizes the formula  ( [ gsf ] ) .",
    "again , the @xmath2-independence of @xmath21 is immediately obvious for temperatures lower than the restriction temperature @xmath84 , but it actually persists almost up to the condensation temperature , as a result of the well - peakedness of the distributions @xmath93 .",
    "we now come back to our initial question : can we rely on the grand canonical ensemble for bose  einstein condensation in isolated traps ? as long as we are only interested in the usual thermodynamical quantities ,",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "5 has shown that the grand canonical prediction for the ground state occupation number in a three - dimensional trap is almost indistinguishable from the microcanonical one even if the particle number @xmath2 is as low as @xmath103 .",
    "but in view of the fact that one - dimensional traps are not out of reach  @xcite , it should be kept in mind that these differences are larger for @xmath77  @xcite .    another comparison between different ensembles is presented in fig .  7 , which depicts the grand canonical ( long dashes ) , canonical ( short dashes ) , and microcanonical ( full line ) specific heat capacity for @xmath81 and @xmath98 .",
    "again , noticeable differences can be found only close to the onset of condensation .",
    "but when it comes to quantum statistical properties , the grand canonical ensemble is unsound  @xcite . adopting the microcanonical spirit and starting from the enumeration of microstates ,",
    "we have computed the microcanonical low - temperature fluctuations @xmath21 for harmonically trapped bose gases . while the case @xmath77 could be treated fully analytically , leading to eq .",
    "( [ gsf ] ) , the case @xmath81 had to rely on the numerical evaluation of the recursion relation  ( [ rec ] ) .",
    "if one could derive an analytical approximation to the numbers @xmath91 for @xmath41 , with a quality similar to that of the erds ",
    "lehner approximation  ( [ elf ] ) to @xmath58 , then the case @xmath81 could be brought into the same textbook status that the case @xmath77 already has by now .",
    "it is also worthwhile to point out that very recently navez _",
    "have proposed a new statistical ensemble , within which the ground state particles act as a reservoir , and exchange of particles with the excited - states subsystem without exchange of energy is possible  @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the fluctuations @xmath21 obtained with the help of this so - called `` maxwell s demon ensemble '' agree very favourably with our strictly microcanonical results , so that this ensemble might constitute a valuable tool for further studies .    in closing , we reiterate the most important result of the present analysis : while the grand canonical ensemble predicts , for ideal bose gases at low temperatures , ground state number fluctuations @xmath21 of the order @xmath2 , and while usual thermodynamical fluctuations scale as  @xmath104 , the low - temperature fluctuations @xmath21 for trapped , isolated ideal bose condensates are independent of the total particle number @xmath2 .",
