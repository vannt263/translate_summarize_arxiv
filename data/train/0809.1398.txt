    "networks are useful tools to characterize complex systems  @xcite .",
    "the system components are represented as nodes and their mutual interactions as edges .",
    "finding structures in such networks is therefore of great relevance for understanding the mechanisms that underlie the system evolution .",
    "this explains the increasing interest in the topic , particularly in the detection of communities   @xcite .",
    "communities are groups of nodes with a high level of group inter - connection @xcite .",
    "they can be seen as relative isolated subgraphs with few contacts with the rest of the network .",
    "communities have an obvious significance for social networks where they correspond to groups of close friends or well - established teams of collaborators @xcite .",
    "however , they are also important for characterizing other real - world networks such as those coming from biology  @xcite or from technology and transport  @xcite .",
    "communities are not the only meaningful structures in networks : in ecology , computer and social sciences structurally equivalent nodes have been also considered  @xcite . these nodes are characterized by similar connectivity patterns and are expected to play similar roles within the system .",
    "there has been a long tradition of applying bayesian and maximum likelihood methods to structure detection in networks  @xcite .",
    "these methods have the advantage that , depending on the statistical model used , they can be very general detecting both communities and structural equivalent set of nodes .",
    "the drawback , shared with many other methods , is that structure detection usually implies computational expensive exploration of the solutions maximizing the posterior probability or the likelihood .",
    "recently , a maximum likelihood method that considers node clustering as missing information and deals with it using an expectation maximization ( em ) approach has been introduced by newman and leicht  @xcite .",
    "this method is computationally less costly to implement and we will denote it by the acronym nl - em from now on . nl - em is able to identify network structure relying on three basic assumptions : ( _ i _ ) the actual connectivity of the network is related to a coherent yet _ a priori _ unknown grouping of the nodes , ( _ ii _ ) the presence or absence of a link is independent from the other links of the network and ( _ iii _ ) the groups are tell - tales of processes that gave rise to the graph .",
    "no extra information is assumed except for the network itself and the number of groups . under these assumptions ,",
    "the method infers the classification of nodes that most likely generated the graph detecting communities and also structurally equivalent sets of nodes @xcite . here",
    "we will show that due to the simple structure of the nl - em likelihood , its classifications are based on a subset of nodes which turn out to be responsible for establishing the group memberships of their neighbors .",
    "we are able to rank the nodes according to the amount of group - allocation information they transmit to their neighbors and thereby identify those that are essential for establishing each group .",
    "these nodes , which we will refer to as stabilizers , constitute the backbone of the classification : the classification would not be viable without them and conversely , stabilizers turn out to emerge as a result of their distinct connection patterns on the given graph . given the generality of the nl - em underlying assumptions and that the resulting classifications can be validated by comparison with other clustering methods , we suggest that the stabilizers have an important inherent value for understanding the processes that generated the given network .",
    "such an expectation is supported by our results on empirical graphs for which additional information regarding the nodes intrinsic properties is available .",
    "we will also briefly discuss the extension of this concept to other inference methods such as bayesian clustering techniques  @xcite .",
    "we begin with a quick summary of nl - em as applied to graphs . labeling the nodes as @xmath0 , the variables are : @xmath1 , the probability that a randomly selected node is in group @xmath2 , @xmath3 , the probability that an edge leaving group @xmath2 connects to node @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , the probability that node @xmath6 belongs to group @xmath2 .",
    "the method is a mixture model where an edge between nodes @xmath6 and @xmath4 ( expressed as @xmath7 ) given the groups of @xmath6 and @xmath4 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) is observed with probability @xmath10 the edges are considered as independent so the probability that a given grouping realizes an observed network @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 ,   \\label{eqn : proba}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the set formed by the neighbors of node @xmath6 .",
    "the group assignment captured by the terms @xmath5 is treated as missing information .",
    "the expectation step of em can thus be implemented as an average over the log - likelihood @xmath14 . \\label{loglik}\\ ] ] the maximization of @xmath15 is subject to the normalization constraints , @xmath16 and leads to @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the degree of node @xmath4 .",
    "the group assignment probabilities @xmath19 are determined _ a posteriori _ from @xmath20 as @xmath21 the maximization of @xmath22 can be carried out with different techniques . in order to account for the possible existence of a rough likelihood landscape with many local extrema , we employed an algorithm that alternates between simulated annealing and direct greedy iteration of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : em ] ) and ( [ eqn : qir ] ) .",
    "the group membership of the nodes is encoded by the probabilities @xmath19 .",
    "it is thus natural to ask for the conditions on a node @xmath6 and its neighbors to have @xmath6 crisply classified into a single group @xmath2 so that @xmath23 .",
    "the answer highlights the role of the neighbors in establishing a node s membership credentials .",
    "looking at the expression for @xmath5 , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : qir ] ) , @xmath24 where the non - zero prefactors whose sole role is to ensure proper normalization have been suppressed , one finds that for each group @xmath25 there must be at least one neighbor @xmath4 of @xmath6 whose probability @xmath26 is zero .",
    "however , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : em ] ) , whether @xmath26 is zero or not for some group @xmath27 depends in turn on the group memberships of the neighbors of @xmath4 . hence having a node crisply classified as belonging to a group sets strong constraints on its neighbors and their respective neighborhoods .",
    "these constraints propagate throughout the network during the nl - em iteration until a final configuration for @xmath28 and @xmath19 is established . in this sense",
    ", a node @xmath4 is passing information about group membership to its neighborhood through the probabilities @xmath26 .",
    "this information is negative , of the form `` you do not belong to group @xmath29 '' when @xmath30 is zero and we say that node @xmath4 stabilizes its neighbors against membership in group @xmath29 .",
    "it is worth noting the parallels of this mechanism with message passing algorithms  @xcite . in a classification into @xmath31 groups each crisply classified node @xmath6",
    "must be stabilized against @xmath32 groups .",
    "thus one can regard the number of groups a node @xmath4 stabilizes against as a measure of the amount of information @xmath33 that @xmath4 passes to its neighbors .",
    "if @xmath34 , node @xmath4 can stabilize its adjacent nodes alone providing thus complete information about their group membership .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath35 , @xmath4 provides only partial information .",
    "the crisp classification of a neighbor @xmath6 requires then the combined action of other adjacent nodes in order to attain full group membership information .",
    "we denote as _ stabilizers _ of @xmath6 the union set of neighbors that alone or in combined action pass essential information to @xmath6 establishing its membership in a single group ( a more precise definition will be given below ) .",
    "the above analysis implies that any crisply classified node must be stabilized by one or more stabilizers .",
    "therefore , if the assumptions of the statistical model are justified and the resulting node classification is meaningful , the identification of the corresponding stabilizers may offer useful additional information .    based on their classification and",
    "the information passed , four types of nodes can be distinguished : nodes can be strong or weak depending on whether they are crisply classified into a single group or not , and they can be stabilizers or not , depending on whether they pass essential information for establishing an adjacent node s group membership . if we consider a node @xmath6 and denote by @xmath36 , the set of groups that @xmath6 does not connect to , and by @xmath37 , the set of groups that @xmath6 does not belong to , the nl - em equations ( [ eqn : em ] ) and([eqn : qir ] ) relate these sets as follows : @xmath38 forming a set of consistency relations with a simple meaning : a node can not belong to a group to which its neighbors do not connect , and the common set of groups to which a node s neighbors do not belong must correspond to the groups that it does not connect to . if we require in particular that a node @xmath6 is strong , _",
    "i.e. _ it is crisply classified as belonging to a particular group @xmath39 , then @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "given the sets @xmath41 associated with the neighbors @xmath4 of a strong node @xmath6 , not all adjacent nodes need to contribute to its full stabilization .",
    "likewise , node @xmath6 can be stabilized by different combinations of its neighbors sets @xmath41 .",
    "this is best illustrated by an example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] .",
    "suppose that the groups are @xmath42 and let us assume that node @xmath6 is crisply classified as @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath6 have four neighbors with corresponding sets @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "it is clear that all four nodes together must stabilize @xmath6 , as otherwise @xmath6 would not be a strong node .",
    "however , the sets of neighbors @xmath48 or @xmath49 each suffice to stabilize node @xmath6 .",
    "the node @xmath50 is redundant , since it does not contribute a new class against which @xmath51 or @xmath52 are not already stabilizing .",
    "in other words , if the set @xmath53 is considered , node @xmath50 can be removed without altering the stabilization of @xmath6 .",
    "the same is not true for the nodes @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the notion of stabilization sets and stabilizer nodes can be defined as follows : a subset of nodes adjacent to @xmath6 is a stabilization set of @xmath6 , if the removal of any one of the nodes from the set causes @xmath6 not to be stabilized by that set anymore .",
    "a node @xmath4 is a stabilizer if it is member of at least one stabilization set .",
    "the definition of stabilizer involves thus a stabilization relation with at least one of the node neighbors . in the above example , @xmath54 and @xmath52 are the only stabilizers of @xmath6 .",
    "non - stabilizer nodes can be removed without affecting stabilization , while whenever a stabilizer is removed the number of ways in which a given node is stabilized decreases . in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] , the removal of node @xmath51 would cause complete loss of stabilization of @xmath6 , while removal of @xmath52 or @xmath55 would leave @xmath6 with only a single stabilization .",
    "it can be shown that the removal of a stabilizer will never turn a previously non - stabilizer node into a stabilizer , but it might turn some stabilizers into non - stabilizers .",
    "note that in a sense stabilizer @xmath51 is more important than @xmath55 or @xmath52 , since it is part of every stabilization of @xmath6 and its removal will thus render @xmath6 a weak node .",
    "in fact , one could attach a strength to each stabilizer by keeping track of the number of stabilizations in which it is involved , but , for sake of simplicity , we will not pursue this here .    given an nl - em classification with strong nodes , we can immediately identify the stabilizers that are responsible for the crisp classifications .",
    "details on how to implement the identification of stabilizers are provided in appendix a.2 .",
    "the relation @xmath6 stabilizes @xmath4 induces a directed subgraph on the original network and we will refer to this as the stabilizer subgraph .",
    "the relation between two stabilizer nodes is not necessarily of mutual stabilization : a necessary condition for adjacent strong nodes @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath4 to mutually stabilize each other is that both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are empty .",
    "the connections among strong stabilizers capture the relations between groups in the graph . in that sense",
    "one can regard the stabilizers as exemplary members of the groups . in the undirected graphs of figs .",
    "[ fig : random ] - [ fig : adj ] the stabilizer subgraph has been superposed .",
    "the extension of these concepts to nl - em classifications in directed graphs is similar , details are given in appendix b.    the case of nl - em classifications into two groups is particularly simple .",
    "denoting the groups as @xmath39 and @xmath58 , a crisply - classified ( strong ) node belongs to either @xmath39 or @xmath58 and a strong node of a given group has to be stabilized against the complementary group .",
    "all nodes with non - empty @xmath59 are therefore stabilizers , and if more than one is present all are equivalent , each stabilizing a given node independently from the other stabilizers . moreover , the strong stabilizers are nodes that are stabilized themselves by some of their neighbors which necessarily are also stabilizers . the conditions of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sets ] ) permit only two possible configurations of the stabilizer subgraphs . either strong stabilizers of group @xmath39",
    "connect to strong stabilizers of their own group , or stabilizers of group @xmath39 connect to those of the complementary group @xmath58 . in the former case",
    "we get a disjoint community like partition ( _ cf . _",
    "[ fig : sen ] ) of the stabilizer graph , whereas in the latter case we obtain a bipartite partition ( _ cf .",
    "[ fig : adj ] ) .    furthermore , the nl - em classification into two groups reveals a simple but meaningful hierarchical structure in the way the different type of nodes in the classification relate .",
    "strong ( non - stabilizer ) nodes are nodes for which @xmath60 , so these nodes connect to nodes of both groups ( weak or strong ) , however in order for them to be strongly classified as in one group , let us say , @xmath39 ( @xmath58 ) they can only connect to those stabilizer nodes with the compatible stabilizer classes @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) . in turn",
    ", the neighborhood of strong stabilizer nodes with @xmath63 or @xmath61 can consist only of nodes strongly classified as @xmath58 or @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the weak stabilizer nodes are by definition nodes for which @xmath64 , but for which @xmath63 or @xmath61 .",
    "thus weak stabilizer nodes can not connect to strong stabilizer nodes , but they can stabilize strong ( non - stabilizer ) nodes . finally , the weak nodes that are neither strong nor stabilizing can connect to strong non - stabilizing nodes and other weak nodes . in this way the connection rules for the strong stabilizers , weak stabilizers , strong nodes , and weak nodes set up a hierarchy of nodes at the core of which are the strong stabilizers .",
    "as we observed in the previous section , a node can be stabilized by its neighbors in multiple ways .",
    "this redundancy renders classifications robust against disorder introduced by the addition or removal of edges up to a certain point . to illustrate this we consider a benchmark with four communities  @xcite .",
    "the initial network is generated with four disjoint groups of @xmath65 nodes each , with the nodes having on average @xmath66 in - group links .",
    "these groups correspond to the four clusters of fig .",
    "[ fig : random](a)-(d ) . random links connecting different groups are added to the basic configuration and the number of stabilizers are tracked as a function of the average number of out - group links @xmath67 .",
    "[ fig : random ] shows the stabilizers obtained from an nl - em classification into @xmath68 groups at disorder level @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    when @xmath71 we find a crisp classification where all nodes are strong stabilizers , meaning that all nodes stabilize and are being stabilized .",
    "furthermore , all of them provide complete stabilization information , @xmath72 , with a single stabilizer sufficing to crisply classify a neighbor . since @xmath66 , there is on average 16-fold redundancy in the stabilization of each node .",
    "as random connections are added to the network , the four clusters become connected with each other .",
    "some of the stabilizers start to stabilize against fewer classes , giving rise to a decrease in the average @xmath73 . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : random_class ] , we have plotted how the average stabilization information decays when @xmath67 increases . in order for nodes with @xmath74 to be stabilizers they have to act in combined action with other nodes , as in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] .",
    "thus an increase of the level of disorder @xmath67 causes both a reduction in the redundancy of stabilizations of strong nodes and a shift towards stabilizations by combined action of more than one stabilizer .",
    "the increase in disorder eventually leads to a loss of strong nodes , implying that the classification deteriorates . in order to assess the quality of classifications",
    ", we use the entropy @xmath75 , as defined in @xcite @xmath76 the entropy @xmath75 measures the crispness of a classification .",
    "when @xmath77 , all the nodes are strong , while @xmath78 corresponds to case where the classification of the nodes is maximally uncertain .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : random_class ] displays @xmath75 as a function of @xmath67 , showing that the crispness of the classification is lost for large @xmath67 .",
    "the increase in entropy is closely related to what happens to the different nodes in the classification as edges are added , particularly to the stabilizers .",
    "the variation of the number of the different type of nodes with @xmath67 is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : random_class ] .",
    "as the addition of new edges progresses , some nodes cease to be strong stabilizers .",
    "when a node is not a strong stabilizer anymore , it can still remain strong as long as there are other nodes stabilizing it in its neighborhood . as can be seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : random_class ] , this is what is happening up to @xmath79 : the number of strong stabilizers decreases while the number of strong nodes rises accordingly .",
    "therefore , initially the effect of adding edges is to convert strong stabilizers into strong nodes .",
    "most of the nodes remain strong ( stabilizer or not ) , and the classification is essentially crisp with an entropy @xmath80 . with the further addition of edges ,",
    "the number of strong nodes starts to decrease as a result of the loss of stabilization , giving rise to the appearance of weak stabilizing and non - stabilizing nodes at @xmath81 .",
    "continuing to @xmath82 , the entropy of the classification remains very low because there still is a sizable number of strong nodes supported by a few weak and strong stabilizers ( see panels b and c in fig .",
    "[ fig : random ] ) . as",
    "further edges are added , the number of weak stabilizers starts to decrease as well , and eventually most of the nodes are weak and non - stabilizing , accounting for the quick rise in the classification entropy @xmath75 starting around @xmath82 .",
    "we focus now on some empirical examples to show the special role that the stabilizers play in a classification and the type of information that they convey while also highlighting the versatility of our analysis . as explained , classifications into two groups are particularly simple and in this case the stabilizers can be easily identified once a solution of the nl - em clustering is given .",
    "this simplicity makes them good candidates to illustrate the properties of the stabilizers .",
    "we present first two examples of this type that show the role of the stabilizers and the relations between them .",

    "the first example is a network built from the voting records of the @xmath86th us senate @xcite .",
    "the nodes represent senators that served the full two year term ( @xmath87 ) during which @xmath88 issues were voted . since our aim is to construct a network based on political affinity , we draw an edge between two senators if they voted in the same way at least once .",
    "the edges are weighted by the reciprocal of the number of co - voting senators minus one , a common practice for collaboration networks @xcite . in this way ,",
    "an agreement in minority on an issue has a higher value than that in an unanimous vote , differentiating more clearly close political standings . due to circumstantial quasi - unanimous votes ,",
    "the network is initially close to fully connected . a threshold such that edges with lower weights are removed can be introduced , and the resulting networks can be analyzed as the threshold increases .",
    "we have applied two - group nl - em to these networks .",
    "once the threshold is high enough , the clusters found follow well the divide between democrats and republicans .",
    "the instance in which about half of the senators , either republicans or democrats , are stabilizers is displayed in figure  [ fig : sen ] .",
    "congress roll calls and their derived networks have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting results is that single votes of a representative can be understood with a low dimensional spatial model ( dw - nominate @xcite ) in which a set of coordinates can be assigned to each congressman characterizing his / her political stand on the different issues .",
    "since the 90 s the number of dimensions required has been reduced in good approximation to only one that strongly correlates with the congressman s view on socio - economic questions ( liberal vs. conservative ) @xcite . in fig",
    "[ fig : sen ] , we show the relation between being a stabilizer and the location in the liberal - to - conservative dimension .",
    "the stabilizers tend to be the most radical members of the senate who are probably defining the overall position of their groups .",
    "this exercise can be repeated on networks obtained with different thresholds .",
    "it can be seen that as the threshold increases more and more nodes turn into stabilizers . keeping track of the senators that become stabilizers at different thresholds",
    "allows for a refined exploration of the political spectrum .",
    "note in particular that the above results have been obtained by simply looking at the co - voting relation and without considering the vote records in detail , _",
    "i.e. , the actual issue put to vote_.        in our second example we show how by extracting the sub - graph of stabilizers we can obtain from its structure useful information about what features distinguish a stabilizer node and how the groups relate in a classification .",
    "we consider a semantic network in which the nodes are adjectives and nouns occurring most frequently in charles dickens novel _ david copperfield _",

    "these two sub - groups bear the responsibility for the classification of remaining words by association .",
    "note that the only input to the nl - em method is the network .",
    "we are not introducing any bias for the partition in adjectives and nouns .",
    "most of the remaining words are well classified .",
    "the stabilizers , central to establishing the classification , are the words always occurring in strict combinations like _ true friends _ , never mixing with members of the same group and they form a bi - partite sub - graph of stabilizers as shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "fig : food ] b and c ) . or more correctly , the consistent choice of species a predator does not prey on is what renders them stabilizers .",
    "the possibility of classifying species in low dimensional spaces depending on their trophic level and on the intervality of their prey distribution has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "our stability analysis reveals an underling structure in the connectivity pattern of the foodweb , which is responsible for the success of these low dimensional models .",

    "we were able to show that a subset of nodes , the stabilizers , associated with a given grouping play a central role as they form the backbone of the classification which could not be attained without them .",
    "the mathematical basis behind the concept of stabilizers is rather intuitive and follows from the product form of the group assignment probabilities , @xmath5 , in eq .",

    "their identification is highly useful in understanding the way in which the structure of complex systems form and their elements aggregate in clusters .",
    "this technique has a wide applicability as we have shown with three empirical examples of networks of very different origins : social sciences , semantics and ecology .",
    "in addition it raises several important questions , such as the role of these special nodes in the evolution of any dynamic process running on the graph such as the spreading of opinions , rumors or diseases , or even in the evolution of the graph itself if the network is dynamic .",

    "given a network , the search for classifications of the nl - em algorithm was carried out using an algorithm that alternates between simulated annealing and a direct greedy iteration of eqs .",

    "we outline here the algorithm we have used to extract stabilizers from an nl - em classification with strong nodes .",
    "the problem of determining the set of stabilizers associated with a strong node is related to the set covering problem in computer science , which is np - complete .",
    "if a strong node has @xmath27 adjacent nodes with non - empty @xmath59 , there are in principle @xmath109 combinations that have to be checked for finding the fundamental sets leading to stabilizations . in practice , many of the combinations can be eliminated by observing that if , say , @xmath110 have been selected as candidates for a stabilization , any @xmath59 that is a subset of the union of the @xmath111 s is redundant and thus can not be part of that stabilization .",
    "this is the main strategy of our algorithm .",
    "also note that , if there are @xmath31 number of classes the number of possible distinct stabilizer sets @xmath59 is @xmath112 . for small @xmath31 , @xmath27 can be larger than @xmath113 so that there are duplicates which can be removed beforehand .",
    "we have used a recursive algorithm for detecting the stabilizers .",
    "we partially order the @xmath27 sets @xmath111 by their size .",
    "two binary arrays of size @xmath27 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 indicate the candidates already selected and those available for contribution to a stabilization , respectively .",
    "the classes against which the @xmath27 nodes stabilize are coded in an @xmath116 binary array @xmath117 , where the non - zero elements of @xmath118 $ ] indicate the classes against which node @xmath4 is stabilizing . a recursively called subroutine @xmath119 , givenin fig .",
    "a.1 in pseudo - code , performs the task of determining all stabilizations of a strong node , given the sets @xmath117 . in the algorithms",
    "we have assumed that there is already defined a procedure @xmath120 , which takes a list and returns the indices where the list element equals to @xmath121 along with the number of elements found @xmath122 .",
    "also in our notation when two lists are operated on term by term we denote this as @xmath123 \\gets listone [ * ] \\;\\ ; { \\rm < operator > } \\;\\ ; listtwo[*]$ ] , avoiding having to write out explicitly a loop over the operation on individual elements .    .",

    "a generalization of nl - em to directed graphs that preserves structural equivalence  @xcite was recently provided in our earlier work @xcite .",

    "we thus introduce the probabilities :    * @xmath128 that a directed link leaving a vertex of group @xmath2 connects to node @xmath4 , * @xmath129 that a directed link pointing to a node in group @xmath2 exists from @xmath4 , and * @xmath130 that a bidirectional link exiting from group @xmath2 connects to @xmath4 ,    and construct the probability of realizing a directed graph @xmath11 as @xmath131 ,    \\label{prob2}\\ ] ] @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 are the set of adjacent nodes of @xmath6 from which @xmath6 receives an in - coming , out - going , and bi - directional link , respectively .",

    "these expressions have to be again supplemented with the self - consistent equation for @xmath5 which now reads @xmath143    note that when we have only bi - directional links so that @xmath144 for all @xmath6 , and it follows from eq .",
