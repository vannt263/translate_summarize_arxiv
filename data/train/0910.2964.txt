    "supersymmetry is a theoretically attractive model for extention of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "it proposes that all the sm particles have susy partners with a spin difference of @xmath0 . among its motivations ; susy solves the fine - tuning problem ( higgs mass stabilization against loop corrections ) , susy modifies running of the sm gauge couplings just enough to give the grand unification at a single scale and susy also offers a candidate for dark matter through r - parity conservation .",
    "since susy partners of the sm particles have not been observed at the same mass scale susy must be a broken symmetry at low energy . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) brings more than a hundred free parameters into the theory ,",
    "thus searching for susy is a very challenging task .",
    "one of the main objectives for building the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to discover susy .",
    "the atlas ( a toroidal lhc apparatus ) and cms ( compact muon solenoid ) are two general purpose detectors at the lhc designed to search for susy particles ( and for the higgs boson ) .",
    "both experiments have successfully seen the first beam events in september 2008 and have been commissioning with the cosmic rays since then . the lhc is scheduled to start up in november 2009 .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments put enormous efforts recently to get ready for the analysis of the first lhc data .",
    "atlas has written a collection of notes published as a cern book  @xcite based on the results from the computer system commissioning ( csc ) exercise .",
    "cms has written a technical design report ii  @xcite .",
    "both have dedicated chapters to susy covering a broad spectrum in susy analyses with 14 tev center of mass energy .",
    "post - csc studies in atlas  @xcite and post - tdr studies in cms  @xcite have followed for both 14 tev and 10 tev center of mass energies resulting in a variety of public notes .",
    "this review article is based on these recent studies . after a brief mention of the susy search strategies at the lhc",
    ", examples of the data - driven methods will be given for estimating the sm backgrounds to susy searches .",
    "then searches with the inclusive missing transverse energy ( @xmath1 ) signatures and an exclusive search without explicity use of will be summarized .",
    "examples from special susy signatures of the non - standard susy models will be presented together with the discovery reach of some susy models .",
    "the article will conclude after a discussion on the susy mass measurements and determination of susy model parameters upon a possible susy discovery .",
    "the susy breaking mechanism determines the phenomenology and search strategy in the collider experiments .",
    "many possible mechanisms have been proposed ; msugra  @xcite , gmsb  @xcite , amsb  @xcite , so(10 ) susy guts  @xcite , split - susy  @xcite and others .",
    "the search strategies can be discussed in two classes of models :    1 .   standard susy models with r - parity conservation . in this class susy",
    "is searched for as an evidence of excess above the sm background in the following channels ; 0 , 1 , 2 leptons+@xmath2 2 , 3 , 4 jets+@xmath1 , @xmath3+jets+@xmath1 , @xmath4 or @xmath5-jets+@xmath1 , multi - leptons , multi - jets without and others .",
    "non - standard susy models with special signatures ; displaced vertices , stopped gluinos in the calorimeter , non - pointing photons , long - lived stable massive particles and others .    understanding the sm backgrounds play an essential role in susy searches .",
    "main sources of the sm backgrounds come from the following processes ; @xmath6+jets , @xmath7+jets , @xmath8+jets , qcd jets and diboson ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) production",
    ". the data - driven estimation of the sm backgrounds , will be an emphasis of early analyses .",
    "understanding the fake and tails in the distributions as well as the reconstruction of the non - standard signatures will be a critical task in the search for susy .",
    "several monte carlo - driven and data - driven estimation techniques have been developed to estimate the sm backgrounds . some of the data - driven estimation techniques are listed as :    * @xmath12 background in 0-lepton mode  @xcite . * qcd background in 0-lepton mode susy search using the jet smearing method  @xcite . * qcd background in 1-lepton mode susy search using the lepton isolation method  @xcite .",

    "others .    as an example two of the data - driven approaches are summarized below .",
    "the biggest background estimation challenge for susy searches in the jets+channels will be estimation of the qcd jet background .",
    "this background involves two sources of @xmath1 :    1 .",
    "fake @xmath1 ; non - gaussian tails to the detector jet response function arising from the dead material , jet punch - through , pile - up and other effects .",
    "it can be suppressed by applying the jet - azimuthal angle cuts , calorimeter and tracking cuts and cosmic background rejection cuts .",
    "2 .   real @xmath1 ; resulting from the non - interacting particles such as neutrinos or the lighest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "two approaches are taken to estimate the remaining qcd jet backgrounds ; monte carlo - driven estimates and data - driven estimates .",
    "the monte carlo based estimates are subject to large systematics effects arising from the proton parton distributions , underlying event uncertainties , jet energy scale uncertainty and an uncertainty in modeling the qcd jet physics with monte carlo generators ( pythia versus alpgen ) .",
    "there will also be an uncertainty from the luminosity measurement .",
    "in addition , the detector simulation uncertainties ( imperfect description of the response of the detector to jets ) and the statistical uncertainties ( large qcd cross section rendering production of full simulation samples unfeasible ) will contribute . as for the data - driven estimates they will be crucial in early phase of data taking as they are less prone to input systematics .    a method from an atlas study  @xcite is described here for estimating the qcd jet background in the 0-lepton mode susy search .",
    "the method makes use of smearing the jet transverse momenta in low qcd jet data with a data measured jet response function r ( ratio of the measured jet to the true jet @xmath14 ) .",
    "the gaussian part of the jet response function is measured with the balance of the @xmath3+jet events .",
    "the non - gaussian part of the jet response function is measured from the mercedes type of configuration ( is parallel or anti - parallel to the of one of the three jets selected in the event ) .",

    "can be made by these searches , the emphasis will move on to confirming that it is really susy .",
    "the masses and spins of the newly discovered particles should be measured and the underlying model parameters should be determined . since it is not possible to cover all of the allowed susy models ,",
    "msugra model is taken as an example to develop the mass measurement techniques that can be applicable to large variety of susy and susy - like models .",
    "the study presented here is based on an atlas study  @xcite performed for integrated luminosity of 1  fb@xmath15 at 14 tev .    the mass measurement strategy is to exploit kinematics of the long decay chains . in the r - parity conserving msugra models",
    "susy particles are pair produced and their cascade decays typically have high jets , leptons and large ( due to two invisible lsps in every susy event ) in the final states .",
    "no mass peaks can be reconstructed , however kinematic endpoints in the invariant mass distributions of dilepton , dijet , leptons+jets and ditau can be measured .",
    "these measurements are then used in deriving relations between susy masses .",
    "the theoretical positions of the endpoints are well known from the analytical expressions  @xcite . if sufficiently long decay chains can be isolated and enough endpoints can be measured then the masses of the susy particles involved in the decay can be obtained in a model - independent way . as an example from the decay chain : @xmath88 the masses of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath51 and @xmath91 can be measured .",
    "this is the first decay chain likely to be reconstructed as it has the advantage of having charged leptons , and hadronic jets in the final state which ensures a large signal to background ratio .",
    "also , the technique known as flavor subtraction allows to determine both the susy combinatorial and the sm background from the data itself with high accuracy .",
    "this technique exploits the fact that the signal contains two opposite - sign same - flavor ( ossf ) leptons , while the background is due to pair of leptons coming from different decay chains , which can be of the same - flavor ( sf ) or opposite - flavor ( of ) with the same probability .",
    "thus the background cancels in the substraction @xmath92 where @xmath93 indicates the respective number of events and @xmath94 is the ratio of the electron and muon reconstruction efficiencies ( @xmath94=0.86 for this study ) .      starting with the two leptons ( electron or muon ) in the final state ,",
    "the invariant mass distribution of dilepton exhibits a triangular shape with an endpoint at : @xmath95 in figure  [ dilep ] , the dilepton invariant mass distribution is shown after flavor subtraction applied for the atlas benchmark point su3 .",
    "the line histogram shows the small sm background contribution ( dominated by @xmath6+jets ) , while the points are the sum of sm and susy contributions .",
    "a clear excess is seen together with a clear edge structure .",
    "the distribution is fitted with a triangle smeared with a gaussian which is superimposed in the plot .",
    "also , the expected ( truth ) position of the endpoint is indicated by a vertical dashed line .",
    "the fitted endpoint is @xmath96  gev where the first error is statistical and the second is the systematic error on the lepton energy scale and the @xmath94 parameter ( 10% ) . compared to its truth value of 100.2  gev ( calculated from eq .",

    "different distributions and lines are explained in the text.,width=302 ]    in order to determine the masses of all the susy particles involved in the decay chain , further kinematic endpoints need to be measured from the mass distributions involving a jet : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the label thr indicates lower endpoint of the distribution ( a non - zero threshold value ) whereas low / high indicate minimum / maximum of the two masses @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "only the two leading jets are considered in event selection as it is not possible to identify the quark from the @xmath89 decay .",
    "therefore it is assumed that it hadronizes into one of the two highest @xmath103 jets in the event .",
    "the fitted endpoints together with their truth values can be seen in table  [ fitresult ] .",
    "the first error is statistical , the second and third are the lepton energy scale uncertainty and the jet energy scale uncertainty , respectively . while the measured values are compatible with their truth values , there are large uncertainties on the measured values .",
    "this is due to not having clear edge structure ( combinatorics from choosing the wrong jet in a true susy event ) and thus trying to fit the tails ( beyond the endpoint ) with straight lines .",
