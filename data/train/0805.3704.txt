    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has given the scientific comunity an unprecedented chance to systematically map a large area of the sky , using its own special 5-band filter system . in the process",
    ", an overwhelming amount of data has been ammassed , which can be used to perform many different types of scientific studies .",
    "of particular interest to us is the fact that the sdss has also provided , with unprecedented detail , a map of the spatial distribution of different stellar populations accross the galaxy , which is increasingly being used to trace new structures in the galactic halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some of which may plausibly be related to the hundreds of elusive `` protogalactic fragments '' that are predicted , in the @xmath9cdm cosmological paradigm , to have given birth to a galaxy like the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this sense ,",
    "rr lyrae stars have proven to be a stellar component that is consistently present in most , and possibly all , of these structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "light curves for many variable stars in the sdss filter system have been provided by the sdss  ii survey , a 3-year extension of the original sdss survey , with images of the same fields taken every other night , with the main goal to detect supernovae explosions .",
    "however , it remains at present difficult to obtain reliable distances therefrom , since so far no detailed study of the properties of rr lyrae stars in the sdss system has been performed , with the notable exception of @xcite . in the same vein ,",
    "it is still not possible at present to directly extract reliable distance information from detailed rr lyrae light curves obtained in the sdss system , as are now becoming increasingly common ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".            accordingly , the purpose of the present study is to provide the first systematic investigation of the rr lyrae period - luminosity ( pl ) relation in the bandpasses of the sdss system , which should enable the determination of more reliable distances to individual rr lyrae stars for which data in the sdss system are available than has been possible thus far .",
    "this paper presents an extension of the work by @xcite , who obtained such a pl relation for the @xmath10 passbands of the johnson - cousins - glass photometric system , and by @xcite , who studied the pl relations in the strmgren system .",
    "its structure is quite similar to that in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we begin by presenting , in  2 , the theoretical framework upon which our study is based . in  3 , we explain the origin of the derived pl relations , whose calibrations are provided in  4 .",
    "some final remarks are provided in  6 .",
    "in order to derive the pl relations , we computed a series of horizontal branch ( hb ) simulations , following recipes similar to those presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used the evolutionary tracks given by @xcite and @xcite for @xmath11 . the main - sequence helium abundance by mass is assumed to be @xmath12 , and solar - scaled compositions are adopted .",
    "@xcite argue that these models are consistent with a distance modulus to the large magellanic cloud of @xmath13  mag .",
    "note , however , that this value is based on the empirical prescriptions for the lmc by @xcite ; using the independent measurements by @xcite , a distance modulus of @xmath14  mag would derive instead .",
    "the mass distribution is assumed to be a normal deviate , with a mass dispersion of @xmath15 @xmath16 . in order to pass from the theoretical @xmath17 plane to the empirical ones in which the magnitudes in the sdss photometric system ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) are used ,",
    "we have incorporated the bolometric corrections from @xcite to the code , over the relevant ranges of temperature and gravity .",
    "the blue edge of the instability strip is computed as prescribed by @xcite , but with a shift of @xmath21 k applied to the resulting temperatures to provide better agreement with recent prescriptions @xcite .",
    "the instability strip width is taken as @xmath22 , which gives us the temperature of the red edge of the instability strip once the blue edge position has been found .",
    "when a star lies between the blue and red edges , its period is calculated based on equation  ( 4 ) of @xcite .",
    "therefore , our relations are directly applicable to fundamental - mode ( i.e. , rrab or rr0 ) stars , but the observed periods of first - overtone ( rrc or rr1 ) stars must first be `` fundamentalized '' according to the relation @xmath23 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) before comparing with our results .",
    "in this paper we are interested in finding pl relations for rr lyrae stars in the sdss system . to properly take into account the impact of variations in hb morphology , for each of the four studied metallicities we computed extensive series of hb simulations , including hb types that range from very red to very blue .",
    "this leads to a total of 423,766 synthetic rr lyrae stars that cover a wide range in metallicity and hb types .",
    "these stars are then used to search for possible pl relations , as described in the next sections .",

    "as discussed in @xcite , the expected pl relation must be tighter towards the redder passbands ( especially in the near - infrared ) , compared to the visual bands .",
    "the effects of temperature and luminosity on the periods affect strongly the shape of the resulting pl relation . in order to better appreciate this , recall that , from the period - mean density relation or ritter s relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , periods increase strongly with both an increase in luminosity and a _ decrease _ in temperature . while the luminosities of rr lyrae stars are remarkably uniform for a given metallicity and hb type , the introduction of filters , with their often strongly temperature - dependent bolometric corrections , may add strong slopes to the otherwise `` horizontal '' branch .",
    "thus in @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the cooler stars appear fainter than the bluer ones ; conversely , in the redder passbands ( @xmath20 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) , the cooler stars are the ones that appear brighter . since the cooler / more luminous stars are the ones with longer periods , the end result is that the pl relation will appear increasingly tighter towards the redder passbands , the inverse happening towards the bluer passbands ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "this behavior is confirmed in figure  [ fig : genmag ] ( _ top row _ ) , where we show the changes in the absolute magnitude - log - period space , for hb simulations computed for a rather even hb morphology , a metallicity of @xmath176 , and each of the @xmath0 sdss passbands .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained for other metallicity values and hb morphologies as well .",
    "as can be clearly seen , it is only when the redder bandpasses of the sdss sytem   namely , @xmath1 and @xmath2   are used that one begins to find relatively tight , simple pl relations .",
    "this behavior is in total agreement with the previous results by @xcite , who had similarly found that , in the case of the johnson - cousins - glass system , such simple pl relations are present only for @xmath177 and redder bandpasses .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the originally very poor pl relations in the @xcite filter system become exceedingly tight when ( fairly reddening - independent ) strmgren `` pseudo - color '' @xmath178 terms are incorporated into these relations .",
    "can something similar be accomplished , in the case of the sdss system ?    to answer this question ,",
    "we have searched for a combination of blue and red sdss colors that might also prove relatively reddening - free .",
    "we used the extinctions provided online by d. schlegel,[multiblock footnote omitted ] according to which one has @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 . on this basis , we find that a `` pseudo - color '' defined as    @xmath184    turns out to be fairly reddening - insensitive , with the unreddened ( @xmath185 ) and reddened ( @xmath186 ) quantities being related by the following equation :    @xmath187    that by incorporating such @xmath185-dependent terms can indeed lead to much tighter pl - pseudo - color ( plpsc ) relations is confirmed by figure  [ fig : genmag ] ( _ bottom row _ ) , which shows the enormous improvement over the situation in which no such terms are included ( fig .  [ fig : genmag ] , _ top row _ ) .",
    "in the course of our research we noticed that tight period-_color_-pseudo - color ( pcpsc ) relations also obtain , when one includes such @xmath185-dependent terms .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure  [ fig : gencol ] .",
    "color as opposed to @xmath188 , since we have found that the latter presents a complex , non - linear behavior as a function of @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "this is also the reason why , in equation  [ eq : simpuz ] below , we provide a simple linar fit for @xmath8 , rather than @xmath188 , as a function of @xmath190 and @xmath191 . ] as a matter of fact , such relations are even tighter than the corresponding plpsc ones .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we shall directly provide our theoretically calibrated plpsc relation in a single bandpass , namely @xmath2 ( which provides us with the highest correlation coefficient of all the sdss filters ) , electing to provide pcpsc relations involving the remainder of the sdss filters , due to their higher correlation coefficients . from the provided plpsc relation in @xmath2 and the pcpsc relations , one can straightforwardly derive plpsc relations for all other individual sdss bandpasses .",
    "the final relations that we obtained are thus of the form :    @xmath192    where `` mag '' stands for the absolute magnitude in @xmath2 , whereas `` color '' represents any of the colors @xmath188 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath193 . in this expression , @xmath194 is the sdss system s pseudo - color [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : psc ] ) ] , and @xmath195 is the fundamentalized rr lyrae period ( in days ) .",
    "the corresponding coefficients , along with their errors , are given in table  [ tab : coef ] .",
    "( naturally , the @xmath54 coefficient that appears in this table is _ not _ the same as the pseudo - color @xmath185 , which is given in capital letters throughout this paper to avoid confusion . )",
    "we stress that these equations are able to reproduce the input values ( from the hb simulations ) with high precision .",
    "this is shown in table  [ tab : qual ] , where the correlation coefficient @xmath20 and the standard error of the estimate are given for each of the four equations .",
    "we also show , in figures  [ fig : resz ] , [ fig : resumg ] , [ fig : resgmr ] , [ fig : resrmi ] , and [ fig : resimz ] , the residuals [ in the sense eq .",
    "( [ eq : fits ] ) minus input values ( from the simulations ) ] for a random subset of 6000 synthetic stars drawn from the original pool of 423,766 synthetic rr lyrae stars in the hb simulations , for the fits computed for @xmath2 , @xmath188 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath193 , respectively .",
    "these plots further illustrate that the sdss magnitudes and colors can be predicted from the data provided in equation  ( [ eq : fits ] ) and table  [ tab : coef ] with a precision that is generally at the level of 0.01  mag ( or better , especially at low metallicities ) .",
    "finally , we note that equation  ( [ eq : fits ] ) can be trivially expressed in terms of [ fe / h ] ; this can be accomplished using the relation    @xmath196 } - 1.765 ,   \\label{eq : logz}\\ ] ]    which is the same as equation  ( 9 ) in @xcite . in this sense , the effects of an enhancement in @xmath197-capture elements with respect to a solar - scaled mixture , such as observed amongst galactic halo stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , can be taken into account by using the following scaling relation @xcite :    @xmath198 } = { \\rm [ fe / h ] } + \\log ( 0.638\\,f + 0.362 ) ,   \\label{eq : maur}\\ ] ]    where @xmath199}$ ] .",
    "however , such a relation should be used with due care for metallicities @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the rr lyrae plpsc relation in the sdss system on the adopted width of the mass distribution , as well as on the helium abundance , has been analyzed by computing additional sets of synthetic hb s for @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) and for a main - sequence helium abundance of 28% ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath204 variations was found to be negligible ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ? * for similar results in the case of the johnson - cousins - glass and strmgren systems , respectively ) , but helium turned out to have a more important influence ( again as previously found in the other filter systems ) .",
    "the results are shown in figures  [ fig : hiyz ] ( plpsc relation in @xmath2 ) and [ fig : hiycol ] ( plpsc relations ) .",
    "in the case of @xmath205 , there is a clear offset in the zero point , as well as an increased dispersion in comparison with figure  [ fig : hiyz ] .",
    "still , the standard deviation remains a modest @xmath206  mag   to be compared with the actual dispersion in @xmath205 magnitudes from the hb simulations for a fixed @xmath207 , which amounts to a full 1.25  mag ( i.e. , @xmath205 values for individual rr lyrae stars range from 0.97  mag at their faintest to @xmath208  mag at their brightest ) , in the @xmath209 case .",
    "therefore , if a correction to the zero point @xmath24 for @xmath205 in table  [ tab : coef ] [ and also in eq .",
    "( [ eq : simpz ] ) below ] by @xmath210 [ i.e. , in the sense that eq .",
    "( [ eq : fits ] ) predicts too faint magnitudes ] is duly taken into account , equation  ( [ eq : fits ] ) [ and similarly eq .",
    "( [ eq : simpz ] ) below ] can also be used to provide useful information on the absolute magnitudes of rr lyrae stars with enhanced helium abundances .                          as in @xcite , and for the bandpasses that show sufficiently tight pl relations ( i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : genmag ] ) , we have computed average pl relations that do not show an explicit dependence on @xmath185 .",
    "the goal here is to enable an application of our derived pl relations even when observations in the bluer passbands of the sdss system are not available .",
    "we do provide , however , simple relations for _ colors _ involving such bluer bandpasses .",
    "the resulting relations are as follows :    @xmath211    with a correlation coefficient @xmath212 and a standard error of the estimate of 0.037  mag ;    @xmath213    with a correlation coefficient @xmath214 and a standard error of the estimate of 0.045  mag ;    @xmath215    with a correlation coefficient @xmath214 and a standard error of the estimate of 0.013  mag ;    @xmath216    with a correlation coefficient @xmath214 and a standard error of the estimate of 0.027  mag ; and    @xmath217    with a correlation coefficient @xmath214 and a standard error of the estimate of 0.045  mag .",
    "note that , as a consequence of the large number of stars involved in the fits , the errors in all of the derived coefficient are very small ( of order @xmath218 ) .",
    "we performed tests in which quadratic terms were added to these equations , but in no case was the improvement of major significance , the standard errors of the estimates generally changing only in the third decimal place .",
    "when applying our equation  ( [ eq : fits ] ) in globular cluster work , the metallicity of the cluster will often be known a priori .",
    "however , metallicity estimates may also be unavailable , especially when dealing with field rr lyrae stars . yet , for a reliable application of our relations to field stars , an estimate of their metallicities must be provided .",
    "the sdss system itself may itself come to our rescue in such a case .",
    "we recall that estimates of the rr lyrae metallicities can be obtained on the basis of their @xmath219-band light curves using fourier decomposition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "one finds the following :    @xmath220    with a @xmath221  mag , and    @xmath222    with a @xmath223  mag .",
    "thus , on the basis of @xmath219-band light curves computed from sdss @xmath18- and @xmath19- ( or , alternatively , @xmath19- and @xmath20- ) band magnitudes , one should be able to estimate metallicities for individual rr lyrae stars , through fourier decomposition .",
    "we note , in addition , that in a forthcoming paper ( catelan & cceres 2008 , in preparation ) we will be providing analytical fits that should allow one to estimate metallicity values directly from the sdss photometry .    .",
