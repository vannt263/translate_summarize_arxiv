    "electromagnetic ( em ) transients associated with gravitational wave bursts ( gwbs ) have not been confidently detected , although associations of weak em counterparts with these gw events were claimed ( connaughton et al .",
    "2016 ) . since the two gw events are believed to be from bh - bh systems , it is still highly debated whether or not the merger of a bh@xmath6bh system can be accompanied by an em counterpart ( zhang 2016 ; zhang et al 2016 ; connaughton et al .",

    "ns - ns mergers as the progenitors of sgrbs have been extensively studied .",
    "depending on the nascent ns mass ( @xmath7 ) , two possible outcomes of the merger are expected .",
    "one possibility is a black hole , which forms when @xmath7 is much greater than the maximum non - rotating mass ( @xmath8 , rosswog et al .",
    "2003 ; rezzolla et al .",
    "2011 ; ravi & lasky 2014 ) .",
    "another possibility is a rapidly spinning , strongly magnetized neutron star ( `` millisecond magnetar '' ) , in the case where @xmath7 is less than @xmath8 but greater than @xmath9 ( the maximum gravitational mass ) ( usov 1992 ; thompson 1994 ; dai & lu 1998a , b ; zhang & mszros 2001 ; metzger et al .",

    "the post - merger evolution of magnetars also depends on the mass lying between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "one possible channel is a magnetar in an equilibrium state which injects energy from the magnetar wind via loss of rotation energy for @xmath10 ( giacomazzo & perna 2013 ) .",
    "this well explains the long lasting energy injection phase observed with the swift x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows et al .",
    "another evolving channel is that of a supra - massive ns , which may survive if @xmath11 , when magnetic braking and viscosity compel the star into uniform rotation . as the period of the magnetar decreases via rotational energy loss , the maximum gravitational mass decreases .",
    "the magnetar collapses into a black hole when its centrifugal force can not balance the gravitational force ( duez et al .",
    "2006 ; ravi & lasky 2014 ) .",
    "theoretically , it is expected that a poynting - flux dominated outflow is driven by the injected wind as the magnetar spins down ( e.g. dai & lu 1998a ; zhang & mszros 2001 ) . the observed x - ray `` internal plateau '' ( the rapid flux drop off at the end of the plateau emission with a decay slope @xmath12 ) . ] with xrt in a few long and short grbs ( troja et al .",

    "the rapid decay following the plateau can not be accommodated in any external shock model and can be attributed to internal dissipation of a central engine wind , which is likely a signature of the collapse of a supra - massive magnetar central engine into a black hole ( troja et al .",

    ", it is predicted that em signals can not be avoided after the merger due to the high magnetic field strength at the ns surface ( metzger & berger 2012 ) .",

    "2013 ; lasky et al . 2014",

    "therefore , hunting for possible associations of sgrbs with gw events is interesting .",
    "the ligo team has searched for such associations for many years , but no events have been reported . comparing the bh - bh mergers with the associated gwbs detected with the advanced - ligo ,",
    "the energy lost via gwb in these systems would be much larger than that expected in ns - ns merger systems ( corsi & mszros 2009 ; hild et al . 2011 ; fan et al .",

    "the characteristic spin - down luminosity is essentially the plateau luminosity , which may be estimated as @xmath75    based on equation ( [ l0 ] ) and equation ( [ tau ] ) , one can derive the magnetar parameters @xmath65 and @xmath64 : @xmath76 @xmath77 using the lower limit of @xmath59 we derive upper limits for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are respectively @xmath78 s and @xmath79 g. figure 6a shows the @xmath80 diagram for grb 160821b , and compares other short grbs .",

    "the total isotropic - equivalent electromagnetic energy ( @xmath140-ray energy , internal plateau energy , and kinetic energy ) is much less than the energy budget of the magnetar ( a few @xmath141 ) , suggesting that the missing energy of the supra - massive magnetar may be radiated via gravitational waves , or carried into the black hole before spin down .",
    "if it is indeed that the energy dissipated via gravitational waves , one can constrain the ellipticity of the ns to @xmath4 .",
    "also , the upper limit of the gravitational wave strain can be estimated as @xmath142 at @xmath132 , which is below the advanced - ligo noise curve , but may be detectable by einstein telescope in the future .",
    "if we shift this source to @xmath143 cosmological distance ( @xmath136 ) , then the gravitational wave signal could be detected by the current advanced - ligo .",
    "the event rate density of sgrbs depends on the minimum luminosity threshold .",
    "given the detectability horizon of advanced - ligo , i.e. a distance of 100 @xmath144 , all the observed sgrbs are above the bat sensitivity .",
    "following the method of sun et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , if we consider the minimum isotropic luminosity of the observed sgrbs , which gives an event rate of @xmath145 above @xmath146 and varies by a factor less than two for different delay timescale models , we estimate there are 2 sgrbs every one hundred years within 100 @xmath144 .",
    "this is quite small and consistent with the non - detection of any sgrbs accompanying detected gw events .",
    "it is also possible that there may be low - luminosity sgrbs extending to a luminosity of @xmath147 , which is the detection limit for _",
    "swift_/bat for sgrbs at 100 @xmath144 .",
    "the estimated event rate density above this luminosity threshold is much larger than that of the @xmath146 luminosity threshold . in this case",
    ", one may expect one low luminosity sgrb every two years .",
    "however , this is quite speculative as we have not seen any low luminosity sgrbs yet .",
    "we have already had a few such cases for lgrbs .",
    "both of the two cases can be tested with future detections . for current circumstances ,",
    "the first scenario is preferred .",
    "on the other hand for ns - ns mergers a more isotropic , sub - relativistic outflow could be ejected during a neutron - rich merger which can synthesize heavier radioactive elements via r - process .",
    "a thermal uv - optical transient may be powered by radioactive decay except the short grb and its x - ray afterglow ( li & paczynski 1998 ; rezzolla et al .",
    "2011 ; yu et al .",
    "2013 ) . however , if the post - merger product is a supra - massive ns supported by rigid rotation , e.g. grb 160821b , the spin - down magnetic dipole radiation of the ns remnant provides an additional energy source to the ejecta .",
    "this optical transient ( li - paczynski - nova , macro - nova , kilo - nova , merger - nova , r - process ) emission component would be significantly enhanced since it is heated by the magnetar wind and could easily exceed the r - process power ( li & paczynski 1998 ; tanvir et al . 2013 ; berger et al .",

    "; yang et al . 2015 ; gao , zhang & l 2016 ; gao et al .",
    "2016 ) . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", it is expected that the optical or near - infrared bump is detected at late time or an excess of flux would be visible in the spectral energy distribution .",
    "one can use the properties of observed merger - nova to constrain the parameters of the central engine .",
    "however , due to lack of optical observations , catching the possible merger - nova is expected by following up with an optical instrument in the future , i.e. hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
