    "in 1989 , witten @xcite introduced a series of knot and 3-manifold invariants based on a quantum field theory with the chern - simons lagrangian .",
    "witten defined these invariants starting with a compact simple lie group , the gauge group of the theory , and defining a path integral for each 3-manifold as well as for knots and links in such a 3-manifold .",
    "the case most intensively studied is that where the gauge group is @xmath0 , which is related to the jones polynomial of knots @xcite .",
    "witten pointed out that the case where the gauge group is @xmath1 ( abelian chern - simons theory ) is related to the linking number of knots and to classical theta functions . here and",
    "below we use the term `` classical '' not in the complex analytical distinction between classical and canonical , but to specify the classical theta functions as opposed to the non - abelian ones .",
    "abelian chern - simons theory was studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our interest was renewed by the discovery , in @xcite , that all constructs of abelian chern - simons theory can be derived from the theory of theta functions .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite it was shown that the action of the heisenberg group on theta functions discovered by a. weil , and the action of the modular group lead naturally to manifold invariants .",
    "the current paper follows the same line .",
    "it has a two - fold goal .",
    "first , we describe the quantum group of abelian chern - simons theory which , to our knowledge , has not been studied before .",
    "the intuition for the construction comes from the properties of theta functions .",
    "second , we interpret the classical theta functions , the action of the heisenberg group , and the action of the modular group in terms of vertex models using this quantum group .",
