    "in the literature , many papers about free convection in fluid saturated porous media study the case of the semi - infinite vertical flat plate in the framework of boundary layer approximations . this approach allows to introduce similarity variables to reduce the whole system of partial differential equations into one single ordinary differential equation of the third order with appropriate boundary values .",
    "this two points boundary value problem can be studied using a shooting method or an auxiliary dynamical system either in the case of prescribed temperature or in the case of prescribed heat flux along the plate .    in this article we first present the derivation of the equations ,",
    "show how the boundary layer approximation leads to the two points boundary value problem and the similarity solutions , then we rewrite the full problem of free convection in a two - dimensional bounded domain filled with a fluid saturated porous medium .",
    "this new model , written in terms of stream function and temperature , consists in two strongly coupled partial differential equations .",
    "we establish the existence and uniqueness of its solution for small data .",
    "let us consider a semi - infinite vertical permeable or impermeable flat plate embedded in a fluid saturated porous medium at the ambient temperature @xmath0 , and a rectangular cartesian co - ordinates system with the origin fixed at the leading edge of the vertical plate , the @xmath1-axis directed upward along the plate and the @xmath2-axis normal to it . if we suppose that the porous medium is homogeneous and isotropic , that all the properties of the fluid and the porous medium are constants and that the fluid is incompressible and follows the darcy - boussinesq law we obtain the following governing equations @xmath3",
    "@xmath6 @xmath7 in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the darcy velocities in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the density , viscosity and thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid , @xmath13 is the permeability of the saturated porous medium , @xmath14 is its thermal diffusivity , @xmath15 is the pressure , @xmath16 the temperature and @xmath17 the acceleration of the gravity .",
    "the subscript @xmath18 is used for values taken far from the plate . in our system of co - ordinates there are two main interesting sets of boundary conditions along the plate .",
    "first , the temperature is prescribed on the wall that gives @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    secondly , the heat flux is prescribed along the plate that leads to @xmath22 with @xmath20 , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is the mass transfer coefficient . for an impermeable wall we have @xmath24 , and for a permeable wall , @xmath25 corresponds to fluid suction and @xmath26 to fluid injection .",

    "assuming that convection takes place in a thin layer around the plate , we obtain the boundary layer approximation @xmath35 @xmath36 with the same boundary conditions ( [ bp1 ] ) or ( [ bp2 ] ) and ( [ bf ] ) as before .    for the case of prescribed heat , introducing the new dimensionless similarity variables @xmath37 with @xmath38 the local rayleigh number , equations ( [ epsi ] ) and ( [ t ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ bp1 ] ) and ( [ bf ] ) leads to the third order ordinary differential equations @xmath39 on @xmath40 subjected to @xmath41 where @xmath42 one can find explicit solutions of this problem for some particular values of @xmath43 or @xmath44 in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for mathematical results about existence , nonexistence , uniqueness , nonuniqueness and asymptotic behavior ,",

    ", we introduce the new dimensionless similarity variables @xmath46 and the rayleigh number @xmath47 then , equations ( [ epsi ] ) and ( [ t ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ bp2])-([bf ] ) give @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 the study of existence , uniqueness and qualitative properties of the solutions of this problem is made in @xcite . for a survey of the two cases ,",

    "the case of mixed convection @xmath52 with @xmath53 is interesting too and results about it can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
