    "accretion onto stellar black hole is the most widely accepted scenario for reproducing the different spectra in black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "generally , there are two basic spectral states , i.e. the high / soft state and the low / hard state ( esin et al . 1997 ; van de klis 1994 ; nowak 1995 ; tanaka & lewin 1995 ; tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ; for reviews see remillard & mcclintock 2006 and done et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the high / soft state ,",
    "the accretion occurs dominantly via a cool , optically thick disk ( pringle & rees 1972 ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ; frank et el . 2002 ) , while in the low / hard state , the accretion dominantly via a hot , optically thin advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) or radiative inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) ( rees et al . 1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a , b ; abramowicz et al . 1995 ; narayan 2005 ; kato et al .",
    "detailed fits to the observational spectra show that in the high / soft state the disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , while in the low / hard state , the disk truncates at some radius , and from the truncation radius inward the disk is replaced by an adaf or riaf ( kawabata & mineshige 2010 ) .",
    "the spectra in the low / hard state is characterized by a hard power law ( @xmath4 ) peaking at @xmath5 100 kev , and sometimes accompanied by a low - temperature thermal component ( esin et al .",
    "2001 ; mcclintock et al . 2001",
    "; done et al .",
    "the hard power - law component is believed to be produced by the inner hot adaf or riaf , and the thermal component by the truncated disk ( esin et al .",
    "2001 ; done et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "several theoretical models are proposed to be potential mechanisms for the disk truncation in the low / hard state for black hole x - ray binaries ( honma 1996 ; meyer , liu & meyer - hofmeister 2000b ; manmoto & kato 2000 ; lu et al .",

    "the disk - corona evaporation model ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; meyer et al . 2000a , b ; liu et al .",
    "2002a ) can naturally explain the transition between the outer thin disk and the inner adaf / riaf .",
    "the interaction between the disk and the corona leads to mass evaporating from the disk to the corona . when the mass accretion rate in the disk is lower than the evaporation rate from the disk to the corona , the disk is truncated . for given mass of black hole and accretion rate ,",
    "the truncation radius is determined by the evaporation model .",
    "therefore , we can calculated the radiative spectra from the inner adaf , the outer disk and corona .    thanks to the rapid progress of the observational techniques ,",
    "more detailed data for the multi - wavelength spectra are available for studying the evolution of the truncation radius of the disk with mass accretion rate in black hole x - ray binaries ( cabanac et al .",
    "the evolution of x - ray spectra with mass accretion rate has been also investigated in both agns and black hole x - ray binaries ( esin et al .",

    "; wu et al . 2008 ; liu et al . 2009 ) . here ,",
    "for the first time , we calculate the emergent spectra from the disk and corona , and the inner adaf caused by the mass evaporation .",
    "we then compare the theoretical spectra of our model for different mass accretion rates with observations .    in this work ,",
    "we perform more detailed calculations to study the evaporation and disk truncation in the low / hard state .",
    "both the cooling by compton scattering of the disk photons and the magnetic field are included to calculate the evaporation rates , which makes our solution more self - consistent .",
    "we obtain a fitting formula for the truncation radius as a function of mass accretion rates .",
    "then , we calculate the emergent spectra from the inner adaf , the outer disk and corona for different mass accretion rates .",
    "the dependence of the hard x - ray photon index on the mass accretion rate is derived . from the theoretical spectra",
    ", we find an anti - correlation between the eddington ratio @xmath1 and the hard x - ray photon index @xmath2 , which is consistent with observations for the black hole x - ray binary xte j1118 + 480 ( wu et al .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the disk - corona model . in section 3",
    "we present the numerical results , and in section 4 comparison with observations .",
    "the discussions and conclusions are given in section 5 and section 6 .",
    "we consider a hot corona above a geometrically thin standard disk around a central black hole . in the corona",
    ", viscous dissipation leads to ion heating , which is partially transferred to the electrons by means of coulomb collisions .",
    "this energy is then conducted down into lower , cooler and denser corona .",
    "if the density in this layer is sufficiently high , the conductive flux is radiated away .",
    "if the density is too low to efficiently radiate the energy , cool matter is heated up and evaporation into the corona takes place .",
    "the mass evaporation goes on until an equilibrium density is established .",
    "the gas evaporating into the corona still retains angular momentum and with the role of viscosity will differentially rotate around the central object . by friction the gas looses angular momentum and",
    "drifts inward thus continuously drains mass from the corona towards the central object .",
    "this is compensated by a steady mass evaporation flow from the underlying disk .",
    "the process is driven by the gravitational potential energy released by friction in the form of heat in the corona . therefore , mass is accreted to the central object partially through the corona ( evaporated part ) and partially through the disk ( the left part of the supplying mass ) .",

    "taking into account the compton effect , we calculate the evaporation rates for a series of accretion rates . for @xmath74 ,",

    "the truncated disk corona plus adaf geometry described above corresponds to the low / hard state .    in order to check whether the inner adaf solution can connect with the outer disk - corona solution smoothly , we take @xmath86 as an example to demonstrate the distribution of the temperature along radial direction . the thin disk truncates at about @xmath85 for @xmath87 . from figure 3",

    "however , the electron temperature of the outer corona is lower than that of the inner adaf ( the dotted line ) .",
    "this can be understood as follows . because of the presence of the cool thin disk underneath , the cooling of the corona by electron thermal conduction between the corona and the underlying thin disk is much more efficient than that of the radiative cooling , thereby leads to a lower electron temperature of the corona than that of the adaf .",
    "with increase of the mass accretion rate further for @xmath89 , the evaporation rate decreases severely .",

    "the viscosity parameter can also affect the critical transition rate ( meyer - hofmeister et al .",
    "2001 ; qiao & liu 2009 ) . for a larger value , @xmath158",
    ", the hard state extends to higher accretion rates , @xmath159 . in this case",
    ", the distribution of photon index as a function of accretion rate , as shown in figure 6 , can not be changed much at low accretion rates ( @xmath160 ) or low luminosities since the truncation radius is large and hence the emitting spectrum is dominated by the inner adaf . however , at high accretion rates ( from @xmath161 up to the state transition rate ) , the disk is truncated at smaller radii , which could result in softer photon index than that shown in figure 6 . for a smaller viscosity , @xmath162 , the disk is truncated at larger distances .",
    "the spectrum is hardly affected at any given accretion rates .",
    "only the lower limit of the photon index ( see figure 6 ) is larger because the predicted transition rate is lower .",
    "the observation of xte j1650 - 500 ( miller et al .",
    "2002 ; miniutti et al . 2004 ) and gx 339 - 4 ( miller et al . 2006a ; b ) demonstrates that the smeared iron line and reflection feature in the low / hard state are inconsistent with disk truncation .",
    "the claimed broadening and skewed iron line , which may be caused by the doppler shift and strong general relativistic effect , require that the thin disk extends to the isco ( fabian et al . 2000 ; miller 2007 ; done et al .",
    "recently , the condensation of matter from a hot corona to a cool , optically thick innermost disk is proposed for black hole transient systems in the low / hard state ( meyer et al .",
    "2007 ; liu et al .",
    "2007 ; taam et al .",
    "this model may alleviate the contradiction that a thin disk exists near isco in the low / hard state .",
    "present observational technique can not directly diagnose whether the thin disk truncates at some radius or not ( young et al . 2000 ; @xmath163 et al .",
    "further more advanced instruments are expected to solve this problem .",
    "in this work , we investigate the spectral features of accretion flows composed of an outer cool , optically thick disk and inner hot , optically thin , advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) within the framework of disk and corona with mass evaporation .",
    "the disk is truncated at the distance where the evaporation rate equals to the accretion rate ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we show the disk evaporation mechanism can connect the outer disk and the inner adaf / riaf smoothly .",
    "we calculate the emergent spectra of the disk and corona with mass evaporation in the low / hard state for different mass accretion rates . from the theoretical spectra",
    ", we find an anti - correlation between the eddington ratio @xmath164 and the hard x - ray photon index @xmath2 , which agrees well with the observations for the black hole x - ray binary xte j1118 + 480 .",
    "+ we would like to thank marat gilfanov , f. meyer and e. meyer - hofmeister for their promising discussion .",
