    "nonetheless the spin - wavefronts directions remain the same , implying that the overlap of the modes never rises .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider how the atoms carry the information contained in the spin - waves . in our scheme",
    "any atom is potentially carrying information about each illuminated mode .",
    "this situation can be opossed to @xcite where the atomic cloud was divided into 12 memories one next to the other . in that experiment , where spatial , not angular modes were used ,",
    "the total number of atoms was practically split to form twelve separate ensembles .",
    "it is noteworthy that with the configuration from @xcite , after very long storage times the atoms from one spatial region may diffuse to neighboring spatial regions .    with the same thermal speed of atoms or diffusion coefficient @xmath114 both methods ( our and that presented in @xcite ) give the same od for the same number of modes for the same storage time .",
    "in our method the ensemble diameter is divided by the number of modes to get the maximal distance the atoms can travel before the highest mode is washed out . if multiple separate ensembles are used , the diameter of each has to be smaller than this distance . thus the atoms have to fill the same cross section area , leading to the same od .",

    "<S> the present technology of spdc sources is well developed and widespread since , while operating in room temperatures , it offers high brightness and renders low noise . </S>",
