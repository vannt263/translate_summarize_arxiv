    "hardy s celebrated proof of nonlocality without inequalities for two - qubit systems caused much interest among physicists @xcite .",
    "hardy s proof has even been termed as  the best version of bell s theorem \" @xcite .",
    "soon after the publication of @xcite , pagonis and clifton @xcite extended hardy s nonlocality argument ( hna ) to @xmath1-qubit systems in a particular entangled state .",
    "moreover , wu and xie @xcite demonstrated hardy s nonlocality for almost all entangled states of three qubits by using a particular type of relationship among the coefficients of the given quantum state .",
    "subsequently , ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite dispensed with such a restriction and showed that hna runs for all genuinely entangled states of three qubits .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that for any maximally entangled state of three qubits the probability of success of hna can reach a maximum of 12.5% ( see also , in this respect , refs .",
    "@xcite where this result is reproduced for the specific case of three qubits in the maximally entangled ghz state ) . actually , as shown in @xcite , this maximum turns out to be optimal over all pure entangled states of three qubits subjected to local projective measurements .",
    "this result also holds for general ( dichotomic ) measurements on tripartite quantum systems of arbitrary dimension @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", cabello @xcite introduced a logical structure ( of which hardy s original formulation is a special case ) to prove bell s theorem without inequalities for three - qubit ghz and @xmath2 states .",
    "cabello s logical structure is as follows ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 in @xcite ) : consider four events @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , of which @xmath3 and @xmath5 may happen in one system , and @xmath4 and @xmath6 may happen in another ( spatially separated ) system .",
    "these events display the following features : ( i ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 sometimes happen , that is , the joint probability of occurrence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is nonzero ; ( ii ) @xmath3 always implies @xmath6 ; ( iii ) @xmath4 always implies @xmath5 ; ( iv ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 happen with lower probability than @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "taken together , features ( i)-(iv ) are incompatible with local realism . the argument for nonlocality based on this logical structure",
    "will be referred to as cabello s nonlocality argument ( cna ) .",
    "although cna was originally intended for three - qubit systems , liang and li @xcite developed a variant of it to show nonlocality without inequalities for a class of two - qubit mixed states , and kunkri and choudhary @xcite extended cna to two spin-@xmath7 systems along the procedure followed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , kunkri at al .",
    "@xcite showed that the maximum probability of success of cna for two - qubit systems in a pure entangled state is 0.1078 , whereas , as is well known , the highest probability of success of hna for two - qubit systems is @xmath8 @xcite .    in this paper , we study cna for three - qubit systems configured in the generalized ghz - like state : @xmath9 is an arbitrary orthonormal basis in the state space of qubit @xmath10 , @xmath11 . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath12 . note that @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) corresponds to the product ( maximally entangled ) state . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we show that cna runs for almost all entangles states of the form .",
    "more precisely , it is shown that cna does succeed for all the states for which @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an infinitesimal quantity .",
    "the maximum probability of success @xmath17 of cna for the class of states occurs at @xmath14 , with @xmath17 being equal to @xmath18 . in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we discuss cna for three - qubit systems in the framework of generalized no - signaling theory ( gnst ) , that is , a theory that allows arbitrary correlations between measurements on spatially separated systems as long as they are no - signaling @xcite .",
    "we find that the maximum success probability of both hna and cna within gnst reaches a value of @xmath19 , in agreement with the result found in @xcite concerning hna for three - qubit systems in the context of gnst .",
    "interestingly , this maximum value is the same as that attained for two - qubit systems under gnst @xcite .",
    "we also give an explicit example of postquantum no - signaling correlations for three - qubit systems that satisfy the modified hardy - type nonlocality conditions established in @xcite , and that violate maximally the _",
    "guess your neighbor s input _ ( gyni ) inequality @xcite .",
    "we conclude with summary and some remarks in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "let us consider a @xmath20 bell - type scenario in which three correlated qubits fly apart from a common source producing the triplet of qubits in the state .",
    "each of the qubits then enters its own measuring station where , for each run of the experiment , one of two alternative measurements is performed : @xmath21 or @xmath22 for qubit 1 , @xmath23 or @xmath24 for qubit 2 , and @xmath25 or @xmath26 for qubit 3 . each measurement gives the possible outcomes @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "the observables @xmath29 and @xmath30 have associated operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where the eigenvectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 are related to the original basis vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 by @xmath37 consider next the following set of equations : @xmath38 where , for example , @xmath39 denotes the joint probability that a measurement of @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath25 on qubits 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively , gives the outcome @xmath27 for each of them .",
    "- form the basis of cabello s nonlocality argument for three qubits . indeed",
    ", it is easily seen that these equations contradict local realism whenever @xmath40 .",
    "for this , note first that from eqs .",
    "- we can deduce the following three statements : ( 1 ) if @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath25 are measured , then necessarily @xmath41 if @xmath42 ; ( 2 ) if @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are measured , then necessarily @xmath43 if @xmath44 ; ( 3 ) if @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath26 are measured , then necessarily @xmath45 if @xmath46 .",
    "now , from eq .  , we get a fourth statement : ( 4 ) there is a nonzero probability @xmath47 of obtaining the results @xmath48 in a joint measurement of @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath25 .",
    "then , combining the above four statements with the assumption of local realism , one is led to conclude that the probability @xmath49 should be at least @xmath47 . but this contradicts eq .   if @xmath40 . the success probability for cna",
    "can therefore be quantified by the difference @xmath50 . in the particular case where @xmath51 the above ( cabello ) argument reduces to hardy s .    for the state , the quantum prediction for the joint probabilities and",
    "are given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , in order for the joint probabilities , , and to vanish , it is necessary that @xmath56 where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) . when the conditions in are met , the vanishing of the probabilities , , and is equivalent to the fulfillment of the conditions @xmath59 respectively",
    ". therefore , choosing @xmath60 , from eqs .",
    "it quickly follows that @xmath61 furthermore , from eqs . it can be deduced that @xmath62 where , without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath63 . thus , using relationships and in eq .  , and employing the shorthand notation @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , from eqs .",
    "and we finally obtain the success probability of cna as @xmath67 } { ( 1+t^2)(xyz + tx^2)(xyz + ty^2)(xyz + tz^2 ) }   \\notag \\\\ & - \\frac{1 + ( txyz)^2 - 2 t xyz \\cos\\gamma}{(1+t^2)(1+x^2)(1+y^2)(1+z^2)}.   \\label{cna}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a few comments are in order regarding the function @xmath68 in eq . .    1 .",
    "@xmath68 remains invariant under the permutations of the elements of the set @xmath69 .",
    "this means that in order for @xmath68 to attain an extremum value it is necessary that @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , it can be checked numerically that , for @xmath12 and @xmath71 , the global maximum of @xmath68 is obtained for @xmath14 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , and is given by @xmath74 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we have plotted @xmath75 as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "note that @xmath77 for @xmath78 , and thus , for @xmath72 and @xmath79 , cna does not work for @xmath76 ranging in the above interval .",
    "2 .   for @xmath13 , we have @xmath80 so that cna is not applicable for the product state irrespective of the values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 . due to continuity of @xmath68 , there is inevitably an interval @xmath83 for which @xmath84 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 can be made as small as desired by taking the product @xmath85 large enough .",
    "it should be noted , however , that , for large values of @xmath85 , @xmath68 is nonnegative only for a negligibly small interval of @xmath76 .",
    "a better option is to take the product @xmath86 large enough while keeping @xmath87 relatively small . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we have plotted @xmath88 as a function of @xmath76 . for this case , cna runs for all @xmath76 in the interval @xmath89 . as another example , let us mention that @xmath90 is positive for @xmath91 .",
    "the maximum obtained in this case is , however , not more than @xmath92 .",
    "3 .   for the special case",
    "in which @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we have @xmath95 and then cna reduces to hna . taking @xmath96",
    ", we obtain @xmath97 which attains a maximum value of @xmath98 for @xmath14 , in accordance with the results in @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that , out of the five probabilities appearing in eqs .",
    "- , one can derive the following bell - type inequality @xcite @xmath99 when the constraints in eqs .",
    "- are satisfied , inequality reduces to @xmath100 which is violated whenever @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , for the case in which @xmath102 , the maximum quantum violation @xmath103 of inequality is obtained for a state that is local - unitarily connected to the three - qubit ghz state @xcite .",
    "motivated by this fact , we conjecture that , for the case in which @xmath104 , the maximum quantum violation of inequality ( subject to the fulfillment of conditions - ) is achieved , over all possible states and choice of observables , for the ghz state @xmath105 , with the maximum violation being equal to @xmath106 .",
    "we now study the optimal success probability of cna for three - qubit systems within the framework of generalized no - signaling theory ( gnst ) @xcite .",
    "this is a minimally constrained theory for which , in addition to the consistency conditions of positivity and normalization of the probability distributions , we assume the no - signaling condition which forbids faster - than - light communication between distant observers .",
    "let us first recall that , for two - qubit systems , the success probability of both hna and cna can be increased up to @xmath19 within gnst @xcite . for two - qubit systems ,",
    "the cabello - type nonlocality conditions can be written as @xcite @xmath107 with @xmath108 . by using the above - mentioned conditions of normalization and no - signaling , and taking into account the constraints @xmath109",
    ", it is easily shown that @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the clauser - horne - shimony - holt sum of correlations @xcite , and where , for example , @xmath112 . since",
    ", by definition , @xmath113 can not exceed the algebraic limit of @xmath114 , it is concluded that @xmath115 can reach a maximum value of @xmath19 without violating the no - signaling constraint .",
    "furthermore , since a value of @xmath116 necessarily implies that @xmath117 and @xmath118 , this maximum is obtained for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "incidentally , we also note that , as is apparent from eq .  , the bell - chsh inequality , @xmath121 @xcite , is violated whenever @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the set of @xmath123 joint probabilities for three - qubit systems@xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 . in the framework of a general probabilistic theory , the allowed probability distributions @xmath127 are required to satisfy the following conditions @xcite :    * positivity : @xmath128 * normalization : @xmath129 * no - signaling : @xmath130    in addition to this , we impose the constraints in eqs .",
    "- , namely    * hardy / cabello nonlocality conditions : @xmath131 and @xmath132    our goal is to maximize the difference @xmath133 subject to the fulfillment of all the conditions in eqs . - .",
    "the software program mathematica gives us the result @xmath134 , along with the particular solution set @xmath135 with the remaining @xmath136 joint probabilities being all zero .",
    "the set of probabilities was already obtained by choudhary et al . in @xcite , where it is further noted that such solution is not unique .",
    "another set of probabilities yielding @xmath134 and which satisfies all the conditions in eqs .",
    "- is , for example , @xmath137 where only the nonzero probabilities have been written out .",
    "it is important to notice that the system of linear equations - is incompatible if we assume that @xmath47 and @xmath138 are of the form @xmath139 and @xmath140 , with @xmath141 .",
    "the maximum value @xmath142 allowed by gnst should therefore be realized for @xmath143 and @xmath102 .",
    "thus , regarding the maximum of @xmath5 , cna does not entail any advantage over hna in the context of gnst .",
    "this contrasts with the theory of quantum mechanics , which , as we have seen , predicts a maximum value of @xmath5 for cna which is greater than that predicted for hna .",
    "it is worth pointing out , on the other hand , that probability distributions like those in eqs . and satisfy any one of the svetlichny - type inequalities @xcite such as , for example , @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the expectation value of the product of the measurement outcomes of the observables @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "indeed , both probability distributions and pertain to the only class of extremal two - way local correlations that are not fully local @xcite , which means that such correlations can be accounted for by a hybrid hidden variables model in which arbitrary ( though no - signaling ) correlations may take place between two of the qubits , but only local correlations are present between these two qubits and the third one @xcite .",
    "specifically , for the probability distribution , it is readily seen that , when qubit 3 is ignored ( traced out ) , the correlations between qubits 1 and 2 are maximally nonlocal ( in fact , they make the parameter chsh as large as @xmath114 ) , while the correlations between the subsystem of qubits 1 and 2 , on the one hand , and qubit 3 , on the other hand , are strictly local .",
    "note , however , that both probability distributions and violate maximally the standard bell - type inequality when the conditions in eq .   are met .    the existence of multiple solutions to eqs .",
    "- yielding @xmath149 , stems from the fact that , for the case where @xmath150 and @xmath102 , the set of nonlocality conditions - ( along with the requirements of positivity , normalization , and no - signaling ) only determines five out of the eight correlations @xmath151 .",
    "this contrasts with the two - qubit case where the nonlocality conditions fix all four correlations @xmath152 so that the probability distribution for two - qubit systems yielding @xmath153 is ( for the said conditions ) unique .",
    "next we give the following probability distribution fulfilling all the conditions in eqs .  - , and for which @xmath154 ( with @xmath155 and @xmath102 ) : @xmath156 with the remaining @xmath157 joint probabilities being all zero .",
    "in addition to the nonlocality conditions - , the set of probabilities satisfies the modified hardy - type nonlocality conditions established in @xcite , which , for the specific case of three - qubit systems , read as @xmath158 where @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 denote marginal probabilities . the value @xmath154 is the maximum of @xmath5 achievable within gnst and which is consistent with the conditions in eqs .  .",
    "moreover , as shown in @xcite , only a unique pure genuinely entangled three - qubit state satisfies the above conditions .",
    "it is therefore concluded that , in contrast with the probability distributions and , the one in must violate some svetlichny - type inequality , namely @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "let us further observe that the set of probabilities violates maximally the gyni inequality @xcite @xmath164 indeed , as shown in @xcite , inequality is obeyed by quantum theory , while it is maximally violated by those postquantum no - signaling correlations for which each one of the four probabilities in is equal to @xmath165 .",
    "note , on the other hand , that the ( postquantum ) probability distributions and satisfy the above gyni inequality .    to end this section",
    ", we provide yet another probability distribution fulfilling all the conditions eqs .",
    "- , for which @xmath166 ( with @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) : @xmath169 with the remaining 46 joint probabilities being all zero .",
    "in this paper , we have fully characterized cabello s nonlocality for three qubits in the generalized ghz - like state . for this class of states the maximum success probability of cna",
    "is found to be @xmath170 , which is achieved for the maximally entangled ghz state ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we conjectured that the value @xmath170 is indeed optimal over all entangled states of three qubits subjected to arbitrary local projective measurements .",
    "moreover , we have shown that cna runs for almost all entangled states of the form .",
    "specifically , for all @xmath76 in the interval @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is an infinitesimal quantity ) , there exist observables @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath171 ) for which the conditions in eqs . - are satisfied , with @xmath172 .",
    "moreover , we have shown that , for three - qubit systems , the maximum success probability of both hna and cna can go up to @xmath19 within gnst . in this respect , we have pointed out that all the probability distributions giving @xmath173 under gnst satisfy @xmath174 and @xmath51 .",
    "we have also given an explicit ( postquantum ) probability distribution which violates maximally the gyni inequality , and which satisfies the stronger nonlocality conditions in eqs .",
    "( as compared to the weaker nonlocality conditions involved in either hna or cna ) .    on the other hand , it was shown in @xcite that for @xmath1-qubit systems ( @xmath175 ) in the generalized ghz - like state @xmath176 the maximum success probability @xmath177 of hna is obtained for @xmath178 , and is given by @xmath179.\\ ] ] from eq . , we can see that @xmath177 decreases exponentially with @xmath1 , and thus it seems not very promising to investigate cabello - type nonlocality for @xmath1-qubit systems with @xmath180 .",
    "regarding the ladder version of hna involving two - qubit systems and @xmath181 observables per qubit @xcite , it can be shown that , interestingly , the maximum success probability of cna ( call it @xmath182 ) for this scenario is strictly greater than that corresponding to hna ( call it @xmath183 ) for all @xmath184 @xcite .",
