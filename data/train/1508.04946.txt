    "series of papers studied the classification of the gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "they mainly agreed among these misterious phenomena not just short ( hard ) and long bursts exist but also a third type of grbs . in this paper",
    "we are going to summarize these analyses mainly done by the authors .",
    "the discovery of the third type of grbs goes back as early as 1998 @xcite .",
    "after that many research groups studied the batse bursts sample and concluded the third group of the grbs statistically exists @xcite .",
    "later several studies were published analysing different data sets .",
    "we are going to summarize some results according to the cgro , _ swift _ and beppo - sax satellites .",
    "the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) finished its mission in 2000 and the final batse catalog was published .",
    "the duration distribution of this sample can be well fitted with three gaussian .",
    "the significance that the third component is needed is 99.5% @xcite .",
    "several papers confirmed similar or even better significance @xcite .",
    "the first _ swift_-bat catalog @xcite was published in 2008 . in the catalog",
    "there are 237 grbs , of which 222 have duration information .",
    "the duration distribution of this sample can be seen in figure 1 . also a three gaussian fit is plotted in the figure .",
    "the significance of the third component is 99.4 % ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in the beppo - sax catalog @xcite there are 1082 grbs , of which 1003 have duration information ( see figure 2 . for the distribution ) . for the analysis of this distribution we used the maximum likelihood ( ml ) method .",
    "the ml method was not able to identify all the three subgroups in the beppo - sax data at a high significance level .",
    "however the third group in our analysis was the shortest in duration . therefore analyzing the duration distribution observed by beppo - sax grbm",
    "one can find the long and the intermediate duration population @xcite .",
    "the short population can be seen only with low significance level .",
    "this research is supported by hungarian otka grant k077795 , by otka / nkth a08 - 77719 and a08 - 77815 ( zb ) , and by a bolyai scholarship ( ih ) ."
