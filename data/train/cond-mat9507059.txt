    "coupled quantum wells fabricated by epitaxical growth make up interesting systems for studying electron ",
    "electron interactions in the low - dimensional systems both experimentally and theoretically . in coupled wells placed within tunneling distance , one",
    "can for instance study coulomb gaps in high magnetic fields.@xcite for wells separated so that tunneling can be disregarded , the effect of the mutual polarization may become important even at zero magnetic field , and it has been suggested that the interlayer correlations can drive a wigner crystallization@xcite when the coupled plasmon mode goes soft .",
    "this is however only relevant for low density systems and has so far not been observed experimentally . at higher densities , coupled collective modes in multilayer systems have been seen in inelastic light scattering experiments.@xcite in this paper , we discuss another probe of interlayer interactions and the possibility of observing the coupled plasmon modes in bilayer systems , namely by the so - called coulomb drag effect,@xcite where a current in one layer drives a current in the other layer due to the momentum loss caused by interlayer electron  electron scattering events .",
    "the coulomb drag effect has recently attracted much experimental @xcite and theoretical attention.@xcite    normally , the effects of electron  electron collisions only have indirect consequences for transport properties of single isolated quantum wells , because they conserve momentum .",
    "the coulomb drag effect is unique in that it provides an opportunity to directly measure electron ",
    "electron interaction through a transport measurement where momentum is transferred from one layer to the other . since interlayer interaction",
    "well depend strongly on the many - body effects of the system it is therefore essential to include screening in the theoretical understanding of the measurements.@xcite this has been realized in much of the theoretical work so far .",
    "recently , we have pointed out that at intermediate temperatures on the scale of the fermi temperature the drag effect should in fact be greatly enhanced by `` anti - screening '' due to coupled plasmon modes.@xcite    in this paper , we offer a more detailed study of the predicted plasmon enhancement effect in zero magnetic field .",
    "we base our calculation on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) which is generally believed to be valid for not too low densities such as e.g. the experimental realization fabricated by gramila _",
    "et al._@xcite however , for low density systems such as the electron - hole system studied by sivan _",
    "et al._,@xcite the rpa approximation is not able to account for the magnitude of the observed drag effect .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiment could be an indication of break - down of rpa due correlation effects.@xcite the sivan _",
    "et al . _ system is however not relevant for the plasmon enhancement effect studied here due to the large mismatch between the fermi velocities,@xcite as will be explained below .",
    "the results obtained in this paper are based on the boltzmann equation .",
    "quantum effects neglected by the boltzmann equation can be shown to be experimentally negligible in the structures we consider.@xcite we derive a generalized formula for the drag rate which is valid for arbitrary intralayer scattering processes , which reduces to the previously obtained results@xcite for the case of a constant relaxation time approximation .",
    "the role of intralayer carrier ",
    "carrier interactions has not been studied so far . as mentioned above the intralayer interactions usually only have indirect consequences for the transport properties .",
    "however , it turns out that the plasmon part of the drag effect is very sensitive to the details of the distribution function",
    ". we have solved for the distribution function including intralayer electron - electron interaction using parameters for gaas - algaas quantum wells and found that : ( 1 ) for high mobility samples where the distant to the @xmath3-doped impurities is fairly large the distrubution is well - described by a shifted fermi - dirac distribution function and which allows us to assume an energy independent momentum relaxation rate when calculating the drag rates .",
    "this is the situation previously studied by several authors.@xcite however , for the case where the dopants is moved closer to the two - dimensional electron gas the situation is changed and we predict and enhancement of the drag rate because of a larger plasmon contribution in this case .",
    "the reason for this enhancement is that distribution function becomes skewed toward higher energies and the overlap with the plasmon branch consequently becomes larger .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : dragrate ] we discuss the general formula for the drag rate , and in sec .  [ sec : rpa ] we study the rpa approximation of the screening for a coupled two - layer system .",

    "this sets up an induced electric field @xmath6 in layer two , where the current is set to zero .",

    "one can define a drag rate @xmath11 through @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the carrier density in layer 1 .",

    "the peaks are signatures of the plasmon enhancement effect , and they occur when the fermi _ velocities _ @xmath142 of both subsystems are equal.@xcite this is because the size of the plasmon contribution to @xmath116 is determined by the smaller of the im@xmath143 $ ] , which is roughly given by the distance between the particle - hole continuum and the plasmon dispersion line on the @xmath144 plane .",

    "thus far , we have assumed that the @xmath72 is constant ( which is equivalent to assuming that the distribution function is a shifted fermi - dirac function ) and hence eq .",
    "( [ dragrate ] ) is valid .",
    "this is only true if the sum of the impurity and phonon scattering rates is relatively energy independent and/or these rates are much smaller than the intralayer electron  electron scattering rates , as is the case when the dopants are placed approximately 700    away from the quantum well .",

    "this is because the charged impurity potential is long - ranged , implying that it falls off rapidly with increasing momentum transfer,@xcite and hence the momentum relaxation time increases with increasing momentum . at large @xmath151 , the electron",
    " electron scattering , which drives the distribution to a shifted fermi - dirac function , suppresses this positive slope .",
    "however , as the impurities are moved closer to the well , the impurity scattering and electron  electron scattering rates become comparable , and hence the positive slope in @xmath72 develops .",
    "a positive slope in @xmath72 enhances the drag rate because it implies that there are relatively more carriers at higher energies ( see eq .",

    "these higher energy carriers are able to carry more current , which consequently causes increase in the drag rate .",
    "the enhancement is even more pronounced when we include dynamical screening because it is the high - energy particles which participate in the plasmon - mediated interlayer coulomb interaction . in fig .",

    "the figure shows that one can obtain an enhancement in the drag rate of approximately a factor of 2 by moving the impurities to within 100    of the side of the well , all this coming from the momentum dependence of @xmath72 . from the figure",
    ", one can see the effect of the plasmons again on @xmath116 in the fact that the enhancement at small @xmath151 is largest at @xmath153k where the plasmon enhancement is the greatest , because a larger number of high - energy particles can now partake in the plasmon - enhanced interlayer scattering .",
    "finally , since we have studied the drag rate in the case where the absolute magnitude of the impurity scattering rate is large ( because @xmath151 is small ) one could ask if the diffusive form of the polarizability function@xcite at small @xmath99 and @xmath52 has any effect on our calculations at experimentally relevant temperatures .",
    "we conclude it does not because the crossover temperature is below which the diffusive effect should be seen goes as@xcite @xmath154 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath90 is on the order of 400   , and @xmath155 , the mean free path , is approximately 0.1 to 1 @xmath156 m for @xmath151 = 100 , the crossover temperature is extremely small and experimentally irrelevant .",
    "using the boltzmann equation , we have derived a formula for the transresistivity of coupled two - dimensional electron gases , valid for arbitrary intralayer scattering , to lowest nonvanishing order in the interlayer interaction . while the boltzmann equation does not include quantum effects such as weak - localization , it has been shown@xcite that these effects for systems where @xmath157 are negligible .",

    "the plasmons are  frozen out , \" and hence they play no role . at higher temperatures , however , the plasmons can enhance the drag rate by almost an order of magnitude over interactions which exclude dynamic effects of the coupled electron gas system .",
    "we have shown that the maximum plasmon enhancement occurs around 30 k for gaas when both wells are doped at 1.5@xmath159 . furthermore , because the plasmons enhancement is most effective when the fermi velocities of the two electron gases are equal , one should see a peak in the @xmath116 as the ratio of densities of the electron gases @xmath160 is varied through 1 .",
