    "the difference in @xmath13 spectra ( x=@xmath14 ) of leading and nonleading particles has been discussed recently and several theoretical models explained successfully the asymmetry as an effect of an interplay between the quark contents of the projectile and of the produced hadron .",
    "the charmed particles of leading type ( lp ) containing at least one ordinary quark of the same type as the beam particle have higher average @xmath13 value than the particles ( nlp ) of the same sort having no one quark in common with the projectile .    the asymmetry a(x ) is usually defined as : @xmath15 two experiments have measured recently the asymmetries between the spectra of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons as well as between @xmath0 and @xmath10 in @xmath11 interactions : wa89 @xcite ( cern ) at @xmath3= 340 gev / c and e781 @xcite(fnal ) at @xmath3= 600 gev / c .",
    "it seems to be interesting to consider these results from the point of view of quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) and to compare with @xmath16 asymmetry dependencies obtained in the @xmath9 experiments @xcitein order to understand the influence of quark composition of beam particle on the features of heavy flavored particle production .",
    "the nonperturbative approach accepted in our qgsm model @xcite exploits the properties of fragmentation functions in order to insert the asymmetry .",
    "the process of multiparticle production can be illustrated in qgsm with the cut n - pomeron diagram .",
    "the inclusive production cross section of hadrons h is written as a sum over n - pomeron cylinder diagrams : @xmath17 where function @xmath18 is a particle distribution in the configuration of n cut cylinders and @xmath19 is the probability of this process .",
    "the parameter of the supercritical pomeron used here is @xmath20 .",
    "the distribution functions are discribed in previous papers @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that a structure function of i - th quark wich has a fraction of energy @xmath21 in the interacting hadron,@xmath22 , and @xmath23 , a fragmentation function of this quark into the considered type of produced hadrons h , are constracted according to the regge asymptotic rules proposed in @xcite . in the case of hyperon beam",
    "they depend on the parameter of the regge trajectory of @xmath24-mesons ( @xmath25 ) because of s - quark contained in @xmath26 .",
    "the following favoured fragmentation function into @xmath27-mesons was written , for instance , for the strange valence quark fragmentation : @xmath28 where @xmath29=2@xmath30(0)@xmath31 .",
    "an additional factor @xmath32 provides the parametrization of the probability of heavy quark production in the interval z=0 to z @xmath33 1 .",
    "the function for the nonleading fragmentation of d - quark chain into @xmath34 has an additional @xmath35 according to the same rules : @xmath36 where @xmath37(0 ) .",
    "the dd - diquark fragmentation includes the constant @xmath38 which could be interpreted as `` leading '' parameter , but this value is fixed due to baryon number sum rule and should be approximately equal to @xmath38 taken for @xmath0 spectra in our previous calculations @xcite : @xmath39 where the term @xmath40 means the probability for initial diquark to have z close to 0 .",
    "some fractions of sea quark pairs in hyperon , @xmath41 and @xmath25 , are to be taken into account as far as they suppress the leading / nonleading asymmetry .",
    "the structure functions of ordinary quark pairs in the quark sea of hyperon can be written by the same way as the valence quark distributions .    as soon as we accounted @xmath41 and @xmath25 fraction in the quark sea of hyperon some fraction of charmed sea quark",
    "are to be considered as well .",
    "this small heavy quark admixture plays an important role due to its strong impact on the difference between leading and nonleading charmed meson spectra .",
    "the charmed sea quark structure function is similar to the distribution of strange sea quarks @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the weight of charm admixture in the quark sea of hyperon .",
    "in fact it is not necessarily to be equal to the charmed quark fraction in quark sea of pion @xcite .",
    "this is only one parameter we can vary for @xmath44 interaction after the best fit of pion experimental data which had been done before .",
    "the value of @xmath43 can be estimated in the description of the wa89 data on @xmath45- and @xmath46-meson asymmetries .",
    "fragmentation functions into @xmath46 mesons are the following : @xmath47",
    "the main parameter of qgsm scheme which is responsible for leading / nonleading charm asymmetry is @xmath8 , defined above .",
    "the fraction of charmed sea quarks , @xmath49 , is the second parameter in this calculations which makes the asymmetry lower because of the equal amounts of @xmath5 and @xmath4 mesons produced by each sea charmed quark pair .",
    "two sets of this couple of parameters were chosen in the description of @xmath9 reaction data : @xmath8=4 , @xmath50=0 and @xmath8= 10 , @xmath51 .",
    "we concider here these two values of @xmath8 taking the @xmath52 as more or less free parameter .",
    "the two curves provided the fits of e791 and wa92 pion beam experiment data @xciteare presented in fig.1 with two sets of parameters discussed above as well as the results of two other approaches @xcite .",
    "+    it should be mentioned that the smaller fraction of charmed sea quarks was taken into account ( @xmath53 for to describe both @xmath54 asymmetries in @xmath11 reaction instead of @xmath55 in the case of pion beam at the e791 experiment .",
    "the asymmetry between the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath10 measured in @xmath11 collisions can be easy obtained practically in the same calculations described here .",
    "what is important , the leading @xmath0 baryon is formated from single d - quark of projectile particle .",
    "no diquark from @xmath26 hyperon takes part in leading charm baryon production .",
    "it allows us to take the results of our calculation for d - meson production at @xmath3= 600 gev / c and to compare with the @xmath0/@xmath10 asymmetry measured in in @xmath11 collisions in the e781 experiment @xcite.the parameter @xmath8 means in this case a parametrization parameter for the density of uc - diquark in the string fragmentation , it can be different than @xmath8 taken for d - meson production .",
    "the energy of interaction has to be also changed .",
    "the parameter of the fraction of sea charm quarks , @xmath49 , must be of the same value as for d - meson calculations because it does nt know what leading particle is produced .",
    "the asymmetry between the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath10 measured in @xmath11 collisions at @xmath3= 600 gev / c is shown in fig.2 .",
    "+    the complete calculations carried out with the fragmentation function written for @xmath0 and @xmath10 production with proton beam give the good description of data with the value of diquark fragmentation parameter @xmath56 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "we can conclude here only that the data of the wa89 experiment on leading asymmetry in charmed meson production at @xmath11 interactions can be described within the framework of quark - gluon string model with the same asymmetry parameter @xmath57 as e791 data for @xmath9 reaction .",
    "good statistics on @xmath58 and @xmath59 production is needed to estimate the comparable influence of light , strange and charmed sea quark fractions for different beams . @xmath58 and",
    "@xmath59 asymmetries measured with @xmath26 beam are discribed with the different weight of charmed quark sea of interacting hyperon ( @xmath49=0.01 ) than it was done for @xmath60 beam interaction ( @xmath49=0.05 ) .",
    "@xmath61 asymmetry is higher than @xmath58 asymmetry because strange quark pairs suppressing the asymmetry at @xmath45 production have lower weight in quark sea of hyperon than ordinary @xmath41 pairs which cause the suppression of @xmath58 meson asymmetry .",
    "data of the e781 experiment on charmed baryon production asymmetry measured in @xmath11 collisions can be also described within the framework of quark - gluon string model with the asymmetry parameter @xmath62 for uc - diquark density in d - quark string fragmentation .",
    "the asymmetry between the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath10 does nt grow so rapidly with @xmath16 as it was predicted in other approaches .",
    "the rapid growing of asymmetry in the case of proton beam can be explained by the important role of ud - diquark fragmentation into @xmath0 .    99 wa89 collaboration , m.i.adamovich _ et.al._ , europian phys .",
