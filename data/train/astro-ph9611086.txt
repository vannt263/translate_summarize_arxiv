    "in this paper the structure of young globular clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is investigated with respect to theoretical models of globular cluster formation and evolution .",
    "observations are compared to @xmath0-body simulations of globular clusters including stellar evolution and the expulsion of residual gas not consumed in star formation .",
    "this allows some limits to be placed on the initial conditions which gave rise to these globular clusters .",
    "an important question in the theory of globular cluster formation and evolution is how similar are these young lmc objects to the precursors of the old globular clusters observed in the galaxy ?",
    "will these young globular clusters also be able to survive for a hubble time ?",
    "this paper examines the structure of the young globular clusters found in the lmc and tries to determine their initial conditions and , from the present theoretical understanding of globular clusters , if they will survive for a significant length of time in either the lmc or in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "globular clusters are usually extremely chemically homogeneous , compact star clusters containing some @xmath6 to @xmath7 of stars formed , presumably , in one burst of star formation . after this burst of star formation",
    "it is assumed that any significant amounts of residual gas remaining in the globular cluster are expelled .",
    "this prevents further star formation in a chemically enriched environment and retains the chemical homogeneity of the globular cluster ( lin & murray 1991 ) .",
    "the lmc provides the nearest example of the present day formation of globular cluster - type objects .",
    "these young lmc objects are variously refered to in the literature as young globular clusters , young populous clusters and blue globular clusters . for the purposes of this paper these objects",
    "will be refered to simply as young globular clusters .",
    "if these young globular clusters are , indeed , similar to those which gave rise to the ( old ) galactic globular cluster population then their study could provide important clues about the initial conditions and extent of the galactic globular clusters .",
    "the closeness of the lmc allows these objects to be studied in detail and their structural parameters to be determined with some accuracy .",
    "observations reveal a number of general characteristics of young globular clusters in the lmc :    1 .",
    "the density profiles in the inner regions of even very young clusters appear to be relaxed and well described by king ( 1966 ) models ( chrysovergis , kontizas & kontizas 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "2 .   spatial density profiles fall off in the outer regions of these clusters as a power law with index @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a fitting parameter used by elson , fall & freeman ( 1987 , hereafter eff ) defined in section 2.1 .",
    "clusters are often found to have large , unbound stellar halos which may contain up to 50% of the mass of the cluster ( eff , van den bergh 1991 ) .",
    "it is a young globular cluster with these characteristics that this paper attempts to model with @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "@xmath0-body simulations have been recently used to model globular clusters , fukushige & heggie ( 1995 ) used a @xmath0-body code to model globular clusters and compared these simulations to the fokker - planck calculations of chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) . in this case the results of both simulations were found to be qualitatively similar .",
    "such results show that the use of @xmath0-body codes for the modelling of systems as large as globular clusters is not without justification",
    ". however , as pointed out by heggie ( 1995 ) @xmath0-body simulations are only of use as statistical tests of a system s behaviour .",
    "for this reason , the evolution of any one cluster must be tested over a statistically significant number of simulations before any robust conclusions can be drawn about its behaviour .",
    "the effects of the expulsion of residual gas from an @xmath0-body system ( an open cluster ) were first studied by lada , margulis & dearborn ( 1984 ) who found that the expulsion of over 50% of the mass of a cluster may not entirely disrupt that cluster , but can leave a bound core of stars .",
    "the inclusion of residual gas and the effects of its expulsion in @xmath0-body simulations of globular clusters has been investigated in a paper by goodwin ( 1996 , hereafter paper i ) who finds that , while the expulsion of a large fraction of a globular clusters initial mass is disruptive to the cluster , many clusters may well be able to survive in the galaxy with star formation efficiencies ( sfes ) as low as 20% to 25% with sufficiently strict initial conditions .",
    "this paper assumes that the formation mechanism of globular clusters forms a smooth , relaxed initial stellar distribution similar to the observed distributions of young globular clusters only @xmath10 myr old ( elson , fall & freeman 1989 ; elson 1991 ) . in practice",
    "the distribution must be relaxed and smooth before the expulsion of the cluster s residual gas , not necesserally initially .",
    "it is assumed that any substructure and clumpiness present in the initial distribution does not significantly effect the dynamics and has been erased by this point .",
    "the survivability of these lmc clusters in the environment of our galaxy is assessed by comparing their postulated initial conditions with theoretical calculations of the initial conditions required in the galaxy .",
    "the theoretical constraints used are those from paper i based upon the king model based simulations of chernoff & shapiro ( 1987 ) .",
    "chernoff & shapiro presented calculations of the minimum king model required to survive for a hubble time in the galaxy for a variety of initial masses , initial mass function slopes and galactocentric radii .",
    "these results are found to be in reasonable agreement with both fokker - planck ( chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) and @xmath0-body ( fukushige & heggie 1995 ) calculations .",
    "these constraints were extended in paper i to include reasonable star formation rates and the expulsion of the residual gas which was not used in star formation .",
    "these results provided a minimum scale length of a plummer model required for survival for the range of initial conditions in chernoff & shapiro , star formation efficiency and the mechanism for gas expulsion .",
    "eight young lmc globular clusters with well - determined parameters and ages less than 100 myr have been chosen as indicative of the young clusters in the lmc .",
    "these clusters are ngc 1818 , ngc 2004 , ngc 2156 , ngc 2157 , ngc 2159 , ngc 2164 , ngc 2172 and ngc 2214 . their structural parameters and ages",
    "are summarised in table 1 .",
    "these clusters were all studied by eff and 6 of them by chrysovergis ( 1989 ) .",
    "eff also included ngcs 1831 and 1866 in their original sample .",
    "these clusters have not been included in the main analysis as they are both older than 100 myr .",
    ".structural parameters of the 8 young lmc globular clusters used as comparisons .",
    "( 1 ) mass . taken from chrysovergis ( 1989 ) , except ngc 2159 and ngc 2172 which are the mean of the values given by eff .",
    "( 2 ) central density . from eff .",
    "( 3 ) core radius . from elson , freeman & lauer ( 1989 ) .",
    "( 4 ) age .",
    "ngc 1818 average from will , bomans & de boer ( 1995 ) .",
    "ngcs 2004 , 2164 , 2214 from girardi ( 1995 ) .",
    "others in eff from hodge ( 1983 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this model provides an explanation for the differences observed in the quartet , in particular the coeval clusters ngc 2156 , 2159 and 2172 . these clusters , despite their striking similarities in age and location",
    "are very different in their profiles .",
    "they have the widest range of profile shape observed in the entire sample with @xmath9 = 2.75 , 2.15 and 3.20 respectively .",
    "if the sfe is the major factor in the determination of profile shape in these clusters then this discrepancy could be accounted for by varying the sfe between 25% and 60% in these clusters .",
    "the derived scale length for these clusters is @xmath11 pc .",
    "a constant scale length of 2.4 pc is possible within the errors quoted for @xmath9 . given this a common origin for these clusters would appear plausible .",
    "eff also determined profiles for 2 other young lmc globular clusters ngc 1831 and ngc 1866 .",
    "both of these clusters have not been included in the main analysis as they are older than 100 myr , ie .",
    "400 myr and 138 myr respectively ( girardi 1995 ) .",
    "ngc 1866 would not be expected to have had a strong tidal influence from the lmc , but ngc 1831 may have had some significant stripping of its tidal overflow modifying its profile .",
    "ngc 1866 fits well into the model of initial conditions , its profile being explicable with a scale length of @xmath12 pc and a 40% sfe .",
    "ngc 1831 is observed to have @xmath13 which would seem to imply a high sfe , however , the extent to which its profile would have been modified by the tidal field is difficult to quantify .",
    "the core radius of ngc 1831 is also large ( 3.3 pc ) but may have been substantially altered if the cluster had a low slope to its imf .",
    "if the conclusions drawn in the previous section are a fair representation of the initial conditions that have produced the young lmc globular clusters then it should be possible to say something about the survivability of those clusters .",
    "paper i presented results as to what initial conditions are necessary to produce a globular cluster that will survive for a hubble time in the galaxy . these conditions may be applied to the clusters in this sample to assess their survival chances .",
    "conditions within the lmc , especially with respect to the far weaker tidal field when compared to the galaxy , will mean that the survival conditions of paper i are an underestimate of the survivability of the young lmc globular clusters .",
    "however , it is of interest to examine whether these clusters would be able to survive within the galaxy to test if they are , indeed , representative of younger versions of the old galactic globular cluster population .",
    "interestingly , these clusters lie around the border - line of survival from paper i. a cluster with an initial mass of @xmath14 with a galactocentric distance of 5 to 8 kpc when @xmath4 is estimated to be able to survive if its initial plummer model length scale @xmath15 pc for supershell gas expulsion for an sfe of 50% . for an initial mass of @xmath16 this rises to @xmath17 pc . these values are somewhat lower than the scale lengths observed in the simulations which recreate the observed profiles .",
    "however , for galactocentric distances greater than @xmath18 kpc some of the clusters in this sample should be capable of surviving for a hubble time if @xmath19 .",
    "clusters with imf slopes of @xmath5 were not considered in paper i as chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) showed that clusters with reasonable initial conditions could not survive for a hubble time in the galaxy with such imf slopes .",
    "the range of scale lengths inferred for the initial plummer models of these globular clusters implies an initial central density within the proto - cluster clouds in the range @xmath20 to @xmath14 pc@xmath21 - similar in range to that observed in giant molecular clouds in the galaxy today ( harris & pudritz 1994 ) .",
    "this range is similar to that found as the border - line survival range for galactic globular clusters in paper i. this similarity with galactic giant molecular clouds is also independent of the imf slope .",
    "these values for the maximum scale length required for survival are also dependent upon the sfe of a cluster .",
    "the higher the sfe , the less disruptive is the gas expulsion mechanism , and the higher the maximum scale length required for survival . the clusters in the sample which require low sfes to produce the observed profiles",
    "would not be expected to be able to survive within the galaxy for a significant length of time . those clusters with high @xmath9 and so ,",
    "presumably , high sfes may be able to survive for a hubble time within the galaxy .",
    "considering the less disruptive nature of the environment around the lmc many of these sample clusters may be expected to survive for a significant length of time ( @xmath22 gyr ) .",
    "ngcs 2156 and 2164 in particular would appear to be strong candidates for clusters that could survive for a significant time even within the galactic environment if their imf slopes are sufficiently high .    at the other extreme",
    ", ngcs 1818 , 2159 and 2214 would almost certainly not be able to survive for any significant length of time in the galaxy , and maybe not for more than a few hundred myr even within the lmc .",
    "their low implied sfes and high core radii are indicative of weakly bound clusters .",
    "the slope of the imf significantly affects the structure and evolution of clusters .",
    "the discussion of the affect of the imf slope is included separately as it is the least well known of the structural parameters which will affect these clusters . as noted in section 2.3 values for the imf slope",
    "vary widely between clusters and the methods used to determine them , even within the same cluster .",
    "none of these methods are entirely reliable and selection of the correct value of the imf slope from the present literature appears impossible .",
    "for these reasons the effect of the imf slope is discussed for all apparently reasonable values .",
    "a note of caution should be added here about the slope of the imf .",
    "the long - term survivability of globular clusters is highly dependent upon this quantity ( chernoff & shapiro 1987 , chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) . if the young lmc globular clusters do , indeed , have as low a slope to their imfs as suggested by some studies ( see section 2.2 ) then the possibility of their surviving for any significant time , even in the lmc , would appear minimal .",
    "chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) find that for imf slopes lower than @xmath23 that a cluster can not survive for a hubble time with any reasonable initial conditions ( and certainly not for the initial conditions implied for these clusters in this paper ) .",
    "it seems highly improbable that the slope of the mass function could have been altered by dynamical processes far from the slope of the imf in such young clusters .",
    "multi - mass simulations including a tidal cut - off show a very minor change in the mass function after residual gas expulsion from the preferential escape of low mass particles ( @xmath24 drops to @xmath25 ) .",
    "it must be noted , however , that any mass effects would be considerably dampened by the significant softening used in the simulations .",
    "this paper presented the results of a comparison of observations of young ( @xmath26myr ) large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) globular clusters with @xmath0-body simulations of globular clusters .",
    "the @xmath0-body simulations were based on aarseth s ( 1996 ) nbody2 code . stellar evolutionary mass loss and a variable external potential used to simulate the expulsion of residual gas ( that gas not used to form stars in the initial burst of star formation in the globular cluster )",
    "were included in the code .",
    "the aim of the paper was to explore the initial conditions which gave rise to these young globular clusters .",
    "the initial conditions of particular interest were the initial spatial and energy distributions of the stars and the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) of the proto - cluster . the initial mass function ( imf ) slope was varied between 2.35 ( the salpeter value ) and 1.50 , covering the mid to upper end of observed values .",
    "the simulations were compared primarily with the observations of 8 young lmc globular clusters made by elson , fall & freeman ( 1987 , eff ) .",
    "eff found best fit luminosity profiles for these clusters and deprojected these to give density profiles .",
    "these density profiles were integrated to obtain the mass distribution .",
    "the observed and simulated mass distributions were compared to find which initial conditions gave a good representation of the observations .    a simple statistical analysis of the observations from eff shows that there is apparently no correlation between profile shape and any other measured parameter of the cluster .",
    "it is suggested that the prime mechanism for setting the profiles of these young globular clusters is the value of the sfe and the residual gas expulsion whose disruptive effect depends upon it .",
    "it is suggested that the variety of young globular clusters observed in the lmc could be produced from a fairly uniform population of proto - cluster clouds which form stars in a relaxed distribution ( similar to a plummer model with length scale @xmath2pc@xmath3 ) and sfes from 25% to 60% where the residual gas was expelled by a supershell caused by the supernovae of the most massive stars in the cluster .",
    "these scale lengths correspond to central densities similar to those found in giant molecular clouds in the galaxy ( harris & pudritz 1994 ) .",
    "the present understanding of star formation , especially in dense environments such as those presumably present in proto - cluster clouds , is not good enough to answer the question as to why sfes should vary so much between different globular clusters ( if , indeed , it does ) .",
    "the presence and strength of magnetic fields within the proto - cluster cloud may have a significant effect upon the sfe .",
    "the rotation of a proto - cluster cloud could , also , produce an effect upon the sfe .",
    "the most uncertain assumption made is that the initial distribution of the clusters is similar to a plummer model .",
    "this assumption is made partly on the basis of simplicity ( and the ability to use a simplification of the complex hydrodynamics of gas expulsion ) and partly on observations of ngc 2070 ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "kennicutt & chu ( 1988 ) question the physical significance of the good fit given by star counts in ngc 2070 to an isothermal profile as stars still appear to be forming in ngc 2070 and most of the stars to which they fit their profile will , they suggest , disappear over a few 10s of myr . as kennicutt & chu s survey only includes stars with @xmath27 this would appear to be so .",
    "however , it seems reasonable to assume ( in the absence of evidence to the contrary ) that these stars would trace the underlying low mass stellar distribution . in this case",
    "the use of a plummer model would seem not to be too unreasonable a first approximation , especially if the high mass stars are clumped more than the low mass stars ( ie .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is not constant ) .",
    "the stellar population may not be virialised , and the effect that this may have was discussed in section 4.1 .",
    "these simulations also assumed that the velocity distribution is isotropic , which may well not be the case .",
    "these clusters are probably rotating and may have other ordered internal motions .",
    "what effects these may have is difficult to estimate but they are assumed to be minimal , especially when compared to the effects of the residual gas expulsion phase .    whatever the initial stellar distribution function it is possible to say that in a very short period of time ( @xmath28 myr ) these young globular clusters are well described by king models in their central regions ( chrysovergis 1989 ) which would suggest that , by this time they are relaxed .",
    "a paper is in preparation in which the effects of a clumpy initial distribution are investigated .",
    "results appear to show that violent relaxation is able to erase substructure very rapidly , however , the profiles of very clumpy initial distributions are not compatible with observation .",
    "the result that the three coeval clusters ( ngc 2156 , 2159 and 2172 ) within the quartet have profiles consistent with very similar initial proto - cluster conditions , but different sfes is interesting .",
    "these initial conditions are also consistent with those derived for the quartet s fourth member ngc 2164 .",
    "interestingly the age difference between ngc 2164 ( @xmath29 myr ) and the quartet s other members ( @xmath30 myr ) may suggest that the formation of the other three clusters may have been triggered by the residual gas expulsion from ngc 2164 .",
    "this is a similar scenario to that envisioned for the young lmc double globular cluster ngc 1850 ( gilmozzi 1994 ) .",
    "if , as appears possible , these young lmc clusters are analogues to the young galactic population in the epoch of globular cluster formation ( 10 to 15 gyr ago ) they may provide information on that population . as only 2 or 3 of the clusters in this sample are good candidates for survival in the galaxy , this",
    "may imply that the initial galactic population was far larger than that observed today .",
    "however , a full analysis of the possible survivability is dependent upon the slopes of the imfs , which are poorly known , as well as upon full simulations of globular cluster evolution .",
    "the conclusions of this paper may be briefly summarised as :    1 .",
    "the variety of young globular clusters in the lmc can be explained if they all formed in large proto - cluster clouds with a distribution similar to a plummer model with a scale length of 1 to 3 pc ( the majority with a scale length of around 2 pc ) .",
    "the effects of residual gas expulsion would explain the differences in profiles between clusters if their star formation efficiencies varied between 25% and 60% .",
    "2 .   the three coeval clusters from the quartet ( ngcs 2156 , 2159 and 2172 ) have profiles consistent with very similar initial conditions with @xmath31 pc if their star formation efficiencies were @xmath32 40% , 25% and 60% respectively .",
    "their age ( 65 myr ) is also consistent with their star formation being triggered by the expulsion of residual gas from the quartet s fourth member ngc 2164 ( @xmath33 myr ) .",
    "3 .   if these clusters have an initial mass function slope similar to the salpeter value ( 2.35 ) then 3 of these clusters ( ngcs 1818 , 2159 and 2214 ) would appear to be good candidates for globular clusters that may be able to survive for a hubble time within the galaxy . within the lmc ,",
    "ngcs 2156 and 2172 may also be able to survive for a hubble time .",
    "if the initial mass function slope of these clusters is much lower than 2.35 then none of these clusters would be expected to survive for a significant time in the galaxy .",
    "even survival for more than a few gyr within the lmc would seem unlikely due to the large amounts of mass loss from stellar evolution .",
    "5 .   if these clusters do represent a young analogue to the galactic globular clusters then the initial number of globular clusters in our galaxy would have been far higher than is observed today .",
    "the disruption of clusters from evaporation considered in this paper would be heightened by other processes such as bulge and disc shocking .",
    "the present globular cluster population of the galaxy may only represent a small proportion of the original population .",
    "thanks go to my supervisor r.j.tayler , s.j.aarseth for allowing me use of his nbody2 code and his useful comments as referee for this paper , d.c.heggie for help with the computational side and r.a.w.elson for discussions about the observations .",
