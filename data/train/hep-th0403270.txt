    "de sitter or quasi - de sitter 4d geometries describe the present day acceleration of the universe as well as the inflationary expansion at very early times .",
    "this stimulates significant interest towards the construction of 4 dimensional ds geometry in the context of fundamental string / m theory , which are formulated in 10/11 dimension , with a compact internal space @xcite .",
    "similarly , compactification to 4d ds geometry takes place in phenomenological braneworld models , where the inner space is periodic with orbifold branes at the edges @xcite .",
    "although most of the activity in this area has been enhanced by very recent progress ( both on the observational and theoretical side ) the issue of dimensional reduction to the outer cosmological space ",
    "time was popular since the 1980s , either in high dimensional supergravity theories or on phenomenological grounds .",
    "for example , see the collection of references on kk cosmology given in @xcite .",
    "the geometries we discuss here have @xmath3 spatial dimensions wrapped on a compact manifold @xmath4 , in addition to the standard @xmath5 space  time .",
    "many of the mentioned examples are covered by the @xmath0 dimensional geometry with the metric @xmath6 where the outer space is a ds 4d metric with a hubble parameter @xmath7 , while @xmath8 is the metric of the compact inner space with @xmath3 coordinates @xmath9 . for generality",
    ", we also include the warp factor @xmath10 . in the following we use greek letters to describe the @xmath5 outer space ",

    "capitalized roman letters span all coordinates . with the re - definition of the inner space metric @xmath12 and the warp factor @xmath13",
    ", we can re - write ( [ blocks ] ) in a conformally - factorized form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is de sitter metric .",
    "this form of the metric is more convenient for developing the formalism of metric perturbations around a warped @xmath16 background , which we will present below .",
    "> from the string theory / supergravity perspective , recent studies have concentrated on the compatibility of high @xmath0 dimensional geometries ( @xmath17 ) with a 4d de sitter geometry as the outer space  time , and on the stabilization of the internal space to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the bulk geometry , which is usually treated in the supergravity limit , requires a careful study of the @xmath0 dimensional ( bulk ) einstein equations .",
    "the progress in finding solutions is related to the identification of various possible sources for the bulk stress energy tensor @xmath19 , including supergravity lagrangian fields , branes with fluxes , etc . in phenomenological braneworld models , the @xmath20 or @xmath21 dimensional bulk geometry",
    "is stabilized , for instance , by means of bulk scalar fields as in the goldberger - wise model  @xcite , or more generally through the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "very often , however , the stabilization is studied at the level of a 4 dimensional effective theory , where the inner space geometry emerges in terms of moduli fields .",
    "if the effective potential of the moduli has a minimum , the moduli are considered to be stabilized .",
    "an example will be the stabilization mechanism with quantum field theory effects which emerge from the properties of @xmath4 , e.g. the casimir effect from compact inner dimensions .",
    "it is a reasonable assumption that in principle there shall be a bulk prototype @xmath22 ( may be as a complicated functional of the metric and the topology ) which generates corresponding terms of the 4d effective potential .",
    "the version of string theory dimensional reduction of  @xcite is realized with the participation of the instanton effects ( which are manifested in 4dim superpotential of @xmath23 supergravity ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether it is possible to think about a bulk prototype @xmath19 of these effects .    while it is reasonable to assume that the low energy 4d effective action is einstein gravity plus moduli fields ( or brans - dike gravity plus moduli ) , this picture lacks the full higher dimensional solution of the einstein equations with proper sources . in particular , the four dimensional description is inadequate for studying the high energy regime ( high ds curvature ) where the stabilization can break down . for example , in the 5 dimensional braneworld models , the issue of stabilization due to the bulk scalar field can be formulated fully in terms of the stability of the 5 dimensional warped geometry against scalar metric perturbations . from this study",
    "one can determine the modes which enter in the exact low energy 4 dimensional description , namely the radion and the other kk modes of the system @xcite , which can not be found from an heuristic 4 dimensional effective potential .",
    "we are not concerned here with the details of the stabilization mechanism .",
    "our main goal is to determine the effects of the ds expansion on the stability of these geometries .",
    "as we will show , compactifications to a 4dim ds space  time are more difficult to achieve than compactification to a 4dim flat space  time .",
    "this is due to a tachyonic contribution to the square of the mass of scalar metric perturbations arising from the de sitter curvature . in what follows",
    "we will discuss the properties of @xmath0 dimensional classical einstein equations assuming a bulk @xmath19 as a source , but without specifying it .",
    "the gravitational instability which we will discuss comes from the gravity sector , so that the exact form of @xmath19 will not be crucial .",
    "of course it will be attractive to check how the effect works for each particular model of @xmath19 .",
    "however , we will try to argue that the instability effect is generic .",
    "previous studies of the gravitational sector ( _ i.e. _ metric perturbations ) of the compactification concentrated on the dimensional reduction to 4dim flat space ",
    "time @xcite .",
    "the instability effect which we find emerges when the outer space is curved instead of flat , and it is proportional to the curvature .",
    "notice that test scalar fields propagating in @xmath24 do not exhibit tachyonic masses under kk projection  @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a significant difference in the mass spectrum between the test fields and the self - consistent treatment of the metric fluctuations around this background .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : metric ]",
    "we introduce a generic formalism of metric fluctuations around the @xmath25 background and define scalar , vector and tensor fluctuations acording to their transformation properties relative to @xmath1 . in section",
    "[ sec : lin ] we introduce the linearized equations that govern the evolution of scalar perturbations of the metric and show how the tachyonic instability of the scalar modes arises from the gravitational sector . in sections",
    "[ sec : ex1 ] and  [ sec : ex2 ] we show two explicit example where the instability is manifested . in section  [ sec : mod ] we discuss how the instability may be relevant for the generation of the primordial perturbations , providing a very natural and model - independent realization of the idea of modulated perturbations  @xcite . conclusions and a brief discussion can be found in section  [ sec : end ] .",
    "the setting of the problem we are discussing is similar to the routine setup for @xmath5 dimensional cosmology with the metric @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the metric of 3d space of constant curvature .",
    "perturbations of this metric can be classified in terms of freely propagating gravitational waves , together with vector and scalar perturbations , supported by the perturbations of the sources ( for instance scalar field fluctuations @xmath28 in the scalar field cosmology ) .",
    "the classification of cosmological fluctuations is based on the gauge - invariant bardeen s variables @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in the background geometry ( [ conf ] ) there are also different modes of metric perturbations , corresponding to different irreducible representations of the background symmetries .",
    "modes living in different representations are not coupled at the linear level .",
    "for this reason , it is very useful to extend the classification of  @xcite to this case too .",
    "bearing in mind the similarities in the structures of our bulk metric ( [ conf ] ) and the @xmath5 cosmological metric , the generalized perturbed form of the metric ( [ conf ] ) can be written as    @xmath29dx^\\mu dx^\\nu - 2a_{a\\mu}dy^adx^\\mu\\right\\}\\ ] ]    with @xmath30 and where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are divergence free and @xmath32 is traceless . the cross component @xmath33 can be further decomposed into individual scalar and vector contributions as @xmath34 .",
    "it is simple to check that the variables @xmath35 account for all possible physical metric perturbations .",
    "gauge invariant variables that are counterparts to the bardeen variables in @xmath5 dimensions can be derived in this setup by considering infinitesimal coordinate transformations @xmath36 . in particular",
    "we have new scalar variables @xmath37    in terms of _ four _ dimensional tensor properties in the 4d observable world , we distinguish scalar perturbations @xmath38 , vector perturbations @xmath39 and tensor perturbations @xmath40 .    this is a rather important and subtle point .",
    "what is a scalar fluctuation with respect to 4 dimensional de sitter space  time , may have a non  scalar nature in the bulk geometry .",
    "for instance , a free graviton in the bulk may have a gravi ",
    "scalar projection in the 4d space  time . below",
    "we will construct a specific example where the scalar metric perturbation of ( [ form ] ) in fact comes from free bulk graviton .",
    "our grouping of the metric perturbations ( [ form ] ) is very similar to the metric fluctuations formalism of @xcite designed for higher dimensional braneworlds .",
    "the important distinction between our formalism and that of @xcite are the following : we keep the time coordinate in the homogeneous part of the de sitter metric , and the tensorial properties of fluctuations are related to the 4 dimensional symmetric part . in @xcite the tensorial properties",
    "are related to the 3 dimensional homogeneous space .",
    "in addition ; we do not rely in any way on the existence of branes in the models . on the other hand",
    ", our formalism can embrace the braneworld inflation as a particular case .",
    "as mentioned , the main advantage of using the split ( [ form ] ) is that perturbations of different types are not coupled at the linear level .",
    "the analysis is further simplified if the same decomposition is performed also for the perturbations of the source term @xmath41 . in this work",
    "we study metric perturbations of the scalar type . in this work ,",
    "in passing we can make the following remark : it is known that tensor modes on the ds background have the zero kk mode followed by a gap of amplitude @xmath42 due to the unitary constraint @xcite . also , notice that @xmath32 does not describe all the projections of the bulk graviton . ]      for this case we can define a generalized longitudinal gauge analogous to the @xmath5 dimensional case . in this gauge",
    "the scalars @xmath43 and @xmath44 vanish , and the scalar perturbations @xmath45 and @xmath46 coincide with the gauge invariant variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "thus , without lost of generality , the ` scalar ' part of metric fluctuations around a geometry with @xmath16 symmetry can be simply written as @xmath49    we can obtain a further reduction in the degrees of freedom where the internal space @xmath50 is maximally symmetric . in this case @xmath51 , and we obtain @xmath52 \\,\\ , .",

    "it is characteristic of a strong gravity regime , where the presence of any source ( the cosmological constant , in the case at hand ) can be neglected .",
    "in the previous sections we discussed how the de sitter expansion can affect the stability of the internal space . as we discussed , the stability can not be reached by gravity alone .",
    "a point of phenomenological relevance is that the field(s ) responsible for the stabilization unavoidably introduce ( quantum ) fluctuations which perturb the background geometry . even if these fluctuations are heavy today , so that they have not been yet observed at accelerators , they could have had a mass smaller than the expansion parameter @xmath7 during inflation .",
    "this is particularly true if the the expansionary rate itself gives a negative contribution to their masses , as we discussed above .",
    "if this is the case , the fluctuations are amplified to a classical level during the inflationary expansion .",
    "these fluctuations can arise independently on slow roll inflaton field .",
    "they can be generated even in absence of an inflaton field ( if , for example , inflation is due to some metastable form of vacuum energy ) since they are `` supported '' by the bulk dynamical fields responsible for the stabilization of @xmath4 .",
    "as we will see fluctuations of the internal manifold will lead to modulated perturbations .",
    "the modulated fluctuations were introduced recently as an alternative mechanism of generation of pimordial cosmological perturbations @xcite .    to see this ,",
    "let us focus on the four dimensional part of the geometry",

    "more generally , we can also obtain it starting from the geometry([line ] ) and integrating over @xmath50 ( in which case @xmath140 and @xmath48 do not depend on @xmath121 ) .",

    "however , the choice  ( [ action ] ) is adequate enough for the following discussion .",
    "the action  ( [ action ] ) differs from a standard theory of inflation due to the presenc of interaction term @xmath224 .",
    "perturbations of @xmath48 lead to rescaling of masses and couplings during inflation , untill the moduli @xmath48 is pinned down to its minimum where it has the the mass @xmath152 .",
    "the spatial fluctuations @xmath225 of the geometry introduce a small spatial dependency in this redefinition , so that any physical mass scale and couplings will be slightly different in different parts of the universe .",
    "inhomogeneities of the moduli field @xmath48 are generated during inflation if its mass @xmath226 is ligther than the hubble parameter .",
    "now we recall the results of the previous section , that @xmath152 contains tachyonic contribution .",
    "therefore , an interesting possibilitu arises if the net value of @xmath152 is smaller than @xmath227 . in this case during inflation we encounter generation of spatial fluctuations of @xmath48 . in the late universe",
    "long after inflation , when @xmath7 significantly drops , we expect @xmath152 be positive and large relatively to the temperature of the universe , si that @xmath48 is stabilized .    small spatial variation of masses and coupingsm immediately after inflation , during ( p)preheating after inflation , will result in a spatial dependency of the inflaton decay rate @xmath228 @xmath229 this fluctuation in the decay of the inflaton give rise to the adiabatic mode of the ( standard ) perturbations : after the reheating epoch the evolution of the perturbations in the various decay products follows the standard picture .",
    "the important distinction is that in this case the inflaton assumes a secondary role in defining the nature of the perturbations .    after reheating ends and modilu @xmath57",
    "is trapped in its minimum , spatial variatins of masses and couplings are erased .",
    "however , long wavelength metric perturbations generated during the inflaton decays are preserved as the scalar cosmological perturbations @xcite",
    ".    there has been some activity in the computation of the spectrum of cmb anisotropies in braneworld models .",
    "however , many of these studies do not discuss the general set of metric perturbations in the bulk , but rather focus on the evolution of the standard four dimensional perturbations with the braneworld configuration as a background . on the contrary ,",
    "the mechanism outlined here exploits the presence of new perturbations , related to the bulk dynamic , in a crucial way ( notice that the conformal mode  ( [ action ] ) is absent on the standard @xmath82 dimensional case ) .",
    "in addition , the one we have described is a very natural realization of the general idea of modulated perturbations proposed in  @xcite , since we provide a definite candidate ( generally present in all the configurations  ( [ blocks ] ) for the modulus field controlling @xmath230 ) .",
    "there has been much focus recently on so  called `` anomalies '' emerging in the observations of lss and the cmb  @xcite ranging from an intriguing lack of power on the largest scales  @xcite , the possibility of `` glitches '' in the cmb spectrum and an indication of running of the spectral index of the primordial scalar perturbations ( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) , to detections of mild non - gaussianity and indications of a finite topology for the @xmath231 spatial dimensions .",
    "the accuracy of future observations is expected to increase greatly over the next decade and the hope is that if any of the anomalies turn out to be robust results they will help to constrain new physics modifying the dynamics in the early universe .",
    "[ sec : end ]    a typical denominator in many extensions of the standard model is the presece of extra - dimensions . in the simplest possibilities ,",
    "the extra space is a compact and static manifold @xmath4 .",
    "a stabilization mechanism is typically required to explain why @xmath50 should remain static , while the @xmath231 noncompact spatial dimensions are undergoing cosmological expansion . in particular , significant activity has been recently made trying to reconcile this picture with a de sitter ( or quasi de sitter ) geometry for the noncompact coordinates .",
    "indeed , observations are telling us that the expansion of the universe was accelerating at very early times , and it is accelerating also at present .    the present note is focused on the effects of the inflationary expanison on the stability of @xmath4 .",
    "we have argued that the ds curvature ( in other words , a nonvanishing expansion rate @xmath7 ) has typically the effect to destabilize the internal space , and that any given stabilization mechanism can be effective only up to a certain curvature .",
    "we have aimed to discuss this effect in the most general way possible , enlighting the consequences of making the only assumption that the geometry is of the @xmath232 type , with an arbitrary compact space of @xmath3 dimsensions , and possibly with the presence of a warp factor .",
    "such a set - up is also relevant for string - theory , in the supergravity limit .    to discuss the stability of the system ,",
    "we have studied the most general set of perturbations of the @xmath233 geometry .",
    "it is very convenient to classify the perturbations into irreducible representations of the @xmath1 symmetry group .",
    "the big advantage of doing so , is that modes belonging to different representations are not coupled at the linear level .",
    "the perturbations can be devided into scalar , vecor , or tensor modes with respect to the @xmath1 isometries . after a general classification ,",
    "we have focused on the scalar modes , since they are ususally the most relevant one for inflationary geometries , and since they encode the effects of the instability we want to discuss .",
    "the linearized einstein equations for the perturbations show that the physical mass squares @xmath234 of these modes acquire a negative contribution due to the @xmath235 expansion , @xmath236 this is true for arbitrary @xmath4 , @xmath165 , and for any possible underlying stabilization mechanism .",
    "the presence of this tern is a signal for a possible gravitational instability of the system . indeed ,",
    "if the whole @xmath85 turns out to be tachyonic , the @xmath237 is unstable .",
    "clearly , verifying whether ( and at which @xmath7 ) the instability takes place is very model dependent issue which should be verified case by case ( namely , for any given source @xmath238 ) . indeed ,",
    "other contributions to @xmath234 also dpend on @xmath7 ( although in most cases only indirectly , due to the fact that these terms depend on other background quantities , and that these quantities are related to @xmath7 through the background einstein equations ) . however , the contribution  ( [ tacconc ] ) is _ generally _ present , and it has to be taken always into account .",
    "moreover , the study of several different examples , as well as general arguments , lead us to conjecture that the term  ( [ tacconc ] ) is the dominant one at large @xmath151 , and that no stabilization mechanism can be effective up to arbitrarly large ds curvature .    in this work",
    ", we have presented explicit and exact calculations in two specific examples .",
    "the first of them is codimension one braneworld configurations with bulk scalar field(s ) .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , in this case it is possible to derive an explicit upper bound @xmath239 ( where @xmath140 is the warp factor , see eq .",
    "( [ mass3 ] ) ) for the mass of the lightest eigenmode .",
    "this bound allows to determine at which @xmath7 the system becomes unstable .",
    "the second example is when @xmath50 is a @xmath160sphere , and when the only source term isw a cosmological constant .",
    "this system is well known to be unstable , and we have shown that the instability is precisely due to the tachyonic nature of the scalar modes which we have identified in the general calculation .",
    "there are also general arguments in support of the instability at high @xmath151 .",
    "the first is related to causality . if , as in the standard @xmath82 dimensional case , the hubble length @xmath240 has the meaning of a casual horizon , we should expect that any stabilization mechanism can not be at work when @xmath7 becomes much greater than the inverse size of @xmath50 ( since different `` edges '' of @xmath50 would then be casually disconnected ) .",
    "such a behavior can be found in  @xcite , where the cosmology of the randall - sundrum model  @xcite was studied under the assumption of radion stabilization .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that radion stabilization can not be imposed if the physical energy on the hidden brane is greater than @xmath241 .",
    "the appearence of this intermediate scale is somewhat surprising , and indeed it was left unexplained in  @xcite .",
    "however , it can be verified that it is precisely at this energy density that @xmath240 becomes smaller than the distance between the two branes .",
    "a second argument can be inferred from the @xmath159 example .",
    "we noted that the instability has two possible end - points .",
    "one is characterized by a shrinking internal space , with asymptotic kasner solution ( a similar behavior was already noted in  ( @xcite ) in the case of brane collisions ) .",
    "the second one is instead exact @xmath242 , with all the compact and noncompact dimensions expanding with the same asymprtotic rate .",
    "this suggests that the instability can be attributed to the tendency of an inflationary expansion to homogenize and isotropize the _ whole _ geometry , in this case by `` dragging '' also the compact space into a de  sitter solution .",
    "this behavios , which is a well known feature of inflationary expansions , is encountered also in many bianchi models .    in the final part of the work ,",
    "we have also commented on the possible role of the instability in the generation of primordial perturbations .",
    "the scalar perturbations appear as a conformal mode from the four dimensional point of view ( for example , for an observer living on a @xmath231-brane , or after integrating out the internal space @xmath4 ) .",
    "this mode is a clear signature of the extra dimesnions , since it is absent in the standard @xmath82 dimensional case .",
    "if , due to the tachyonic contribution , this mode light ( @xmath243 ) during the de sitter stage , it will be amplified with a scale invariant spectrum and with an amplitude which is disentangled from the standard result of slow - roll inflation .",
    "one can think of a number of ways how the conformal perturbation could be responsible for the adiabatic mode in the later frw evolution .",
    "for instance , consider a mixture of fields conformally and nonconformally coupled to the noncompact geometry .",
    "only the nonconformally coupled fields will be sensitive to the conformal perturbations , so that we expect that the final mode perturbation will be proportional to the amount of these fields in the mixture . in the text we have instead focused on a much simpler possibility , related to the mechanism of modulated perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the conformal factor can be usually rescaled away by a rescaling of the energy scales in the @xmath82 dimensional theory ( this is exactly what occurs in the randall - sundrum model  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , its fluctuations can be interpreted as fluctuations masses of particles and rates of processes in the @xmath82 dimensional theory . in oarticular",
    ", this may be the origin of the fluctuations of the decay rate of the inflaton , which is at the basis of the mechanism of modulated perturbations .",
