    "the structure of the outer parts of galactic disks is central to our understanding the formation and evolution of spiral galaxies .",
    "the surface brightness profile of a spiral galaxy is a first order signature of the formation process ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ; van der kruit 1987 ; ferguson & clarke 2001 ) . by measuring scale lengths for galaxy samples of different redshifts ,",
    "it is for example possible to directly address the evolution of galactic disks ( labb2003 ) .    to a first approximation ,",
    "the radial light distribution of disks is well described by an exponential decline ( freeman 1970 ) . if the exponential is due to dynamical evolution ( lin & pringle 1987 ) , it is important to establish out to what radius this process took place .",
    "it is possible that departures from an exponential will show up at faint levels , reflecting new forms of dynamical evolution or different angular momentum of the outermost accreted material .",
    "previous studies have shown that the exponential light distribution breaks smoothly at a well - defined ` break radius ' in some galaxies ( pohlen et al .",
    "2002 ; de grijs et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the optical",
    ", this occurs at galactocentric distances of typically 3 - 5 exponential scale lengths . in principle",
    ", this break radius could be used as an intrinsic parameter measuring the size of a galactic disk . however , despite the fact that these breaks have been known for more than 20 years ( van der kruit 1979 ) , we do not have a secure understanding for the origin of the break , so their application as a fundamental disk characteristic is therefore not yet possible .    beyond the break radius ,",
    "stars are detected albeit with a steeply declining luminosity profile (  kregel , van der kruit & de grijs 2002 ) .",
    "to date , the outer edge of the stellar disk ( ` truncation radius ' ) has not been detected in any galaxy , largely because diffuse light photometry is unreliable at such faint magnitude limits .",
    "we note that in two previous papers , optical disks are seen to extend to 10 optical scale lengths . in their study of ngc  5383 ,",
    "barton & thompson ( 1997 ) reach down to almost @xmath10(1@xmath1 ) . in a multiband study of ngc  4123 ,",
    "weiner  ( 2001 ) reach 29 , 29 , 28  ( 1@xmath1 ) in @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 respectively . however , we point out that both of these galaxies are strongly barred and have peculiar morphologies .",
    "we choose to focus our first study of outer disks on the sculptor group for several reasons .",
    "it is the closest galaxy group to the local group with a high proportion of disk systems .",
    "furthermore , the group has not undergone much dynamical evolution @xmath12 the galaxies are more or less isolated .",
    "their dark haloes are thought to extend far beyond the bright disks . in principle ,",
    "accretion onto the halo could give rise to disks which are much larger than normally assumed .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "our motivation for targetting ngc  300 is discussed in  2 .",
    "we briefly discuss surface photometry vs. star counts in  3 and show that the latter is the only way to get below 30  reliably , an issue we return to in the appendix .",
    "the observations and reductions under iraf are discussed in  4 , while details of the photometric calibration are given in  5 .",
    "the results are presented in  6 and these are discussed in  7 .",
    "we chose ngc  300 as a relatively undisturbed member of the closest galaxy group , sculptor .",
    "ngc  300 lies at the nearside of a distribution which is elongated along the line of sight ( jerjen , freeman & binggeli 1998 ) .",
    "there have been various distance estimates based on cepheid variables ( freedman  2001 ; gieren  2004 ) and the tip of the red giant branch ( butler  2004 ) .",
    "we adopt a weighted mean of 26.5@xmath50.1 for the distance modulus , equivalent to 2.0@xmath50.1 mpc .",
    "we show below that our photometry reaches down to an intrinsic stellar magnitude of @xmath13 ( 3@xmath1 ) which includes some of the giant branch and much of the horizontal branch in a moderately metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath14 - 1 ) population .",
    "the late type spiral galaxy ngc  300 is ideal for our proposed study .",
    "it is an almost pure disk galaxy ( bulge light @xmath15 2% ) and has a mild inclination ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the galaxy lies at high galactic latitude ( @xmath17 ) , and therefore has low foreground reddening of e(b - v)=0.013 mag .",
    "ngc 300 shares important similarities with m33 in the northern hemisphere ( blair & long 1997 ) .",
    "the optical disk scale length has been measured as 2.17 kpc in @xmath18 ( carignan 1985 ; scaled to a distance of 2.0 mpc ) and 1.47 kpc in @xmath11 ( kim  2004 ) .",
    "we note that these scale lengths would indicate that the colour of the outer disk is likely to be very blue , but this has not been measured to date ( see  7 ) .",
    "carignan s ( 1985 ; fig .",
    "8) photometric study reveals that the outermost contours are well behaved , with minimal asymmetry .",
    "there are two basic methods for detecting the faint outer reaches of galaxies : deep diffuse light imaging (  de  vaucouleurs & capaccioli 1979 ) , and faint star counts (  pritchet & van den bergh 1994 ) .",
    "surface photometry of face - on galaxies provides radial information which is more easily interpreted , but is limited by the brightness of the night sky .",
    "edge - on galaxies are easiest to search for optical breaks and truncations because of the enhanced surface brightness from the line - of - sight integration .",
    "however , with edge - on systems one can not be sure that the surface photometry is not affected by smaller - scale structures in the disk , like faint spiral arms for example , which might mimic the effects of truncation ( pohlen2004 ) .",
    "dust extinction is also more severe in edge - on systems although less so at large radius .    while diffuse light imaging is a direct method ,",
    "there are many technical difficulties at levels below @xmath19 (  pohlen  2002 ) .",
    "these include scattered light internal to the optics , difficulties of flatfielding data ( pohlen  2002 ) , zodiacal light ( bernstein  2002 ) , and diffuse galactic light ( haikala & mattila 1995 ) , a combination of dust - scattered starlight , dust luminescence , and emission from cool gas . over the sky , there are also variations in galactic cirrus ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 2000 ) , and warm ionized gas due to the reynolds layer ( reynolds 1992 ) . at fainter levels ,",
    "in the range @xmath20 , the outer hi envelope may have ( i ) a sufficient column of dust to scatter detectable levels of starlight from the optical disk ( see appendix ) , or ( ii ) sufficient levels of ionization due to a local or global radiation field to produce fluorescent emission ( maloney 1993 ; maloney & bland - hawthorn 2001 ) .    a more powerful method is to count individual stars in the old stellar population .",
    "the technique is particularly effective since good seeing allows contamination from background galaxies and foreground stars to be properly evaluated . in their study of the m31 halo ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "pritchet & van den bergh ( 1994 ) achieved 50% completeness for point sources down to @xmath22 in 1  seeing .",
    "this corresponds to an ` effective ' surface brightness limit of @xmath23  after correcting for foreground contamination and the stellar disk contribution from unresolved stars . with their 4 m ground - based observations ,",
    "pritchet & van den bergh reach to @xmath24 , corresponding to roughly 40% of starlight from the old stellar population . more recently , very deep hubble space telescope observations reach @xmath25 at 50% completeness in a relatively small 3  field ( brown2003 ) .    with stellar photometry , we can trace the disk to much fainter effective surface brightnesses by resolving individual stars .",
    "this is the motivation for our deep gmos observations .",
    "it is however crucial to establish the magnitude completeness limit and the fraction of missing light below the detection limit , which we discuss .",
    "deep @xmath26 images of ngc 300 were obtained in two outer locations using gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) on gemini south during semester 2003b .",
    "the two gmos fields lie close to the major axis of ngc 300 and span a major axis distance range of 7 to 16 kpc .",
    "our science goal was to track the radial profile of the galaxy as far as possible which required the best possible observing conditions .",
    "of the available filter set , the @xmath27 filter ( fukugita  1996 ) is the most efficient since ( i ) this is where the performance of gmos peaks ( hook  2004 ) , ( ii ) the resolved stellar population will probably be dominated by red giants , and ( iii ) the sky in @xmath26 is significantly darker than in redder bands like @xmath28 .",

    "the field locations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dss ] . the inner field ( field 1 )",
    "was placed at the optical edge identified in the digitized sky survey ( dss ) to provide continuity with earlier photographic work .",
    "while the dss limit is about 25.5  in @xmath18 ( @xmath42 ; corwin 1980 ) , the digitized survey can be displayed at high contrast to reveal a more extended disk .",
    "the disk edge is broadly consistent with the photographic limit from photographic amplification ( df malin , personal communication ) .",
    "the outer field ( field 2 ) was made to overlap slightly with field 1 in order to check the relative photometric calibration .",
    "the gmos detector comprises three @xmath43 eev ccds arranged in a row where the long dimensions are edge butted together ( hook  2004 ) .",
    "after 2@xmath442 on - chip binning , the pixels are 0.146  in size .",
    "the square field of view in a single gmos image is 5.5on a side . the on - instrument wavefront sensor and small ccd pixels provided a corrected psf of 0.60  fwhm for field 1 , and 0.63  fwhm for field 2 .",
    "the psf was found to be mildly elliptic at about the 10@xmath1215% level .",
    "a small psf is essential for removing contaminating sources in the field .",
    "the background levels between exposures varied by no more than 5% generally and the photometric conditions were excellent .",
    "each of the fields was observed in 9@xmath44900 sec dithered exposures .",
    "this allowed us to remove cosmic ray events and edge effects arising from the three edge - butted ccds .",
    "initially , we used the standard iraf / gemini reduction package .",
    "the processing pipeline includes bias subtraction and flat fielding ( _ gireduce _ ) , mosaicking of individual gmos ccds into a single reference frame ( _ gmosaic _ ) , followed by combining the 9 dithered exposures ( _ imcoadd _ ) .",
    "the images were then trimmed to the area of common coverage .",
    "the final summed images are shown as insets in fig .",
    "[ dss ] .    the fits data files arrived without field position information in the headers .",
    "our next step was to astrometrically calibrate the summed field images .",
    "this was made possible by using the gaia package developed by peter draper at the university of durham .",
    "we identified 20 stars in each field with known astrometric positions in the united states naval observatory ( usno ) photographic catalogue ( monet2003 ) .    once the fields were correctly aligned with respect to each other , we formed a mask for each field in order to reject unwanted pixels .",
    "both masks are shown in fig .",
    "we remove bright foreground stars ( @xmath45 ) , bright galaxies , and pixels which fall in the shadow of the on - instrument wavefront sensor .",
    "we also trim the outer perimeter of both fields where the snr falls off due to the dithering process . the proportion of pixels lost as a function of galactocentric radius is shown in fig .",
    "[ counts]@xmath46 , discussed below .",
    "the star counts are normalized to the dotted curves in this figure .",
    "fields 1 and 2 were analyzed using the iraf _ daophot _ package ( stetson 1987 ; davis 1994 ) .",
    "for each field , catalogues of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 source detections were produced with the _ daofind _ routine .",
    "for each catalogue , preliminary aperture photometry was obtained using the _ phot _ task .",
    "the routine _ psfselect _ was used to select approximately the 100 brightest stars which were then inspected visually .",
    "isolated stars ( i.e. without bright neighbours ) which were not saturated were chosen for psf stars . there were about 15 such stars in each field and they were used as input for the task _ psf _ which iteratively computes the point - spread function model for both fields .",
    "finally , the task _ allstar _ was run to simultaneously fit this model to stars from the _ daofind _ catalogues and determine their photometry .",
    "the task _ daophot _ identified and returned fitted parameters for 15671 and 4468 sources in fields 1 and 2 respectively ; these numbers dropped to 15390 and 4291 sources after trimming the field edges .",
    "we examined the residual maps produced by _",
    "allstar _ to evaluate psf subtraction with different thresholds .",
    "in general , the residuals were slightly cleaner for field 1 when compared with field 2 but for both fields the residuals were less than 1% of the total source flux . in fig .",
    "[ psf ] , we show a small region from field 1 before subtraction , after subtracting sources above @xmath49 and after subtracting sources above @xmath50 .",
    "the excellent photometry and source subtraction is evident .",
    "the photometric calibrations were established with two landolt fields ( see table 1 ) for which there were half a dozen useful stars in each field ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "the equivalent magnitude for a single photoelectron was determined to be @xmath51 ,  0.1 mag fainter than what is quoted at the gemini gmos web site .",
    "the photometric standards showed that the photometry was better than 0.04 mag from night to night , and better than 0.02 mag in consecutive exposures .    in fig .",
    "[ maghist ] , we show the magnitude distribution of detected sources found with _",
    "daophot_. our catalogue is complete to @xmath52 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the expected gmos performance can be assessed with the web - based calculator , with fair agreement .",
    "our calculation assumes a g5iii spectrum . for 50 percentile",
    "observing conditions , an @xmath57 point source in the @xmath58 filter requires 8100 sec ( 9@xmath4415 min dithered exposures ) for a @xmath56 detection .",
    "the conversion from @xmath59 to @xmath27 is given at the end of this section .",
    "[ maghist ] therefore establishes that the observations were undertaken in better than 50 percentile conditions . as a further check on the integrity of our data ,",
    "the star counts in the overlap region between fields 1 and 2 were compared .",
    "we find 10% more stars in field 1 compared to field 2 , which is broadly consistent with the higher average background and slightly degraded seeing in the outer field . as we stressed earlier , the psf subtraction was cleaner for field 1 compared to field 2 , and this may contribute to the difference .",
    "the magnitude offset between field 1 and field 2 was less than 0.04 mag and consistent with measurements from the landolt standards .",
    "the uniformity between fields is evident from fig .",
    "[ maghist ] .",
    "it is convenient to establish a correction from @xmath27 to @xmath59 for two reasons .",
    "most surface brightness profiles published to date are measured in traditional johnson - cousins bands (  kregel2002 ) .",
    "secondly , in a later section , we correct the star counts for the background contribution due to distant galaxies .",
    "again , galaxy count surveys to date are quoted in traditional bands ( metcalfe  2001 ) .",
    "girardi  ( 2002 ; 2004 ) derive the requisite transformation from stellar atmospheric models .",
    "in the temperature range 4000 - 10,000  k , @xmath60 changes from about 0.3 to 0.15 , with a stronger dependence for cool stars .",
    "this compares favourably with fukugita  ( 1996 ) who find @xmath61 such that for stars with @xmath62 colours of 0.2 to 0.7 , @xmath60 lies in the range 0.16 to 0.24 .",
    "thus , to a good approximation , we can convert our magnitude system to @xmath59 using @xmath63 .",
    "previous studies have shown that the slope of the radial light distribution of some disks becomes abruptly steeper at an outer break radius (  pohlen  2002 ; kregel  2003 ) ; the reason for this break is not known .",
    "we now seek to establish whether the stellar disk truncates rapidly beyond the break or extends faintly into the hi disk .",
    "both outcomes have implications for how most of the baryons must have settled during dissipation .",
    "we derive the radial profile of ngc 300 from the catalogue of fitted stars .",
    "the centre of the galaxy was taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "since the disk is inclined , we need to define elliptic annuli ; each annulus has a radial ( annular ) thickness of 100 pixels .",
    "the form of the annuli is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mask ] for which we adopt a pa @xmath64 110  and inclination @xmath16(kim  2004 ) .",
    "the angle subtended by our fields on the sky is 33  with respect to the nucleus ; this translates to 43projected onto the plane of the disk , or about an eighth of the total azimuthal extent .",
    "note that the disk major axis passes through the middle of field 1 .    in fig .",
    "[ counts]@xmath65 , we show the radial profile in ngc  300 derived from our source counts _ prior to removal of the background galaxy counts . _",
    "the form of the profile is essentially identical for the @xmath42 , @xmath54 and @xmath56 catalogues .",
    "the radial profile is normalized by keeping track of the number of pixels in each annular bin . in fig .",
    "[ counts]@xmath46 , we see that a typical bin has almost 200,000 pixels .",
    "the top hat distributions are similar in form , and overlap at 18.5 .",
    "the combined distribution gives uniform coverage from about 12.5  out to 24.5 .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the small corrections required for pixels which are masked out due to bright foreground stars , bright galaxies and so on ( see fig .",
    "[ mask ] and  4 ) .",
    "the star counts are normalized to the dotted curves in this figure .    in fig .",
    "[ counts]@xmath65 , there is a gentle transition at 19(11.4 kpc ) where the profile appears to flatten off .",
    "the transition is somewhat emphasized by the nature of the log - linear axes traditional for this field .",
    "this happens to fall in the overlap region between fields 1 and 2 , as we show in fig .",
    "[ counts]@xmath46 . however , the change in slope is not an artefact of joining two data sets , since the form of the transition is identical in both fields .",
    "the transition is an artefact of a faint background galaxy population observed through the outer disk of ngc  300 .    in order to derive the intrinsic surface brightness profile for ngc  300",
    ", we need to remove the background galaxy counts . in fig .",
    "[ subcounts ] , we show three possible levels for background subtraction . in fig .",
    "[ subcounts]@xmath65 , we take the average galaxy counts from the hubble deep fields as derived by metcalfe(2001 ) , where we have taken @xmath63 ( see  5 ) . fig  [ subcounts]@xmath46 takes the outer third of field 2 to define the background counts",
    "this is 10% higher than the averaged hubble deep field counts . given that the expected variance in a 5.5field down to @xmath66 can be as high as 50% from field to field , this would not be unexpected .",
    "the difference in counts between the hubble deep fields when integrated down to @xmath66 is about 15% ( n. metcalfe , personal communication ) .    for figs .",
    "[ subcounts]@xmath65 and @xmath46 , the key implication is that the disk extends to at least 24  ( 2.2@xmath3 ) , close to 10 optical scale lengths for this low luminosity galaxy .",
    "it is possible to remove the transition at 18.5  completely with a background level which is 100% higher than the hubble deep field counts .",
    "this outcome is presented in fig .",
    "[ subcounts]@xmath67 .",
    "in contrast to figs .",
    "[ subcounts]@xmath65 and @xmath46 , the interpretation here would be very different .",
    "the disk now appears to truncate very sharply at 18 , or about 50% further out in radius than the holmberg radius .",
    "such a cut - off corresponds to about 6 optical scale lengths , although note that the disk is still detected to 1.9@xmath3 .",
    "while we consider this high background level to be unlikely , it can not be ruled out until more of the outer perimeter of ngc  300 has been mapped under similar observing conditions .",
    "we are not able to separate faint stars from faint background galaxies using the gmos images .",
    "we attempted to separate these with _ sextractor _ but most of the sources identified as galaxies could not be distinguished from stars convolved with the mildly elliptic psf .",
    "we therefore make the basic assumption that stars and galaxies have the same magnitude distribution in the range @xmath68 .",

    "puche  ( 1990 ) have mapped the outer disk in ngc 300 and detect hi out to 32 , beyond the extent of the newly established optical disk .",
    "the hi surface density profile is roughly constant at @xmath81 m@xmath73 pc@xmath80 in the outer disk .",
    "the surface density profile of the optical disk falls with radius , and is roughly comparable to the hi at the holmberg radius , assuming @xmath82 . beyond here",
    ", the optical surface density falls by a factor of 100 at a radius of 20  or more .",
    "the existence of stars at such low surface densities is difficult to understand in the conventional picture .",
    "how does a spiral density wave initiate and propagate ",
    "if this is indeed what triggered star formation in the outer disk  in such a rarefied medium ?",
    "the @xmath83 criterion is often used to establish whether a disk is unstable to axisymmetric modes , viz .",
    "@xmath84 where @xmath1 is the internal dispersion of the hi gas which stabilizes the disk on small scales ( up to the radius of the jean s mass ) . on larger scales ,",
    "the disk is stabilized by differential rotation which is embodied by @xmath85 , the epicyclic frequency of the disk .",
    "in contrast , the disk is destabilized by its own surface density , @xmath86 .",
    "the disk is locally stable against axisymmetric modes if @xmath83 is substantially above unity .",
    "we derive @xmath87 and @xmath88 from the data of puche(1990 ) and assume @xmath89  in the outer disk .",
    "we thus find that @xmath83 is everywhere greater than 5@xmath52 beyond 10  which would appear to argue against star formation and the existence of spiral density waves here .",
    "however , the observations of puche  ( 1990 ) not only show that the hi extends well beyond the extent of our stellar disk but also reveal well - defined , tightly wound spiral structure in the hi which is particularly prominent in the se at 20 . while this spiral structure is difficult to explain ,",
    "it is interesting that hi spiral arms are increasingly observed in the outer parts of disk galaxies ( ta oosterloo , personal communication ; bureau  1999 ; quillen & pickering 1997 ) .",
    "bureau  found a similar problem for the hi disk of ngc 2915 , which also shows marked spiral structure at very large radius ; they invoked the effect of a tumbling triaxial halo potential to drive the spiral structure in this apparently stable outer disk .",
    "it is known from photometric imaging studies ( e.g. de jong 1996 ) that most hubble types have colour gradients from the centre outwards which arise from ( i ) the decreasing dust content ; ( ii ) declining stellar abundances ; and ( iii ) changing stellar populations due to radial variations in star formation history .",
    "the general trend is that disks become progressively bluer at larger radii and this has been ascribed to the stellar population becoming younger on average and progressively more metal poor ( de jong 1996 ) .",
    "however , the inference that the stellar populations become progressively younger with radius contrasts with what we know from recent stellar photometry of the outermost reaches of nearby galaxies .",
    "these studies incorporate high quality stellar photometry and show , by comparison with well calibrated globular cluster data , that the outer giant populations are metal poor and old .",
    "recent examples include the outer disks of m33 ( galleti , bellazzini & ferraro 2004 ) and m31 ( ferguson & johnson 2001 ) .",
    "the data for ngc 300 are limited at present but tikhonov(2005 ) find that metal poor ( [ fe / h]=-0.87 ) giants dominate the light at large radius and these are most likely to be old .",
    "we note that tikhonov  attribute various regions of ngc 300 to the thick disk or to the halo which is difficult to do in a relatively face - on galaxy .",
    "one can really only rely on indirect arguments based on our galaxy , but these are very unreliable .",
    "for example , their outermost field ( s3 ) corresponds to a deprojected radius of about 11 kpc or roughly 6 scale lengths . in our galaxy",
    ", this corresponds to about 20 kpc where we know nothing about the stellar disk at the present time .",
    "so is the outer disk in ngc 300 young or old ?",
    "when one considers the effects of changing extinction and metallicity , a moderately blue outer disk does not necessarily indicate a younger stellar population .",
    "( galleti  ( 2004 ) discuss how age and metallicity effects can be disentangled in outer disk / halo observations . ) within the context of cold dark matter models , the answer to this question has key implications for the formation scenario for the outer disk ( e.g. ferguson & johnson 2001 ) .    if follow up measurements reveal that the outer disk is moderately young , we would expect to find evidence of spiral density waves in the stellar population even at the implied large radii ( @xmath9012 kpc ) , although these spiral arms may be moderately diffuse and hard to recognize . as mentioned above",
    ", there is clear evidence of spirality in the outer hi disk .",
    "if stars are forming today , it may be that the outer hi disk largely comprises cold , compact clouds with internal dispersions lower ( @xmath91 ) than one normally associates with beam - averaged observations of outer disks ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "if the hi gas was to cool to 100 k , and nonthermal ( e.g. turbulent ) velocities were @xmath91 , the @xmath83 criterion could be as low as unity .",
    "such clouds would be gravitationally unstable today and the outer disk would have a moderately young stellar component .",
    "but we stress that , to our knowledge , the hi velocity dispersion has not been measured in distinct clouds in the outer disk of ngc 300 .",
    "if new measurements reveal that the outer disk is old , then the current high value of @xmath83 here may simply reflect that the hi has been largely used up today , but that there was a time @xmath9310 gyr ago @xmath94 when there was far more gas than we observe today .",
    "if our assumption of the cloud dispersion velocity still holds , this would have the effect of raising the surface density of the disk , and lowering the @xmath83 parameter to the point where local instabilities induce star formation .",
    "hydrogen in the outermost reaches of galaxies may be evidence for gas accretion , either from gas settling onto the dark halo ( cold accretion ) , or from a galaxy merger event ( hot accretion ) .",
    "if the material in the slow warp in ngc 300 is the result of gas accretion to the outer disk , it is plausible that the settling process produced low levels of star formation .",
    "an example of such a process is dramatically illustrated by the gas disk settling within the giant elliptical ngc  5128 where a young blue population is clearly evident ( graham 1979 ; bland , taylor & atherton 1987 ) .",
    "but how does an accretion process succeed in maintaining the continuity of the exponential disk ?",
    "this is particularly puzzling when the surface brightness distribution is contrasted with that of most other spirals , which show a clear break in their light distribution at 3 to 5 radial scale lengths .",
    "could the lin - pringle viscous evolution of a star - forming disk explain the persistence of the exponential disk of ngc 300 to ten or more scale lengths ?",
    "another possibility is that the stars were scattered from the inner disk .",
    "n - body simulations of disk evolution indicate that radial mixing is strong ( sellwood 2002 ) .",
    "a single spiral wave near co - rotation can perturb the angular momentum of a star by @xmath9320% moving it either inwards or outwards by several kiloparsecs ( sellwood & kosowsky 2002 ) .",
    "this process could help to wash out any stellar disk edge",
    "but it is difficult to see how this explains the very extensive stellar disk , with a simple exponential density profile , observed here .",
    "jbh would like to dedicate this work to his brother simon who died in december 2004 .",
    "we thank the staff of the gemini observatory for their tireless efforts and their pursuit of excellence .",
