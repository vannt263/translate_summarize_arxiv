    "initial experimental reports on the alkali - intercalated iron selenide materials of nominal composition afe@xmath0se@xmath0@xcite indicated a number of surprising results@xcite which apparently differentiated these materials from their iron chalcogenide and iron pnictide superconductor cousins .",
    "in contrast to these last systems , nearly all of which have hole and electron fermi surface pockets present simultaneously , angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) studies suggested that there were no hole - like fermi sheets for some dopings.@xcite secondly , the resistivity of these samples were all remarkably large , suggesting a proximity to a metal - insulator transition .",
    "finally , a phase of ordered fe vacancies supporting a large antiferromagnetic ordered moment arranged in a @xmath6 block spin pattern was reported by elastic neutron scattering.@xcite the implications of all these anomalous features for superconductivity in these systems , which occurs at temperatures as high as 31k , is not presently clear .",
    "indeed , it is not even established whether superconductivity coexists with the vacancy ordered phase , arises in fe vacancy - free regions , or is found in disordered vacancy regions of the multiphase samples .    from the theoretical standpoint , various authors constructed models based on the early arpes data and investigated new physics associated with the absence of the hole pockets . within spin fluctuation theory ,",
    "the consequences of this fermi surface topology was already discussed by kuroki _",
    "et al._,@xcite who pointed out that this band structure is a 2d version of  agterberg - barzykin - gorkov \" nodeless @xmath1-wave superconductivity @xcite , since the symmetry - enforced nodal lines fall between the fermi surfaces .",
    "this idea was adopted in the context of the new systems by several authors .",
    "wang _ et al._@xcite predicted based on a functional renormalization group ( frg ) calculation that a @xmath1-wave state would be favorable in such a situation , with an @xmath3 state a close competitor , and suggested that the latter possibility was due to the  marginal \" hole band just below the fermi level in their calculations .",
    "et al._@xcite performed similar calculations in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and also found competing @xmath7 and @xmath8wave order for large electron doping , but only @xmath1-wave pairing stabilized in the absence of hole fermi pockets@xcite .",
    "these authors also found a strong peak in the dynamical susceptibility not at the wave vector @xmath9 corresponding to the nesting wave vector of the two electron pockets in the 1-fe brillouin zone , but rather close to @xmath10 , the vector connecting the closest flat sides of the rather square electron pockets .",
    "mazin @xcite and khodas and chubukov @xcite have discussed the role of hybridization and the appearance of an @xmath3 state , in which the gap changes sign between the hybridized electron pockets .",
    "other authors considered weak - coupling models involving proximity to or coexistence with simple magnetic stripes,@xcite with the @xmath11 block state,@xcite or considered similar electronic structure in orbital fluctuation pairing models@xcite .",
    "strong - coupling models predicting fully gapped @xmath12-like states have also been proposed@xcite .",
    "a final piece of important experimental information was obtained when inelastic neutron scattering measurements on rb@xmath13fe@xmath14se@xmath0 performed by park _",
    "et al._@xcite reported a resonance in the superconducting state similar to that observed in other fe - pnictide and fe - chalcogenide superconductors@xcite _ except _ that it was observed not at @xmath15 ( in the 1-fe brillouin zone ) but at @xmath16 , very close to the value predicted by maier _",
    "et al._@xcite friemel _",
    "et al._@xcite then observed a dispersion of the resonant mode consistent with band structure calculations on rbfe@xmath0se@xmath0 , within the rpa @xmath1-wave spin fluctuation picture .",
    "this represents strong support for the itinerant nature of the mode , and its ultimate origin in the strong scattering between the electron fermi pockets in the doped metallic phase . in these experiments",
    ", there was no sign of the iron - vacancy ordering ; these authors concluded that their signal was coming from nonmagnetic , vacancy - disordered or free phases , and that an itinerant picture of the phenomenon was essentially correct .",
    "it is important to establish experimentally whether or not a @xmath1-wave state is realized in this system , since there is accumulating evidence that all other fe - based superconductors have @xmath12-wave ( albeit probably @xmath17 ) symmetry .",
    "observation of a different symmetry in this case could be consistent with the predictions of spin - fluctuation theory , which finds an increasingly competitive @xmath1-wave instability as hole pockets shrink and disappear@xcite , or it could represent a genuinely new paradigm related to the other unusual features of the alkali - intercalated chalcogenides .",
    "recently , xu et al.@xcite reported an arpes measurement on a kfe@xmath14se@xmath0 sample with a small @xmath18-centered hole pocket .",
    "if a @xmath1-wave gap is present , it must by symmetry possess nodes on such a pocket",
    ". however , the authors of ref . were unable to detect significant gap anisotropy on this pocket , and concluded that the data were inconsistent with @xmath1-wave gap symmetry . on the other hand , synchrotron - based arpes has had a great deal of difficulty observing gap anisotropy in these systems , even in situations where other probes have provided strong evidence for gap nodes ( for a discussion , see ref . ) .",
    "in addition , we argue below that it is difficult to reconcile the inelastic neutron scattering data with an @xmath12-wave state .",
    "we therefore regard the question of the symmetry of the gap in these systems as open .",
    "this paper is concerned with exploring ways in which further neutron scattering experiments on similar systems could provide information on the gap structure .",
    "we are particularly interested in how such experiments can distinguish @xmath4 @xmath12-wave and @xmath2 ( @xmath1-wave ) gap structures in systems where the underlying electronic structure consists of two electron sheets and small hole pockets which could arise upon hole doping .",
    "when the afe@xmath0se@xmath0 system is doped so as to move the hole bands through the fermi surface , one expects that as the conventional fe - pnictide type fermi surface , with two electron and two hole pockets is recovered , the system will make a transition from a @xmath2 ( @xmath1-wave ) state to an @xmath4 ( @xmath3-wave ) state .",
    "however , rpa calculations find that the @xmath2 pairing is surprisingly robust and that a near - degeneracy between the @xmath4 and @xmath2 channels occurs over a finite doping range where the hole pockets first appear .",
    "it is in this doping range that we will examine how neutron scattering can provide information on the gap structure .",
