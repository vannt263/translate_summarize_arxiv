    "since this particle is expected to be very massive , @xmath5 , and extremely non relativistic with average kinetic energy @xmath6 , it can be directly detected  @xcite@xmath7@xcite mainly via the recoiling nucleus .    using an effective supersymmetric lagrangian at the quark level ,",
    "see e.g. jungman et al  @xcite and references therein , a quark model for the nucleon  @xcite and nuclear wave functions  @xcite one can obtain the needed detection rates .",
    "they are typically very low .",
    "so experimentally one would like to exploit the modulation of the event rates due to the earth s revolution around the sun . in our previous work @xcite@xmath0",

    "the factor of @xmath32 is introduced , since we have chosen to normalize our results to the usual differential rate .",
    "we will now examine the consequences of the earth s revolution around the sun ( the effect of its rotation around its axis is expected to be negligible ) i.e. the modulation effect .",
    "following sikivie we will consider @xmath33 caustic rings , ( i , n ) , i=(+.- ) and n=1,2, ... n ( n=20 in the model of sikivie et al ) , each of which contributes to the local density a fraction @xmath34 of the the summed density @xmath35 of each type @xmath36 . and",

    "we find it convenient to choose the z - axis in the direction of the motion of the the sun , the y - axis is normal to the plane of the galaxy and the x - axis is in the radial direction .",

    "the rate will depend on the direction of observation , showing a strong correlation with the direction of both the sun s and the earth s motion . in the favorable situation",
    "the rate will merely be suppressed by about a factor of @xmath64 relative to the non - directional rate .",
    "this is due to the fact that one does not now integrate over the azimuthal angle of the nuclear recoiling momentum .",

    "we have focused on the lsp density and velocity spectrum obtained from a recently proposed non - isothermal model , involving caustic rings @xcite .",

    "the quantities @xmath59 and @xmath58 are given in table 1 .",
    "we see that the maximum in this model does not occur around june 2nd , but about six months later .",
    "the difference between the maximum and the minimum is about @xmath75 , i.e. smaller than that predicted by the asymmetric isothermal models @xcite .    for the directional experiments we found that the biggest rates are obtained close to the direction of the sun s motion .",
