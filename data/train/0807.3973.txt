    "during the last several years an opportunity for @xmath3 meson studies at the @xmath4 colliders running at the @xmath0(5s ) resonance has been extensively explored . the first evidence for @xmath3 production at the @xmath0(5s )",
    "was found by the cleo collaboration @xcite using a dataset of 0.42fb@xmath2 collected in 2003 .",
    "this study indicated that practical @xmath3 measurements at the @xmath0(5s ) are possible with a dataset of at least 20fb@xmath2 , which can be easily collected at @xmath1 factories running with @xmath510@xmath6@xmath7sec@xmath2 luminosity . to test the feasibility of a @xmath3 physics program the belle collaboration collected at the @xmath0(5s ) a dataset of 1.86fb@xmath2 in 2005 .",
    "after the successful analysis of these data @xcite , belle collected a bigger sample of 21.7fb@xmath2 in 2006 .",
    "several @xmath9 resonances have been observed in the @xmath4 hadronic cross - section in the energy region @xmath510 gev @xcite . among these resonances , the @xmath0(4s )",
    "has a mass slightly above the @xmath10 production threshold and decays to @xmath11 or @xmath12 pairs with almost 100@xmath13 probability .",
    "the next @xmath0(5s ) resonance has a mass exceeding the @xmath14 production threshold and can potentially decay to various final states with the @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath3 mesons .",
    "if the @xmath3 production rate at the @xmath0(5s ) is not small , the @xmath0(5s ) could play a similar role for comprehensive @xmath3 studies that the @xmath0(4s ) has played for @xmath15 and @xmath16 studies .",
    "hadronic events produced at the energy region of the @xmath0(5s ) can be classified into the three categories ( fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath0(5s ) resonance events , @xmath9 continuum events , and @xmath17 continuum events . the @xmath0(5s )",
    "resonance events and the @xmath9 continuum events ( contributions from these two sources are expected to be about the same ) always produce the final states with a @xmath1 or @xmath18 meson pair , and , therefore , can not be topologically separated .",
    "we define the @xmath9 continuum and @xmath0(5s ) events collectively as the @xmath9 events .",
    "all @xmath9 events are expected to hadronize in final states with the @xmath19 meson pair : @xmath10 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath14 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "here @xmath1 denotes a @xmath16 or a @xmath15 meson and @xmath31 denotes a @xmath32 or a @xmath33 meson .",
    "the excited states decay to their ground states via @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "all possible final states can be separated into @xmath18 and @xmath1 channel events ; the @xmath18 channel events include three channels : with zero , one or two @xmath36 mesons .        in order to measure any @xmath3 branching fraction",
    ", the number of @xmath3 mesons in a collected @xmath0(5s ) data sample has to be precisely determined . to calculate the @xmath3 number in a dataset with known integrated luminosity @xmath37",
    ", the two parameters should be measured in advance : the total @xmath9 production cross section at the @xmath4 center - of - mass energy @xmath38 , and the fraction @xmath39 of @xmath3 events among all @xmath9 events .",
    "then the number of @xmath3 mesons in a dataset can be calculated as : @xmath40 .",
    "for some @xmath3 decays with a high background level it is reasonable to select events only from the @xmath30 channel . in this case the fraction @xmath41 of @xmath30 events over all @xmath42 events should be also measured .",
    "the total @xmath9 cross section @xmath38 can be determined by comparing the number of hadronic events produced at the @xmath0(5s ) and on the continuum below the @xmath0(4s ) energy .",
    "after corrections for the integrated luminosity ratio , the center - of - mass energy ratio and the reconstruction efficiency ratio , the number of events in continuum dataset will reproduce the number of @xmath43 and @xmath44 continuum events in the @xmath0(5s ) dataset .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty in the continuum subtraction method comes from the @xmath0(5s ) and continuum luminosity ratio , which is usually calculated using bhabha events . in the belle measurement",
    "@xcite a @xmath45 systematic uncertainty on the integrated luminosity ratio @xmath46 resulted in the @xmath47 systematic uncertainty on @xmath38 .",
    "probably with higher statistics , the @xmath0(5s ) and continuum dataset integrated luminosity ratio can be better measured comparing @xmath48 and @xmath49 production at the high momentum region .",
    "unfortunately the @xmath38 uncertainty can not be essentially reduced below @xmath50 using continuum subtraction methods , and it would become a `` core '' uncertainty on the full @xmath3 number determination with increasing statistics . by",
    "now the @xmath38 value was measured by cleo @xcite to be @xmath51nb and by belle @xcite to be @xmath52nb .",
    "the @xmath39 value can be determined by comparing @xmath49 , @xmath48 or @xmath53 production in @xmath0(5s ) , @xmath0(4s ) and continuum datasets .",
    "this method is based on the fact that the @xmath49 and @xmath53 meson production rate is significantly higher in @xmath3 decays than in @xmath54 decays ( and lower for the @xmath48 meson ) . unfortunately an additional model dependent assumption on the inclusive branching fraction of @xmath49 , @xmath53 or @xmath48 production in @xmath3 decays has to be made .",
    "currently the mean pdg value @xcite , based on cleo and belle measurements , is @xmath55 .",
    "although the uncertainty can be decreased by about a factor of two with larger statistics , this method includes a model dependence and has an unavoidable basic uncertainty .",
    "several model independent methods have been discussed ( using double @xmath49 production , lepton correlations , vertex information , low momentum photons and so on ) , however these methods mostly require rather large statistics or include a model dependent parameter .",
    "generally , we expect to reduce the @xmath39 uncertainty to @xmath56 with currently available statistics of 23.6fb@xmath2 .",
    "the last unknown @xmath41 value was recently measured with improved accuracy : @xmath57 @xcite .    the total uncertainty in the number of @xmath3 is expected to come down from @xmath58 to @xmath59 due to the belle statistics increase from 1.86 fb@xmath2 to 23.6 fb@xmath2 .",
    "at the moment the most significant uncertainty on the @xmath3 number comes from the @xmath39 uncertainty .",
    "it is important to develop a robust method to determine @xmath39 in a model independent way .",
    "the uncertainty on the @xmath41 value is smaller than other uncertainties on the number of @xmath3 and will be further reduced with increasing statistics .",
    "@xmath3 signals can be observed using two variables : the energy difference @xmath60 and the beam - energy - constrained mass @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the energy and momentum of the @xmath3 candidate in the @xmath4 center - of - mass ( cm ) system , and @xmath64 is the cm beam energy .",

    "the ratio @xmath82 is derived ; the errors are completely dominated by the low @xmath75 statistics .    comparing the number of events reconstructed in the @xmath72 mode in three signal regions , the fraction of @xmath30 events over all @xmath42 events was measured to be @xmath83 .",

    "in contrast to theoretical predictions @xcite the mass difference @xmath87 obtained is 2.7@xmath74 larger than the world average for @xmath88 .    the distribution of the cosine of the angle between the @xmath3 momentum and the beam axis in the cm system for the @xmath0(5s)@xmath89 decay ( in the @xmath72 mode ) is shown in fig .",

    "the corresponding branching fraction is predicted to be @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath91 decay is expected to proceed via a penguin annihilation diagram ( fig .",
    "6 , right ) and to have a branching fraction in the range @xmath93 .",
    "however , the @xmath91 decay branching fraction is sensitive to some bsm contributions and can be enhanced by about an order of magnitude @xcite ; such enhanced values are not far from the upper limit expected in this analysis .",
