    "the main subject of the heavy ion experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is to create a new state of matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is expected to be a transient thermal system of interacting quarks and gluons . due to the confinement",
    "free quarks and gluons can not be detected .",
    "the search for qgp has to be carried out by analyzing certain proposed hadronic and electromagnetic signatures @xcite .",
    "however , the possible signatures of the qgp may also come in part from the late time dynamics of a hadron gas formed after the phase transition @xcite .",
    "therefore one needs detailed informations about the creation of the qgp , its lifetime and the hadronization in order to draw reliable conclusions .",
    "recent measurements @xcite at rhic of the elliptic flow parameter @xmath4 for semi - central collisions suggest that - in comparison to fits based on simple ideal hydrodynamical models @xcite - the evolving system builds up a sufficiently early pressure and potentially also achieves ( local ) equilibrium . on the other hand ,",
    "the system in the reaction is at least initially far from any ( quasi-)equilibrium configuration . to address the crucial question of thermalization of gluons and quarks , a number of theoretical analyses",
    "have been worked out either using the relaxation time approximation @xcite or performing full @xmath5 dimensional monte carlo cascade simulations based on the solution of the boltzmann equations for quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "the first parton cascade , vni , inspired by pqcd including binary elastic scatterings ( @xmath6 ) and gluon radiation and fusion ( @xmath7 ) was developed by geiger and mller @xcite . in the simulation for a central au+au collision at rhic energy",
    "@xcite they concluded that a thermalized qgp will be formed at @xmath8 fm / c .",
    "however , the onset of potential hydrodynamical behavior during the parton evolution was not demonstrated in their analyses .",
    "in addition , the treatment of the propagation of off - shell partons in their approach is not clear from a physical point of view .",
    "recently , molnar and gyulassy studied the buildup of the elliptic flow at rhic @xcite applying an on - shell parton cascade , mpc @xcite ( an improved version of zpc @xcite ) , in which up to now only elastic gluon interactions are included . in their analysis the early pressure can be achieved only if an unrealistic , much higher cross section is being employed .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the elastic ( and forward directed ) @xmath9 collisions can not drive the system to kinetic equilibrium , as pointed out in ref .",
    "this would suggest that the collective flow phenomena observed at rhic can not be described via pqcd . on the other hand ,",
    "the possible importance of the inelastic interactions on overall thermalization was raised in the so - called `` bottom up thermalization '' picture @xcite .",
    "it is intuitively clear that gluon multiplication should not only lead to chemical equilibration @xcite , but also should lead to a faster kinetic equilibration @xcite .",
    "this represents one ( but not all ) important motivation for developing a consistent algorithm to handle inelastic processes like @xmath10 .    in solving the transport equations , in",
    "most of the cascade models cross sections are interpreted geometrically to model the collision processes .",
    "it turns out that in dense matter when the interaction length @xmath11 is not much smaller than the mean free path of particles , causality violation @xcite will arise in these cascade models and will lead to numerical artifacts @xcite .",
    "one way to reduce these artifacts is to apply the common test particle method ( or `` particle subdivisions '' ) @xcite , in which the interaction length of the test particles is reduced by @xmath12 , while the mean free path is unchanged .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the number of the test particles per real particle .",
    "however , the limitation of these transport models is obvious : inelastic collision processes with more than two incoming particles can not be straightforwardly implemented since it is in general difficult to determine , for instance , a @xmath14 process geometrically .",
    "therefore , until now , the role of the inelastic processes in the formation of the qgp has not been studied fully quantitatively .",
    "an alternative collision algorithm suggested in @xcite dealt with the transition rate instead of the geometrical interpretation of cross section and determined proceeding collision processes in a stochastic manner by sampling possible transitions in a certain volume and time interval .",
    "this collision algorithm opens up the possibility to include the inelastic collision processes into transport simulations solving the boltzmann equations @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the collision term of @xmath18 and @xmath19 processes . in this paper",
    "we will present a newly developed on - shell parton cascade using this sort of stochastic collision algorithm .",
    "also the oftenly employed scheme based on the geometrical interpretation of cross section is discussed and compared with the stochastic algorithm . in particular , we concentrate on the study of the ( unphysical ) frame dependence . the new transport scheme will then be applied to simulate the parton evolution for a central ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision at highest rhic energy .",
    "the emphasis is put on the investigation of gluon thermalization and their collective dynamics . for this investigation",
    "the initial conditions are assumed to be generated by independent minijets @xcite .",
    "other initial conditions , like the much discussed `` color glass condensate '' @xcite , can also be implemented , but we leave this for a future work . for the present study",
    "we consider quarks and gluons as classical boltzmann particles throughout the paper .",
    "the pauli blocking and gluon enhancement can , in principle , be implemented and will also be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : twobody ] we consider two - body collision processes and contrast the geometrical with the stochastic collision algorithm .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a system within a fixed box is carried out to study global kinetic equilibration .",
    "in addition , such calculations are mandatory to debug the operation of the code and to look for the limitation of the algorithms .",

    "[ sec : rhic ] we then finally present first results of cascade simulations for a central au+au collision at rhic energy .",

    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] and give an outlook for future works . in appendices [ app_colltime ] and [ app_optim ] more",
    "details of the geometrical collision algorithm are given .",
    "we list the pqcd partonic scattering cross sections in appendix [ ppcs ] for two - body processes and in appendix [ ggcs ] for @xmath10 processes . in appendix [ sampl ]",
    "the numerical recipes for monte carlo samplings are presented .",
    "we consider a system consisting of classical , ultrarelativistic particles which are interacting via two - body collisions .",
    "the main emphasis is put on the numerical realization of such collision sequences in a relativistic transport simulation , which is theoretically based on the solution of the boltzmann equations ( [ boltzmann ] ) with the following collision term given by @xmath20 @xmath21 will be set to @xmath22 when considering the double counting if @xmath23 and @xmath24 are identical particles . otherwise @xmath21 is set to @xmath2 .    since no mean field is considered throughout the present study ,",
    "the evolution of particles is intuitively straightforward : particles move along straight line between two collision events . after a particular collision the momenta of colliding particles",
    "are changed statistically according to the differential cross section .",
    "the determination of the collision sequence is , however , not unique and depends on the particular numerical implementation .",
    "we present in this section two numerical methods dealing with the realization of binary collisions .",
    "comparisons between these two methods will be made in detail when investigating kinetic equilibration in a fixed box .",
    "we also study any potential ( but unphysical ) frame dependence of transport simulations within both schemes and how to minimize possible deficiencies .",
    "these results will be presented later in sec .",
    "[ sec : frame ] .      in the first method",
    "a collision happens when two incoming particles approach as close to each other that their closest distance is smaller than @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the total cross section for the colliding particles .",
    "in other words , the collision probability is either @xmath2 or @xmath27 , depending on how close the collision partners come together . since the total cross section is interpreted geometrically , we label this procedure the `` geometrical method '' . in this picture of the closest approach , which is already employed in parton cascade models like zpc @xcite , mpc @xcite and pcpc @xcite , collisions do happen one by one as time proceeds .",
    "the next collision event can be determined by comparing the individual times marking the occurrence of the various and possible collisions .    unlike the total cross section the closest distance is , however , not invariant under lorentz transformation .",
    "this leads to the situation that a particle pair collides in one frame , but might not in another frame , which is unphysical .",
    "one faces here a violation of covariance , which is a historic problem in microscopic simulation within relativistic transport models . in the present scheme",
    "we define the closest distance in the center of mass frame of the individual particle pair @xcite and thus make it to be a lorentz invariant quantity by hand . in spite of this definition the covariance of the boltzmann equation is still not fulfilled , because the time ordering of collisions might be changed under lorentz transformation @xcite .",
    "still , for a sufficiently dilute system the geometrical method works rather robust",
    ". we will continue discussing this problem of covariance violation later in this section and also in sec .",
    "[ sec : frame ] .",
    "besides the problem just mentioned , the _ ordering time _ of one particular collision itself which orders the occurrence of all collisions in a particular frame , called lab frame , is not well defined .",
    "since we determine the closest distance of two incoming particles in their center of mass frame , it is reasonable to define the collision points for the two particles also in this frame at the closest distance and at the same time .",
    "consequently both particles , if they do collide , change their momenta at the same time in their center of mass frame , but generally at different times in the lab frame .",
    "( we now denote these individual two times by `` collision times '' . ) one can now define the ordering time at some stage between these two collision times .",
    "there is , however , no unambiguous prescription . in general , different choices for the ordering time will lead to different collision sequences .",
    "this , as numerically verified , does not strongly affect the behaviors of physical ( ensemble averaged ) quantities shown below . in our simulation",
    "we choose the smaller one of the two collision times as the ordering time . in zpc @xcite and mpc",
    "@xcite the ordering time was taken as the average of the two collision times .    in order to demonstrate the correct operation of the numerical realization of the geometrical method",
    ", we will choose a situation when the outcome is known analytically .",
    "for this purpose we carry out `` box calculations '' , in which a particle ensemble with a nonequilibrium initial condition is enclosed in a fixed box and will evolve dynamically until an appropriate final time .",
    "the collisions of particles against the walls of the box are simply done via mechanical reflections . for sufficiently long times , the system should get kinetically equilibrated at the end . for a classical , ultrarelativistic ideal gas",
    "the energy distribution has the boltzmann form @xmath28 which guides as an analytical reference for the numerical results .",
    "the temperature @xmath29 can be obtained from the simple relation between energy and particle density @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are solely given by the initial conditions .",
    "initially , particles are now distributed homogeneously within the box and their momentum distribution is chosen highly anisotropic via @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ box1 ] the final energy distribution from such box calculations for a system of @xmath34 massless particles is depicted .",
    "the size of the box is set to be @xmath35 fm @xmath36 @xmath35 fm @xmath36 @xmath35 fm .",
    "we consider isotropic collisions and take a constant total cross section of @xmath37 mb .",
    "the final time is set to be @xmath35 fm / c .",
    "( as one will shortly realize , this chosen time is sufficient long for the system to become equilibrated . ) to improve statistics we have collected particles from @xmath38 independent realizations .",
    "the dotted line depicted in fig .",
    "[ box1 ] denotes the analytical distribution ( [ diste ] ) with temperature @xmath39 gev .",
    "we see a nice agreement between the numerical result and the analytical distribution except a slight , but characteristic deviation at low energies .",
    "we will come back to explain this discrepancy immediately .",
    "such a successful passing of the previous test is necessary for every collision algorithm , but it is still not a sufficient argument to guarantee whether the presented algorithm is operating correctly .",
    "one has to ask any numerical algorithm for its limitation of correctly describing the underlying problem . to be specific when considering the collision integral ( [ cterm1 ] ) , it is not obvious whether the geometrical interpretation of the total cross section is a reasonable choice to account for the boltzmann process .",
    "in fact such a description has some shortcomings concerning causality violations which have been pointed out for example in ref .",
    "@xcite . especially for the algorithm presented above",
    "we have to face the fact that the collision times of colliding particles are different in the lab frame .",
    "this will lead to a noticeable reduction of the collision rate compared to one given by the collision integral : assume that the difference of the collision times is @xmath40 .",
    "consequently the particle with larger collision time should not collide again during this interval @xmath40 , otherwise causality would be violated . as pointed out in appendix [ app_colltime ] , for a system in equilibrium the ensemble averaged time delay @xmath41 depends only on the total cross section and increases with the increasing total cross section .",
    "this will lead to an artificial increase of the mean free path and thus to a decrease of the collision rate .",
    "in other words , the collision rate decreases when noncausal collisions are forbidden .",
    "this problem has also been pointed out in ref .",
    "we can demonstrate this effect employing box calculations , in which we consider an initially kinetic equilibrated gas distributed homogenously within the box .",
    "the size of the box is taken to be the same as in fig .",
    "we employ isotropic collisions with a constant cross section of @xmath37 mb . in fig .",
    "[ box2 ] collision rates are depicted as solid squares for several particle densities .",
    "the collision rate is obtained here as the time average of the collision number . while the box size is fixed , we vary the particle number to get different densities .",
    "the solid line shows the expected relationship between the collision rate and particle density in equilibrium @xmath42 .",
    "we see a clear decrease of the collision rate when the expected mean free path @xmath43 is not much larger than the interaction length @xmath25 .",
    "such a numerical artifact would strongly slow down the kinetic thermalization of an initially highly nonequilibrium state , as , for instance , in case of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . as also clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ box2 ] , the collision rate tends to saturate at high density .",
    "the reason for this is that the collision rate has an upper limit which is exactly the inverse of the average collision time difference @xmath44 depending only on the total cross section as mentioned before .",
    "one can compute @xmath44 analytically .",
    "the detailed calculation is given in appendix [ app_colltime ] .",
    "it turns out that @xmath45 fm / c for @xmath37 mb .",
    "this indicates that the saturation value of the collision rate would be @xmath46 @xmath47 at high density .",
    "we now return to the slight discrepancy at low energy as noticed in fig .",
    "[ box1 ] and consider this as a consequence of the same effect of the relativistic time spread of collisions pointed out above , since in this particular situation the particle density is so high that the mean free path is one order of magnitude smaller than the interaction length . to confirm this suspicion ,",
    "we carry out similar calculations as in fig .",
    "[ box1 ] , but with a tiny cross section of @xmath48 mb . the energy distribution ,",
    "depicted as thick histogram , is shown in fig .",
    "[ box3 ] compared with the distribution ( thin histogram ) obtained by using @xmath37 mb .",
    "one does not see the artificial distortion in the spectrum at low energies any more when the cross section and hence the relativistic time spread is small . as a conclusion ,",
    "the relativistic time spread effect not only decreases the collision rate , but also slightly distorts the system out of equilibrium .    to suppress this numerical artifact and hence to conserve lorentz covariance",
    "we employ the widely used test particle , or `` subdivision '' , technique @xcite based on the scaling @xmath49 where @xmath13 is the number of test particles belonging to one real particle .",
    "while the mean free path is unchanged by the scaling , the interaction length is reduced by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "this consequently reduces the relativistic time spread which vanishes in the limit @xmath50 .",
    "the open squares in fig .",
    "[ box2 ] denote the results by using @xmath51 .",
    "the tendency of convergency towards the ideal limit is visible .    in fig .",
    "[ box4 ] we show the time evolution of the momentum anisotropy defined as the fraction of the average transverse momentum squared over the average longitudinal momentum squared .",
    "the initial conditions and parameters are set to be the same as in fig .",
    "the dotted line depicts the result without applying the test particle method ( @xmath52 ) and the dashed line shows the result with @xmath51 .",
    "the results confirm our reasoning that the relativistic effect of spreading of the two collision times for a colliding particle pair increases the relaxation time for achieving kinetic equilibrium .      in the last section",
    "we have determined the collision probability of two incoming particles by means of the geometrical interpretation of the total cross section .",
    "instead , one can also derive the collision probability directly from the collision term of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "when assuming two particles in a spatial volume element @xmath53 with momenta in the range ( @xmath54 ) and ( @xmath55 ) , the collision rate per unit phase space for such particle pair can be read off from eq .",
    "( [ cterm1 ] ) @xmath56 expressing distribution functions as @xmath57 and employing the usual definition of cross section @xcite for massless particles @xmath58 one obtains the absolute collision probability in a unit box @xmath53 and unit time @xmath59",
    "@xmath60 @xmath61 denotes the relative velocity , where @xmath62 is the invariant mass of the particle pair .",
    "unlike in the geometrical method where the collision probability is either @xmath27 or @xmath2 , @xmath63 now can be any number between @xmath27 and @xmath2 .",
    "( notice that , in practice , one should choose suitable @xmath53 and @xmath59 to make @xmath63 to be consistently less than @xmath2 . ) whether the collision will happen or not is sampled stochastically as follows : we compare @xmath63 with a random number between @xmath27 and @xmath2 . if the random number is less than @xmath63 , the collision will occur .",
    "otherwise there is no collision between the two particles within the present time step .",
    "we call this collision algorithm the `` stochastic method '' . since in the limit @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath65 the numerical solutions using the stochastic method converge to the exact solutions of the boltzmann equation @xcite , we divide in practice the space into sufficient small spatial cells . for a true situation",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 have to be taken smaller than the typical scales of spatial and temporal inhomogeneities of the particle densities . only particles from the same cell",
    "can collide with each other .",
    "if a particle pair collides , the collision time will be sampled uniformly within the interval ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the collision times for both colliding particles are here the same .",
    "the particle system propagates now from one time step to the next .",
    "this is different compared to the transport simulation scheme utilizing the geometrical method .    in general we also might employ , in addition , the test particle technique in order to reduce statistical fluctuations of the collision events in cells . accordingly the collision probability",
    "is changed to @xmath69 by the scaling @xmath70 .    in the following",
    "we discuss the lorentz invariance of the stochastic algorithm in the limit @xmath71 , @xmath64 and @xmath50 . since @xmath72 , @xmath73 , the distribution function @xmath74 and the total cross section are lorentz scalars , it is easy to realize from eq .",
    "( [ collrate22 ] ) that the collision number @xmath75 is a scalar under lorentz transformations .",
    "furthermore this is also true for @xmath76 , the particle number counted within a phase space interval at time @xmath77 .",
    "hence , the collision rate @xmath78 as well as the collision probability @xmath63 are scalars under lorentz transformations .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath71 , @xmath64 and @xmath50 the stochastic method yields per se a lorentz covariant algorithm . however , in practice , a non - zero subvolume @xmath53 and a non - zero timestep @xmath59 disturb full lorentz invariance explicitely .",
    "any potential , but unphysical frame dependence will be discussed later in sec .",
    "[ sec : frame ] .    to test and demonstrate the stochastic method we again pursue box calculations .",
    "the initial conditions are the same as in fig .",
    "the size of the box is set as before to be @xmath35 fm @xmath36 @xmath35 fm @xmath36 @xmath35 fm .",
    "since we consider a spatially homogeneous initial situation of particles and this configuration will not change very much during particle propagation , we choose a straightforward static cell configuration and divide the box into equal cells .",
    "the cell length is set to be @xmath2 fm in the calculations .",
    "we consider isotropic collisions and use a constant total cross section of @xmath37 mb .",
    "figure [ box5 ] shows the final energy distribution obtained by an average over @xmath38 independent runs ( with @xmath52 ) .",
    "one clearly recognizes that the stochastic collision algorithm also passes this basic test .",
    "the agreement between the numerical and analytical distribution is perfect and we do not see any distortion in the spectrum in contrast to the situation experienced in fig .",
    "[ box1 ] .    since the stochastic method is based directly on the formal collision rate , thus the numerical realized collision rate should be met in transport simulations if the sampled statistics in each cell is sufficiently high .",
    "we extract the collision rates from box calculations employing the stochastic method and show the results in fig .",
    "[ box6 ] as solid squares .",
    "the box size and cell configuration are set to be the same as in fig .",
    "the system is taken at thermal equilibrium for the initial condition .",
    "one nicely recognizes that the squares lay on the expected line .",
    "( we do mention here that the box size is fixed and we vary the particle number to simulate different particle densities .",
    "for instance , a density of @xmath2 @xmath79 corresponds to a total particle number of @xmath80 , which means on average one particle per cell . for still lower densities",
    "not investigated , one would have to work in addition with a suitable amount of test particles . )    for a system which is initially out of equilibrium the lack of statistics in cells will affect the dynamical evolution of the system , since now all cells are correlated during the relaxation time . to study the effect we repeat the same simulations performed for fig .",
    "[ box5 ] starting with that particular nonequilibrium initial condition ( [ init ] ) and calculate the time evolution of momentum anisotropy .",
    "we use here the test particle method to control statistical fluctuations .",
    "figure [ box7 ] shows the time evolution of the anisotropy for different test particle numbers @xmath13 .",
    "we see that the lack of statistics in cells leads to a slight slowdown in the momentum relaxation .",
    "this effect is reduced by using larger values for @xmath13 , which in turn results in lower statistical fluctuations .",
    "let us summarize with some comparisons between the two simulation methods of treating collisions as presented in this section . in the simulation employing the stochastic method ,",
    "the collision rate is correctly realized if the statistics in the individual cell is sufficiently high .",
    "in contrast , the collision rate will be numerically suppressed in the simulation using the geometrical method , when the mean free path is not much larger than the interaction length among test particles . in simulations with both algorithms",
    "the test particle technique has to be applied in addition in order to solve the boltzmann equation with sufficient accuracy .",
    "for dense and strongly interacting system , convergence of the numerical results with increasing test particle number turns out to be more efficient in simulations employing the stochastic method than in simulations employing the geometrical method , as shown in fig .",
    "[ box4 ] . in transport simulations applying the stochastic method we have to face the difficulty of dynamically configurating the space into small cells , which is not necessary in the geometrical method .",
    "furthermore , the time step has to be chosen much smaller than the cell volume to avoid a strong change of the density distribution in cells .",
    "this , of course , reduces the computing efficiency . in general",
    "one should choose such a collision algorithm , so that numerical expense is small .",
    "however , the stochasic method offers an advanced technique when dealing with inelastic collision processes , which is the subject of the next section , whereas it might be rather impossible to get a unique and consistent geometrical picture for multiparticle transition processes like @xmath19 for instance .",
    "a further comparison between the two algorithms will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : frame ] concerning any potential , but unphysical lorentz frame dependence of the algorithms .",
    "in this section we will now immediately extend the stochastic method to the more complicated particle multiplication and annihilation processes involving more than two particles .",
    "these processes are essential to drive the system towards chemical equilibrium and also do contribute to kinetic equilibration .",
    "the simplest processes are @xmath19 . in physical terms",
    "such processes will be specified then later in the paper as gluon bremsstrahlung and its back reaction .",
    "we note that the stochastic method has already been employed for @xmath19 processes in deuteron production @xmath81 @xcite and antibaryon production via , e.g. , @xmath82 @xcite with much simpler and factorized matrix elements .",
    "the true complication in the following is to incorporate the true bremsstrahlung matrix element .",

    "the collision term corresponding the @xmath19 processes of identical particles is given by the expression @xmath83 the collision probability @xmath84 for a particle multiplication process can be derived analogously to eq .",
    "( [ p22 ] ) as @xmath85 where the total cross section @xmath86 is defined as @xmath87 one can also extend the geometrical method to the multiplication processes .",

    "since particles are initialized longitudinally within a limited spatial region in rapidity , the pictures of the expansion in the two frames will be quite different .",
    "the expansion in the lab frame is symmetric , while in the boosted frame the right part of the system expands faster than the left part at late times .",

    "finally we determine the initial momentum according to the thermal distribution ( [ bjorken ] ) at @xmath271 for given @xmath238 .",
    "the initial positions and momenta of particles in the boosted frame are obtained by lorentz transformations from the lab frame .",
    "before we concentrate on the further analysis , we have to make sure that the cell configuration constructed in the last section is really suitable for an expanding system simulated by employing the stochastic method . to demonstrate this we perform a one dimensional expansion in the lab frame with the parameters set in the last section and extract @xmath247 distribution at time @xmath77 .",
    "one expects that the distribution will be constant over a large region , since this was the basis motivation for the cell construction .",

    "( remember that the size of the @xmath238 bins is set to be @xmath259 . )",
    "one can also realize that this structure approaches a characteristic final shape at late times .",
    "the meaning of the structure is that particles in a cell are spatially centered .",
    "this has no physical reason , but comes from a numerical artifact due to the finite size of the cell structure , which can be understood as follows : we concentrate on the central @xmath238 bin , @xmath296 $ ] , and assume that the expanding system is in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "any change of the @xmath247 distribution in the central @xmath238 bin is caused from collisions among the particles and from the ongoing particle diffusion . even in the central @xmath238 bin",
    "the collective motion is still outwards in spite of the small flow velocity .",
    "there are more particles moving outwards than particles moving towards the center .",
    "suppose two extreme cases of collision occurring in the central @xmath238 bin : in case 1 two particles are moving towards the center and are approaching each other . in case 2",
    "two particles are moving outwards and back - to - back .",
    "due to the considered isotropic scattering the momentum distribution of the particles after the collision is same in both cases .",
    "since , on average , the case 2 happens more frequently than the case 1 , one can draw the conclusion that collisions in an @xmath238 bin tend to bring more particles back into the center than to push them towards the outside when the collective flow in an @xmath238 bin is indeed directed outwards .",
    "this is the reason for the artificial structure of the @xmath247 distribution in the small @xmath238 bins .",
    "on the other hand , since the distribution of @xmath247 is no more constant , the particle diffusion from the center outwards is now stronger than the diffusion towards the center .",
    "the diffusion is thus counterbalancing the particle centralization and the @xmath247 distribution will approach a final shape when the balance between the diffusion and the centralization is fully established .    in fig .",
    "[ tube20 ] we compare the @xmath247 distributions at time @xmath297 fm / c from the simulations with @xmath298 and with a smaller size of @xmath299 . in the simulation with @xmath299",

    "we see a weaking in the structure of @xmath247 , though the structure does still exist . in the limit @xmath300 ,",
    "however , the characteristic substructure in the @xmath247 distribution will vanish , since the velocity of the intrinsic collective flow in the @xmath238 bins goes to zero .",
    "therefore decreasing the size of the @xmath238 bins and using more test particles would be a natural way to reduce this numerical artifact .",
    "however , the more test particles , the longer will the computing time be .",
    "a more elaborate way which does not need further test particles is to move the cell configuration randomly from time to time .",
    "for instance , we move the central @xmath238 bin @xmath296 $ ] to @xmath301 $ ] , where @xmath302 is a random number distributed within @xmath303 $ ] . although particles in each @xmath238 bin will be still centered within each time step after collisions , but because of the random shift of the cell configuration the associated center of the bin for a particular particle is also moving , so that there is no absolute center for the particle .",
    "therefore , on average , the effect of the centralization will be washed out . in fig .",
    "[ tube20 ] we depict the @xmath247 distribution from simulations employing the improved moving cell configuration with @xmath298 .",

    "we will come back to this further artifact in the next subsection .",
    "at first we present the results from simulations without test particles .",
    "figures [ tube1 ] and [ tube2 ] show the time evolution of the particle density , energy density and temperature in the central space - time rapidity region in the two frames .",
    "the results are extracted from the simulations employing the geometrical and stochastic method respectively and are obtained by averaging @xmath230 independent realizations .",
    "the effective temperature is defined as @xmath305 and corresponds to the statistical temperature when the system is at local kinetic equilibrium .",

    "[ tube1 ] and [ tube2 ] we see that the frame dependence of the considered quantities is quite noticeable in the simulation when employing the geometrical method , while it is rather weak in the simulation employing the stochastic method .",
    "moreover and astonishingly , the `` temperature '' in the simulation with the geometrical method is increased at the beginning of the expansion .",
    "this `` reheating '' @xcite is unphysical , since the isotropic initialization of the particle system does not give any reason for an introversive pressure .",
    "the gradient of the pressure is directed outward , so that in the further evolution the longitudinal work done by the pressure should lead to a cooling of the system .",
    "we also rule out any explanation based on a possible viscous effect which might bring some effective net energy flow into the local region , because there is no reheating in the simulation with the stochastic method . from the investigations within a static box",
    "we have realized that the collision rate obtained in the simulation with the geometrical method will be suppressed when the mean free path is in the same order as ( or even smaller than ) the interaction length .",
    "this is indeed the situation at the beginning of the expansion in the tube .",
    "the suppression of collisions will obviously slow down the cooling of the system , but this can not lead to any reheating .",
    "however , the fact that particles can interact with each other over a larger distance than the mean free path makes it reasonable that the pressure could be incorrectly built up .",
    "the effect of the `` anti - pressure '' is thus a numerical artifact .",

    "the slight discrepancy can be understood as the consequence of the relative large size of the @xmath238 bins ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "in contrast , the collision rates in the simulation with the geometrical method are strongly suppressed at high densities due to the relativistic effect of the time spread of the two collision times , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : meth1 ] .",
    "the results of the @xmath308 show that particles interact in fact over very large distance at high densities in the simulation when employing the geometrical method .",
    "the decrease of the @xmath308 at the highest densities corresponding to the very beginning of the expansion is due to the fact that at the early times particles with large @xmath238 are still not formed . in the simulation employing the stochastic method the interaction length is , however , controlled by the cell structure . in summary",
    ", we suspect that the larger interaction distance ( compared with the mean free path ) may be the reason for the `` reheating '' .",

    "the humps indicate a net particle diffusion towards the expansion center , which again can be explained as a consequence of the `` antipressure '' effect : the introversive pressure drives the particles back to the expansion center . in the distributions",

    "since the analysis of transverse flow , which we want to address in a further paper , shows that the transverse flow velocity is not large close to the central region even at time of @xmath118 fm / c , the above choice with fixed radius is a reasonable compromise .    in fig .",

    "@xcite to study the possible buildup of elliptic flow .",
    "figure [ dndpt_iso ] shows the @xmath181 spectra in the central region at different times .",
    "indeed we observe fast equilibration .",
    "the spectrum at @xmath377 fm / c is almost thermal . at the later times the distributions become more and more steeper , which indicates the cooling down of the system due to ( quasi)hydrodynamical expansion .",
    "the time evolution of the momentum anisotropy , the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ rhic_aniso ] , shows that from @xmath311 fm / c the anisotropy is almost constant and slightly higher than the value of the ideal , one dimensional boost - invariant expansion , @xmath414 .",
    "moreover , also the exponent describing the cooling of the temperature ( see fig . [ rhic_temp ] ) , @xmath445 , is nearly constant from @xmath2 to @xmath3 fm / c and only slightly greater than the value of the ideal expansion , @xmath422 .",
    "all this demonstrates that for the given extreme conditions the gluon system equilibrates indeed rapidly and then expands nearly hydrodynamically according to the ideal bjorken scenario .",
    "however , of course , the constant and isotropic cross section can not be further motivated .",
    "in addition , following that particular evolution , the system would stay for a rather long time in a hot , but very dilute and undersaturated ( in its gluon number ) deconfined state ( see upper fig . [ rhic_temp ] ) .",
    "contrary , in the more realistic situation with inelastic collisions included , the temperature drops much more dramatically and the system would stay only until @xmath446 fm / c in a pure deconfined state , being then ( nearly ) fully saturated in the gluonic degrees of freedom , and will then hadronize .",
    "figure [ rhic_et ] shows the time evolution of the transverse energy per unit momentum rapidity at midrapidity for the three cases compared also in figs .",
    "[ rhic_aniso ] and [ rhic_temp ] .",
    "we see that the transverse energy decreases in the simulation including pqcd elastic and inelastic interactions and in the simulation employing an isotropic , large cross section .",
    "in contrast to the cooling of the temperature , to which the production of gluons also contributes , the decrease of the transverse energy within a unit rapidity is purely due to the longitudinal work done by the pressure ! in the simulation employing large and constant cross section , energetic gluons are extremely stopped during their formation periode , so that the transverse energy is very large at very early times and pressure seems to be already built up during the overlap of two nuclei .",
    "this leads to the following ( unrealistic ) strong explosion with drastical cooling .",
    "the unaltered behavior of the transverse energy in the simulation including only pqcd elastic scatterings indicates again that in this case the parton evolution resembles a free streaming .",
    "one observes that from times @xmath447 fm / c both the full pqcd ( including @xmath10 ) and the `` strongly coupled '' ( with isotropic @xmath444 mb ) evolution show almost the identical value and the same decrease in time for the total transverse energy per rapidity .",
    "this again manifests that both pathes resemble ( quasi)hydrodynamical behavior by performing a significant amount of ( longitudinal ) work .",
    "we have developed a new @xmath5 dimensional relativistic transport model solving the kinetic on - shell boltzmann equations . besides binary @xmath6 scatterings ,",
    "inelastic @xmath19 processes are also implemented in the cascade .",
    "the numerical emphasis is put on the extension of the stochastic collision algorithm for the back reaction @xmath14 which is treated - for the first time - fully consistently within this scheme .",
    "although the development specifically aims at a simulation of the parton evolution in an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision , the presented algorithm will certainly have more potential applications beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "also the standard geometrical collision algorithm ( based on the geometrical intepretation of cross section ) has been discussed in detail . in particular , we find out that for the case that the mean free path of particles is in the same order as or comes below the interaction length , which is always true in a very energetic ( and dense ) high - energy heavy ion collision , the results from the simulations employing the geometrical method have shown several unphysical numerical artifacts .",
    "the convergency of the numerical solution in this scheme for @xmath50 turns out to be not as efficient as it does in the simulations when employing the stochastic method .",
    "the operation of the newly developed cascade has been demonstated by investigating gluon thermalization for a central au+au collision at rhic energy .",
    "the numerical results show that starting initially from a nonthermal system made up of minijets ( with cutoff @xmath1 gev ) , the gluons in the expanding center equilibrate kinetically on a scale of @xmath2 fm / c and evolve further according to ( quasi)hydrodynamics . the system cools down due to the hydrodynamical expansion and ongoing gluon multiplication .",
    "full chemical equilibration follows on a longer time scale of about @xmath3 fm / c .",
    "we have studied the contribution of the elastic and inelastic collisions to kinetic equilibration .",
    "it turns out that the inelastic scatterings are the main responsible processes driving the system to equilibrium . without any inelastic collision channel ,",
    "the collective behavior observed nowadays at rhic can not be generated , unless one uses an unrealistic large cross section ( or equivalently a large gluon density ) to mimic a strongly interactive gluon system @xcite .",
    "we have also realized that the angular distribution of the @xmath0 processes is almost isotropic during the expansion .",
    "this leads to larger transport cross section compared with the elastic scatterings .    even in the simulations applying the stochastic algorithm",
    ", particles do collide at nonzero distance due to the nonzero spatial subvolume .",
    "therefore , one may worry about acausal effects due to larger signal velocity than @xmath448 in the cells @xcite . in principle , the spatial cell length should resolve the spatial inhomogeneities in the dynamical system .",
    "for the situation when using a @xmath395 mb cross section for mimicking a strongly interacting system , the mean free path of the particles is initially smaller than the transverse cell length . to explore whether any potential acausal effect makes some numerical artifact , we now show a simulation employing half of the default transverse cell length and four times enhanced number of test particles ( to keep the same statistics in cells ) . in fig .",
    "[ rhic_m1 ] we depict the time evolutions of the number and energy density of gluons extracted in the central region from the simulation with @xmath449 fm and @xmath450 by the dotted lines . comparing the results with those obtained with the default settings , depicted by the solid lines",
    ", we do not recognize any visible difference .",
    "this indicates that acausal effects seem to be not sensitive to the cell length when the system is rather uniformly distributed in space .",
    "moreover , we note once more that the two timescales for kinetic and chemical equilibration depend crucially on the initial gluon number .",
    "the one chosen here is rather low compared to other studies in the literature @xcite , where a factor of @xmath428 more initial gluons is assumed .",
    "this will clearly imply that the timescales for gluon equilibration within the present pqcd approach significantly shorten .",
    "hence , in the future a lot of details have to be explored : thermalization ( also of the light and heavy quarks degrees of freedom ) has to be investigated with various initial conditions like minijets , with a detailed comparison to data , or the color glass condensate , serving as input for the so - called bottom up scenario of thermalization .",
    "how likely is the latter picture for true coupling constants and not parametrically small ones ?",
    "furthermore , the indication of the hydrodynamical behavior during the expansion , which is one of the main findings from our first and exploratory study concerning rhic physics , gives strong motivation for exploring transverse and elliptic flow using this new kinetic parton cascade .",
    "can the inelastic interactions generate the seen elliptic flow @xmath4 ? furthermore , one can also compare the present calculations with some fixed and specified hydrodynamical initial conditions directly with calculations based on viscous relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite , either assuming bjorken boost invariance within an expanding tube or for full 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "such a comparison can tell how viscous the qgp really turns out to be .",
    "more practically , also the phenomenon of the jet quenching or electromagnetic radiation can be studied systematically within the new transport scheme .",
    "finally , the technique of the parallel programing is needed to improve the practical operation of the cascade . with this",
    "technique quantities like the screening mass can be calculated and incorporated more precisely and quantum effects like the pauli - blocking and gluon enhancement can be then implemented straightforwardly .",

    "due to the spatial separation , the two collision times have , in general , different values , @xmath469 .",
    "this means that one of the particles reacts later within the same collision .",
    "the transformed space coordinates at the collision times are correspondingly denoted by @xmath470 and @xmath471 .",
    "the new momenta of the particles are sampled in the c.m .",

    "we thus label the particles with @xmath474 and @xmath475 , ( @xmath455 ) , and keep the labels until their next respective collisions .",
    "for example , @xmath476 denotes the time when the last collision of particle @xmath2 occurs .",
    "it is kinematically possible that the case @xmath477 occurs .",
    "such a collision sequence is not causal , because at @xmath467 when the particle @xmath2 experiences the collision with the particle @xmath22 , the particle @xmath22 is just on the way to its last collision with some other particle . to forbid those collisions",
    "we add an additional criterion : the collision times @xmath467 and @xmath468 should be greater than @xmath476 as well as @xmath478 .",
    "illustratively , the additional criterion means that during the time interval @xmath479 , the particle , which will change its trajectory later ( it is the particle @xmath22 in the example ) , is not considered for dynamics for that particular interval .    in the following we are interested in the probability distribution of the difference of collision times , @xmath480 , in a thermal system of massless particles .",
    "in this case we have @xmath481 .",
    "if @xmath482 ( e.g. , @xmath483 ) , the particle with smaller time ( @xmath476 ) can propagate freely to the larger time ( @xmath478 ) , which does not give any effect on the whole evolution due to the additional criterion .",

    "one obtains the probability distribution of @xmath40 by the integral @xmath500 where @xmath501 is the multiple probability distribution .",

    "we realize that the probability distribution ( [ pdtc ] ) depends only on the size of the total cross section . for a constant cross section",
    "we calculate the integral in ( [ pdtc ] ) numerically .",
    "figure [ app_pdtc ] shows the results for @xmath509 mb and @xmath510 mb .",

    "then these two particular particles propagate freely until the two respective collision times when the respective momenta will be sampled according to the differential cross section .",
    "the same procedure will be repeated as long as needed .",
    "since the operation number in each step is proportional to @xmath516 , the computing time increases strongly with increasing particle number and increasing collision number .",

    "fortunately those cases do not happen frequently in practice .",
