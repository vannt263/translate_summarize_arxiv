    "dileptons observed in the nucleus - nucleus collisions travel relatively unscathed from the production point to the detector .",
    "therefore , they are expected to provide clear information about the early dense and hot stage of heavy ion collisions  @xcite , which is in contrast to the hadronic probes which often suffer from strong final state interactions and the information about the collision history carried by them may be lost due to the rescattering in the expansion phase  @xcite .",
    "one of the phenomena predicted  @xcite at higher nuclear matter densities is the restoration of chiral symmetry which is manifested in the modification of masses of the vector mesons as a function of the nuclear matter density .",
    "consequences of this effect can be observed in the dilepton ( @xmath6 ) spectra measured in nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "enhancements ( above known sources ) observed in the measured  @xcite soft lepton pair production cross sections in heavy ion collisions at the sps energies , have been attributed  @xcite to in - medium modifications of the vector meson properties rather than to reflection of a new state of hadronic matter .",
    "although , such a scenario has not been fully successful  @xcite in explaining the dilepton spectra measured in these reactions at much lower beam energies ( a few gev / nucleon )  @xcite where the temperature and density regime is different and one does not expect a phase transition .    in this context , the investigation of the dilepton production in elementary nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) collisions is of interest because the corresponding cross sections enter in the transport model calculations of the @xmath6 spectra in the heavy ion collisions .",
    "therefore , a quantitative understanding of this process is a natural prerequisite to an unequivocal determination of in - medium effects mentioned above .",
    "the study of this process is of interest in its own right as it is expected to provide deeper insight into the hadronic structure and the photon - hadron interactions",
    ". this investigation may give fundamental information on the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleon in the time - like region around the vector - meson masses which is otherwise hard to access(see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been known for some time that intermediate baryonic resonances play an important role in the dilepton production in the @xmath7 collisions .",
    "dalitz decay of the @xmath0 isobar has been shown to be a strong dilepton production channel  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the baryonic resonance n@xmath1(1520 ) has been emphasized for this process in refs .",
    "@xcite where it is pointed out that the subthreshold @xmath8 production ( and its subsequent decay ) via this resonance makes important contributions to the dilepton spectrum observed in the proton - proton ( @xmath9 ) collisions .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the dilepton production is expected to provide a useful tool to probe the parameters ( @xmath10 , coupling constants , form factors etc . ) of the nucleon - resonance - photon vertices and masses and widths of the relevant nucleon resonances .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the dilepton production in nucleon - nucleon collisions in the beam energy range of 1 - 5 gev within an effective lagrangian model ( elm ) which has been successfully applied to the description of pion and associated kaon production in @xmath9 collisions  @xcite .",
    "initial interaction between two incoming nucleons is modeled by an effective lagrangian which is based on the exchange of the @xmath11 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath12 mesons .",
    "the coupling constants at the nucleon - nucleon - meson vertices are determined by directly fitting the @xmath13 matrices of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) scattering in the relevant energy region .",
    "the effective lagrangian uses the pseudovector ( pv ) coupling for the nucleon - nucleon - pion vertex and thus incorporates the low energy theorems of current algebra and the hypothesis of pcac .",
    "the @xmath6 production proceeds via excitation , propagation and radiative decay of @xmath0(1232 ) and @xmath14(1520 ) baryonic resonance states . also included are the nucleon intermediate states ( which gives rise to the @xmath7 bremsstrahlung contribution ) .",
    "the interference terms between various amplitudes are taken into account .",
    "the gauge invariance at the electromagnetic vertices is preserved in our calculations .",
    "our model is similar in spirit to those of refs .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite no resonance contribution was considered whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite resonance contributions were limited to the @xmath0 isobar only .",
    "the latter , though , did include the interference between the nucleon and @xmath0 terms . in calculations presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath7 bremsstrahlung contributions were ignored .",
    "we would like to stress that in refs .",
    "@xcite constant matrix elements have been used for various processes and the total dilepton production cross sections have been calculated by adding the corresponding cross sections and not the amplitudes , so part of the motivation of the present study is the investigation of the so far neglected quantum mechanical effects .",
    "we investigate the role of baryonic resonances in the invariant mass spectrum of the dilepton produced in proton - proton and proton - neutron collisions at various beam energies in the 1 - 5 gev range . to this end",
    ", we present the first field theoretic calculation of the dilepton production in @xmath7 collisions where excitation , propagation and radiative decay of the n@xmath1(1520 ) baryonic resonance are fully accounted for .",
    "we also compare our calculations with the published data  @xcite on the dilepton production in elementary proton - proton collisions , by the dilepton spectrometer ( dls ) collaboration . in order to describe these data the contributions from other dilepton sources ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 dalitz decay and direct decay of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons )",
    "have also been considered .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section ii contains details of our theoretical approach .",
    "section iii comprises the results of our analysis and their discussions .",
    "the summary and conclusions of our work is presented in sec .",
    "a representative of the lowest order feynman diagrams contributing to the dilepton production as considered by us , is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the intermediate nucleon or resonances can radiate a virtual photon which decays into a dilepton ( figs .",
    "1a and 1b ) .",
    "there are also their exchange counterparts .",
    "in addition , there are diagrams of these types where the virtual photon is emitted from the nucleon line on the right side",
    ". the internal meson lines can also lead to dilepton emission ( see fig 1c ) .",
    "momenta of various particles are indicated in fig .",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are four momenta of the exchanged meson , the intermediate resonance ( or nucleon ) and the photon , respectively .",
    "to evaluate various amplitudes , we have used the effective lagrangians for the nucleon - nucleon - meson , resonance - nucleon - meson , nucleon - nucleon - photon and resonance - nucleon - photon vertices .",
    "these are discussed in the following subsections .",
    ".1 in      as done before in the investigation of @xmath18 , @xmath19  @xcite and @xmath20  @xcite reactions , the parameters for these vertices are determined by fitting the @xmath7 elastic scattering @xmath13 matrix with an effective @xmath7 interaction based on the @xmath11 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 , and @xmath12 meson exchanges .",
    "the effective meson-@xmath7 lagrangians are ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite )    @xmath21    in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) , we have used the notations and conventions of bjorken and drell  @xcite and definitions of various terms are the same as those given there . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath22 denotes the nucleon mass .",
    "it should be noted that we use a pv coupling for the @xmath23 vertex . since these lagrangians are used to directly model the @xmath7 @xmath13 matrix , we have also included a nucleon - nucleon - axial - vector - isovector vertex , with the effective lagrangian given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the axial - vector meson field .",
    "this term is introduced because if the mass of the axial meson @xmath26 is chosen to be very large ( @xmath27 )  @xcite and @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 it cures the unphysical behavior in the angular distribution of @xmath7 scattering caused by the contact term in the one - pion exchange amplitude .",
    "it should be mentioned here that @xmath26 is different from the @xmath30(1260 ) meson resonance to be discussed later on .",
    "the role of the @xmath26 vertex is to explicitly subtract out the contact term of the one - pion exchange part of the @xmath7 interaction .",
    "similar term in the coordinate space potential is effectively switched off by the repulsive hard core .    at each interaction",
    "vertex , the following form factor is introduced @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the four momentum and mass of the @xmath34th exchanged meson and @xmath35 is the corresponding cut - off parameter .",
    "the latter governs the range of suppression of the contributions of high momenta which is done via the form factor .",
    "since @xmath7 scattering cross sections decrease gradually with the beam energy ( beyond certain value ) , and since we fit the elastic @xmath13 matrix directly , the coupling constants are expected to be energy dependent . therefore , while keeping the cut - offs @xmath35 [ in eq .",
    "( 7 ) ] energy independent , we take energy dependent meson - nucleon coupling constants of the following form @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the square of the total cm energy .",
    "the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 were determined by fitting to the @xmath13 matrix to the relevant proton - proton and proton - neutron scattering data at the beam energies in the range of 800 mev to 4.00 gev  @xcite .",
    "this procedure also fixes the sign of the effective lagrangians [ eqs .",

    "in fig .  2 , we show the invariant mass spectra for dilepton production in both @xmath9 and @xmath76 collisions at bombarding energies of 1.04 gev , 2.09 gev and 4.88 gev . it can be noted that in all the cases the dominant contribution arrises from the intermediate states consisting of the @xmath0 isobar resonance .",
    "in fact the total yields are almost equal to the contributions of the @xmath0 amplitude alone .",
    "the @xmath76 cross sections are about a factor of 2 - 3 larger than those for the @xmath9 reactions even at the higher beam energy of 4.88 gev . for beam energies of 1.04 gev and 2.09 gev , the contributions of the @xmath14(1520 )",
    "terms are similar to those of the @xmath7 bremsstrahlung processes for the @xmath9 collisions , while for the @xmath76 case the latter are larger than the former . however , at 4.88 gev , the @xmath14 channel prevails over the bremsstrahlung one in both cases . any way , the @xmath0 isobar production terms are still dominant even at this high energy .",
    ".1 in    the contributions of the nucleon bremsstrahlung process ( graphs involving only intermediate nucleon lines ) are considerably larger in case of @xmath76 reaction as compared to those for the @xmath9 case for all the beam energies .",
    "we do not observe the reversal of this trend at 4.88 gev as seen in the soft - photon model calculations of ref  @xcite ( where @xmath7 bremsstrahlung is larger for @xmath9 reaction as compared to that for @xmath76 one ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the off - shell behavior of the effective @xmath7 interaction is described by using a @xmath13 matrix which includes the @xmath0 degrees of freedom , instead of the meson exchange mechanism as employed in our model , the @xmath9 bremsstrahlung contributions turn out to be larger than those of ours at the bombarding energy of 1 gev .",
    "yet due to lack of calculations for the @xmath76 case , it may not be possible to make comments about the relative @xmath9 and @xmath76 bremsstrahlung contributions within this approach . in any case",
    ", the coherent sum of the @xmath0 and bremsstrahlung terms as obtained within our model are similar to those calculated with the @xmath13 matrix method .    the role of the interference effects between various terms is investigated explicitly in fig .",
    "3 where we compare the cross sections obtained by coherent and incoherent summations of the amplitudes corresponding to various processes shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the former are the same as those shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "2 . it is already noted in fig .  2 that the delta    .1 in    contributions are slightly larger than the total ones at the larger mass end of the spectrum for all the beam energies in both the cases .",
    "in fig .  3 , one can further see that the interference effects are noticeable towards the larger mass ends of the spectra for beam energies below 4.88 gev in case of @xmath9 collisions .",
    "for the 4.88 gev case these effects show up also at lower values of the invariant mass . on the other hand",
    ", they are relatively smaller for the @xmath76 case everywhere",
    ".    contributions of various terms to the excitation function ( integrated dilepton cross section ) are shown in fig .  4 for the @xmath9 ( top ) and @xmath76 ( bottom ) collisions .",
    "the total cross section at 1.04 gev is slightly larger than that at 1.27 gev in both the cases .",
    "however , after this it rises monotonously with the beam energy .",
    "the delta isobar terms dominate the total production yields for all the beam energies . for @xmath9 collisions , @xmath7 bremsstrahlung and @xmath14(1520 )",
    "terms are of similar magnitude except at the beam energy of 4.88 gev where the latter term is larger than the former . however , in the @xmath76 case , the @xmath7 bremsstrahlung contributions are larger than those of the @xmath14(1520 ) at lower beam energies while the two terms contribute similarly at 4.88 gev . furthermore , the difference in the interference effects of    .1 in    various terms in two case , should also be noted .",
    "cross sections obtained by coherent ( shown by open circles ) and incoherent ( shown by plus signs ) summations of the amplitudes differ very slightly for all the beam energies in case of the @xmath76 collisions and at energies smaller than 4.88 gev for the @xmath9 case .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the regions where the interference effects are visible in fig .  3 ,",
    "contribute very little to the integrated cross sections for these cases .",
    "however , the interference effects do show up even in the total dilepton yields for @xmath9 collisions at 4.88 gev beam energy .",
    "the cross sections shown in figs .  2 and 3 can not be compared data of the dls collaboration .",
    "they have to be folded with appropriate experimental filter , which is a function of the invariant mass ( @xmath77 ) , transverse momentum ( @xmath78 ) and the rapidity in the laboratory frame ( @xmath79 ) of the produced dileptons .",
    "we have used the dls acceptance filter ( version 4.1 ) in the folding procedure . in fig .  5",
    ", we present a comparison of the folded invariant mass spectra ( which also include the final mass resolution  @xcite ) and the data from the dls collaboration .",
    "we note that at the beam energies of 1.04 gev and 1.27 gev the effective lagrangian model calculations are able to describe the data reasonably well in the region of    .1 in    @xmath80 0.1 gev . however , at beam energies higher than 1.27 gev , our calculations fail to reproduce the data , being lower than them by factors ranging from 2 - 20 .",
    "clearly , with increasing beam energy , other dilepton sources become important ; these include dalitz decays of hadrons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 )  @xcite , direct decay of @xmath5 and @xmath4 meson to dileptons , processes leading to multi - hadronic final states  @xcite and two pion annihilation  @xcite .",

    "therefore , this theory could be useful in making predictions for the dilepton spectra to be measured by the hades spectrometer at gsi , for beam energies in this region .    in order to study the role of other dilepton production processes not considered in the present effective lagrangian model",
    ", we have included",

    "we have shown explicitly only the contributions of @xmath2 and @xmath2 and @xmath3 decay processes , respectively together with the elm results as cross sections for the other decay channels are insignificant here . at incident energies of 1.61 gev and 1.85 gev",
    "we show in addition the contributions of @xmath4 direct decay also ; the @xmath5 direct decay is insignificant at these energies .",
    "however , at 2.09 gev and 4.88 gev , contributions of all the decay channels as mentioned above are shown explicitely .",
    "it is clear that now the data can be described reasonably well for all the beam energies .",
    "this comparison suggests that the lowest points in the mass distributions of the dilepton stem from the @xmath2 dalitz decay .",
    "the @xmath3 dalitz decay is important at the intermediate masses for beam energies between 1.61 gev to 4.88 gev , while @xmath4 and @xmath5 direct decay processes are important at higher mass ends of the spectra for these beam energies .",
    "in addition to these processes , the multi - hadron final state bremsstrahlung mechanism could also contribute significantly in the low mass region at the beam energy of 4.88 gev  @xcite .",
    "we would like to mention that although several processes are included in our results shown in fig .",
    "6 , the double counting problem is unlikely to be present there .",
    "the dalitz decay and the direct decay processes of dilepton production are excluded from the effective lagrangian treatment .",
    "furthermore , we have not considered the processes like @xmath85 ( termed as the subthreshold resonance production ) .",
    "therefore , problems of double counting in the vector meson direct decay contributions as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , are not present in our calculations .",
    "we investigated the dilepton production in the nucleon - nucleon collisions at beam energies in the range of 1 - 5 gev within an effective lagrangian model , which in proven to describe well the pion and kaon production in @xmath7 collisions .",
    "most of the parameters of this model are fixed by fitting to the elastic @xmath7 @xmath13 matrix ; this restricts the freedom of varying the parameters of the model to provide a fit to the data .",
    "along with the @xmath7 bremsstrahlung process , the model also includes the excitation , propagation and radiative decay of @xmath0(1232 ) and @xmath14(1520 ) intermediate nucleon resonant states .",
    "the coupling constants at vertices involving resonances have been determined from the experimental branching ratios of their decay into various relevant channels .",
    "the interference terms among various amplitudes are included in the total @xmath13 matrix .",
    "the reaction proceeds predominantly via excitation of the @xmath0 intermediate state in the entire beam energy range considered in this work .",
    "the contributions of @xmath14(1520 ) terms are relatively small .",
    "the @xmath7 bremsstrahlung contributions are also weak in comparison to those of the delta isobar except for the higher mass region of the invariant mass spectra at the beam energy of 1.04 gev . in this region of these",
    "spectra considerable interference between various terms is also visible . for the case of @xmath9 collisions ,",
    "the @xmath7 bremsstrahlung and @xmath14(1520 ) contributions are similar in magnitude at lower beam energies . however , for the @xmath76 case , the former is larger than the latter at these energies . on the other hand , for the beam energies of 4.88 gev , @xmath14(1520 ) terms are larger than those of the bremsstrahlung in both the cases .",
    "a key result of our study is that the @xmath76 bremsstrahlung is stronger than the @xmath9 one even at the beam energy of 4.88 gev .    at the lower beam energies ( 1.04 gev and 1.27 gev ) , the effective lagrangian model calculations are able to explain the data of the dls collaboration for the invariant mass distribution of dilepton emitted in @xmath9 collisions except for the lowest mass point",
    "this is encouraging in the context of the analysis of the new experimental data on the dilepton production expected shortly from the hades collaboration at gsi , darmstadt .",
    "however , at higher beam energies ( 1.61 gev , 1.85 gev , 2.09 gev and 4.88 gev ) , the effective lagrangian model underpredicts the dls data .",
    "this indicates that with increasing energy , other dilepton production sources become important .",
    "to stress this point further , we incoherently summed the @xmath2 and @xmath3 dalitz decay and @xmath4 and @xmath5 direct decay contributions to the cross sections of the elm . with this procedure",
    ", it is possible to provide a good description of the dls data on the invariant mass distribution at all the beam energies .",
    "this also removes the discrepancy observed between the effective lagrangian model calculations and the dls invariant mass distribution data for the lowest mass point at the beam energies of 1.04 gev and 1.27 gev .",
    "our study has clarified the role of @xmath0 and @xmath14(1520 ) intermediate baryonic resonance states in the dilepton production in the @xmath7 collisions .",
    "the interference effects of various terms are visible towards the large invariant mass ends of the spectra for proton - proton collisions .",
    "however , the dls experimental filter effectively cuts off this mass region .",
    "therefore , these effects do not show up when calculations are compared with the data .",
    "this may imply that an incoherent combination of resonance and decay contributions is sufficient to explain the dls data .",
    "however , with improved quality of the data this impression could change .",
    "therefore , precise data where also the hadrons in the final channel are detected would be welcome .",
    "this would put constraint on the models calculating the role of various mechanisms in the dilepton production in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the present effective lagrangian approach should be improved by including the amplitudes for the decay processes also so that they can be summed coherently with the amplitudes of the other channels considered already .",
