    "in the heavy - ion collisions , a strongly interacting hadronic system is formed  a fireball .",
    "this system is identified with a space - time region , in which the intensive hadronic reactions are running . with regard for a model describing the system , we can separate such stages of the fireball evolution as the formation of a fireball , its thermalization , hydrodynamic expansion , freeze - out , etc .    as parameters for the determination of the stages of evolution of a system , one can take the particle density @xmath2 @xcite , energy density @xmath3 @xcite , temperature @xmath4 @xcite , mean free path , rate of collisions of particles @xmath5 , etc .",
    "the same parameters are also used for the determination of the chemical and kinetic freeze - out processes @xcite .",
    "depending on the chosen parameter , one can get various fireball representations . in the present work",
    ", we use the hadron reaction rate @xmath5 ( number of reactions in a unit volume per unit time ) in a given four - dimensional region of the space - time as a parameter of the spatial evolution of the interacting system .",
    "such a quantitative estimate allows one to define the reaction zone  @xcite , which study gives a possibility to establish the space - time structure of a fireball from the viewpoint of the interaction ( collision ) intensity at every point of the space - time .",
    "then , the regions of a fireball can be distinguished by the interaction intensity that can be characterized by the number of collisions in a unit volume of the space - time .",
    "we use this quantity to estimate and to quantify various regions of the reaction zone .    another important question which can be clarified by the study of the zone of reactions",
    "is how the space - time boundary of a particular region of the reaction zone is related to the processes of kinetic and chemical freeze - outs .",
    "since the kinetic freeze - out is the process of establishment of a final distribution of hadrons in the momentum space , the sharp kinetic freeze - out hypersurface is an imaginary hypersurface , outside of which there are no collisions between radiated hadrons ( or a very small amount of collisions is admitted ) . in this sense , the space - time boundary of a reaction zone and the sharp kinetic freeze - out hypersurface can be put in correspondence .",
    "the number of reactions @xmath6 in the given space - time region @xmath7 can be evaluated in the following way : @xmath8 where the four - density of reactions @xmath9 can be evaluated , in turn , in the framework of a certain model approximation , e.g. , like that in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "@xmath9 can be calculated with the use of a distribution function @xmath10 within a transport model .",
    "the reaction zone is defined as _",
    "the space - time region where a certain fraction of all reactions of a certain type take place _  @xcite .",
    "this space - time region is chosen so that it should be the most intense with respect to the reaction rate , i.e. , it has the smallest possible volume .",
    "reactions are classified by the type and the number of particles taking part in these reactions ( see table [ tab : reacttype ] ) .",
    "the reaction zone can be calculated for various types of reactions with the use of the particular rate for a given reaction type .",
    "one can get a feeling of the definition given above , while associating the reaction zone with the flame of a candle ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zor - trz ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is the region that is the most intense with respect to exothermic `` luminous '' reactions and is basically a reaction zone ( as usual , we do not care about the regions which contain the products of the oxidizing reaction that are not visible to us ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the most central nucleus - nucleus collisions . because of the symmetry of central collisions , the reaction density does not depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath11 in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane in the cylindrical coordinates , i.e. , @xmath14 . in this case",
    "it is possible to build a three - dimensional reaction zone in coordinates @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "our task is to determine a hypersurface that confines the volume containing a certain part @xmath17 of the total number of all hadronic reactions @xmath18 .",
    "this hypersurface can be determined by the equation @xmath19 where the critical value @xmath20 satisfies the equation for a given value of @xmath21 @xmath22 it is obvious that the value of @xmath20 `` determines '' the `` luminous '' part of the reaction zone analogously to the luminous region of the flame of a candle .",
    ".*classification of reactions * [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : for - time - points ]    we also note that the maximum in the time dependence of decay reactions and , to a less extent , of fusion reactions gradually increases with the collision energy and lies in the range @xmath23  fm/@xmath24 at ags and sps energies .",
    "this rather weak energy dependence of the second maximum compared to the first maximum of reaction frequency can be attributed to the fact that the decays are mainly determined by individual properties of secondary particles rather than by the collective dynamics of a hadronic system . at ags energies ,",
    "the elastic and inelastic nucleon reactions are still most dominant in that time range , and the total reaction frequency is mostly determined by those processes . after the full overlap of the nuclei , the created system begins to expand in space , which results in a decrease of the reaction frequency under ags conditions , as the nucleon reactions and the reactions involving secondary particles become less and less intense .",
    "the structure of the reaction frequency changes at higher energies available at sps . as the collision energy increases ,",
    "the maximum overlap of colliding nuclei happens at earlier times  ( see eq .   and figs .",
    "[ fig : for - lowsps]-[fig : for - sps ] ) due to a bigger initial velocity and the lorentz contraction of colliding nuclei , while the processes involving secondary particles ( mainly , decays and fusions ) are most intense at later times in an interval of @xmath23  fm/@xmath24 .",
    "this indicates a clearer separation in time between the intense inelastic and elastic reactions involving net nucleons and the decay and fusion reactions , which involve secondary particles .",
    "the total contribution of the secondary particles becomes more significant at sps energies due to an increase of the number of secondary particles with the collision energy .",
    "the number of secondary particles ( mainly @xmath25 mesons ) is approximately @xmath26 per nucleon under ags conditions @xcite and @xmath27 under sps conditions @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", there appears the second local maximum of the reaction frequency at sps energies ( see the thick solid line in figs .",
    "[ fig : for - lowsps ] and [ fig : for - sps ] ) at @xmath28 ( see table [ tab : for - time - points ] ) , which coincides with the local maxima of the decay and fusion reactions and is a consequence of a large number of reactions with secondary particles and the clearer temporal separation of processes involving the reactions between nucleons and the reactions involving secondary particles .",
    "naturally , we come to the prediction concerning higher energies . with increase of the collision energy , the total frequency of hadron reactions",
    "will be well separated into two parts : 1 ) starting from the beginning of a nucleus - nucleus collision , we can recognize the first stage that is due to nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the maximum of the frequency of these collisions at @xmath29 occurs , when the centers of the colliding nuclei coincide with each other , and this time moment can be estimated as @xmath30 ; 2 ) the second stage of evolution is mainly attributed to the reactions involving secondary particles .",
    "the maximum of the total frequency of hadron reactions @xmath31 is mainly determined by the maxima of the decay and fusion reaction frequencies , and the total duration of the second stage gradually increases with collision energy .    at later times after @xmath32 ,",
    "the reaction frequency goes down , which results in the division of a fireball into two spatial parts at the time moment @xmath33 and in the further breakup . the fireball division time is defined as the minimum value of time on the space - like hypersurface , which bounds the region of the cold fireball ( blue area ) from above , i.e. , @xmath34 ( see figs . [",
    "fig : zor - ags]-[fig : zor - sps ] ) .",
    "we note that the time moment @xmath35 depends weakly on the collision energy ( see table [ tab : for - time - points ] ) .",
    "it is seen that , after the time moment @xmath35 , the rates of elastic and inelastic reactions vanish . in other words ,",
    "the system behavior is determined since this moment mainly by the individual properties of particles ( basically , by resonances ) .",
    "that is why , in spite of the sufficient difference of collision energies of the experiments under consideration , the times @xmath36 are approximately the same ( see table [ tab : for - time - points ] ) . for this reason , the longitudinal size of the fireballs @xmath37 at the time moment of division into two separate parts , @xmath38 ,",
    "are approximately the same and equal to @xmath39 [ @xmath40 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) , see figs .",
    "[ fig : zor - ags]-[fig : zor - sps ] ] .",
    "this fact can explain the weak dependence of the pion interferometric radius @xmath41 on the beam energy @xcite because @xmath42 .",
    "so , it can be claimed that the fireball achieves its maximum longitudinal size as one spatial object at the time moment @xmath38 , when it is divided into two different spatial parts .",
    "different parameters such as the energy density , particle density , mean free path , etc .",
    ", can be used to analyze the fireball evolution .",
    "our approach allows one to investigate the spatial and temporal structures of the hadron system created in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions in terms of hadronic reactions that occur in the system . in other words ,",
    "the fireball is identified as a system of interacting hadrons .",
    "the proposed algorithm gives possibility to separate , with a given accuracy , the space - time region , where the most intense hadron reactions take place , i.e. we give the method to see a reaction zone in the 3d representation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zor - trz ] ) and in different projections .    in the present microscopic study",
    ", we separate a fireball into the following regions , which characterize its evolution ( see figs .  [ fig : zor - ags]-[fig : zor - sps ] ) : ( 1 ) a fireball region , where 60% of all inelastic hadronic reactions have occurred ( yellow area ) , ( 2 ) a fireball region , where 80% of all inelastic hadronic reactions have occurred ( yellow plus dark - red area ) , ( 3 ) a hot fireball region , where 99% of all inelastic hadronic reactions have occurred ( yellow plus dark - red plus red area ) , ( 4 ) a cold fireball region ( blue area ) , which together with the hot fireball contains 99% of all hadronic reactions @xmath18 .",
    "the last region ( blue area in figs .",
    "[ fig : zor - ags]-[fig : zor - sps ] ) contains the hadron - resonance gas , and the reactions in this region are mainly presented by decays of resonances if we consider times @xmath43 , see figs .",
    "[ fig : for - ags]-[fig : for - sps ] .",
    "the study of hadron reaction zones allows one to analyze the freeze - out process in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "indeed , in the literature , the sharp freeze - out hypersurface is usually defined with the help of some parameter @xmath44 which takes the critical value @xmath45 on the hypersurface , i.e. the equation for that hypersurface reads as @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , this quantity can be chosen as particle density @xmath2 @xcite , energy density @xmath3 @xcite , temperature @xmath4 @xcite , etc .",
    "moreover , the `` classical '' definition of sharp kinetic freeze - out assumes the cooper  frye picture @xcite : a radiation of free particles or the freeze out process takes place within a thin layer determined by a freeze - out hypersurface ; this approach is usually used to describe transition from the fluid dynamical stage of heavy - ion collision to the stage of dilute hadron gas .",
    "that is why , the initial value problem for the radiation of free hadrons is formulated with the use of the space - like piece of the hypersurface , whereas the boundary conditions are formulated exploiting the time - like part of the hypersurface .",
    "thus , the knowledge of the freeze - out hypersurface is important for estimation of the spectrum of secondary particles , for instance pions . on the other hand ,",
    "if we determine the reaction zone as that containing , for example , 99% of all reactions , then we can claim that the sharp kinetic freeze - out hypersurface should be definitely inside this zone ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : zor - ags]-[fig : zor - sps ] ) . indeed , as was found in @xcite the pion freeze - out hypersurface which is calculated from equation @xmath47 , where @xmath48  @xmath49 , approximately coincide with the hypersurface which bounds reaction zone that contains 80% of all inelastic hadronic reactions .",
    "( here the value of @xmath50 is chosen from the condition that the freeze - out size of the pion system is to be adequate to known hbt radius . )    assuming that the chemical freeze - out occurs , when the inelastic reactions are completed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we can also claim that the chemical freeze - out hypersurface should be inside the reaction zone , which contains 99% of all inelastic reactions .    by studying the time dependence of the reaction frequency for different reaction types ,",
    "we conclude that the total reaction rate is dominated by elastic and inelastic hadron collisions at the early stage , whereas the individual properties of particles ( basically , resonances ) and reactions involving secondary particles determine the behavior of the system at later stages .",
    "these two stages become well separated with increase of collision energy .",
    "the first stage is characterized by the fireball formation time @xmath51 which is defined as the time of the full overlap of two nuclei and thus it is determined by collision energy [ eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) ] . with increase of collision energy",
    "this time moment is a good estimation of the time moment @xmath52 , which is a maximum of nucleon - nucleon reaction frequency .",
    "the second stage is attributed mainly to decay and fusion reactions which are most intense at time moment @xmath53 ( see table  [ tab : for - time - points ] ) , and the total duration of this stage increases with collision energy .",
    "hence , the features of the second stage are mainly determined by the individual properties of secondary particles .",
    "another specific time point in the evolution of a hadron fireball is the fireball division time @xmath35 , which corresponds to the separation of the fireball into two different spatial parts and depends weakly on the collision energy ( see the last column in table  [ tab : trz ] ) .",
