    ". then we have @xmath40    the sum on the right - hand side counts for each pair in the matching the number of integers that are between the two members of the pair .",
    "but each such interior point of a given pair @xmath41 has to be either a member of a pair that crosses @xmath41 or that stays inside @xmath41 and is therefore involved in exactly one set of crossing pairs or nesting pairs .",
    "conversely , each set of crossing pairs @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath42 is counted twice in the sum , once for the point @xmath43 inside the pair @xmath30 and once for the point @xmath44 inside the pair @xmath31 .    and each set of nesting pairs @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath45 is also counted twice in the sum , for the points @xmath43 and @xmath46 inside the pair @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , dividing by two gives exactly the weight @xmath47 .",

    "the superposition contains cycles and two paths starting and ending at @xmath59 .",
    "note that the lengths of the two paths always have the same parity because the lengths of the cycles are necessarily even .    for a path running from @xmath60 and @xmath44",

    "if the length of each path is odd , we can simply add the edges @xmath30 to the matching that does not yet contain @xmath60 and @xmath44 .",

    ", the two paths in the superpositions are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , so the additional edges @xmath64 and @xmath65 are added to @xmath58 and we get the two matchings @xmath66 and @xmath67    however , if the length of each path is even , then we add an additional dummy vertex @xmath68 for each edge @xmath30 and we add the edges @xmath69 to the matchings that does not yet contain @xmath60 and we add the edges @xmath70 to the matching that does not yet contain @xmath44 .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : bijright ] for an example . )    _ step 2 : flip the cycle containing 1 _    with the additional edges , we have two perfect matchings and the superposition is a set of cycles .",
    "now , we choose the cycle that contains 1 .    in our example ,",
    "this is the cycle @xmath71 ( see the red cycle in the third image in figure  [ fig : bij ] ) .    in this cycle",
    "only , we change the roles of the two matchings .",
    "this corresponds to a reflection with respect to the horizontal axis in the graphical representation ( see the fourth image in figure  [ fig : bij ] ) .",
    "note that the two additional edges are in different cycles by construction , so the additional edge containing 1 is moved from the matching @xmath72 to the matching @xmath28 , but not the other .",
    "_ step 3 : remove the additional edges and switch the two perfect matchings _",
    "now , we can remove the additional edges again , switch the two matchings and find two new matchings @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "if a new vertex was added in step 1 , this vertex is now removed along with the additional edges .    in our example , this gives @xmath75 and @xmath76    * claim 1 : @xmath50 is an involution .",
    "* since the cycle containing 1 remains the cycle containing 1 , this just means that we repeat the same reflection twice if we apply @xmath50 twice .",
    "* claim 2 : switching the two perfect matchings preserves the weight * each term in the product of two generalized pfaffians is of the form @xmath77 , so interchanging the two matchings does not change the product .    *",
    "claim 3 : reflecting a cycle preserves the weight *    the number of crossings corresponds exactly to the intersections of arcs in the graphical representation .",
    "it is easy to see that two circles intersect an even number of times because a circles has to enter and leave the interior of the other circle the same number of times .    since reflecting",
    "does not change the number of crossings of a cycle with itself , we already see that the parity of the number of crossings is conserved , so @xmath78 does not change .",
    "we have already seen in lemma  [ lem : weightarc ] that the sum @xmath47 only depends on the number of interior points of an arc .",
    "since the reflection does not change the total set of arcs , the weight @xmath79 remains unchanged .",
    "note that in some cases , adding the two edges will create edges that share a point ( see figure  [ fig : bijrightcross ] for an example ) .",
    "but the arguments in lemma  [ lem : weightarc ] remain true if we count nested arcs that share a point as half a nesting .    adding and removing",
    "the two edges will change the weight in the way that will make the two terms cancel .",
    "for this final part , we have to check the six possible cases for the partial matchings and additional edges that the terms in equation   cancel .    in all pictures ,",
    "the dashed lines are the additional edges and the dotted ( red ) lines are the lines of the cycle containing 1 .    _",

    "any crossing or nesting of a pair not involving @xmath131 with the pair @xmath132 is also a crossing or nesting with the pair @xmath133 .",
    "this shows that the only affected crossings or nestings are the ones between @xmath132 and @xmath134 .",
    "but in this case , we will just replace one crossing by a matching or vice versa .",
    "therefore , the product of @xmath135 s and @xmath136 s and the sum @xmath137 is clearly invariant , while the number of crossings changes by one which reverses the sign as desired .",
    "a vandermonde  type identity for the pfaffian is as follows : @xmath138 we have not found a generalization of this formula for our @xmath0-pfaffian , but we present the following theorem , which generalizes a special case of this identity .

    "the identity becomes @xmath152 .",
    "for @xmath153 , the identity becomes @xmath154 which is trivial to check ( and contains an instance of the identity @xmath155 that we will use again below ) .",
