    "recently , some topological insulators ( ti ) are observed experimentally and investigated theoretically @xcite .",
    "a ti is an insulator in bulk but a robust conducting in edge even in presence of deformation or strong disorder _",
    "i.e. _ it is gapless only in surface . so it can carry charge current on its surface even in the absence of magnetic field",
    "this state of condensed matter is due to spin - orbit coupling and protected by origin of time - reversal symmetry @xcite . for two - dimensional ti",
    "we have helical modes ( the spin orientation of surface electrons are perpendicular to momentum direction ) at the edges @xcite , similar to quantum hall systems .",
    "this property is reason for some interesting physical properties of the system@xcite . for three - dimensional ti",
    ", strong ( weak ) ti is defined for odd ( even ) number of chiral dirac fermions on surface@xcite . in graphene",
    ", there are four dirac cones in momentum space @xcite , but the number of dirac cones in ti s edge are odd .",
    "so there are good unconventional properties such as fractional quantum hall effect , @xmath1 berry s phases and immunity to anderson localization due to odd spin - dirac on the surface@xcite . on the other hand , studying of transport properties",
    "is useful to understand the macroscopic and applicatory properties .",
    "some attractive physical properties are seen when ti is on proximity of ferromagnet or superconductor@xcite .",
    "also the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect has attracted much interest because of crucial applications in spintronics @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate tmr and transport properties of the dirac fermions on the surface of topological insulator for f@xmath0n@xmath0f and f@xmath0b@xmath0f junctions within the clean limit and low temperature regime .",
    "we assume that the used topological insulator is made of @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the advantage of the mentioned alloys is their single dirac cone in berillouin zone in which two dimensional dirac equation govern the dirac fermions on surface of the topological insulator@xcite . due to the exchange coupling",
    ", the ferromagnetism can be induced on the surface of topological insulator when a ferromagnetic layer is deposited on top of it@xcite .",
    "we use two dimensional dirac hamiltonian and derive wave functions in all regions . using boundary conditions we obtain analytical expressions for reflection and transmission probabilities . using the obtained reflection and transmission probabilities",
    ", we calculate electronic conductance of the two mentioned systems when the magnetization of ferromagnetic layers are parallel and antiparallel . to investigate properties of f@xmath0b@xmath0f junctions we use the thin barrier approximation .",
    "the used barrier can be made by applying a transverse voltage or doping@xcite .",
    "the main concern is to investigate the magnetoresistance of the mentioned systems and their differences .",
    "on the surface of topological insulator dirac fermions are governed by two dimensional dirac hamiltonian that is given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is vector of pauli matrices in spin space and i is identity matrix . also , @xmath6 is fermi velocity and @xmath7 is chemical potential .",
    "when a ferromagnetic electrode with magnetization * m * is deposited on surface of the ti , due to the proximity of ti and ferromagnetism , an additional term appear into eq.([dirac hamiltonian ] ) as follow@xcite : @xmath8 we consider an f@xmath0n@xmath0f junction in which thickness of normal region is @xmath9 .",
    "we assume the ti is located in @xmath10-plane and two ferromagnetic electrodes is deposited on ti such that @xmath11 in which + (  ) refers to parallel ( antiparallel ) in magnetization alignment of electrodes ( see fig . [ model ] ) . here",

    "the oscillatory behavior of both conductances are results of coherent interference of the dirac fermions at two interfaces . by using the conductances of parallel and antiparallel magnetization",
    ", one can calculate the magnetoresistance of the system which is defined as @xmath52 .",
    "this quantity may have many interesting and important applications in spintronic industry , in similarity with the ref .",
    "the plotted magnetoresistance as a function of @xmath53 is shown in fig.[[i]mr - kfl ] which shows oscillatory behavior for all of the gate voltages as we expected .",

    "although for small values of @xmath34 the magnetoresistance oscillates , the quantity for large values of @xmath34 , shows a smooth behavior .",
    "now we proceed to present an investigation of the fi / bi / fi junction .",
    "now we focus our attention to f@xmath0b@xmath0f junctions . for producing such structures one can apply a transverse gate voltage into the normal region and",
    "make it as a barrier for moving dirac fermions from left ferromagnet electrode to interface ( see fig.[model ] , part ( b ) ) . by applying the barrier voltage ,",
    "another additional term added to the dirac hamiltonian eq .",

    "the above obtained analytical expressions for the transition probabilities of parallel and antiparallel structures are other results of the present paper . as seen in eq .",
    "( [ [ ii]t - p ] ) , for an incidental particle with normal direction to the interface , the transmission probability is equal to unity .",
    "this situation is similar to the klein tunneling in quantum relativistic theory @xcite . to calculate the conductance of the mentioned parallel and antiparallel structure within the thin barrier regime",
    ", one should use the obtained transmission probabilities ( eqs.[[ii]t - ap],[[ii]t - p ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ conductance ] ) .",
    "the plotted conductances for both parallel and antiparallel magnetization are shown in fig.[[ii]gp - gap - xi ] as a function of the barrier strength @xmath67 .",
    "changing the gate voltage does nt make any changes in the positions of the extremum in conductances of parallel and antiparallel magnetization .",
    "the maximum of parallel conductance has @xmath68 phase difference with respect to antiparallel case . unlike damping oscillatory behavior of mr versus length of the normal region @xmath69 in f@xmath0n@xmath0f case ( see fig.[[i]mr - kfl ] ) , here the oscillatory behavior of the conductance leads to harmonic oscillations in mr , as shown in fig.[[ii]mr - xi ] .",
    "we plotted the magnetoresistance for this set up as a function of @xmath34 , as shown in fig.[[[ii]mr - mc ] , which approximately shows linear behavior .",
    "this linear manner in magnetoresistance for f@xmath0b@xmath0f junction seems to be more applicatory than the discussed behavior of magnetoresistance in f@xmath0n@xmath0f junctions . by tuning the gate voltage and exchange coupling due to the ferromagnetic electrodes",
    ", we can access to an arbitrary value in magnetoresistance which is useful in spintronics .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the electronic transport properties of topological insulator - based ferromagnetic / normal / ferromagnetic ( f@xmath0n@xmath0f ) and topological insulator - based ferromagnetic / barrier / ferromagnetic f@xmath0b@xmath0f junctions on the surface of topological insulator in low temperature and clean regimes .",
    "we assumed the two magnetizations are in - plane and deposited on the surface of topological insulator .",
    "we have derived analytical expressions for transmission probabilities of two different magnetization directions , parallel and antiparallel for f@xmath0n@xmath0f and f@xmath0b@xmath0f junctions . to investigate electronic properties of the f@xmath0b@xmath0f junction , in our calculations we assumed that @xmath70 and @xmath71 simultaneously .",
    "this approximation is well known as thin barrier approximation . using the derived transition probabilities , conductances and magnetoresistances of the systems",
    "were calculated .",
    "we have found that the very important quantity of such junctions ( magnetoresistance ) shows different behavior by increasing the magnetization strength of ferromagnetic region for f@xmath0n@xmath0f and f@xmath0b@xmath0f junctions .",
    "although magnetoresistance of the two junctions can be tuned from values near @xmath72 up to @xmath73 , magnetoresistance for f@xmath0n@xmath0f junctions shows oscillatory behavior vs. @xmath74 the magnetization strength , variation of the quantity vs. @xmath74 for f@xmath0b@xmath0f junctions behave like a very smooth enhancement .",
