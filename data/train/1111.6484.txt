    "there is a great deal of variety in the observed optical and infrared light curves of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows .",
    "most exhibit some form of power - law decay as predicted by a model with synchrotron emission from the forward shock of ejecta ploughing into an external medium @xcite .",
    "however afterglow light curves often display rises , flares , breaks , and other behaviour that require extensions to this simple picture .",

    "@xcite find that before about 500  s light curves can either rise or decay from the first observation , but after about 500  s a significant fraction of afterglows decay with a power law .",
    "in general the only significant temporal evolution after this time is one or more breaks in the power - law decay .",
    "there are , however , several grbs that have had optical afterglows that exhibit significant rebrightening or flaring after about 500  s. some examples are grb  970508 , which brightened by about one magnitude after about one day @xcite , grb  060614 , which peaked at about six hours @xcite , and grb  100418a , which peaked at about 14 hours @xcite .",
    "one problem with studying unusual afterglows is that the observation density is often not great enough to resolve rapid changes in the optical properties of afterglows .",

    "_ swift _ was unable to slew immediately to this burst due to an earth limb constraint , so the first _ swift _ narrow - field observations did not begin until approximately 45 minutes after the bat trigger .",

    "the australia compact telescope array observed grb  081029 approximately one month after the burst at 4.800 and 4.928 ghz , but did not detect the afterglow . their merged data at 4.800 and 4.928  ghz yielded a radio flux density , at the afterglow position , of @xmath9  mjy per beam @xcite .",
    "a redshift of @xmath10 was measured from several absorption features by the vlt / uves @xcite and was confirmed by gemini - south / gmos @xcite . the vlt / uves spectrum is presented in   [ section : spectrum ] .",
    "the gmos spectrum shows evidence for a damped lyman - alpha system as well as several metal absorption features in the host galaxy .",
    "grb  081029 was unusual even amongst the grbs with unusual optical light curves .",
    "the initial light curve decayed in the normal way , but there was a sudden increase in flux at about 3000  s @xcite that can not be explained using the convention afterglow model . in this paper",
    "we present space- and ground - based gamma - ray , x - ray , ultraviolet , optical , and near - infrared observations of grb  081029 .",
    "we will propose that the x - ray , optical , and infrared data suggest that the afterglow of grb  081029 can broadly be explained by the collision of a fast - moving ejecta shell with a slower shell within a two - component jet .",

    "the energy fluence in the 15150 kev band is @xmath16 erg  @xmath14 .",
    "the time - average spectrum is well fitted by a simple power law with the photon index of @xmath17 .",
    "because of the weak , smooth light curve of the prompt emission , grb  081029 satisfies the bat possible high-@xmath18 criteria @xcite .",

    "the bat parameters are from the bat1 catalogue @xcite .",
    "as seen in the figure , grb  081029 has a lower peak flux and fluence than the higher redshift bursts such as grb  050904 , grb  060510b , and grb  050814 .",
    "we also note that some very faint grbs , such as grb  071122 and grb  080604 occurred at low redshifts .",
    "therefore , the weakness and the smoothness of the grb  081029 hard x - ray light curve in the prompt emission might be more related to the central engine of the burst rather than the cosmological redshift effect .",
    "the @xcite test gives a reasonable indication that a burst may be at high redshifts but the false negatives  such as grb  080913a , grb  090423 , grb  090429b , and grb  090429b @xcite , which were at high redshift but did not satisfy the criteria  mean that the test should be used with extreme caution .",

    "the initial x - ray light curve shows some evidence for flaring between approximately 2500 and 5000  s after the bat trigger .",
    "the sawtooth behaviour of the x - ray emission during this period is consistent with flares with @xmath30 .",
    "it is possible that the x - ray photons that we see at this time are due to flaring on top of a power law decay .",
    "the lack of x - ray data before 2000  s could be causing us to miss the rise of the flare and thus give the impression that the x - ray photons seen between 2000  s and 5000  s are due solely to the plateau phase of the x - ray light curve .",
    "the x - ray spectrum can be fit by an absorbed power law with a photon index @xmath31 , corresponding to @xmath32 .",

    "this deviation is comparable to the variability seen in the early ( @xmath155  s ) rotse and rem data .    between about 3000 and 5000  s the x - ray light curve has a decay index of @xmath156 . the optical and infrared light curves at this time , however , rise rapidly , as is clearly seen in the grond data @xcite .",

    "the break seen at 940  s in the early grond light curves has a magnitude of @xmath162 and is achromatic .",
    "the post - break decay index is too small for the change in decay index to be due to a jet break , and the achromatic nature of the break argues against it being due to the passage of the cooling break through the optical bands . the break can be explained by energy injection turning off at 940  s. if we assume a constant density interstellar medium , and that the cooling break is above the optical bands , then having @xmath163 during energy injection and @xmath164 after energy injection stops implies an energy injection index of @xmath165 where @xmath166 and an electron distribution index of @xmath167 where @xmath168 @xcite . using these values",

    "the only scenario that gives a spectral index that is roughly consistent with the observed @xmath173 is a constant density environment with the cooling break above the x - ray band between 900  s and 3000  s.    the energy injection scenario can explain the early - time behaviour of the optical and infrared light curves , but it can not explain the rebrightening seen at 3000  s. we need some other mechanism to do this .",

    "the afterglow is characterized by a rebrightening in the optical and infrared bands with a simultaneous flattening in the x - ray band .",
    "this implies that a new mechanism was contributing to the flux in the optical regime starting at about 3000  s. in the two - component jet model , the early afterglow emission ( @xmath174  s ) was produced by the narrow , fast component while the late rebrightening was attributed to the emergence of the radiation powered by the wider , slower component .    in our fit",
    "the deceleration time for the wide component occurs earlier than 3000s , and we find that the synchrotron frequency of the wide jet component of the afterglow is between the x - ray and optical bands ( i.e. , @xmath175 ) for @xmath176  s. the passage of the wide jet s synchrotron break through the optical band can not reproduce the rapid rise that is seen in the optical and infrared photometry at about 3000 s , suggesting that there is another process at work that contributes to the sudden increase in the flux . further ,  @xcite find that optical flux rises as @xmath177 during this time .",

    "we tried varying the amount of extinction when fitting our models and found that the observed seds can be made to weakly agree with the model if there is extinction in the host galaxy along the line of sight to the burst .",
    "this is consistent with the constraints on the extinction ( @xmath199  mag in the host galaxy ) from the x - ray data alone (   [ section : xrt_data ] ) but inconsistent with the stronger constraint on the host extinction ( @xmath200  mag ) found by combining the x - ray , optical , and infrared data (   [ section : sed ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figure : model ] the two - component jet model can reproduce the x - ray and some of the optical / infrared data reasonably well .",

    "both of these predictions are inconsistent with the data .",
    "the two - component jet model can explain the observed light curves of the afterglow , but not the spectral behaviour .",
    "further , the two - component jet model has trouble handling the rapid rise in the flux seen at @xmath1543000  s.      @xcite have proposed that collisions between ejecta shells can produce flares in the optical light curve . in their scenario two shells are ejected by the central engine .",
    "the first shell has a lower lorentz factor than the second shell , so the second shell will eventually catch up with the first .",
    "the first shell sweeps up a uniform interstellar medium and decelerates .",
    "the second shell has a higher lorentz factor and overtakes the first shell .",

    "@xcite find that the collision between two shells of material with different lorentz factors can produce an optical flare with @xmath206 .",
    "this is approximately consistent with the grond data for the rebrightening episode .",
    "the simulations of @xcite suggest that the magnitude of the flare , relative to the underlying synchrotron light curve , depends on the lorentz factor and the isotropic energy .",
    "they find typical values for the increase in the flux ( @xmath207 ) resulting from the collision of @xmath2085 for typical grb values of @xmath209 and @xmath205 .",
    "this is consistent with what is seen during the rebrightening of grb  081029 .",
    "figures  4  and  5 of @xcite show predicted optical light curves produced by colliding ejecta shells for four sets of lorentz factors and isotropic energies .",
    "all four cases result in light curves that exhibit flares that have shapes and intensities that are similar to the rebrightening seen in grb  081029 .",
    "the simulations assume @xmath210 for the first shell , which results in the onset of a flare at @xmath211  s in the rest frame .",
    "our data suggest that the grb  081029 s flare started at @xmath212  s in the observer s frame ( @xmath213  s in grb  081029 s rest frame ) .",
    "however , the time of the collision will depend on the time that the second ( faster ) shell was ejected relative to the first ( slower ) shell , and on the distance of the first shell from the central engine ( and the first shell s lorentz factor ) .",
    "detailed simulations will be needed to test this scenario and determine the physical properties of the ejecta .",
    "in general we find that by themselves neither a one - component jet nor continuous energy injection from the central engine can explain the observed light curves and sed of the x - ray , optical , and infrared afterglows of grb  081029 .",
    "a two - component jet model , similar to what is seen in some other grb afterglows , does provide a reasonable fit to the light curves , but the lorentz factor of the fast , narrow jet is less than expected given that the peak time of the light curve is earlier than 89  s in the observer s frame .",
    "further , the two - component jet model is not able to reproduce the observed seds during the unusual optical activity .",
    "we find that the rise in the optical light curves of the afterglow of grb  081029 can be broadly explained by the collision of a fast - moving ejecta shell with a slower shell that has been decelerated by sweeping up a uniform interstellar medium .",
    "this scenario does not , however , address the shallow decay phase of the afterglow .",
    "the early shallow decay requires that the emission is due to a different emission component from the late - time emission .",
    "we favour the multi - component jet explanation because it does not require energy injection .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed sed ( with @xmath214 and @xmath215  mag ) and the sed that is predicted by by the two - jet model ( with @xmath216 and @xmath217  mag ) can be explained by the spectrum at @xmath218  s being dominated by emission from the flare caused by the collision between the two shells .",
    "evidence for this is that at 4000  s , during the onset of the flare , the sed had @xmath219 , which suggests a transition between the intrinsic sed of the narrow jet and the sed of the emission from the collision .",
    "if this is the case there is no need to invoke extinction to explain the difference between the observed and predicted spectral decay indices .",
    "this leads to a picture where grb  081029 had a two - component jet and a collision between two ejecta shells at about 3000  s. at this time the afterglow is making a transition from being dominated by the narrow jet to being dominated by the wide jet , so it is not possible to tell if the collision between the two ejecta shells occurred in the narrow or wide jet .",
    "the nature of grb afterglows has been a matter of much debate over the past decade .",
    "there is a general agreement that they are the result of a combination of a forward shock due to a relativistic jet moving into the circumstellar medium surrounding the burst and a reverse shock that propagates back into the jet .",
    "however , the details of how these shocks affect their environment , the role of magnetic fields , and the structure of the jets are the subject of much research .",
    "several grbs have had afterglows that are difficult or impossible to explain using a single , uniform jet .",
    "a multi - component jet structure has been postulated to explain unusual behaviour in the light curves of some grbs .",
    "an example of a multi - component jet is given by @xcite , who invoked a two - component jet to explain radio observations of the long  soft burst grb  030329 .",
    "@xcite found that a two - component jet explained grb  050802 s afterglow , and @xcite found that a two - component jet could explain the lack of a jet break in the light curves of xrf  050416a .",
    "@xcite found that the afterglow emission from the `` naked - eye burst '' grb  080319b is best explained using a two - component jet .",
    "a multi - component jet can also explain the afterglow of the short  hard burst grb  051221a @xcite .",
    "however , the physical parameters of multi - component jets vary considerably from one grb to another , so there does not appear to be a universal jet structure .",
    "multi - component or structured jets are predicted by simulations of the relativistic outflow from grbs .",
    "@xcite found that the bulk lorenz factor decreases as one moves away from the axis of the jet resulting in a jet with a fast inner core surrounded by a slower outer envelope .",
    "simulations of outflows from accretion discs about collapsed massive stars show that multi - component jets can form with the outer jet carrying far more energy than the inner jet @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the inner and outer jet will have different energies and different bulk lorentz factors .",
    "the interaction of each jet with the circumburst medium will produce separate afterglow emission components , which can result in complex light curves @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to create late - time activity in the central engine of a grb that would result in multiple ejecta events .",
    "@xcite suggest that the fragmentation of a rapidly - rotating stellar core could result in multiple accretion events onto the newly - formed compact object .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the fragmentation of an accretion disc that is undergoing viscous evolution can result in an accretion disc that results in highly variable accretion onto the central compact object .",
    "each accretion event would restart the central engine resulting in new shells being ejected .",
    "each accretion event would be independent , so the initial lorentz factors of the ejecta could vary considerably leading to collisions between shells from different events .    there is evidence for colliding shells in the optical light curves of a few grbs .",
    "the afterglow of grb  081029 has an optical light curve that is similar to that of grb  060206 @xcite , and grb 970508 @xcite exhibited a late - time flare similar to what is expected from colliding shells .",
    "after ten years such flares have only been observed in a handful of grb afterglows , which suggests that discrete late - time accretion events may be fairly uncommon in grbs .    a combination of the colliding shell scenario and a multi - component jet can reproduce the broad features of the light curves , but detailed modelling will be needed to determine the physical parameters governing this afterglow .",
    "several grb afterglows have shown evidence for multi - component jets , and there is evidence that some grbs undergo multiple accretion events that result in late - time impulsive energy injection into the afterglow .",
    "grb afterglows appear to be complex phenomena that require detailed modelling to be fully understood .",
    "we detect both hydrogen absorbing features ( ly@xmath147 and ly@xmath220 ) and several metallic transitions in the spectrum of the optical afterglow .",
    "the latter belong both to neutral elements ( ( @xmath1241039 ) and ( @xmath1241302 ) ) , low ionization species ( ( @xmath1241334 ) , ( @xmath1241250 ) , ( @xmath1241253 ) , and ( @xmath1241259 ) , ( @xmath1241264 ) , ( @xmath1241304 ) , and ( @xmath1241526 ) , ( @xmath1241608 ) , ( @xmath1241670 ) , ( 1854 ) ) and high ionization species ( ( @xmath1241238 ) and ( @xmath1241242 ) , ( @xmath1241393 ) and ( @xmath1241402 ) , ( @xmath1241548 ) and ( @xmath1241550 ) , ( @xmath1241031 ) and ( @xmath1241037 ) ) .",
    "in addition to these features , lines from several fine structure levels of ( @xmath1241334 ) , ( @xmath1241304 ) and ( @xmath1241306 ) , ( @xmath1241264 ) , ( @xmath1241309 ) , and ( @xmath1241533 ) , and ( @xmath1241618 ) , ( @xmath1241621 ) , ( @xmath1241631 ) , and ( @xmath1241636 ) are detected .",
    "these features are excited by the ultraviolet flux from the grb afterglow .",
    "estimates of the typical distance from a grb to absorption systems suggest distances of @xmath2211  kpc @xcite implying that all these absorption features are due to the grb  081029 host galaxy .",
    "the common redshift of these features is @xmath222 , which we take at the redshift of the host .",
    "we find no evidence for intervening metal absorption lines in our combined spectrum .",
    "grb  081029 was a long  soft grb with a redshift of @xmath223 .",
    "it had a smooth gamma - ray light curve and did not appear to have any unusual gamma - ray properties . neither the gamma - ray nor the x - ray properties of this burst showed any sign of strange behaviour .",
    "the optical and infrared light curves , on the other hand , were not typical of grb afterglows . there was a brightening in the optical and infrared light curves at about 3000  s that can not be explained as the passage of the synchrotron break through the optical , by a two - component jet model , or by continuous energy injection from the central engine . we find that the combination of the colliding shell scenario of @xcite and a two - component jet can reproduce the unusual optical light curve of this afterglow .",
    "our result is consistent with a central engine that was reactivated by a discrete , major accretion event .",
