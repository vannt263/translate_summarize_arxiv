    "<S> when one of the electron gas carries a current , the momentum transfer due to coulomb interaction leads to a small current in the other electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> recently , this current drag phenomenon has been discovered in a different system with entirely different physical mechanisms @xcite : when an electric current is injected into a pt bar deposited on a magnetic insulator yttrium - iron - garnet ( yig ) film , it is found that a small electric voltage is induced in the other pt bar , which is also deposited on the same yig film but is located several millimeters away from the current carrying pt bar . </S>",
    "<S> the authors @xcite attributed their finding to the combined effects of spin transfer torque ( stt ) @xcite and spin pumping @xcite : the spin hall @xcite current generated by the electric current in one pt layer ( pt is a known material with a large spin hall angle ) is absorbed by the fi and for a sufficiently large stt , the magnetic moment of the fi begins precessing . </S>",
    "<S> the precessing fi pumps out a spin current to the other pt layer . finally , the resulting spin current converts to an electron current due to the inverse spin hall effect @xcite .    in this letter </S>",

    "<S> the other boundary conditions at the interfaces should relate the electron spin accumulation to the non - equilibrium magnon density . within the s - d model </S>",

    "<S> the detailed derivation of @xmath90 is arranged in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> we note that takahashi et al . </S>",
    "<S> have also proposed a boundary condition at the interface @xcite which relates magnon spin current to spin accumulation ; i.e. , @xmath91 . however , such boundary condition is unable to self - consistently determine the magnon current . on the contrary , </S>",

    "<S> , we show @xmath114 as a function of the thickness of the metal layer ( nm2 ) for pt / yig / pt trilayers with several different yig layer thicknesses . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the material parameters as follows : pt layer conductivity @xmath115 , spin diffusion length @xmath116 @xmath117 and the spin hall angle @xmath118 @xcite ; magnon diffusion length @xmath119 @xmath120 and magnon relaxation time @xmath121 @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath123 decreases as the thickness of the yig layer increases due to the decay of magnon diffusion current . </S>",
    "<S> also for fixed yig layer thickness , @xmath124 reaches its maximum around @xmath125 . </S>",

    "<S> if the injected current density is @xmath127 @xmath128 , the induced voltage of a pt bar with its length @xmath129 cm would be @xmath130 mv . </S>",
    "<S> if one replaces pt with ta which has larger spin hall angle of @xmath131 @xcite , @xmath132 can be further increased by a factor of 4 , which is rather significant and easily detectable experimentally .        </S>",
    "<S> finally we comment on the relation of our calculation with the experimental measurement @xcite . in their experiments , </S>",
    "<S> when the first pt layer injects a spin current to the fi layer , the magnons propagate _ in the plane of the fi layer _ in order to reach the second pt . while there is a similar non - equilibrium magnon density buildup near the second pt layer , the _ direction _ of the magnon current and the _ gradient _ of the magnon density are in the plane of the layer . in another word </S>",
    "<S> , there is neither magnon current nor magnon density gradient in the direction perpendicular to the layer such that the second pt layer is unable to receive any spin angular momentum from the fi layer . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the nonlocal setup in the experiment @xcite is not relevant to our theory . in the conventional nonlocal metallic spin valve , however , one does observe a voltage change of the entire detection bar due to the spin accumulation ( not the spin current or gradient of the spin accumulation ) in the channel . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the induced current in the second pt bar which is related to the spin current ( or magnon density gradient ) in the direction perpendicular to the layer . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the observed current in the experiment@xcite has been attributed to the stt and spin pumping , which is several orders of magnitude smaller than what we predict in our geometry .    </S>",
