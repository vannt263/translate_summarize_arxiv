    "trees are ubiqutous structures which appear naturally in a large number of physical , chemical , biological and social phenomena , such as river networks , diffusion limited aggregation , pulmonary arteries , blood vessels and tree species , social organizations , decision structures , etc",
    ". they also play an important role in computer science ( use of registers and computer languages ) , in graph theory , and in various methods of statistical physics such as cluster expansions and renormalization group .    in spite of their apparent structural simplicity , and the large body of scientific work on trees",
    "( a sample of which is found in @xcite-@xcite , @xcite,@xcite-@xcite and references therein ) , they still offer challenges even related to the quantitative description of their topological structure . at the dawn of the science of complex networks @xcite , it is therefore rather important to have a complete understanding of all the tree structures and their properties .",
    "a tree is defined as a set of points ( vertices , nodes ) connected with line segments ( branches , or edges ) such that there are no cycles or loops ( a connected graph without cycles ) . for the simplest ( unlabeled ) rooted plane binary tree ,",
    "each vertex has exactly three connecting branches , except for one vertex which is distinguished from all the others by having only two connecting branches coined as the root ( r ) of the tree , and a certain number of vertices with a single connecting branch called the ` leaves ' .",
    "the height of the tree is defined by the maximum number of levels starting from the root ( which has height 0 ) , and it can be calculated as the maximum number of branches one has to pass to reach the root from its vertices ( since the leaves have only one branch , it means that this longest excursion must start from one of the leaves ) .",
    "the paths from the leaves to the root define a natural direction on the tree ( similarly to the river flow ) which is always towards the levels of lower height . a tree of height @xmath2 we call _ complete _ , if it has @xmath3 leaves each being a distance @xmath2 from the root .",
    "let us now mention three applications of the mathematics of trees which are directly connected to the so - called horton - strahler index of the tree , which is the subject of interest of the present paper .",
    "originally , the horton - strahler index of a binary tree was introduced in the studies of natural river networks by horton @xcite and later refined by strahler @xcite , as a way of indexing real river topologies , since river networks are topologically similar to binary trees . by definition ,",
    "a leaf has a rank of 0 ( some authors associate the value of 1 ) , and a vertex has a rank of @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the index function with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the ranks of the two connecting vertices from the level above . when @xmath8 the index is called the horton - strahler index ( hs ) .",
    "the quantity of particular interest is the hs index of the root which thus categorizes the topological complexity of the whole tree .",
    "several other quantities can be introduced in relation to the hs index .",
    "segment _ of order @xmath2 @xcite , or a _ stream _ of order @xmath2 @xcite is a _",
    "maximal _ path of branches connecting vertices of hs index @xmath2 , ending in a vertex with index @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the number of segments of order @xmath2 of a tree @xmath11 with @xmath1 leaves , and @xmath12 is the average physical length of a segment of order @xmath2 ( the average @xmath13 is taken on the tree @xmath11 ) .",
    "the _ bifurcation ratios _ @xmath14 are defined as @xmath15 , and the length ratios via @xmath16 . horton and strahler have empirically observed that for river networks both the @xmath17 and @xmath18 tend to approximate a geometric series , @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "such networks are called _ topologically self - similar _ @xcite .",
    "the notion of hs index is further refined by introducing the _ biorder _ @xmath23 of a vertex , representing the hs indices of its two children @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , and then studying the ramification matrix , with elements related to the number of vertices with a given biorder .",
    "another interesting application of the mathematics of binary trees and the hs index , is in the description of the branched structure of diffusion - limited aggregates see ref . @xcite and references therein . in this case",
    "the structures are grown on a substrate ( which can be a point or a plane ) by letting small particles diffuse towards the aggregate where they stick indefinitely at their point of first contact with the cluster .",
    "this creates complex and involved branched structures , whose topological complexity still remains a challenging problem to describe .",
    "finally , the last application we would like to mention is known as the _ word bracketing problem _ @xcite which has obvious implications in computer science .",
    "let us consider an alphabet of @xmath1 letters , @xmath24 and a word @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "a 2-bracketing of the word @xmath27 is a partition of its letters ( by keeping their order ) in groups of two units enclosed in brackets , where a unit can be a letter or a subpartition enclosed in brackets , such as @xmath28 , or @xmath29 , etc .",
    "the bracket @xmath30 between two units may be associated with a multiplicative composition law @xmath31 .",
    "for example let the alphabet @xmath32 be all the positive integers , and the composition law be the regular multiplication of numbers .",
    "then a bracketing of the multiple product @xmath27 corresponds to one particular way of calculating @xmath27 .",
    "a one - to - one correspondence can be made immediately to trees : let the letters @xmath33 of the word @xmath27 be associated with the leaves of a binary tree . to a particular bracketing of @xmath27 it corresponds a particular tree constructed by associating a lower level vertex to a bracketing @xmath30 ( one may think of the brackets as representing the branches of the tree ) . the main question is how many ways are there to calculate such a product . if one assumes that the multiplication law is neither associative nor commutative , then the problem is refered to as the catalan problem , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a number of solutions .",
    "the number of such bracketings is given by the catalan numbers , @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding set of trees ( see fig.1 for @xmath35 ) is in fact the set of rooted , unlabeled binary plane trees according to this bijection .",
    "= 5.0 in    for later reference , we mention that the generating function @xmath36 of the catalan numbers obey the equation @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , so @xmath39 the power series @xmath40 converges within a disk of radius @xmath41 .",
    "the problem of enumerating trees becomes more difficult if the composition law is commutative , which was first studied by wedderburn and etherington ( we ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the tree language , this means that two trees are considered identical if after a number of successive reflections with respect to the vertical axes passing through the vertices they can be transformed into each other and in this case they are said to be homeomorphic @xcite .",
    "for the example shown in fig .",
    "1 , there are only two such trees , since trees 1 ) , 2 ) , 4 ) and 5 ) can be transformed into each other .",
    "the trees that can not be transformed into each other are called non - homeomorphic .",
    "the set of non - homeomorphic trees is called the set of _ ambilateral _ trees , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let the number of such trees with @xmath1 leaves be denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "the generating function ( gf ) defined as @xmath43 obeys the nonlinear functional equation : @xmath44 which has extensively been studied by wedderburn @xcite .",
    "otter @xcite studying a more general counting problem where the vertices can have at most @xmath45 branches comes to the conclusion that for the ambilateral trees , if @xmath1 is large we have : @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the method developed by otter gives an iterative approach to @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "for example @xmath49 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 so that for @xmath35 one already obtains an extremely close value of @xmath53 .",
    "later , bender developed a more general approach @xcite deriving the same results .",
    "the coefficient @xmath48 in ( [ wen ] ) can also be computed : @xmath54 .",
    "the more practical application of the bracketing problem within computer science is the computation of arithmetic expressions by a computer .",
    "a general arithmetic expression involving only binary operators can simply be mapped onto a binary tree , called the syntax tree , which has as leaves the operands and the inner vertices the operators .",
    "a computer traverses this tree from the leaves towards the root and it uses registers to store the intermediate results .",
    "in general there are many ways of traversing such a tree , and the program that uses the _",
    "minimal _ number of registers is the most efficient , or optimal one .",
    "ershov has shown @xcite that the optimal code will use exactly as many registers to store the intermediate results as the hs index of the associated syntax tree .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate how the hs index is distributed on both the rooted , unlabeled , plane binary set of trees , and on the ambilateral set of binary trees .",
    "we first answer this question on the rooted , unlabeled , plane binary set , since it is simpler , but it will also provide us with a technique that can be extended to tackle the problem for the ambilateral set .",
    "for this set , the question was first answered by flajolet , raoult and vuillemin , @xcite with a method somewhat similar to the one presented here .",
    "the enumeration problem of the hs index on the ambilateral set is , however , inherently more difficult since it involves functional equations with nonlinear dependence in the argument similar to eq .",
    "( [ nlf ] ) , and therefore an explicit solution in a closed form becomes impossible to attain .",
    "the derivation of an approximant formula for the number of ambilateral trees sharing the same hs index at the root is the main result of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we present our derivation of the enumeration problem for the hs index on the unlabeled set in section ii , and then use this method of derivation from this case to develop a technique that can be used to attack the enumeration problem on the ambilateral set in the asymptotic limit , presented in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to conclusions and outlook .",
    "let us observe that the root @xmath55 of the tree has always two subtrees attached to it via the two branches , with @xmath2 and @xmath56 leaves , respectively , @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 denote the number of unlabeled trees with @xmath1 leaves that share the same hs index @xmath59 at the root .",
    "a recursion is found for this number in the light of the observation above : @xmath60 with the conventions @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "if the generating function for the variable @xmath1 is defined as @xmath64 , then it obeys : @xmath65 next we give an exact solution to ( [ recc ] ) .",
    "let us introduce the sum @xmath66 then @xmath67 , and after rearranging the terms , eq .",
    "( [ recc ] ) becomes @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "this means that @xmath70 , i.e. , : @xmath71 note that the left hand side of ( [ b ] ) remains invariant to @xmath72 which is another solution of ( [ b ] ) .",
    "however , since in case of the hs index @xmath73 , this latter solution has to be dropped .",
    "if we make @xmath74 , ( [ b ] ) simplifies to @xmath75 . which , after dividing on both sides by @xmath76 , and introducing @xmath77 , becomes : @xmath78 let us now write @xmath79 , such that @xmath80",
    ". then ( [ z ] ) becomes @xmath81 which leads to @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and which in turn is solved easily .",
    "thus , @xmath84 , so one finally obtains : @xmath85 eq .",
    "( [ ux ] ) is the exact solution to ( [ recc ] ) in the complex @xmath86 plane . on the real axis , within the radius of convergence @xmath87",
    "the above expression takes the form : @xmath88 $ ] , @xmath89 . since within the convergence disk",
    "one must have @xmath90 , we just obtained the identity ( using ( [ a ] ) ) : @xmath91 this identity can be checked to hold via more direct methods @xcite .",
    "the singularities of @xmath92 lie on the positive real axis at : @xmath93 with an additional singularity at infinity ( corresponding to @xmath94 ) .",
    "we certainly have @xmath95 . on the other hand",
    "if one simply iterates ( [ recc ] ) we obtain : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a polynomial in @xmath86 of order @xmath98 : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , ... etc .",
    "one can find an explicit form for this polynomial from the general solution ( [ ux ] ) if one invokes the identity @xcite : @xmath102 , so that ( [ pol ] ) is recovered with : @xmath103 .",
    "it is easy to show , however , that @xmath104 , so the polynomial simplifies to : @xmath105 expression valid on the whole complex @xmath86 plane . based on the explicit solution we obtained , one can give an exact form to the distribution of the hs index on the unlabeled set of trees , by inverting the generating function via : @xmath106 one can write : @xmath107 where @xmath108 . by cauchy",
