    "the nonlinear diffusion equation @xmath5 was originally introduced by j.m.burgers in @xcite ( 1939 ) as a model for hydrodynamical turbulence .",
    "burgers equation ( [ eq : difeq ] ) describes two fundamental effects characteristic of any turbulence @xcite : the nonlinear redistribution of energy over the spectrum and the action of viscosity in small scales .",
    "burgers equation was used later to describe a large class of physical systems in which the nonlinearity is fairly weak ( quadratic ) and the dispersion is negligible compared to the linear damping @xcite .",
    "the most important example of such waves are acoustical waves with finite amplitude @xcite .",
    "another class of problems , arising , e.g. , in surface growth , also leads to burgers equation @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the three dimensional form of ( [ eq : difeq ] ) has been used in cosmology to describe the formation of large scale structures of the universe at a nonlinear stage of gravitational instability (  see e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite  ) .    in the physically important case of large reynolds number ,",
    "the action of viscosity is significant only in the small regions with high gradient of the velocity field . in the limit",
    "@xmath6 , the solution of burgers equation has the following form ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coordinate of the maximum of the function @xmath9 strong interaction between coherent harmonics leads to the appearance of local self - similar structures in burgers equation . a periodic initial perturbation with zero mean velocity is transformed asymptotically into a sawtooth wave with gradient @xmath10  and with the same period @xmath11 .",
    "it is important that at this stage the amplitude @xmath12 and the energy density @xmath13 do not depend on the initial amplitude .",
    "an initial one - signed pulse with the area @xmath14 , localised at @xmath15 in the neighbourhood of the point  @xmath16 ,   also has asymptotically a universal form : it transforms into a triangular pulse with the gradient @xmath17 and increasing coordinate of the shock @xmath18 . due to the increase of the integral scale the amplitude of such a pulse @xmath19and",
    "its energy will decrease more slowly than for a periodic signal , like @xmath20 .",
    "continuous random initial fields are also transformed into sequences of regions with the same gradient @xmath21 , but with random locations of the shocks separating them . due to the multiple merging of the shocks",
    "the statistical properties of such random fields are also self - similar and may be characterised by the integral scale of the turbulence @xmath4 .",
    "the merging of the shocks leads to an increase of the integral scale @xmath4 , and because of this the energy @xmath22 of a random wave decreases more slowly than the energy of periodic signals .",
    "the type of turbulence evolution is determined by the behaviour of the large scale part of the initial energy spectrum @xmath23 @xmath24 here  @xmath25   is a function which falls off rapidly for  @xmath26 , and  @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 the law of enrgy decay strongly depends on the statistical properties of the initial field ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for the initial gaussian perturbation the integral scale @xmath29 times logarithmic correction obtains and",
    "is determined by two integral characteristics of the initial spectrum : the variances of the initial potential @xmath30 and the velocity @xmath31   @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "for @xmath32 the structure function of the initial potential increases as a power law in space .",
    "then the initial potential field is brownian , or fractional brownian motion , and some scaling may be used @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite . in this case",
    "the turbulence is also self - similar and the integral scale @xmath4 increases as @xmath33 the energy of the turbulence is derived from ( [ eq : sigmat ] ) : @xmath34    the difference between these two cases  ( @xmath1 and @xmath28 ) is connected to the process of parametric generation of low frequency component of the spectrum . for the case @xmath1 the newly generated low frequency components are relatively small and we have the conservation of large scale part of the spectrum : @xmath35 thus , the laws of turbulent decay are more complex than for simple signals , which can be attributed to multiple merging of the shocks . in @xcite a model of a regular fractal signal with decay lower than for single one - signed pulse was introduced .",
    "the initial signal @xmath31 was constructed as a sequence of one - signed pulses whose positions form a cantor set with capacity ( fractal dimension ) @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of pulses in the scale @xmath38 ,   @xmath39 .",
    "multiple merging makes the decay of the wave slower and the general behaviour of the energy decay may be approximated by the power law with the exponent in ( [ eq : sigmap ] ) : @xmath40 the evolution proves to be self - similar in successive time periods @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "this shows log - periodical self - similarity of the field evolution .",
    "linear and non - linear decay of fractal and spiral fields given by the sequences of regular pulses was also investigated in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the power law ( [ eq : sigmap ] ) with the exponent given by the formula ( [ eq : pf ] ) holds also true for homogeneous fractal pulse signal with capacity @xmath44 .",
    "another model of a multiscale signal , which has the same general behaviour on the external scale @xmath4 ( [ eq : lt ] ) , and energy of the burgers turbulence , was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was assumed therein that the initial signal is a discrete set of modes - the spatial harmonics @xmath45 with wavenumbers @xmath46 and amplitudes @xmath47 given in terms of a parameter @xmath48 by @xmath49 amplitudes @xmath47 and the scaling exponent @xmath50 are chosen from the condition that the mean energy of harmonics in the interval @xmath51 be identical to that corresponding to the spectral density ( [ eq : no4 ] ) :  @xmath52 .  for @xmath53 and @xmath54 the harmonics",
    "are spread over the spatial spectrum and accumulate at the point @xmath55 with decreasing amplitude . the main approach in this model was that the energy of the wave is the sum of energies of independent modes .",
    "the approach is nontrivial , but nevertheless leads to the same laws of the integral scale @xmath4 ( [ eq : lt ] ) and the energy decay ( [ eq : sigmap ] ) as in the case of continuous spectrum ( [ eq : no4 ] ) .",
    "let us point out that representation of the field given by the formula ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) is similar to shell models , which were introduced as useful models addressing the problem of analogous scaling in fully developed turbulence ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and references in there ) .",
    "in present paper we consider the evolution of a regular signal whose behaviour in general is similar to the evolution of the burgers turbulence with continuous spectrum ( [ eq : no4 ] )",
    ". the main difference , as compared to the model discussed above , is that we construct the exact solution of burgers equation using as an initial mode the `` reverse '' sawtooth wave .",
    "the frequency ratio in our model is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is an integer and @xmath58 .",
    "these perturbation are similar to the well known weierstrass and weierstrass - mandelbrot fractal functions ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    for the analysis of burgers equation it is convenient to use a mechanical interpretation .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the solution of burgers equation and the dynamic of a gas of inelastically interacting particles @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us take a one - dimensional particle flux with a contact interaction : as long as the particles do not run into each other they move with constant velocity . in the collision",
    "they stick together , forming a delta - function singularity in the matter density .",
    "this leads to the appearance of gas of two species : a hydrodynamical flux of the `` light '' initial particles , and a gas of `` heavy '' particles arising in the adhesion process of light particles .",
    "the evolution of the particle velocity field will be described by the solution of burgers equation if we assume that the initial density of the light particles is @xmath59 , the velocity of particles is equal to the initial velocity in ( [ eq : difeq ] ) , and that the collision of the particles conserve their mass and momentum .",
    "this analogy permits construction of a very fast ( linear time ) algorithm of solution of burgers equation @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "for the initial reverse sawtooth wave , all the matter turns into heavy particles at the same moment of time .",
    "thus , after this time the evolution of the burgers turbulence is fully determined by the motion of heavy particles , whose positions are positions of shocks , and masses are equal to @xmath60 , where @xmath61 are the amplitudes of the shocks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider the evolution and interaction of `` reverse '' sawtooth modes . in section 3",
    "we consider the interaction of small scale mode with large scale structures . in section 4",
    "we investigate the properties of the sawtooth weierstrass - mandelbrot fractal function . in section 5",
    "we show that deterministic model has logarithmic periodic self - similarity .",
    "we also discuss here the multi - dimensional generalization of this model .",
    "section 5 presents concluding remarks .",
    "let us introduce the @xmath62th `` reverse '' saw tooth mode as @xmath63 here @xmath64 are amplitude and wavenumber of the mode , @xmath65 is its phase .",
    "the function @xmath66 is @xmath67 periodic function , given on its first period by the following expression @xmath68 the set of `` reverse sawtooth '' functions is not orthogonal , but nevertheless we will introduce a set of modes satisfying equation ( [ kpapa0 ] ) , whose wavenumbers and amplitudes satisfy the same relations as the sinusoidal modes of @xcite , i.e. relation ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) .",
    "we introduce the term `` reverse sawtooth '' because this signal is a sawtooth with teeth facing to the right , but the term `` sawtooth '' by itself is widely used in burgers turbulence literature to refer to the late stage of the evolution of the wave profile a sequence of sawteeth with _ positive _ slope @xmath69 .",
    "the solution of burgers equation with a linear velocity profile @xmath70 is well - known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath71 the value @xmath72 has the dimension of time , and for @xmath73 , at the finite time @xmath74 the gradient  @xmath75   becames infinite . for @xmath76",
    "the gradient becomes equal to @xmath77 , independent of the value of @xmath78 at times @xmath79 .",
    "thus , we have from ( [ kpapa0 ] ) , ( [ eq:2.1]),([eq:2.2 ] ) , that the evolution of the @xmath62th mode is characterised by the nonlinear time @xmath80 based on solution ( [ eq:2.4 ] ) it is easy to see that for the `` first '' period ( if @xmath81 ) the evolution of the @xmath62th reverse mode at the initial stage @xmath82 may be described as @xmath83 on the other hand , at time @xmath84 , the mode transforms into a `` direct '' sawtooth wave with slope @xmath85  , independent of the amplitude and wavenumber of the mode : @xmath86 the density of energy @xmath87 , where @xmath88 denotes averaging over the period , is conserved before @xmath89 , and decreases like @xmath90 after @xmath91 .",
    "consider now the evolution of a gas of sticky particles in the case of independent evolution of the @xmath62th mode .",
    "in the general case , the density of the gas is calculated by using the jacobian of the transformation from lagrangian to eulerian coordinates and may be written in the form (  see , e.g. , @xcite  ) @xmath92 then it is obvious that at the initial stage @xmath93 while @xmath94 is zero outside this interval in each period . at time @xmath95",
    "all the light particles in each period collide into a single heavy particle with mass @xmath96 and the heavy particles have positions @xmath97 equal to the zero positions of the initial @xmath62th mode .",
    "the process of light merging particles and the evolution of the velocity is shown in fig.1 .",
    "consider now the joint evolution of two successive modes : @xmath62th and @xmath98th . from ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) one can see that the ratio of nonlinear times of the successive modes is @xmath99 which does not depend on @xmath62 and increases if the exponent @xmath100 is greater than @xmath101 .",
    "the gradient of the initial field   @xmath102  is  @xmath103 ,   so the effective nonlinear time for such a sum is @xmath104 because all parts of the initial perturbation have the same slope , all light particles will collide at the same time @xmath105 .",
    "the mass of heavy particles after merging are @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the distance between adjacent shocks in the initial perturbation .",
    "the ratio of periods of two adjacent modes is @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath109 is an integer larger than @xmath110 , there will be @xmath111 heavy particles on the period of the larger scale mode @xmath98th :   @xmath112 with the mass @xmath113  ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) , and two particles with total mass equal to @xmath114 .",
    "these two particles only exist when the shock of the @xmath98th mode is located in the interval between shocks of the @xmath62th mode . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider the case where the spatial relations @xmath115 between the phases of successive modes , hold . in this case the discontinuities of the @xmath98th mode do not produce new shocks in the total perturbation @xmath116 .",
    "thus , at times @xmath117 larger than @xmath118 , the masses of all heavy particles will be the same , as would be the case without the large scale modes ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) .",
    "the positions of these heavy particles at time @xmath119 are @xmath120 where @xmath121 are the zero positions of the @xmath62th mode ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) .",
    "the velocity of this particle is equal to @xmath122 .",
    "equation ( [ eq:2.22 ] ) is obvious if we use the trivial equality @xmath123 , and also note that the position of the heavy particle @xmath124 is equal to the position at the same time of all light particles with initial coordinate @xmath125 . from ( [ eq:2.22 ] )",
    "we immediately have that after time @xmath126 the positions of the particles are @xmath127 the difference between the coordinates of the adjacent particles @xmath128 and @xmath129 decreases with time , proportionally to the gradient of @xmath130 : @xmath131    these particles collide at time @xmath132 ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) and the newly created heavy particles will have masses @xmath133 and positions @xmath134 the velocity of these particles is zero .",
    "thus , at times @xmath117 larger then @xmath135 , the evolution of the initial perturbation @xmath136 will be the same as the evolution of only the large scale mode @xmath130 .",
    "the process of particles merging and the evolution of the velocity for the sum of two successive modes with the periods ratio @xmath137 are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    by recurrence ,",
    "it is evident that for finite number of modes @xmath138 the evolution of the field after @xmath139 will be the same as the evolution of only the largest mode @xmath140 .",
    "the reason for this , is of course , the special relation between the phases @xmath141 and the wavenumbers @xmath46 of all interacting modes : @xmath142 (  see equation ( [ kpapa0 ] )  ) . for integer",
    "@xmath57 the minimal value of any combination of these wavenumbers is equal to the largest mode wavenumber @xmath143 .",
    "so the nonlinear interaction does not produce new components at frequencies less than @xmath144 .",
    "let us now consider the interaction of the @xmath62th mode with an infinite series of larger scale modes @xmath145 assuming that the phases of the modes satisfy the relations (  [ eq:2.21 ]  ) and that  @xmath146 . from ( [ eq:2.27 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) we have for the gradient of the initial perturbation @xmath147 @xmath148 the condition @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) being necessary for the series to converge . from ( [ eq:2.28 ] )",
    ", we have for the effective time of nonlinearity of @xmath62th mode @xmath151 with the original @xmath152 determined by the equation ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) .    thus ,",
    "after the time of collision @xmath153 , heavy particles with mass @xmath154 ( [ eq:2.28 ] ) appear .",
    "the coordinates of these particles will be determined by an equation similar to ( [ eq:2.23 ] ) @xmath155 with the velocity of particles determined by the function @xmath156 ( see [ eq:2.27 ] ) , which is a sum of all larger modes , and @xmath157 are the coordinates of the zeros of the @xmath62th modes .",
    "the difference between the coordinates of adjacent particles @xmath121 and @xmath121 will then decrease with time like @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the inverse of the gradient of the function @xmath156 , see ( [ eq:2.27 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.28 ] ) .",
    "thus , the time of particle collision for this generation will be described by equation ( [ eq:2.29 ] ) with @xmath160 , and the new masses will be determined by the period of the @xmath98th mode - see equation ( [ eq:2.25 ] ) .",
    "the extrapolation of this particle merging process to the next generations is evident by recurrence .",
    "the @xmath161th collision of heavy particles takes place at time @xmath162 ) ,  the masses of these particles at this time are determined by the period of the @xmath163th mode @xmath164 ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) , ( [ eq:2.25 ] ) . in the time interval",
    "@xmath165 $ ] , @xmath166 the coordinates of particles will be determined by the equation ( [ eq:2.29a ] ) with @xmath167 . here",
    "@xmath168 is the sum of the velocities of all larger modes with @xmath169 , and @xmath170 are the zeros of @xmath163-th mode .",
    "it is important to note that at time @xmath171 the evolution of the particles is solely determined by the modes with @xmath172 .",
    "it means , that at times @xmath173 the position of the particles does not depend on the presence in the initial condition of the small scale modes with @xmath174 .",
    "thus , two processes with different initial velocities : @xmath175 , the field with small scales , and @xmath176 , the field without small scales modes : @xmath177 will have the same evolution after @xmath178 . even if @xmath179 ( when modes with very small scales @xmath180 and very large amplitudes @xmath181 are present in the initial perturbation ) the multiple merging of the particles will lead to the independence of the evolution of large scale modes with respect to the small scale modes .",
    "this effect is similar to the self  preservation of large scale structures in burgers turbulence @xcite,@xcite .",
    "when the initial field @xmath31 is noise , the highly nonlinear structures continuously interact and due to the merging of shocks , their characteristic scale @xmath4 constantly increases .",
    "the presence of small scale noise perturbation @xmath182 results in additional fluctuations in the shock coordinates @xmath183 , and these fluctuations increase in strength with the passage of time .",
    "thus , the final result of the evolution of the field is determined by the competition of two factors , the increase in the external scale @xmath4 of the structures and the increase in the strength @xmath183 of shock coordinates fluctuations , the later being related to the perturbation @xmath182 . in a turbulence , having power index @xmath1 ( [ eq : no4 ] ) , multiple merging of shocks leads to self - preservation of the large scale structures independently of the presence of small scale components . for the model signal this effect appears for arbitrary @xmath100 due to the special choice of wavenumbers and phases of interacting modes .",
    "it was stressed in the introduction that the solution of burgers equation has a one - to - one correspondence with the dynamics of the gas of inelastically interacting particles ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stage when all light particles collide , forming heavy particles , corresponds to the solution of burgers equation with a well - defined slope @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the profile of the field @xmath184 is fully determined by the coordinates and amplitudes of the shocks .",
    "their coordinates @xmath185 are equal to the coordinates of heavy particles , their velocity @xmath186 is equal to the velocity of the particles , and the amplitude of the shock @xmath187 is determined by the mass of the particle @xmath188 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the investigation of the motion of heavy particles permits to fully reconstruct the properties of the velocity field @xmath184 of burgers equation .",
    "it was shown in the previous section that the evolution of the particles ( shocks ) is determined by the function @xmath156 ( [ eq:2.27 ] ) .",
    "the basis functions of @xmath156 are the reverse sawtooth periodic functions with wavenumbers @xmath189 and amplitudes @xmath190 satisfy relations ( [ kpapa0 ] ) .",
    "wavenumbers form a geometrical progression like in the weierstrass function ( see @xcite ) and accumulate at the origin @xmath191 . in the original weierstrass function ,",
    "the situation was the opposite with increasing frequencies , but nevertheless the function @xmath156 has many properties of weierstrass function and of its generalisation  the weierstrass - mandelbrot function ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider here a deterministic function @xmath156 with the special phase relation @xmath192  @xmath193 ) , thus , the discontinuities in the largest modes @xmath194 coincide with some of the discontinuities of the smaller mode @xmath195 .",
    "the function @xmath156 is continuous in the intervals @xmath196 with the same slope in each interval .",
    "the inverse value of this slope @xmath197 @xmath198 is proportional to the nonlinear time @xmath135 of the smallest mode .",
    "of course , we need @xmath199 , so that the convergence of ( [ eq:2.28 ] ) is assured and the inequalities @xmath200 hold .",
    "the amplitudes of the modes are proportional to @xmath201 and for @xmath202 the function @xmath156 is bounded @xmath203    thus , for finite @xmath62 the energy of @xmath156 is also finite . for the case of the phase relation introduced above , the functions @xmath156 also have scaling properties , so that for instance for @xmath191 , we have @xmath204    the case @xmath205 is similar to the initial conditions with generalized white noise in burgers turbulence",
    ". the energy of the initial signal in such turbulence is determined by the largest cutoff wavenumber , so in our model by the smallest scale @xmath62 . if @xmath206 the energy of the model signal ( as the energy of white noise ) will tend to infinity .",
    "but from the considerations in the previous section we have that at the finite time @xmath117 all the modes with @xmath207 have finite energy @xmath208 due to the nonlinear dissipation , so that the whole energy of the turbulence is also finite . thus , even in the case of `` divergent '' initial conditions @xmath209 , we will have a `` convergent '' solution for any time @xmath210 .",
    "the case @xmath211 is similar to having fractional brownian motion initial condition in burgers turbulence . in this case , the series ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) diverges and the initial signal @xmath156 is unbounded . but for burgers turbulence (  for the process of particles motion and collisions  ) only relative velocity of the particles matters .",
    "so we can use the same regularisation procedure with @xmath156 .",
    "such a procedure was done with the weierstrass function in @xcite .    in our case , taking @xmath212 , we can introduce the function @xmath213 , according to @xcite , which is finite in all finite spatial intervals .",
    "the other way to get a bounded function is to use special phase relations for the modes .",
    "here we summarise the properties of the evolution of the multiscale deterministic signal using some additional information about scaling characteristics of @xmath156 , and compare them with the properties of the burgers turbulence .",
    "let us consider the evolution of the multiscale signal @xmath214 it was shown that at times @xmath117 for which @xmath215 , heavy particles with mass @xmath216 appear and their coordinates are determined by the relation ( [ eq:2.30 ] ) .",
    "these particles collide at time @xmath197 ,  ( @xmath217 ) , and new particles with masses @xmath218 appear .",
    "their motion will be determined by the same law ( [ eq:2.30 ] ) with substitution @xmath219 . using the scaling properties of @xmath156 ( [ eq:3.3 ] ) we have , that the motion of the particles in this interval will be similar to the motion of the particles in the interval @xmath220$]if we rescale the time @xmath221 . since the ratio @xmath222 does not depend on @xmath62",
    ", one can speak about the logarithmic periodic self - similarity of the motion of the particles .",
    "this means that at arbitrary interval @xmath223 $ ] the motion of the particles will be similar to the motion of the particles in the interval @xmath224 , by the scaling factor @xmath225 in space , and the scaling function @xmath226 in time .",
    "the coordinates and masses of the particles fully determine the velocity field , and so the solution of burgers equation is also logarithmic periodic self  similar .    with each collision",
    ", the mass @xmath227 of the particles increases @xmath228 times .",
    "the time interval between the two successive collisions increases as @xmath229 .",
    "thus , by the approximation of piecewise constant function @xmath230 by the power law @xmath231 we obtain the same result as for the burgers turbulence . in our case , @xmath232 is proportional to the period of the smallest mode at time @xmath117 , and is analogous to the integral scale in burgers turbulence .    in the case",
    "@xmath202 we can also estimate the energy decay of the model signal . for @xmath202 and @xmath233 the main energy of the signal at time",
    "@xmath117 is in the smallest mode and is proportional to @xmath234.thus , we have here again the same law for the energy decay as for burgers turbulence .",
    "the numerical simulation based on the algorithm @xcite was done to illustrate the process of particles merging and velocity field evolution .",
    "the trajectories of the particles and profile of the field at different times are plotted for the initial `` white noise '' signal ( @xmath235 ) in fig.3 , and for the initial `` brownian '' motion ( @xmath236 ) in fig.4 .",
    "ten modes with the ratio of successive wavenumbers @xmath237 were used .",
    "the plots show the initial stage of the evolution in some relatively small region where the finiteness of the number of modes is not significant .    in fig .  3",
    "one can see that for @xmath238 the initial `` sawtooth '' multiscale function oscillates near @xmath239 like a `` white noise '' with finite variance .",
    "after the collision of light particles , when the reverse sawtooth function transforms into a sawtooth wave with positive gradient @xmath21 , the structure of the signal is relatively simple , and even for @xmath137 the main energy remains in the mode with smallest wavenumber .",
    "in the case @xmath240 the initial profile has a large deviation behaviour which is typical for brownian motion functions . after merging of light particles ,",
    "the sawtooth profile has a set of small shocks with different amplitudes , which is also similar to the properties of brownian signal in the burgers turbulence @xcite .    in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 4(c ) the velocity field at three successive merger times @xmath241 are plotted .",
    "these figures show the logarithmic periodic self - similarity of the evolution of multiscale signals .",
    "we notice now that such multiscale waves may be constructed for multidimensional burgers equation .",
    "let us assume that the initial vector field @xmath242 is an infinite series of `` reverse '' modes @xmath243 : @xmath244 in the two dimensional case , the @xmath245th `` reverse '' mode may be composed of piecewise linear functions defined on a system of regular triangles of size @xmath246 covering the plane .",

    "the value @xmath252 has the dimension of time , and at the finite time @xmath253 the velocity gradient becomes infinite .    on the other hand , at time @xmath254 , the mode transforms into a `` direct '' sawtooth wave with the universal behaviour inside the new set of triangles and with the gradient @xmath255 independent of the amplitude and wavenumber of the mode : @xmath256 where @xmath257 is now the center of the triangle , coinciding with the top of the initial triangular set .",
    "consider now the evolution of a gas of sticky particles in the case of independent evolution of the @xmath245th mode .",
    "then , it is obvious that at the initial stage , inside the `` collapsing '' triangle of size @xmath251 the density increases as @xmath258 while @xmath94 is zero outside `` collapsing '' triangular in each cell . at time @xmath259 , all the light particles in each cell collide into a single heavy particle with mass @xmath260 and the heavy particles positions are equal to the center of the initial triangle @xmath249 .",
    "we assume also that the evolution of the @xmath245th mode is characterised by a nonlinear time @xmath261 the same as in the one dimension case ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) : @xmath262    let us now consider the evolution of the vector field @xmath242 ( [ eq : wvec ] ) which is an infinite series of `` reverse '' modes .",
    "the evolution of the vector field is very similar to the evolution of the scalar field ( [ eq:2.27 ] ) . for the gradient of the initial perturbation",
    "@xmath242 we have the same relation ( [ eq:2.28 ] ) as in @xmath263 .",
    "the effective time of nonlinearity of the smallest @xmath62th mode in the vector field ( [ eq : wvec ] ) , in presence of all large scale modes , is determined by the equation ( [ eq:2.29 ] ) .",
    "thus , after the time of collision @xmath153 , heavy particles with mass @xmath264 ( [ eqm2 ] ) appear .",
    "velocities of these particles will be determined by the function @xmath265 , which is a sum of all larger modes , but the number of particle collisions is determined by the next @xmath266 mode . at time @xmath197 we have a collision of four heavy particles .",
    "the extrapolation of this particle merger process to next generations is evident by recurrence .",
    "the @xmath161th collision of heavy particles takes place at time @xmath267 ) , ( [ eq : time ] ) the masses of these particles at this time are determined by the scale of the @xmath163th mode @xmath268 ( [ eqm2 ] ) . here",
    "also one can speak about the logarithmic periodic self - similarity of the motion of the particles .",
    "this means that at arbitrary interval @xmath223 $ ] the motion of the particles will be similar to the motion of the particles in the interval @xmath224 , by the scaling factor @xmath269 in space , and the scaling function @xmath270 in time .",
    "we used computer simulation for studying two dimensional case ; results of the simulation were generated in so called vrml ( virtual reality modeling language ) , which enables to handle three dimensional figure in different projections .",
    "6 presents snapshots of this modeling . on the fig .",
    "6(a ) one can see that particles formed by small triangles move towards the center of an embracing triangle ; this center in its turn , moves towards the center of the next bigger triangle in the hierarchy ; e.t.c .",
    "fig.6(b ) gives the side - view of this process .",
    "in conclusion , we would like to point out that the evolution of the multiscale signal with the weierstrass spectrum simulates properties of burgers turbulence such as self - similarity , conservation of large scale structures and has the same laws of the energy decay and integral scale .",
    "the difference between the deterministic model and burgers turbulence is that here we have the exact solution for the evolution of multiscale signals and these properties are not stochastic but deterministic .",
    "the evolution of the multiscale signal is exactly self - similar in logarithmically spaced time intervals .",
    "the evolution of the large scale modes is completely independent of the small scales modes , even if these have very large amplitudes .",
    "these properties take place for burgers turbulence in the stochastical sense and , moreover , for a signal with cutoff frequencies of small scales , only asymptotically .",
    "of course , these properties of the multiscale signal are determined by the special form of modes ( reverse sawtooth function ) , the special relations between wavenumbers of modes ( @xmath271 , where @xmath57 is an integer ) and their phase relations .",
    "on the other hand , these model signals do not reflect such properties of burgers turbulence as qualitative difference in the behaviour of the turbulence for @xmath1 and @xmath28 in the power spectrum ( [ eq : energy ] ) due to the process of generation of large scale components in the spectrum .",
    "for the deterministic model this process is not present due to the special relation of wavenumbers .",
    "let as now move to the mechanical interpretation of solution of the burgers equation .",
    "for the initial reverse sawtooth wave , all the matter turns into heavy particles at the same moment of time .",
    "thus , after this time , the evolution of burgers turbulence is fully determined by the motion of heavy particles .",
    "the trajectories of heavy particles form regular tree - like structure on the plane @xmath272 , see figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "the properties of this structure depend on the parameters of our model .",
    "the integer @xmath273 is the number of trajectories which intersect at one point and form a new branch of our structure .",
    "for @xmath274 we , thus , obtain binary tree structure .",
    "changing of the parameter @xmath50 stretches or contracts the structure in the @xmath117 direction .",
    "one can say that our structure is the plane representation of the @xmath275tree ; the root of our tree is located at @xmath276 .",
    "this tree is similar to the flattened fractal model of botanical umbrella tree ( see @xcite ) . if we take some node @xmath277 of this structure as a root , and consider the trajectories of all heavy particles , which will merge at the moment of time @xmath278 at this point @xmath277 we shall also obtain an @xmath100-tree .",
    "the whole tree seems self - similar , because every branch plus the branches it carries is a reduced scale version of the whole .",
    "we also notice that such multiscale waves may be constructed for multidimensional burgers equation .",
