    "analysing the spindown of low - mass stars is one of the most notorious and difficult issues in astrophysics .",
    "we are dealing with a multi - faceted problem : the spin of stars is a function to fundamental stellar properties ",
    "mass , radius , age .",
    "the rotation rate is also affected by the star formation process , including the collapse of molecular cloud cores , the formation of binaries and planetary systems , and accretion from circumstellar disks . finally , the stellar magnetic field , its generation , structure and interaction with the stellar atmosphere plays a dominant role for the regulation of the rotation from the t tauri phase to the age of the sun .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the spindown of stars thus requires input from a broad range of fields .",
    "while i will mostly focus on rotation itself , i encourage the reader to explore related chapters in this volume , for example the reviews by edwards , donati , kker , stelzer , basri , as well as the splinter session summary by reiners et al ..    in this review , i will trace the spin of stars from @xmath0myr , the age of the orion nebula cluster , to 4.5gyr , the age of the sun . in this time frame ,",
    "the angular momentum of stars is primarily controlled by two mechanisms : 1 ) _ disk braking _",
    ", used here as a generic term for mechanisms that remove angular momentum from the star via the interaction between star and disk , including disk - locking and accretion - powered stellar winds .",
    "2 ) _ wind braking _ , i. e. angular momentum losses due to magnetized stellar winds .",
    "while disk braking operates on relatively short timescales compatible with the disk lifetime of 1 - 10myr , wind braking is a long - term process and regulates the spindown on timescales of hundreds of myr .",
    "this allows us to discuss the two processes separately : in the first part of this review , the focus will be on disk braking , i.e. the evolution in the pre - main sequence phase . in the second part , wind braking will be discussed by investigating the long - term evolution on the main - sequence .",
    "i will focus on objects with masses ranging from about one solar mass down to the substellar regime .",
    "reviewing the rotational evolution of stars and brown dwarfs is a timely exercise , for two reasons :    \\1 ) we have recently experienced an enormous growth in the number of objects with known periods , covering a wide range of ages and masses .",
    "rotation rates are traditionally measured using two techniques , photometric monitoring providing rotation periods and high - resolution spectroscopy providing projected rotational velocities @xmath1 from doppler line broadening .",
    "thanks to the availability of wide - field imagers at 2 - 4 m class telescopes as well as the exploitation of planetary transit survey , the rotational database now comprises periods for about 3000 objects , and counting .",
    "in addition , the availability of high - resolution multi - object spectrographs ( e.g. , flames at the vlt ) has significantly enlarged the pool of @xmath1 data .",
    "\\2 ) a number of new developments over the past five years have enabled studies that provide important complementary insights .",
    "examples are the availability of the spitzer telescope for mid - infrared studies of disk braking ( see contribution by baliber , this volume ) and the ongoing efforts to determine magnetic field structures from zeeman doppler imaging ( see review by donati , this volume )",
    ". combining the rotational data with these additional information yields a new , comprehensive picture of the angular momentum evolution of stars .",
    "the initial distribution of rotation rates of low - mass stars is now well - established , thanks to extensive survey work in clusters at 1 - 2myr , mainly the onc and ngc2264 . for a detailed discussion of the available data in these two clusters",
    "see for example .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the period distribution in the onc and ngc2264 , as published by .",
    "three features in these histograms should be highlighted : a ) at this early age , the objects show a broad range of periods , mostly between 1 and 10d with a tail extending to @xmath2d .",
    "b ) the median period drops with decreasing object mass in the considered mass range .",
    "c ) the distribution is bimodal for solar - mass stars , but unimodal for very low mass stars ( see the review by @xcite ) .    as of today",
    ", the datasets in the onc and ngc2264 do not include the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs ( but see the contribution by rodriguez - ledesma in this volume for an update ) .",
    "in general , the period database for substellar objects is sparsely populated .",
    "nonetheless , the available data allows us first important conclusions . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we show periods for objects with masses of 0.02 to 0.3@xmath3 in the @xmath4myr old @xmath5ori region .",
    "as can be seen in this plot , the trend of declining median period towards lower masses , as seen in the onc , continues steadily in the substellar regime . as a result , the median period for brown dwarfs is shorter than one day , and the fast rotators in this mass regime are at periods of 3 - 5h ( ) .",
    "these rotation rates are comparable to the _ breakup limit _ , the value where centrifugal and gravitational forces are in balance at the equator .",
    "the first 5myr in the spin evolution are characterized by strong rotational regulation .",
    "this has been firmly established in a number of recent studies , based on the growing rotational database in young open clusters and star forming regions ( e.g. , see also the review in @xcite ) . a good illustration of this finding",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] : the average @xmath1 at 1 - 5myr is clearly inconsistent with angular momentum conservation ; instead it roughly follows the trend expected for angular velocity ( hence period ) conservation .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of a rotational braking mechanism affecting a fraction of the objects that decreases with age .",
    "the maximum timescale for this type of regulation is @xmath4myr , consistent with the lifetime of accretion disks , a first indication that the braking mechanism is related to the presence of a disk .",
    "in fact , this is the underlying assumption in the most commonly discussed scenarios for the strong rotational regulation in the t tauri phase ( called disk braking in the following ) . the theories for this mechanism essentially fall in two groups : either the angular momentum is extracted directly from the star , or it is transferred from the star to the disk .",
    "disk - locking is probably the leading idea here : according to the standard picture ( @xcite ) , star and disk are coupled by the strong stellar magnetic field . as a result , the disk exhibits a torque onto the star , and thus slows down its rotation .",
    "angular momentum is moved from the star to the disk and then carried away in a disk wind .",
    "one possible realization of a disk - locking scenario is the x - wind model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternative models for disk braking are based on stellar winds . a solar - type wind as in main - sequence objects",
    ", however , would not be sufficient for the strong braking seen in t tauri stars .",
    "this leads to the idea of stellar winds powered by accretion .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that accretion - driven winds can in principle explain the observational picture , if the mass outflow rates are a substantial fraction of the accretion rates ( @xmath6% ) .    for observational studies of disk braking",
    ", it is important to point out that both types of models  accretion - powered winds and disk - locking  require the presence of a disk and a coupling between star and disk .",
    "thus , observations should primarily aim to establish whether a connection between disk and rotation is present or not .",
    "@xcite have presented first evidence for such a connection , in the sense that objects with near - infrared colour - excess , indicative of an inner disk , are primarily seen as slow rotators . while some studies have confirmed this early finding ( e.g. , ) , others did not ( e.g. , @xcite ) .     vs. @xmath7 for young stars .",
    "the points with error bars in both directions are the average @xmath8 for all stars within the specified range in @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 values for many individual clusters are also plotted , approximate ages as a function of r are indicated .",
    "the solid line shows the best linear fit , exluding the datapoint at 10myr .",
    "the dashed lines are the relations expected for evolution with constant angular velocity ( slope of @xmath9 ) , and constant angular momentum ( slope of @xmath10 ) .",
    "the observed slope is within 2@xmath11 of the prediction for constant angular velocity , but inconsistent with the value expected for conservation of angular momentum .",
    "figure from @xcite [ f3 ] ]    the mid - infrared observations from the spitzer spacecraft telescope , launched 2003 , have greatly improved our understanding of circumstellar disks .",
    "for the first time , spitzer provides unambiguous and reliable disk indicators for the large numbers of objects in the onc and ngc2264 with measured rotation periods .",
    "based on spitzer data , @xcite indeed find strong evidence for disk braking : the overwhelming majority of the objects with disks are slow rotators with periods @xmath12d .",
    "a similarly clear result has been obtained for ngc2264 by @xcite .",
    "it is probably fair to say that most the researchers working in the field today believe that the presence of a disk clearly plays a role for the rotational braking .    on the other hand ,",
    "negative results regarding disk braking have been obtained for ic348 ( age 2 - 4myr , @xcite ) , taurus , and chamaeleon i ( @xmath13myr , nguyen et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "we are still looking at partly controversial findings , possibly pointing at environmental differences .",
    "a number of aspects can dilute a signature of disk braking , e.g. , age spread , binarity , dispersion in disk lifetimes , or insufficient sample size . if and how these factors can explain all the observational results is currently under investigation ( see the contribution by baliber , this volume ) . in standard disk braking scenarios",
    "it is not the mere presence of a disk , but the coupling between star and disk that provides the angular momentum removal .",
    "thus , a more detailed understanding requires to look at a variety of disk braking diagnostics , including emission lines affected by accretion and winds ( see review by edwards , this volume ) .",
    "another open issue is the mass dependence of this mechanism , which can be probed by looking at the very low mass objects in star forming region .",
    "studies of disk braking in brown dwarfs are rare , mainly due to a lack of overlap of period and spitzer data .",
    "the few existing constraints , however , indicate that disk braking is at work in substellar objects as well ( ) .",
    "however , the signature of disk braking , as seen in spitzer data , becomes weaker at very low masses ( @xcite ) , pointing to imperfect disk braking ( ) .",
    "this might be explained by a mass dependency in the magnetic field topology and will be subject of future programs .",
    "the rotational picture in the age range 10 - 100myr is difficult to interpret , because we see superimposed the effects of disk braking , the strong pre - main sequence contraction , as well as the beginning of wind braking . in a recent paper , however , we have shown that the median @xmath1 for stars covering ages from 5 to 30myr is inconsistent with the expected evolution for angular velocity conservation , but roughly in agreement with angular momentum conservation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the behaviour at 1 - 5myr , as discussed above ( see fig . [ f3 ] ) , indicating a sharp change in the rotational braking at 5 - 10myr .",
    "this is readily explained by the disk dissipation , causing the breakdown of disk braking , resulting in rapid spinup due to the contraction .",
    "including rotational data at @xmath14myr shows the onset of wind braking : the median rotation rates are significantly lower than expected from pure angular momentum conservation ( @xcite ) .",
    "wind braking is thought to be the dominant mechanism of rotational braking on the main - sequence and will be discussed in detail below .",
    "this sequence of events  disk braking , rapid spinup due to contraction , and onset of wind braking  is probably applicable to very low mass stars and brown dwarfs as well ( , scholz & eislffel , in prep . ) .      the rotational braking due to stellar winds is usually quantified in parameterized angular momentum loss laws based on the description given by @xcite , derived from wind physics by @xcite : @xmath15 .",
    "we distinguish two regimes :    \\a ) the linear regime includes all objects with @xmath16 and is calculated with @xmath17 , reproducing the skumanich law @xmath18 , the empirically established angular momentum loss law for solar - type main - sequence stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "\\b ) the saturated regime comprises all fast rotating objects with @xmath19 and is characterized by @xmath20 , resulting in an exponential evolution of angular momentum . to fit the observational data ,",
    "@xmath21 is normally assumed to be a function of object mass .",
    "this semi - empirical description is at the core of the most commonly used models for the rotational evolution ( ) . for the two different regimes , i will use the nomenclature suggested by @xcite : i - sequence for the linear regime and c - sequence for the saturated regime .    in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] a large sample of rotation periods , mostly from the _ monitor _ program ( @xcite ) , is compared to models including disk braking at 1 - 5myr and wind braking following the approach given above .",
    "the models provide a reasonable fit to the typical period evolution for solar - mass stars from a few myr to 4.5gyr .",
    "for very low masses , the models reproduce the datapoints for ages @xmath22myr , but require a different scaling for @xmath21 to match the periods in praesepe .",
    "most solar - mass stars go through a phase on the c - sequence at ages @xmath23myr , before they switch to the i - sequence , causing rapid spindown .",
    "in contrast , very low mass stars stay on the c - sequence for timescales @xmath24myr and thus continue to be fast rotators . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ f9 ] , there are clearly issues in reproducing the total range of periods at any given age , which can partly be resolved by taking into account core - envelope decoupling , variable disk lifetimes , and binarity .",
    "the availability of parameterized models for the rotational evolution allows us to pursue gyrochronology  measuring ages of stars based on rotation rates  a method recently put forward by @xcite and others .",
    "gyrochronology relies on an accurate calibration of the spindown rates , obtained from stars with known ages .",
    "while gyro ages for solar - mass stars may already be more reliable than ages estimated from other indicators ( e.g. , activity , kinematic ) , the calibration at very low masses requires further work .",
    "as discussed above , the common description of the main - sequence wind braking includes a bimodal angular momentum loss law .",
    "this bimodality can be clearly seen in observational data , particularly when rotation is plotted vs. object mass . in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we show periods in clusters at an age of @xmath25myr as a function of spectral type , used as a proxy for mass ( @xcite ) . at this age ,",
    "the objects have essentially forgotten their pre - main sequence history , thus their rotation rates are primarily determined by wind braking .",
    "the most obvious feature in the period - mass relation is a break at spectral types k8-m2 , corresponding to masses of @xmath26 .",
    "while late k stars are already spun down at the age of 700myr to periods @xmath27d , m stars at the same age are still fast rotating with periods @xmath28d .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the decline of the periods continues to late m spectral types .",
    "the transition from slowly rotating k dwarfs ( i - sequence ) to fast rotating m dwarfs ( c - sequence ) separates the two regimes of rotational braking .",
    "this transition is likely to be a function of mass , shifting to later spectral types as the objects become older . in @xmath1 data of field",
    "dwarfs it is observed at spectral types of @xmath29m3-m4 ( , see reiners et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "interpreting the transition from i- to c - sequence and the underlying physics is one of the most relevant outstanding issues in this field . as of today",
    ", we do not have a clear understanding for the breakdown of the skumanich law at very low masses .",
    "it is tempting to explain the bimodal spindown as a consequence of the interior structure of stars : while solar - mass stars on the main - sequence have a radiative core , pre - main sequence stars and very low mass objects are fully convective .",
    "the presence of an interface layer between radiative core and convective envelope is often argued to be of prime importance for the generation of the large - scale magnetic field of the sun ( see also the contributions by priest , kker , this volume ) .",
    "the absence of a radiative core may cause a change in the magnetic field generation , the magnetic topology , and thus the characteristics of the stellar wind .",
    "there is indeed evidence for a change in the magnetic properties that goes along with the breakdown of the skumanich braking at very low masses .",
    "for example , h@xmath30 activity is strongly enhanced at spectral types @xmath31m3 in field objects ( ) . moreover , there are indications that the structure of the large - scale magnetic field ( @xcite ) as well as the properties of magnetically induced spots ( ) change in the very low mass regime .",
    "thus , the observed change in the spindown at very low masses may be one observational manifestation among others for the presence of two regimes of magnetic properties .",
    "for further progress in this field , it is crucial to learn more about dynamo activity , magnetic field emergence , stellar winds , and how they depend on stellar age and mass . in particular , the currently used parameterized wind braking law as described above is suspect , as it has been designed and repeatedly adapted to account for observational findings , for example to match the skumanich law and to reproduce fast rotating very low mass objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "studies on how to improve the currently existing models are underway ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the long - term perspective should be to replace the parameterized spindown laws by physical models , and thus describe the rotational evolution from first principles .",
