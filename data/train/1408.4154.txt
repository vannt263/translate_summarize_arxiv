    "evolutionary dynamics describes the dynamics of populations as the result of the interplay between ecological interactions and phenotypic variation .",
    "the ecological mechanism of replication / selection seems to be well described by an ordinary differential equation , where the rate of growth of any specie ( i.e.  the balance between births and deaths ) depends on the composition of the entire population . such rate , also known as the relative fitness , is actually the difference between the absolute fitness of the species of interest and the mean fitness of the population .",
    "several shapes have been proposed for the absolute fitness . when one is modeling phenotypes , the choice of a constant fitness seems fair , but , starting with the seminal work by maynard smith and price @xcite , an important amount of research deals with ideas arising from mathematical game theory , see @xcite and references therein . in this framework ,",
    "the prisoner s dilemma has attracted a lot of attention : we mention @xcite for a detailed account of the state of the art about this topic .",
    "the first attempt of giving account of mutations , dating back to the 70 , is the so called `` quasispecies equation '' , where the growth rate of any specie is modified by considering the dispersion due to the birth of mutated offspring .",
    "see , for instance , the reference book @xcite .",
    "the same underlying idea has been included in the evolutionary games setting with the `` replicator - mutator '' equation in @xcite . an interesting and exhaustive account of evolutionary dynamics can be found in the book @xcite .",
    "more recently , macroscopic pde models have been proposed and studied ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "a different approach focus on the stochastic dynamics of each individual in the population , as for instance dieckmann and law @xcite , who analyzed the related moment equations .",
    "finally , the emerging field of adaptive dynamics has emphasized that selection and mutation act in two different time - scales , and therefore proposed models based on the combination of jump processes and ordinary differential equations .",
    "see , for instance , the trait substitution sequences @xcite .",
    "a unifying treatment is provided in @xcite , where various macroscopic models are obtained as the limit of one microscopic model by performing different types of rescaling .    in @xcite",
    "it has been introduced a macroscopic stochastic model for the selection - mutation process , that goes into the direction of adaptive dynamics .",
    "selection is described by a deterministic differential equation , where the relative fitness rules the reproductive rate .",
    "mutation , instead , is described by a marked point process . unlike trait substitution sequence",
    ", no assumption is made about the selection dynamics .",
    "specifically it is not asked that there is invasion or extinction of the mutant trait between subsequent mutations .",
    "the related stochastic differential equation has been studied and a kolmogorov equation has been deduced and investigated analytically .",
    "such kolmogorov equation is of integro - differential type : the non - local term is the deterministic counterpart of the marked point process modeling mutation and therefore shows up even if the total number of strategies is finite .",

    "\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] in @xcite , the analytical theory of the solutions to problem was started .",
    "global existence and regularity results were proved together with some results about the qualitative behavior of solutions for long times in the quasispecies case . even if the main picture was sufficiently clear , which is that there are situations where mutations are able to contrast dominant strategies , it is difficult to say what happens in the general case of density - dependent fitness , for instance in the prisoner s dilemma case .",
    "this is the main motivation to study the problem by a numerical simulation side . from the numerical point of view , there are two main difficulties in the approximation of problem that require some effort .",
    "we shall see in fact that , as time increases , a standard upwind approximation mainly fails due to the blowing up of the first derivative @xmath19 and also due to the presence of the non - local term .",
    "the numerical investigation then require extremely fine meshes over a small portion of the domain to resolve the solution , especially for large time simulations . to deal with these difficulty we shall propose to adopt an adaptive numerical grid which thickens with the increasing of time near the right boundary @xmath20 , and an ad - hoc approximation of the nonlocal term near at @xmath20 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ 2 ] we settle the model and briefly recall the main analytical results obtained in @xcite .",
    "we also give some extensions that apply to the density - dependent framework .",
    "section [ 3 ] is devoted to the presentation of a suitable numerical scheme and to some simulations .",
    "section [ 4 ] contains some conclusions .",
    "our main concern is exploring the relation among point type rare mutations , described by equation , and continuous rare mutations , described by the canonical replicator mutator equation , see @xcite , @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the selection spread as before , @xmath23 stands for the mutation probability from species 0 to species 1 , and viceversa for @xmath24 . to this aim",

    "moreover , as time grows , @xmath19 grows exponentially in time giving a loss of accuracy on the approximation .",
    "we note that , for some set of problem parameters , we will get the same kind of behaviour solving the more general problem .",
