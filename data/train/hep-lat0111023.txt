    "for the final talk of this exciting conference i have chosen a small number of subjects where the progress impressed me , or which dominated the field lately , or simply lie close to my heart .    the first part deals with the heroic work of the cp - pacs and rbc groups on @xmath0 .",
    "it is exciting and somewhat frightening to see how brains , software and hardware come together in a highly relevant project which is then pushed to the end ( which does not necessarily mean full success ) .",
    "the second part is on chiral symmetric fermions .",
    "this field went through a rapid development during the last few years and attracted many contributions at this conference also .",
    "the third part contains selected topics : topological susceptibility , some remarks on light hadron spectroscopy and a few words on cut - off effects .    in a few cases",
    "i will raise questions , discuss issues which keep bugging me .",
    "these parts will be separated from the main text .",
    "it might be that some of them reflect my ignorance only .",
    "there are many reasons for discussing this problem here .",
    "the @xmath3 decay contains highly relevant physics , it is a very active field of current research and a central problem of our community since the early years of lattice calculations@xcite .",
    "this complex problem is related to exciting theoretical methods and issues like operator product expansion , ( quenched ) chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath4 ) , composite operator renormalization , chiral symmetry , etc .",
    "interesting possibilities were discussed recently@xcite to avoid the maiani - testa problem@xcite due to three external particles in the @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "preliminary results using three - point functions have been presented in martinelli s plenary talk@xcite . here",
    "i will discuss the reduction method used by the cp - pacs@xcite and rbc groups@xcite . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 matrixelement is related to the @xmath1 and @xmath5 matrixelements@xcite . without a chiral symmetric regularization",
    "the problem is not tractable .",
    "both groups used domain wall fermions@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 decay exhibits two significant phenomena of the standard model : the @xmath6 rule and the mixing induced and direct cp violation .",
    "the dynamics of these decays is determined by a non - trivial interplay of strong and electroweak forces characterized by several energy scales of very different magnitude from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . at present",
    "there is no way to treat all these scales at the same time on the lattice . to disentangle long and short distance contributions operator product expansion",
    "is used .      consider the @xmath9 transition in leading order of the weak interactions . the quark level transition on the l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] is dressed with qcd interactions ( the spectator quark is suppressed ) .",
    "since @xmath10 is large relative to the typical momentum @xmath11 of this problem and so the @xmath12 boson propagates over a short distance , the four fermion interaction is almost point like .",
    "this makes a systematic expansion possible for this amplitude : @xmath13 with @xmath14 corrections .",
    "qcd effects above the factorization scale @xmath15 are included in the wilson coefficient @xmath16 , the low energy contributions below @xmath15 are collected into the matrixelement of the local four fermion operators @xmath17 .",
    "this concept of factorization lies at the hart of many qcd applications and i am not aware of reasons to question its applicability .",
    "if @xmath18 , we expect that the wilson coefficient @xmath19 can be calculated in perturbation theory ( pt ) .",
    "the factorization implies that @xmath16 is independent of the external states and can be calculated using off - shell quarks with high virtuality on both sides of the equation in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the scale @xmath15 has to be chosen judiciously .",
    "it should be large enough to justify pt when calculating @xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , if only three light quarks are simulated on the lattice ( charm is integrated out ) , @xmath15 can not be larger than @xmath20 gev .",
    "the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] actually generates two four - fermion operators with different color structure @xmath21 where @xmath22 are color indices and the short - hand notation @xmath23 is used here and below .",
    "the sum of these operators ( weighted with the wilson coefficients which include @xmath24 from the ckm matrix ) taken between the incoming kaon and the outgoing pions in isospin @xmath25 , or 2 states @xmath26 @xmath27 should explain the large ratio @xmath28 i.e. the @xmath29 rule .",
    "in eq  ( [ 7.2 ] ) @xmath30 is the phase shift from the final state @xmath31 interaction , and @xmath32 wilson coefficients ( and the additional ones for @xmath33 below ) are known in the standard model at next - to - leading order@xcite . on the other hand , the weak interaction part of the tree graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] does not know about the third generation and is so cp conserving . in order to see cp violation we have to go beyond this leading approximation and include the qcd penguin and electroweak diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian is a sum over 10 operators@xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 problem is expected to be dominated by the @xmath34 and @xmath35 contributions since the functions @xmath36 are small for @xmath33 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "phenomenological considerations suggest@xcite that the imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 , is dominated by @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in this approximation",
    "the direct cp violation is given by @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 it is reassuring that this qualitative expectation is supported by the numerical data@xcite .",
    "although the contribution from @xmath45 is suppressed by the electroweak coupling constant , this is largely compensated by the prefactor @xmath46 leading to a numerically unpleasant cancellation between the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ 8.3 ] ) .",
    "the cp - pacs and rbc collaborations followed the reduction method , where tree level @xmath48 is used to relate the @xmath49 matrixelements to those of @xmath50 and @xmath51 vacuum@xcite which are then calculated on the lattice .",
    "although the reduction step simplifies the problem significantly , it introduces an unpleasant mixing with a lower dimensional two - quark operator .",
    "the @xmath52 operators , like @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ 8.4 ] ) , mix with the two - quark operator @xmath54 since the singlet right handed part communicates with the vacuum@xcite .",
    "this @xmath52 operator should be cps ( cp + @xmath55 ) invariant ( as all the @xmath56 operators are ) leading to the form for @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ 9.1 ] ) the equation of motion was used to write @xmath60 as a total divergence for @xmath57 . in the physical @xmath61 matrixelement",
    "this total divergence does not contribute since the weak operator carries zero momentum .",
    "on the other hand , for the @xmath62 reduced matrixelement @xmath60 gives a ( quadratically divergent ) contribution : if @xmath63 @xmath64 is used in the simulation ( cp - pacs,@xcite ) then @xmath60 is not a total divergence ; if @xmath57 ( rbc , @xcite ) then the operator carries momentum and the total divergence contributes .",
    "this quadratic divergence should be subtracted from the @xmath65 operator matrixelements with a coefficient determined by the corresponding @xmath66 matrixelement .",
    "the reduction equations have the form ( @xmath67 mev ) @xmath68 @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 is determined by @xmath72 the @xmath73 operators have no subtractions and for @xmath70 the relations are like in eq .",
    "( [ 10.1 ] ) with @xmath74 . for @xmath75",
    "we have @xmath76 in the equations above @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the physical masses , while in the @xmath1 matrixelement @xmath79 .",
    "remarks :    @xmath80 the reduction is on the tree level of ( q)@xmath81pt only .",
    "the @xmath82 low energy constants needed for @xmath0 can not be found from the @xmath1 , @xmath66 matrixelements .",
    "one can use the @xmath82 ( q)@xmath81pt results for @xmath1 @xcite to make a more reliable fit for the tree level constants , but even in this case @xmath0 will be obtained on the tree level only .",
    "the 1-loop chiral corrections are estimated to be significant ( @xmath83mev ! ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath80 the reduction step relies heavily on chiral symmetry .",
    "the mixing problem can not be treated in the @xmath6 sector with wilson fermions .    @xmath80 both groups demonstrated that a controlled signal can be obtained after the power divergent subtraction .",
    "@xmath80 as eq .",
    "( [ 10.1 ] ) shows the @xmath50 matrixelements should vanish in the chiral limit @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "cp - pacs finds that this is the case within the errors , rbc observes small non - zero intercepts which might be related to the residual chiral symmetry breaking of the domain wall fermions . as eq .",
    "( [ 10.1 ] ) shows , the slope is all what one needs .",
    "cp - pacs used renormalization factors calculated in 1-loop pt @xcite .",
    "rbc applied the roma - southampton non - perturbative method with gauge fixing@xcite .",
    "the parameters of the simulations of cp - pacs and rbc are quite similar . on the real part of @xmath86 and so on the @xmath6 rule , rbc obtained results close to those in experiments , while the results on @xmath87 and @xmath88 from cp - pacs are a factor of @xmath89 smaller .",
    "both groups obtained a small negative @xmath90 number for @xmath91 as opposed to the experimental average of @xmath92@xcite .",
    "given the large theoretical and numerical complexity of the problem i find these works very impressive .",
    "there are several possible sources of systematical error , like quenching , large corrections to tree level reduction in @xmath81pt and ( continuum ) pt at scales @xmath93gev .",
    "in@xcite the authors argue that a new low energy constant ( a pure quenching artifact ) enters the reduction relations which might have an influence on the results above .",
    "we had four plenary talks at this conference which were directly on this subject@xcite , or were closely related@xcite .",
    "i would like to discuss here a few points only@xcite .",
    "the ginsparg - wilson ( gw ) relation@xcite was suggested as the mildest way to break chiral symmetry on the lattice in 1982 immediately after the no - go theorem of nielsen and ninomiya @xcite . in its simplest form",
    "the gw relation reads @xmath94 or , equivalently ( if @xmath95 has no zero modes ) @xmath96 although the propagator @xmath97 does not anticommute with @xmath98 the violation is a contact @xmath99 term only .",
    "it is expected and is really so that the gw relation implies chiral symmetry on physical predictions@xcite .",
    "( [ 13.1 ] ) is a non - linear relation for @xmath95 .",
    "it is clear intuitively and has been shown rigorously@xcite that the solution can not be ultralocal , it has a tail . on the other hand , a physically interesting solution should be _ local _ , which means that this tail of @xmath95 should decay faster than the signal at physical distances in correlation functions @xmath100 where @xmath101(cut - off ) .    since no solution to the gw relation eq .",
    "( [ 13.1 ] ) was found in the presence of gauge fields , the idea was soon after its birth abandoned .",
    "the first lattice regularization of fermions with chiral symmetry , the domain wall fermions@xcite and the related overlap construction@xcite followed a different path and seemed to be unrelated to the gw relation .    following the observation that the fixed - point dirac operator satisfies the gw relation@xcite the interest turned to this general formulation again .",
    "the gw relation is a powerful theoretical tool .",
    "its immediate consequence is the index theorem on the lattice @xcite and it implies the existence of an exact chiral symmetry transformation@xcite .",
    "the observation that the overlap dirac operator satisfies the gw relation connected the domain wall approach to this general formulation@xcite .    as the previously discussed @xmath0 studies illustrate , domain wall and , to a lesser extent ,",
    "overlap fermions are used today in large scale quenched simulations in problems , where chiral symmetry plays an important role@xcite .",
    "the fixed - point gauge and dirac actions are defined by classical equations@xcite .",
    "these equations can be solved numerically in an iterative way which is , however , far too expensive in a stochastic calculation .",
    "a parametrization in terms of a finite number of operators is unavoidable .",
    "this can be done quite effectively and the dirac operator obtained this way performs well in different test runs @xcite . an alternative way to fix the couplings in a parametrized dirac operator is a systematic expansion of the gw equation itself@xcite . for test results on this action and for comparison with other formulations ,",
    "see@xcite .",
    "the new chiral symmetric actions allow to investigate the role of topological excitations in the qcd vacuum .",
    "it was convincingly demonstrated in several contributions at this conference that an instanton dominated picture of low eigenmodes of the dirac operator is consistent : the local peaks in these eigenmodes are dominantly chiral @xcite .",
    "such a study is hardly possible with wilson fermions @xcite .",
    "chiral symmetric dirac operators have nice theoretical properties including the absence of exceptional configurations and @xmath102 improvement in spectroscopy .",
    "they are , however , expensive to simulate .",
    "the first studies on spectroscopy are exploratory @xcite . from these works",
    "it is obvious that light hadron spectroscopy becomes much cleaner : quark mass tuning and long chiral extrapolations are not needed , topology is well defined and operator renormalization is significantly simplified .",
    "the first quantitative results confirm that there are no unexpected , hidden problems with this regularization of qcd .",
    "simulations in the schwinger model@xcite strengthen this conclusion .",
    "there are problems , like the fermion condensate , where a chiral symmetric action is a prerequisite for a quantitative study . the quark condensate , or more precisely , the leading low energy constant @xmath103 in the chiral lagrangian , has been calculated by several groups using different actions and methods@xcite .",
    "the results are consistent and scatter around @xmath104 with a few percent statistical error . since no continuum extrapolation is done yet , the systematical error is unknown .",
    "as mentioned before , eq .",
    "( [ 13.1 ] ) implies exact symmetry under the transformation@xcite @xmath105 @xmath106 , which is a sort of smeared @xmath98 transformation .",
    "the action is also invariant under a singlet chiral transformation , but the fermion measure is not ( notice that the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ 17.1 ] ) is gauge field dependent ) leading to the correct anomalous ward identity @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the topological charge , while @xmath109 is the fermionic path integral on a fixed gauge field configuration @xmath110 .    the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ 17.1 ] ) is asymmetric on @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and so are the left / right projectors also @xcite .",
    "@xmath113 where @xmath114 @xmath115 the fermion action falls into @xmath116 and @xmath117 parts as in the formal continuum @xmath118 eqs .",
    "( [ 17.3],[18.1],[18.2 ] ) are the first , almost trivial steps in a highly complex construction which led to a breakthrough concerning chiral gauge theories@xcite . for anomaly free complex representations for @xmath119 , or @xmath120 gauge groups the theory is constructed non - perturbatively@xcite , for a general compact group it is constructed to all orders of pt@xcite .    at present , chiral gauge theories obtained this way have a certain ambiguity which i would like to discuss briefly . a normalization factor ( absolute value and phase ) in @xmath121 , where @xmath121 is the partition function of the theory in the topological sector with charge @xmath122 , is left undetermined .",
    "this is an unsatisfactory situation since , among others , it leaves the magnitude of fermion violating processes undetermined .    in a recent paper@xcite h. suzuki considered weyl fermions in a real representation of the gauge group .",
    "he demonstrated that this weyl fermion is equivalent to a mayorana ( @xmath123 symmetric ) fermion on the lattice , like in the continuum .",
    "based on this observation suzuki suggested a natural relative normalization of different topological sectors for weyl fermions in _ complex _ representations .",
    "the topological susceptibility @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the topological charge density and @xmath126 .",
    "this quantity is related to one of the fanciest features of qcd , like the @xmath119 problem , the axial anomaly and their interplay with topology .",
    "the topological susceptibility @xmath127 calculated in quenched qcd ( i.e. over configurations generated with the yang - mills action ) enters the witten - veneziano relation@xcite @xmath128 in the chiral limit . in full qcd , configurations with non - zero topological charge @xmath122 are suppressed in the chiral limit by the fermion determinant . the leading correction to",
    "the chiral limit reads @xcite @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the quark condensate ( in our normalization @xmath67mev in nature ) . for a recent brief review on the history around these relations ,",
    "see @xcite , while for a recent summary on numerical simulations of @xmath127 i refer to@xcite . here",
    "i would like to mention some recent developments only .    on the theoretical side",
    "the gw formulation ( which has exact @xmath131 symmetry with the proper @xmath119 anomaly and the index theorem ) allows a clean derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ 23.1],[23.2 ] ) on the lattice . under the standard dynamical assumptions (",
    "chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and the @xmath132 remains heavy ) eq .",
    "( [ 23.2 ] ) was derived in@xcite . in a recent paper",
    "the witten - veneziano formula was also reproduced on the lattice@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice the analogies between the form of eqs .",
    "( [ 23.1],[23.2 ] ) and also in the steps of derivation .",
    "although the @xmath132 mass is due to a hard symmetry breaking ( anomaly ) , it is switched off by the @xmath133 limit similarly as the soft breaking @xmath134 is switched off in the chiral limit .",
    "data : wilson fermions@xcite(open diamond ) , clover fermions@xcite(open circle ) , staggered fermions with smeared link operator@xcite(filled symbols ) , clover fermions with rg improved action@xcite(burst ) . ]    on the numerical side , the quenched topological susceptibility seems to settle down at a value @xmath135 with an estimated @xmath136 error on @xmath127@xcite .",
    "a specialty of the topological susceptibility is that its cut - off effects depend not only on the action but also on the details of the calculation ( type and number of cooling steps ) if non - chiral symmetric actions with a field theoretic definition of @xmath122 are used .",
    "the value above compares reasonably with eq .",
    "( [ 23.1 ] ) if @xmath137 numbers are inserted on the r.h.s ..",
    "@xmath137 seems to be close to the @xmath138 limit which is also supported by a recent numerical study of the string tension , glue ball masses and @xmath127 in @xmath139@xcite .",
    "the numerical analysis becomes cleaner if chiral symmetric actions are simulated .",
    "only preliminary results are available@xcite .",
    "the topological susceptibility of qcd is , presumably the best place to see , how sea quarks turn yang - mills gauge theory in full qcd . as eq .",
    "( [ 23.2 ] ) shows , the effect should be striking : the susceptibility @xmath81 goes to zero in the chiral limit .",
    "the early results@xcite appear controversial .",
    "the authors in ref.@xcite argue that the cut - off effects are responsible for the confusing results , in particular , chiral symmetry violation for wilson type fermions and flavor symmetry violation for staggered fermions@xcite at large lattice spacings .",
    "the situation is expected to become better at smaller @xmath140 , with improved actions , or improved topological charge operators .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by the @xmath141 cp - pacs@xcite and by the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .    fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] is a compilation@xcite of staggered , wilson and clover data with @xmath141 at @xmath142 , where , with the exception of the sesam data@xcite , either the action , or the operator is improved .",
    "the effect of dynamical fermions is seen clearly and the data are consistent with @xmath143 as @xmath144 . on the other hand ,",
    "remaining discretization errors might be significant and the behavior of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath145 might look differently in the continuum limit@xcite .",
    "numerical data in asymptotically free theories are standardly extrapolated to the continuum using symanzik s results@xcite valid in every order of perturbation theory .",
    "accordingly , in a bosonic theory the leading cut - off effect is quadratic @xmath146 modified by logarithms .",
    "results in the @xmath147 non - linear sigma model show that either non - perturbative effects invalidate this expectation , or the onset of leading behavior happens at very large correlation lengths only@xcite . in fig .",
