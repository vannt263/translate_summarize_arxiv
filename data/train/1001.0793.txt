    "determining the theoretical limits of lossy compression schemes are of significant interest .",
    "results in lossy source coding have applications in multiple domains including multimedia communication & storage , image processing and distributed processing over sensor networks .",
    "a single representation for a single source is today a fairly well established field of research @xcite . when multiple representations and/or sources are involved , there are only a limited set of exact results known .",
    "the lossless compression of correlated sources , studied in @xcite by slepian and wolf , is one of the early success stories in this domain .",
    "subsequently , the gaussian two - terminal multiple description ( md ) rate region was characterized in @xcite .",
    "more recently , many new results have emerged in the field of gaussian multiterminal source coding @xcite , @xcite . in particular , the gaussian ceo problem was studied in @xcite and @xcite , where the sum rate and the entire rate region were characterized .",
    "@xcite provides a simplified converse argument for the sum rate .",
    "the rate region of the gaussian two - encoder problem was characterized in @xcite .",
    "we consider a version of the ceo problem in which the ceo can `` vacation . ''",
    "the setup is described by figure 1 .",
    "we have a single source @xmath0 , and two corrupted versions of the source @xmath1 and @xmath2 are available at the two encoders in the system .",
    "the encoders wish to communicate information about @xmath0 to a decoder , i.e. , the ceo , which they accomplish by each sending a data packet at time 1 and another at time 2",
    ". the ceo may be on vacation during time 1 , time 2 , neither , or both , and she can not receive data packets when she is vacationing .",
    "we assume that the ceo s holiday schedule is unknown to the encoders .",
    "if the ceo works during time 1 and vacations during time 2 , she expects to reproduce the source @xmath0 to distortion @xmath3 .",
    "likewise , if she works during time 2 and vacations during time 1 , she expects to reproduce @xmath0 to distortion @xmath4 .",
    "if the ceo eschews vacation and works during both periods , then she expects to reproduce @xmath0 to distortion @xmath5 . for convenience ,",
    "we represent the three vacation states of the ceo by three separate receivers in figure 1 .",
    "details on the system model and problem at hand are presented in section [ sec : probdef ] .",
    "this problem generalizes both the ceo problem , by omitting the transmission at time 2 , and the md problem , by omitting the noises @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we note that a related problem is considered in @xcite , which also generalizes both ceo and md .",
    "however , unlike the other problem formulation , we are able to obtain a more conclusive sum rate result .",
    "the vacationing - ceo problem arises in multicast networks in which receivers enter and depart the systems at arbitrary times .",
    "see @xcite for additional discussion of this connection .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we state the problem and describe the main result of the paper , which characterizes the sum rate of the gaussian problem with ceo vacations . in section [ sec : ach ] , we show that the sum rate described in section [ sec : probdef ] is achievable , and in section [ sec : ob ] , we provide a lower bound for the gaussian vacationing - ceo problem .",
    "this lower bound combines converse techniques developed individually for the md problem  @xcite and the ceo problem  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is interesting to note that our lower bound requires the use of _ both _ converse techniques for the ceo problem , as neither alone is sufficient . in section [ sec :",
    "comp ] , we establish the equivalence of the achievable sum rate and the lower bound on it , thus proving the main result of the paper .",
