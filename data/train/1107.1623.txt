    "collective motion of living organisms , such as exhibited by bird flocks , fish schools or insect swarms is an ubiquitous and fascinating self- organization phenomenon , which has attracted scientists with very different backgrounds , ranging from biology and ecology to mathematics , physics and engineering .",
    "the understanding of grouping and collective behavior is essential for our understanding of large scale dynamics of populations @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction of individuals leading to the onset of collective motion of up to thousands or millions of individuals , does not only have a strong impact on dispersal and migration of entire populations , but poses also interesting theoretical questions about modelling and the corresponding mathematical description of such ecological systems @xcite .",
    "the individual based  or `` langragian ''  approach provides a natural framework for a detailed description of individual dynamics in terms of ( stochastic ) equations of motion .",
    "the downside of the approach is the difficulty to obtain analytical results on the behavior of many interacting individuals .",
    "thus , the approach often relies on extensive numerical simulations , which make it difficult to gain a profound understanding of the general dynamical behavior of the system . furthermore , despite the continuous progress in the development and application of novel computational techniques , large scale simulation of individual based model on ecological length and time scales are still extremely expensive in terms of computational time .",
    "thus , at the level of populations , it seems more reasonable to take the `` eulerian '' viewpoint , where the behavior of the ecological system is described by partial differential equations governing the dynamics of mean field observables such as the population density , which may even allow us to obtain analytical results .",
    "it is obvious that the different viewpoints are not independent : populations consist of individuals ; their dynamics origin from individual behavior .",
    "the question is , whether , for a given microscopic individual based model , a corresponding macroscopic or mean - field description can be derived .",
    "depending on the complexity of the individual based model this might be not feasible , but for simple models which focus on few essential mechanisms , it is possible to establish a direct link between the two levels of description .    here , starting from a simple individual based model of collective motion , we will derive systematically the corresponding mean - field equations .",
    "we consider a model of individuals interacting only via a velocity - alignment interaction , which tends to harmonize the speeds and directions of motion of neighboring individuals .",
    "the description of individuals dynamics is based on the concept of so - called active brownian particles , which can be described by stochastic equations of motion with a velocity - dependent friction function which , depending on the velocity , may also assume negative values @xcite .",
    "thus , in the following we will refer to individuals as `` particles '' or `` agents '' .",
    "two types of velocity alignment can be distinguished : particles with nematic interaction align either parallel or anti parallel , whereas a polar interaction acts strictly towards parallel alignment of individual velocity vectors ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the velocity - alignment interaction studied here is polar @xcite and can be seen as a continuous version of the well known vicsek - model @xcite .",
    "it reduces for pairwise interaction of self - propelled particles with constant speed to the polar - alignment model studied by @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a number of publication on the coarse - grained description of self - propelled particles with velocity alignment .",
    "the ansatz proposed by @xcite is based on the formulation of mesoscopic equations of motion for the density and velocity fields using symmetry and conservation laws ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite derived hydrodynamic equations of interacting self - propelled particles by a boltzmann approach .",
    "an alternative derivation of kinetic equations for the vicsek model , was presented by @xcite .",
    "ihle derives the corresponding transport coefficients by taking into account multiparticle collisions and shows that the corresponding results are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the vicsek model .",
    "et al . _ as well as",
    "ihle assume in their derivations of coarse - grained description to be close to the critical point for the onset of collective motion ( small center of mass velocity ) .    here , in contrast to the vicsek model , we consider individual dynamics in terms of stochastic differential equation ( langevin equation ) with continuous time .",
    "we do not assume a constant speed or restrict to the vicinity of the critical point for the onset of collective motion .",
    "the mean field equations are derived in a systematic way starting from the microscopic langevin equations by formulating the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the probability density . hereby , we consider directly multi - individual interactions as each individual couples to the mean velocity of its neighbours .",
    "in addition to the density and velocity fields , we consider explicitly the effective temperature field of the active brownian particle gas . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the impact of different ( nonlinear ) velocity - dependent friction functions on the onset of collective motion .",
    "although the kinetic theory derived in this paper , can in principle be used to analyze the spatially inhomogeneous solutions , we restrict ourselves here to the discussion of the spatially homogeneous case",
    ". please note that recent publications show the instability of the homogeneous solution in large systems with short - ranged velocity alignment @xcite .",
    "thus , the results presented here can not be generalized to the so - called thermodynamic limit with local interactions .",
    "the derivation of the kinetic theory is based on the formulation of moment equations of the corresponding probability distribution .",
    "this approach has been employed , for example , by @xcite to analyze the behavior of a quasi one - dimensional granular system .",
    "@xcite used it to analyze the mean field of non - interacting active particles with rayleigh - helmholtz friction .",
    "only recently , @xcite used the approach to analyze the collective motion of active particles in one spatial dimension .    in general , for a system far from equilibrium",
    "the probability distribution is not gaussian and a correct description requires infinitely many moments ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "thus , depending on the detailed model , it may be necessary to neglect higher moments in order to obtain a closure of the system of moment equations .",
    "the approximation of a non - gaussian probability distribution by a finite number of moments may lead to unphysical behavior , such as negative values or artificial oscillations of the ( approximated ) probability distribution .",
    "therefore , we will compare our analytical results to numerical simulations of the microscopic system .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 individuals with mass @xmath1 in two spatial dimensions . for simplicity , we neglect the finite size of individuals and consider them to be point - like active brownian particles .",
    "the evolution of the particle positions @xmath2 and velocities @xmath3 is described by the following set of stochastic equations of motion ( @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "is a friction / propulsion force , which describes the deterministic velocity dynamics of non - interacting active particles .",
    "this velocity - dependent friction is negative at low speeds , which leads to an acceleration of the individual . as a consequence",
    "an individual has a preferred speed different from zero . in the following sections",
    ", we will discuss active particles with two different velocity - dependent friction functions : the nonlinear rayleigh - helmholtz friction @xcite , as well as a variant of the linear schienbein - gruler friction @xcite .",

    "fig : scheme_va ] ) . for solitary particles , with no neighbors , or a system in a perfectly ordered state where all particles move with exactly the same velocity , the alignment force vanishes as @xmath10 . on the other hand , for a large number of neighbors @xmath15 moving with random velocities ( disordered state ) , the mean velocity vanishes @xmath16 and the velocity alignment force leads to an additional `` social '' friction @xmath17 .    the last term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "accounts for is stochastic force , which introduces a random component into the motion of each individual .",

    "the effect appears for both ordered and disordered state as well as for global and local coupling .",

    "furthermore , as in the case of rayleigh - helmholtz friction , the temperature components parallel and perpendicular to the direction of motion are not equal , in contrast to the predictions of the mean field theory . whereas the perpendicular component agrees well with the theoretical prediction of @xmath199 , we observe in general smaller values of the parallel component .",

    "on the other hand , the approximations made in the derivation of the mean field theory , may result for some cases in deviations between the analytical predictions and numerics , which can be understood from a detailed analysis .",

    "thus , in this limiting case the velocity alignment acts only on the effective temperature of the active brownian particle gas .",
    "it suppresses the individuals fluctuations around the current mean velocity leading to the stabilization of the ordered state with finite mean field velocity @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the mean velocity and its fluctuation in the collective motion of locusts .",
    "based on the observed dependence of mean velocity fluctuations they suggested that this implies state dependent fluctuations ( multiplicative noise ) on the level of individuals . in our case",

    "the stationary values show a strong dependence of @xmath168 on the corresponding mean velocity  increasing @xmath168 with decreasing@xmath209  even in the absence of any multiplicative noise in the dynamics of individuals .",
    "this is a consequence of the nonlinear fokker - planck equation governing the dynamics of the probability distribution and the resulting effective state - dependent velocity potential .",
    "thus our results suggest that in biological systems extreme caution should be taken when deducing individual behavior of interacting agents based on mean field measurements , and that there might exist other alternative explanation of the observed mean field dynamics of locusts than the suggested `` inherent noise '' @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that for the homogeneous case in the limit of large coupling @xmath129 , where the impact of the individual speed dynamics ( friction function ) in the temperature equations becomes negligible , the scaling of the mean speed as order parameter close to the critical noise reads : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    thus , in this limit the onset of collective motion in a spatially homogeneous system takes place via a continuous ( second - order ) phase transition , irrespective on the details of the velocity dynamics .",
    "this result agrees also with previous results obtained for a system of self - propelled particles with constant speed @xcite .    in one dimension",
    "it was shown , that for weak coupling ( low @xmath129 ) and a nonlinear reyleigh - helmholtz friction function , bistability of the ordered and disordered state is possible @xcite .",
    "the corresponding mean field theory predicts a discontinuous transition from an initially ordered state of collective motion to the disordered state with increasing noise intensity for nonlinear friction functions .",
    "but the results of direct large - scale numerical simulations of the individual based model reveal deviations from the predicted behavior",
    ".    a possible explanation could be an extremely small basin of attraction of the disordered solution in the respective parameter region and the always present finite fluctuations in langevin simulations ( largest system studied with global coupling : @xmath211 ) .",
    "but a more probable cause , is the approximation of the non - gaussian probability distribution by a finite number of moments , and the corresponding unresolved impact of higher order fluctuations on the stability and bifurcation behavior of the system , which represents an interesting theoretical challenge for the future .",
    "please note that a gaussian approximation with @xmath212 offers an alternative closure of moment equations for nonlinear friction function , but is unsuitable for the analysis of the disordered state at vanishing noise @xmath18 as it would imply also a vanishing temperature , which for active particles is certainly not the case .",
    "our kinetic equations can also be used to analyze the stability of the spatially homogeneous state with respect to spatial perturbations . a corresponding instability in large scale",
    "collective motion has been predicted from the analysis of hydrodynamic equations of self - propelled particle systems @xcite and large density fluctuations were also reported in numerical studies @xcite .",
    "similar density inhomogeneities can be observed in numerical simulations of our model for @xmath213 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots_va ] .",
    "thus , we should emphasize that our results for the homogeneous case hold strictly speaking only in the limit of global coupling and only as an approximation for local coupling , where the interaction range is not to small @xmath52 in comparison to the system size @xmath196 .",
    "the approach presented in this paper , can be applied also to other swarming models , such as , the `` escape & pursuit '' model introduced recently by the authors @xcite .",
    "the formulation of kinetic equations for interacting agents allow to address the question of how swarming affects population dynamics , in particular the population dispersal , at ecological length scales . a velocity - alignment interaction between individuals may result in long range ordered collective motion , which corresponds to large scale population fluxes , and therefore the population dynamics",
    "can not be described by simple diffusion equations .",
    "we believe that the general approach of formulating individual based models in terms of stochastic differential equations and the derivation of macroscopic equations based on the corresponding nonlinear fokker - planck equation can be very useful to address many different problems of interacting agents in ecology .",
