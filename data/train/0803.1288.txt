    "the recently discovered@xcite iron - based superconducting oxides with a transition temperature as high as 55k has attracted much attention . as long as a new superconductor",
    "is discovered , the superconducting mechanism is urgent to be understood and the transition temperature is hoped to be enhanced .",
    "thus the fundamental parameters , such as the upper critical field @xmath3 , charge carrier density and its type , the electron scattering mechanism , etc , are very important to identify the superconducting mechanism .",
    "it is well perceived that the normal state properties , such as the hall effect and magnetoresistance , are very important to learn about the electronic scattering feature which is intimately related to the mechanism of a superconductor .",
    "for example , the superlinear temperature dependence of the normal state resistivity and the clear temperature dependence of hall coefficient in wide temperature region in cuprate superconductors have been considered as two important anomalous properties which suggest the unusual scattering process beyond the electron - phonon scattering . in this paper",
    "we report the successful fabrication of this material with a two - step method , and the measurements on the resistive transition under different magnetic fields , hall effect and magnetoresistance . by analyzing the data we obtained fresh information about the upper critical field , the charge carrier density and its type , as well as the scattering times etc .",
    "almost all main peaks can be indexed by a tetragonal structure with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the tiny peaks marked by asterisks are from the impurity phase , perhaps feas.,width=302 ]    the polycrystalline samples were synthesized by using a two - step solid state reaction method .",
    "first the starting materials fe powder ( purity 99.95% ) and as grains ( purity 99.99% ) were mixed in 1:1 ratio , ground and pressed into a pellet shape .",
    "then it was sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and followed by heat treating at 700@xmath9c for 10 hours .",
    "the resultant pellet was smashed and ground together with the laf@xmath10 powder ( purity 99.95% ) , la@xmath11o@xmath10 powder ( purity 99.9% ) and grains of la ( purity 99.99% ) in stoichiometry as the formula lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 .",
    "again it was pressed into a pellet and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and burned at about 940@xmath9c for 2 hours , followed by a heat treating at 1150@xmath9c for 48 hours .",
    "then it was cooled down slowly to room temperature . since a little amount of f may escape during the second step fabrication , in the formula for our sample , we use @xmath12 as the possible concentration of f. in figure .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the x - ray diffraction patterns for the sample lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 .",
    "almost all main peaks can be indexed by a tetragonal structure with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the dominant component is from lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 with only tiny peaks in the same scale as appeared in the data of the original paper@xcite .",
    "this tiny amount of second phase , perhaps from feas , together with the granular behavior of the samples , may give some influence on the zero resistance point , but they should not give any obvious influence on the upper critical field and the normal state properties .",
    "the resistance and hall effect measurements were done in a physical property measurement system ( quantum design , ppms ) with magnetic field up to 9@xmath5 t .",
    "the six - lead method was used in the measurement on the longitudinal and the transverse resistivity at the same time .",
    "the resistance was measured by either sweeping magnetic field at a fixed temperature or sweeping temperature at a fixed field .",
    "the temperature stabilization was better than @xmath13 and the resolution of the voltmeter was better than 10@xmath5nv .      in figure .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present the temperature dependence of resistivity for the lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 sample under different magnetic fields .",
    "one can see that the onset transition point shifts with the magnetic field weakly , but the zero resistance point shifts more quickly to lower temperatures .",
    "this is understandable since the latter is determined by the weak links between the grains as well as the vortex flow behavior , while the former is controlled by the upper critical field of the individual grains .",
    "this allows to determine the upper critical field of this material .",
    "however , we should mention that the upper critical field determined in this way reflects mainly the situation of @xmath14-plane since the cooper pairs within the grains with this configuration will last to the highest field compared to other grains . taking the onset point of the transition as the upper critical field point @xmath15 means that almost all cooper pairs are broken at this temperature and magnetic field . by taking a criterion of @xmath16 ( referenced by the normal state resistivity @xmath17 marked by the dashed line in figure .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) we can determine the upper critical field @xmath2 and shown in figure .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "it is seen that the slope of @xmath2 near @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 is about @xmath20t / k . by using the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) formula@xcite",
    "the value of zero temperature upper critical field @xmath21 can be estimated through : @xmath22 taking @xmath23k , we get @xmath24 roughly",
    ". we can also determine the @xmath3 by using the formula based on the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equation .",
    "in the gl theory , it is known that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the flux quanta , @xmath28 the coherence length , @xmath29 the reduced temperature , thus one has @xmath30 although the gl theory is specially applicable near @xmath18 , above equation has been proved to be satisfied in much wider temperature regime@xcite .",
    "we thus use above equation to fit our data and show them as the solid line in figure .",
    "the zero temperature upper critical fields @xmath31 determined in this way is @xmath32 t .",
    "this value is a bit higher than that obtained in using the whh formula .",
    "we note that a recent result reported that the whh approximation could not be simply applied in this material@xcite , and even the @xmath31 is affected by the multiband property@xcite .",
    "however our result can give a rough magnitude of @xmath31 because of the limit of magnetic field .",
    "f@xmath1 bulk sample under different magnetic fields .",
    "the onset transition point defined by @xmath16 shifts with the magnetic field weakly .",
    "the dashed line indicates the extrapolation of the normal state resistivity .",
    ", width=302 ]     shown by the open circles .",
    "the red solid line shows the theoretical curve based on the gl theory ( eq .  [ eq2 ] ) . the magnetic onset transition point and the zero resistivity point are quite close to each other , which are shown by the open and filled squares , respectively . , width=302 ]      in figure .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the resistance transition of the sample at zero field in wide temperature region by open circles . from",
    "that we can get the zero resistance temperature at about 19@xmath5k , the onset temperature 28.9@xmath5k ( 99% of the normal state resistivity ) .",
    "the resistivity at 30@xmath5k is 0.133@xmath33 cm , while the residual resistance ratio @xmath34 is about 18.1 .",
    "this may indicate a good quality of the sample in our experiments .",
    "the general shape of the resistivity curve at this doping shows a very good metallic behavior .",
    "the inset shown in figure .",
    "[ fig4 ] gives the zero field cooled and also the field cooled dc magnetization of the sample at 20@xmath5oe .",
    "the onset critical temperature by magnetic measurement is about 24@xmath5k ( see by an enlarged view ) , which is corresponding to the middle transition point of resistance .",

    ", the fitting curve deviates clealy from the data .",
    "the inset shows the temperature dependence of dc magnetization for the zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) at @xmath38oe.,width=302 ]    magnetoresistance is a very powerful tool to investigate the electronic scattering process and the information about the fermi surface .",
    "for example , in mgb@xmath11 , a large magnetoresistance ( mr ) was found which is closely related to the multiband property.@xcite for this new superconductor , we also measured and found a clear mr . in figure .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) we present field dependence of the mr ratio , i.e. , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the resistivity , @xmath41 is the resistivity at zero field , and @xmath42 .",
    "one can see that the mr is about 2.2% at 40@xmath5k and 9@xmath5 t for this sample .",
    "this ratio is one order of magnitude smaller than mgb@xmath11 with the same @xmath43 .",
    "however , considering that the sample is a polycrystalline sample , the mr effect may be weakened by mixing the transport components with the magnetic field along different directions of the crystallographic axes . for a single band metal with a symmetric fermi surface ,",
    "kohler s law is normally obeyed .",
    "kohler s law@xcite shows that the magnetoresistance @xmath39 measured at different temperatures should be scalable with the variable @xmath44 . for mgb@xmath11",
    ", kohlerslaw is not obeyed because of the multiband property.@xcite we also do scaling based on kohlerslaw for this sample , the result is shown in figure .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( b ) .",
    "clearly , the data measured at different temperatures do not overlap and kohlerslaw is violated for this material .",
    "this discrepancy may suggest that in this new material there may be multiband effect or other exotic scattering , such as spin scattering which depends on the magnetic field .",
    "however , the mr in this sample do show some specialty . for two - band or multiband materials with weak mr ,",
    "the mr ratios could be well described by the expression @xmath45 in the low field region .",
    "this is because the contribution of the higher order even terms of @xmath46 could be omitted at a low field ( the odd terms are absent here according to the boltzmann equation for electronic transport ) .",
    "this effect is also found in nbse@xmath11 which has a complex fermi surface structure.@xcite it was reported that both lafeaso@xcite and lafepo@xcite have five orbitals crossing the fermi level , and fermi surfaces with both electron and hole type band are present . in this sense , the anomalies mentioned above in the present new superconductor may also be induced by multiband effect together with complex fermi surfaces . on single crystal samples , when the field is along @xmath47-axis , a stronger in - plane magnetoresistance is expected .     at different temperatures",
    "one can see that the mr decreases rapidly when the temperature is increased . above about 250@xmath5k ,",
    "the mr becomes very weak .",
    "( b ) kohler plot for the sample at different temperatures , and kohler s rule is not obeyed.,width=302 ]      for a normal metal with fermi liquid feature , the hall coefficient is a constant versus temperature .",
    "however , this situation is changed for a multiband material or a sample with non - fermi liquid behavior , such as the cuprate superconductors .",
    "we also do the hall effect measurement for this sample . as shown in figure .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the transverse resistivity remains negative at all temperatures above the critical temperature , indicating that the electric transport is dominated by electron - like charge carriers , not hole - like ones . for a clean sample ,",
    "the nonlinear hall effect is also a sign of multiband , and the effect is weaker in dirtier samples . @xcite in our measurements , all curves shown in figure .",
    "[ fig6 ] have good linearity versus the magnetic field which may be caused by the disorders within the sample . from this set of data ,",
    "the hall coefficient @xmath48 is determined and shown in figure .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( a ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath4 is almost a constant below about 250@xmath5k , and there is a kink at about 150@xmath5k considering the small error showing in the figure .",
    "the charge carrier density calculated by @xmath49 is about @xmath50 which is very close to the cuprate superconductors .",
    "this may imply that the superfluid density in this superconductor is also very diluted , as suggested by a recent theoretical proposal.@xcite however , it should be noted that the hall coefficient @xmath4 could not be simply expressed as @xmath51 for a multiband material ,",
    "@xcite so it needs further consideration if multiband property dominates the electric transport . from figure .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the transverse resistivity curves almost overlap at @xmath52k .",
    "however at the temperature above 250@xmath5k , the absolute value of the slope , i.e. , the hall coefficient @xmath4 decreases quickly . as shown in figure .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , @xmath4 behaves a little different from another recent work on la(o@xmath0f@xmath53)feas.@xcite in our sample , @xmath4 shows a weak @xmath54 dependence at the temperature below 225@xmath5k ; while at @xmath55k , the absolute value of @xmath4 has a rapid decrease .",
    "this is similar to the situation of mgcni@xmath10@xcite , which may be caused by the exotic scattering when a ferromagnetic fluctuation is present .",
    "the temperature dependent hall coefficient also tells us that either the multiband effect or some unusual scattering process may be involved in the electron conduction in the material .",
    "versus the magnetic field @xmath46 at different temperatures .",
    "the curves at the temperatures below 250@xmath5k have similar behaviors , while at temperatures above that temperature , the absolute values of slopes have a sudden decrease.,width=302 ]    in order to reveal an anomalous behavior at about 230@xmath5k , here we make a further discussion .",
    "the differential of the @xmath56 curve shown in figure .",
    "[ fig4 ] is given in figure .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( b ) .",
    "it is clear that there is a maximum value at about 240@xmath5k of the differential slope @xmath57 .",
    "this is similar to the situation reported in the underdoped laofeas sample , @xcite where they found a clear kink point of resistivity and marked the temperature point as @xmath58 . in our present sample ,",
    "this kink is absent , but the resistivity shows a weak downward feature around 240@xmath5k , as evidenced by a bump on the curve of @xmath57 vs. @xmath54 .",
    "therefore the anomaly at about 240@xmath5k in our sample may be related to the situation at @xmath58 in the original paper@xcite .",
    "we also try to fit the normal state @xmath56 curve with the formula @xmath35 . as shown in figure .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the curve below 240@xmath5k could be well fitted and the fitting results give values of @xmath37 and @xmath59 cm .",
    "however , just from this temperature and above , the fitting curve starts deviating from the data . as shown in figure .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( c ) , there is also a sudden decrease of mr at the temperature of 240@xmath5k .",
    "the origin of this anomaly at about 230@xmath5k certainly needs further consideration .",
    "curve ( b ) , and the magnetoresistance ratio at 9@xmath5 t ( c ) .",
    "there are obvious turning point at about 230@xmath5 for both of the curves shown in ( a ) and ( b ) , while the magnetoresistance shows a sudden decrease in that point.,width=302 ]    so far , a weak magnetic signal has been measured in the sample in the normal state , which is exactly the same as that reported in the original paper by kamihara et al.@xcite .",
    "magnetic measurements show that this magnetic signal even has a small hysteresis in low field region . at this moment",
    ", we do nt know whether this magnetic signal is due to an intrinsic feature of the lafeaso phase , or is due to the second tiny impure phase .",
    "if the former is right , some exotic scattering , like the electron - magnon scattering or magnetic skew scattering would exist .",
    "this deserves a further study on improved samples .",
    "our present investigation will thus provide a basic platform for the future studies .",
    "in summary , the temperature dependence of resistivity under different magnetic fields , the magnetoresistance and hall coefficient have been measured in the newly found layered superconductor lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 at zero temperature is obtained roughly to be about 50 tesla .",
    "the hall coefficient is negative indicating that the electron - like charge carriers dominate the electrical transport .",
    "the charge carrier density at 100@xmath5k is about @xmath6 manifesting that the superconductor may have a diluted superfluid , as in cuprate superconductors .",
    "the hall coefficient @xmath4 has a weak temperature dependence below 230@xmath5k , but it rises more rapidly above that temperature . at the similar temperature",
    "the magnetoresistance becomes very small , together with a maximum of the differential of the resistivity curve @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath60 curve at low temperature could be fitted by @xmath35 with @xmath37 .",
    "kohler s law is clearly violated in all temperature region .",
    "these observations can be explained by the multi - band effect or some exotic scattering , like the scattering with magnetic moments or in presence of weak magnetic correlation .",
