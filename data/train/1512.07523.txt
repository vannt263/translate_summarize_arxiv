    "[ thm:24 ] let @xmath54 be the operator given either by or by and assume that @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",

    "the estimate from theorem [ thm:24 ] can be deduced from inequality or by appealing to the caldern transference principle .",
    "furthermore , theorem [ thm:24 ] with @xmath62 can be thought as an extension of cotlar s ergodic theorem ( see @xcite ) , which states that for every @xmath37-finite measure space @xmath63 with an invertible and a measure preserving transformation @xmath64 the limit @xmath65 exists @xmath60-almost everywhere on @xmath61 for every @xmath66 with @xmath1 .",
    "the classical strategy for handling pointwise convergence problems requires @xmath67 boundedness for the corresponding maximal function , reducing the matters to proving pointwise convergence for a dense class of @xmath67 functions .",
    "however , establishing pointwise convergence on a dense class can be a quite challenging problem .",
    "this is the case for bourgain s averaging operator along the squares .",
    "fortunately in @xcite , he was able to circumvent this issue for the operators @xmath68 , in the one dimensional case @xmath69 , by controlling their oscillation seminorm . given a lacunary sequence @xmath70 , the oscillation seminorm for a sequence @xmath71 of complex numbers is defined by @xmath72 bourgain deduced pointwise convergence on @xmath73 for the operators @xmath74 by proving , roughly , that there are constants @xmath75 and @xmath76 such that for all @xmath77 @xmath78    variational estimates have been the subject of many papers , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "our motivation to study @xmath2-variational seminorms is threefold .",
    "firstly , for any sequence of functions @xmath79 , if for some @xmath80 @xmath81 then the limit @xmath82 exists .",
    "secondly , @xmath26 s control the supremum norm .",
    "indeed , for any @xmath83 we have the pointwise estimate @xmath84 furthermore , for any @xmath85 by hlder s inequality we have @xmath86    the variational estimates for bourgain s averaging operator with @xmath69 , have recently been extensively studied , while only partial results were obtained .",
    "namely , krause @xcite showed inequality for @xmath1 and @xmath87 .",
    "zorin - kranich @xcite showed with @xmath3 and @xmath1 in some vicinity of @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the degree of the polynomial .",
    "their proofs were based on variational estimates of the famous bourgain s logarithmic lemma provided by nazarov , oberlin and thiele in @xcite , see also @xcite for some improvements . that was the main building block in their arguments .",
    "although the logarithmic lemma gives very nice @xmath91 results , it is generally very inefficient for @xmath92 .",
    "the reason , loosely speaking , is that it produces for @xmath93 a polynomial growth in norm unlike the acceptable logarithmic growth which one has for @xmath94 .",
    "therefore in this paper we introduce a different flexible approach based on a direct analysis of the multipliers associated with operators and , and instead of bourgain s logarithmic lemma we will apply a simple numerical inequality , see lemma [ lem:6 ] , which turns out to be a more appropriate tool in these problems with arithmetic flavor . this lemma is a variant of the crucial lemma 2.2 that we used in @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm:1 ] and theorem [ thm:4 ] , in view of inequality , will be based on separate estimates for long and short variational seminorms of the operators @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "we now describe the key points of our method in the case of averaging operator .",
    "assume , for simplicity , that @xmath97 and @xmath98 is a moment curve for some @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath100 be the multiplier associated with @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath101",
    ".    the estimates of long variations will be very much in spirit of the estimates of maximal functions associated with @xmath95 as we gave in @xcite .",
    "for this purpose as in @xcite we introduce an appropriate partition of unity which permits us to identify asymptotic or highly oscillatory behaviour of @xmath102 , corresponding respectively to the  major \" and  minor \" arcs .",
    "this distinction is based on the ideas of the circle method of hardy and littlewood .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath103 be a smooth cut - off function with a small support , fix @xmath104 and for each @xmath105 define projections @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a diagonal @xmath108 matrix with positive entries @xmath109 such that @xmath110 and @xmath111 for some family @xmath112 such that @xmath113 , we refer to the last subsection of section [ sec:3 ] for more detailed definitions .",
    "the projections @xmath114 will be critical in the further analysis , since @xmath115 where @xmath116 corresponds to the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath117 , whereas @xmath118 localizes the highly oscillatory part .",
    "for the last piece we can prove that @xmath119 these bounds can be deduced from a variant of weyl s inequality with logarithmic decay , see theorem [ thm:3 ] or @xcite , and the following inequality for @xmath1 , that goes back to ideas of ionescu and wainger , @xmath120 see theorem [ th:3 ] or @xcite and @xcite for more detailed expositions . for the proof of the estimate @xmath121",
    "we show that @xmath122 where @xmath123 with @xmath124 being the gaussian sum and @xmath125 being the continuous version of @xmath102 , see at the beginning of section [ sec:4 ] for relevant definitions .",
    "then the matters are reduced to proving that for each @xmath126 we have @xmath127 firstly , we prove for @xmath94 with bound @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is an exponent from the bound for the gaussian sums @xmath130 , and @xmath131 an arbitrary integer . secondly , for general @xmath93",
    "we obtain much worse bound @xmath132 . now interpolating the last bound with much better for @xmath94 we get the claim from , since @xmath131 can be arbitrarily large . to achieve both bounds we partition the @xmath26 in into two pieces @xmath133 and @xmath134 for some integer @xmath135 . the case for large scales",
    "@xmath134 follows by invoking the transference principle which allows us to control discrete @xmath136 norm of @xmath2-variations associated with multipliers from by the continuous @xmath137 norm of @xmath2-variations closely related with the multiplier @xmath125 , which is _ a priori _ bounded on @xmath138 .",
    "this is the place , and only place , where we are restricted to @xmath3 , and then obtain the growth of the constant @xmath139 in theorem [ thm:1 ] .",
    "the reason lies in application lpingle s inequality , ( see theorem [ thm:22 ] and theorem [ thm:23 ] in the appendix ) to bound @xmath140 norm .",
    "the case of small scales @xmath133 has different nature and some new ideas came up .",
    "an invaluable tool which surmounted complications occurring in @xcite and @xcite is a simple numerical inequality from lemma [ lem:6 ] yielding @xmath141 applying now theorem [ th:3 ] ( see also @xcite ) we shall show that @xmath142 norm of the inner square function on the right - hand side in is bounded by @xmath143 for each @xmath144 . consequently , we get the desired bound since there are @xmath145 elements .",
    "this illustrates roughly the scheme for long @xmath2-variations .    in order to attack short variations",
    "we will again exploit the partition of unity introduced above and obtain @xmath146 the last sum corresponds to the highly oscillatory behaviour of the multiplier @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , invoking inequality , weyl s inequality in theorem [ thm:3 ] and , we are able to prove that the last term in is bounded on @xmath142 , see section [ sec:5 ] .    to bound the first term in we introduce a tool reminiscent of the littlewood - paley theory .",
    "now as opposed to the continous theory , for discrete operators there is no known analogue of the square functions of littlewood - paley that give us decisive control of the operators in question .",
    "however as a start in this direction we consider in section [ sec:5 ] , ( see theorem [ thm:30 ] ) , the following family of projections : @xmath148 and using theorem [ th:3 ] we will be able to show that for each @xmath1 there is a constant @xmath75 such that @xmath149 uniformly in @xmath150 .",
    "estimate can be thought as a discrete counterpart of littlewood  paley inequality and is essential in our further purposes .",
    "thanks to we reduce the problem to showing that @xmath151 in view of inequality and we show that the inner norm in is dominated for every @xmath1 by @xmath152 for some @xmath153 .",
    "an important intermediate step in establishing this bound are the vector - valued estimates in @xcite @xmath154 the idea of using vector - valued inequalities allows us to overcome many technical difficulties and , as far as we know , has not been used in this context before .",
    "we also employ this idea in the continuous setup and provide a new proof of short variations estimates for the operators of radon type in @xcite .",
    "we refer to the appendix for more details .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we collected necessary numerical inequalities which give relation between @xmath2-variational seminorms and various square functions and even more general objects , see especially lemma [ lem:6 ] and lemma [ lem:8 ] and inequality .",
    "all these results are important building blocks in our approach . finally , we propose some lifting lemma ( see lemma [ lem:1 ] ) which allows us to replace any polynomial mapping @xmath34 by the canonical polynomial mapping @xmath155 which has all coefficients equal to 1 .",
    "this guarantees that our further bounds will be independent of coefficients of the underlying polynomial mapping .",
    "in section [ sec:3 ] we recall further results whose proofs were given in @xcite .",
    "theorem [ thm:3 ] is a variant of multidimensional weyl s sum estimates with logarithmic decay .",
    "we also include some basic tools which allow us to efficiently compare discrete @xmath156 norms with continuous @xmath157 norms .",
    "finally , theorem [ th:3 ] is a major step towards proving and .",
    "this theorem originates in ionescu and wainger paper @xcite with @xmath158 loss where @xmath159 is a large power .",
    "this is a deep result which uses the most sophisticated tools developed to date in this area .    in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we state theorem [ thm:5 ] which is the main result of this section .",
    "however , we omit the proof , since it can be deduced from the methods of proof of theorem b from @xcite by simply replacing the supremum norm by the long @xmath2-variational seminorm ; or it can be completed following the scheme of the proof from section [ sec:6 ] , which contains long @xmath2-variational estimates for the operator @xmath160 . we have decided to provide a complete proof of long @xmath2-variational estimates for the operator @xmath160 , since there are some subtle differences which did not occur in @xcite where the maximal function associated with @xmath160 was studied , and this would cause some unnecessary confusions .    in section [ sec:5 ] and section [ sec:7 ] we provide detailed proofs of short variations estimates for operators @xmath161 and @xmath160 respectively .    finally ,",
    "in the appendix , which is self - contained , we give a new proof of strong @xmath2-variational estimates for the operators of radon type in the continuous setting , which are needed above .",
    "there are two novel aspects of our proof .",
    "the first concerns a different approach to lpingle s inequality for martingales and is based on theorem [ thm:20 ] which is a new ingredient here .",
    "the second aspect concerns the estimates of short variations which now are based to a large extent on vector - valued estimates for operators of radon type , which have been recently obtained in @xcite . for the reader s",
    "convenience we provide details and describe this method in the context of dyadic martingales on homogeneous spaces ; however ,",
    "the methods are general enough to be applicable in a boarder context .",
    "finally , let us emphasize the following .",
