    "hadron - hadron interactions play important roles in nuclear and hadron physics . among them",
    "baryon - baryon interaction is one of the most important issues to be clarified in reliable manners : baryons are the main building blocks of our world and their interactions are essential for the structures and dynamics of nuclei . after the successful proposal by yukawa in 1935  @xcite ,",
    "the long- and the intermediate - range interactions have been described by one - boson - exchange potentials ( obep )  @xcite .",
    "the key players for the hadronic interactions in these regions are considered as mesonic modes . on the other hand ,",
    "the short - range part of the interactions has not been well clarified so far .",
    "especially , the origin of the large repulsive core in nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) channel  @xcite , which accounts for the high - density nuclear phenomena , has been one of the longstanding problems in hadron physics  @xcite .",
    "the degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons would be essential in such short - distance region , and hence they should be clarified directly in terms of the fundamental theory , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is now common knowledge that all the hadronic systems are governed by qcd , and it is long after qcd was established as the fundamental theory .",
    "nevertheless , qcd - based description of hadronic systems has not yet been successful due to the strong coupling nature of the low - energy qcd , whose dynamics is far from the perturbative regime and essentially nonperturbative . among potentially workable strategies for nonperturbative analyses of qcd ,",
    "lattice qcd is a unique reliable method for low - energy qcd",
    ". it can now reproduce empirical hadronic masses with a very good accuracy  @xcite , and its outcome can be directly compared with experiments .",
    "there have been several attempts which aim at clarification of interhadron interactions by means of lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "recently , a nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction was evaluated from nn bethe - salpeter ( bs ) amplitudes on the lattice  @xcite , where the short - range repulsion and the attraction in the intermediate region were observed . while the information of scattering phase shifts are properly encoded in asymptotic bs amplitudes , `` potentials '' directly constructed from bs amplitudes have setup- ( operator- or energy- ) dependences .",
    "nevertheless , they are considered useful to gain qualitative understanding of hadronic interactions .    in this article",
    ", we employ su(2 ) lattice qcd , and investigate hadronic interactions aiming at clarifying the essential structure of them .",
    "first , the scalar diquark ( @xmath1 , the lightest baryon in su(2 ) system ) is an isospin - zero scalar hadronic state in su(2 ) qcd and some of possible one - meson - exchange channels in diquark interactions are restricted , and hence analyses could be simpler .",
    "diquarks in su(2 ) qcd have a direct connection to mesons , and two - diquark correlators are identical with two - meson correlators if we neglect possible quark - disconnected diagrams .",
    "second , while su(2 ) and su(3 ) qcds have different natures in some situations  @xcite , they often show similar aspects  @xcite , and hence su(2 ) qcd can be a testbed for understanding hadron interactions . on the lattice , it is possible to switch on / off pauli - blocking effects among quarks controlling flavor contents or equivalently quark - exchange diagrams , which enables us to classify hadronic interactions in terms of their origins .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "this method has been further employed for various hadron - hadron channels  @xcite .",
    "we measure a two - diquark correlator @xmath2 at euclidean - time @xmath3 , which is defined as @xmath4 here , @xmath5 represents the relative coordinate of two scattering hadrons , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are interpolating fields for diquark states whose flavors are @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "we employ wall - type operators for sources , while we use point - type operators for sinks .",
    "after euclidean - time evolution , a system is finally dominated by the ground - state , and @xmath19 loses @xmath3-dependence besides an overall constant and an exponential damping factor .",
    "the bs wavefunction @xmath20 is then obtained as @xmath21 .    with such @xmath20",
    ", we can define an @xmath5-dependent function @xmath22 assuming a nonrelativistic schr \" odinger - type equation , @xmath23 thus extracted scattering - energy dependent function @xmath22 is an equivalent potential which reproduces the scattering phase shift at the target energy .",
    "though the information of phase shift is properly encoded in such equivalent potentials @xmath22 , they could be energy- and operator - dependent . in this sense , equivalent potentials @xmath22 contain no more definite information than phase shifts in asymptotic region .",
    "nevertheless , equivalent potentials are expected to be useful to gain understanding of hadronic interactions , at least qualitatively .",
    "we extract equivalent potentials , which we simply call as `` potential '' in this paper , and evaluate hadronic interactions in su(2 ) qcd .",

    "i.e. _ pauli - blocking effect among quarks , are included , @xmath44 shows repulsion in short - distance region , and this repulsion arises only from the exchange diagrams .",
    "we have defined the `` quark - exchange part '' @xmath56 in the potential , which is induced by adding quark - exchange diagrams , or equivalently , by introducing pauli blocking among some of quarks .",
    "namely , when some of the quarks have identical flavors , @xmath86 , the quark - exchange part @xmath56 is defined as @xmath144 , which means the interhadron potential is written as @xmath145 it indicates that the short - range repulsive core in @xmath44 _ arises only from the `` quark - exchange part '' _ @xmath56 .",
    "pauli blocking among quarks seems essentially needed to generate repulsive force between two hadrons .",

    "one prominent observation is that all the @xmath84-functions @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 are quark - mass independent , which implies that _ the quark - mass dependences of _ @xmath56 and @xmath57 _ do not appear in interaction ranges but only in the overall strengths_. though we first adopted the specific function @xmath151 for potential - form analyses , we finally found that simple rescaling of the potential @xmath152 ( the lattice data themselves ) well explains all the quark - mass dependences .",
    "that is , we eventually encounter no scheme dependence in these descriptions .",
    "these observations apparently do not go together with the meson - exchange picture among hadrons , since @xmath45-dependences of interaction ranges seem very small .",
    "at least in the present quark - mass range , mesonic contributions seem small and subdominant , and hence we observed interactions of the other origins .    for the repulsive part , we have found that the strength grows as @xmath153 , which is similar to but slightly stronger than the color - magnetic interaction itself by one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) processes .",
    "considering that the pauli blocking among quarks is essential for the repulsion and the interaction range of the repulsive force has a very weak quark - mass dependence , it is likely to originate from a color - magnetic interaction among quarks .",
    "actually , the function @xmath140 is energy and operator dependent . in order to clarify operator dependence ,",
    "we have constructed `` projected '' smeared operators and compared the results with and without operator smearing . as a result , we observed quantitative changes in potential shapes . quantitative evaluation of interhadron potentials seems difficult at present , because of its operator dependences . on the other hand ,",
    "several basic properties remain qualitatively unchanged with / without operator smearing : ( 1 ) _ the existence of universal attraction between two hadrons . _",
    "( 2 ) _ the difference @xmath87 still shows repulsive contribution at any @xmath31 s . _",
    "( 3 ) _ the quark - mass dependences of the interaction ranges of direct and exchange parts of potentials ( @xmath39,@xmath53 ) are much weaker than expected from meson exchanges .",
    "_ ( 4 ) _ the quark - mass dependence of the strength of @xmath53 is consistent with or stronger than @xmath138 . _ to determine the precise forms of interhadron potentials , it would be necessary to perform more sophisticated analyses taking into account energy dependence in a less operator - dependent way .",
    "since quark - mass dependence in interaction ranges does not appear , the origin of the interactions we observed so far would be all gluonic interactions and/or flavor - exchange processes , _ e.g. _ color - magnetic or color - coulomb interactions , and so on , rather than mesonic contributions .",
    "as was found in our analyses , attractive forces are readily masked by the strong repulsive force appearing in the @xmath52 potential in the light quark - mass region .",
    "if the universal attraction in hadronic interaction appears also in su(3 ) qcd , they might be observed in a channel with no or less quark - exchange contribution between hadrons , such as @xmath154 scattering state . in the lighter quark - mass region ,",
