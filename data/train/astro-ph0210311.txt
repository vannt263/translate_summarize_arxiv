    "weak gravitational lensing by foreground large - scale matter density fluctuations could introduce significant density variations in flux - limited samples of high redshift objects , such as qsos .",
    "this is sometimes called magnification bias or cosmic magnification . in principle",
    ", it is possible to separate the intrinsic density fluctuations in qso samples from the weak lensing magnification signal by cross - correlating the qsos with a low redshift galaxy sample .",
    "this allows a direct measurement of how the galaxy distribution traces the underlaying mass distribution .",
    "much work have been done in this direction both on theory and observations ( for recent reviews see norman & williams 2000 , bartelmann & schneider 2001 , benitez 2001 , guimares , van de bruck and brandenberger 2001 ) .",
    "correlation of low redshift galaxies and high - redshift agns or qsos typically find significant excesses of foreground objects around the qso positions ( seldner & peebles 1979 , tyson 1986 ; fugmann 1988,1990 ; hammer & le fvre 1990 ; hintzen 1991 ; drinkwater 1992 ; thomas 1995 ; bartelmann & schneider 1993 , 1994 ; bartsch , schneider , & bartelmann 1997 ; seitz & schneider ; bentez 1995 ; bentez & martnez - gonzlez 1995 , 1997 ; bentez , martnez - gonzlez & martn - mirones 1997;norman & impey 1999;norman & williams 2000 ) .",
    "see also burbidge 1990 ( and references therein ) for individual associations and different statistical indications . on the other hand ,",
    "there has also been reports of significant anti - correlation between galaxy groups and faint qsos ( see croom & shanks 1999 and references therein ) which could also be explained by weak lensing magnification because of the flater slope of the faint qso number counts . even though the shape of the galaxy - qso cross - correlation has not yet been well constrained , these results seem qualitatively in agreement with the magnification bias effect , but the amplitude of the correlation is found to be higher than that expected from gravitational lensing models based on @xmath10cdm .    what is the origin of this discrepancy ?",
    "part of the problem could be due to the lack of well - defined and homogeneous samples .",
    "after all we are looking for a small effect , may be as low as @xmath23 , and any systematics in the sample definition is likely to introduce cross - correlations at this level ( see  2 below ) .",
    "on the other hand we know little about clustering of dark matter on sub - megaparsec scales .",
    "could the discrepancy be due to real deviations from the @xmath10cdm paradigm ?",
    "recently , mnard & bartelmann ( 2002 ) and mnard , bartelmann & mellier ( 2002 ) have explored the interest of the sdss to cross - correlate foreground galaxies with background qso .",
    "the sdss collaboration made an early data release ( edr ) publicly available on june 2001 .",
    "the edr includes around a million galaxies and 4000 qsos distributed within a narrow strip of 2.5 degrees across the equator ( see stoughton et al 2002 for details ) .",
    "as the strip crosses the galactic plane , the data is divided into two separate sets in the north and south galactic caps .",
    "the sdss collaboration has presented a series of analysis ( zehavi 2002 , blanton 2002 , scranton et a.l 2002 , connolly 2002 , dodelson 2002 , tegmark 2002 , szalay 2002 , szapudi 2002 ) of large scale angular clustering on the north galactic strip , which contains data with the best seeing conditions in the edr .",
    "gaztaaga ( 2002a , 2002b ) presented a first study of bright ( @xmath24 ) sdss galaxies in both the south and north galactic edr strip , centering the analysis on the comparison of clustering to the apm galaxy survey ( maddox 1990 ) .",
    "in this paper we will follow closely mnard , bartelmann & mellier ( 2002 , mbm02 from now on ) proposal to study the galaxy - qso cross - correlation signal in the edr / sdss .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ",
    "2 we present the samples used and the galaxy and qso selection .",
    "section  3 is dedicated to the extinction contamination .",
    "section  4 and  5 presents the main results and its interpretation , while  6 and  7 are dedicated to a discussion and a listing of conclusions .",
    "the galaxy samples are obtained from the edr and converted into pixel maps of different resolutions as described in gaztaaga ( 2002a,2002b ) .",
    "we select objects from an equatorial sgc ( south galactic cap ) strip 2.5 wide ( @xmath25 degrees . ) and 66 deg . long ( @xmath26 deg . ) , which will be called edr / s , and also from a similar ngc ( north galactic cap ) 2.5 wide and 91 deg . long ( @xmath27 deg . ) , which will be called edr / n .",
    "these strips ( sdss numbers 82n/82s and 10n/10s ) correspond to some of the first runs of the early commissioning data ( runs 94/125 and 752/756 ) and have variable seeing conditions .",
    "runs 752 and 125 are the worst with regions where the seeing fluctuates above 2  .",
    "runs 756 and 94 are better , but still have seeing fluctuations of a few tenths of arc - second within scales of a few degrees .",
    "these seeing conditions could introduce large scale gradients because of the corresponding variations in the photometric reduction ( eg star - galaxy separation ) that could manifest as large scale number density gradients ( see scranton et al 2001 for a detail account of these effects ) .",
    "we will test our results against the possible effects of seeing variations , by using a seeing mask ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "redshift targets in the sdss are selected in @xmath28 for galaxies and @xmath29 for qso .",
    "here we use @xmath29 for qso and both @xmath29 and @xmath28 for galaxies . for raw , uncorrected magnitudes , and @xmath30 for extinction corrected magnitudes .",
    "for example , according to schlegel ( 1998 ) @xmath31 corresponds roughly to an average extinction corrected @xmath32 for a mean differential extinction @xmath33 . ]",
    "the first choice has the interest that both galaxies and qso come from the same photometric reduction and are therefore subject to similar systematics .",
    "galactic extinction is also smaller in this band .",
    "the second choice provides a comparison with previous results on galaxy clustering . to maximize the number of galaxies , and therefore the possibility of lensing , we choose broad magnitude bands .",
    "we will focus our results in comparing a nearby sample @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) with a distant one @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "galaxies selected with @xmath38 are almost the same ( within few percent ) to galaxies in @xmath39 as the k - correction cancels out with the color evolution ( see fukugita 1996 ) . here",
    "we take the @xmath38 band as our nominal choice to minimize extinction ( this will give larger area coverage , see below ) .",
    "as we will show , both galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - qso cross - correlations turn out to be almost identical in @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the only difference being slightly smaller errors in the @xmath38 sample . for the bright sample",
    "we stick to @xmath40 to provide a more direct comparison with previous results on galaxy - galaxy clustering . using the redshift distributions in dodelson ( 2002 ) ,",
    "the mean redshift for @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 galaxies ) is @xmath35 , while @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 galaxies within our mask ) have @xmath37 .",
    "we will center our analysis over these two samples , which will be sometimes refered to as @xmath40 and @xmath38 .",
    "the 1st and 3rd slices in figure [ pixelmap ] shows the edr / s and edr / n pixel maps for @xmath45 and @xmath46 arc - minute resolution .",
    "note the `` barrel '' shape in the edr / n .",
    "as far as we have been able to find out , this seems an unreported artifact in the edr redshift sample release which does not seem to include redshifts for secondary targets in this equatorial strip ( see stoughton et al 2002 for details ) .",
    "this is not a problem in our analysis other than we are missing a good fraction of the edr / n because there are no matching redshifts for the qsos .",
    "the top slice in figure [ pixelmap2 ] shows a zoom over the central region of edr / n .",
    "we recovered the qso sample form the sdss / edr as described in detailed in schneider et al ( 2002 , see also richards 2002 ) .",
    "we use point - spread function magnitudes for qso ( which will be quoted with a subindex : @xmath47 ) and petrosian magnitudes for galaxies ( which will be quoted without any subindex : ie @xmath29 ) , as indicated by above references .",
    "we have considered two qso samples .",
    "the one obtained directly from the edr data archive ( ie just with @xmath48 ) containing 4275 qsos , which we call edr / qso , and the corrected public qso sample presented in schneider et al ( 2002 ) , which we called sdss / qso and contains 3814 qsos .",
    "almost all sdss / qso is contained in edr / qso .",
    "sdss / qso contains a handful of additional balqsos and some quasars that were identified by eye during the checking process .",
    "sdss / qso excludes most of the low - redshift agn ( @xmath49 ) and a small number of narrow - line qso included edr / qso , but this makes little different for our sample which has @xmath50 .    out of the edr / qso sample",
    "we impose two further cuts : @xmath51 to exclude failed or inconsistent redshifts and @xmath52 to exclude redshifts with confidence less than @xmath53 ( see stoughton 2002 for details ) . in both samples",
    "we restrict our analysis to @xmath54 where the qso distribution is compact and homogeneous ( the lower cut avoids overlap with the galaxy sample ) . after these cuts the main difference between edr / qso and sdss / qso are the few missing radio qso and a few narrow - band emission qso s . over @xmath55 of the qsos",
    "are the same and have the same parameters .",
    "note that according to schneider 2002 , qso selection criteria were changed systematically during the edr runs resulting in large variation on the number of qsos per field .",
    "nevertheless both samples are photometrically completed to better than @xmath56 in @xmath57 are raw magnitudes .",
    "the extinction corrected limit is @xmath58 . ]",
    "( schneider 2002 , stoughton 2002 ) .",
    "we will therefore restrict our analysis to @xmath57 and further compare results for the two versions of the target selection that are relevant to our sky coverage : v2.2a and v2.7 ( see stoughton 2002 ) .",
    "number counts and the redshift distribution are shown in fig.[edrqsoccounts ] .",
    "note the sharp break in the qso number counts at @xmath59 .",
    "the short - dashed line shows a power law with @xmath60 ( which corresponds to @xmath61 in eq.[[deltamu1 ] ] ) . as lensing magnification",
    "should be negative for shallower slopes , we cut the qso sample to @xmath62 ( which contains @xmath63 qsos for @xmath64 within our mask ) and use the fainter cut @xmath65 data ( which contains @xmath66 qsos within our mask ) for comparison . thus , unless stated otherwise , qso are selected with @xmath67 , which for brevity will be sometimes refered as @xmath62 .",
    "right panel in fig.[edrqsoccounts ] shows how the redshift distribution for @xmath62 of edr / qso ( histogram ) and sdss / qso ( dashed line ) are almost identical , with a mean redshift of @xmath68 .",
    "the redshift distribution for @xmath69 is very similar ( with just higher surface density ) . here",
    "we will only present results based on edr / qso .",
    "we have done all the analysis for sdss / qso and find identical results in all cases .",
    "we choose to present edr / qso because it has been automatically produced ( in the same pipeline as the galaxies ) and because we are not concerned with the astrophysical nature of the qso in the sample but rather with having a well defined photometric sample of distant objects .",
    "figure [ pixelmap ] compares the galaxy pixel maps @xmath45 with the qso @xmath70 distribution in the same portion of the sky ( qsos are the 2nd and 4th slices below the corresponding edr / n and edr / s galaxies ) .",
    "figure [ pixelmap2 ] shows a zoom over the central region of edr / n .",
    "note that there is no apparent correlation between qso and galaxies .",

    "absorption by galactic dust can lead to a positive correlation between galaxies and high - z qsos ( see norman & williams 1999 ) .",
    "schlegel ( 1998 ) extinction maps have a significant differential extinction @xmath71 even at the poles .",
    "thus , the extinction correction has a large impact in the number counts for a fix magnitude range .",
    "the change can be roughly accounted for by shifting the mean magnitude ranges by the mean extinction . despite this",
    ", extinction has little impact on clustering , at least for @xmath72 ( see scranton 2001 and also tegmark et al .",
    "this is fortunate because of the uncertainties involved in making the extinction maps and its calibration .",
    "moreover , the schlegel ( 1998 ) extinction map only has a 6.1 fwhm , which is much larger than the individual galaxies and qso we are interested on .",
    "many dusty regions have filamentary structure ( with a fractal pattern ) and large fluctuations in extinction from point to point ( ie see fig.[mapext ] ) .",
    "one would expect similar fluctuations on smaller ( galaxy size ) scales , which introduces further uncertainties to individual corrections .",
    "as we are looking for a very low signal ( of order of @xmath23 ) we have to be very careful with small systematic effects , such as extinction .",
    "the net effect of extinction is to produce a magnitude absorption @xmath73 which translates into a change in the local galaxy surface number density @xmath74 : _ a a where @xmath75 is the slope of the number density counts : @xmath76 as a function of magnitude @xmath77 .",
    "if the absorption @xmath73 were a constant , this will would only change the mean number density in an uniform way .",
    "unfortunately extinction is highly variable and produces density fluctuations in the sky : _ a _ a - < _ a > = ( a- < _ a > ) we thus see that extinction will introduce spurious number density fluctuations in both the galaxy and the qso distributions : _ g & = & _ g + s_g  _ a + _ q & = & _ q + s_q  _ a where @xmath78 and @xmath79 stand for the total observed fluctuations ( as opposed to the intrinsic ones , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constant numbers characteristic of each population . from the above analysis we can see that extinction will introduce artificial cross - correlations between the galaxy and qso populations , even when they are intrinsically uncorrelated .",
    "one can correct for this type of effects by using the absorption maps .",
    "we can calculate the cross - correlations : & = & s_g  < ^2_a > + < _ q  _ a > & = & s_q  < ^2_a > + < _ g  _ q > & = & < _ g  _ q > + s_g  s_q  < ^2_a > where we have assumed that the intrinsic galaxy and qso positions are uncorrelated with extinction .",
    "we thus have : = < _ g  _ q > + < _ g  _ a > < _ a  _ q > [ wgqext ] where @xmath84 is the intrinsic cross - correlation ( eg from cosmic magnification ) .",
    "as we can measure all @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 from the maps , the above expression allow us to correct the galaxy - qso cross - correlation for extinction .",
    "to test this model we will consider 3 types of magnitude corections : _ raw magnitudes _",
    "( ie uncorrected from extinction ) : @xmath29 ; extinction @xmath73 corrected magnitudes : @xmath88 ; and extinction over - corrected magnitudes : @xmath89 .",
    "the later case will give us a good diagnostic to test our method to estimate the contamination in the galaxy - qso cross - correlation .",
    "the results for these quantities are shown in the left panel of fig.[w2z ] .",
    "note how @xmath87 ( shown as closed squares ) is quite flat .",
    "this is because of the lack of resolution on scales @xmath90 .",
    "on larger scales , schlegel ( 1998 ) find that the angular spectrum of their absorption maps fit well @xmath91 at all scale which corresponds to @xmath92 , so that fluctuations grow only slowly with scale .",
    "fig.[w2z ] shows the prediction in eq.[[wgqext ] ] as a continuous line , which is close to @xmath93 for the top case ( in all cases we are using @xmath94 pixel maps for both qso and galaxies ) . as can be seen in the figure , when we over - correct the magnitudes for extinction ( top panel ) the correction is larger than when we use raw ( uncorrected ) magnitudes ( shown in the middle panel ) , as expected .",
    "this illustrates how extinction could induce cross - correlations in the qso and galaxy maps .",
    "when we apply the right ( negative ) extinction correction to the magnitudes ( bottom left panel ) we find a negligible correlation within the error - bars .",
    "this result agrees well with that of using the raw magnitudes with and extinction mask ( ie masking out the high extinction pixels , see below ) .",
    "either of this two last options is acceptable for our analysis as the residual cross - correlation is negligible given the error - bars .    in the right panel of fig.[w2z ]",
    "we show the galaxy - qso cross - correlation @xmath0 for maps with extinction over - corrected magnitudes @xmath95 ( closed squares ) with @xmath0 for maps with raw @xmath96 ( open squares ) .",
    "the dashed line shows again @xmath0 with extinction over - corrected magnitudes after subtracting the correction in eq.[[wgqext ] ] ( ie continuous line in the top left panel of fig.[w2z ] ) .",
    "the agreement is quite good indicating that there is only marginal contamination of extinction in @xmath0 when we use raw magnitudes ( in agreement with the middle left panel of fig.[w2z ] ) .",
    "these results gives us some confident that we can control this type of contamination in @xmath0 ( and also provides a further test to our cross - correlation codes ) .",
    "= 8truecm      following scranton et al ( 2002 ) , pixels ( in 6 resolution ) with larger mean seeing or larger mean extinction than some threshold value are masked out from our analysis .",
    "the final mask is the product of this seeing and extinction mask ( ie shown in fig.[mapext ] ) by the sample boundary ( shown in fig.[pixelmap2 ] ) .",
    "we have tried different thresholds following the analysis of scranton et al ( 2001 ) . as a compromise between precision and area covered , unless stated otherwise , we use 0.2 maximum extinction and seeing better than 1.8 for @xmath97 and @xmath38 . for @xmath40 we relax the seeing cut to 2 arc - sec to include more galaxies .",
    "for these brighter galaxies 2 arc - sec provides very good photometry for clustering analysis ( see scranton 2001 ) .    bottom left panel in fig.[w2z ]",
    "shows the cross - correlation results after applying the extinction mask over raw @xmath96 magnitudes .",
    "the resulting contamination in @xmath0 is negligible .",
    "for our statistical analysis , we will use moments of counts in cells , eg the variance : w_gg ( ) = < ^2_g ( ) > where @xmath98 are number density fluctuations on cells of size @xmath99 ( larger than the pixel map resolution ) and @xmath100 is the mean number of galaxies in the cell .",
    "the average @xmath101 is over angular positions in the sky .",
    "we follow closely gaztaaga ( 1994 , see also szapudi 1995 ) and use the same software and estimators here for the sdss .",
    "this software have been tested in different ways and the results confirmed by independent studies ( eg see szapudi & gaztaaga 1998 ) .    for the cross - correlation we use (",
    "see also mbm02 ) : w_gq ( ) = < _ g ( ) _ q ( ) > note that this is different from the 2-point cross - correlation : @xmath102 , where @xmath103 . in our case , both cells are at the same location in the sky , and the scale dependence comes from changing the cell size .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 is just an area average over @xmath104 , and its amplitude at scale @xmath99 is typically @xmath105 higher that @xmath104 at @xmath106 ( see fig.1 in gaztaaga 1994 ) . also note that shot - noise cancels out for cross - correlation @xmath0 , but not for @xmath11 and @xmath107 where the variance needs to be shot - noise corrected ( eg gaztaaga 1994 ) .",
    "the reason for using the variance @xmath0 rather than the 2-point @xmath108 function is twofold .",
    "firstly one expects the variance to provide better signal - to - noise ratios when the correlation signal is small , just because @xmath0 is an integrated quantity .",
    "secondly , mnard ( 2002 ) have argued that @xmath0 provides a better estimator to improve the accuracy of the comparison with the theoretical predictions in the weak lensing regime .",
    "we have in fact performed a calculation of the @xmath108 cross - correlation over the same data , using the simple counts - in - cell estimator for @xmath108 ( eg eq.[36 ] in gaztaaga 1994 ) .",
    "the results were dominated by noise ( sampling errors ) and we have therefore decided to just concentrate our efforts on @xmath0 .",
    "we will also measure the galaxy - galaxy - qso 3rd order moment : w_ggq ( ) = < _ g ( ) _ g ( ) _ q ( ) >    and the galaxy - galaxy variance around qsos : w_gg;q ( ) = < _ g ( ) _ g ( ) > _ qso the extra or excess variance is defined as ( mbm02 ) : ( ) w_gg;q ( ) - w_gg ( ) which turns out to be a measure of the 3-point function @xmath109 ( fry & peebles 1980 , mbm02 ) .",
    "errors are obtained from a variation of the jackknife error scheme proposed by scranton et al ( 2001 , eq.[10 ] ) .",
    "the sample is divided into @xmath74 separate regions on the sky , each of equal area ( in our case they are cuts in ra such that the number of pixel cells is equal in each region ) .",
    "the analysis is performed @xmath74 times , each leaving a different region out .",
    "these are called ( jackknife ) subsamples , which we label @xmath110 .",

    "the large - scale clustering of the mass in the linear ( and weakly non - linear ) regime is given by that of the correlation between halos , which should trace the linear ( and weakly non - linear ) perturbation theory predictions , while the small - scale clustering of the mass arises from a convolution of the halo density profile with itself .",
    "thus , in this model the results from weak - lensing magnification in right panel of fig.[x2c80sdss ] mostly traces the halo profiles .",
    "smith ( 2002 ) present new versions of the universal non - linear fitting formulae @xmath260 that incorporate these new ideas .",
    "the new formulae seems to perform quite well against the virgo n - body simulations . for the @xmath10cdm model , the comparison involves scales up to @xmath267 h / mpc , which corresponds to @xmath268 mpc / h , comparable to the ones of interest here .",
    "we will therefore use this new formulae for @xmath260 ( as implemented in the software made publicly available in smith 2002 ) , to compare to our results . as a first test ,",
    "left panel of fig.[x2c80sdss ] shows the smith ( 2002 ) non - linear prediction ( dashed - line ) against our n - body results from @xmath10cdm simulation ( opened circles ) .",
    "the agreement is excellent and does not involve any additional parameter fitting .",
    "it should be noted that the differences with previous fitting formulaes ( eg peacok & dodds 1996 ) in this particular case are small .",
    "this is important as it means that @xmath10cdm predictions for galaxy - qso cross - correlations on non - linear scales in the literature are correct and we need to look elsewhere for the origin of the discrepancy .",
    "as can be seen in the right panel of fig.[x2c80sdss ] the weak - lensing magnification predictions show a very steep non - linear variance , @xmath269 , which in the context of stable model or direct simulation ( see  [ sec : stable ] above ) can be interpreted as indication of a steep linear spectrum @xmath270 .",
    "this steep linear spectrum can be obtained from the smith ( 2002 ) formulae by using a large effective value of the shape parameter @xmath271 .",
    "for example , @xmath272 ( @xmath273 , @xmath235 and @xmath274 ) produces illustrates how different is the measured slope from the expectations in the standard cdm picture .",
    "] @xmath275 .",
    "this prediction is shown as a dotted - line in left panel of fig.[x2c80sdss ] .",
    "this illustrates the point that we need a large positive slope to fit the data .",
    "note that , once we fix the slope ( from the same measurements ) the only free parameter is @xmath276 , which we take to be @xmath273 for consistency with power spectrum measurements ( eg gaztaaga & baugh 1998 , tegmark & zaldarriaga 2002 and references therein ) and with the higher order correlations ( see bernardeau 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "this means that the shape and amplitude for @xmath223 that we find from weak - lensing are compatible with the general picture of non - linear evolution of clustering and with the @xmath273 normalization . under this assumptions",
    "the only difference with the _",
    "standard @xmath10cdm picture _ is that the linear spectrum on small ( non - linear ) scales has to be steeper .",
    "if we match this with the _",
    "standard @xmath10cdm _",
    "@xmath277 on larger scales , this requires @xmath277 to turn around and increase ( rather than decrease ) on galactic scales .",
    "as these scales are not strongly constraint by other observations ( see below ) , the contradiction can be resolved in this way .",
    "other alternatives to the above considerations on non - linear modeling are to change the value of @xmath172 and @xmath278 but keeping @xmath279 ( eg with a low shape parameter ) .",
    "open models with @xmath280 have more power on small scales , just as we need to explain the data",
    ". this does not seem to work for two reasons .",
    "first , because if we lower @xmath281 the weak lensing magnification signal becomes smaller which translates into a higher value of the recovered mass @xmath223 .",
    "second , because the non - linear slope @xmath144 is too low compare to the weak - lensing reconstruction .",
    "as mentioned above ( end of  6.4 ) closed models with @xmath239 predict a three times stronger weak lensing magnification signal .",
    "this translates into a nine times smaller reconstructed variance and three times larger biasing , which is still not able to reconcile the discrepancy with the standard predictions for the amplitude of non - linear matter fluctuations .",
    "bernardeau et al ( 1997 ) predicted @xmath282 for the convergence skewness @xmath283 in the @xmath10cdm model .",
    "one should roughly expect @xmath284 , so that a direct comparison with eq.[[s3 ] ] using our mean @xmath68 yields @xmath285 .",
    "this is high and about 3 sigma out of the currently favored value of @xmath286 ( eg tegmark & zaldarriaga 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "note nevertheless that this is just a very rough comparison , both because we need to take into account non - linear effects ( see hui 1999 ) and because of the differences with pseudo - skewness .",
    "a direct comparison can be made to fig.3 in mnard , bartelmann & mellier ( 2002 ) , which corresponds to @xmath287 .",
    "again here , the values for @xmath136 in eq.[[s3 ] ] favor the @xmath239 and seem about 3-sigma away from the @xmath288 value .",
    "the @xmath283 predictions are insensitive to the linear ( scale dependence ) bias and the amplitude and shape of the linear mass spectrum .",
    "but note that they are quite sensitive to linear spectrum @xmath289 of fluctuations on non - linear scales as they relay on the so - called saturation value in hyper - extended perturbation theory ( scoccimarro & frieman 1999 ) .",
    "if we change the value from @xmath279 to @xmath290 , as suggested by the non - linear slope @xmath144 ( see  [ sec : stable ] above ) then we get a value for @xmath283 which is about @xmath291 times smaller .",
    "we thus have @xmath292 which now yields : _ m 0.15  ^-0.05_+0.08 [ omegam ] in better agreement with the @xmath10cdm cosmology .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , previous measurements of galaxy - qso associations typically find evidence for weak lensing magnification .",
    "in fact , our results seem to agree well with the ones presented in benitez ( 2001 and references therein ) which also seem at odds with current expectation ( see bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) .    are these results in contradiction with other measurements of the mass or of the bias ? on these scales we have measurements of the spectrum from ly - alpha forest ( croft 2002 ) , but they are mostly sensitive to the linear regime , as they correspond to higher redshifts . weak shear lensing results ( hoekstra 2002 ) seem to agree well with the _ standard @xmath10cdm picture _ above , and therefore seems at odds with the results presented here . in particular , compare @xmath293 in fig.6 in hoekstra 2002 with our @xmath294 in fig.[w2bover ] , which are both obtained under the same definitions of biasing parameters .",
    "note nevertheless that our analysis is probing slightly smaller scales , and more importantly note that we do not assume any specific model for the underlaying matter fluctuations .",
    "if the value of @xmath295 is indeed as large as indicated by our analysis one would also expect a stronger aperture mass variance , but given the number of parameters involved in the comparison of data with theory , some other interpretations may still be possible ( eg croft & metzler 2000 , mackey , white & kamionkowski 2002 ) .",
    "more work is needed to understand this apparent discrepancy .",
    "the values of @xmath283 found by bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier ( 2002 ) from the virmos - descart data should also be compared with the pseudo - skewness we find in fig.[s3edr ] .",
    "our results for a strong galaxy - qso cross - correlation passed several test presented in  3 and  4 and fig.[w2mz]-[w2icut ] .",
    "in particular note right panel in figure [ w2icut ] which shows how the signal disappears for faint qsos , as expected if produced by weak lensing magnification . also note in top - left panel of fig.[w2icut ] that the brighter the qso sample the larger the amplitude of the positive detection .",
    "strong galaxy - qso or cluster - qso lensing magnification can also contribute to the positive cross - correlation .",
    "multiple qsos images or just strong magnification by chance alignment will typically give positive correlations , in addition to the magnification bias effect .",
    "the key issue here is the probability of strong lensing , which for a fixed qso redshift increases with the number density of qsos .",
    "thus , one would expect this effect to be stronger for the fainter qsos , as the mean density is larger and the redshift distribution is very similar .",
    "this is contrary to what we find in fig.[w2icut ] .",
    "moreover , benitez 2001 argue that for strong lensing @xmath296 , where @xmath297 is the fraction of qsos in a sample that are strongly lensed . in fig .",
    "[ w2gqfit ] we find @xmath298 on the smallest scale for @xmath299 .",
    "this requires @xmath300 , which is unrealistic given the small size of the eisntein radius of galaxies or clusters .",
    "non - linear corrections to the weak - lensing approximation are typically small for the variance ( see mnard 2002 ) .",
    "thus , weak lensing magnification seems the most plausible explanation for the detected galaxy - qso correlation ( for other interpretations see burbidge 1990 ) .",
    "[ w2gqfit ] and fig.[x2c80sdss ] summarized the main results presented in this paper , which seems at odds with the standard @xmath10cdm model , both because the large amplitude and the steep slope of the recovered variance on non - linear scales .",
    "note that this broad interpretation is independent of the details in our modeling to recover the variance . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ w2gqfit ] we find @xmath298 on the smallest scale for @xmath299 .",
    "this alone , indicates that the bias factor @xmath230 has to be quite small , @xmath301 , as weak lensing is typically less efficient that unity . in  6 we argue that a possible explanation for this strong correlation is that the effective linear spectral slope , @xmath302 , on small scales is @xmath303 , which reproduces the measured slope @xmath259 in agreement with eq.[[stable ] ] . this is much steeper than in @xmath10cdm , where @xmath279 and @xmath254",
    ". within currently accepted cosmological parameters ( @xmath18 , @xmath288 and @xmath304 ) adopting @xmath303 can explain at the same time the slope and amplitude of the recovered variance in fig.[x2c80sdss ] and the low skewness in fig.[s3edr ] .",
    "in the @xmath10cdm cosmology this corresponds to a bump or step on the power spectrum @xmath277 on galatic scales .",
    "a physical interpretation for this feature can be found in the early universe , where a bump or step in the primordial sprectum is expected ( see barriga 2001 ) .",
    "if such a primordial feature is really present , it would have important implications for models of galaxy formation .",
    "our weak lensing analysis requieres the bias @xmath230 to be a strong function of scale decreasing from @xmath305 at large scales to @xmath306 at galactic scales , thus hiding the presence of such primordial bump .",
    "note nevertheless , that if biasing is more complicated than modeled here ( eg eq.[bgamma_b ] ) , our quantitative interpretation could be different in detail ( see the appendix for a discussion ) .",
    "this is a preliminary analysis from a small fraction of the sdss early commissioning data . to explain the detected excess galaxy - qso correlation of @xmath307 with correlated photometric errors , such us flat - fielding or scatter light",
    ", we would need very significant photometric variations : rms of at least @xmath308 on arc - minute scales , realistic slopes require even larger photometric errors .",
    "] , which is larger than the nominal calibration uncertainties of 0.03 magnitudes ( see stoughton et al 2002 ) .",
    "it is improbable that such large photometric errors are present in the edr / sdss as they would have already been detected as an excess galaxy - galaxy correlation when compared to other surveys ( eg see gaztaaga 2002a , 2002b , connolly 2002 , scranton 2002 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the full sdss catalog should be able to do a much better analysis of systematics that the one presented here and confirm or refute our findings with a high significance .",
    "a larger piece of the sdss would allow a comparisons to larger scales , which is missing in our analysis because of the narrow width of the edr strips .",
    "on larger scales , the weak - lensing magnification signal can be more directly compared to other indications of mass clustering , which will be an essential test for cosmology and for the weak lensing magnification nature of these cross - correlations .",

    "we will consider two different mathematical approaches to parameterize the effects of biasing , ie .",
    "how galaxy fluctuations @xmath80 trace the underlaying mass distribution @xmath160 .",
    "more elaborated physical models are based on semi - analytical galaxy formation ( see eg baugh , cole & frenk 1996 , seljak 2000 , scoccimarro 2001 , sheth 2001 , cooray & sheth 2002 ) but the results are quite model dependent .",
    "the first model consists in assuming that bias is linear , but non - local : _",
    "g(x ) =  d^3 x  b(x - x )  ( x ) which in fourier space is just : _",
    "g(k ) = b(k )   ( k ) [ bk ] this translates into a scale - dependence bias on the power - spectrum : p_g(k ) = b^2(k )  p(k ) for a power - law correlation @xmath277 and a power - law @xmath309 we have that the galaxy variance is _ g ( r ) = b^2_0.2  _ 0.2 ^ 2 ( 0.2 mpc / h ) ^+2_b [ bgamma_b ] where @xmath148 and @xmath191 characterize the amplitude and scale dependence of the effective bias : b(r)= b_0.2 ( 0.2 ) ^_b .",
    "if @xmath195 this reduces to the standard linear biasing model @xmath310 .    in the second model we assume that bias is non - linear , but local : _",
    "g(r ) = f[(r ) ] . for small fluctuations @xmath311 : _ g",
    "b_1   + b_2   ^2 + b_3   ^3 + which gives rise to ( see fry & gaztaaga 1993 ) : _ g = b_1 ^ 2  + c  ^2 + d  ^3 +  [ biasc ] where @xmath312 depends both on the non - linear biasing parameters and @xmath283 , the reduced skewness of the mass .",
    "thus , the local model formally gives _",
    "g = f [ ] which reduces to the standard linear biasing model @xmath313 for @xmath314 . on non - linear scales we can write : _",
    "g k ^  , which reproduces eq.[[bgamma_b ] ] with @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",
    "thus we have shown that two quite different hypothesis about biasing drives to a similar expression , ie eq.[[bgamma_b ] ] , at least in the power - law limit .",
    "it is therefore plausible to assume that a more generic non - local and non - linear biasing could also be cast with such a parameterization .",
    "we therefore adopt eq.[[bgamma_b ] ] on the assumption that a power - law should be a good approximation for the limited range of scales we consider here",
    ". we will be able to somehow test this assumption with the data .",
    "the stochasticity of the galaxy - mass relation can also contribute to the observed galaxy clustering ( see pen 1998 , scherrer & weinberg 1998 , tegmark & peebles 1998 , dekel & lahav 1999 , matsubara 1999 , bernardeau 2002 , and references therein ) , so that the relation between @xmath80 and @xmath160 is not deterministic but rather stochastic , @xmath317 + \\epsilon_\\delta(r ) \\label{eulocbias2}\\ ] ] where the random field @xmath318 denotes the scatter in the biasing relation at a given @xmath160 due to the fact that @xmath319 does not completely determine @xmath320 . under the assumption that the scatter is local , in the sense that the correlation functions of @xmath321 vanish sufficiently fast at large separations ( i.e. faster than the correlations in the density field )",
    ", the deterministic bias results hold for the two - point correlation function in the large - scale limit ( scherrer & weinberg 1998 ) .      note that @xmath322 and @xmath230 are mean quantities and both contain information on the scale independence and the stochastic @xmath250 .",
    "this provides a different parameterization of biasing than the one given in the above subsection and has been used by hoekstra ( 2002 ) to characterize the comparison of the weak - lensing and galaxy correlations . to provide a comparison we also present in fig.[w2bover ] results for @xmath194 define in such a way , but note that the meaning of @xmath230 here is quite different from the one in eq.[[bk ]",
    "] ( see dekel & lahav 1999 ) .",
    "note that the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath323 , which introduces important constraints : eg @xmath324 implies @xmath325 .",
    "the parameterization presented in the above subsection in terms of @xmath148 and @xmath191 , is not necessarily in contradiction with the idea that the stochasticity could play an important role in biasing .",
    "we choose @xmath148 and @xmath191 for simplicity and to keep the number of parameters to a minimum . at each scale we can recover from our analysis the above stochastic modeling by simply replacing our constraints for @xmath148 by constraints @xmath194 and our constraints for @xmath189 by constraints on @xmath326 . as @xmath327",
    "we have that @xmath328 which shows that our prediction for @xmath189 , assuming @xmath329 , is a lower bound .",
    "thus the qualitative conclusion in  7 , that @xmath189 is too large as compare to @xmath10cdm models , is unchange by this modeling of bias .",
