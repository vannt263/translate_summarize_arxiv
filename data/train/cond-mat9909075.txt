    "electron transport in quantum wires is of significant interest because of the fundamental role that electron - electron interaction plays there . it is known that an arbitrarily small interaction destroys the quasi - particle excitations in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) normal fermi - system .",
    "@xcite the excitations of an interacting 1d system are of bosonic nature .",
    "they represent the waves of electron density , transferring charge and producing current .",
    "these waves have two components : one is smooth on the scale of the fermi wavelength , and the other rapidly oscillates in space .",
    "the contribution of the smooth density component to transport is now well investigated .",
    "@xcite however , the theoretical predictions pertaining to this part of the density are not unambiguously supported by experiment to date .",
    "moreover , there is a principal question of what effects , connected inherently with electron - electron interaction , are observable in transport . turning to this question , we draw attention to the fact that the luttinger liquid is a strongly correlated electron state . therefore ,",
    "exploring interaction effects inevitably must involve the rapidly oscillating density component , which describes short - range electron correlations .",
    "this component of electron density comes from the interference of electrons , moving in opposite directions .",
    "it resembles the charge density waves ( cdw ) in peierls systems , but , in contrast to them , it is not accompanied by a lattice deformation .",
    "@xcite the characteristic wave number of the cdw component is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a fermi wave number .    this density component is usually taken into account when the system contains an impurity",
    ".  @xcite the latter pins cdw , resulting in the electron density oscillations around the impurity , and in the dc conductivity suppression .",
    "it is obvious , that since short - range electron correlations contribute to the density , they must also contribute to transport even if any impurities are absent . in the present paper",
    "we investigate this contribution .",
    "the first problem we meet here is that a conventional bosonized density operator , describing cdw , does not conserve the number of particles in the system , and , consequently , fails to describe correctly 1d electron transport .",
    "we propose an expression for the density operator that is free from the mentioned shortcoming and calculate cdw contribution to the density response function .",
    "the imaginary part of the cdw susceptibility exists in the narrow band of wave numbers near  @xmath0 , whereas the smooth component produces a @xmath2-peak in the long - wave region .",
    "both cdw and smooth terms give , generally speaking , comparable contribution to the dissipative conductivity , which can be determined via the absorbed power .    in order to estimate cdw contribution to dissipative conductance",
    ", the following scheme of measurement was proposed .",
    "we consider the power dissipated in a 1d electron system , subjected to the local external potential that has a sufficiently large fourier - component at @xmath0 .",
    "short - scale field of this kind can be set up in reality , using near - field probing microscopy technique .",
    "our calculations lead to the unexpected conclusion , that cdw contribution to the conductivity dominates in the low - frequency limit over that of the commonly discussed smooth component of the density .",
    "in this section we show that a standard form of the density operator , describing cdw , is not consistent with the particle number conservation or , equivalently , with the total electroneutrality requirement .",
    "hence , it is to be altered .",
    "we aim to obtain an adequate expression for the 1d electron density operator .",
    "particle number conservation requires that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a density fluctuation at the position @xmath5 .",
    "this requirement can also be formulated for the susceptibility @xmath6 of the system to external potential . the susceptibility @xmath6 , defined by the linear relation between the fourier - transform of the density @xmath7 and the external potential @xmath8 via @xmath9 must have the following limit when @xmath10 : @xmath11{}0\\quad.\\ ] ] in the spinless luttinger model , the electron density operator @xmath12 is usually taken as  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a bosonic phase .",
    "two components in the electron density operator correspond to two kinds of the _ low - energy _",
    "pair excitations in a 1d system , shown in fig.[ex](a ) .",
    "the first component describes long - wave fluctuations , which are smooth on the @xmath1 scale and small as compared to background density @xmath15 .",
    "this part of the electron density operator represents the sum of the densities of right- and left - moving @xmath16-fermions ( denoted by @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xcite it is essential , that the corresponding pair excitations come about separately within each branch of the luttinger liquid spectrum , and transfer momentum @xmath18 . the second ( cdw )",
    "component of the electron density operator is due to the interference of the left- and right - moving electrons .",
    "this term describes excitations , transferring momentum @xmath19 .",
    "it is easily seen that the form of the smooth density component @xmath20 obeys the particle number conservation requirement .",
    "the integral of @xmath21 is zero in consequence of boundary conditions : @xmath22 the corresponding susceptibility @xmath23 indeed goes to zero , when @xmath24 , as can be seen from the expression for @xmath23 given in ref .",
    "( see also eq .",
    "( [ smsus ] ) below ) .",
    "however , the cdw part of the electron density operator does not exhibit such a property !",
    "the integral of @xmath25 is not zero : @xmath26 this implies that the integral of the average density @xmath27 over @xmath5 , generally speaking , is not zero too .",
    "it is for this reason that the susceptibility @xmath28 calculated with the density operator ( [ lutt_dens ] ) does not go to zero when @xmath29 , as we show in section  [ sectcdw ] .",
    "consequently , the above expression for @xmath30 and the corresponding density response function @xmath31 contradict to particle number conservation and do not correctly describe 1d electron transfer .    in order to understand the reasons of this failure",
    ", we ought to turn to the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ lutt_dens ] ) for the electron density operator in the luttinger model .    the field operator @xmath32 of electron system",
    "is known to be non - locally connected with that of @xmath16-fermion one @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite however , in the _ low - energy _ approximation it is usually taken as @xmath34 this local expression for a field operator leads to the electron density operator of eq .",
    "( [ lutt_dens ] ) , which does not conserve the number of particles .",
    "the electroneutrality is violated because the consistent low - energy expansion of @xmath32 has not been done . in order to find the proper form of the operator",
    ", one can either use the correct nonlocal expression for @xmath35 or try to find an adequate correction to the density operator of eq .",
    "( [ lutt_dens ] ) .",
    "we use the second option . keeping in mind that the density operator is a model one , we bring it to the exact differential form by adding the lower order term in the low - energy expansion : @xmath36 this form of the cdw operator guarantees the number of particles to be conserved .",
    "the integral of corrected @xmath30 is zero in consequence of boundary conditions , and the susceptibility has a correct long - wave limit : @xmath37 when @xmath24 .",
    "another derivation of the density operator , conserving the number of particles , was given by haldane .",
    "@xcite he suggested to take a function @xmath38 that increases by @xmath39 on each encountered electron .",
    "then the electron density operator is presented as @xmath40 if we associate @xmath38 with @xmath41 , then the first term of eq .",
    "( [ halfor ] ) gives the smooth part of the density in eq .",
    "( [ lutt_dens ] ) .",
    "the first harmonic ( @xmath42 ) of eq .",
    "( [ halfor ] ) coincides with eq .",
    "( [ rho_cdw ] ) in form , but differs by a factor of two .    in section [ sectcdw ] we show that the density response , calculated with operator of eq .",
    "( [ rho_cdw ] ) , gives the correct transition to the limiting case of noninteracting electrons .",
    "by contrast , eq .  ( [ halfor ] ) and the conventional expression  ( [ lutt_dens ] ) for the cdw operator fail to give this transition .",
    "thus , the bosonized density operator  ( [ rho_cdw ] ) of cdw component is consistent with particle conservation and can be used to describe correctly the density response of interacting electrons .",
    "in this section the contribution of the cdw and smooth components of the density to the linear response function and to the dissipative conductance is explored . to be specific ,",
    "we consider the system , illustrated by fig .",
    "[ pict1 ] , that comprises the gated quantum wire and the conducting tip .",
    "the tip allows one to act locally on the electrons in the wire by ac - potential .",
    "such a configuration is very interesting in view of the rapid progress of near - field microscopy technique .",
    "this system is close to the metal - carbon nanotube - tip structure considered recently by y.  xue and s.  datta  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the following hierarchy of the scales takes place : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the diameter of the quantum wire , @xmath45 is the distance between the wire and the gate , and @xmath46 is the distance between the tip and the wire .",
    "the first pair of inequalities allows one to consider electrons in the wire as a 1d system with short - range interaction .",
    "the right inequality means that the influence of the tip is much weaker than that of the gate .",
    "thus the presence of the tip does not affect electron - electron interaction and the ground state of 1d electrons is uniform .",
    "when ac - voltage is applied to the tip , the electrons in the wire are subjected to the electric potential @xmath47 , which is localized in space : @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath49 , the power dissipated in the system is shown in appendix a to be @xmath50    the conductance of a mesoscopic structure is determined usually through the current and the voltage applied across the leads . since no current - carrying leads are taken into our consideration , it is the dissipated power that determines the conductivity via @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an external potential amplitude in the wire .",
    "@xcite    let us study the contribution of both electron density components to the susceptibility and conductivity .",
    "the density response function is found via kubo formula with the density operator @xmath53 , @xmath54 being defined in eq .",
    "( [ rho_cdw ] ) .      the density response function , corresponding to @xmath55 , is well investigated .",
    "@xcite nevertheless it is given below to demonstrate that the total electroneutrality is kept , and to compare the dynamics of smooth density response with that of cdw : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the interaction parameter and @xmath58 is the velocity of boson excitations .",
    "@xcite it is obvious that the integral of @xmath59 over @xmath5 is zero at every moment of time .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath60 goes to zero , when @xmath24 .",
    "this means that the number of particles is conserved .",
    "( [ smdyn ] ) shows that the evolution of the electron density fluctuation , generated by the local disturbance of the form @xmath61 , is presented by two wave fronts propagating in opposite directions with a constant amplitude and the velocity @xmath58 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ smfig ] . these waves transfer charge and produce current .",
    "the fact that electron current depends on the position @xmath5 along the 1d conductor should not be perceived as a confusing one .",
    "it does not contradict to the general requirement of the electrodynamics according to which the total current @xmath62 must be conserved , _",
    "i.e. _ be independent of  @xmath5 .",
    "the current conservation is obeyed if we take into account the displacement current .",
    "it was shown in ref . that the displacement current between the 1d conductor and the gate ensures the total current conservation .",
    "the dissipated power due to the smooth density component is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the fourier - component of @xmath47 at @xmath65 .",
    "now we turn to cdw contribution to electron transport .",

    "the dependence of the imaginary part of the cdw susceptibility on the wave number @xmath82 is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] for several values of interaction parameter .",
    "it is seen that , in contrast to the noninteracting case , the inclusion of electron - electron interaction leads to the qualitative change in the shape of @xmath83 and to the increase of @xmath83 with interaction strength .",
