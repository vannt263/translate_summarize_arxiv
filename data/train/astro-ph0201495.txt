    "the fraction of absorbed agns , especially luminous absorbed agns , is one of a big issue in understanding the true number density of active nuclei in the universe .",
    "recently many candidates of absorbed luminous agns are found in agn surveys in radio , x - ray , and near - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , webster et al .",
    "the discoveries imply that we have been missing significant fraction of nucleus with high activity in traditional optical / uv - selections of agns due to absorption to the nucleus .",
    "however the fraction of the absorbed agn in the entire agn population is not clear .",
    "radio - selected samples are affected by red agns with red synchrotron component ( francis et al .",
    "2001 ) , soft x - ray selection is biased against heavily absorbed agns ( kim & elvis 1999 ) , and 2mass - selected red agns are limited in the low redshift universe ( cutri et al . in this volume ) .    in order to construct a complete sample of agns",
    "less biased against absorption to nucleus , we conduct optical follow - up observations for _ asca _ large sky survey ( hereafter alss ; ueda et al .",
    "1999 ) and _ asca _ medium sensitivity survey ( hereafter amss ; ueda et al .",
    "2001 ) in the hard x - ray band .",
    "hard x - ray emission can penetrate the obscuring matter of absorbed agns and is very suitable in searching absorbed agns .",
    "using 210  kev hard x - ray emission , we can detect agns with x - ray absorption up to hydrogen column density of 10@xmath4 @xmath3 , which corresponds to @xmath5 of 20 @xmath6 50 with galactic conversion factor , without bias .",
    "alss is a survey in a continuous field with 5.4 square degree near the north galactic pole .",
    "we selected 34 x - ray sources detected with sis 27  kev significance larger than 3.5@xmath7 .",
    "the sources are identified with 30 agns , 2 clusters of galaxies and 1 galactic star ( akiyama et al . 2000 ) .",
    "one x - ray source with hard spectrum is still unidentified , and _",
    "follow - up observation is planed in cycle 3 .",
    "amss is a serendipitous source survey based on _ asca _ pointing observations conducted in high galactic latitude region ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we conducted optical follow - up observations for 86 x - ray sources detected with gis 210  kev significance larger than 5.6@xmath7 in the northern sky ( declination above @xmath9 ; we call amssn sample ) .",
    "all of the x - ray sources are identified with 78 agns , 7 clusters of galaxies , and 1 galactic star ( akiyama et al . in preparation ) . in total , we constructed sample of 108 hard x - ray selected agns with the flux limit of _ asca _ , about @xmath10 erg s@xmath2 @xmath3 in the 210  kev band . in figure 1 , we plotted the hard x - ray flux vs. optical magnitude ( left ) and the redshift vs. luminosity distribution ( right ) diagrams of alss and amssn agns .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "samples are two orders of magnitude brighter and more luminous than the sample of deep _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ surveys , and consists of luminous agns , i.e. , qsos , in the universe below redshift 1 .",
    "the high completeness of the _ asca _ samples makes us possible to discuss the fraction of absorbed agns definitely .",
    "using the hardness of x - ray spectrum of each source , we can estimate the x - ray absorption to the nucleus in each object .",
    "the 0.710  kev apparent photon index distributions of alss and amssn agns are plotted as a function of redshift in left panel of figure 2 . the upper and lower solid lines in the figure correspond to the apparent photon index of an object with intrinsic photon index of 1.7 and x - ray absorption with hydrogen column density of @xmath11(@xmath3 ) and @xmath12(@xmath3 ) at each redshift , respectively . the x - ray sources with apparent photon index smaller than 1 can be regarded as significantly harder than canonical power - law spectra of broad - line agns ( with photon index of 1.7 ) .",
    "they correspond to intermediate redshift agns with x - ray absorption of @xmath13(@xmath3 ) and high - redshift agns with absorption of @xmath14(@xmath3 ) . at high - redshift ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "the apparent photon indexes of highly absorbed objects become close to that of object without absorption , because we observe very high energy photons of the source - frame , which are less affected by absorption than low - energy photons .",
    "based on the estimated amount of absorption to nucleus , we examine the fraction of absorbed agns in the hard x - ray selected agns . for simplicity , we limit the sample below redshift of 0.6 , and regard agns with @xmath16(@xmath3 ) as significantly absorbed agns . it should be noted that at high - redshifts ( @xmath17 ) agns with hydrogen column density of @xmath18 ( @xmath3 ) can not be regarded as significantly absorbed in the current sample . in right panel of figure 2 ,",
    "the luminosity distribution of the all agns and significantly absorbed agns from combination of the alss , amssn , and _ asca _ deep survey in the lockman hole ( adsl ; ishisaki et al .",
    "2001 ) is plotted .",
    "the fraction of absorbed agns is higher in the lowest luminosity range , but there is no clear deficiency of absorbed agn above 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath2 , which is observed in the alss sample ( akiyama et al .",
    "the fraction of absorbed agn are 6/36 and 5/39 in the luminosity between 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath2 and 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath2 and in the luminosity above 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the fraction of absorbed agns is higher in the luminosity range below 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath2 ( 3/6 ) than in the luminosity range above , but the number of agns in the low luminosity range is fairly limited .",
    "the fraction of luminous ( @xmath21 erg s@xmath2 ) agns with @xmath22(@xmath3 ) in the sample of agns without bias up to @xmath23(@xmath3 ) ( @xmath615% ) is clearly smaller than that expected from the models of cosmic x - ray background ( 45% ; comastri et al .",
    "1995 ) or that observed in local low - luminosity seyfert galaxies ( 40% ; risaliti et al .",
    "the fraction of absorbed qsos is not as large as expected , but we detected several candidates of absorbed qsos in _ asca _ surveys .",
    "their counterparts are relatively faint and have larger x - ray to optical flux ratio than normal agns ( see dotted objects in left panel of figure 2 ) .",
    "most of high - redshift agns with hard x - ray spectra have large x - ray to optical flux ratios . the x - ray to optical flux ratio",
    "is similar to those of optically - faint hard x - ray source population found in deep _",
    "chandra _ surveys ( see left panel of figure 1 ; e.g. , alexander et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the _ asca _ optically - faint agns can be low - redshift and/or high - luminosity cousin of the _ chandra _ population .    although measured amount of x - ray absorption is large , most of the luminous absorbed qsos show broad mgii 2800 or h@xmath24 6563 emission line .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy can be 1 ) broad mgii 2800 from scattered nuclear light or 2 ) discrepancy between amount of x - ray photoelectric absorption and optical dust reddening .",
    "we show two examples of absorbed qsos fall in each category .",

    "its x - ray luminosity is estimated to be @xmath26 erg s@xmath2 , which corresponds to the luminosities of qsos .",
    "the observed x - ray spectrum of the object in a 0.710  kev band is described by intrinsic absorption with a hydrogen column density of @xmath27 @xmath3 and an intrinsic photon index of 1.7 .",
    "the hydrogen column density corresponds to the lower edge of the column density distribution of seyfert 1.8 - 1.9 galaxies .",
    "the optical spectrum of the object shows strong emission lines , such as broad mgii 2800 , narrow [ oii ] 3727 , and narrow [ oiii ] 5007 , but no broad h@xmath28 emission line ( see right panel of figure 3 ) .",
    "its small h@xmath28-to-[oiii ] 5007 equivalent width ratio is comparable to those of seyfert 1.8 - 2 galaxies .",
    "optical and near - infrared images show nuclear and extended components ( see left panel of figure 3 ) . because the nuclear component has very red @xmath29 color but blue @xmath30 and @xmath31 colors , the nucleus is thought to be absorbed with @xmath32 and emerge only in the @xmath33-band ( akiyama and ohta 2001 ) .",
    "the amount of absorption is consistent with the amount of x - ray absorption .",
    "the optical blue continuum and broad mgii 2800 emission line can originate from scattered nuclear light ( akiyama et al .",
    "2001 ) .",

    "recently , deep _",
    "chandra _ hard x - ray spectrum and ircs / subaru @xmath35-band spectrum of the object are obtained ( akiyama et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the 0.510  kev 150ks _ chandra _ spectrum of ax  j08494 + 4454 is hard , and is explained well with a power - law continuum absorbed by a hydrogen column density of @xmath36 @xmath3 .",
    "the 210  kev luminosity of the object is estimated to be @xmath37 erg s@xmath2 , after correcting the absorption , and reaches hard x - ray luminosities of qsos . the large x - ray absorption and the large intrinsic luminosity support the original identification of ax  j08494 + 4454 as a type-2 radio - quiet qso .",
    "nevertheless , deep subaru / ircs @xmath35-band spectroscopic observation suggests the presence of a strong broad h@xmath24 emission line from ax  j08494 + 4454 ( left panel of figure 4 ) .",
    "the broad h@xmath24 emission line has a velocity width of @xmath38 km s@xmath2 , which corresponds to a typical broad - balmer line velocity width of a luminous qso .",
    "the existence of the strong broad h@xmath24 line means that the object is not a type-2 qso , but a luminous cousin of a seyfert 1.9 galaxy in the source - frame optical spectrum .",
    "the balmer decrement of broad lines , the broad h@xmath24 emission to the hard x - ray luminosity ratio , and optical sed ( right panel of figure 4 ) suggest that the nucleus is affected by dust extinction with @xmath39 of @xmath40 mag in the optical wavelength .",
    "the estimated amount of dust extinction is much smaller than that expected from the x - ray column density ( @xmath41 mag ) .",
    "the discrepancy can be explained with a smaller dust to gas mass ratio which may due to dust sublimation in the x - ray absorbing matter , the size difference between optical and x - ray emitting region , or different dust size distribution in agns ( e.g. , maiolino et al .",
