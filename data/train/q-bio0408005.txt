    "ecological systems exhibit a large number of associations of certain species which coexist on the same territory .",
    "these associations can be considered as evolutionary stable states ( or nash equilibria ) whose stability and competitiveness depend on the environmental conditions @xcite .",
    "generally , the systematic analysis of the competition between these spatial states is made difficult by the complexity of the phenomena and by the large number of parameters in the suitable models .    in order to have a deeper insight into these phenomena we consider now a family of toy models exemplifying some basic features and the richness of possible behaviors . in these predator - prey models",
    "the species , located on the sites of a lattice , invades one of the neighboring sites if it is occupied by its prey .",
    "the investigation of predator - prey systems on lattices has a long history reviewed recently in the papers @xcite . in these systems",
    "the invasion processes can yield extinction of species and/or maintain some steady states in the spatial distribution if the corresponding food web ( a directed graph ) contains loops .",
    "in such a situation a self - organizing spatio - temporal pattern can be formed by the species dominating cyclically each other . besides it , in the present model",
    "the neutral ( neighboring ) species are allowed to exchange their sites .",
    "this latter process helps the formation of many well - mixed distributions of neutral species which can also protect each other against the rest of species . as a result",
    "these models possess many final states toward which such a system can evolve . in the spatial systems these states can coexist by forming domains if the system is started from a random initial state for sufficiently large sizes . the competition between these multi - species associations along the boundaries can affect their internal structure and the evolutionary process selects one of these states .",
    "thus , the investigation of these simplified models can help us to clarify some mechanisms related to darwinian selection @xcite and the emergence of structural complexity @xcite characterizing _ pre - biotic _ evolution too @xcite .",
    "several basic features are already well known for the simplest versions of the above models . as mentioned above ,",
    "if the spatial predator - prey model on the square lattice contains three species with cyclic dominance ( this model is also called as spatial rock - scissors - paper game ) then the cyclic invasions maintain a self - organizing pattern with equal species concentrations @xcite . both the composition @xcite and the geometrical features @xcite of this spatial pattern are affected by the independent variation of invasion rates meanwhile this structure provides a stability against some external invaders @xcite .",
    "similar self - organizing pattern is found for those cyclic predator - prey ( or voter ) models where the number @xmath1 of species is limited , namely @xmath2 @xcite . for even @xmath1 , however , these systems are very sensitive to the independent variation of invasion rates @xcite .",
    "more complex behavior was observed for those systems where the food web consists of several cycles that can be distinguished from a topological point of view @xcite . in these multi - cycle ecological models the final ( stationary ) state",
    "is prevailed by a defensive alliance being the most stable cyclic subsystem .",
    "these defensive alliances are composed of those species that form a cycle in the food web thereby their spatial distribution is equivalent to those of one - cycle systems mentioned above .",
    "the privileged role of these associations is related to their most effective protection , provided by the topological features of the food web , against the external species . in their enhanced protection",
    "the role of spatial structure is crucial because under mean - field conditions these associations are not able to eliminate the external invaders .",
    "very recently the investigation of a four - species cyclic predator - prey model has indicated the spontaneous formation of another type of defensive alliances @xcite . in this latter model",
    "the lattice sites can be empty and the individuals are allowed to jump to one of the neighboring empty sites . as a result the odd ( even )",
    "label species can form a well - mixed state ensuring the possibility of prompt counter - attack against the even ( odd ) label species and by this means these associations can defend their territories . in other words , the neutral species can also form defensive alliances in the presence of some local mixing .",
    "in the present paper we consider a set of models allowing the appearance of both types of above mentioned defensive alliances . in these six - species models",
    "the food web contains many cycles and the local mixing is provided by a site exchange between the neutral pairs .",
    "for all the models the probability @xmath0 of site exchange will be the only tunable parameter .",
    "using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations it will be shown that , despite their simplicity , these models are able to account different stationary states and subsequent phase transitions when varying the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the stationary states are composed of different species whose number varies from 2 to 6 .",
    "evidently , the time scales of the formation of these states are dependent on the microscopic mechanism ( invasion or mixing ) .",
    "sometimes equivalent states are formed via a nucleation mechanism and they can destroy each other ( cyclically ) when the boundaries of these growing domains meet .",
    "apparently the combination of our previous models @xcite means a simple extension of the six - species models .",
    "this extension , however , exemplifies that a small variation of a sufficiently complex ecological model can yield surprisingly large increase in the types of behaviors and phase transitions whose clarification raises many other questions . at the same time , many aspects of these features seem to be valid for the sufficiently complex ecological systems ( or evolutionary games ) as discussed in the conclusions .",
    "in all the present models the site @xmath3 of a square lattice is occupied by an individual belonging to one of the six species and the corresponding distribution is given by a set of site variables ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the predator - prey relation between the species is defined by a food web . on the corresponding directed graph",
    "the nodes ( labelled from 0 to 5 ) refer to the species and the directed edges point to the prey from its predator .",
    "our analysis is focused on those systems where each species has two predators , two prey , and a neutral one ( not linked ) . in this case each possible food web ( satisfying the above conditions ) is isomorphic to one of the four graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : foodweb ] and the corresponding model is named after their labels a , b , c , and d @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the species distribution is governed by iterating nearest neighbor invasions and site exchanges .",
    "more precisely , starting from a random initial state we repeat the following steps : 1 ) two nearest - neighbor sites are chosen at random ; 2 ) if these sites are occupied by a predator - prey pair then the prey is killed and an offspring of the predator occupies the site of prey ; 3 ) for neutral pairs the species exchange their sites with a probability @xmath0 .",
    "evidently , nothing happens if the individuals belong to the same species .",
    "for example , in the model a the randomly chosen pair @xmath5 transforms into @xmath6 ( invasion ) and the pair @xmath7 transform to @xmath8 ( site exchange ) with a probability @xmath0 , otherwise the neutral pair remains unchanged .",
    "notice that the invasion rates between the predator - prey pairs are unique and the models have only one parameter ( @xmath0 ) characterizing the strength of mixing between the neutral species .",
    "these models are investigated by a series of mc simulations performed on a square lattice with sites @xmath9 under periodic boundary conditions at different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the simulations are started from a random initial state . within a time unit ( mcs )",
    "each pair has a chance once on the average to perform an invasion ( between predator and prey ) or a site exchange with a probability @xmath0 ( between neutral species ) . during the simulations we have recorded the current values of species concentrations [ @xmath10 ; @xmath11 as well as the probability of finding predator - prey [ @xmath12 and neutral pairs @xmath13 on two neighboring sites .",
    "the stationary states are characterized by the averages values of these quantities ( denoted as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) which are determined by averaging over a long sampling time varied from @xmath17 to @xmath18 mcs after a suitable thermalization time .",
    "evidently , @xmath19 and the quantity @xmath20 gives the probability of finding the same species on two neighboring sites .",
    "at the same time we have determined the fluctuation of these quantities defined as @xmath21 $ ] where @xmath22 refers to the averaging over the sampling time . to avoid undesired size effects the linear size",
    "is varied from @xmath23 to 2500 .",
    "the larger sizes are used in the close vicinity of transition points where the fluctuations diverge .",
    "now we discuss the general features of the possible stationary states .",
    "for all these models there exist six homogeneous states denoted as @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) for each site @xmath3 .",
    "these states remain unchanged and the evolution of the species distribution is stopped whenever one of these ( absorbing ) states is reached . at the same time , the homogeneous state is unstable against the invasion of the suitable predators .    the mixed states of neutral species are denoted as @xmath27 if @xmath28 or 3 .",
    "evidently there exist two additional neutral pairs for all the four models .",
    "in such a state there are no invasions at all .",
    "consequently , the ratio of populations is fixed during the evolution meanwhile the system tends towards an uncorrelated spatial distribution for @xmath29 .",
    "for all the four models there exist several three - species associations whose members invade cyclically each other .",
    "for example , in model @xmath30 one of the the corresponding states is denoted as @xmath31 where the subscripts refer to the three species being present with the same average concentrations , @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding spatial distribution is maintained by the cyclic invasions yielding a short average life time for the individuals ( the survival probability of individuals decreases exponentially with a relaxation time @xmath33 mcs ) and the correlation length ( @xmath34 ) is characterizing the typical domain size @xcite . in general , the stability of the possible three - species associations against the external invaders is determined by the food web topology @xcite . for the model",
    "@xmath30 the food web contains only two equivalent three - species cycles which are called defensive alliances because their members protect cyclically each other against the external invaders .",
    "for example , within the state @xmath31 the species @xmath35 can only be invaded by the `` external '' species @xmath36 . during the cyclic invasion processes both",
    "the internal species @xmath35 and the substituted invader @xmath36 are killed by their common predator ( @xmath37 ) , in the meantime the third member ( @xmath38 ) of the association feeds the species @xmath35 and blocks the spreading of invaders .",
    "thus , sooner or later the offspring of invaders will be eliminated from the system .",
    "one can easily check that other types ( @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) of invaders become extinct in the same way because of the cyclic symmetry in this food web . for the food web @xmath41",
    "the system has only one cyclic defensive alliance ( @xmath42 ) that will dominate the final stationary state although this food web has four additional three - species cycles with lower stability .",
    "model @xmath43 has eight equivalent three - species cycles , and neither of them can be considered as a defensive alliance in the sense mentioned above .",
    "model @xmath44 represents another situation where one can find four three - species and three four - species cycles . in this case the four - species cycle @xmath45 proved to be the most stable spatial association that satisfies the conditions to be a cyclic defensive alliance @xcite .    for @xmath46 , the stability of the different states is already determined in a previous study when considering the effect of mutations on the population in similar six - species predator - prey models @xcite .",
    "the present analysis will be focused on the effect of site exchange between the neutral pairs ( @xmath29 ) for the absence of mutation . for small sizes all the above mentioned states",
    "can be observed as a final state . for sufficiently large system sizes",
    ", however , the system tends towards the real stationary state independent of the initial state .",
    "in this section we study the behavior of several four - species subsystems whose understanding will help the interpretation of results obtained for the more complicated systems .",
    "more precisely , our analysis is focused on three systems ( labelled as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ) whose food web are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : foodwsub ] .",
    "the food web of subsystem @xmath47 is equivalent to a four - species cyclic predator - prey model where each species has only one predator and one prey .",
    "such a situation can occur in the models @xmath30 , @xmath41 , and @xmath44 if two species are missing , and its analysis becomes particularly important for model @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the stable state for @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , similar cyclic dominance has been reported very recently by traulsen _",
    "@xcite considering a four - strategy prisoner s dilemma game .    some features of this system",
    "is already investigated previously by several authors for @xmath46 @xcite . in this case",

    "@xmath16 characterize the concentration of interfaces separating neutral domains ( e.g. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "along these interfaces the evolution is blocked until one of the invading predators reaches the interface . for @xmath29 , however , along these neutral interfaces the site exchange increases the value of @xmath16 and supports the formation of the well - mixed phase of neutral species .",
    "the mc simulations indicate clearly how the value of @xmath16 increases monotonously with @xmath0 until a threshold value [ @xmath54 . at the same time",
    "the probability @xmath15 of predator - prey pairs is decreasing as shown in fig .",

    "finally , one of the two equivalent mixed states will prevail the whole finite system and then @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "subsystem @xmath48 represents the situation when the three - species cyclic defensive alliance ( @xmath61 ) is attacked by an external invader ( of type 0 ) .",

    "the average velocity of the interfaces ( separating the domains of @xmath56 and @xmath61 ) seems to be proportional to @xmath65 as it is observed for another model @xcite .",
    "this feature can explain why the ordering process becomes so slow in the close vicinity of the transition point .",
    "the four - species subsystem @xmath49 possesses two equivalent , three - species cycles that have two common species ( 1 and 3 ) . in this case",
    "the spatial distribution of species segregates into two types ( @xmath61 and @xmath66 ) of growing domains and finally the whole system is dominated by one of them with equal probabilities .",
    "notice that the bulk of these phases are not influenced by the site exchange mechanism whose effect is limited to the boundaries separating the phases @xmath61 and @xmath66 . furthermore the species within the mixed two - species phase @xmath56 are not able to protect each other because species 1 can invade their territories without restraint",
    "this is the reason why the domain growing process is not prevented for @xmath29 and the site exchange causes only a slight variation in the velocity of growing process .",
    "as mentioned above the six - species model @xmath30 has two equivalent three - species cycles consisting of disjoint sets of species , namely @xmath31 and @xmath42 . according to the simulations one of these phases ( with equal probability )",
    "will overwhelm the whole finite system after a domain growing process if the site exchange probability does not exceeds a threshold value , i.e. , @xmath67 . on a sufficiently large scale",
    "this domain growing process is similar to those that one can observe for the kinetic ising model below the critical temperature if the system is started from a random initial state ( for a survey of domain growth see @xcite ) .    above the threshold value ( @xmath68 ) the system develops into one of the three ( equivalent ) two - species states composed from neutral species .",
    "the topological features of the food web @xmath30 implies that the phases @xmath27 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 can also be considered as defensive alliances because their members protect each other against the external predators in the well - mixed state . during the transient time one can observe a domain growth with these three types of domains .",
    "apparently this growth is similar to those observed in the three - state potts model below the critical temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , along the interfaces separating two domains ( say @xmath27 and @xmath69 ) there occur a four - species cycle @xmath71 whose transversal extension is limited by invasions from both sides .",
    "notice that the corresponding four species subsystem ( see the food web @xmath47 in fig ,  [ fig : foodwsub ] ) exhibit a transition from the four - species cycle ( @xmath71 in the mentioned example ) to one of the mentioned neutral pair states at @xmath72 . as @xmath73 therefore the coexistence of the four species is limited to the narrow strips separating the well - mixed phases of the neutral pairs .",
    "the three - color maps have special points ( called three - edge vertices ) where three domains meet . instead of it , here there are patches with phases of either @xmath31 or @xmath42 .",

    "is found for @xmath16 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : betafit ] . at the same time",
    "the mc data show diverging fluctuations for these quantities that is another relevant feature of the critical transitions .",

    "the six species can coexist for a sufficiently long time in such a structure where the species with even labels are in minority .",

    "one of the relevant messages is related to the increase in the degree of freedom .",
    "many recent works are focused on spatial systems with one , two , or three species . for larger number of species",
    "the present models exemplify how the simple dynamical rules build up more complex objects ( alliances ) that can be considered as additional species participating in the evolutionary competition .",
    "shortly , the degree of freedom ( here the number of species ) is increased by the spontaneously occurring alliances having particular composition and spatial structure .",
    "one can believe that the food web of these systems should be extended by these complex objects ( with a suitable invasion rates ) to have a better picture about the whole spatial system .    in the context of game theory ( for details see the refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the interaction of species is described by the payoff matrix ( the adjacency matrix of the food web in the present models ) that determines the nash equilibrium from which the unilateral deviation yields loss . for many evolutionary ( dynamical ) rules",
    "the nash equilibrium represents an evolutionary stable state under the mean - field conditions .",
    "the nash equilibrium is not necessary unique and it can be a mixed state ( strategy ) . in the spatial models with short range interactions",
    "several species can be absent from a given territory and the nash equilibrium for the corresponding subsystem can be distinct from those characterizing the complete system .",
    "the noises affect the stability of these spatial states @xcite and modify the average velocity of invasions along the interfaces separating the competing phases @xcite .",
    "the above results justify that the invasion processes between the `` stable '' states of subsystems can play a crucial role in the formation of the final stationary states .    for many cases",
    "the final stationary state is reached through a coarsening process where the alliances ( degenerated nash equilibria ) form growing domains .",
    "the corresponding domain growth process is affected by the additional phases ( and mechanisms ) along interfaces .",
    "it is not yet known how these effects modify the growth process yielding significantly slower ( logarithmical ) domain growth .",
    "most of the ( first order ) transitions occur at such a value of @xmath0 where the invasion rate between two dominant alliances vanishes as detailed previously @xcite .",
    "remarkable exceptions are the fourth transition in model @xmath41 and the second one in model @xmath44 . in both cases",
    "more than one species die out simultaneously and their extinction is accompanied by an enhanced concentration fluctuation for the surviving species and the resultant spatio - temporal structures can mediate unusual interactions between the vanishing species .",
    "these transitions are distinct inherently and their classification requires further time - consuming numerical investigations .",
    "the spontaneous formation of complex spatio - temporal structures is one of the most interesting predictions of these simple models because it sustains an abundance of species .",
    "furthermore , this feature mixes the concept of the part and whole . at the same time",
    "the corresponding system can be interpreted as a set of objects that create objects in a way characterizing the living systems @xcite . in the light of the present results one can easily imagine that the choice of more complex food webs can result in the emergence of more and more complex objects ( e.g. , alliances of alliances with particular spatio - temporal structures ) .",
    "besides it these models imply the possibility that the evolution of food web by mutations @xcite and the evolution of the spatial ecological system are strongly related to each other while the spatial inhomogeneity can be enhanced in the system .",
    "supports from the hungarian national research fund ( t-47003 ) and the european science foundation ( cost p10 ) are acknowledged ."
