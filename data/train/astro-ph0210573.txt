    "it is now fairly well established that most or all bulges contain supermassive black holes @xcite . within the last two years it has become clear that the mass of the black hole ( bh ) is related to the velocity dispersion of the bulge of the host galaxy .",
    "this relationship has less scatter than a previously noted relationship between the black hole mass and the bulge light @xcite .",
    "it has also been known for some time that the masses , and cosmic mass density of bhs , crudely correspond to the masses and numbers predicted by the luminous output of quasars , under the assumption that they are powered by accreting black holes with radiative efficiencies near 10% . published estimates of the bh mass density predicted by quasars",
    "are around @xmath2 @xcite , while estimates from the x - ray background tend to be larger . using the x - ray background , @xcite obtain an estimate of @xmath3 , while @xcite estimate the mass density to be @xmath4 .",
    "it is useful to note that the above density estimates are independent of the hubble constant or cosmological model ( so long as it is general relativistic , isotropic and homogeneous ) because they can be cast in terms of the surface brightness of quasar light on the sky , and hence determine its local energy density .",
    "since the mass density of the radiating objects declines as the universe expands as @xmath5 and the photon energy of their radiation declines as @xmath6 , the only cosmological correction connecting the observed radiation to the local bh density is @xmath7 , where z is the redshift of the epoch of the emission of the radiation .    on the other hand ,",
    "the local density of supermassive bhs are obtained by multiplying the density of galaxies by the typical bh mass per galaxy .",
    "@xcite used the bh mass - bulge luminosity relationship , together with the @xcite estimate of the luminosity density in galaxies , to estimate the local density of bhs ; for a hubble constant of 80 km / s / mpc this is @xmath8 .",
    "more recently , @xcite estimated this same quantity using the newer @xmath9 relation .",
    "their approach was to use the @xmath9 relation to calibrate a mass - luminosity relation and then multiply by the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "in this paper we take an alternate approach .",
    "we use multiple estimates of the luminosity functions of galaxies for different hubble types , together with estimates of bulge luminosity as a function of hubble type , together with observed relationships between luminosity and velocity dispersions or rotation velocity , to construct a velocity function ( the number of galaxies per magnitude per unit volume ) for bulges as a function of hubble type .",
    "this function can then be used together with the @xmath10 relation to estimate bh mass functions .",
    "our basic result using this procedure is that the mean mass density of supermassive bhs is @xmath11 .",
    "after we completed much of the analysis in this paper , we became aware of an estimate by @xcite based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , that gives an estimate of @xmath12 . by assuming that h=0.65 , as in their paper , our results are comparable with theirs . the rather surprising conclusions about the radiative efficiency of quasars derived by @xcite from their low value of @xmath13 illustrate the importance of an improved estimate of this parameter .",
    "the basic assumption underlying this note is that the bulge velocity dispersion of a galaxy can be used to predict the mass of its supermassive black hole . under that assumption ,",
    "the best way to proceed would be to directly observe velocity dispersions of a volume  limited sample of galaxy bulges and to integrate over the implied distribution .",
    "such a catalogue might well exist in the future , but at present we adopt a simpler expediency .",
    "we use a power law @xcite to convert various luminosity functions to a `` dispersion function '' , and the @xmath10 relation for black holes to convert the dispersion function to a bh mass function .    in general ,",
    "if there are @xmath14 galaxies per cubic megaparsec brighter than a luminosity @xmath15 , then the luminosity function is @xmath16 this can be directly converted to the bh mass function by using the derivative of the relationship between luminosity and the velocity dispersion ( @xmath17 ) and the black hole mass ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath17 for bulges . without any loss of generality",
    ", it can be written as @xmath19    since in what follows we will rely on luminosity functions due to @xcite , we adopt his parameterization of the luminosity function of different types of galaxies as schechter functions and adopt power laws for the two relationships . to simplify the algebra we normalize luminosity , dispersion and black hole mass by their values at the fiducial luminosity of the schechter function @xmath20 , as follows @xmath21    we then can write the schechter parameterization and the relationships between luminosity and dispersion and dispersion and @xmath18 as @xmath22 with @xmath23 in @xmath24 .",
    "substituting these equations into equation 2 gives the following dispersion function @xmath25 with @xmath26 and the following mass function for supermassive black holes @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "unless explicitly parametrized by h = @xmath31 , all calculations were done assuming @xmath32 .",
    "in order to determine the number density as a function of dispersion , the schechter function fits , valid for @xmath33 ( corresponding to @xmath34 km / s and @xmath35 for an elliptical galaxy ) , obtained by @xcite , were modified using the corresponding bulge to total galaxy luminosity ratios , calculated from the data given in @xcite for the appropriate galaxy range , as given in table 1 , to produce a fit as a function of the bulge - only luminosity for the spiral galaxies : @xmath36 a power - law relation of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 refers to the total luminosity ratio for the elliptical galaxies and to the bulge - only luminosity ratio for the spiral galaxies , may be used to convert the function of luminosity ( 6 , 11 ) to one of dispersion such that @xmath39 with @xmath26 .    to obtain a value for the parameter @xmath40 for each galaxy type ,",
    "the parameter @xmath41 from the @xcite schechter function fits are converted to the equivalent dispersion , @xmath40 using a relationship between the magnitude and the dispersion given by @xcite .",
    "the `` best '' relationship between magnitude and dispersion , selected from several in this paper , was determined by @xcite to be : @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this results in a slope for the power - law relation ( 13 ) of @xmath45 .",
    "however , this equation is in the @xmath46 magnitude system , and so must be converted into the zwicky magnitude system in order to be combined with the @xcite schechter function fitting parameters . despite concerns that there may not be a linear relationship between these two magnitude systems @xcite , an approximate conversion was adopted by combining the conversion given in @xcite @xmath47 with that given in @xcite @xmath48 to obtain @xmath49 which allows the magnitude - dispersion relation to be written as @xmath50 this relation may then be combined with the @xcite magnitude correction for the bulge - to - total galaxy magnitude ratio , @xmath51 , so that only the @xmath52 is used to calculate the dispersion for the spiral galaxies , such that @xmath53 hence , the velocity dispersion , @xmath54 , may be expressed as @xmath55 with @xmath56    the number density as a function of dispersion ( 14 ) may then be combined with the relation between the dispersion and the black hole mass given by @xcite , corrected from h=0.8 ( to h=1 ) for consistency , @xmath57 ( with @xmath58 ) to obtain the final equation for the number density as a function of black hole mass : @xmath59 again with @xmath28 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 this method of calculating @xmath63 , rather than directly applying a relationship between @xmath64 , was used because @xcite indicate that there is a tighter correlation between @xmath65 than between @xmath64 .    using expression ( 24 ) for the number density , an expression for the total mass density of black holes",
    "may be obtained by integrating the function @xmath66 from an assumed minimum black hole mass to an infinite black hole mass for each galaxy type , and then summing the results to obtain an estimate for the total mass density of black holes .",
    "the calculation was done adopting a minimum black hole mass limit of @xmath67 , which results in a total mass density for all galaxy types of @xmath68 the results of this calculation are given in table 2 ; along with the number density function fitting parameters for each galaxy type . the uncertainties and average values given for each of these parameters",
    "were derived using a monte carlo analysis , with the largest source of uncertainty stemming from the bulge - to - total galaxy luminosity ratios given in table 1 .",
    "figures 1 - 4 show histograms of the resulting densities from the monte carlo calculation , which illustrate that the median value for the density tends to be slightly lower than the average value , but still well within the stated uncertainties of the density , with a relatively symmetric distribution of densities .",
    "the calculation of the mass density was then redone using exactly the same method , but utilizing completely different galaxy luminosity functions obtained from @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the galaxies were divided into subsets based on spectral type , @xmath69 , rather than by hubble t - type .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 is determined based on the absorption and emission line strengths in the galaxy spectrum . in order to apply the method developed in this paper , it was necessary to convert the spectral types into t - types so that the appropriate bulge - to - total luminosity conversions could be applied .",
    "this was done by utilizing the data given in figure 4 of @xcite which showed the correlation between @xmath69 and morphological type , and assuming a relatively even distribution of @xmath69 over t - types . for the luminosity function",
    "designated as type 1 ( @xmath70 ) , an assumption was made that galaxies were evenly divided between elliptical , s0 , and sa galaxies for the purposes of this calculation .",
    "the resulting mass density obtained using the @xcite luminosity functions is @xmath71 with the results for the individual spectral types given in table 3 .",
    "this is slightly larger than the result obtained using the marzke functions ; however , it is strongly dependent on the assumptions made regarding the division into morphological type , particularly of the @xcite type 1 galaxies .",
    "if is is assumed that all of the type 1 galaxies are elliptical , the resulting mass density becomes @xmath72 , if it is assumed that they are all s0 galaxies then the mass density becomes @xmath73 , and if it is assumed that they are all sa galaxies , then the mass density is calculated to be @xmath74 .",
    "considering the uncertainties in using the @xcite spectral type classifications for the purpose of applying a bulge - to - disk luminosity correction , these results are consistent with those obtained using @xcite . also of importance",
    "is the fact that @xcite specifically take into account issues of malmquist bias when determining their luminosity functions .",
    "@xcite make no mention of this .",
    "therefore , it appears that this possible omission will not have a significant impact on the final density of black holes .",
    "in table 2 , as expected , the ellipticals have the largest central black hole mass , @xmath63 , values , while later - type galaxies have increasingly smaller @xmath63 values , corresponding to their smaller relative bulge sizes . plots of the number function ( figure 5 ) and the mass function ( figure 6 ) illustrate that the contribution from the s0 galaxies dominates at low @xmath75 , while the ellipticals dominate for high @xmath75 values .",
    "overall , the strongest contribution to the total mass density is from s0 galaxies , with important contributions from the elliptical and sa - sb galaxies , but a small contribution from the sc - sd galaxies .",
    "the total cosmic mass density of black holes of @xmath1 obtained from this calculation is relatively independent of several of the adopted parameters .",
    "as illustrated by figure 7 , decreasing the lower limit of integration in the calculation of the mass density does not significantly change the resulting mass density estimate .",
    "this is because the black holes located in small - bulge galaxies are , themselves , small , and there are not enough small - bulge galaxies to make up in number for this lack in mass .",
    "this is further illustrated by the flat slope in the plot of the mass function ( figure 6 ) .",
    "similarly , altering the value of @xmath76 , the power law index , in the relationship between the black hole mass , @xmath75 , and the velocity dispersion , @xmath17 ( eqns 5 & 8) , has a small effect on the final density .",
    "this is because most of the contribution is in the range of @xmath77 - the same region in which the @xmath78 for this relation is located , and in which the relationship is determined best . a perturbation in the power law index for masses near this mass will have little effect on the final answer .",
    "changing the zero - point , however , would have a roughly linear effect on the resulting mass density , although for the currently accepted relationships , the differences in the zero - point are small . redoing the calculation using the best - estimate @xcite relation stating that @xmath79 instead of the @xcite relation ( 23 ) , produces a result of @xmath80 , which agrees well with our previous estimate .",
    "this estimate for the mass density also agrees , within the limits of the uncertainty , with that given in the @xcite paper of @xmath81 .    the parameters with the most significant impact on the resulting density , other than the @xmath10 relationship from @xcite and the schechter functions from @xcite , are the assumptions about the morphological distributions of galaxies and the resulting bulge - to - disk luminosity corrections , adopted from @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated by the results obtained using the galaxy luminosity functions from @xcite instead of @xcite . by assigning a different morphological distribution to the @xcite type 1 luminosity function galaxies ,",
    "the resulting mass density varies by a factor of approximately 2.5 . given this uncertainty in the mass density resulting from the calculation using the @xcite data , we are more confident in our estimates derived from the @xcite luminosity functions .",
    "the schechter function fits may be less applicable in the low - black - hole mass regime , particularly for @xmath82 , and to a lesser degree for galaxies with @xmath83 . while there is information on black holes down to @xmath84 , in our own galaxy and m32",
    ", the schechter function fits may not correctly apply to elliptical galaxies , may include two types of galaxies within one classification , or may mix exponential and de vaucouleurs - law galaxies together .",
    "we assume that while the schechter function fits for elliptical galaxies may be dominated by de galaxies at low luminosities , the same @xmath65 relationship is still applicable ; in our own galaxy and a small number of other galaxies with exponential profiles and measured black hole masses , this relationship appears to hold true .",
    "it must be noted that the resulting mass density of black holes may be an underestimate due to a possible bias in the relationship between the black hole mass and the galaxy velocity dispersion ( pointed out to us by dr .",
    "scott tremaine ) .",
    "this bias relates to the fact that for any given velocity dispersion , there is a range of black hole masses , and this distribution may not be symmetrical about the ridgeline .",
    "we have investigated this possible bias by assuming a log - normal distribution of black hole masses , with a disperson of 0.15 in the log space , and recomputing the black hole mass density .",
    "this results in a mass density of @xmath85 , which is 4 % larger than our original estimate .",
    "it is often useful to have a simple approximation available for crude calculations .",
    "while the number functions we have derived are not of the schechter form , we can find approximating functions of the form @xmath86 for the number function based on the @xcite data , the roll off at high mass is too gradual to be well - approximated by any function of the form ( 31 ) .",
    "we illustrate a fair fit in figure 8 .",
    "this fit , which works best near @xmath87 @xmath88 , where the information on the numbers of black holes is the most extensive , has the parameters ( c , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) @xmath91 .",
    "we can find a better fit to the number function produced by the @xcite luminosity function .",
    "it is shown in figure 9 .",
    "the parameters for this fit are ( c , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) @xmath92 .",
    "the recent paper by @xcite utilizes luminosity and velocity dispersion functions from early - type galaxies obtained as part of the sloan digital sky survey to perform a similar calculation .",
    "they obtain a result of @xmath93 .",
    "if we take h=0.65 to compare our result to @xcite , we obtain @xmath94 , which is in reasonable agreement with their result , particularly when the possible 4 % bias is taken into account .",
