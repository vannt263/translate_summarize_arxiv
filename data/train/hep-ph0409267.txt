    "it is well known that the standard quantum field theory ( qft ) is constructed within the framework of heisenberg algebra@xcite . therefore a possible way to construct a non - standard qft is through generalization of the heisenberg algebra .",
    "a generalized heisenberg algebra ( gha ) has recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "this generalized algebra has a characteristic function which depends on one of its generators .",
    "when this function is linear with slope @xmath1 , the algebra turns into a @xmath1-oscillator @xcite and it was shown @xcite that , for this case , it is possible to construct a generalized qft that describes at a space - time a composite particle . in ref@xcite",
    "the propagator , the first and second order scattering processes were computed and it was shown that the convergence of the perturbative series can be changed . however , other realizations of the gha have been presented in @xcite , the case where we have a nonlinear characteristic function .",
    "we will show , in this present work , that a self - consistent gqft can also be constructed in that case and as a consequence we have more parameters to fit experimental data .",
    "a detailed discussion comparing these two case will be presented ahead .",
    "the first step is to analyze the gha for a general characteristic function @xmath2 .",
    "as defined previously @xcite , this generalized heisenberg algebra is generated by three operators , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and described by the following relations    @xmath5 & = & f(j_0)-j_0   \\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 means hermitian conjugate and by hypothesis , @xmath7 and @xmath2 is an arbitrary function of @xmath8 . within this algebra",
    "we verify that the generators satisfy the jacobi identity with    @xmath9    being the casimir operator of the algebra .",
    "assuming that there is a vacuum state represented by @xmath10 , it can be demonstrated @xcite that for an arbitrary function @xmath11 , that    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the lowest @xmath8 eigenvalue and @xmath15 is the @xmath16th iteration through function @xmath17 .",
    "this gha describes a class of one - dimensional quantum systems characterized by energy eigenvalues given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are successive energy levels . unlike standard heisenberg algebra ( where the energy of the @xmath21-th level is equal to @xmath21 times the energy of the first one ) , here ,",
    "the energy of the @xmath21-th level ( depending on the value of the parameters ) is greater or smaller than @xmath21 times the energy of the first one . in the last case ,",
    "the energy gap between consecutive levels becomes smaller as n increases , behaving like the energy spectrum of a composite particle .",
    "so we can postulate that this algebra describes a composite particle .",
    "let us discuss , firstly , the algebra given by ( [ eq:1])-([eq:3 ] ) for the quadratic case , i.e. @xmath22 , which is the simplest nonlinear case .",
    "the algebraic relations ( [ eq:1])-([eq:3 ] ) can be written as @xcite    @xmath23_{q } & = & t   \\ , a^\\dagger j^2_0 + s \\ , a^\\dagger ,   \\label{eq:9 } \\\\",
    "\\left [ j_0 , a \\right]_{q^{-1 } } & = & -\\frac{t}{q } \\ , j^2_0 \\ , a - \\frac{s}{q } \\ , a,\\\\ \\label{eq:10 } \\left [ a^\\dagger , a   \\right ] & = & t   \\ , j^2_0 + ( { q}-1 ) \\ , j_0 + s ,   \\label{eq:11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24_q= a \\ , b - q \\ , b \\ , a$ ] , is the @xmath1-deformed commutation relation of two operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the relations ( [ eq:9])-([eq:11 ] ) describe a two - parameter deformed heisenberg algebra already studied@xcite .",
    "of course , for @xmath27 we recover the linear case and if additionely @xmath28 , the standard heisenberg algebra .",
    "we focus now on the graphical analysis of the function @xmath29 .",
    "let us plot @xmath30 together with @xmath31 . in the points where lines intersect ,",
    "we have @xmath32 . so the intersections are precisely the fixed points .",
    "( b ) @xmath33 and ( c ) @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . ]    assuming @xmath36 , there are three cases to be analyzed : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath33 and @xmath40 @xmath41 , for @xmath42 ( see fig 1 ) . however , as depicted in ( fig .",
    "1 ) , depending on @xmath43 and @xmath14 , we have different spectra .",
    "nevertheless , we are interested in a special spectrum which can be associated to a composite particle , thus , only the case @xmath40 for @xmath44 is relevant .",
    "fig 2 shows the comparison between the quadratic and the linear cases .",
    "as one may notice , in the linear case , there is a simple relation among energy level gaps ( as @xmath21 increases , the energy gap between sucessive levels always decreases ) wich make the linear case unsuitable to fit some realistic spectra , see for instance@xcite .",
    "this makes the quadratic more suitable to fit the spectra of the mainstream composite particle .",
    "now , we will realize the operators @xmath4 , @xmath45 and @xmath8 in terms of physical operators , as in the case of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator . and",
    "@xmath45 can be written as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath1 . ] in order to do so we will employ the formalism of non - commutative differential and integral calculus @xcite which considers a one - dimensional lattice in a momentum space where the momenta are allowed to take only discrete values @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and so on , with @xmath50 .",
    "let us introduce the momentum shift operator    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the left and right discrete derivatives that shift the momentum value by @xmath25 , i.e.    @xmath54    and satisfy    @xmath55    introducing the momentum operator @xmath56    @xmath57    hence    @xmath58    now , we return to the realization , observing that , in this case we have not an explicit formula for @xmath15 as in the linear one @xcite , but we can still associate this two - parameter deformed heisenberg algebra ( [ eq:9])-([eq:11 ] ) to the one - dimensional lattice we have just presented . by defining an operator @xmath59 such that    @xmath60    we can write an operator @xmath61 that verifyes    @xmath62    so , using ( [ eq:5])-([eq:7 ] ) we can write @xmath8 as    @xmath63    where we heve defined @xmath64 , with p given by ( [ eq:17 ] ) .",
    "this implies that    @xmath65    moreover , it is easy to see @xcite that    @xmath66    with @xmath67 and @xmath68 defined in eqs.([eq:14])-([eq:15 ] ) .    now , using eqs.([eq:5])-([eq:7 ] ) , we finally define    @xmath69    where @xmath70 being @xmath14 the lowest @xmath8 eigenvalue . following similar steps to those used to construct a standard spin-@xmath71 qft @xcite , let us define two operators @xmath72 satisfying    @xmath73 & = & -\\imath \\ , a \\ , q     \\label{eq:30 } \\\\ \\left [ p , q \\right ] & = & \\imath \\ , a \\ , \\chi    \\label{eq:31 } \\\\ \\left [ \\chi , q \\right ] & = & 2 \\ , \\imath ( s^2(p)-s^2(p+a ) ) .",
    "\\label{eq:32}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at this point , we introduce an independent copy of the one - dimensional momentum lattice , we have just defined , at each point of a @xmath74-lattice through the substitution @xmath75 so ,    @xmath76    then , we define three field operators    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath16 is a real number . using ( [ eq:33])-([eq:35 ] )",
    "we can show that the hamiltonian @xmath79 can be written as    @xmath80 \\label{eq:37}\\ ] ]    where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is given by eq.([eq:27 ] ) . note that in the limit @xmath83 , we recover the linear case and for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , the hamiltonian is proportional to the number operator .",
    "the time evolution of the fields can be studied by solving heisenberg s equation for @xmath85 .",
    "so , using eq .",
    "( [ eq:37 ] ) we have    @xmath86 = w(\\vec{k } ) \\ , a_{\\vec{k}}^{\\dagger } \\ , h(n_{\\vec{k } } ) \\label{eq:38}\\ ] ]    where for the quadratic case    @xmath87 , \\label{eq:39}\\ ] ]    with @xmath88 and @xmath89 . for the general case @xmath90",
    ", we have @xmath91+(u+1)\\ ] ] with    @xmath92    solving the heisenberg equation    @xmath93    we can write eq.([eq:33 ] ) as @xmath94 , ] where @xmath95    the feynman propagator @xmath96 defined as dyson - wick contraction between ( @xmath97 ) @xmath98 and @xmath99 can be computed using ( [ eq:41 ] ) . in the integral representation",
    "it is given by @xmath100 note that , if @xmath101 the standard result is recovered .",
    "we shall now analyze the scattering process @xmath102 for @xmath103 with initial state    @xmath104    and final state @xmath105 where these particles are described by the hamiltonian given in eq.([eq:37 ] ) with an interaction @xmath106 .",
    "for the first order scattering process we have @xmath107 and for the second order    @xmath108    @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111    where ,    @xmath112    with @xmath113 , and    @xmath114    being    @xmath115    so , up to second order we have @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the same contributions that one can find in the structureless particle standard @xmath119-@xmath120 theory model corresponding to the @xmath121 and @xmath122 channels for one - loop level respectively .",
    "3 compares the deformed cross section , for the linear and quadratic cases , with the standard one@xcite .",
    "as one can see , the linear case always gives a deformed - cross section smaller than the standard one for @xmath123 and greater for @xmath124 ( for @xmath125 ) .",
    "therefore , it becomes difficult to fit both energy espectrum of the composite particle and cross section , inasmuch as we may have an ambiguous situation where we need @xmath124 to fit the energy spectrum and @xmath126 for the cross section .",
    "however , in the quadratic case we do not have such ambiguity ( as depicted in fig .",
    "3 ) because we have one more parameter .",
    "we showed that within the framework of deformed heisenberg algebra , with a quadratic characteristic function , it is possible to construct a generalized quantum field theory ( gqft ) that describes a composite particle .",
    "comparison between a gqft made with a linear@xcite and quadratic characteristic function was performed showing that , the latter , is more suitable to fit experimental data .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that a gqft made with a general characteristic function brings wider possibilities than the quadratic one but several restrictions must be imposed to the parameters , @xmath127 , in order to describe a composite particle .",
    "these restrictions are already present in the quadratic case but the algebra is much more simple for this case .",
    "one can show that the general case can be obtained replacing @xmath128+(u+1)$ ] . in future works",
    "we will address this formalism to analize compton scattering by nuclei below pion threshold where no quantitative consistent description exists based on first principles@xcite .",
