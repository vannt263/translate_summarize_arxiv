    "extensive studies over the past twenty or so years on strange nonchaotic attractors @xcite have helped to establish that such behavior is not exceptional @xcite . by",
    "now several examples are known where it may be clearly shown that the dynamics is both strange and nonchaotic @xcite , namely that the attractor has a fractal geometry , and that the largest lyapunov exponent is either zero or negative .",
    "a number of questions relating to the origins of such dynamics remain open .",
    "most studies ( analytical or numerical ) of sna dynamics have been on low ",
    "dimensional quasiperiodically driven systems .",
    "one open question relates to the need for external forcing .",
    "all known examples of systems where snas occur have a skew  product structure , and it is still not entirely clear whether this feature is necessary or merely sufficient .",
    "further , in all known examples the external drive is quasiperiodic in time : it is also not clear whether this form of drive is necessary for the creation of strange nonchaotic motion or merely sufficient @xcite .    for chaotic attractors ,",
    "there can in principle be several positive lyapunov exponents ( the phenomenon of hyperchaos ) .",
    "although the snas are geometrically similar to chaotic attractors , any further analogy between them is clearly not possible , and thus it is of interest to investigate the nature of snas in high  dimensional dynamical systems .    in the present work we consider model time  delay quasiperiodically driven dynamical systems and study the nature of the dynamics .",
    "the inclusion of time  delay through a diffusive self - feedback coupling term makes the system effectively infinite  dimensional .",
    "the snas that are created , however , continue to be low ",
    "dimensional @xcite and are very similar to those created in the absence of time  delay seen in earlier studies @xcite .",
    "a second motivation for the present study is practical . in order to create snas in an experiment , the physical set ",
    "up may involve time ",
    "delays and thus it is important to know the effects of including such coupling . time",
    "delay coupling has attracted considerable interest since this can cause interesting dynamical phenomena such as amplitude death @xcite or novel bifurcations @xcite .",
    "since all lyapunov exponents on snas are nonpositive , a distinctive property of such attractors is that trajectories with different initial conditions do not separate from each other .",
    "indeed , on two identical but separate systems , trajectories started with the same phase will completely synchronize with each other @xcite .",
    "if the initial phases are different , then trajectories show phase ",
    "synchronization @xcite .",
    "similarly , on a given sna , trajectories starting from different initial conditions also coincide or phase  synchronize in this manner , which is one of our aim in this paper .    in the next section of this paper we study the occurrence of snas in time  delay driven dynamical systems .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of phase synchronization in section iii .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in section iv .",
    "we study two model quasiperiodically modulated systems . among the earliest demonstrations of dynamical systems with sna",
    "was the driven and damped pendulum equation @xcite used to model a driven squid with inertia and damping .",
    "we introduce a delay feedback term , to get the equation of motion as @xmath1 .",
    "\\label{eq : squid}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the drive is made quasiperiodic by requiring the ratio of the frequencies to be an irrational number .",
    "here we take this ratio as inverse golden mean , @xmath2 .    in a similar manner",
    ", we also consider a driven rssler system @xcite with delay feedback and quasiperiodic parameter modulation , @xmath3\\\\   { \\dot { z}}&=&0.1+z ( x-14 ) .",
    "\\label{eq : ross}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above dynamical systems are integrated using standard techniques @xcite and we compute the largest several lyapunov exponents @xcite as a function of parameters . for a wide range of parameter values , we find that the dynamics is on nonchaotic attractors in both systems , and representative results are shown in fig . 1 .    the largest lyapunov exponent is shown in figs . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) for the squid and rssler systems respectively .",
    "( see the caption for details of the parameter values ) .",
    "the symbols @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote quasiperiodic torus and chaotic attractors respectively , and @xmath6 indicates the amplitude  death region , where oscillations die to a fixed point @xcite .",
    "the corresponding variance of finite  time lyapunov exponents , which has been used as an order parameter for detecting the torus to sna transition ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , is shown in figs . 1 ( c ) and ( d ) and this suggests the presence of snas in the region marked by arrows .",
    "examples of such nonchaotic attractors are shown in figs .",
    "1 ( g , h ) for the two cases .",
    "the route to snas appears to be via fractalization @xcite ( see figs . 1 ( e , f ) ) ; in this transition , a torus attractor gets wrinkled progressively as parameters are increased and transform to snas @xcite with a slow increase in the variance of finite  time lyapunov exponents as shown in fig . 1 ( c , d ) .    a number of measures @xcite have been suggested in order to quantitatively confirm that the attractors are indeed snas .",
    "we compute the partial fourier sum @xcite , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is proportional to the irrational driving frequency @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 is the time series of one of the dynamical variables . the graph of re @xmath4 vs. i m @xmath4 gives a `` walk '' on the plane , with mean square displacement@xmath11 .",

    "since the largest lyapunov exponent is negative , trajectories on snas have the property that they eventually coincide and become identical ( typically with a time  shift ) .",

    "consider now two identical systems where the dynamics is on snas .",
    "trajectories starting from arbitrary initial conditions will therefore show synchronization .",
    "if the initial phases are the same , the synchronization will be complete @xcite , but more generally , this will be a phase  synchronization @xcite . since this phenomenon occurs in the absence of any coupling between the two systems , this notion of synchronization also applies to two trajectories in the same system .",
