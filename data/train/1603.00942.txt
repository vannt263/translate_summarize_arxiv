    "thus , if there are more absorbed magnons than emitted ones ( @xmath96 according to eq . ) , the number of spin - down electrons would be larger than that of spin - up electrons , and chemical potential of spin - up and spin - down electrons would no longer be the same and @xmath97 .",

    "although the thermal gradient in nm ( @xmath275 k / m ) is four orders of magnitude larger than that in fi ( @xmath276 k / m ) , the spin current due to @xmath92 ( up - triangles ) is negligibly smaller than that due to @xmath93 ( squares ) , showing ineffective generation of spin current by the thermal gradient in nm .",

    "interestingly , the spin current generated by a thermal gradient in fi increase almost linearly with the temperature while the spin current under a fixed interfacial temperature difference saturates at a higher enough temperature .",
    "the experimentally measured ishe voltage @xmath283 in open - circuit comes from ishe - induced charge accumulation . according to above results ,",
    "when @xmath6 , spins along the @xmath16-direction move to the @xmath284-direction .",
    "due to the ishe , a charge current flows along the @xmath285-direction ( electrons flow to the @xmath286-direction ) , resulting in a charge accumulation in the front / back surfaces ( @xmath287-planes in fig . [ system ] ) and a higher electric potential in the @xmath285 side than that in the @xmath286 side as what was observed in experiment @xcite . reversing the direction of either the magnetization of fi or the temperature gradient , the ishe voltage @xmath283 changes sign .",

    "the agreement is not too bad since a real system is much more complicated than the ideal model conserded here . in reality , the thermal parameters and relaxation times depend on temperature and the structure of a sample .",
    "if these complications can be included , our theory may give a more accurate estimate of the ishe voltage for a sample .",
    "in our analysis , we assume the simplest parabolic energy spectrum and constant relaxation times for magnons and electrons .",
    "though the physics shall not change , the value of all quantities should be sensitive to all these parameters .",
    "the interface electron - magnon scattering should be important for other phenomena in fi / nm structures such as spin pumping @xcite , transverse sse @xcite , spin transfer torque on fi @xcite and spin hall magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "it may also be relevant to the concept of  spin mixing conductance \" .",
    "it is shown that no spin injection and no spin accumulation are possible at the thermal equilibrium .",
    "this conclusion is general and model - independent as demanded by the thermodynamical laws .",
    "spin current and spin accumulation can be generated through electron - magnon scatterings by two thermal sources : temperature gradients in fi layers and a temperature difference at nm / fi interface .",
    "both spin current and spin accumulation are sensitive to material properties . the spin accumulation increases and the spin current decreases as the spin diffusion length of nm increases . the spin current arises from imbalance of magnon absorption and emission originated from different magnon and electron temperatures or the deviations of magnons from their equilibrium distributions .",
    "spin current flows from the hotter side to the colder one under a temperature gradient in fi or under an interfacial temperature difference , consistent with existing experiments .",

    "<S> spin current injection and spin accumulation near a ferromagnetic insulator ( fi)/nonmagnetic metal ( nm ) bilayer film under a thermal gradient is investigated theoretically . using the fermi golden rule and the boltzmann equations , we find that fi and nm can exchange spins via interfacial electron - magnon scattering because of the imbalance between magnon emission and absorption caused by either non - equilibrium distribution of magnons or non - equilibrium between magnons and electrons . a temperature gradient in fi and/or a temperature difference across the fi / nm interface generates a spin current which carries angular momenta parallel to the magnetization of fi from the hotter side to the colder one . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the spin current induced by a temperature gradient in nm is negligibly small due to the nonmagnetic nature of the non - equilibrium electron distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the results agree well with all existing experiments . </S>"
