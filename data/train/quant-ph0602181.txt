    "since berry s discovery @xcite that a state of a quantum system can acquire a phase of purely geometric origin when the hamiltonian of the system undergoes a cyclic and adiabatic change , there have been numerous proposals for generalizations , including the geometric phase for nonadiabatic , noncyclic , and nonunitary evolution @xcite , the geometric phase for mixed states @xcite , the geometric phase in systems with quantum field driving and vacuum induced effects @xcite , as well as the geometric phase in coupled bipartite systems@xcite .",
    "recently , the attention has turned to studying geometric phase in open systems , this is motivated by the fact that all realistic system are coupled , at least weakly , to their environment . from the perspective of application , the use of geometric phases in the implementation of fault - tolerant quantum gates @xcite requires the study of geometric phases in more realistic systems .",
    "for instance , the system which carries information may decoher from a quantum superposition into statistical mixtures , and this effect , called decoherence , is the most important limiting factor for quantum computing .",
    "the study of geometric phase in open systems may be traced back to 1980s , when garrison and wright @xcite first touched on this issue by describing open system evolution in terms of non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "this is a pure state analysis , so it did not address the problem of geometric phases for mixed states . toward the geometric phase for mixed states in open systems , the approaches used include solving the master equation of the system @xcite , employing a quantum trajectory analysis @xcite or krauss operators",
    "@xcite , and the perturbative expansions @xcite . some interesting results were achieved that may be briefly summarized as follows : nonhermitian hamiltonian lead to a modification of berry s phase @xcite , stochastically evolving magnetic fields produce both energy shift and broadening @xcite , phenomenological weakly dissipative liouvillians alter berry s phase by introducing an imaginary correction @xcite or lead to damping and mixing of the density matrix elements @xcite .",
    "however , almost all these studies are performed for dissipative systems under various approximations , thus the representations are approximately applicable for systems whose energy is not conserved .",
    "quantum trajectory analysis @xcite that uses the quantum jump approach is available for open systems with conserved energy .",
    "its starting point , however , is the master equation , a result within the quantum markov approximation and in the weak coupling limit . beyond the quantum markov approximation and the weak coupling limit ,",
    "the geometric phase of a two - level system _ with quantum field driving _ was analyzed @xcite , where the whole system ( the two - level system plus the quantum field ) was assumed subject to dephasing , the subsystem(two - level system in that paper ) may still acquire geometric phase even when the whole system in its pointer states .",
    "this is an ideal situation to show the vacuum effects on the geometric phase of the subsystem , as well as the decoherence effects on the geometric phases regardless of its feasibility of experimental realization .",
    "however , beyond the markov approximation and the weak coupling limit , the geometric phase for a dissipative system remains untouched . in this paper",
    ", we will deal with the geometric phase in open systems , beyond the markov approximation and weak coupling limit .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the exact solution and calculation of the geometric phase of a system dephasingly coupled to its environment is presented , an example to detail the representation and a discussion on physical realization are given in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we present an example to show the calculation of geometric phases in dissipative systems . finally we conclude in sec.v .",
    "in this section , we investigate the behavior of geometric phase of a quantum system subject to decoherence . in order to make a comparison with the results from the quantum jump approach , we consider the quantum system without any field driving except the environment .",
    "so , it is not directly relevant to our previous study@xcite .",
    "the environment that leads to decoherence may originate form the vacuum fluctuations or the background radiations .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to consider the case where the system - environment coupling @xmath0 and the free system hamiltonian @xmath1 commute .",
    "this is the situation of dephasing and the exact analytical dynamics may be obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of a system with such properties may be described by the master equation when the markov approximation and the weak coupling assumption apply , this kind of decoherence would not change the geometric phase of the quantum system by the quantum jump approach@xcite . however , as you will see , this is not the case from the viewpoint of interferometry considered in this paper .",
    "we consider a situation described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath2 where @xmath1 describes the free hamiltonian of the system , @xmath3 stands for the hamiltonian of the environment , and @xmath0 represents the system - environment couplings . the environment and the system hamiltonian may be taken arbitrary but with constraints @xmath4=0 $ ] .",
    "let us suppose that the interaction hamiltonian @xmath0 has the form ( setting @xmath5 ) @xmath6 where the @xmath7 are the system operators satisfying @xmath8=0,$ ] and the @xmath9 represent environment operators that may take any form in general .",
    "commutation relation @xmath8=0 $ ] enables us to write the time evolution operator for the whole systems(system+environment ) as @xmath10 with @xmath11 , a function of environment operators satisfying @xmath12 here , @xmath13 stands for the eigenstate of @xmath1 with eigenvalue @xmath14@xcite , while @xmath15 denotes the eigenvalue of @xmath16 corresponding to eigenstate @xmath13 . for a specific @xmath17",
    ", @xmath11 may be expressed in a factorized form , which will be shown later through the spin - boson model .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the environment and the system are initially independent , such that the total density operator factorizes into a direct product , @xmath18 at time @xmath19 , the reduced density operator of the system is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22.$ ] eq.([dmst ] ) shows that the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath23 are time - independent , while the off - diagonal elements evolve with time involving contributions from the environment - system couplings , it at most cases would lead to decaying in the off - diagonal elements , and eventually results in vanishing of these matrix elements .",
    "now we turn to study the geometric phase of the open system . for open systems ,",
    "the states in general are not pure and the evolution of the system is not unitary . for non - unitary evolutions ,",
    "the geometric phase can be calculated as follows .",
    "first , solve the eigenvalue problem for the reduced density matrix @xmath24 and obtain its eigenvalues @xmath25 as well as the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath26 secondly , substitute @xmath25 and @xmath27 into    @xmath28    here , @xmath29 is the geometric phase for the system undergoing non - unitary evolution @xcite , @xmath30 denotes a time after that the system completes a cyclic evolution when it is isolated from any environments . taking the effect of environment into account ,",
    "the system no longer undergoes a cyclic evolution , but we still keep the @xmath30 as the period for calculating the geometric phase in this paper . the geometric phase eq .",
    "( [ gp5 ] ) is gauge invariant and can be reduced to the well - known results in the unitary evolution , thus it is experimentally testable . the geometric phase factor defined by eq.([gp5 ] ) may be understood as a weighted sum over the phase factors pertaining to the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix , thus the detail of analytical expression for the geometric phase would depend on the digitalization of the reduced density matrix eq.([dmst ] ) .",
    "to be specific , we now present a detailed model to illustrate the idea in sec .",
    "the system under consideration consists of a two - level system coupling to its environment with coupling constants @xmath31 , the hamiltonian which governs the evolution of such a system may be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the creation and annihilation operators of the environment bosons , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 denote the excited and ground states of the two - level system with rabi frequency @xmath37 .",
    "this hamiltonian corresponds to @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the general model eq.([gm ] ) . generally speaking",
    ", the choice of the coupling between the system and the environment determines the effect of the environment .",
    "for example , the choice of the system operator @xmath40 that do not change the good quantum number of @xmath1 when they operate on the eigenstates of @xmath1 would result in dephasing of the system , but not energy relaxations .",
    "the system - environment coupling taken in this section is exactly of this kind .    by the procedure presented above",
    ", the reduced density matrix in basis @xmath41 for the open system follows @xcite , @xmath42 where an initial state of @xmath43 for the total system was assumed in the calculation , and @xmath44 with @xmath45 , and @xmath46 denoting the vacuum state of the environment .",
    "some remarks on the reduced density matrix are now in order . for any @xmath47 , @xmath48 , so as @xmath19 tends to infinity ( with respect to the system s coherence time ) , @xmath49 tends to zero , this indicates that the off - diagonal elements would vanish on a long time scale with respect to the decoherence time , and hence the open system would not acquire geometric phase when time is longer than the decoherence time .",
    "this is different form the results concluded in the previous work , where the subsystem may acquire geometric phase even for the whole system in its pointer states @xcite . to calculate the geometric phase pertaining to eq.([ha2 ] ) , we first write down the eigenstate and its corresponding eigenvalue for the reduced density matrix @xmath50 as , @xmath51 with @xmath52 clearly , for a closed system , namely @xmath53 , @xmath54 , the eigenvalue and corresponding eigenstates reduce to @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 all these together yield the well - known geometric phase @xmath60 eq.([ev ] ) and eq.([ef ] ) are the exact results for the open two - level system , the geometric phase would depend on how @xmath49 varies with time . for a continuous spectrum of environmental modes with constant spectral density @xmath61 @xmath62 with @xmath63 where @xmath64 was assumed . up to the first order in @xmath65 , the geometric phase at time @xmath66",
    "is given by @xmath67 this result can be easily understood as follows .",
    "the geometric phase factor for mixed states is defined as a weighted sum over the phase factors pertaining to the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix , the dephasing that leads to decaying in the off - diagonal elements would change the phase factors acquired by each eigenstate of the reduced density matrix , thus it modifies the geometric phase .",
    "this is different from the definition in the quantum jump approach @xcite , in which the problem of defining berry s phase for mixed states was avoided by approaching the dynamics of open system from a sequence of pure states , this leads to the result that the geometric phase is unaffected by dephasing , but it lowers the observed visibility in any interference measurements . from the aspect of mixed state , the evolution of the system is among several trajectories with corresponding probabilities , so the geometric phase is defined as a weighted sum over the trajectories that the system undergoes .",
    "now we are in a position to discuss the geometric phase acquired at time @xmath66 by the two - level system . substituting eqs([ev ] ) and ( [ ef ] ) in to eq.([gp5 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath68 it is worthy to notice that eq.([bpf ] ) is the geometric phase beyond the quantum markov approximation and the weak coupling limit . in this sense",
    "it provides us more insight into the geometric phase for dephasing system .",
    "the numerical results for eq .",
    "( [ bpf ] ) are presented in figure 1 , where the dependence of the geometric phase is illustrated as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath69 and the damping rate @xmath65 .",
    "the spectrum of environmental modes was taken to be @xmath70 in this plot .",
    "clearly , the two - level system acquires zero geometric phase with @xmath65 tends to infinity , this indicates that the two - level system acquires no geometric phase after the decoherence time .",
    "the representation in this paper may be used to analyze and estimate the error in the holonomic quantum computation due to decoherence @xcite , in which the key error occurs within the degenerate subspace .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes such a system reads @xmath71 , where the degenerate energy was assumed to be zero , @xmath72 denote the degenerate levels coupled to the environment with coupling constants @xmath73 .",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath74 , with an appropriate choice of @xmath75 .",
    "this exactly is the case discussed in sections ii and iii .",
    "the open system effect in geometric phase may be observed with a combination of the engineering reservoir technique @xcite and the mach - zehnder atom interferometer @xcite , in which each of the arms consists of an atom in a dark state .",
    "the dark state can be realized in the atom - light system that consists of cesium atoms interacting with light resonant with the @xmath76 transitions of the @xmath77 line .",
    "it makes the dynamical phase negligible with respect to the geometric phase .",
    "a dephasing engineering reservoir in one arm of the interferometer , which may be simulated by variations of the light fields , would give a relative phase to the atom passing though the arm , the output interference pattern yields the geometric phase of the atom system .",
    "one of the key assumptions of our representation is the dephasing condition , i.e. , @xmath78=0 $ ] .",
    "using ground states as the qubits can make the formulation exact .",
    "suppose now there is an small additional term in @xmath0 , @xmath79 , that breaks the dephasing condition .",
    "simple algebra shows that the transition probability between @xmath13 and @xmath80 due to coupling @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 denotes the maximum of average values of @xmath84 . in the case of @xmath85 ,",
    "the open system may be treated as a dephasing system , because the transition between any different eigenstates of the system may be ignored .",
    "the case where this transition could not be ignored will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section , we will consider a spin-@xmath86 particle interacting with an environment formed by @xmath87 independent spins through the hamiltonian @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 denote pauli operators for the environment and spin-@xmath86 particle , respectively .",
    "@xmath92 are coupling constants , term with @xmath93 stands for the self - hamiltonian of the particle .",
    "this model is interesting because the pointer states do not coincide with the eigenstates of the interaction hamiltonian , but can range from coherent sates to eigenstates of the system s hamiltonian determining by the interplay between the self - hamiltonian and the interaction with the environment .",
    "we will calculate the geometric phase gained by the particle beyond the markov approximation and the weak coupling limit .",
    "the dynamics govern by hamiltonian eq.([hd ] ) can be solved exactly by a standard procedure@xcite , it yields the reduced density matrix of the particle as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the polarization vector given by @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98,\\nonumber\\\\   p_z(t , b ) & = & p_z(0 ) \\frac{b^2+\\delta^2 \\cos ( 2 \\omega_b t)}{\\omega_b^2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & p_x(0 ) \\frac{2 \\delta b } { \\omega_b^2}\\sin^2(\\omega_b t ) + p_y(0 ) \\frac{\\delta}{\\omega_b } \\sin(2 \\omega_b t).\\label{pt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to get this result , it is only required that the couplings @xmath99 of eq.([hd ] ) are sufficiently concentrated near their average value so that their standard deviation exists and is finite .    by rewriting the reduced density matrix @xmath24 in the form",
    "@xmath100 we get the geometric phase@xcite of the particle acquired at time @xmath101 ,    @xmath102    after simple manipulations , we arrive at @xmath103.\\label{bpd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath104",
    "@xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 the dependence of the geometric phase @xmath108 on the variance @xmath109 and system free energy @xmath93 is complicated , we discuss here on two limiting cases @xmath110 and @xmath111 with a specific initial state @xmath112 . in @xmath113 limit , the dynamics of the spin-@xmath86 particle is so slow that its behavior should approach @xmath114 and @xmath115 which yields @xmath116 because @xmath117 in this limit with the initial state . in @xmath118 limit , eq.([pt ] ) follows that , @xmath119 , \\nonumber\\\\ p_y(t)&=&p_z(t)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 @xmath121 is the error function , and @xmath122 in this limit . by eq.([bpd ] ) , it is clear that @xmath116 in this limit , too .",
    "the numerical result for the geometric phase as a function of @xmath93 and @xmath109 was shown in figure 2 . to plot this figure",
    ", we assume that the system has evolved for time @xmath123 , which is the characterized time for the system undergoing a free evolution .",
    "figure 2 shows that the geometric phase is zero in the two limiting cases @xmath124 and @xmath125 as expected .",
    "there are sharp changes among the line @xmath126 , indicating a crossover from the limit @xmath125 to @xmath127",
    "we have presented a general calculation the geometric phase in open systems subject to dephasing and dissipation , the calculations are beyond the quantum markov approximation and the weak coupling limit . for the dephasing system",
    ", it acquires no geometric phase with the decoherence rate @xmath128 , this can be explained as an effect of decoherence on the geometric phase , i.e. , the quantum system could not maintain its phase information after the decoherence time .",
    "there is a sharp change along the line @xmath129 as figure 1 shown , this can be understood in terms of the bloch sphere that represents the state of the system .",
    "the geometric phase increases due to decoherence when initial states fall onto the upper semi - sphere , but it decrease when the initial states on the lower semi - sphere .",
    "these results are similar to the prediction given by the quantum trajectory analysis for dissipative systems .",
    "the geometric phase @xmath108 in dissipative systems is always zero as long as @xmath130constant , this is exactly the case when @xmath131 or @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath131 implies that the self energy @xmath93 of the particle is much larger than the cumulative variance @xmath109 of the coupling constants @xmath99 . for @xmath99",
    "taking the value @xmath133 or @xmath134 ( @xmath135 arbitrary ) with equal probability , @xmath136 this tells us that the geometric phase is zero when the self - hamiltonian dominates . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath132 the interaction hamiltonian dominates , pointer states in this situation coincide with the eigenstates of the interaction hamiltonian , thus the spin-@xmath86 particle could not acquire geometric phase . in the crossover regime @xmath137 , the geometric phase change sharply due to the interplay between the self - hamiltonian and the interaction with the environment .",
    "these results constitute the basis of a framework to analyze errors in the holonomic quantum computation , where two kinds of errors are believed to affect its performance .",
    "this first error would take the system out of the degenerate computation subspace , while the second takes place within the subspace .",
    "the first kind of error can be eliminated by working in the ground states and having a system where the energy gap with the first excited state is very large .",
    "the second kind of error falls to the regime analyzed in sec .",
    "ii and iii , since there is no dissipation but dephasing in the system , while the first belongs to the regime discussed in sec .",
    "the calculation presented here in principle allows one to study the geometric phase at any timescale , and hence it has advantages with respect to any treatment with approximations in most literatures .",
