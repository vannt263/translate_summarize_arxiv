    "in the last ten years , starting with the pioneer paper by minahan and zarembo @xcite , a vast integrable structure has been unveiled in the @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory @xcite .",
    "there are hopes that together with the spectrum of states , the integrability can be used to compute the correlation functions of the theory .",
    "of special interest are the correlation functions of one - trace operators in the classical limit when the length of the traces is very large .",
    "such operators are dual to extended classical strings in the ads@xmath2s@xmath3 background , and knowing their correlation functions can shed light about the interactions at strong coupling .    recently , escobedo , gromov , sever and vieira @xcite developed bethe - ansatz techniques for computing the tree - level structure coefficient @xmath4 and found an expression for the latter in terms of scalar products of bethe states for the xxx@xmath5 spin chain . in @xcite",
    "an elegant analytic formula was derived for the classical limit of the structure coefficient of when one of the operators is protected ( bps ) . in this note",
    "we generalize the result of @xcite to the case of three non - bps classical operators",
    ". our starting point will be the representation of the structure constant in terms of slavnov - like determinants @xcite , proposed recently by foda @xcite .",
    "in a @xmath1 sector of the sym theory , the operators are made of two complex scalars @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we consider the correlation function of three single - trace operators of the type @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath10 $ ] , @xmath11 $ ] , where the omitted terms are weighted products of the same constituents taken in different order .",
    "the weights are chosen so that the operator @xmath12 is an eigenstates of the dilatation operator with dimensions @xmath13 . at tree level ,",
    "the structure coefficient is a sum over all possible ways to perform the wick contractions between the scalars and their conjugates .",
    "a non - zero result is obtained only if @xmath14 and the number of contractions @xmath15 between operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "this problem is solved using the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite . in the bethe - ansatz approach , the operator @xmath16 is represented by a @xmath21-magnon bethe eigenstate with energy @xmath22 of the xxx@xmath5 spin chain of length @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . to simplify the presentation we consider only highest - weight states , but",
    "our method is valid in general .",
    "such a state is completely characterized by the rapidities of the magnons @xmath25 and will be denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "it is advantageous first to deform the problem by introducing impurities @xmath27 at the sites of the @xmath28-th spin chain @xmath29 , and take the homogeneous limit @xmath30 at the very end .",
    "we denote the impurities associated with the contractions between the operators @xmath31 and @xmath12 by @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 , etc",
