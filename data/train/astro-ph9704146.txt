    "this contribution would augment that of quasars , especially at high redshift where their number density is observed to decline .",
    "the contribution of quasars itself depends on how our picture of their evolution is distorted by dust obscuration ( fall & pei 1993 ) .    direct observations of the lyman continuum ( ly@xmath1 ) radiation escaping from galaxies is however extremely difficult and , so far , only upper limits have been obtained with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) in four nearby star - forming galaxies ( leitherer et al .",

    "any quantitative assessment of the contribution of galaxies to the ionizing background would therefore require a large number of observations before a ly@xmath1 luminosity function is established .",
    "this uncertainty on the ly@xmath1 escape fraction is also a severe limitation for model predictions even though some of them are reasonably successful in linking the ly@xmath1 radiation produced by star formation to the rate of chemical enrichment in the universe ( cowie 1988 , songaila et al .",

    "the calculation of the first normalization constant accounts for the detection limit of 0.24    rest equivalent width and a velocity width of 30 km s@xmath35 as in miralda - escud & ostriker ( 1990 ) .",
    "the parameters for the lyman @xmath0 forest clouds have been obtained for @xmath54 but the plot of their evolution up to @xmath55 ( boksenberg 1995 ) shows that our parameterization remains appropriate till the adopted limit at @xmath31 . as a numerical example , we find a transmission from @xmath2 to @xmath31 @xmath56 . playing with the error bars given on the line densities per unit redshift and the evolution parameters ( boksenberg 1995 )",
    "we find that this transmission does not change by more than 40% .",
    "the background radiation calculated by equation ( 4 ) with the average transmission models discussed above is displayed in figure 1 as a function of the ly@xmath1 escape fraction .",
    "although our evaluation is based on the measured ly@xmath1 photons density in the local universe and avoids therefore most of the uncertainties inherent to pure model calculations , it still depends on a few parameters , the index @xmath0 of the average spectral shape in the lyman continuum , the evolution factor and the opacity of the intergalactic medium .",
    "the resulting uncertainties are illustrated in fig .",
    "first , the impact of the ill - known index @xmath0 ( values @xmath57 are used in fig .",
    "1 ) , is found to be reduced by the relation between @xmath0 and the luminosity density at the lyman edge for a given ly@xmath1 photon density .",
    "second , the effect of a larger intergalactic opacity as obtained with the upper limits given by boksenberg ( 1995 ) on the density of lyman clouds and lyman limit systems per unit redshift is modest and comparable with a change of one unit of the index @xmath0 . in contrast , the calculation is sensitive to the amount of evolution as shown with the case of a milder evolution @xmath58 ( till @xmath31 ) plotted in fig .",
    "selected as the variable against which the diffuse radiation has been plotted in fig .",
    "1 , the ly@xmath1 escape fraction is , as anticipated , the major source of uncertainty .",
    "we note , however , that the diffuse radiation does not decrease as fast as the ly@xmath1 escape fraction .",
    "the main reason is that galaxies at high redshift contribute to the diffuse radiation and may still be optically thin at @xmath59   while their nearby counterparts are optically thick at 912   .",
    "the issue of the uncertainty on the luminosity density itself at the lyman edge will be addressed in the two following sections .",
    "we have compared the predictions of figure 1 with the measurements of the ionizing background ( at @xmath60 ) at the lyman edge .",
    "these measurements are only indirect and include the contribution of all ionizing sources , chief among them the quasars .",
    "they are therefore upper limits , possibly very generous , to the contribution of galaxies .",
    "the measurements have been obtained so far through a variety of methods ( bechtold 1993 , for a review ) , such as the h@xmath0 emission from 21-cm emitting clouds , the modeling of the sharp edges of hi clouds and , the proximity effect ( kulkarni & fall 1993 ) , following the observations of the lyman @xmath0 forest at low redshift with the hst . from the recent works of dove & shull ( 1994 ) ,",
    "vogel et al . ( 1995 ) and donahue et al . ( 1995 ) and review of previous determinations therein , we conclude that the ionizing background at 900   should lie in the range @xmath61  . at its lower",
    "bound the ionizing background is comparable to the evaluations currently made for the contribution of quasars ( e.g. madau 1992 ) , indicating a possible negligible role of the galaxies .    fig .",
    "1 shows that , under most of the conditions , the ly@xmath1 escape fraction is smaller than 1% .",
    "this is smaller than the upper limits in the four star - forming galaxies observed by leitherer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , especially after the modifications advocated by hurwitz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) on the basis of unaccounted absorption by hi gas in our galaxy .",
    "our upper limit would be less restrictive than 1% if the spectral index @xmath0 is lower than @xmath62 , or the evolution milder ( @xmath63 ) than found by lilly et al .",
    "insofar as our comparison was made with the intergalactic radiation field of all origin , our upper limit is probably generous but , even if small , does not exclude that galaxies make most of the ionizing intergalactic radiation field .",
    "our conclusion also depends crucially on the value of the total h@xmath0 luminosity density of the local universe in the sense that the larger the h@xmath0 luminosity density ( or the associated number of ly@xmath1 photons ) , the stronger is the upper limit for the ly@xmath1 escape fraction .",
    "our limit of 1% seems firm for two reasons .",
    "first , the h@xmath0 luminosity function built by gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is based on star - forming galaxies with h@xmath64n[ii ] equivalent widths larger than 10     and therefore should more likely lead to an underestimation of the total h@xmath0 luminosity density .",
    "second , our conversion of the h@xmath0 luminosity density into a ly@xmath1 photon density under case b assumptions provides , as previously said , a lower limit on the latter quantity .",
    "as the h@xmath0 luminosity density of the local universe is a key input in our calculation , we have tried to evaluate how this quantity and the associated number of ly@xmath1 photons compare with other measured quantities tracing the star formation activity in the universe such as the far - uv luminosity density as determined from surveys of galaxies or the far - uv ( non ionizing ) background as measured by in - orbit experiments .",
    "the former quantity is related to the luminosity density emitted at 900    by star formation activity through two parameters , the lyman break of a pure star - forming population and the extinction at far - uv wavelengths due to dust mixed with the young stars in each galaxy .",
    "the far - uv spectral energy distribution ( from longward of the lyman break to @xmath65 2000   ) of a pure ( without dust ) and continuous star - forming population can be assumed to be flat in energy per frequency unit as shown by the models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) and the observations of star - forming galaxies with little extinction by calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in the case of a continuous rate",
    "as we expect for the average star formation in the local universe , the lyman break factor should be of the order of 4 according to bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) and possibly between 6 and 20 depending on the initial mass function for massive stars according to leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) . with an average far - uv extinction of the order of 1 mag as discussed by deharveng et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we get a far - uv ( observed ) to 900    ( emitted ) luminosity density ratio between 1.6 and 8 . for comparison , the 1600    ( observed ) to 900",
    "   ( emitted ) flux ratios in the four galaxies observed by leitherer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are found to be 0.3 , 1.5 , 1.6 and 6 . with the ratio",
    "above and our local luminosity density @xmath32 at the lyman edge of @xmath41  erg  s@xmath35  hz@xmath35",
    "mpc@xmath36 we get a far - uv luminosity density of 2  10 @xmath66  erg  s@xmath35  hz@xmath35  mpc@xmath36 .",
    "this is in agreement with the local luminosity density of 3@xmath67  w  hz@xmath35  mpc@xmath36 ( h@xmath68=50  km  s@xmath35",
    "mpc@xmath35 ) evaluated at 2800    by lilly et al .",

    "( 1997 ) .",
    "although the far - ultraviolet background is rich of several possible components , some of them of galactic origin , various arguments have established the accumulation of galaxy light along the line of sight as the dominant extragalactic contributor ( e.g. bowyer 1991 , jakobsen 1995 , for a review ) with an intensity in the range 50  150 ( or 0.7  2 @xmath3310@xmath69  at say 2000   ) . this background radiation can be converted back into a local luminosity density @xmath70 according to equation ( 2 ) which , with the same assumptions as above but without the neutral gas absorption term and the intergalactic opacity term , writes as @xmath71 the integral upper bound is now 1.2 , the value which shifts the lyman break at 2000   . assuming @xmath43 and @xmath0 in the range @xmath301 to @xmath303 ( the case @xmath72 is observed for galaxies with little extinction and is not appropriate for the average spectral shape ) the upper limit background of 2@xmath3310@xmath69  gives a far - uv luminosity density in the range 2.6  6 @xmath67 w hz@xmath35 mpc@xmath36 , again in satisfying agreement with the range of values that we have derived above .",
    "we have used the h@xmath0 luminosity density of galaxies in the local universe for estimating the contribution of galaxies to the ionizing background at @xmath2 .",
