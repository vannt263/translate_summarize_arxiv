    "in the last decades , the investigation about the transition from quantum to classical dynamics has progressed enormously .",
    "this was induced in part by the development of the experimental techniques , especially in quantum optics @xcite , and in part by the possibility of appearance of technology in quantum information processing @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such research aims to understand how the typically quantum effects disappear in the dynamics of macroscopic systems . according to a popular theoretical model , one believes that the emergence of the classical world from quantum mechanics is a consequence of the unavoidable coupling between the macroscopic system and its environment .",
    "for example , in accordance with this proposal @xcite , environmental coupling is responsible by the rapid evolution of coherent quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable states ( schrdinger cat states ) into statiscal mixtures , a phenomenon known as decoherence .    despite these theoretical advances ,",
    "some aspects of the quantum to classical transition remain subtle and controversial , especially in the case of classically nonlinear or chaotic systems . for some authors ,",
    "the departure of the quantum mean values of observables from the corresponding classical ones ( correspondence breakdown ) in chaotic systems occurs in a very small time scale ( see , for example , @xcite ) and they sustain the idea that the coupling with purely diffusive environment can reduce these discrepancies and increase the break time by decoherence . on the other hand , for other authors ( see @xcite ) decoherence is not necessary to explain the classical behavior of macroscopic systems ( including the chaotic ones ) since the observed discrepancies between quantum and classical mean values of observables are negligible for any current realistic measurement .    in order to shed some light on this debate",
    ", we turn our attention to the one - dimensional nonlinear or anharmonic oscillator ( aho ) coupled to a purely diffusive reservoir .",
    "three are the reasons for the choice of this model .",
    "firstly , in the limit of vanishing environmental coupling , its quantum dynamical evolution exhibits several effects without analogous in its classical counterpart , such as revivals and appearance of coherent superpositions of states @xcite .",
    "secondly , by virtue of its relative simplicity , it is possible to obtain the exact solutions of the equations of motion for quantum @xcite and classical versions of the model even in the presence of the reservoir .",
    "last , but not least , the recent technical advances in trapping and controlling cold atoms suggest the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) as potential candidates to implement experimental tests of this model .",
    "in fact , in the single - mode approximation , a bec trapped in a optical lattice is suitably described by the quantum nonlinear oscillator @xcite .",
    "hence , dissipative aho became a largely studied model in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite , daniel and milburn obtained the exact evolution of the _ q _ function associated to an initial coherent state of an aho subject to attenuation or amplification .",
    "the authors showed that the effects yielded by nonlinearity , such as revivals and squeezing , gradually vanish if a non - unitary mechanism is taken into account .",
    "these results were extended by pe@xmath0inov and luk@xmath1 @xcite to an arbitrary initial state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , kheruntsyan obtained the steady state of wigner function of a single driven damped cavity mode in the presence of a kerr medium .",
    "the author studied a model of reservoir that included two - photon absortion , besides the usual one - photon absorption .",
    "closely related to the present contribution , chaturvedi and srinivasan @xcite found an exact solution of a class of master equations governing the dynamics of a chain of coupled dissipative aho .",
    "the authors used thermofield dynamics notation in order to map a master equation into a schrdinger equation with a non - hermitean hamiltonian .",
    "the form of the general solution of this equation was expressed as an ordered product of exponentials of operators acting on an arbitrary initial condition .    in this contribution",
    ", we obtain the exact time evolutions of the density operator ( section 2 ) and of the classical distribution function ( section 3 ) in the quantum and classical versions of the nonlinear oscillator coupled to a purely diffusive environment .",
    "both results are obtained by the application of the lie algebraic techniques , in particular , the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) formulas used to expand a lie exponential in an ordered product of exponentials @xcite . in the quantum case , the result allows us to find the corresponding wigner function in terms of an expansion in associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "it is important to mention that the wigner function should smoothly approach the corresponding classical distribution in the appropriate limit @xcite .",
    "thus , we take the classical limit of the partial differential equation ( pde ) that governs the time evolution of the wigner function and we obtain a classical fokker - planck ( fp ) equation .",
    "the algebraic structure of the master equation in the quantum case is preserved by the corresponding fp equation in the classical case , so that we can extend the methods applied to obtain the solution of the first in the finding of the solution of the last .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , oliveira and co - workers investigated the diffusive aho and showed that the break times ( _ i.e. _ , the characteristic times of departure of the quantum and classical dynamics ) depend strongly on observable and initial condition . a more  fair \" comparison between the two dynamics shall be given by the evaluation of the distance between the corresponding distributions in the phase space @xcite .",
    "hence , the exact solutions of the equations of motion for the wigner function and classical distribution function will allow to define analytically the break time for the diffusive aho and its dependence in terms of the nonlinearity strength and diffusion constant .",
    "we conclude this work by comparing the quantum and classical evolutions of the wigner and the classical distribution functions for an initial coherent state in the aho with and without diffusion ( section 4 ) .",
    "the results are preliminar and deserve a more careful analysis , but they suggest that , as expected , in quantum case , inclusion of diffusion reduces the phase space interferences and therefore prevent the appearance of quantum coherent superpositions .",
    "the area of the regions where the wigner function should be negative is reduced too . as time goes by",
    ", the wigner distribution gradually takes the form of an annular volume around the origin of the phase space . for later times , this volume becomes more `` fat '' and `` flat '' . in the classical case ,",
    "the fine - structured whorl yielded by the distribution in the diffusionless regime is destroyed .",
    "as it happens in the quantum case , diffusion turns the classical distribution more `` fat '' and `` flat '' around the origin .",
    "these results suggest that the wigner function of the quantum diffusive aho converges gradually to the distribution function of the corresponding classical version of the model in non - unitary evolution .",
    "let us consider the aho coupled to a thermal bath of oscillators in equilibrium at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "assuming that the nonlinearity strength is small and the coupling to the reservoir degrees of freedom is weak , we obtain the following master equation in the interaction picture : @xmath3 +    k\\left(\\bar{n } + 1\\right)\\left[2\\a \\rot{t}\\adag - \\adag\\a \\rot{t }    - \\rot{t}\\adag\\a\\right ] \\notag \\\\    & & + k\\bar{n}\\left[2\\adag \\rot{t}\\a - \\a\\adag \\rot{t }    - \\rot{t}\\a\\adag\\right ] \\notag \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the damping and nonlinearity constants , respectively , and @xmath6 is the average number of thermal photons in the mode @xmath7 of reservoir ( @xmath7 is the natural frequency of the oscillator ) .",
    "the density operator @xmath8 represents the state of the system at time @xmath9 ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the annihilation and creation operators , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the so called diffusive limit of the above equation .",
    "this limit is obtained by taking the damping constant going to zero , @xmath12 , and the number of thermal photons going to infinite , @xmath13 , keeping the product @xmath14 finite .",
    "thus , the master equation ( [ master1 ] ) becomes @xmath15 \\notag \\\\    & & + 2\\kappa\\left[\\a \\rot{t}\\adag + \\adag \\rot{t}\\a - \\adag\\a \\rot{t }    - \\rot{t}\\adag\\a- \\rot{t}\\right ] \\notag \\\\    & = & -ig\\left ( \\mathcal{m}^{2}-\\mathcal{p}^{2}\\right )     \\rot{t }   + 2\\kappa \\left [ \\mathcal{j}+\\mathcal{r}-\\left ( \\mathcal{m}+\\mathcal{p}%    + 1\\right ) \\right ] \\rot{t }    \\notag \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the notation given in ref .",

    "we can determine the quantum state in time @xmath36 , @xmath37 , by expanding the initial state @xmath38 in terms of the eigenfunctions of @xmath35 .",
    "in the same way , the nonlinear hamiltonian term in fokker - planck equation ( [ fpquartic2 ] ) introduces products of differential operators and they also yield an infinite lie algebra",
