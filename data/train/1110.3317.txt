    "human physiology , as a science , aims to understand the mechanical , physical , and biochemical functions of humans ; moreover , because human dynamics transpire both on multiple spatial scales , ranging from molecular ( e.g. , genetics ) , to cell ( e.g. , metabolism ) , to organ ( e.g. , the heart @xcite ) , to collections of organs ( e.g. , the circulatory system ) and on multiple time scales ranging from fractions of a second to decades , it is likely that complete models of human functioning will consist of highly complex models whose scales interact in complex ways ( e.g. , via nonlinear resonance ) @xcite . in this context , _ population physiology _ aims to understand medium to long time scales of human physiology where _ a population of humans _ is required to construct or discover a signal .",
    "moreover , once a signal is constructed the goal is to use this signal understand human dynamics by both understanding the sources of the signals and then stratifying the population into meaningful classes ( e.g. , phenotypes ) according to the different signals .",
    "consequently , population physiology , as we conceive it , has two broad features : data analysis consisting of the construction and analysis of population scale physiological signals , and the mechanistic modeling that can explain and rationalize those signals .",
    "the mathematical modeling of physiological systems on the cellular and organ scales has a long history ( c.f . ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite for a wonderful introduction ) , while the modeling larger scale organ structures is just beginning @xcite .",
    "fundamental to mathematical modeling of physiology is a concrete connection to real data ; as is the case for other basic sciences , mathematical physiological modeling is always tested against physiological data collected in rigorously controlled circumstances . nevertheless , there are at least two elements missing from modern physiological analysis , analysis over large populations , and analysis over long time periods .",
    "the former is important because human beings have diverse reactions to different inputs ( e.g. , drugs , foods , etc ) , and those differences have their roots in physiology .",
    "the later is important because many differences amongst human reactions to input occur on a slow time - scale ; for instance , some smokers develop cancer while others do not . and",
    "again , these differences can have their roots in physiology .",
    "the problem with using the classical physiology framework with its rigorously controlled conditions to study a large population over a long time period is that it is too expensive , intrusive , and dangerous to collect physiologic data for a large population over a long time period .",
    "thus , it is likely that the lack of availability of population scale , long term data is the primary reason why wide - population , long term , physiologic studies to not exist .    with the advancement of electronic health records ( ehr ) repositories , the `` lack of data '' problem",
    "will be replaced with data analysis and data mining problems .",
    "electronic health records hold data for large , diverse populations , and they cover periods of decades @xcite @xcite @xcite . nevertheless , despite years of work , the methods needed to exploit ehr data remain in their infancy . a necessary realization for using ehr data",
    "is recognizing that the ehr represents a natural system in its own right .",
    "in particular , ehr data not only represents the physiology of the diverse population being cared for , but also the following : the hospital measurement dynamics ( e.g. , individual hospital protocols ) ; the local environment ( e.g. , exposure to pollutants ) ; local customs ( e.g. , willingness to seek medical attention ) ; and any other features of the environment in which the data is collected . to see some of the difficulties and potential associated with the analysis of ehr data ,",
    "consider four notably relevant examples : ( i ) ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrates the limitations of using general population ehr data for estimating drug dosages ; ( ii ) ref .",
    "@xcite reveals difficulties with using general ehr data for classification of disease ( i.e. , community - acquired pneumonia ) often required manual intervention to achieve accurate results ; ref .",
    "@xcite outlines various factors that will constrain ehr data ; and ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that relevant , predictive , phenomenological master equations of physiological functioning ( concentrations of red blood cells ) can be generated using data that _",
    "could _ exist in an ehr repository ( note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the population dynamics refers to a population of red blood cells ) and that , if integrated into a ehr infrastructure , would help with early prevention of disease ( i.e. , anemia ) .",
    "advancing such methods is a stepwise process , and here we present what we believe is an important early step : showing that it is feasible to use ehr data in conjunction with a constructive physiological model  specifically , that we can test a physiologic model with an ehr data - derived signal .    to study how",
    "ehr data can be used in conjunction with a physiological model , we consider the relatively simple problem of glucose variation because it is easy to present and understand , it has relevant , well understood models , and because we know what the answer should be . specifically , we leverage the following tools or data sets : ( i ) a subpopulation patients with at least two glucose measurements from an ehr that includes all in - patients and outpatients seen at an academic medical center over 20 years ; ( ii ) a well sampled patient from the same previously mentioned ehr ; ( iii ) a set of particularly sick , continuously fed , immobile , comatose patients taken from the neural intensive care unit ( nicu ) portion of the previously mentioned ehr ; ( iv ) a relatively simple mechanistic glucose - insulin model with various different feeding regiments ; and ( v ) , the time - delay mutual information ( tdmi ) which quantifies _ nonlinear correlation _ between _ ensembles _ of measurements separated by a given amount of time .",
    "along with demonstrating that ehr data can be used to test physiologic models for populations over long time periods , we also discover that while human glucose levels are highly aperiodic , there is nevertheless a stable , long term diurnal structure in the _ nonlinear correlation _ between glucose values separated in time in healthy , `` wild '' humans .",
    "moreover , while it is likely that many features contribute to the observed diurnal cycle in correlated glucose , only _ two _ interacting time - scales are required to reproduce the observed diurnal signal  a `` statistically periodic '' feeding regiment that exists on the scale of weeks and the organ level dynamics that exists on the order of minutes .",
    "less broadly , we find that : ( i ) to first order statistical moment ( e.g. , the mean ) , daily variation in the tdmi is a function of feeding alone  no diversity in other parameters that determine glucose / insulin regulation are required;(ii ) that glucose regulation acts like a control system on a fast time scale ( order of minutes ) in contrast to kidney function which behaves like a filtering system @xcite ; ( iii ) a diurnal signal in a derived value , nonlinear correlation ( tdmi ) , that can be used to distinguish different populations ; and ( iv ) it is possible to circumvent inter - patient variability though aggregating populations , but one must be very careful interpreting the results @xcite .",
    "this work was approved by the columbia university institutional review board .",
    "informed consent was waived by the institutional review board for this retrospective research .",
    "there are many ways to conceptualize the portion of the endocrine system that controls glucose / insulin regulation ; for our purposes we will consider two , the more concrete picture of the endocrine system as a mechanistic , cellular , physiological machine and the more abstract picture of the endocrine system as a control system @xcite for glucose / insulin regulation .",
    "beginning with the concrete mechanistic model , we use the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite which consists of six odes , specifically : @xmath0 and a three stage linear filter : @xmath1 where the state variables correspond to : @xmath2 , plasma insulin ; @xmath3 , remote insulin ; @xmath4 , glucose ; and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 which correspond to three parameterized delay processes .",
    "parameters include : ( i ) @xmath8 , a rate constant for exchange of insulin between the plasma and remote compartments ; ( ii ) @xmath9 , the exogenous ( externally driven ) glucose delivery rate ; @xmath10 , the time constant for plasma insulin degradation ; ( iii ) @xmath11 , the time constant for the remote insulin degradation ; ( iv ) @xmath12 , the delay time between plasma insulin and glucose production ; ( v ) @xmath13 , the volume of insulin distribution in the plasma ; ( vi ) @xmath14 , the volume of the remote insulin compartment ; ( vii ) @xmath15 , the volume of the glucose space ; ( viii ) @xmath16 , insulin secretion ; ( ix ) @xmath17 , insulin - independent glucose utilization ; ( x ) @xmath18 , insulin - dependent glucose utilization ( @xmath19 ) ; and ( xi ) @xmath20 , insulin - dependent glucose utilization .",
    "note that a full list of the parameters in this model , as well the model parameter settings used in this paper , can be found in table [ table : model_parameters ] ; moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite provides a nice discussion of this particular model . with the exception of the exogenous glucose delivery rates , which we will discuss shortly , we utilize all the standard parameter settings used in ref .",
    "finally , there do exist more complex , higher order glucose / insulin metabolism models@xcite , but because the point was to choose the simplest system of odes that can be used to represent the data - driven signal , we chose this rather standard model .    reaching beyond this model , it is important to note that a complete physiological understanding of the endocrine system , or even the glucose / insulin cycle , has not yet been achieved .",
    "for instance , how insulin reacts at the plasma membrane of insulin sensitive cells is still poorly understood ( for other examples , c.f .",
    ", @xcite @xcite ) . with respect to diurnal cycles in glucose / insulin dynamics , the following effects",
    "have been observed : in _ fasting humans _ , there are wake - sleep cycle based effects on pancreatic enzyme secretions @xcite ; physical activity has an effect on insulin secretion @xcite ; and in rats there appears to be an endogenous circadian oscillator ( internal clock ) located within the pancreatic islets @xcite .",
    "most importantly , it is well understood that nutrition intake is the primary first order driver of the glucose - insulin cycle @xcite ( hence the need to use fasting humans as a control to isolate the more sensitive glucose - insulin effects . )",
    "all of these studies were carried out under the classical physiology framework . moreover , to resolve many of the previously listed signals required rigorous control of the measured individuals  most ehr data will never meet these standards .",
    "but , the noted contrast between classical physiology data and ehr data helps clarify the goal of this paper : we are not trying to discover an ultra - sensitive , controlled , physiological effect that is resolvable over a short time period ; rather , we are trying to discover what can be resolved with ehr data .",
    "specifically , we are trying to discover gross , long term , population - wide effects that have the potential to help stratify populations into observably different types  types that can eventually be linked to different health states .",
    "moreover , because the individuals within the ehr have observably differing health states that do not require ultra - fine resolution to observe , the hope is that we will be able to eventually use ehr data to discover and categorize different , long term , physiologic macrostates .",
    "hence the justification for not choosing the most complicated glucose / insulin model .",
    "while the model we utilize parameterizes away many of these higher - order effects , it remains driven by nutrition , the source of the first order , elementary glucose / insulin dynamics we are trying to verify .    to interpret the results , it will help to abstract the physical mechanisms to a control system .",
    "in particular , the regulation of glucose can be thought of as an intra - body feedback control system where the body _ has a goal of maintaining a constant concentration of glucose _ and attempts to achieve this goal via various physiological mechanisms .",
    "broadly , when glucose levels are high , insulin is released by the pancreas leading to glucose being stored in the liver faster than it is released _ and _ the rate at which glucose is metabolized by the body is increased .",
    "similarly , when glucose levels are low , glucagon is released by the pancreas , allowing for an increase in the rate glucose is released from the liver as well as a decrease in the rate glucose is metabolized by the body .",
    "this contrasts with , for example , the kidneys and their relation with creatinine , which can be grossly thought of as a filtering system instead of a control system aiming at maintaining a particular level of glucose .",
    "the only part of the model we vary is the external driving , or the _ exogenous glucose delivery rate _ , @xmath21 ; specifically , we consider four different feeding regiments .",
    "the first feeding regiment we consider is a population that is feed continuously and where each member of the population is fed at a different rate .",
    "this feeding regiment is meant to simulate an intensive care unit population and is denoted by the feeding function @xmath22 .",
    "the other three feeding regiments are based on simulated meals . to construct mealtime feeding structure ,",
    "begin by defining the set of meal times , specified by the set @xmath23 , where the @xmath24 s represent times over a @xmath25-hour interval , and @xmath26 is the number of meal times within a @xmath25-hour period .",
    "next define the exogenous glucose delivery rate at the current time , @xmath27 , as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the peak rate of delivery of glucose for a given individual @xmath30 at time @xmath24 , @xmath31 represents the total number of meals that have passed by time @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the decay constant ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the decay constant is set such that the meal persists over about two hours , a time that is considered realistic @xcite .",
    "next , relative to the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , define the following three feeding regiments : _ periodic individual _ , @xmath38 $ ] ; _ noisy individual _ , @xmath39 $ ] where @xmath40 is a uniform random variable on the interval @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath33 represents an integer day ( implying that @xmath42 changes every day ) ; and _ random individual _ , @xmath43 $ ] where @xmath40 is a random ( non - repeated ) integer on the interval @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath33 is again an integer day ( implying that @xmath42 changes every day ) .",
    "we now have four feeding regiments , _ continuously fed population _ ( @xmath45 ) , a periodically fed individual ( @xmath46 ) , a noisy - periodic individual ( @xmath47 ) , and a random individual ( @xmath48 ) , defined formally as : @xmath49 \\text { mg / min } \\\\",

    "@xmath13 & @xmath50 l + @xmath14 & @xmath51 l + @xmath15 & @xmath52 l + @xmath8 & @xmath53 l min@xmath54 + @xmath10 & @xmath55 min + @xmath11 & @xmath56 min + @xmath12 & @xmath57 min + @xmath58 & @xmath59 mu min@xmath54 + @xmath60 & @xmath61 + @xmath62 & @xmath63 mg l@xmath54 + @xmath64 & @xmath65 mg l@xmath54 + @xmath66 & @xmath56 mg l@xmath54 + @xmath67 & @xmath68 mu l@xmath54 + @xmath69 & @xmath70 mu l@xmath54 + @xmath71 & @xmath72 mg min@xmath54 + @xmath73 & @xmath74 mg min@xmath54 + @xmath75 & @xmath76 mg min@xmath54 + @xmath77 & @xmath78 mg min@xmath54 + @xmath79 & @xmath80 + @xmath81 & @xmath82 +      we consider the time series of glucose measurements of two real populations of humans extracted from the columbia university medical center ( cumc ) ehr : ( i ) the time series of glucose measurements extracted from an ehr for all inpatients and outpatients over 20 years ( @xmath83 patients with roughly @xmath84 glucose measurements ) ; ( ii ) the time series of glucose measurements for a small subset of patients ( @xmath85 in total ) seen in the nicu who are continuously fed , immobile , and comatose  note that this cohort of patients is represented by between @xmath74 and @xmath86 measurements taken on the order of minutes to hours ( many patients have approximately a weeks worth of hourly measurements )",
    ". there are four important differences in these populations : ( i ) population one is uncontrolled and monitored poorly ( it is the general patient population after all ) whereas population two is highly controlled and monitored ; ( ii ) population one has an unknown and uncontrolled feeding regiment whereas population two is being fed continuously and in a very controlled and documented fashion ; ( iii ) population one represents a diverse set of humans with diverse and unknown health states whereas population two represents a very sick population whose degree of acuity is considerably higher and more narrowly defined than that of population one ; and ( iv ) while the detailed understanding of metabolic function is unknown in both populations , it is very likely that the metabolic functioning of patients in population two is substantially more compromised .",
    "thus , population two functions roughly as a control to isolate the effects of continuous feeding on glucose daily variability because this population has relatively few normal external physiological forcing mechanisms ( e.g. , sleep cycle , daily exercise , etc ) .",
    "in contrast , population one is meant to represent the population at large whose feeding regiment is uncontrolled , highly discontinuous , and has unknown regularity .",
    "in addition to the two populations , we have included two relatively densely and uniformly measured , non - icu patient from the cumc ehr .",
    "we have included these patients to demonstrate that , despite population - aggregation effects on glucose variability ( recall that ref .",
    "@xcite detailed how aggregation of different sources can affect a tdmi signal ) the diurnal tdmi peaks do occur in regular patients .",
    "these patients were selected from among the @xmath56 patients with the most glucose values in the cumc ehr and they represent the two typical types of patients  patients with high and patients with low diurnal tdmi peaks . neither patients glucose measurements come primarily from the icu setting .",
    "we _ speculate _ that the magnitude of the diurnal peak is related to the relative health of the pancreas ( or successful glucose regulation ) because the patient with the relatively small diurnal tdmi - based peak has a failing pancreas .",
    "nevertheless , due to the complexity of the models and patients , resolving the source of the higher order features of the tdmi distribution ( e.g. , the higher order moments ) of the @xmath25-hour tdmi peaks among patients is beyond the scope of paper .",
    "we use two diagnostics for the ehr and model glucose time series , ( i ) intra - patient normalized glucose by hour , and ( ii ) the tdmi of the glucose time series ( ref .",
    "@xcite explains how the tdmi can be applied to a population ) .",
    "with respect to ( i ) , we normalize each patient to mean zero and unit variance , and then calculate the mean and variance of glucose by hour over the population .",
    "we do this because there is a high degree of individual variability within each population , and individuals were measured differently from each other . therefore , to resolve a property such as the by - hour daily variation of glucose values , we must remove inter - individual variation . without this correction , inter - individual variation and",
    "therefore population aggregation effects became the first order effects .",
    "with respect to ( ii ) , we calculate the tdmi @xcite , @xcite , given by : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 represent an ensemble of _ all the intra - patient pairs of points in the population of time series separated by a time @xmath90 _ and @xmath91 denotes the pdf of those ensembles ; note that the tdmi captures linear and nonlinear correlations in time , which differs from , say , auto or linear correlation calculations ( to see this applied to kidney function , see @xcite , and for general application , see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , to calculate the tdmi , one must estimate the joint and marginal pdfs , here we used a kde estimation routine @xcite implemented on matlab .    in general ,",
    "the tdmi is a unit - less quantity ; a tdmi of @xmath92 ( within bias ) implies that there is no correlation between sequential values in a time series for a given @xmath90 .",
    "tdmi values begin to become important when they exceed the expected bias associated with calculating the mutual information , which is approximately @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the number of pairs of points used to estimate the tdmi ( @xmath95 in this experiment ) . with a perfect correlation between sequential values ,",
    "the tdmi will be equal to the entropy ( or auto - information ) of the series , which is numerically equal to the tdmi at @xmath96 ( and is calculated automatically as part of the experiment ) . in this experiment",
    "the entropy was about @xmath97 and represented the maximum tdmi .",
    "( in most of our experiments , the entropy is in the @xmath98 to @xmath99 range . )    with respect to the models , the odes were integrated over time - periods ranging from seven days to three weeks .",
    "a standard fourth - order runga - kutta integration routine , with a step - size of @xmath100 , was utilized .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] details the feeding - glucose response for the models . the point of this figure is to depict the basic building blocks that will be aggregated into a population .",
    "figure [ fig : model_a ] demonstrates that , relative to the model , a _ continuous _ infusion of glucose induces a periodic oscillation in intravascular glucose whose period is on the order of minutes ; note that verification of this signal in humans can be found in fig .",
    "@xmath101 of ref .",
    "@xcite or more generally ref .",
    "furthermore , note that _ in this case _ the glucose oscillation is _ exactly symmetric about its mean _ , implying that long term averages of the glucose - insulin response should be a constant  this fits with the intuitive control theory vision of the glucose - insulin cycle .",
    "figure [ fig : model_b ] illustrates the glucose oscillation structure that is induced when the feeding regiment consists of three realistic meals given at @xmath102 , @xmath57 , and @xmath103 hundred hours respectively .",
    "note that the peaks and length of time over which the glucose response exists depends on the magnitude of the calories in the meal  one way of conceptualizing this system is as a forced oscillator with damping that depends on caloric input and metabolism . also note that the when caloric intake is a pulse , the glucose - insulin response is _ not _ symmetric about the mean or baseline . in particular , isolating the glucose response and integrating the response relative to the baseline yields a very small but negative number , meaning that the overall glucose level is depressed when integrated over the course of the meal and response relative to this model .      with the basic building blocks of glucose - insulin response in place ,",
    "next consider fig .",
    "[ fig : general_patients ] which details the hourly glucose variability within the data sets and models .",
    "in particular , in fig . [",
    "fig : general_patients_a ] the hourly glucose variability for the ehr population displays _ no diurnal variability _ or signal . while we expected the short - term oscillations to average out we also expected to observe a small but statistically significant signal on a 24-hour cycle that matched meal times .",
    "more specifically , we expected a small diurnal signal because : ( i ) humans eat periodically , which , intuitively , implies that glucose would be broadly higher over meal times ; and ( ii ) , there exists a _ weak but present diurnal variability _ in kidney function that was observed on the same data set @xcite  which was surprising in and of itself because kidney function is not normally believed to have a strong diurnal signal .",
    "the fact that there is no signal is due , at a fundamental level , to the fact that the endocrine system always acts as a fast controller ; from the control theory perspective of the glucose / insulin system , the lack of hourly glucose variability is indeed what one might expect .",
    "specifically , because the endocrine system attempts to keep the glucose level constant , or within a given interval , and because the endocrine system works on a fast time scale ( e.g. , seconds to tens of minutes ) , the glucose / insulin _ dynamics _ of the endocrine system are relatively fast  much faster than an hour  and thus small changes in meal times will force glucose levels to average out when _ hourly _ glucose levels are averaged over many days .    a comparison of the data - based signals in figs .",
    "[ fig : general_patients_a ] and [ fig : general_patients_b ] with the modeling results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : general_patients_d ] leads to the following observations / conclusions . _",
    "first _ , constant feeding in the model for a population leads to constant ( averaged by hour ) glucose which agrees with the data - based result ( nicu patients ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : general_patients_b ] , and thus verifies that relative to hourly glucose variability , the model correctly predicts the observations . _",
    "second _ , the periodically driven individual has the expected daily meal response structure ; but the signal is too clean to realistically represent an individual or a population . _",
    "third _ , the random feeding produces no diurnal signal and thus agrees with the data - based result ( wild population ) from fig .",
    "[ fig : general_patients_a ] , meaning that it is possible either that the model does not depend on strongly on feeding structure or that the by - hour glucose is nt good enough to detect feeding structure and differentiate the respective populations . and _ fourth _ the noisy periodic case has wide , weak diurnal peaks at meal times which differs from what is observed in the data ; however , the primary reason the diurnal structure in daily glucose variability is retained in the models with noisy periodic - like feeding is that the meals are uniformly distributed within two hour _ disjoint _ intervals .",
    "we know from further experiments that increasing the _ diversity of the location of the mealtime windows between individuals , while retaining the noisy mealtime structure within individuals _ , allows the model results to reproduce the population signal shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : general_patients_a ] more faithfully .    finally , considering the model output shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_b ] where the glucose - insulin response to a meal _ is roughly symmetric about the baseline glucose level _ , implying that the _ average _ glucose over many data points _ should _ be at least near zero when averaged over time and a population , the data - based results in fig . [",
    "fig : general_patients ] are not surprising .",
    "but , _ what is a surprise _ is that this simple model _ can accurately represent a population over much longer time periods than it was designed to represent . _ or , more specifically , while the model we use here is an ultradian model designed to be applicable on a time - scale of much less than a day , the model nevertheless appears to be applicable over time periods considerably longer than a day .",
    "finally we arrive at the nonlinear - correlation variability in glucose as quantified by the tdmi .",
    "figure [ fig : tdmi_a ] frames the tdmi over an entire seven day time - delay window .",
    "the following features of [ fig : tdmi_a ] are of note : * ( i ) * all models and data sets show a sharp decay in tdmi between one and twelve hours ; * ( ii ) * one of the individual patients has weak diurnal peaks in the tdmi at @xmath25 and @xmath104 hours while the other patient has diurnal peaks for several days ; * ( iii ) * the nicu population shows no long term structure in the tdmi , although there does remain a constant amount of tdmi present ; * ( iv ) * the uncontrolled ehr population shows diurnal peaks in the tdmi , and the magnitude of these peaks decays with time ; * ( v ) * the continuously fed population model , after the decay within twelve hours , shows a weak hump at eighteen hours that is a function of the exact symmetry of the periodic oscillations in glucose , followed by a decay to small , constant , tdmi  _ thus , this model case accurately represents the nicu patients _ ; * ( vi ) * the periodic _ individual _ model patient without noise has a good deal of tdmi as well as sharp diurnal peaks and  note that from this it is self - evident that an individual patient with a continuous feeding regiment would also have a high level of tdmi , albeit without the sharp 24-hour peaks ; * ( vii ) * noisy periodic model has , after the sharp decay at twelve hours , diurnal peaks in the tdmi with _ non - decaying _ magnitude  _ thus , this model mostly closely represents the real ehr population , and in fact the two overlay up to about @xmath105 hours _ ; * ( viii ) * the tdmi for the randomly fed model case has no long term structure  _ thus , the tdmi helps distinguish the constant feeding , the random feeding , and the noisy periodic feeding models . _ to consider more detailed analysis , it is instructive to split fig .",
    "[ fig : tdmi_a ] into two regimes , @xmath106 hrs , and @xmath107 hours .    the most important feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : tdmi_b ] is that the collection of tdmi curves are _ bounded from above by the random feeding and below by the population with continuous feeding models _ respectively .",
    "the random meal case has the most tdmi within the first @xmath57 hours because the random feeding case maximizes the amount of observed tdmi per mealtime period .",
    "this maximization occurs for two reasons : ( i ) isolated meals have a large amount of tdmi that persists over approximately four hours ; and ( ii ) , meals are uniformly distributed over the @xmath25 hour period and are unlikely to overlap .",
    "said simply , the tdmi for the random meals population with @xmath108 largely represents the pure _ intra - meal _ tdmi , which is the maximum tdmi amongst the models ( and apparently real populations ) we examine .",
    "this argument is further backed - up by the fact that the randomly fed population has the sharpest decay in tdmi .",
    "the reason why the tdmi for the population of continuously fed patient model is a lower - bound is due to a combination of aggregation effects and superpositions of periodic orbits . to understand this , recall fig .",
    "[ fig : model_a ] and note that each member of the population of continuously fed patients will have orbits with _",
    "different amplitudes and frequencies _ and that aggregating them together at a given @xmath90 will produce a distribution that will closely resemble a uniform distribution  the distribution that minimizes tdmi over all distributions .",
    "all the other cases fit in between these two extreme situations .",
    "the longer the time ( separation ) scale is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdmi_c ] and includes the tdmi for all cases over time - separations of @xmath57 to @xmath72 hours .",
    "begin by noting that there is no structure in tdmi signal for the nicu population as well as the random feeding and continuously fed population models .",
    "thus , using only the tdmi and the normalized hourly glucose , it is difficult to distinguish the continuously fed population from the randomly fed population .",
    "in contrast , the ehr population , by displaying the diurnal peaks , is easily distinguishable from the nicu population ; thus the tdmi helps distinguish the ehr and nicu populations in a way that analysis of the raw glucose values could not . moreover , because the noisy feeding and ehr populations strongly resemble one another ( they are nearly identical for @xmath109 $ ] hours ) , and because the exactly periodic feeding yields far to much tdmi , _ the difference between the ehr population and the nicu population is likely due to noisy , but specifically structured ( i.e. , not totally random ) meal times .",
    "_ this conclusion both confirms that ehr data reproduces what is believed to be the first order glucose dynamical effect , nutrition , and verifies that the ultradian model can represent humans for much longer time scales than hours to minutes .",
    "finally , even the individual patient with the weakest signal shows a peak at @xmath25 hours and a weak peak at @xmath104 hours , which is consistent with the ehr - based tdmi signal .      based on fig .",
    "[ fig : tdmi_c ] , _ the most basic and elemental result is thus : the model output can be used ( in conjunction with the tdmi ) to correctly predict the distinction between general ehr patients and nicu patients on time scales longer than a day .",
    "_ moreover , the observed tdmi signal for the ehr population represents _ noisy , but structured meal times over the population _ ; meaning , _ we can detect human behavior patterns in ehr data and verify / test them with / against physiological models_. that is , adjusting the feeding in the model alone was enough to account for the difference in the observed tdmi signals and thus to distinguish the populations , all without injecting difference ( e.g. , differences in mean age ) into the parameters .",
    "this implies that ehr data can at least resolve some first order physiological effects . at a finer resolution , while the first order moment of the tdmi ( i.e. , predictability ) can be used to separate the two populations of patients because of how nutrition is ingested , understanding the second order moment is more complicated and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "more explicitly , it is likely that the higher order moments of the tdmi peaks will depend , to some unknown level of detail , on the health state of the patient .",
    "moreover , because even narrow ehr populations are relatively diverse and as yet unquantified in the context at hand , and because even the simple model we used has @xmath110 parameters that we hold fixed _ for all populations examined here _ that are nevertheless are available for variation , resolution of the higher order moments of the tdmi peak is beyond the scope of the current paper . nevertheless , preliminary analysis seems to point to the tdmi being monotonically dependent on nutrition and the functioning ( or artificial regulation ) of the pancreas .",
    "finally , we were able to use ehr data to test a physiological model for a population , but , as is the case with many other data - driven fields , derived values ( i.e. , the tdmi ) were more helpful than the raw values .",
    "the end goal of population physiology is twofold : ( i ) we want to derive population - scale , data - based signals over medium to long time - scales in a way that can be connected to constructive , mechanistic models to further the understanding of human physiology ; and ( ii ) we want to be able to use these verified , constructive , mechanistic models to affect the health of human beings via clinical care . in this paper , we have demonstrated ( i ) but not ( ii ) , primarily because glucose / insulin modeling is not yet at a stage were it can be applied to affect clinical care in a direct manner .",
    "nevertheless , we have begun one of the necessary steps for implementing ( ii ) , we have demonstrated that simple mechanistic models can accurately represent humans over the longer time scales that are relevant to clinical outcomes .",
    "scientifically , the results in this work demonstrate and imply that : * ( i ) * the output from a simple glucose / insulin model can be used to predict the difference between ehr and nicu patients over time periods longer than a day ; * ( ii ) * glucose measurements for a population yield diurnal variation in _ correlation _ , but glucose measurements _ do not vary diurnally _ when aggregated over time and population because the glucose / insulin system behaves like a control system whose fast time - scale dynamics occur on the order of minutes ; * ( iii ) * `` normal '' ( here normal means , humans not being fed intravenously ) humans _ do _ have a diurnal tdmi signal in glucose ; * ( iv ) * `` normal '' human glucose values _ do _ display an initial decay in correlations ( between subsequent measurements ) to a relative baseline within @xmath57 hours ; * ( v ) * the models with the noisy but structured meal times match the diurnal tdmi ehr signal , thus the diurnal cycle in predictability of glucose is primarily driven by nutrition ( not an internal clock ) ; * ( vi ) * ehr data can resolve a signal that spans multiple time scales and can be used to test physiological models ; * ( vii ) * that the standard glucose / insulin model @xcite is applicable beyond the time - spans it was designed for ; * ( viii ) * the nicu population and continuous feeding model tdmi signals match one another  in particular , humans being fed continuously _ do not _ have a diurnal tdmi signal or any structured signal at all ; and * ( ix ) * ehr data resolves human social behavior  the structure of meal times .",
    "looking forward , currently , population physiology suffers from the lack of existent , time - dependent signals ; discovering such signals that can be related to physiological models is where many current opens problems lie .",
    "said differently , before one can go about refining models and understanding dynamics mechanistically and over longer time periods , one needs actual data - based signals , or stylized facts @xcite , that can suggest and motivate refinements in the models via _ testing _ of those models .",
    "nevertheless , this does not negate the need for constructive modeling that allows for either interaction with clinical care or better reflection of known physiological problems  for it is through qualitative understanding of models as dynamical and control systems @xcite that actionable clinical interventions will come .",
    "relative to glucose / insulin regulation , in some circumstances , monitoring and correcting for hyperglyceimia can help reduce mortality significantly @xcite . nevertheless , correlation is not causation ; the _ mechanistic reasons _ why glucose control in icu populations helps with outcomes is not well understood , and thus optimal clinical interventions remain unavailable .",
    "the inevitable conclusion is that glucose / insulin dynamics are poorly understood on longer time scales ; and moreover , the current state of glucose / insulin physiological modeling does not have a mechanism for understanding the fundamental physiological problems ( i.e. , longer term effects of glucose dynamics ) that can suggest productive clinical interventions ( e.g. , icu glucose control and regulation ) .",
    "but , again , such models can not be developed without impetus , and that impetus must come in the form of concrete , data - based signals .",
    "while the data scarcity has made such signals difficult to come by , ehr data will put the data scarcity problems behind us and replace these problems with new signal processing problems that must be overcome .",
    "this paper represents a step forward in this direction by using ehr data to discover a physiologic - based signal that is connected to physiologic - based models even in the circumstance where direct observation of the physiological variable does not yield a signal that can stratify the population .",
