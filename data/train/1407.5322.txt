    "the quantum nature of gravity is one of the most important subjects in theoretical physics .",
    "it is getting even more important because the higgs mass measured in lhc suggests that the standard model would be valid all the way up to the planck scale . in this",
    "talk we explain the lattice gauge theory can play crucial role in the study of the quantum gravity .    superstring theory is a promising candidate of the theory of everything , which unifies the standard model of particle physics and gravity . in particular , it provides us with a consistent theory of quantum gravity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : string_scattering ] scattering of two closed strings is shown .",
    "strings propagate from left to right and sweep a two - dimensional surface called ` world - sheet . ' in the left figure , two closed strings interact and merge to a single closed string , and then it splits to two .",
    "this is the tree level diagram . in the right figure ,",
    "a loop of closed strings appear as an intermediate state .",
    "each closed string loop multiplies a factor @xmath1 to the amplitude , where @xmath2 is the string coupling constant ; a diagram with @xmath3 closed string loops , which is represented by a genus-@xmath3 surface , carries a factor @xmath4 .    in principle",
    ", one can take into account the quantum correction order by order by increasing the genus .",
    "but it is just a perturbative definition at best .",
    "how can one formulate string theory nonperturbatively ?    in 1970s t hooft pointed out a deep relationship between the yang - mills theory with the @xmath5 gauge group and string theory , based on the @xmath0 expansion around the t hooft large-@xmath6 limit ( i.e. @xmath7 fixed ) . because the gauge field is represented by @xmath8 matrices ,",
    "the propagator is represented by two lines , which represent the row and column , respectively .",
    "the interaction is described by three- and four - point vertices ( fig .",
    "[ fig : interaction_vertices ] ) .",
    "a typical example of feynman diagrams is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamical_triangulation ] .",
    "it contains the vertices , propagators and closed loops of matrix indices . because the action is written as @xmath9 , each vertex and propagator are associated with @xmath6 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "a closed loop carries a factor @xmath6 because a sum over the index , which runs from @xmath11 to @xmath6 , is involved .",
    "therefore , each vacuum diagram is proportional to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .    as a next step , we relate feynman diagrams to two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "intuitively , a feynman diagram with many lines looks like a dense ` fishnet ' , which eventually becomes indistinguishable from a continuum two - dimensional surface . in order to make this intuition mathematically",
    "well - defined , let us notice that a feynman diagram can be translated to a two - dimensional surface made of triangles and quadrangles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamical_triangulation ] . from the figure it is easy to see that",
    "@xmath14 therefore @xmath15 which is the euler number of the two - dimensional surface . note that the euler number depends only on the number of genus @xmath3 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphere ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : torus ] .",
    "therefore , it is natural to identify the string world - sheet and the coupling constant @xmath2 with the feynman diagram and @xmath0 , respectively . in this picture",
    ", the closed string corresponds to the wilson loop , because gluons sourced by the wilson loop form a cylinder - shaped fishnet , which is identified with the world - sheet swiped by the closed string ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wilsonloop ] ) .",
    "if this identification is correct , then the yang - mills theory provides us with a nonperturbative formulation of string theory , because it is defined without relying on the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "( a usual instanton effect @xmath16 translates into @xmath17 and hence it is nonperturbative also in the context of string theory . )",
    "this argument is rather formal and it was not clear which specific gauge theory describes string theory .",
    "more than 20 years after t hooft s proposal , maldacena conjectured that maximally supersymmetric @xmath5 yang - mills theory in @xmath18 dimensions corresponds to type ii superstring theory on the black @xmath19-brane background @xcite . here",
    "the black @xmath19-brane is a black hole - like object with @xmath19-dimensional spatial extension .",
    "the black @xmath20-brane , which we consider below , is just a black hole .",
    "therefore , if maldacena s conjecture is correct , by studying the @xmath0 correction in yang - mills theory one can learn about quantum gravity .    the gauge / gravity duality conjecture motivated kaplan , katz and unsal to put super yang - mills theories in various dimensions on lattice@xcite .",
    "by now there are various lattice and non - lattice techniques with which one can simulate super yang - mills theories in various dimensions . in this talk we consider the @xmath21-dimensional theory , which is numerically most tractable .",
    "we compare the mass of the black hole and its counterpart in the gauge theory and find a good agreement at finite values of @xmath6 , which provides us with quantitative evidence supporting the maldacena conjecture at finite-@xmath6 and quantum gravity level .",

    "scalar fields @xmath25 describe the fluctuations of d - branes and open strings to the transverse directions .",

    "maldacena conjectured that super yang - mills describes full string dynamics around the black brane and the @xmath0 correction corresponds to the quantum correction .",
    "the hawking temperature and the mass of the black brane are identified with the temperature and the energy @xmath42 of the gauge theory . in this work",
    "we study the case of @xmath43 .",
    "the gauge theory is quantum mechanics of @xmath8 matrices , which was originally proposed as the matrix model of m - theory @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass can be calculated by adding stringy corrections to the black @xmath20-brane geometry shown above .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is dimensionless effective temperature and @xmath46 are unknown constants .",
    "the energy @xmath47 is also made dimensionless , by multiplying @xmath48 . in the following",
    ", we simply set @xmath49 without loss of generality .",
    "higher order terms in each power of @xmath0 represent to the @xmath32 corrections , which appear because strings are not point - like . if maldacena s conjecture is correct , this expression must be reproduced from the matrix quantum mechanics .",
    "the @xmath50 terms of the dual gravity prediction ( [ gravity_prediction ] ) have been tested previously in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath32 correction @xmath51 has been confirmed with @xmath52 , by looking at @xmath53 @xcite .    in order to study the @xmath0 correction",
    ", we must study rather small values of @xmath6 . here",

    "remarkably , this quantity behaves as @xmath58.therefore the first two terms of the @xmath59 expansion agree with the dual gravity prediction , and terms of order @xmath60 and higher are small compared to the @xmath58 term .    as a further test , we estimated the coefficient of @xmath59 by using a fitting ansatz @xmath61 . in fig.[fig :",
    "coeff ] we show this coefficient normalized by the dual gravity prediction , @xmath62 .",
    "it is reasonably close to @xmath11 .",
    "this is very strong evidence that the gauge / gravity duality holds at quantum gravity level .",
    "we have shown the first quantitative evidence for the gauge / gravity duality at the level of finite @xmath6 ( gauge theory side ) and quantum gravity ( gravity side ) beyond kinematics , by studying the finite temperature system in which supersymmetry is broken by the thermal effect .",
    "we studied mass of the black hole in superstring theory and its counterpart in the yang - mills theory , and found good agreement .",
    "it strongly suggests that , as maldacena claimed in the first paper on the gauge / gravity duality @xcite , _ the gauge theory provides us with the nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory_. then , by studying the dynamics of super yang - mills theory on computers , we can learn about quantum gravity .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , we found that the negative specific heat appears at very low temperature ( @xmath63 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "it suggests that the quantum correction drives black hole unstable and makes it evaporate .",
    "if it can be shown more robustly , then the black hole described through the gauge theory would provides us with a concrete counter - example to hawking s information loss paradox @xcite .",
