    "entangled states are very important for quantum computing , teleportation , cryptography @xcite .",
    "although entanglement is a profound concept of quantum information theory its experimental realization in many - body systems is an unsolved problem up to now . meanwhile",
    "the existing criterions of the existence of entanglement @xcite allow us to investigate entangled states in conventional nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "it is well known that entanglement emerges in systems of nuclear spins at microkelvin temperatures @xcite .",
    "such temperatures can be achieved with the adiabatic demagnetization in the rotating reference frame ( adrf ) @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we consider the emergence of entanglement in the course of the adrf in the system of nuclear spins coupled by the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) .",
    "we perform numerical calculations for a chain consisting of nine spins and a plane nine - spin cluster in order to prove the emergence of entanglement of its different subsystems .",
    "we use the wootters criterion  @xcite for the investigation of the spin pair entanglement .",
    "entanglement of subsystems with larger numbers of spins is investigated with the positive partition transposition ( ppt ) criterion  @xcite .",
    "entanglement emerges at approximately the same temperature of the order of microkelvins for all subsystem sizes .",
    "however , the temperature depends on the space dimension of the system .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath1 nuclear spins @xmath0 coupled with the external magnetic field .",
    "the system is irradiated by the frequency - modulated radio - frequency ( rf ) field , @xmath2 which is perpendicular to the permanent magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath3 of the system in the laboratory frame can be written as follows @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the larmor frequency , @xmath6 is the amplitude of the rf field ( in frequency units ) , @xmath7 is the projection of the angular momentum operator of the n - th spin ( @xmath8 ) on the @xmath9 axis ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the secular part of the ddi hamiltonian @xcite which can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ddi coupling constant of spins @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17 the spin dynamics of the system is determined by the density matrix , @xmath18 whose time evolution occurs according to the liouville equation ( @xmath19 )  @xcite @xmath20.\\ ] ] converting the density matrix , @xmath18 with the unitary transformation @xmath21 and neglecting the irrelevant terms oscillating with the double larmor frequency one obtains the evolution equation for the density matrix @xmath22 @xmath23.\\ ] ] according to ( [ liuv ] ) the hamiltonian , @xmath24 of the system can be written in the rotating reference frame ( rrf ) as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the resonance offset of the longitudinal frequency from the larmor frequency . in the course of the adrf , the offset ,",
    "@xmath27 changes slowly in order to satisfy to the adiabatic condition @xcite @xmath28 the condition  ( [ adiabat_cond ] ) means that the resonance offset , @xmath27 changes so slowly that the spin system is in the quasi - equilibrium state at every moment of time  @xcite .",
    "thus the spin system can be described by the thermodynamic quasi - equilibrium density matrix , @xmath29 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is proportional to the inverse temperature ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 is the partition function .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the temperature , @xmath34 is the spin temperature of the system which is isolated from all other degrees of freedom .",
    "the reason of such isolation is long spin - lattice relaxation times which exceed spin - spin relaxation times by several orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the important consequence for our approach is the following .",
    "the decoherence effects at entanglement generation with adrf are irrelevant .",
    "the entropy , @xmath35 of the system is given by @xcite @xmath36\\}.\\ ] ] we start the adrf with @xmath37 where @xmath38}\\}^{1/2}$ ] is the local dipolar field . then the offset , @xmath27 is the linear function of time @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the given quantities . since the entropy , @xmath42 , one can obtain the inverse temperature , @xmath43 in the course of the adrf , if the offset , @xmath27 is known .",
    "it means that we obtain the density matrix , @xmath29 during the adrf .",
    "in particular , the entropy , @xmath35 is @xmath44-\\frac{k}2n\\beta\\delta\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\delta}2\\right)\\ ] ] at @xmath37 .",
    "( [ entr ] ) can be used in order to find the initial inverse temperature of the system .",
    "in order to obtain the reduced density matrix of an arbitrary pair of spins @xmath15 and @xmath45 we use the approach developed in @xcite . the density matrix , @xmath29 of ( [ rho ] ) can be represented as @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath1 is a number of spins in the system , @xmath47 is one of the values @xmath48 @xmath49 is the unit matrix of the dimension @xmath50",
    "@xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a numerical coefficient . averaging the density matrix of ( [ basmatr ] ) over all spins except spins @xmath15 and @xmath45 and taking into account that @xmath55 we arrive at the following expression for the reduced density matrix , @xmath56 of the @xmath15th and @xmath45th spins @xmath57 where @xmath58 the coefficients , @xmath59 of ( [ alpha ] ) can be calculated numerically .",
    "then the reduced density matrix of the pair of spins @xmath15 and @xmath45 is determined completely . in order to apply the wootters criterion @xcite one should find the `` spin - flipped '' density matrix , @xmath60 which is @xmath61^*(\\sigma_y\\otimes\\sigma_y)\\ ] ] where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation in the standard basis @xmath62 and the pauli matrix @xmath63 the calculation of the density matrix , @xmath60 and the diagonalization of the matrix product @xmath64 are performed numerically .",
    "the concurrence of the two  spin system with the density matrix @xmath65 is equal to  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the product @xmath71",
    "the spin pair entangled states are a simple type of entanglement which can be described with the wootters criterion @xcite completely",
    ". meanwhile entanglement of bigger subsystems of the system can also emerge in the course of the adrf . a necessary condition of separability is described by the peres criterion  @xcite which is known as the positive partition transposition ( ppt ) criterion  @xcite .",
    "according to the criterion , entanglement emerges , if after the transposition of the density matrix over variables of one subsystem there are some negative eigenvalues of the density matrix of the system .",
    "we wrote a program which allows us to investigate entanglement of an arbitrary subsystem and its environment in the nine - spin chain and in the square nine - spin cluster in the course of the adrf on the basis of the criterion @xcite .",
    "the ppt predicts the emergence of the spin pair entanglement at the same temperature as the wootters criterion  @xcite .",
    "the ppt criterion uses the sum of the absolute values of negative eigenvalues after the partial transposition of the density matrix as the measure of entanglement .",
    "this measure is called the double negativity  @xcite .",
    "we use the criterions of entanglement  @xcite for the investigation of the entangled states in a nine - spin chain and a plane nine - spin cluster in the next section .",
    "our choice of nine - spin systems is limited by available computational power .",
    "notice that even best available supercomputers do not allow one to calculate spin dynamics when the number of spins in the system exceeds 16  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to noticing that we consider spin - spin interactions of all spins in contrast to the approximation of the nearest neighbor interactions when the number of spins in the system can be significantly increased  @xcite .",
    "the results of the numerical investigation of the spin pair entanglement for a linear chain consisting of nine spins coupled by the ddi at the adrf are represented in figure  [ fig1 ] .     versus the dimensionless inverse temperature , @xmath72 for spins 1 and 2 of the nine - spin chain according to the wootters criterion .",
    "the dash line shows the same result obtained with the ppt criterion ; @xmath73.,width=325 ]    we started the adrf with the offset @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the ddi coupling constant of nearest neighbors in the chain .",
    "the numerical calculations are performed for @xmath76 the corresponding values of the inverse temperatures , @xmath77 are found from ( [ eentr ] ) for the dimensionless entropy @xmath78 figure  [ fig1 ] shows the concurrence of spins 1 and 2 of the nine - spin chain as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath79 at comparatively high temperatures the concurrence is equal to zero ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) and the spin system is in a separable state .",
    "when the temperature is getting sufficiently low in the course of the adrf the concurrence is sharply increasing and entanglement emerges .",
    "the entangled state appears at @xmath80 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) , i. e. at @xmath81 when @xmath82 notice that ordered states of nuclear spins were observed in a @xmath83 single crystal at microkelvin temperatures @xcite .     for spin 1 of the nine - spin chain and the other spins ; @xmath73.,width=325 ]     for the first three spins of the nine - spin chain and the other spins ; @xmath73.,width=325 ]    the dash line in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "demonstrates that the result for the spin pair entanglement obtained with the ppt criterion coincide practically with the ones obtained with the wootters criterion .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the double negativity versus the dimensionless parameter @xmath84 for the first spin of the chain ( the first subsystem ) and the other spins of the chain ( the second subsystem ) in the course of the adrf when the dimensionless entropy @xmath78 one can conclude that entanglement emerges at @xmath85 this result is close to the one for the spin pair entanglement .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the double negativity versus the parameter @xmath84 for the first three spins of the chain ( the first subsystem ) and the other six spins of the chain ( the second subsystem ) at the same conditions . here",
    "entanglement is getting sufficiently large at @xmath86 in fact we have found that entanglement of different subsystem emerges approximately at the same temperature .",
    "the suggested method allows us to study entanglement in the systems of arbitrary space dimensions . as an example",
    ", we consider the square cluster consisting of nine spins ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the dipolar coupling constant of spins j and k ( the numbers of spins are pointed in figure  [ fig4 ] ) is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath89 is the distance between spins @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the angle between the vector , @xmath92 and the external magnetic field , @xmath93 the simple analysis yields @xmath94-[(k-1)/3])^2 + 9(\\{(j-1)/3\\}-\\{(k-1)/3\\})^2},\\ ] ] and @xmath95-[(k-1)/3])^2 + 9(\\{(j-1)/3\\}-\\{(k-1)/3\\})^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the distance between the nearest neighbors in the cluster , @xmath96 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the fractional part of @xmath97 .     for spins 1 , 2 , 4 ( first subsystem ) and",
    "spins 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 ( second subsystem ) , in the square cluster ; @xmath99.,width=438 ]    figure  [ fig5 ] and figure  [ fig6 ] show that the entangled states emerge at @xmath100 in the two - dimensional cluster . although the temperatures of the appearance of entanglement are below here than in the one - dimensional case , they are almost the same for different subsystems . the processes of destructive interference are more effective in the two - dimensional cluster than in the one - dimensional chain .",
    "they lead to a loss of many - spin correlations which are responsible for the appearance of the entangled states .",
    "thus the temperature of the emergence of entanglement is lower in the two - dimensional cluster than in the one - dimensional chain .     for spins 1 , 2 ( first subsystem ) and",
    "spins 3 , 6 , 9 ( second subsystem ) , at @xmath99 in the square cluster of nine spins.,width=438 ]",
    "we investigated numerically entanglement in the chain of nuclear spins and in the square cluster with the ddi in the course of the adrf using a special computer program .",
    "we showed that the entangled states emerge at microkelvin temperatures for typical ddi coupling constants .",
    "two criterions  @xcite of entanglement yield the same results for the spin pair entangled states .",
    "entanglement of different subsystems emerges approximately at the same temperature and the pairwise entanglement can be used as an indicator of entanglement of bigger subsystems .",
    "it is also worth to notice that we take into account the ddi of the remote spins in contrast to the works @xcite where the nearest - neighbor interactions were only considered .",
    "the performed calculations show that there are no the entangled states of remote spins both in one - dimensional and two - dimensional cases .",
    "entanglement emerges only if subsystems are in a direct contact .",
    "entanglement of different subsystems at microkelvin temperatures suggest possible applications of linear spin chains in quantum information processing .    we thank professor d. e. feldman and professor v. a. atsarkin for stimulating discussions and e. i. kuznetsova for assistance in our work .",
