    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors has opened a new window for unveiling the physics of high - temperature superconductivity besides cuprates.@xcite among the various families of iron - based superconductors discovered till now , @xmath1fe@xmath0as@xmath0(@xmath1=alkali earth , alkali , and eu , the so called 122 system ) , which has the thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 structure , was the most investigated due to the easy growth of sizable high - quality single crystals .",
    "@xcite in this 122 system , kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , as the end member of the ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath0as@xmath0 series , shows some unique properties .",
    "firstly , superconductivity with @xmath4 @xmath5 4 k can be realized in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 without purposely doping .",
    "secondly , very clean single crystal with residual resistivity ratio(rrr ) exceeding 1000 can be quite easily achieved , which is a good start point to study intrinsic physical properties .",
    "it was proposed that inter - band interaction that links the hole and electron fermi surfaces ( fs ) produces an @xmath6 pairing symmetry in most of the iron - based superconductors .",
    "however , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and the de hass - van alphen ( dhva ) experiments revealed that the electron pockets disappeared and the large hole sheets centered around @xmath7 point dominate fs in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite therefore , the pairing interaction could be distinct from other iron - based superconductors .",
    "the nodes on superconducting gaps have been detected by thermal conductivity , @xcite penetration depth , @xcite and nmr .",
    "@xcite the measurements of thermal conductivity , @xcite specific heat @xcite and penetration depth @xcite support a _ d_-wave superconducting state in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , recent ultrahigh - resolution laser arpes suggests a nodal _ s_-wave superconductor with highly unusual fs - selective multi - gap structure.@xcite whether those nodes are imposed by symmetry or accidental still remains an open question . as a consequence ,",
    "further investigation on analogous compounds would be significant to clarify the underlying physics in @xmath1fe@xmath0as@xmath0 system . in the present article , we will report the crystal growth and characterization of the analogous compound csfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "superconductivity at 2.6 k was observed in the polycrystalline csfe@xmath0as@xmath0 sample .",
    "@xcite but few physical properties have been reported so far because high quality single crystals are not available until now .",
    "the difficulty of growing sizable csfe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystal mainly lies in the extremely high chemical activity and low melting point of cs . in the present article",
    ", we have successfully overcome this problem by using the stainless steel sample container assembly , @xcite which can be sealed in the glove box ( o@xmath0 content is less than 1 ppm ) mechanically . as a result",
    ", sizable high - quality single crystals of csfe@xmath0as@xmath0 were grown .",
    "the csfe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals were characterized by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , and specific heat .",
    "the sharp superconducting transition temperature and obvious specific jump indicate good quality of the single crystals .",
    "high quality csfe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals are grown by the self flux technique .",
    "the cs chunks , fe and as powder were weighted according to the ratio cs : fe : as=6:1:6 .",
    "typically , 1.5 grams of the mixture of fe and as powders were loaded into a 10 mm diameter alumina crucible , and freshly cut cs pieces were placed on top of the mixture .",
    "then the alumina crucible with a lid was sealed in a stainless steel container assembly .",
    "the whole preparation process was carried out in the glove box in which high pure argon atmosphere is filled ( o@xmath0 content is less than 1 ppm ) .",
    "considering the low melting point of cs ( @xmath8=28 @xmath9c ) , the room temperature must be kept blow 20 @xmath9c .",
    "the sealed stainless steel assembly was then sealed inside an evacuated quartz tube .",
    "the quartz tube was placed in a box furnace and slowly heated up to 200 @xmath9c , it was kept at 200 @xmath9c for 400 minutes , which allows full reaction of cs and the mixture .",
    "then the sample was heated up to 950 @xmath9c in 10 hours .",
    "the temperature was kept still for 10 hours and then slowly cooled to 550 @xmath9c at a rate of 3 @xmath9c / h . after cooling down to room temperature by switching off the furnace ,",
    "shiny plate - like crystals can be easily picked up from the alumina crucible .",
    "the single crystals are stable in air or alcohol for several days .",
    "xrd was performed on a smartlab-9 diffracmeter(rikagu ) from 10@xmath10 to 80@xmath11 with a scanning rate of 4@xmath11 per minute .",
    "the actual chemical composition of the single crystal is determined by energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy(edx ) mounted on the field emission scanning electronic microscope ( fesem ) , sirion 200 .",
    "magnetic susceptibility was measured using vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) ( quantum design ) .",
    "the direct current ( dc ) resistivity was measured by conventional four probe method using the ppms-9 t ( quantum design ) .",
    "resistivity and specific heat down to 50 mk were measured in a dilution refrigerator on ppms .",

    "elemental analysis was performed using edx .",
    "a typical edx spectrum is shown in fig.1(a ) , and the obtained atomic ratio of cs : fe : as is roughly 20.76 : 40.52 : 38.71 .",

    "the resistivity begins to drop rapidly at 1.88 k and reaches zero at 1.8 k. the superconducting transition temperature @xmath13 in the following text is defined as the temperature when the resistivity reaches zero .",

    "4(a ) , we show the temperature dependence of the specific heat of csfe@xmath0as@xmath0 down to 50 mk under zero magnetic field . a pronounced jump due to the superconducting transition is observed below 1.8 k , consistent with the resistivity measurement .",
    "this indicates the high quality of the present crystals .",

    "the specific heat jump is only about 31% of @xmath42@xmath44 , which is similar to the case of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite considering the sharp superconducting transition , this feature may be the evidence for the existence of low energy quasiparticle excitation .",
    "@xcite @xmath45@xmath46/@xmath42@xmath13 can be estimated to be about 0.35 .",
    "this is much smaller than the value ( = 1.43 ) expected for bcs superconductors , which could indicate an unconventional pairing symmetry .",
    "in addition , @xmath45@xmath47/@xmath13 at @xmath4 = 1.8 k is estimated to be about 64 mj mol@xmath48 k@xmath49 , far above the @xmath45@xmath47/@xmath13 vs. @xmath4 behavior of other iron - based superconductors , except for that observed in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 . in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 ,",

    "4(b ) , single - band @xmath63-wave and two - band _ s_-wave model give rise to better fitting quality .",
    "@xcite the low - temperature part of the specific heat roughly follows linear temperature dependence rather than exponent , so the gap symmetry is likely @xmath63-wave .",
    "the thermal conductivity measured on the same batch of csfe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals indicates nodal superconducting gap symmetry.@xcite it has been reported that there is an anomaly around 0.7 k in @xmath26 of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , which was thought to be related to the impurity contribution in the sample , @xcite and higher quality of crystals can almost eliminate such anomaly .",
    "@xcite a very weak anomaly - like feature is observed below 0.55 k in our data too , which may affect the result of the fit .",
    "this makes it hard to make sure the pairing symmetry from our fittings , since the main difference between the fitting in @xmath72-wave and two - band @xmath73-wave models lies below 0.55 k. further measurements , such as arpes and nmr , should be performed to illustrate the pairing symmetry .",
