    "recent studies on network science demonstrate that cellular networks are described by universal features , which are also present in non - biological complex systems , as for example social networks or _ www _ @xcite .",
    "most networks encountered in real world have scale - free topology , in particular networks of fundamental elements of cells as proteins and chemical substrates @xcite . in these networks ,",
    "the distribution of node degree follows a power - law as @xmath4 ( i.e. , frequency of the nodes that are connected to @xmath1 other nodes ) .",
    "the degree of a node is the number of other nodes to which it is connected .",
    "one of the most successful models for explaining that scale - free topology was proposed by _ barabsi - albert _ @xcite , which introduced a mean - field method to simulate the growth dynamics of individual nodes in a _",
    "continuum theory _ framework .",
    "however , although that model was a milestone to understand the behavior of real complex networks , it could not reproduce all the observed features in real networks such as clustering dependence . in order to bring under a single framework all the observed properties of biological networks _",
    "rasvasz et al .",
    "_ suggested successfully a hierarchical and modular topology @xcite .",
    "these observed properties of networks with @xmath5 nodes are : scale - free of degree distribution @xmath4 , power - law scaling of clustering coefficient @xmath0 and a high value for the average of the clustering coefficient @xmath6 and its independence with network size .",
    "a network with these properties is called hierarchical network .    in the hierarchical model @xcite ( the rsmob model in what follows ) ,",
    "the network is simultaneously scale - free and has a high clustering coefficient that is independent of the network size .",
    "the key signature of hierarchical modularity is the dependence of the clustering coefficient as a function of the node degree @xmath1 , which follows @xmath7 .",
    "the meaning of this result is that nodes with a few links have a high clustering degree , being the centers of numerous interlinked modules .",
    "on the other hand , highly connected nodes ( hubs ) have smaller clustering coefficient , being their tasks to connect different modules . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that many real networks ( biological and non - biological ) have a hierarchical organization . one of them , which is the subject of our study , is the metabolic network .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the metabolic network is an example of bipartite networks @xcite . in a bipartite network",
    "there are two kinds of nodes and edges only connect nodes of different kinds . in the metabolic network",
    "these nodes are chemical compounds and reactions .",
    "the network generated by the chemical compounds ( reactions ) is called compound ( reaction ) projection . a line graph transformation ( i.e.",
    ", each edge between two compounds becomes a node ( reaction ) of the transformed network ) relates both projections .",
    "a detailed analysis of the line graph transformation focused on the degree distribution @xmath8 and applied to the metabolic network can be found in @xcite . in that work , similarities and differences between the line graph transformation and the metabolic network are discussed .",
    "there it was found that if the initial network follows a power - law @xmath4 , the transformed network preserves the scale - free topology and in most cases the exponent is increased by one unit as @xmath9 .",
    "the observed topological properties related to the clustering degree of the metabolic network ( in particular , the chemical compound network ) have been properly described by means of the rsmob model . in the present work",
    ", our aim is to study the clustering coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath6 of the reaction network by using two approaches : firstly , we derive mathematical equations of those coefficients in the transformed network .",
    "secondly , we apply the line graph transformation to a hierarchical network .",
    "the results from both methods are compared with experimental data of reactions from kegg database @xcite showing a good agreement . though we started this work motivated by theoretical interest in the line graph transformation ,",
    "the results provide explanation for the difference of @xmath0 between the compound network and the reaction network .    in our work ,",
    "the hierarchical network is generated by the rsmob model , where the nodes correspond to chemical compounds and the edges correspond to reactions . while the rsmob model reproduces successfully the hierarchical properties of the compound network , here we show that this hierarchical model also stores adequate information to reproduce the experimental data of the reaction network .",
    "our study indicates that it is enough to apply the line graph transformation to the hierarchical network to extract that information .",
    "while @xmath0 follows the power - law @xmath10 for the initial hierarchical network ( compound network ) , @xmath0 scales weakly as @xmath3 for the transformed network ( reaction network ) .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the reaction network can not be defined as a hierarchical network .",
    "it is also worth noting that the line graph transformation has recently been applied with success on the protein interaction network @xcite with the aim to detect functional modules . in that work ,",
    "the edges ( interactions ) between two proteins become the nodes of the transformed network ( interaction network ) . by means of the line graph transformation ,",
    "the interaction network has its structure level more increased than that from the protein network ( i.e. , higher clustering coefficient ) . by using the tribemcl algorithm",
    "@xcite they are able to detect clusters in the more highly clustered interaction network .",
    "these clusters are transformed back to the initial protein - protein network to identify which proteins conform functional clusters . at this point , we note that the aim of our study is not to detect functional modules from the metabolic network . in our work",
    "the line graph transformation is used successfully to evoke topological properties related to the clustering degree of the reaction network .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the theoretical concepts in our approach , and explain the mathematical methods used in our analysis . in sec .",
    "iii we present the experimental data of metabolic pathways of the kegg database for @xmath0 and @xmath6 , and we compare with our theoretical predictions before and after the line graph transformation is done .",
    "the final section summarizes our work .",
    "recent analyses have demonstrated that the metabolic network has a hierarchical organization , with properties as : scale - free degree distribution @xmath4 , power - law dependence of clustering coefficient @xmath7 and independence with network size of the average clustering coefficient @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is the total number of nodes in a network @xcite .",
    "the clustering coefficient can be defined for each node @xmath11 as :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 denotes the number of edges connecting the @xmath14 nearest neighbors of node @xmath11 to each other .",
    "@xmath15 is equal to 1 for a node at the center of a fully interlinked cluster , and it is 0 for a node that is a part of a loosely connected cluster @xcite .",
    "an example can be seen in fig .",
    "geometrically , @xmath13 gives the number of triangles that go through node @xmath11 .",
    "the factor @xmath16 gives the total number of triangles that could go through node @xmath11 ( i.e. , total number of triangles obtained when all the neighbors of node @xmath11 are connected to each other ) . in the case of fig .",
    "1(a ) , there is one triangle that contains node 1 ( dash - dotted lines ) , and a total of 6 triangles could be generated as the maximum .",
    "hence , the clustering coefficient of node 1 is @xmath17 = 1/6 .    on the other hand",
    ", the average clustering coefficient @xmath6 characterizes the overall tendency of nodes to form clusters as a function of the total size of the network @xmath5 .",
    "the mathematical expression is :    @xmath18    the structure of the network is given by the function @xmath0 , which is defined as the average clustering coefficient over nodes with the same node degree @xmath1 .",
    "this function is written as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the number of nodes with degree @xmath1 , and the sum runs over the @xmath20 nodes with degree @xmath1 .",
    "a scaling law @xmath21 for this magnitude is an indication of the hierarchical topology of a network .",
    "once the theoretical definitions have been introduced , our aim is to analyse how the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath0 are modified under the line graph transformation .      given an undirected graph @xmath22 , defined by a set of nodes @xmath23 and a set of edges @xmath24 , we associate another graph @xmath25 , called the line graph of @xmath22 , in which @xmath26 , and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they have a common endpoint in @xmath22 ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) . this construction of graph @xmath25 from the initial graph @xmath22 is called line graph transformation @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in a previous work @xcite the degree distribution @xmath8 was studied by applying line graph transformation to synthetic and real networks .",
    "there it is assumed an initial graph @xmath22 with scale - free topology as @xmath28 . as the degree of",
    "each transformed node ( i.e. , an edge in @xmath22 ) will be roughly around @xmath1 , the distribution of the line graph @xmath25 should be @xmath29 = @xmath30 with degree around @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that if we have a graph @xmath22 with a probability distribution following a power - law as @xmath31 , then @xmath25 will follow a power - law as @xmath30 .",
    "the real networks under study were protein - protein interaction , _ www _ , and metabolic networks . in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we can see an example of the line graph transformation applied to a subgraph of the metabolic network .    however , it is important to point out one issue . in metabolic networks ,",
    "there are cases where spurious nodes appear . for example , we consider two reactions sharing the same substrate ( or product ) and at least one of the chemical reaction has more than one product ( or substrate ) . if we apply a line graph transformation to this network , we would obtain more than two nodes in the transformed network , where only two nodes ( reflecting two reactions present in the real process ) should appear .",
    "these spurious nodes appear only when one ( or some ) reaction(s ) in the network has more than one product ( or substrate ) .",
    "therefore , these cases should be computed and transformed by generating only as many nodes in the transformed network as reactions in the real metabolic process .",
    "this procedure is called @xmath32 line graph transformation . in the present work",
    ", we have applied this procedure to generate the reaction network by using experimental data from the kegg database .",
    "experimental data @xcite are shown later in figs . 6 and 7 ( blue diamonds ) .",
    "more detailed information about this issue can be found in @xcite .",
    "we assume a graph @xmath22 as it is depicted in fig .",
    "2(a ) . in this graph , edge",
    "@xmath33 connects two nodes with degree @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we apply the line graph transformation to this graph @xmath22 and the result of this transformation is the line graph of @xmath22 , @xmath25 shown in fig .",
    "we see that , under the line graph transformation , the nodes of @xmath25 are the edges of @xmath22 , with two nodes of @xmath25 adjacent whenever the corresponding edges of @xmath22 are",
    ".    the clustering coefficient for the node @xmath33 in the transformed network can be written by using eq .",
    "( 1 ) as : @xmath36}{(k^\\prime-1 + k^{\\prime\\prime}-1 ) ( k^\\prime -1 + k^{\\prime\\prime } - 1 - 1)},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , because the edge @xmath33 vanishes in the graph @xmath25 .",
    "this equation ignores cases where edges in the graph @xmath22 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for example , have a common node as endpoint ( i.e. , existence of triangles or _ loops _ in fig .",
    "2(c ) ) . however , we can quantify these cases by using a new parameter @xmath40 . as we can see in fig .",
    "2(c)-(d ) , edges with one common node as endpoint in the graph @xmath22 means one additional edge in the graph @xmath25 .",
    "this additional edge in @xmath25 connects two neighbors of node @xmath33 . by following definition of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , it means that @xmath41 increases its value by one unit .",
    "we can consider these cases by increasing one unit the parameter @xmath40 for each common node as endpoint of two edges in the graph @xmath22 ( for example , @xmath42 means one common node ) .",
    "we write eq .",
    "( 4 ) after introducing the parameter @xmath40 as @xcite :    @xmath43}{(k^\\prime-1 + k^{\\prime\\prime}-1 ) ( k^\\prime -1 + k^{\\prime\\prime } - 1 - 1)},\\ ] ]    where if @xmath44 means that there are not _ loops _ and we recover eq .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath40 always contributes to increasing the value of @xmath45 and @xmath46 always holds from the definition . in order to study the limits of eq .",
    "( 5 ) we consider the following two cases :    * @xmath47 @xmath34=@xmath35 : we analyse the case where both degrees have the same value .",
    "we also consider the cases when @xmath44 and @xmath48 in order to study the effect of triangles .",
    "we show the results in fig .",
    "3 . for large @xmath34 ,",
    "eq . ( 5 ) goes asymptotically to @xmath49 for @xmath44 and @xmath48 .",
    "we also see that for @xmath50 , all lines are very close to @xmath49 . for low @xmath34 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 takes values from 0.33 ( @xmath34 =3 ) to 0.48 ( @xmath34 = 20 ) .",
    "hence , we see in fig .",
    "3 that higher values of @xmath40 ( more triangles ) increase the values of @xmath45 .",
    "* @xmath51 @xmath52 , @xmath53 : we plot in fig . 4 three cases . @xmath35 is fixed with constant values as @xmath54 ( black ) , @xmath55 ( red ) , @xmath56 ( blue ) and @xmath34 is a free parameter .",
    "we see that @xmath45 approaches to 1 when @xmath34 takes large values . for low @xmath34",
    ", the case @xmath35 = 5 shows a minimum with a few values of @xmath34 below 1/2 . as we can see with dotted and dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "4 , the presence of triangles ( @xmath48 ) increases the value of @xmath45 .",
    "finally , for @xmath35 = 10 and @xmath35 = 20 , we see that only a few values of @xmath45 are slightly below 1/2 for low @xmath34 .",
    "this analysis is complemented by calculating the minimun value of @xmath45 analitically as : @xmath57 the value of @xmath58 , where the function @xmath45 takes the minimum value , is given by @xcite : @xmath59 + by substituting this equation into eq .",
    "( 5 ) , it is possible to calculate the minimum value of @xmath45 for each configuration of @xmath40 and @xmath35 .    from these two cases , we can conclude that for hubs ( i.e. , those nodes with high degree ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath60 ) ) and for highly clustered networks ( many triangles @xmath61 ) , the values of @xmath45 in the transformed network are between around [ @xmath62 .    to calculate the distribution of @xmath0 in the transformed space @xmath63 we introduce the concept of assortativity . by assortative ( disassortative ) mixing in networks we understand the preference for nodes with high degree to connect to other high ( low ) degree nodes @xcite . by following _",
    "@xcite , we define the probability distribution to choose a randomly edge with two nodes at either end with degrees @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath64 .",
    "we also assume that the nodes of the initial network are following a power - law distribution @xmath31 and have no assortative mixing . under these assumptions ,",
    "the probability distribution @xmath64 of edges that link together nodes with degree @xmath65 can be written as :    @xmath66    we make a convolution between eq .",
    "( 4 ) and eq . ( 7 ) , by summing for all the possible degrees of the two nodes at either end of edges ( @xmath67 , which can generate transformed nodes with degree @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we obtain :    @xmath68    according to the structure of @xmath69 and the behavior of @xmath45 exposed above , @xmath69 will grow smoothly for large @xmath1 , i.e. , scaling weakly with the node degree @xmath1 .",
    "we have calculated numerically this expression and the results are discussed later in fig .",
    "we have also calculated the analytical expression for @xmath6 , and we have found that @xmath6 has a size - independent behavior before and after the line graph transformation is done . we can write the number of nodes with degree @xmath1 as : @xmath70 and we assume that @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a constant .",
    "this constant changes when we consider hierarchical networks with different number of nodes in the initial cluster @xcite .",
    "but it seems natural because in that case the degree distribution @xmath4 of the network also changes . for @xmath6 before the transformation we can write @xcite : @xmath73 furthermore , if we use the rsmob model ( explained in next section ) , eq .",
    "( 10 ) takes the form :    @xmath74^{-\\gamma^{\\prime}}[(m-1)^{-\\alpha}]}{[(m-1)^j]^{-\\gamma^{\\prime}}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath75 is the number of iterations , @xmath76 is the number of nodes in the initial fully connected cluster and @xmath77 is a constant adjusted so that @xmath6=1 holds for @xmath78 .",
    "the upper limit of the summation @xmath79 is obtained by means of the expression @xmath80 , which gives the total number of nodes in the network and @xmath81 = @xmath82 denotes the exponent of the power - law distribution of hubs in the rsmob model @xcite .",
    "the approximately equal symbol indicates that eq . (",
    "11 ) is valid for hub nodes , and non - hub nodes are not considered .    by using these equations",
    ", we will see later ( tables 1 and 2 ) that @xmath6 converges to a constant . in order to calculate @xmath6 after the line graph transformation is applied ( @xmath83 )",
    ", we make the substitution @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) . as from eq .",
    "( 8) we have seen that @xmath69 is almost constant , we can conclude that @xmath83 also has a constant behavior and it is almost independent with network size .",
    "while the scaling law of @xmath7 was proved mathematically in @xcite , here we have obtained the analytical expressions of @xmath69 , @xmath6 and @xmath83 .",
    "the rsmob model @xcite is able to reproduce the main topological features of the metabolic network .",
    "we follow the method described in @xcite and generate a hierarchical network .",
    "then , we apply the line graph transformation to that network .",
    "5 illustrates the hierarchical network generated by the rsmob model .",
    "the network is made of densely linked 5-node modules ( it is worth noticing that the number of nodes in the initial module can be different than 5 ) that are assembled into larger 25-node modules ( iteration n=1 , @xmath85 nodes ) . in the next step four",
    "replicas are created and the peripheral nodes are connected again to produce 125-node modules ( iteration n=2 , @xmath86 nodes ) .",
    "this process can be repeated indefinitely @xcite .",
    "to evaluate @xmath0 , we have constructed three hierarchical networks with 3 , 4 , and 5 initial number of nodes .",
    "these networks were generated up to 7 ( 6561 ) , 5 ( 4096 ) , and 4 ( 3125 ) iterations ( nodes ) , repectively .",
    "once we have constructed these three networks , we apply the line graph transformation to them , and we calculate the @xmath69 clustering coefficient for the transformed networks . in fig .",
    "6(a ) we show the results of the clustering coefficient of the transformed network .",
    "circles , triangles and squares indicate the values of @xmath0 for the transformed network with 3 , 4 , and 5 initial nodes , respectively . in fig .",
    "6(a ) we also plot with continuous lines the values of @xmath69 obtained from eq .",
    "( 8) . from top",
    "to bottom the lines correspond to the networks of 3 , 4 and 5 initial nodes , respectively . in fig .",
    "6(a ) , we see that the lines show an acceptable agreement with the overall tendency of data generated by the transformed network . in fig .",
    "6(b ) , we see that the results from theoretical calculation of @xmath69 via eq .",
    "( 8) ( lines ) are in good agreement with the experimental data ( diamonds ) from the kegg database @xcite .",
    "the only disagreement comes at @xmath87 .",
    "this is easy to understand because in the hierarchical model depicted in fig . 5",
    ", we can only find @xmath88 for 3 initial nodes by construction of the network .",
    "however , in real networks , we could find nodes which have only two neighbors and , in some cases , these neighbors could be connected . in these cases",
    "the clustering coefficient takes value one .    in fig .",
    "7 , we show the results for @xmath0 after the line graph transformation is applied to the hierarchical network generated by 4 initial nodes and up to 5 iterations .",
    "the results are shown with empty triangles ( red ) and fitted to the dashed line .",
    "we see that @xmath2 changed into @xmath89 .",
    "we also see that the line graph transformation increases the average of the clustering value of the transformed network .",
    "these theoretical results were compared with the experimental data from kegg @xcite , finding a good agreement , and supporting the result of a degree - independent clustering coefficient @xmath69 for the reaction network .    for @xmath6 we have evaluated eq .",
    "( 10 ) for 3 different configurations .",
    "we have considered 3 initial nodes , 4 and 5 initial nodes nodes up to 7 , 5 and 4 iterations , respectively . as it is explained in @xcite",
    ", @xmath6 approaches asymptotically to a constant value , being independent of the size of the network .",
    "the asymptotic value depends on the initial number of nodes .",
    "we calculated the values of @xmath90 corresponding to the degree distrution @xmath4 for each network , and the related constant @xmath72 , which appears in eq .",
    "we show in table 1 the values of these parameters and the results of @xmath6 obtained by eq .",
    "these values , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "8(a ) , are below the asymptotic values of @xmath91 ( circles ) and @xmath92 ( triangles ) obtained by using the rsmob model .",
    "however , we have found an explanation for this result . in fig .",
    "7 , the full circles at the top of the dash - dotted line correspond to non - hubs nodes .",
    "we have checked that these nodes do not follow a power - law , hence the value of @xmath0 is being overestimated by the scaling dependence @xmath21 and it provides a larger value of @xmath6 . in @xcite ,",
    "the values of @xmath6 from hierarchical model were compared with the experimental values of 43 organisms .",
    "the values of @xmath6 for each organism were around 0.15 - 0.25 . by using the kegg database",
    "we have evaluated the experimental value @xmath6 for 163 organisms and we obtained an average value of 0.08 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "8(a ) the values of @xmath6 calculated for networks generated by 3 initial nodes ( circles ) and 4 initial nodes ( triangles ) by using the rsmob model .",
    "we see that @xmath6 approaches asymptotically to constant values around @xmath91 ( circles ) and @xmath92 ( triangles ) , being independent of the size of the network .",
    "once the line graph transformation is applied , we see that the corresponding values of @xmath83 also approach asymptotically to constant values .",
    "hence , @xmath83 also is size - independent for large @xmath5 ( empty circles and triangles ) .",
    "in addition , we have averaged the experimental value of the clustering coefficient for reactions of 163 organisms found in kegg database and we have obtained the value of @xmath83=0.74 .",
    "we see that the experimental value @xmath83 for reactions is in good agreement with the asymptotic values obtained by the transformed network ( empty triangles and circles ) .",
    "furthemore , we have also calculated @xmath6 by using eq . ( 11 ) .",
    "this equation should reproduce the results of @xmath6 calculated by using the rsmob model ( dark circles and triangles in fig .",
    "8(a ) ) . in fig .",
    "8(b ) , we see that the results are qualitively similar to those shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) ( dark circles and triangles ) .",
    "we remark that the theoretical analysis of @xmath6 and @xmath83 done here has also been useful to prove that they are independent of network size .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at the end of this section , it is convenient to summarize our findings in table 3 .",
    "we can see in table 3 , with @xmath93 and @xmath94 symbols , the functions studied analytically and evaluated by us .",
    "we see that central properties of networks were studied by using the line graph transformation technique , which suggests the effectiveness of the method .",
    "we have studied here the clustering coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath6 of the reaction network by applying the line graph transformation to a hierarchical network .",
    "this hierarchical network was generated by using the rsmob model , which reproduces properly the topological features of the metabolic network , in particular the compound network .",
    "our results indicate that by applying the line graph transformation to the hierarchical network , it is possible to extract topological properties of the reaction network , which is embedded in the metabolic network .",
    "the rsmob model stores the adequate information of the reaction network and the line graph transformation is one useful technique to evoke it .",
    "while @xmath0 scales as @xmath10 for the initial hierarchical network ( compound network ) , we find @xmath95 for the transformed network ( reaction network ) . this theoretical prediction was compared with the experimental data from the kegg database , finding a good agreement .",
    "our results indicate that the reaction network is a degree - independent clustering network .",
    "furthermore , the weak scaling of @xmath0 for the reaction network suggests us that this network has not hierarchical organization .",
    "on the other hand , we have also conducted an analytical derivation for the clustering coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "expressions for these coefficients were calculated before and after the line graph transformation is applied to the hierarchical network . the agreement obtained by using these expressions was found acceptable , and consequently , they could be useful for further analyses .",
    "the line graph transformation has recently been applied on metabolic networks @xcite to study the scale - free topology of the reaction network , and on the protein - protein interaction network to detect functional clusters @xcite .",
    "the work done here is another important application of this interesting technique .",
    "though it is more realistic to consider the parameter @xmath40 as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath96 , we have considered @xmath40 as an independent parameter . however , this simplification does not affect the qualitative features of our results .",
    "we must notice that in a hierarchical network , the number of nodes with different degree @xmath1 is scarce , therefore the probability distribution of node degree is properly defined as @xmath8=@xmath98 , where @xmath20 is the number of nodes with degree @xmath1 , @xmath99 is the total number of nodes , and @xmath100 means that nodes with degree @xmath1 are binned into intervals .",
    "in addition , we note that for the hierarchical model , @xmath100 changes linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the exponent of the power - law is given by @xmath101 , with @xmath102 where @xmath76 is the number of nodes in the initial module .",
