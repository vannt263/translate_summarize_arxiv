    "it is necessary to clarify the dependence of the magnetoresistive characteristics on the stoichiometry of the heusler film electrode and its impact on the selection of materials for tmr devices .",

    "furthermore , partially substitution of one of the elements in the ternary heusler @xmath5 ( where , @xmath6 is transition metals and @xmath7 main group element ) can be used to design new materials with predictable properties  @xcite , such as tuning the fermi energy in to the middle of the minority band gap  @xcite .",

    "this compound is of interest for spintronic applications because it combines high curie temperature ( 905  k )  @xcite , high magnetic moment ( 5  @xmath15 )  @xcite , and coherent growth on top of semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "the non - stoichiometric co@xmath0mnge was successfully used to produce magnetic tunnel junctions  @xcite .",

    "they achieved a significant increase of the tmr up to 160% at rt ( 376% at 4.2  k ) by annealing at 500@xmath16c  @xcite .",
    "this increase was explained in terms of the increase in the interfacial spin polarization at the fermi level associated with the change in the spin - dependent interfacial density of states . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of defects in co@xmath0mn@xmath17ge@xmath18 and co@xmath0mn@xmath19si films on the tmr ratio was extensively studied in reference  @xcite where a strong dependence on the composition and mn content was observed . a high tmr ratio of 650% at 4.2  k and 220% at rt for co@xmath0mn@xmath17ge@xmath18 with @xmath20= 1.40",
