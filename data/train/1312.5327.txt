    "for precision studies at colliders , such as the extraction of the strong coupling constant @xmath2 from measurements of event shapes , it is important to control non - perturbative effects . while power suppressed , they can be relevant because the suppression scale is often not the center - of - mass scale @xmath3 of the collision , but the smallest perturbative scale in the problem . for thrust @xmath4 , for example , non",
    "- perturbative effects are only suppressed by the soft scale @xmath5 , which is significantly smaller than @xmath3 in the two - jet region where the extraction of @xmath2 is performed . in the region",
    "@xmath6 , the leading non - perturbative effect is a shift @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a non - perturbative matrix element defined below .",
    "lee and sterman were able to show that the same matrix element @xmath9 also provides the leading non - perturbative effect in other event - shape variables @xcite .",
    "they considered the angularities @xcite @xmath10 where the rapidity @xmath11 and transverse momentum are defined relative to the thrust axis , and found that the non - perturbative shift for these variables is the same as in the case of thrust , except for the prefactor , which equals @xmath12 .",
    "this relation was obtained earlier from a dispersive model for power corrections @xcite , but in @xcite it was derived in qcd . for @xmath13 the angularity is equal to the thrust @xmath14 , and for @xmath15 it is twice the total broadening @xmath16 . however , the analysis of @xcite is only valid for @xmath17 . in the limit @xmath18 , the factorization theorem @xcite on which their analysis is based is no longer valid and",
    "the shift @xmath19 diverges .",
    "the factorization of event shapes in the two - jet limit can be derived using soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "there has recently been a lot of progress in analyzing transverse - momentum - dependent observables in scet . in particular , a factorization theorem for jet broadening was established in @xcite , which differs from the one relevant for thrust in several important aspects .",
    "these differences arise because for jet broadening , the transverse momentum of the soft and jet radiation is of same size .",
    "in contrast , for thrust , or more general angularities with @xmath17 , the transverse momentum of the soft radiation is parametrically smaller than that of the collinear radiation .",
    "for this reason soft recoil effects are power suppressed and the leading non - perturbative effects arise in the soft function . for broadening , on the other hand , there is a nontrivial interplay between the soft and jet functions and the leading non - perturbative effects affect both .",
    "since the characteristic scale of the soft and jet radiation is the same , the splitting among the two contributions is no longer unique for transverse observables such as jet broadening .",
    "one could introduce rapidity cutoffs to separate the different contributions , but it is more convenient to use analytic regulators .",
    "the soft and collinear functions then suffer from rapidity divergences which are not regularized by dimensional regularization .",
    "we have shown that these divergences only affect phase - space integrals and can be regularized using @xcite @xmath20 with @xmath21 . here , @xmath22 and its conjugate vector @xmath23 are two light - cone reference vectors pointing in the direction of large momentum flow .",
    "the regulator @xmath24 is introduced on the phase space of each particle in the final state . for the current analysis",
    ", it will be convenient to replace @xmath25 for an @xmath26-particle final state in order to have homogeneous scaling for all phase - space integrals .",
    "the soft and jet functions then suffer from divergences in the analytic regulator which cancel in their product .    from consistency considerations",
    "@xcite , one can show that the cancellation of the rapidity divergences induces a logarithmic dependence on the hard scale @xmath3 in the low - energy matrix element , an effect called collinear anomaly @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , the product of the soft and jet functions takes the form @xmath27 where the anomaly exponent @xmath28 and remainder @xmath29 are independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence is a pure power , and the result resums this dependence as long as the scale @xmath30 is chosen to be of the order of the transverse momentum .    from the structure of one",
    "suspects that the dominant non - perturbative effects to transverse observables are corrections to the anomaly exponent @xmath28 . by performing an operator product expansion of the soft function and using consistency relations ,",
    "we show that this logarithmic enhancement of non - perturbative effects is indeed present . for the case of jet broadening",
    ", we furthermore show that the leading non - perturbative corrections are determined by the same matrix element that governs the non - perturbative correction to thrust .",
    "the soft function which occurs in the factorization theorem for broadening has the form @xcite @xmath31 where the quantities @xmath32 sum the transverse momenta of the particles in the left and right hemispheres with respect to the thrust axis .",
    "the subscript `` reg '' on the sum over intermediate states indicates that we have regularized this sum according to .",
    "the soft emissions are described by two wilson lines along the directions of the two jets .",
    "the soft function involves four @xmath33-functions .",
    "the first two set the values of the broadenings @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the latter two ensure that the transverse momentum of the soft radiation balances the one of the collinear radiation in each hemisphere .",
    "we now expand the soft function around the limit of large @xmath36 . up to first order in the expansion ,",
    "we obtain @xmath37     & \\;\\times \\big [   \\delta(b_l ) \\delta(b_r)- \\mathcal{m}_l",

    "the matrix element multiplying the first term in is trivial , since one sums over the final states without a constraint and the wilson lines cancel by unitarity ( after the analytic regulator is sent to zero ) .",
    "note also , that the power corrections from the expansion in the transverse momenta @xmath39 must be second order because of rotation invariance in the transverse plane .    to analyze the matrix elements @xmath40 , we follow lee and sterman @xcite and",
    "rewrite them in terms of the transverse energy - flow operator , @xmath41 where we used the convention that left - moving particles with @xmath42 have positive rapidity @xmath11 .",
    "the energy - flow operator @xmath43 is defined by its action on states @xmath44 , @xmath45 we next perform a lorentz boost along the thrust axis with rapidity @xmath46 .",
    "the wilson lines are boost - invariant , but the presence of the analytic regulator in spoils the invariance of the phase - space integrals . as a consequence ,",
    "the sum over states picks up @xmath26 factors @xmath47 , while the energy - flow operator transforms to @xmath48 . by choosing @xmath49 ,",
    "the matrix element becomes independent of @xmath11 and the rapidity integration can be explicitly carried out .",
    "expanding in the analytic regulator and performing the sum over final states , we end up with @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the same matrix element that drives the non - perturbative shift of the thrust distribution , see .",
    "this is precisely the result which lee and sterman obtained when studying the angularities , but in our case @xmath24 is a regulator , which is present in both the soft and the jet functions .",
    "since qcd does not need the additional regulator to be well - defined , the pole in @xmath24 must cancel against a divergence in the leading non - perturbative correction to the jet functions .    to study this cancellation",
    ", we work in laplace space , @xmath52 where the cross section factors into a product @xmath53          & \\quad\\times\\overline{\\cal j}_{\\!l}(\\tau_l , z_l)\\;\\overline{\\cal j}_{\\!r}(\\tau_r , z_r)\\ ;      \\overline{\\cal s}(\\tau_l , \\tau_r , z_l , z_r ) .",

    "the single - pole structure is manifest in , but consistency requires it to be present for all anomalous observables . as a consequence ,",
    "the leading power corrections are always enhanced by a single logarithm of @xmath3 .",
    "after the cancellation , the product @xmath63 becomes @xmath64 up to additional first - order power corrections which are not logarithmically enhanced . at higher orders ,",
    "the cancellation of rapidity divergences implies that the logarithmic terms exponentiate , and the result takes a similar structure as the perturbative expression , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the anomaly exponent and @xmath67 the remainder function .",
    "we can thus view the enhanced power correction as a non - perturbative correction to @xmath66 .",
    "momentum modes for jet broadening .",
    "the virtuality of the perturbative modes on the upper hyperbola scales as @xmath68 , whereas @xmath69 for the non - perturbative modes on the lower one .",
    "note that perturbative and non - perturbative modes of the same type have the same rapidity , which implies the scalings @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    to go back from laplace to momentum space , we choose @xmath73 and rewrite @xmath74 up to power - suppressed terms which are not enhanced by logarithms of @xmath3 . performing the inverse laplace transform ,",
    "we find that the power correction produces a shift of the distribution proportional to @xmath75 @xmath76 & \\quad=   \\frac{d^2\\sigma^{\\rm pert}}{db_ldb_r}\\left(b_l- \\frac{\\mathcal{a}}{2 } \\ln \\frac{q}{b_l } , b_r- \\frac{\\mathcal{a}}{2 } \\ln \\frac{q}{b_r}\\right)+ \\dots \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the total and wide broadenings , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , it follows that the distributions get shifted by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of @xcite , in which the same effect was derived within the framework of the dispersive model .",
    "what our discussion adds is that it extends the qcd analysis of @xcite to the case of the broadenings and shows that the result is model independent . what does not follow from our analysis ,",
    "is that the same non - perturbative parameter @xmath81 also governs the part of the power corrections which are not enhanced by logarithms of @xmath3 .",
    "analyzing the non - logarithmic part would require an understanding of the structure of power corrections to the jet functions .",
    "we note that the universality established here holds for the definition , but can be broken by hadron mass effects for alternative definitions @xcite .",
    "this happens , for example , if the angularities are defined using pseudorapidity instead of rapidity .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     the mechanism discussed above is at play in all observables which are affected by a collinear anomaly .",
    "important examples include the spectra of electroweak bosons at low transverse momentum .",
    "the differential cross section for the scattering of hadrons @xmath82 and @xmath83 into a weak boson of mass @xmath84 with rapidity @xmath11 and transverse momentum @xmath85 has the form @xcite @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the sum runs over quark and anti - quark flavors for vector bosons , while @xmath88 for higgs production .",
    "the @xmath89-dependence of the transverse parton distribution functions @xmath90 as well as the anomaly exponent @xmath91 can be computed perturbatively .",
    "typically , non - perturbative effects are modelled by cutting off the integration over the transverse separation with a gaussian , i.e.  by replacing @xmath92 however , our analysis of jet broadening makes it clear that the leading non - perturbative effects are due to a modification of the anomaly exponent @xmath93 where @xmath94 can be extracted from the matrix element @xmath95 which implies that the correction only depends on the color representation , but not on the flavor , of @xmath96 and @xmath97  , see . to work with a non - vanishing soft function",
    "one can use a symmetric form of the regulator in which the soft function is present , or split the radiation into hemispheres , see @xcite . ] .",
    "the power correction is of second order for the transverse momentum spectrum , while it is of first order for the broadening .",
    "however , other important aspects are the same for both observables .",
    "as explained after , the relevant soft and collinear matrix elements can only have a single pole in the analytic regulator and the leading power correction is therefore enhanced only by a single logarithm of the hard scale @xmath84 .",
    "this enhancement was predicted already in @xcite on the basis of a model describing the emission of particles with low invariant mass at high rapidity . in this model ,",
    "the scale in the logarithm is set by a non - perturbative parameter @xmath98 instead of the transverse separation @xmath99 which governs the anomaly .",
    "we stress that the leading , logarithmically - enhanced terms exponentiate .",
    "this is important , since a strict twist expansion is worse than factorially divergent @xcite . in figure",
    "[ qtnp ] , we compare the gaussian cutoff to the enhanced non - perturbative effects from the collinear anomaly .",
    "we find that the effects are quite similar if the value of @xmath100 is adjusted so that it will be difficult to distinguish the shapes with current data .",
    "however , in contrast to the ad - hoc models that are traditionally used , our analysis predicts the form of the power correction as well as its properties .    the mechanism described in this letter is universal and applies to all observables that are affected by a collinear anomaly .",
    "our results provide a model - independent treatment of non - perturbative effects which is important for precision studies , both at lepton and hadron colliders .    _",
