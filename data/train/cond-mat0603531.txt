    "this review is about the transfer of energy between electrons and nuclei .",
    "we focus especially on the theories and computer models that can be used to describe this process .",
    "energy transfer is such a general concept , however , that we need to specify what exactly we have in mind here .",
    "a possible sequence of events that illustrates the kind of processes we have in mind is :    1 .",
    "a system begins in equilibrium .",
    "is then subjected to some external influence .",
    "this might be an electromagnetic pulse that transfers energy to the electrons thousands of times more efficiently than to the nuclei , thus giving the electrons a relatively higher energy . or , at the other extreme , it might be a flux of neutrons which interact only with the nuclei which would have the effect of raising the energy of the nuclei relative to the electrons .",
    "( it could also be a number of other things , such as a beam of electrons or a flux of heat . )",
    "3 .   as a result of this departure from equilibrium",
    ", there will be a net flow of energy either from the electrons to the nuclei , or from the nuclei to the electrons , as the system moves back towards equilibrium .",
    "the final transfer of energy is made possible by interactions that couple the electrons to the nuclei .",
    "of course these same interactions lead to other forms of correlated motion between electrons and nuclei , such as the modification of the electronic band structure , the effective coupling between electrons that produces superconductivity , and the coherent transport of electrons by virtual polarons .",
    "interesting though they are they are not covered here .",
    "this review is structured as follows . in the next section we briefly summarise some relevant phenomenology .",
    "we then describe the most important methods currently available for modelling these phenomena .",
    "finally we briefly consider the future of the theories .",
    "in this section we survey some phenomena observed in solids that are produced by the irreversible flow of energy between electrons and nuclei . _ _ _ _ in what follows , neither the range of phenomena nor the list of citations are exhaustive .",
    "instead we have merely attempted to provide a basis for thought and analysis for the interested reader .",
    "probably the most familiar and easiest to observe phenomenon involving the inelastic transfer of energy between electrons and nuclei is the increase in temperature of an electrical conductor when a current passes through it .",
    "the idea that electric currents do work on conductors , and so cause heating , has been known since the mid nineteenth century when it was investigated by james joule@xcite .",
    "the treatment of transport in terms of boltzmann s equation has been brought to a high level@xcite , with the coupling between the electrons and phonons treated perturbatively .",
    "this is accurate for macroscopic materials because no coupling to any one vibrational mode is large .",
    "with the rise in interest in mesoscale and nanoscale systems additional quantum effects became apparent , introduced by the small length scales .",
    "one such system is the atomic scale contact , which can be produced either by a break junction or a scanning tunnelling microscope .",
    "when a current is passed through the junction heating takes place that increases with applied voltage . experimental evidence for",
    "this heating comes from observations of the voltage dependence of two level fluctuations and hysteresis at conductance discontinuities in atomic scale contacts@xcite and from measurements on current induced rupture of atomic chains@xcite .",
    "this heating , which can be very substantial , may at first seem mysterious since the electron mean free path is so much greater than an atomic spacing .",
    "however this net heating is simply a compromise between the small probability for an individual electron to scatter off a phonon in an atomic wire , and the huge density of current carrying electrons that accompanies the current densities attainable in quasi - ballistic metallic nanoconductors@xcite .",
    "this can result in the apparent paradox of a hot conductor that is still largely ballistic , and thus resistance free , as far as individual electrons coming through are concerned .",
    "the transfer of energy is not the only important consequence of the non - adiabatic interactions between electrons and nuclei .",
    "for example , non - radiative processes in semiconductors contribute to trapping of free carriers which has an impact on the conductivity and optical properties@xcite .",
    "because the binding energy of deep centres can be much larger than typical phonon energies , the phonons can participate in the optical transitions ( which provide the most direct information about the defect electronic properties ) .",
    "thus non - radiative processes can be observed in optical absorption spectra of lattice defects@xcite .",
    "paramagnetic ions in insulators can undergo spin reversal@xcite ( the ions switch between zeeman levels ) .",
    "initially an electromagnetic field is applied .",
    "this takes the population away from equilibrium .",
    "the system can then return to equilibrium through interaction with thermal phonons@xcite , a process that can be observed by spin resonance experiments@xcite .",
    "there is intense interest at present in similar phenomena in nanoscale systems such as quantum dots , as the quantum confinement produces discrete electronic states which modify the relaxation rates of electrons and holes@xcite    excitons can be thought of as a bound pair of particles : a negatively charged electron and a positively charged hole .",
    "excitons can further interact with each other and form pairs@xcite , or bind to defects@xcite . however , since the hole is simply the absence of an electron , with the positive charge originating with the nuclei , it is possible for the two quasi - particles to combine and annihilate with the release of energy .",
    "this energy can escape as a photon or one or more phonons . in semiconductors",
    "a phonon may be essential to the recombination process because of crystal momentum conservation , though the presence of defects that trap excitons can remove this constraint@xcite .",
    "the angular momentum state of the exciton can frustrate its radiative decay@xcite , which is important for the efficiency of organic light - emitting diodes .",
    "a simple counting argument suggests roughly a quarter of excitons are in a singlet state ( and can undergo radiative decay ) while the remaining three quarters are in a triplet state ( and can not undergo radiative decay ) .",
    "however , there appear to be significant exceptions to this rule@xcite .",
    "excitons in quantum wells have increased binding energy because of their confinement , though their interaction with phonons appears unaffected@xcite . in multiple quantum",
    "well structures , excitons can become trapped at a number of sites with different energies .",
    "phonons assist in the migration at low temperatures ( making up the difference in energies between binding sites ) , and at higher temperatures ( @xmath010k ) produce thermally activated migration@xcite .",
    "inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy exploits the transfer of energy between electrons and nuclei to probe the vibrational spectrum of molecules by passing an electric current through them .",
    "a schematic of the experimental arrangement is shown in figure [ fig : iets01 ] .",
    "there are two metallic plates ( or contacts ) across which a bias is applied ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the applied voltage and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the chemical potentials of the left and right plates respectively , as shown in figure [ fig : iets01 ] ) . between the plates is an insulating region ( often an oxide ) that contains the molecules whose vibrational frequencies we wish to probe . in general there will be an elastic tunnelling current ( an electron arrives at the right plate with the same energy that it had when it departed the left plate ) whose magnitude increases linearly with the applied voltage for low voltages . at low temperatures , and for sufficiently large applied voltage ( @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the angular frequency for the vibrational mode with lowest frequency that can exchange energy with an electron ) , a conduction channel will open up in which an electron can arrive at the right hand plate and enter an empty state with a diminished energy , the energy lost being equal to one quantum of vibrational energy for the molecules in the sample . by increasing the voltage ,",
    "additional channels open up corresponding to higher vibrational frequencies , or possibly multi - phonon processes . at higher temperatures it is possible for the electron to gain energy from the molecular oscillations .",
    "lambe and jaklevic@xcite present a theory based on fermi s golden rule ( see section [ sub : perturbation - theory ] ) suitable for oxides in which the electron exchanges energy remotely from the oscillators through an electrostatic dipole interaction .",
    "they also report experimental results for a system consisting of al and pb plates sandwiching @xmath7 doped with small organic molecules .",
    "the experiments were performed from below 1k up to 300k , and inelastic resonances corresponding to molecular vibrational frequencies were detected as peaks in the second derivative of the current - voltage curve ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "klein _ _ et al__@xcite used a similar technique , and found that different ranges of voltage probed not only the frequencies of the impurities but also of the contacts and the oxide .",
    "the technique for absorbing molecules was improved by simonsen _ _ et al__@xcite who used the liquid phase of the molecules .",
    "this made it possible for them to investigate the vibrational frequency spectrum of much larger molecules including proteins and nucleotides .",
    "kirtley and co - workers have made a series of contributions@xcite .",
    "they have investigated the effect of the choices of metal and oxide for the tunnelling device , and found that these can influence the measured spectra@xcite .",
    "they have developed a theory of the intensities of the vibrational modes using a transfer - hamiltonian formalism with wkb wavefunctions@xcite . in this model",
    "the interaction between the tunnelling electron and an oscillating molecule is through the coulomb interaction with the partial charges on the molecule .",
    "it has been applied to @xmath9 chemisorbed on alumina@xcite .",
    "multiple scattering x@xmath10 calculations showed that this long ranged potential indeed dominates the measured spectra@xcite .",
    "persson and baratoff@xcite showed that the excitation and immediate de - excitation of a molecular vibration by a tunneling electron can give a decrease in the resonant conductance .",
    "a closely related problem is the inelastic current voltage spectroscopy of a ballistic atomic metallic chain@xcite , or a single resonant molecule between two electrodes@xcite .",
    "the opening of new inelastic scattering channels , as the bias matches the energies of various phonon modes in the wire , also leads to a suppression of the electronic conductance , since , starting from ideal transmission , the conductance can only ever go down , and the inelastic i - v features take the form of dips in _ _ _ _ @xmath8 .",
    "scanning tunnelling microscopes ( stms ) have been used for inelastic spectroscopy .",
    "inspired by this , gregory@xcite created a very small junction by using two crossing gold wires with argon and carbon monoxide in between .",
    "resonant peaks were observed from hydrocarbon contaminants , as was coulomb blockade behaviour . ho and co - workers@xcite have used an stm to probe the orientation , motion and vibrational spectra of small molecules on metal surfaces .",
    "et al . _ studied a molecular transistor and found shifts in the resonances when the gate voltage was varied . with the experimental advances",
    "has gone developments in the theory .",
    "lorente and persson@xcite used density functional theory and a perturbative implementation of non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) to study @xmath11 and @xmath12 on cu(100 ) , and galperin _ et al_.@xcite used negf and a model hamiltonian to study line shapes and line widths of iets features .",
    "the bombardment of materials by high energy heavy particles occurs in a number of situations .",
    "ions with energies of order 10 kev are used for ion implantation in semiconductors@xcite , while in hydrogen fusion powerplants materials of quite extraordinary resilience are required to surround the region containing the plasma because they are subjected to bombardment by highly energetic neutrons ( 14.1 mev ) and other particles as well as exposure to very high temperatures@xcite .",
    "ion implantation of semiconductors is well understood@xcite .",
    "the type of scattering experienced by the implanted ion depends on the mass of the ion and the relative angle of its trajectory to the crystallographic axis .",
    "the distribution of implanted ions is a gaussian centred about the projected range .",
    "the projected range in turn is determined by the stopping power which has contributions both from the nuclei in the crystal and from the electrons .",
    "the stopping power ( @xmath13 ) is defined by the the projected range ( @xmath14 ) through @xmath15 , and is a sum of the nuclear and electronic components ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the electronic component has a very simple form , namely @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a constant ( in silicon it has the value @xmath19/cm ) . as the stopping power has the dimensions of a force , and is proportional to the velocity of the incoming ion ( @xmath20 ) , it is behaving as a kind of friction .",
    "there has been considerable interest in the properties of candidate materials for fusion powerplants under extreme conditions , and extensive modelling work has been performed@xcite .",
    "clearly the collisions between atoms to form cascades is an extremely important process , but the dynamics of the atoms is significantly modified by the response of the electrons to this violent motion .",
    "the dynamics of radiation damage is typically divided into three phases : the displacement phase , the relaxation phase and the cooling phase .",
    "the details of the interaction between the nuclei and electrons need not be the same in each phase because of the large variation in the energy of both the nuclei and the electrons between the phases .",
    "further , the manner in which electrons transport heat is also modified when they become highly excited@xcite , or the lattice highly disordered@xcite .",
    "there is still some controversy about precisely what happens , but there are some general ideas which are clear .",
    "highly energetic nuclei can give up substantial amounts of energy to the electrons@xcite , and in so doing experience an effective friction force@xcite .",
    "as the coefficient of friction depends on materials parameters such as electron - phonon coupling strength and electron heat capacity , it leads to different rates of cooling in different materials , which in turn can modify both defect formation and healing of damage@xcite .",
    "there is a rather different type of process in which electrons ( light particles ) are used to bombard a metal to produce damage ( displacement of heavy particles ) though at quite a low level ( @xmath21 to @xmath22 displacements per atom ) .",
    "subsequent measurement of the variation of resistance as a function of increasing temperature during annealing of the damaged material provides direct information about the diffusion barrier heights of point defects , which would be difficult to obtain any other way@xcite .",
    "as all theories involve some kind of simplification of reality , they must all throw away features that are considered unimportant .",
    "however , there will always be cases where what is normally unimportant suddenly takes centre stage . when thinking about the interaction of atoms with each other , it is usually a very good approximation to assume that the electrons are so light , and thus move so fast relative to the nuclei , that over the time it takes for the nuclei to undergo a significant displacement ( say @xmath23s ) , the electrons will have undergone so many collisions , both with nuclei ( possibly as much as 1000 times in a simple classical view ) and with each other , that they will have settled down into a well - defined state ( normally taken to be their ground state , or more generally that state which minimizes the chosen free energy ) .",
    "thus , we can treat the state of the electrons as known once the _ positions _ of the nuclei are given .",
    "this is the born - oppenheimer approximation , whose chief characteristic is that it allows us to treat the electrons and ions separately , and is ubiquitous because it greatly simplifies the process of understanding matter at the atomic scale .",
    "however , the born - oppenheimer separation is an approximation , and there are phenomena it can not describe , notably those that are the subject of this review . to understand the nature of this approximation , and why it is unable to describe the irreversible transfer of energy between electrons and nuclei , we need only note the following .",
    "even if the nuclei start at rest , collisions with electrons will result in small energy transfers to nuclei ( of order 0.1% or less of the electron energy per collision , classically ) .",
    "once they have started to fluctuate , the nuclei can transfer kinetic energy back to the electrons in individual electron - nuclear collisions .",
    "but this two - way inelastic energy transfer depends on the _ velocities _ of the colliding particles .",
    "this dependence lies beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "fortunately , the amount of energy transferred in one collision is very small .",
    "thus the departure from the born - oppenheimer approximation is a rather weak effect and so it makes sense to use perturbation theory .",
    "the perturbation can be characterised by those contributions to the forces on the nuclei that involve _ two _ electronic states , corresponding to electrons scattering from one state to another .",
    "the unperturbed electronic states are some representation of the born - oppenheimer energy surfaces , and for the nuclei harmonic oscillator states associated with small displacements from equilibrium positions on those surfaces are usually used ( see [ sec : the - electron - phonon - hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "lowest order perturbation theory can then be used to evaluate the rate of change of some quantity ( such as the degree of excitation of the nuclear vibrations ) as a result of the perturbation . for systems",
    "in which well - defined reference states can be defined , this prescription provides not only insight into mechanisms , but also numbers that can be compared with experiment .",
    "examples include joule heating in metals and non - radiative transitions at point defects in semiconductors .    however , there are systems in which it is difficult to set up the reference systems .",
    "if the nuclei undergo substantial displacements , so that the concept of a reference position is not well - defined ( for example , flexible polymer strands in contact with a heat bath , or a metal subject to high - energy bombardment ) then neither the electronic nor nuclear states are straightforward to characterise . however , such systems have the feature that much of their behaviour can be well described by molecular dynamics carried out within the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "so , the natural consequence is to see if the standard molecular dynamics algorithms can be revised to include the effects of the breakdown of the born - oppenheimer approximation . since the full coupled problem is insoluble except in the simplest of cases we have to investigate possible approximations .    in the following sections we discuss possible mathematical methods , both perturbative and molecular dynamics based , that can be used to investigate non - adiabatic processes .",
    "we begin with a simple classical model in which both the nuclei and the electrons are treated as classical particles obeying newton s equations of motion .",
    "this can not be considered a particularly realistic model , but it is simple to understand and in fact reveals much of the physics .",
    "we then proceed with the methods that make explicit use of born - oppenheimer surfaces and oscillator states , both perturbative and non - perturbative .",
    "finally we survey the methods based on molecular dynamics .",
    "while a classical model of the motion of electrons may not provide us with a quantitative scheme in general , it makes it easy to understand inelastic processes . to illustrate the points made we will look at the heating of an atom by a current of electrons@xcite .",
    "the physical setup is as follows .",
    "we have an atom in a solid for which the influence of the neighbouring atoms is represented by a spring ( an einstein model ) .",
    "the electrons we treat as independent particles which can interact with the oscillating atom .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system is the sum of an electron hamiltonian ( @xmath24 ) , an atom hamiltonian ( @xmath25 ) and a coupling hamiltonian ( @xmath26)@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the interaction potential between electron @xmath29 and the atom , and we have made the approximation @xmath30 , which corresponds to small atomic displacements . using hamilton s equations we can write down the equations of motion for the electrons and for the atom@xmath31 in the absence of the coupling hamiltonian @xmath26 , from eq .",
    "[ eq : cm02 ] we can write down an explicit solution for the atomic motion ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "furthermore , the electrons move independently of one another , with each electron moving with a constant energy ( the scattering from the atom is elastic ) .",
    "once we include the coupling hamiltonian , this all changes .",
    "we can no longer write down a simple closed form expression for the atomic motion as it now depends on all the electrons ; the electrons are no longer completely independent because their motion depends on @xmath33 , which in turn depends on all the electrons ; and electrons no longer move with constant energy because they experience an external time varying force .",
    "it is the third point that is the main topic of this review .",
    "we can solve these equations for the case of motion in one dimension in which the atom appears as a hard wall potential to the electrons . in this case , by conserving energy and momentum during a collision , we get the following approximate expression@xcite for the power delivered to the atom ( @xmath34 ) by a current ( @xmath35 ) of electrons in the limit that the electrons are much lighter than the atom@xmath36 where @xmath37and @xmath38 are the mean kinetic energies for the electrons and atom respectively . we see that there are two contributions , one positive from the electrons ( which provides heating ) and one negative from the atom ( which leads to cooling ) .",
    "the energy scale relevant to the electron kinetic energy is @xmath39 , where @xmath2 is the applied bias . at low temperatures ,",
    "the energy scale relevant to the atom kinetic energy is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the vibrational frequency of the atom .",
    "thus for very small bias we might expect cooling , but for typical voltages we expect the electrons to heat the atom , as is indeed observed .",
    "equations [ eq : cm02 ] enable us also to see explicitly the microscopic correlated electron - nuclear fluctuations that nucleate non - radiative inelastic processes and mediate the inelastic exchange of energy between the two subsystems . consider an electron bound in an orbit with radius @xmath42 and speed @xmath43 around a nucleus .",
    "the nucleus starts off at rest , at the bottom of the parabolic well provided by the rest of the lattice .",
    "let us solve eq .",
    "[ eq : cm02 ] approximately as follows .",
    "to lowest order , ignore the motion of @xmath44 in the second equation .",
    "then the electron remains in the original orbit and provides a sinusoidally varying external force on the nucleus , of amplitude @xmath45 and frequency @xmath46 , along each of the two axes in whose plane the orbit lies .",
    "the nucleus in turn is now a driven harmonic oscillator . if we solve the equation motion for the nucleus assuming that it starts at rest , then the average kinetic energy over one period of oscillation of the nucleus is given by@xmath47 if @xmath48 , we see a resonance , with violent heating of the nucleus .",
    "this resonance is the classical analogue of the quantum transitions that become activated when the two frequencies match . in the limit @xmath49 ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath38 settles at @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "the nucleus has acquired some kinetic energy , and thus is no longer sitting still .",
    "the underlying motion of the nucleus , responsible for @xmath38 above , is the wobble of a heavy particle induced by the passage of a light particle , familiar from planetary physics . as a consequence of this correlated wobble ,",
    "nuclei are never truly frozen : momentum conservation , with the consequence that light and heavy particles always orbit a common centre of mass , leads to a repartitioning of energy between the two systems , in a ratio controlled by @xmath52 .",
    "in this section we consider those methods that make explicit use of energy surfaces , and the non - adiabatic coupling between them .",
    "there is a generic model that has been successfully applied to a huge number of problems : it is the two level harmonic model ( or spin - boson hamiltonian ) and is often considered in the presence of a dissipative bath@xcite .",
    "it has the advantage of providing useful insights pictorially as well as through numbers . in figure",
    "[ fig : tls01 ] is shown a representative system .",
    "the two diabatic surfaces ( see [ sec : the - electron - phonon - hamiltonian ] ) have the same curvature ( vibrational frequency ) , but their minima are offset relative to each other both in energy and position .",
    "there are three other characteristic energies , two associated with vertical ( for example , optical ) transitions ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath13 is the huang - rhys factor ) , and one associated with non - radiative transitions ( @xmath55 ) . it is the latter that interests us here .",
    "the quantity @xmath56 is the barrier height that a classical oscillator on the upper energy surface has to overcome to cross onto the lower energy surface .",
    "the transition between the surfaces is a quantum process ( involving an electronic transition ) .",
    "this can correspond to a number of physical phenomena , with an important one in the solid state being electron capture ( or emission ) by a charge trap in a semiconductor@xcite , and another being atomic collisions with crystal surfaces@xcite .",
    "this combination of quantum and classical descriptions was turned into a transition rate in 1932 both by zener and landau@xcite , and has been extended in a number of ways since ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the essence of the original landau - zener theory is as follows .",
    "the oscillating atoms ( represented by just one coordinate , @xmath44 in figure [ fig : tls01 ] , and from now on referred to as the oscillator ) move on a diabatic energy surface .",
    "the coupling to the neighbouring surface is so weak ( because of charge rearrangment in the case zener studied ) that a transition is unlikely , so we can neglect the influence of the transition on the dynamics of the oscillator for the purpose of determining the transition rate .",
    "no transition is possible except very near to the crossing . in this region",
    "the energy surfaces are treated as linear , and the velocity of the oscillator as constant . by solving the time dependent schrdinger equation for the electrons subject to the time varying potential due to the oscillator",
    ", the probability of a transition during one pass of the oscillator over the crossing is found to be@xcite @xmath57 with @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the electronic matrix element coupling the two surfaces , and @xmath60 is the energy difference between the surfaces . the transition rate",
    "is then given by @xmath61@xcite where @xmath62 is the vibrational frequency .",
    "there is a long history of using perturbation theory for studying non - adiabatic processes , both in the solid state and elsewhere .",
    "a very important context for its use is in the boltzmann equation treatment of the transport properties of solids@xcite .",
    "fermi s golden rule gives the transition rate from state @xmath63 to state @xmath64@xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the unperturbed hamiltonian , and @xmath69 is the perturbing hamiltonian driving the transition . for the case of interest to us",
    "( electrons interacting with mobile nuclei ) from [ sec : the - electron - phonon - hamiltonian ] we can identify @xmath63 with @xmath70 , @xmath64 with @xmath71 , @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 , where @xmath76 indexes electronic states and @xmath77 indexes nuclear states . to make the integrals in the energies and transition matrix elements tractable , the harmonic approximation is used for the nuclear states . for the adiabatic representation ( see [ sec : the - electron - phonon - hamiltonian ] ) some further decisions about the dependence of the electronic wave functions on nuclear coordinate is also necessary .",
    "these decisions are implicit in the static lattice representation . in the context of non - radiative transitions the choice of approximation is discussed in detail by stoneham in review articles @xcite and a book@xcite .",

    "the effect of the averaging over electronic trajectories in the ehrenfest approximation is to break the microscopic correlations between the force experienced by the nucleus due to the electrons and the momentum of the nucleus , and thus to suppress the energy that can be transferred to the nucleus .",

    "this is just another manifestation of the averaging discussed above .",
    "these problems manifest themselves in the failure to produce certain outcomes in simulations , such as heating of nuclei by current carrying electrons@xcite , thermal equlibrium between electrons and nuclei@xcite , and correct transition probablilities@xcite .",
    "various schemes have been proposed to overcome these problems .",
    "one starting point is to recognise that the ionic wavefunction rapidly decoheres after a transition leading to modified equations of motion@xcite , or to a stochastic algorithm in which trajectories on separate born - oppenheimer energy surfaces are treated as independent ( see section [ sub : surface - hopping - methods ] below ) .",
    "another is to treat the electrons and nuclei as having correlated motion leading to wavepacket - like methods@xcite ( see section [ sub : correlated - electron - ion - dynamics ] below ) .    while the ehrenfest approximation is often presented in the literature as a straw man ( that is , a method used simply to show how much better other methods are ) , it is also used to obtain useful results .",
    "two applications are :    1 .",
    "time - dependent density functional theory has been used successfully to study the friction forces experienced by hydrogen atoms scattering off a metallic surface @xcite .",

    "investigations have included : polaron drift in an applied electric field @xcite ; the dynamics of polarons formed after the excitation of electrons by photons @xcite ; the nucleation of stable self - localised excitations @xcite .",
    "surface hopping was originally proposed by tully and preston @xcite as a phenomenological extension of the classical trajectory method which incorporates non - adiabatic effects . in the classical trajectory method ,",

    "quantities such as reaction cross sections are obtained as averages over the ensemble .    as mentioned in the previous section , within the ehrenfest approximation nuclei",
    "feel a force from the electrons that is an average over many electronic trajectories . in cases where adiabatic electronic states are close to each other in energy over relatively small regions of space and",
    "are well separated otherwise , as in the case of a non - adiabatic chemical reaction , when the nuclei leave a region of strong coupling the force felt by them is a weighted average of the force in each surface .",
    "tully and preston _ _ _ _ observe that _ ",
    "\" intuition requires that the motion take place on one surface or the other\"_. that is , after going through a region where there is significant coupling between surfaces the ions must stay on the original surface on which they were moving or jump to a different one .",
    "this intuition is guided by the fact that in a molecular beam experiment , reactants convert to one set of products or the other , but one does not detect states which are mixture of different product channels .",
    "this implies some decoherence of any mixed state before the outcome is measured ( or during the measurement ) , which in turn suggests a picture of the dynamics in which nuclei move adiabatically unless they encounter a region of strong non - adiabatic coupling .",
    "this can be either a point where adiabatic surfaces cross or where they are close in energy .",
    "this idea was implemented into the first realization of the surface hopping procedure by determining a fixed region or set of points in configuration space where switching between adiabatic states is likely .",
    "when the system passes through those regions during the dynamics the decision to hop to a different surface is taken according to a probability calculated from the landau - zener expression ( see section [ sub : landau - zener - theory ] ) .",
    "after a jump to a different potential energy surface has taken place , the nuclei change their potential energy by a finite amount , which is small if the jump occurs when the two surfaces are close to each other . in order to conserve energy the surface hopping procedure",

    "when this expansion is combined with molecular dynamics , we refer to it as correlated electron - ion dynamics ( ceid ) .",
    "the starting point is the ehrenfest equations ( which are , of course exact , and which give the name to the approximation):@xmath255 where @xmath256 and @xmath257 , and @xmath258 and @xmath259 are the position and momentum operators for the nuclei . in the ehrenfest approximation",
    "we were able to work with a single trajectory : in that case @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "however , since the ehrenfest equations refers to quantum nuclei , the uncertainty principle makes it impossible to have individual trajectories . the best we can manage are narrow wave packets ( see figure [ cap : the - central - idea ] ) . in this case @xmath262 and @xmath263 correspond to the trajectory of the mean of the wave packet .    if the wave packets really are narrow ( which they often are in condensed systems ) , then we can expand @xmath264 about @xmath265 in the following way@xcite ( where @xmath266 and @xmath265 stand for the set of coordinates @xmath267 and @xmath268 respectively):@xmath269 where @xmath270 .",
    "then the mean force ( eq . [ eq : same00 ] ) satisfies@xmath271 where @xmath272 , @xmath273 , and @xmath274 .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "[ eq : same02 ] is the ehrenfest approximation .",
    "the higher terms account for the fact that the wave packet has some finite width , and that the mean force must include an average over the paths included within the packet .",
    "however , at this point it is important to note a fundamental distinction .",
    "there are _ two _ separate contributions to the total width of the wave packet .",
    "the more obvious is just the normal quantum width of the nucleus , and this contributes to @xmath275 and higher moments .",
    "the other contribution is due to transitions between born - oppenheimer surfaces . if a nucleus starts a trajectory on one particular born - oppenheimer energy surface , and there is some coupling to another surface , then that trajectory will split into two trajectories , one on each surface .",
    "since the forces experienced on each surface can be different the two trajectories can deviate from one another , producing broadening of the total wave packet . the first moment ( @xmath276 )",
    "contains only this contribution , but it appears in all other moments as well .",
    "we now seek to understand the meaning of the moments .",
    "first we note that @xmath187 , @xmath276 and @xmath275 are electronic operators ( the traces have only been taken over the nuclear degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we can therefore take matrix elements with respect to electronic states .",
    "suppose we have energy surfaces @xmath10 characterised by a set of electronic states @xmath81 .",
    "we then have@xmath277 where @xmath278 , and is the ionic density projected onto surface @xmath10 .",
    "thus @xmath279 is just the probability of being on surface @xmath280 if we define the mean value of some observable @xmath281 on surface @xmath10 to be @xmath282 then @xmath283 just equals the mean position of the nucleus on the surface , measured relative to the mean trajectory @xmath262 , multiplied by the probability of being on that surface .",
    "similarly , @xmath284 gives the width of the packet moving on surface @xmath10 , multiplied by the probability of being on that surface , and thus is a measure of the quantum width of the nucleus .",
    "thus , in summary , the small amplitude moment expansion corrects the ehrenfest approximation by allowing different trajectories on different energy surfaces , and by giving the nuclei a finite quantum width . to make this into a practical method we need some efficient way of evaluating the moments @xmath276 , @xmath275 ,",
    "etc_. this is achieved by integrating their equations of motion@xcite .",
    "these equations follow from the liouville equation ( eq . [ eq : efest-01 ] ) , and the definition of the moments .",
    "thus we have@xmath285-\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{i}\\hbar}\\sum_{\\nu}\\left[\\hat{f}_{\\nu},\\hat{\\mu}_{1,\\nu}\\right]+\\cdots\\nonumber \\\\ \\fl\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\hat{\\mu}_{1,\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}t } & = & \\frac{\\hat{\\lambda}_{1,\\nu}}{m_{\\nu}}+\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{i}\\hbar}\\left[\\hat{h}_{e}(\\bar{r}),\\hat{\\mu}_{1,\\nu}\\right]+\\cdots\\nonumber \\\\",

    "we can obtain a rather straightforward interpretation of these equations by considering matrix elements of the moments with respect to the electronic states @xmath81 , provided @xmath291 . under these conditions from eq .",
    "[ eq : same04 ] we obtain@xmath292 the first equation ( for the diagonal elements of the electronic density matrix ) tells us that transitions between born - oppenheimer surfaces are driven by force couplings between the surfaces . if we think of @xmath283 as the position of a nucleus on the surface multiplied by the probability of being on the surface , and @xmath293 as the momentum of a nucleus on the surface multiplied by the probability of being on the surface ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : same03 ] ) , then the second equation just gives the usual relation between velocity and momentum ( provided the probability of being on the surface is not changing ) .",
    "finally , the third equation relates the rate of change of momentum of the nucleus on the surface to the force that it is experiencing ( the diagonal force term ) , plus some additional corrections derived from the non - adiabatic interactions .",
    "thus we see that the small amplitude moment expansion at lower orders is describing classical trajectories on multiple born - oppenheimer surfaces .    for a practical implementation of the scheme we need to truncate the infinite hierarchy of equations of motion for the moments . if we work with a fixed order of expansion for the hamiltonian ( in practice dropping cubic and higher terms in the taylor expansion in eq .",
    "[ eq : same01 ] ) , then for the highest order moments for which we have equations of motion there will be additional moments appearing in those equations for which there is no corresponding equation of motion . to produce closure",
    "we therefore need to estimate these higher moments from the lower ones already evaluated . for metallic systems , where nuclear wave packets mostly breathe without splitting ,",
    "satisfactory results have been obtained@xcite by a mean field approximation which relates @xmath275 and other second moment operators to products of their own traces and @xmath187 .",
    "this procedure is a simple case of a general formalism which is currently under development .",
    "first we reconstruct an approximate density matrix from the known moments , then we perform the necessary traces with this density matrix to produce the required additional moments .",
    "this process is made much easier because of two remarkable theorems .",
    "consider a density matrix for which a wigner transform has been carried out over the nuclear decrees of freedom ( see [ sec : the - wigner - transform ] ) , to give @xmath294 which is an electronic operator which depends parametrically on the nuclear positions and momenta .",
    "for one nuclear degree of freedom the first theorem states@xcite that@xmath295 which relates the moments of the wigner matrix to those of the density matrix .",
    "the second theorem states that for quadratic hamiltonians the moments appearing in ceid can always be written in the form given by the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : xc01 ] . in short ,",
    "ceid moments are moments of the wigner function .",
    "this has two immediate consequences .",
    "first , we do not have to worry about the order of the operators in the moments , so that we can completely characterise the moments by the powers of position and momentum .",
    "second , since the wigner function is a function of scalars we can approximate this function using standard techniques , rather than attempting the much more complex process of approximating functions of operators . for ceid",
    "we use harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions to expand the wigner function ( an approach which has been used in other similar contexts@xcite ) .",
    "the final result is that the unknown moments can be expressed as a linear combination of the known , with constant coefficients .",
    "an alternative approach ( that has _ not _ been investigated with ceid ) has been used in a related method@xcite .    to use this method with popular approximate electronic structure methods ( such as hartree - fock or tight binding - and",
    "possibly density functional theory , though there are additional theoretical problems in this case ) it is necessary to reduce the n - electron problem into a 1-electron problem ( that is , an extension of hartree - fock theory ) .",
    "this is achieved by taking the @xmath77-electron equations of motion ( eq . [ eq : same04 ] ) and taking a trace over all the electrons except one .",
    "this produces equations of motion for 1-electron operators .",
    "however , in those equations of motion 2-electron operators appear .",
    "to reduce the theory to a pure 1-electron theory we need to replace these 2-electron operators with suitable functions of 1-electron operators .",
    "this is based on the density matrix product used in the hartree - fock approximation . in matrix notation",
    "the product is @xmath296 , where the numbers 1 and 2 refer to the set of indices for electrons 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "however , this equation by itself is not enough .",
    "there are two reasons : first , we need to approximate 2-electron moments as well as the electronic density matrix@xcite ; second , since the electron density matrix used in ceid involves a trace over multiple nuclear configurations , we need to take an appropriate average of products of single particle density matrices , even for the electron density matrix@xcite . in both cases",
    "the starting point is the same , namely to write the moment ( @xmath297 ) we are interested in terms of the product of nuclear fluctuations ( @xmath281 ) in the following way@xmath298 where @xmath299 , @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "the operator @xmath302 is an electronic density matrix to which we apply the hartree - fock approximation . to evaluate the integrals over nuclear coordinates we need to make an approximation for the @xmath303 dependence of @xmath302 .",
    "we make a taylor expansion in powers of @xmath304 about @xmath305 , which corresponds to weak dynamic coupling between the electrons and nuclei . for details",
    "see references@xcite . here",
    "we briefly consider the the result of the above procedure for the electronic density matrix :    @xmath306    where @xmath307 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 are the matrix representations of the two - electron density matrix , the one electron density matrix and the one electron first moment respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath310 is the inverse of @xmath311 .",
    "we see that the density matrix is not quite idempotent even for noninteracting electrons , which is because there are electron - ion correlations and a dynamical response of the electrons to nuclear fluctuations .",
    "this response , described by the second term , screens the ion - ion interactions .",
    "the resultant dynamical stiffness corrections are essential for getting the correct phonon structure and inelastic electron - phonon spectrum@xcite .",
    "historically , ceid was developed to allow electric current induced heating in nanoscale devices to be modelled .",
    "therefore , open boundaries have been a consideration from the beginning , and have now been implemented in two ways .",
    "the first starts from eqs .",
    "[ eq : same00 ] and [ eq : same04 ] given above@xcite . to produce a finite system with open boundaries we consider our system as being embedded in an infinite environment , and apply our equations of motion to the infinite combined system .",
    "clearly we can not explicitly evolve the electron density matrix and the moments for an infinite system , so we make use of the fact that we can write down analytic solutions for the evolution of the electron density matrix and the moments provided that the hamiltonian does not vary with time .",
    "this allows us to write down closed form solutions for the environment which we then couple to the explicit time evolution of the system in which we are interested .",
    "to produce numerically stable solutions it is found necessary to introduce a small amount of damping into the environment .",
    "for details see references @xcite .",
    "the second scheme , which is currently under development , achieves numerical simplifications at the expense of additional approximations .",
    "ceid is still a rather young method , so a limited range of results has so far been produced .",
    "it has been applied to joule heating in atomic wires@xcite , in which case it was found that the first moments ( @xmath276 and @xmath312 ) were essential for producing the correct heating .",
    "the second moments ( which involve @xmath313 , @xmath314 and @xmath315 ) are needed to describe the change in electrical resistance due to increased nuclear vibrations@xcite .",
    "once these were included , it was possible to reproduce the spectral signature of the inelastic scattering of electrons by nuclei .",
    "above we have surveyed some of the phenomena resulting from , and the current state of theories for understanding , the exchange of energy between electrons and nuclei .",
    "accurate modelling of the phenomena is a hard problem because of its intrinsically many - body and correlated nature . as a consequence ,",
    "all the theories are in need of further development , as has been indicated in the text . as the different theories have different attributes ( some are perturbative , others are based on molecular dynamics , and so on ) , they can naturally be applied to different problems .",
    "so there is a need for development on more than one front .",
    "the biggest advance is probably going to be in the range of problems to be addressed using these techniques .",
    "there are now standard phenomena that are studied or used to test novel methods , such as heating in nanocontacts , or photodissociation , but they are limited in scope .",
    "non - equilibrium phenomena , by contrast , are ubiquitous .",
    "certainly the modelling of molecular electronic devices and biological molecules associated with non - equilibrium electrons ( such as dna and retinal ) have already begun to be investigated , and their importance must surely increase .",
