    "rodighiero et al .",
    "2007 ) and they become very rare by @xmath22 ( e.g. dunlop , cirasuolo & mclure  2007 ) .",
    "the galaxy populations discovered at @xmath23 seem to almost exclusively consist of intermediate or low mass galaxies ( @xmath24 $ \\sim$}}~}10^{10 } \\ , \\rm m_\\odot$ ] ) , and their current study is mainly focused on constraining the epoch and sources of reionisation ( e.g. bunker et al .",

    "in fact , with the current instrumentation , only the rest - frame ultra - violet ( uv ) emission can be observed for the vast majority of these galaxies , which is used to estimate their levels of star formation and ability to produce and liberate sufficient lyman-@xmath12 photons to ionise the intergalactic medium .",
    "any constraints on the stellar masses of @xmath23 galaxies are still poor , due to the lack of sensitive data at wavelengths that map the galaxy rest - frame near - infrared ( ir ) at these redshifts ( although see e.g. labb et al .",
    "2010 for an attempt ) . nevertheless , different pieces of observational evidence suggest that massive galaxies as a significant population only appear at later times .",
    "cosmological models of galaxy formation predict that massive galaxies can be quickly formed at high-@xmath18 in the high - density fluctuations of the matter density field ( cole & kaiser  1989 ; mo & white  1996 ) .",
    "thus , determining the first epoch of appearance and subsequent rise in the number density of massive galaxies with redshift constitutes a very important constraint on galaxy formation models . investigating the period elapsed between redshifts @xmath21 and 6 - 7 is fundamental for this purpose , as it connects the earliest stages of galaxy formation after the epoch of reionisation , with the better - studied period of galaxy evolution at @xmath25 , where a substantial population of galaxies are already massive and host very intense star formation and quasar activity .",
    "a global picture of the evolution of galaxy formation and growth can be obtained through the study of the galaxy stellar mass function at different redshifts . at low redshifts , the shape of the galaxy mass function",
    "is known down to low mass limits ( @xmath26 ; e.g. cole et al .",
    "2001 ; baldry , glazebrook & driver  2008 ) and is well - fitted by a double schechter ( 1976 ) function ( baldry et al .",

    "this mechanism could be at play since earlier times , as preliminary determinations over small areas of the sky indicate that the schechter functional form could be suitable to describe the bright end of the galaxy stellar mass function up to @xmath27 ( e.g. fontana et al .",

    "we note , however , that the limits of our mid - ir survey do not allow us to properly constrain the faint end of the galaxy stellar mass function at such high redshifts .",
    "this means that a more precise determination of the slope @xmath12 will only be possible once the galaxy stellar mass function faint end can be better studied with deeper mid - ir surveys . * our derived comoving stellar mass densities are @xmath233 and @xmath234 at redshifts",

    "another key result of our work is the absence of massive galaxies at redshifts @xmath4 . within our surveyed area of 0.6 deg@xmath2",

    ", optical surveys have discovered a substantial number of intermediate stellar - mass sources at these redshifts .",
    "these findings strongly suggest that massive galaxies as a significant population only appear at later times , and that the epoch around redshifts @xmath237 is critical to understand the formation of the first massive systems .",
    "in addition , we have found that a significant fraction of the most massive galaxies present at @xmath196 would be missed by optical surveys , even as deep as @xmath16 or @xmath17 magnitudes .",
