    "<S> we show strong effects of a weak and smooth , on the magnetic length , superlattice potential upon edge magnetoplasmons ( emps ) at the armchair edge , with a smooth steplike electrostatic lateral confining potential , of a wide graphene channel in the @xmath0 quantum hall effect regime . </S>",
    "<S> the superlattice potential leads to essential enlargement of a number of emps , descend from two fundamental emps in the absence of superlattice . for the wave vector @xmath1 within the first brillouin zone , </S>",
    "<S> the emps show as the regions of acoustical or quasi - acoustical dispersion , with a finite value of group velocity , so the regions with frequency gaps , where a group velocity is nullified at some @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that for @xmath2 only for two emps the frequency tends to zero as for other emps it obtains finite values . </S>",
    "<S> strong dependence of dispersion relations of the emps from the period of the superlattice @xmath3 and the distance @xmath4 from a metallic gate is shown ; in particular , for typical size of a gap , for characteristic value of the frequency and @xmath1 at which the group velocity is reduced to zero . at the frequency that corresponds to zero group velocity of pertinent fundamental emp branch the response of the system should present a strong resonance . </S>"
