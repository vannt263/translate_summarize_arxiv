    "in classical general relativity , no hair theorems @xcite impose strong constraints on the possibility of obtaining black hole solutions of the einstein equations coupled to non - trivial scalar fields .",
    "a crucial ingredient for their proof is that the scalars be minimally coupled to gravity and other fields .",
    "when this condition is relaxed new possibilities emerge for evading the no hair theorems .",
    "one of the first investigations was undertaken by bekenstein @xcite , who attempted to show that a non - trivial black hole solution exists for a conformally coupled scalar field .",
    "although the scalar field diverges at the horizon , bekenstein argued that this solution nevertheless admits a physical interpretation .",
    "unfortunately , a more detailed analysis of the problem casts serious doubt on this @xcite .",
    "we will therefore take the view that scalar fields should be regular at the horizon for genuine black hole solutions .",
    "non - trivial scalar hair is possible , however , when black holes are coupled to scalar fields with non - linear self - interactions .",
    "such solutions were first found in the case of gravity coupled to the skyrme model @xcite , and subsequently for the einstein - yang - mills - higgs model @xcite , and other generalizations .",
    "the large literature on this topic has been recently reviewed in ref .",
    "what appears to be characteristic of the class of black holes with non - linear self - interactions is that the scalar fields fall off very rapidly at spatial infinity ",
    "e.g. , exponentially fast  and hence the asymptotic scalar charges vanish .",
    "the scalar hair is characterized instead by non - trivial charges on the horizon .",
    "a third possibility is that of minimally coupled scalar fields with potentials , @xmath0 , which violate the dominant energy condition ( dec ) @xcite . in single scalar field models ,",
    "the dec is equivalent to @xmath1 , and thus one must choose potentials for which @xmath2 for some field values .",
    "examples of asymptotically flat black hole solutions have been found for cases in which @xmath2 everywhere @xcite , and for cases in which @xmath0 possesses at least one global minimum at negative values @xcite .",
    "both analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite examples are known .",
    "a final possibility is to consider black holes with scalar fields which are non - minimally coupled to gauge fields .",
    "such models have been extensively investigated because they arise naturally in kaluza - klein theories and in the effective low - energy limit of string theory , where the dilaton plays a non - trivial role . in all these models",
    "one can find black hole solutions with non - zero scalar charges at spatial infinity @xcite .",
    "an analogous phenomenon can be shown to take place also in the pure dilaton - gravity sector of effective string theories , when one takes into account the coupling of the dilaton to gravity via gauss - bonnet terms @xcite .",
    "for this class of non - minimally coupled models with non - zero asymptotic scalar charges , however , the scalar charges in question are _ not _ independent parameters , but in all cases are a given function of the other asymptotic charges which characterize the solution , namely the adm mass and the electric and magnetic charges etc . as a result such scalar charges have been called _ secondary hair _ by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , to distinguish them from the theoretical possibility of a _ primary hair _ , namely an asymptotic scalar charge which is completely independent of the other charges .",
    "in light of all the known solutions @xcite one may therefore conjecture @xcite that a weaker form of the no - hair property still holds , namely that for theories which satisfy the dec black hole solutions can be classified by a small number of parameters , which in the case of asymptotic charges include only conserved charges such as mass , angular momentum and gauge charges , but no asymptotic scalar charges .",
    "even this no hair conjecture does not appear to be valid in general , however .",
    "in a recent paper by one of us @xcite the properties of magnetically charged black holes coupled to a dilaton , @xmath3 , and an additional modulus field , @xmath4 , according the the field equations generated by the 4-dimensional action @xcite s=14 ^ 4x\\{&-&+2^_+2^ _ + & -&f_f^ } , + were studied using techniques from the general theory of dynamical systems , which have been previously applied to static spherically symmetric solutions of gravity coupled to scalar fields in a number of contexts @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the regular black hole solutions were parameterized by an additional degree of freedom in addition to the mass , @xmath5 , and magnetic charge , @xmath6 , and it was conjectured that this degree of freedom could be considered to be a `` primary scalar hair '' .",
    "an important issue in this context is that of stability of the hairy solutions .",
    "the physical relevance of the solutions would in fact be spoiled by the presence of instabilities .",
    "instabilities are known to be present in the case of einstein  yang  mills models @xcite and the dec  violating solutions for which the stability issue has been most thoroughly studied @xcite .",
    "dilaton black holes with a single scalar do not appear to suffer from instability problems @xcite ; however , they possess only secondary hair .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to clarify and extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite by determining various relations satisfied by the charges , and discussing the stability of the solutions .",
    "we will find in particular , that although the scalar degree of freedom can not be considered to be a primary hair in the strictest sense , since it must necessarily vanish if the electromagnetic field vanishes , the regular static spherically symmetric black hole solutions are not completely specified by their mass and magnetic charge .",
    "the solutions therefore are potentially of considerable physical interest as the only known static spherically symmetric solutions with non - trivial scalar charges at spatial infinity which are not completely determined by the other asymptotic charges of the theory , and therefore provide a counter - example to some forms of the no - hair conjecture .",
    "we will show that the solutions are stable , adding significance to their interpretation .    intuitively , one might attempt to understand the physical basis of the no - hair conjecture as arising from the fact there is no scalar equivalent of gauss s law to give a conserved charge .",
    "the presence of the electromagnetic field supports the scalar charge in the case of models with a secondary scalar hair since the scalar coupling enters into the equivalent of gauss s law . in the solutions described here the scalar charges",
    "are also supported by the presence of the electromagnetic field .",
    "however , they are not entirely determined by it .",
    "it is quite consistent with past usage to adopt the terminology `` primary hair '' for the additional degrees of freedom which arise in the model @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that the scalar charges are not entirely independent of the electromagnetic field suggests a new terminology might be appropriate , as a way of capturing the finer distinctions that the present model has revealed .",
    "we will therefore refer to the scalar charges which could theoretically exist in the absence of additional non - zero gauge charges as _ elementary primary hair _",
    ", as would be consistent with the original aims of the first `` no hair '' theorems @xcite .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom which arise in the present model could by contrast be deemed to be a _ contingent primary hair_.",
    "rather than restricting our attention to solutions of the field equations obtained from varying the action ( [ action2 ] ) , we will instead consider the somewhat more general action for @xmath7 scalar fields coupled to a single @xmath8 abelian gauge field according to s=14 ^ 4x\\{&-&+21^ _ + & -&1()^2f_f^ } , + where @xmath9 , since the problem is not significantly more complicated .",
    "rather than using the coordinates which were exploited in @xcite , we will take static spherically symmetric solutions with coordinates s^2=-^2ut^2+^-2ur^2+r^2 ^ 2 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the standard round metric on a @xmath13-sphere .",
    "we take @xmath14 without loss of generality .",
    "we are primarily interested in black holes solutions with at least one regular horizon which are asymptotically flat as @xmath15 .",
    "if we assume that the gauge field is given by a magnetic monopole configuration with components f__1_2=qr^2__1_2 in an orthonormal frame then the maxwell  type equation , 1()^2_=0 , is satisfied identically , and the remaining field equations obtained from variation of the action ( [ action ] ) take the form &=&-r^2 , + r^2()+2rr()&=&2r^21 , + rr&=&-1^2 , + =2&-&2r^21 where q_aq and a prime denotes @xmath16 . by virtue of the bianchi identity one of eqs .",
    "( [ feaa])([fead ] ) can be derived from the others .",
    "one should note that in contrast to many simpler models @xcite there is no simple duality relation between magnetic and electric solutions in the theory , on account of the multi ",
    "scalar exponential coupling term which multiplies the electromagnetic part of the action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "thus we can not simply read off the properties of solutions with an electric field in place of the monopole ansatz ( [ mag ] )",
    ". it might be tempting to think of the action ( [ action ] ) as a special case of an alternative model in which each scalar field is associated with an independent @xmath8 gauge field .",
    "however , ( [ action ] ) is not a simple truncation of such a model , since such an increase of the number of @xmath8 fields would lead to @xmath7 independent maxwell  type equations , each with its own single scalar coupling , rather than a single equation of the form ( [ max ] ) .",
    "thus the present model can be expected to display differences in comparison to models in which moduli and several independent @xmath8 fields are present , allowing for the choice of duality  preserving combinations @xcite .      a straightforward proof by contradiction of the type used in refs.@xcite may be used to establish that the solutions of ( [ feaa])([fead ] ) possess at most one regular horizon .",
    "we first note that the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ feab ] ) and ( [ fead ] ) gives ",
    "= 2 which may be integrated to yield r^2=r^2+r+,for arbitrary constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that ( [ ru1 ] ) possesses at least one real zero in order that there may exist at least one horizon and thus rewrite ( [ ru1 ] ) as r^2=,where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath21 .",
    "we substitute ( [ ru2 ] ) into ( [ feaa ] ) to obtain =-r^2 ,    let us now suppose that , @xmath22 , both values @xmath23 correspond to regular horizons , and that @xmath24 for any one of the scalar fields . since the scalar is smooth at the horizon , if we evaluate ( [ feba ] ) at @xmath25 we obtain ( r_+-r_-)(r_+)=-r^2(r_+)q_a^2 ^ -2 ( r_+)from which it follows that @xmath26 . similarly , if we evaluate ( [ feba ] ) at @xmath27 we see that @xmath28 . now given that @xmath29 is assumed to be smooth , it follows that it must have a maximum at an intermediate value @xmath30 such that @xmath31 .",
    "however , if we evaluate ( [ feba ] ) at @xmath30 we obtain ( r_0-r_-)(r_0-r_+)(r_0)=-r^2(r_0)q_a^2 ^-2(r_0)from which it follows that @xmath32 , giving a minimum , which is a contradiction .",
    "thus if @xmath33 is regular at @xmath25 it can not also be regular at @xmath27 .",
    "the point @xmath27 should thus correspond to a curvature singularity .",
    "similarly , if we assume that @xmath34 , then all the signs in the above arguments are reversed but we still obtain contradiction .",
    "it therefore follows that the solutions can at most possess one regular horizon , at @xmath25 .",
    "it is also useful to note that if @xmath24 then @xmath35 must be monotonically decreasing on the domain of outer communications of regular black hole solutions , since if it reached a minimum at a finite value @xmath36 then at such a point eq .",
    "( [ phimin ] ) would once again be true , but now with the implication that @xmath37 , again giving a contradiction . likewise if @xmath34 then @xmath35 is monotonically increasing for @xmath38 .",
    "the function @xmath39 must be monotonically increasing in the domain of outer communications for either sign of @xmath40 , since by ( [ feac ] ) @xmath41 at finite @xmath42 for any solutions with non - trivial scalars .",
    "this leaves a global maximum as the only possible turning point for the function @xmath39 , but such a choice would be inconsistent with asymptotic flatness , since by ( [ ru2 ] ) @xmath43 as @xmath44 , given @xmath45 .",
    "an additional first integral of the field equations may be extracted as follows : take the difference of ( [ feab ] ) and ( [ fead ] ) , eliminate terms involving @xmath46 using ( [ ru2 ] ) , and eliminate terms involving @xmath47 using ( [ feaa ] ) . integrating the resulting equation one obtains",
    "r^21=rr-r+cwhere @xmath48 is an arbitrary constant . in order to obtain solutions which are regular at the outer horizon , it is in fact necessary to choose @xmath49 . with this choice , and again using ( [ ru2 ] ) , ( [ rp1 ] )",

    "we see that @xmath27 will correspond to a singularity , as expected from above .",
    "unfortunately , it does not appear to be possible to obtain an analytic solution in closed form to the remaining field equations .",
    "since one of the @xmath7 scalar equations ( [ feaa ] ) can be eliminated with the use of ( [ phisum ] ) , and since the function @xmath51 is given in terms of the function @xmath52 according to ( [ ru2 ] ) , we are left with one first order ode for @xmath52 , namely & & ( r^2r^2 + 1^2)(r - r_+ ) ( r - r_-)-2rr ( r - m)+1 + & & = 1r^2 1coupled nonlinearly to @xmath53 independent second order odes ( [ feba ] ) for the scalars .",
    "this is equivalent therefore to a system of @xmath54 first order odes , which can be solved numerically .",
    "much useful analytic information about the solutions can be obtained in relation to the values of the adm mass , @xmath5 , and the @xmath7 scalar charges , @xmath55 , which correspond to the @xmath56 terms in the asymptotic expansions at spatial infinity , & = & 1 - 2mr+u_2r^2 + ",

    ".the @xmath57 coefficient , @xmath58 , of the function @xmath59 is a gauge parameter whose value fixes the choice of origin of the radial coordinate , @xmath42 .",
    "we will use this gauge freedom to set @xmath60 expanding eq .",

    "if the scalar equations ( [ feaa ] ) are integrated on this interval , for example , we find that = ^2_r_+^rr^2 .",

    "thus the charges @xmath55 do not constitute an elementary primary scalar hair according to the definition adopted in the introduction .    at first sight one might be tempted to assume that eqs .",
    "( [ screl ] ) provide constraints on all @xmath7 scalar charges , and that we are therefore dealing with a system with purely secondary scalar hair .",
    "however , this is _ not _ in fact the case since the lower limit of integration , @xmath66 , already depends on the adm mass and scalar charges according to ( [ rpm1 ] ) .",
    "the nature of the relations ( [ screl ] ) is more readily understood if we rewrite them in terms of functions @xmath67 , @xmath68 , which have the leading order behaviour @xmath69 at spatial infinity .",
    "we then see that equations ( [ screl ] ) can be rewritten as = 12 for @xmath70 .",
    "since the bounds of integration are independent of the moduli vacuum charges , we see that the relations ( [ screl ] ) or ( [ screl2 ] ) are constraints which determine the @xmath61 in terms of @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath55 .",
    "let us turn to the question of whether there exist any constraints on the scalar charges @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , there appears to be only one additional constraint on the asymptotic charges .",
    "this may be determined by noting that if one multiplies each of the scalar equations ( [ feaa ] ) by @xmath71 and then takes the sum of the resulting @xmath7 equations plus @xmath72 times the difference of eqs .",

    "the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) reduces the number of independent scalar charges to @xmath53 .",
    "do any further constraints remain to be found ? in the @xmath75 case of two scalar fields",
    "this can not be the case , given the numerical results of fig .  1 and the results of the dynamical systems analysis of ref",
    ".  @xcite : any further constraints would mean we no longer had a primary hair in contradiction with the results derived there . we will argue that no further constraints exist for @xmath76 either .",
    "in particular , if further constraints exist on the charges then it would be possible to extract them from the field equations .",
    "if we consider the field equations at spatial infinity , then solving order by order in inverse powers of @xmath42 no constraints on the charges @xmath55 are found , though we do find that all coefficients of terms @xmath77 , @xmath78 , in the asymptotic series ( [ asyma])([asymc ] ) are completely determined . at the next order , for example , u_2&= & ,",
    "+ _ 2&=&m-12_a , + 2&=&-1 ^ 2.solutions with the asymptotic expansions ( [ asyma])([asymc ] ) include many which correspond to naked singularities rather than black holes .",
    "the requirement that solutions also have a regular horizon leads to the further constraints ( [ screl2 ] ) , ( [ constraint ] ) found upon integrating the independent field equations from @xmath25 to spatial infinity , as above .",
    "however , we can obtain no more than one constraint for each independent field equation ( [ feba ] ) , ( [ febb ] ) , and the relations ( [ screl2 ] ) , ( [ constraint ] ) which give one constraint for each equation , exhaust the possibilities .",

    "some thermodynamic relations may be obtained , given that the black hole temperature and entropy are defined at the horizon , @xmath66 , which is related to the mass by ( [ rpm1 ] ) . in particular , let us evaluate the derivative of ( [ ru2 ] ) at the horizon . in terms of the surface gravity , @xmath79 , the horizon area @xmath80 , and using substituting for @xmath66 from ( [ rpm1 ] )",

    ", we also note that according to ( [ rpm1 ] ) , the mass @xmath5 is a homogeneous function of degree @xmath83 in @xmath84 , and of degree one in each @xmath55 .",
    "the appropriate first law of black hole mechanics for the system is therefore m = ts+1_awhere we have identified the temperature , @xmath85 , and entropy , @xmath86 , in the usual fashion .",

    "we have further shown that in the case of two scalar fields , that the black hole solutions are classically stable to radial perturbations , a feature which is absent in the case of a number of other hairy black hole solutions .",

    "ii would be any different .",
    "our present analysis indicates that the primary hair of the multiscalar black holes has quite novel features as compared to the case of other hairy black holes . in particular , while the black hole is characterized by new independent degrees of freedom which are defined at spatial infinity , these charges must necessarily vanish if the magnetic field is turned off . to distinguish such scalar hair from the case of _ elementary primary scalar hair _ , which would theoretical exist even in the absence of gauge charges , we identify this new form of hair as _ contingent primary scalar hair_. this suggests a further refinement of the no hair theorems by the statement : _ in theories satisfying the dec , black holes do not possess elementary primary scalar hair_.    our analysis of the thermodynamic properties of the solutions has been limited to the derivation of a smarr formula , and of the first law",
    ". a further step would be the thorough study of the thermodynamical properties of the solutions using explicit numerical solutions .",
    "we also remark that solutions with properties analogous to those of the model studied in this paper have been obtained in the case of gauss - bonnet gravity non - minimally coupled to two scalar fields @xcite",
