    "ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) are the most energetic particles known in nature with energies exceeding @xmath1 ev , the observation of particles with such high energies raises many interesting questions about their origin and composition that involve both astrophysics and particle physics .    soon after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation it was shown that the flux of uhe protons should be characterized by a sharp steepening at energy @xmath2  ev , due to the photo - pion production process on the cmb radiation field @xcite .",
    "this effect is the well known greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cut - off .",
    "after a few decades of observations the detection of the gzk steepening of the cr flux is one of the major open problems in cr physics with experimental data still not conclusive .",
    "the agasa experiment @xcite observed 11 events with energy @xmath3 ev in contrast with the expected depletion due to the gzk effect ; on the other hand the hires experiment @xcite observed an uhecr flux in agreement with the gzk cutoff @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between these two experimental results has been widely discussed and recently it has been shown that the gzk feature can not be accurately determined with the small sample of events collected by agasa and hires and that the discrepancy between the two experiments has a low statistical significance ( at a @xmath4 level ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , agasa and hires are based on different experimental techniques : a ground array the former and a fluorescence detector the latter . taking this difference into account , the differing results of agasa and hires can be interpreted assuming the presence of a @xmath5 systematic error in the relative energy determination . as shown by @xcite , correcting for these systematics the observations of agasa and hires are brought into agreement at energies @xmath6 ev and the discrepancy at the highest energies is softened .",
    "recently , the pierre auger observatory @xcite , under completion in argentina , published its first observations of the uhecr flux combining the ground based and fluorescence detection techniques .",
    "this preliminary result seems to confirm the presence of the gzk steepening @xcite .",
    "the presence of an excess of very high energy events , as claimed by agasa , inspired the introduction of several exotic models for the production of uhecr .",
    "these models , collectively called top - down , reproduce the excess of agasa and give also an explanation for the lack of any clear astrophysical counterpart to the highest energy events observed . indeed , at energies @xmath7 ev the proton attenuation lenght is only about @xmath8 mpc and an astrophysical source at this distance should have been seen at least in different frequency ranges .",
    "this evidence could imply that particles with energy @xmath9 ev have a different ( top - down ) origin respect to those at lower energies .",
    "many different ideas have been proposed among top - down models : strongly interacting neutrinos @xcite and new light hadrons @xcite as unabsorbed signal carriers , @xmath10-bursts @xcite , lorentz - invariance violation @xcite , topological defects ( td ) ( see @xcite for a review ) , and superheavy dark matter ( shdm ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the two models based on shdm and td have common features : in both cases uhecr are produced in the decay ( shdm ) or annihilation ( td ) of super - heavy particles , with a typical mass @xmath11 gev , that we will call collectively x - particles .",
    "as already discussed in @xcite , td are distributed over cosmological distances therefore give only a marginal contribution to the uhecr flux .",
    "we will not discuss this case here , concentrating our attention on the shdm hypothesis .",
    "the possible existence of super heavy relic particles is an interesting conclusion of modern cosmology , being first suggested in connection with uhecr production @xcite and later developed as a suitable candidate for dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "two main problems should be addressed in the discussion of shdm models : how particles with very high mass ( @xmath11 gev ) can be quasi - stable , with a lifetime much longer than the age of the universe @xmath12 , and how their abundance can be dominant in the universe today .",
    "the stability of shdm can be achieved assuming the existence of a discrete gauge simmetry that protects the particle from decaying , in the same way as neutralino stability through r - parity in super symmetry ( susy ) .",
    "this discrete simmetry can be weakly broken , assuring a lifetime @xmath13 , through wormhole @xcite or instanton @xcite effects , an example of a particle with a lifetime exceeding the age of the universe can be found in @xcite .",
    "the abundance of shdm can easily be dominant in the universe today , with a shdm density @xmath14 .",
    "this effect can be obtained by gravitational production that resembles the production of density fluctuations during inflation @xcite .    the top - down hypothesis and ,",
    "in particular , the uhecr production through shdm decay can account only for the highest energy part of the observed spectrum , as in the case of agasa excess at energies @xmath7 ev @xcite .",
    "however , uhecr observations can not exclude shdm as explanation of the dm problem , assuming that shdm is gravitationally produced than the x particle mass and density are unambiguously fixed , the only free parameter left to fit uhecr observations is the life - time @xmath15 .",
    "the observation of the agasa excess fixes this value as @xmath16 y @xcite . from the hires , yakutsk and auger data , that are compatible with the gzk steepening , follows only a lower bound on the value of @xmath15 . within this",
    "lower bound it is still possible to test the shdm hypothesis being connected with a _ subdominant _ contribution to the observed uhecr flux . in the present paper",
    "we will discuss such a possibility referring in particular to the observations of chemical composition and anisotropy of the auger observatory .",
    "the uhecr production through the decay of shdm shows three basic signatures that can be used to test the model :    * shdm particles , as any dm candidate , are clustered by gravitational interaction and accumulated in the halo of our galaxy with a typical over - density of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "hence the uhecr spectrum from shdm can overcome the constrain of the gzk steepening @xcite .",
    "* in the decay of x - particles pions are extensively produced @xcite , therefore uhe neutrinos and photons are the dominant component of the primary flux @xcite . * the non - central position of the sun in the galactic halo results in an anisotropic flux of uhecr observed on earth @xcite .    the photons ( and neutrinos ) dominated flux expected from shdm is one of the most striking predictions of the model .",
    "recently , the expected shdm photon flux at energies @xmath18 ev was compared with the photon fraction in the agasa events @xcite : this fraction was determined by different groups with different results , being around @xmath19 in @xcite and higher @xmath20 in @xcite .",
    "another important analysis on the photon content in uhecr events was recently published by the auger collaboration @xcite . from this analysis ,",
    "performed at the highest ( @xmath21 ev ) energies , follows a stringent limit on the photon fraction that is around @xmath22 at @xmath23 ev and below @xmath24 at @xmath1 ev @xcite .",
    "as recently discussed in @xcite , these limits do not exclude , but disfavor , the shdm hypothesis for the explanation of the observed uhecr spectrum , in the next section we will come back to the expected photon fraction in shdm models .",
    "the second most important signature of uhecr production by shdm is the peculiar anisotropy expected .",
    "this anisotropy in the flux is guaranteed by our position respect to the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "in particular , the distance between the sun and the outer boundary of the galaxy is larger in the gc direction respect to the anti - center direction . in order to evaluate the expected anisotropy",
    "it is necessary to assume a particular distribution of shdm in the galaxy : in this respect numerical simulations of the galactic dm distribution show an increase of the dm density towards the gc as @xmath25 @xcite or @xmath26 @xcite , this further enhancing the expected anisotropy .",
    "already several authors have considered anisotropy computations , with reliable predictions of the expected signal in the highest energy part of the spectrum @xcite , where the shdm contribution can be dominant .",
    "the expected anisotropy was compared with the existing uhecr data taken in the northern hemisphere , this comparison reveals no contradiction between data and the predictions of the model @xcite,@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the detectors located in the southern hemisphere are able to observe the gc and are much more sensitive to the expected anisotropy : in this respect the data of the old sugar detector , in australia , are only marginally consistent with the predictions of the shdm model @xcite .",
    "the pierre auger observatory , due to its location in the southern emisphere and its large exposure , has a big potential for the detection of uhecr from the gc and the related anisotropy . in the present paper",
    "we will discuss such a potential , with particular attention to the lower energy region accessible to the detector , namely the range @xmath27 ev .",
    "at these energies the shdm contribution to the flux , being _ subdominant _",
    ", can be extracted from the data only using its peculiar anisotropy pattern .",
    "although _ subdominant _ , uhe particles coming from the decay of shdm are mainly photons that do not suffer any isotropization process by magnetic fields , while @xmath27 ev particles produced by astrophysical sources , being charged , are deflected by the galactic magnetic field @xcite showing a substantially isotropic flux . in this sense",
    ", the low energy data of the auger detector , with high statistics , can be used to shad light on the shdm hypothesis , being any observed anisotropy directly connected only with shdm .    in order to compute the extragalactic uhecr flux",
    "we have used the dip model , recently suggested to explain the behavior of uhecr at energies @xmath28 ev @xcite . in this model the observed uhecr flux in the energy range @xmath29 is explained as the effect of the combination of the adiabatic and pair - production energy losses suffered by protons interacting with the cmb field .",
    "this interpretation of the observed spectra ev are constituted by a mixture of extragalactic protons and heavy nuclei , with a flat injection spectrum @xmath30 , while , at lower energies @xmath31 ev uhecr have still a galactic origin @xcite . from the point of view of the shdm",
    "induced anisotropy the `` dip '' and `` mixed composition '' scenarios show similar features .",
    "] has important consequences mainly from the point of view of the origin and chemical composition of uhecr , implying that , already at energies @xmath28 ev , uhecr have an extragalactic origin and are mainly constituted by protons , with a steep injection spectrum @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : flux ] we will introduce the computation of the expected flux from shdm combining it with the extragalactic proton flux as in the dip model , discussing in particular the expected chemical composition at the auger observatory . in section [ sec : ani ]",
    "we will calculate the anisotropy of uhecr , referring our computation to the case of the auger detector .",
    "finally in section [ sec : concl ] we will conclude discussing our results .",
    "the first step to determine the uhecr flux produced in the decay of @xmath34 particles is the computation of the particles spectra . as it was already discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this evaluation is particularly important because it represents a direct signature of the production mechanism that , in principle , can be detected experimentally .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the mass of the decaying particle , @xmath35 , that represents the total cms energy @xmath36 in the decay , is in the range @xmath37 gev . from the point of view of elementary particle physics",
    "the x - particle decay proceeds in a way similar to the @xmath38 annihilation into hadrons , two or more off mass shell partons are produced initiating qcd cascades .",
    "the determination of the particles energy spectra produced in the x - particle decay requires the extension of the existing qcd calculations for parton cascade from the tev scale up to the @xmath35 energy scale .",
    "the first calculations proposed in literature used an analytical approach based on the limiting spectrum approximation @xcite or an extension of the herwig @xcite qcd monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite .",
    "more recently several papers appeared discussing the computation scheme involved in the shdm decay .",
    "these schemes are based on two different approaches : the dglap evolution equations @xcite and a susy - qcd mc approach generalized to the high energies involved in the decay @xcite .",
    "these computations predict quite accurately the secondary spectra from the x - particle decay and agree well with each other .",
    "their most important outcome , concerning uhecr physics , is a flat energy spectrum of the produced particles with a behavior that can be approximated as @xmath39 @xcite .    as already discussed in the introduction , an important signature of the shdm model",
    "is represented by the peculiar uhecr composition , with a photon dominated flux .",
    "the exact determination of the photon fraction in the expected spectra is another outcome of the computation schemes discussed above , the typical photon / nucleon fraction expected in the cascade is @xmath40 @xcite , being only weekly dependent on the energy .",
    "the uhecr emissivity produced by the decays of shdm in the halo of the galaxy can be simply written as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the energy spectrum ( fragmentation function ) of particles ( photons and protons ) produced by the shdm decay , and @xmath43 is the density of x - particles in the galaxy as function of the distance @xmath44 from the gc . in the present work",
    "we will assume that x - particles contribute to a substantial fraction of the galactic dm : therefore we will use the dm density as obtained by several numerical simulations .",
    "in particular we will use the navarro - frank - white ( nfw ) @xcite and moore @xcite dm density profiles @xmath45 with @xmath46 for the nfw and moore case respectively , and @xmath47 kpc as obtained in @xcite .",

    "the spectrum from shdm decays can explain only the highest energy events ( agasa excess ) .",
    "the continuos curve gives the spectrum of extragalactic protons ( assuming the dip model @xcite ) .",

    "therefore , the uhecr flux from the shdm decay will be    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the line of sight coordinate and @xmath53 is the distance to the boundary of the galactic halo in the @xmath50 direction @xmath54 where @xmath55 kpc is the radius of the galactic halo and @xmath56 kpc is the distance sun - gc .",
    "let us now introduce the extragalactic ( eg ) component of the uhecr flux .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we will use the dip model @xcite assuming an homogeneous distribution of sources and a proton dominated injection at the source . under these hypothesis",
    "the uhecr flux can be computed as @xmath57 where : @xmath58 represents the standard cosmology ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite ) ; @xmath61 is the number of particles injected at the source per unit volume and energy , being the best fit value in the dip model @xmath62 @xcite ; the generation energy @xmath63 is determined solving the losses equation @xmath64 with the initial condition @xmath65 @xcite ; the quantity @xmath66 can be computed following the recipe given in @xcite",
    ".    the total uhecr flux will be the sum of the two contributions : galactic ( from shdm ) and extragalactic ( from homogeneous distributed sources ) @xmath67    as it follows from equation ( [ flux1 ] ) the flux from shdm depends on two basic parameters : the x - particle life - time @xmath15 and mass @xmath35 . while the value of @xmath35 is directly connected with the production mechanism of shdm , its life - time can be regarded as a free parameter that should be fixed in order to fit the observed uhecr events .",
    "the most remarkable creation mechanism for shdm is gravitational production through time variable gravitational fields during the inflationary phase of the universe @xcite . in this case",
    "the mass @xmath35 fixes the present abundance of x - particles @xmath68 .",
    "assuming that shdm constitute a substantial fraction of the dm , one has @xmath69 and to provide @xmath70 , according to the wmap observations @xcite , the mass of the x - particles must be in the range @xmath71 gev . fixing the x - particle mass @xmath72 gev , in figure [ fig1 ]",

    "we have repeated the same computation of figure [ fig1 ] but in the case of the auger detector . in this case the observed flux @xcite is almost consistent with the gzk suppression , hence the shdm contribution to the flux is _ subdominant _ with a typical life - time of the order of @xmath73 y.     gev left panel , @xmath48 gev right panel ) .",

    "as in the case of the flux computation from the chemical composition analysis , we can conclude that , although disfavored , the shdm hypothesis is not ruled out by the available observations .",
    "let us conclude this section discussing the extragalactic contribution to the flux due to shdm .",
    "the dominant photon component of this flux is absorbed by the intergalactic medium , it is completely converted in electromagnetic cascades in a few mpc , see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the charged component ( protons ) suffers the interaction with cmb giving rise , at the highest energies , to the photo - pion production process .",
    "these interactions deplete the high energy flux of the charged extragalactic shdm contribution , making such flux vanishingly small if compared with the corresponding astrophysical and galactic fluxes .",
    "for this reason we have neglected any extragalactic contribution to the shdm flux .",
    "the anisotropy in the direction of the gc is another important prediction of the shdm model for the production of uhecr . in particular , being the shdm distributed in our galactic halo with a spherical symmetry around the gc , a pure dipole deviation from isotropy might be expected with the dipole vector pointing toward the gc itself .    independently of the top - down scenario , an anisotropy in the arrival directions of uhecr",
    "is also expected due to the cosmological compton - getting effect @xcite . at energies @xmath28 ev the uhecr flux is dominated by sources at cosmological distances , the movement of the galaxy with respect to the cmb induces an anisotropy at 0.6% level , in any case smaller than the signals we will discuss here .",

    "the basic signatures of the shdm model for the uhecr production are a flat injection spectrum @xmath137 , a photon ( and neutrino ) dominated flux and an anisotropy due to the off - center position of the earth in the galaxy . in the present paper we have analyzed both the chemical composition and anisotropy expected at the auger observatory , our basic findings can be summarized as follows .    * the observed auger spectrum is still compatible with a _ subdominant _ contribution from shdm with a typical life - time of @xmath138 y. * the chemical composition observed by auger , with a photon limit around @xmath22 at @xmath23 ev , is still compatible with the chemical composition expected in the shdm model , that shows a photon content of the spectrum at the level of few @xmath128 at @xmath23 ev . * the anisotropy expected by shdm can be detected by the auger observatory and , even at the lowest energies , can be measured with a good accuracy .",
    "the anisotropy signal obtained in the present evaluation is of particular importance because it shows that already at low energy the shdm hypothesis can be tested . at the lowest auger energies",
    "@xmath139 ev the charged component of the uhecr flux is isotropized by the galactic magnetic field while the photon dominated flux from shdm does not .",
    "this is an important result connecting , at low energy , any observed anisotropy in the flux to the shdm component . in the present paper we have performed a detailed computation of the expected anisotropy signal at auger , showing how this signal is within reach of the auger capabilities .",
    "finally , at the highest energies , the anisotropy amplitude computed here should be regarded as an upper limit ( see the discussion in section [ sec : ani ] ) .",
    "therefore , the lack of detection by auger in 5 or 7 years of full operation would not discard the shdm hypothesis and , probably , a very large aperture new generation experiment will be needed to settle down the question about uhecr produced by the decay of shdm .",
    "we are grateful to v. berezinsky for joint work on the present paper , we also thank p. blasi for valuable discussions and p. ghia for her collaboration in anisotropy computations . the present work is partly funded by asi through the contract asi - inaf i/088/06/0 on high energy astrophysics .",
