    "this latter measure , of course , is the limiting pair correlation measure associated to the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "there is nothing special about our use of the function @xmath50 here .",
    "its placement serves only to cutoff measures and so they are ( close to being ) supported in a square region with dimensions of order @xmath51 .",
    "this is an important feature of montgomery s conjecture  outside of this region the random - matrix - theory measure given by ceases to be as good an approximation to .    even inside this region ",
    "to which we will restrict our attention in this paper  the measure misses important phenomena that will be important if we are to achieve a stronger estimate than .",
    "these are the troughs near low - lying zeroes in histograms of @xmath52 , seen in figure [ data ] .    because the 1-level density of zeroes near @xmath12 is not stationary but grows like @xmath53 , measure will even more closely resemble measure if the average from @xmath28 to @xmath12 is replaced by an average from @xmath12 to @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "we will do so in the sequel , and in addition , for technical reasons , we will use smoothed averages ; we replace @xmath56}\\big(\\tfrac{t - t}{h}\\big)\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot \\,dt\\ ] ] by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is some smooth bump function with mass @xmath59 . making use of such smoothed averages",

    "the reason we have written our error terms in this manner is that the second error term @xmath73 is somewhat artificial .",
    "this will become clear in the proof ; at the cost of a somewhat more baroque result it could be eliminated .",
    "the remaining error term is somewhat more fundamental  and at any rate both effectively amount to an inverse power - of-@xmath12 error term .    _",
    "remark : _ here and in what follows we adopt the convention of counting zeroes with multiplicity , so that in particular for a function @xmath14 , a sum @xmath74 is really @xmath75 in all likelihood every zero of the zeta function occurs with multiplicity @xmath59 , but provided we adopt this notational convention we do not need to assume so .    _",
    "remark : _ this theorem is of interest mainly in the case that @xmath76 , as in conjecture [ spc ] .",
    "we do not specialize to this case only because in the computation of higher order correlation functions such a specialization ceases to be as natural",
    ".    a pair correlation function of this form was first conjectured by bogomolny and keating in @xcite , on part on an analogy from the field of quantum chaos .",
    "further support for this form was offered by conrey and snaith @xcite , who showed that it can be derived from the ratio conjecture of conrey , farmer , and zirnbauer @xcite .",
    "it bears remarking that , in the semiclassical language , we shall only really see the diagonal terms @xmath77 and conjugate because of the restrictions we place on @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , apart from some analytic devices which mimic the large sieve , we recover these terms in much the same fashion as bogomolny and keating .",
    "there are no new arithmetical ideas required ; to rigorously extend the range in which @xmath78 lie and effectively see the off - diagonal terms that remain is more difficult and will almost certainly require a breakthrough .    by re - averaging theorem [ main ] in @xmath12 , and using a 1-level density estimate as before , we show that    [ 4corr ] for fixed @xmath30 and fixed @xmath79 with a smooth and compactly supported fourier transform , @xmath80\\,du \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any @xmath81 , uniformly for @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , by proceeding carefully in the analysis that follows , one can show this even for montgomery s choice of test function @xmath83 , owing to the rapid decrease of this function s fourier transform .",
    "we leave this refined computation to the reader .",
    "that the integral on the right extends over all of @xmath84 , rather than simply @xmath85 $ ] may seem surprising since from the left hand side we inherit only information about @xmath79 in the latter interval , but the decay of @xmath79 is in all cases sufficient that the difference between these two regions of integration is absorbed into the error term .",
    "the sum over zeroes in is of the same form as that in the strong pair correlation conjecture s .",
    "( should we push our analysis to include @xmath86 , they would be the same sum . )",
    "our result therefore refines montgomery s original work .",
    "indeed , one can show that the difference between this prediction and a somewhat naive extension of the gue prediction in which @xmath87 has been replaced by @xmath88 where @xmath89 , is larger than the error term .",
    "we conclude our paper with a demonstration of the difference between these two predictions .    for @xmath27",
    "not restricted so stringently : there is no reason not to believe that for any fixed compact region @xmath22 , theorem [ 4corr ] is true for all @xmath90 for any @xmath91 .    _",
    "remark : _ by integrating in @xmath27 in theorem [ 4corr ] , one can see the statistics @xmath92 to a uniform error of @xmath93 for any @xmath94 , where @xmath14 is supported in @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 .",
    "this is the precise sense in which one can see the troughs in the pair correlation measure .",
    "if one wants these statistics only for fixed @xmath94 , without uniformity , the computations that follow can be simplified slightly .",
    "_ remark : _ the above statistics say nothing about the case that our macroscopic interval grows .",
    "for instance , they say nothing about the sums @xmath97 when @xmath98 .",
    "the statistics over such intervals would be expected to deviate from gue statistics in the same way as above , and bear relevance to the variance statistics first obtained by fujii @xcite for the number of zeroes lying in an interval @xmath99 $ ] , where @xmath100 as @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , using the method below , one can evaluate the sums to a high degree of accuracy , at the cost of imposing additional band - limits on the fourier variable @xmath27 , beyond those of theorems [ main ] and [ 4corr ] .",
    "however , we do not pursue the matter here .",
    "our main tool in establishing this will be the well known explicit formula relating the zeroes of the zeta function to the primes .",

    "@xmath118 it is therefore clear in this formulation that the explicit formula expresses a fourier duality between the error term in the prime number theorem and the error term of the zero - counting function .",

    "because we do not expect that @xmath129 to correlate at a local scale with @xmath130 , to understand the pair correlation statistics @xmath131 it is enough to understand those of @xmath132 .",
