    "a domain wall in a @xmath1-dimensional spacetime is an extended object with @xmath2 spatial dimensions which partitions the spacetime into different domains . in cosmology",
    ", the different domains might correspond to different vacua of some higgs field .",
    "we will use the term `` domain wall '' loosely to refer to any @xmath0-brane moving in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "when the gravitational back - reaction of a domain wall is included , the global causal structure of the resulting spacetime is usually modified . in the simplest models ,",
    "one considers domain walls which do not couple to any bulk fields with the domain wall world volume governed by a nambu - goto action s_dw = -_d^d-1x where @xmath3 is a parameter which corresponds to the tension or energy density of the wall , @xmath4 denotes the world volume swept out by the wall and @xmath5 denotes the determinant of the world volume metric .",
    "more precisely , the stress - energy tensor @xmath6 of the domain wall takes the simple form t_mn=(x)(1,-1,  ,-1,0 ) , where @xmath7 is the direction transverse to the wall .",
    "this stress - energy tensor is a distributional source for the einstein equations : the metric is at most @xmath8 as we move across such a `` thin wall '' of energy density .",
    "one approach to understanding the gravitational field of such an object is to divide the spacetime into smooth domains , where each domain is bounded by a domain wall .",
    "if we vary the metric to obtain the equations of motion then we obtain the well - known _ israel matching conditions _",
    "@xcite : [ eqn : is ] \\{k_mn - kh_mn}=8gh_mn , where @xmath9 is the induced metric on the domain wall , @xmath10 its extrinsic curvature and @xmath11 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature is typically discontinuous across a domain wall ; the curly brackets denote summation over each side of the wall .",
    "we present a careful derivation of the israel conditions from the einstein - hilbert action in section [ sec : derive ] .",
    "the israel conditions are often used to study the motion of a domain wall in a static bulk spacetime .",
    "they are satisfied by seeking totally umbilic ( @xmath12 ) surfaces in the bulk , slicing along such a surface and then gluing to another such bulk .",
    "for example , domain walls between domains corresponding to different vacua of a higgs field can be obtained by taking the bulk spacetime to be flat @xcite or false vacuum decay can be studied by taking the two bulk portions to have differing cosmological constants @xcite .",
    "one can have a domain wall enclosing a bubble of true vacuum in a sea of false vacuum .",
    "the israel conditions reduce to two equations , one giving the velocity of the domain wall and the other its acceleration .",
    "consistency of these equations follows from the bulk einstein equations .",
    "if the domain wall action is of the nambu - goto form considered above then the energy density on the wall is fixed so there can be no transfer of energy between the bulk matter and the wall .",
    "however it is possible to consider more general situations in which matter is localised to the wall and energy can flow on or off the wall . in this case , the right hand side of equation [ eqn : is ] is replaced by the energy - momentum tensor of the wall matter . for simple static bulk solutions the israel conditions reduce to two equations , one relating the velocity of the wall to its energy density and the other relating its acceleration to its energy density and pressure .",
    "there is also an equation of state for the matter on the wall .",
    "thus there are three equations for three quantities ( position , energy density and pressure ) so one would expect a solution to exist without further restrictions on the bulk spacetime .",
    "this changes if the domain wall couples to matter in the bulk .",
    "for example , in string theory a brane or domain wall will usually be coupled to a dilaton @xmath13 - a bulk scalar field which measures the scale or deformation properties of some internal manifold .",
    "the simple nambu - goto form for the world volume action is replaced by an action of the form s_dw = -_d^d-1x ( ) , where the wall tension @xmath14 depends on the value of the dilaton on the wall .",
    "if the domain wall moves through regions of varying dilaton then energy will flow on or off the wall .",
    "if one attempts to find solutions for the domain wall motion as before then one encounters a problem .",
    "once again there are three equations for three quantities but now the energy density and pressure on the wall are specified by its position in the bulk . hence there is no guarantee that a solution will exist for the motion of the wall in a static bulk spacetime : in general the motion of the domain wall will make the bulk time dependent .",
    "studying dynamics in this model is hard because the bulk metric will depend on two parameters ( time and distance from the wall ) so the einstein equations become more difficult to solve .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the circumstances under which it _ is _",
    "possible for a domain wall coupled to bulk matter to move in a static bulk .",
    "starting from a static ansatz for the bulk metric we find in section [ sec : israel ] that consistency of the israel equations requires that the bulk metric and matter be related in a certain way .",
    "this can be used to find solutions of the bulk einstein equations .",
    "we concentrate on the example of a bulk dilaton with liouville potentials in the bulk and on the domain wall .",
    "this model can be motivated by massive supergravity theories and p - brane world volume actions .",
    "domain walls in such models have been extensively studied for static bulk spacetimes @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) , especially in the supersymmetric case @xcite .",
    "however all of these solutions assume a constant dilaton on the domain wall whereas in our solutions the dilaton evolves in time on the wall .",
    "our bulk solutions are described in section [ sec : bulk ] .",
    "all are singular but in some cases the singularity is hidden behind a horizon .",
    "some have cosmological horizons beyond which the metric becomes time dependent .",
    "the motion of the domain wall can be followed across the horizon so some of our solutions describe the evolution of a domain wall in a cosmological background .",
    "there has been recent interest in cosmological models in which our universe is viewed as a brane moving in a higher dimensional spacetime , possibly with a very low fundamental planck scale and consequently large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "a topic of particular interest in this scenario is how inflation occurs on the brane .",
    "in @xcite it was concluded that for a viable model the bulk must be non - static during inflation .",
    "however in this model inflation was assumed to be driven by a scalar field restricted to the brane world volume and the possibility of the energy density on the brane coming from a bulk field was not discussed . in @xcite",
    "it was described how inflation can occur if one of a stack of branes is displaced from the others . in the case of a stack of d - branes , the energy density that drives world volume inflation arises from the energy of open strings stretched between the branes .",
    "this energy can be viewed as coming from the non - zero expectation value of a world volume higgs field .",
    "inflation was discussed in @xcite where the bulk spacetime was assumed to be non - static but the gravitational back reaction of the domain wall was treated in an approximate manner that did nt correspond to a wall localized in the extra dimensions . in @xcite solutions",
    "were given for localized domain walls with inflation driven by matter living on the wall .",
    "our model can be used to study inflation driven by energy density on the domain wall coming from a bulk field , taking full account of the gravitational back reaction of the wall .",
    "we find in section [ sec : results ] that power law inflation can occur on the domain wall provided that the potential on the world volume is not too steep . in some cases inflation",
    "occurs because the domain wall is comoving with an inflationary bulk while in others it occurs because the domain wall moves relative to the bulk .    in section",
    "[ sec : higherdim ] we show that for some values of the parameters our model can be obtained by dimensional reduction of a nambu - goto domain wall moving in a bulk spacetime with a cosmological constant .",
    "the world volumes of these domain walls undergo exponential inflation , which gives the power law inflation described above in the dimensionally reduced theory .",
    "cosmological solutions of hoava - witten theory , the strongly coupled limit of the @xmath15 heterotic superstring theory , have been recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "the orbifold fixed planes in this theory can be viewed as domain walls so our method is well suited to finding new solutions .",
    "we discuss these in section [ sec : hw ] .    in section [ sec :",
    "conclude ] we discuss our conclusions and speculate on possible generalisations and applications of our work to cosmology and the dynamics of branes in string theory .",

    "we include a contribution to the action s_gh=-__d^d-1x k , where @xmath24 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of @xmath18 i.e. @xmath11 , @xmath25 .",
    "we now have to compute the variation of this new term .",
    "this is slightly complicated by the fact that @xmath19 depends on the metric because it is normalised to unit length . when the metric is varied , the change in @xmath19 is n_m= n_m n^p n^q g_pq .",
    "the variation in @xmath24 is k =- k^mng_mn - h^mnn^p(_m g_np - _ p g_mn ) + k n^pn^qg_pq , and the variation of the gibbons - hawking term is s_gh=-__d^d-1x ( k + k h^mng_mn ) . note that @xmath26 contains a term @xmath27 , which cancels the corresponding normal derivative in the variation of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the total variation is [ eqn : deltas ] s_eh+s_gh & = & _ _ d^d-1x .    to proceed",

    "the stress energy tensor @xmath33 on the domain wall is not necessarily conserved because energy can flow between the domain wall and the bulk .",
    "this can be seen by taking the divergence of the israel equations : |_m t^mn=-\\{|_m k^mn - h^mn|_m k}. the right hand side can be evaluated using codacci s equation @xcite , giving [ eqn : cons ] |_m t^mn & = & -\\{h^nmr_mpn^p } + & = & -\\{h^nmt_mpn^p } , where @xmath34 is the bulk energy momentum tensor and we have made use of the bulk einstein equation .",

    "<S> motivated by the `` universe as a brane '' idea , we investigate the motion of a @xmath0-brane ( or domain wall ) that couples to bulk matter . </S>",
    "<S> usually one would expect the spacetime outside such a wall to be time dependent however we show that in certain cases it can be static , with consistency of the israel equations yielding relationships between the bulk metric and matter that can be used as anstze to solve the einstein equations . as a concrete model we study a domain wall coupled to a bulk dilaton with liouville potentials for the dilaton both in the bulk and on the wall . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk solutions we find are all singular . </S>",
    "<S> some have black hole or cosmological horizons , beyond which our solutions describe domain walls moving in time dependent bulks . a significant period of world volume inflation </S>",
    "<S> occurs if the potential on the wall is not too steep ; in some cases the bulk also inflates ( with the wall comoving ) while in others the wall moves relative to a non - inflating bulk . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our method to obtain cosmological solutions of hoava - witten theory compactified on a calabi - yau space . </S>"
