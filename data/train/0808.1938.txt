    "as unveiled by the remarkable suppression of fluorescence , coherent population trapping ( cpt )  @xcite has been regarded as a significant demonstration of macroscopic quantum coherence and interference .",
    "the importance of cpt is well illuminated by its numerous applications in laser cooling , stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite , and lasing without inversion ( lwi )  @xcite .",
    "recent studies even extend the concept of cpt beyond optics to the realm of electron transportation in coupled quantum dots , where an all - electronic analogy of cpt emerges with potential values for current rectification  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "cpt is realized within a driven @xmath0-type atom , in which a _ dark state _ is prepared via the field - induced coherent superposition of the two lower atomic states .",
    "the mixing ratio of this superposition is self - adjusted to have the two transition paths from the lower states to the upper state interfere destructively , so that excitation to the upper state is forbidden .",
    "therefore , suppression of fluorescence from the upper state results in a striking darkline at the vicinity of two - photon resonance  @xcite .",
    "since cpt by its nature relies on the coherence between the two lower atomic states , it is vulnerable to any mechanism which may destroy this coherence .",
    "for this reason , cpt is predominantly studied in bare @xmath0-type atoms with negligible spontaneous transition between the two lower states .    in many cases",
    "the dressed - atom picture provides a unique insight in dealing with atom - photon interaction problems  .",
    "a well - known example is the rabi splitting of a monochromatically driven two - level atom ( tla ) , where the rabi doublet can be well treated as eigenstates of the ( semiclasical ) atom - field interaction hamiltonian , i.e. , _ dressed states _ ( dss ) . when driving field is modeled quantum - mechanically , a ladder of such dressed - state doublets ( dsds ) emerges with quasi - equidistant energy spacing between adjacent dsds .",
    "coherent transition between dss within each dsd is forbidden due to vanishing dipole moment  @xcite . to induce coherence in the ds basis",
    "one needs to couple adjacent dsds , where transitions are allowed between dss associated with different dsds  @xcite .",
    "such coherent transitions between dss result in an interesting spectral signature of the underlying atom - field interation , and novel effects such as spectral cancellation of spontaneous emission can be realized ( see , the _ doubly dressed - atom _ in  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , we show in this paper that it is also possible to achieve a cpt - like coherence _ within _ each dsd , via a bichromatic field which couples the two dss to an auxiliary atomic state .",
    "we show that such a dressed - state coherent population trapping ( dscpt ) is formed in analogy to the conventional cpt in bare atomic basis .",
    "as expected , the occurence of such dscpt is reflected in a sharp suppression of fluorescence from the auxiliary state .",
    "our analytical and numerical studies show that the efficiency of dscpt is limited by its rate of decoherence , i.e. , the rate of spontaneous decay of the tla ( see section  [ sec:2 ] for details ) .",
    "practically , dscpt can be viewed as a new doorknob to manipulate a tla due to its ability to control the ds populations .",
    "application of dscpt in the autler - townes spectroscopy leads to an enhanced precision in the measurement of rabi frequency .",
    "dscpt can also be used to obtain an unexpected population inversion for a driven tla , where the previously reported _ dynamically induced irreversibility _",
    "@xcite can be treated as a limiting case within this context , which provides us a new picture in understanding the origin of this phenomenon .",
    "additionally , novel lwi effects with and without hidden inversion are also presented to demonstrate the versatile controllability provided by dscpt ( see section  [ sec:3 ] for details ) .",
    "we wish to emphasize that dscpt is different from the cpt investigated in a degenerate two - level atom ( dtla )  @xcite , where effects of zeeman sublevels are investigated . in a dtla",
    ", sublevels of the ground ( excited ) level do not contain any contamination from the excited ( ground ) level , with or without external magnetic field . while in a coherently driven tla",
    ", each ds is a coherent mixing of the ground state and the excited state .",
    "therefore , the coherence between dss discussed here intrinsically differs from that studied in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] , we introduce the theoretical model and provide both analytical and numerical investigation of dscpt . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we demonstrate the application of dscpt via three examples .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in section  [ sec:4 ] .",

    "thus we can define two detunings @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the rabi frequencies associated with the two atomic transitions can be written as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19(@xmath20 ) denotes the dipole moment of the @xmath21 ( @xmath8 ) transition .",

    "first let us look at the system as if @xmath1 is absent .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath3 plus @xmath31 transition correspond to a standard driven tla  @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical dss are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( in the rotating - wave frame , @xmath32 ) @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . and the corresponding eigenenergies are @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being the the rabi - splitting .",
    "( we emphasize that both the ground state @xmath40 and the upper state @xmath41 are splitted into doublet via the atom - field interaction . without specific notation ,",

    "meanwhile , the quantum mechanical dss are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44where @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 being the fock state of the field and the coupling strength between the field and the atom , respectively .",
    "since the classical field @xmath3 is not in a pure fock state @xmath48 but a coherent state with average photon number @xmath49 , the correspondence between semiclassical rabi frequency and the field s photon number leads to @xmath50 .    to achieve cpt in the above ds basis one needs to construct an effective @xmath0-type atom",
    "this can be fulfilled by introducing the bichromatic field @xmath1 , whose center frequency is ( near ) resonant with @xmath7 transition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the two transitions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are then coupled by the two frequency components @xmath53 and @xmath54 of @xmath1 , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . since both @xmath55 and @xmath5",

    "accordingly , the hamiltonian of the effective @xmath0-type atom in fig .  [ fig1](b ) can be written as @xmath64\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\delta\\vert\\widetilde 1\\rangle\\langle\\widetilde 1\\vert+ \\delta_{\\rm 2photon}\\vert\\widetilde s\\rangle\\langle\\widetilde s\\vert,\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",

    "once eq.([eq.2photon ] ) is satisfied , it is routine to show that both dark and bright states exist in this effective @xmath0-type atom .",
    "we adopt the terminology in  @xcite , i.e. , the noncoupled and coupled states , which are defined as @xmath74and @xmath75where @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath77 , an atom in the noncoupled state @xmath78 can not be excited to @xmath79 by absorbing @xmath1 photons . on the other hand , since @xmath80 , there is nonzero probability for an atom in the coupled state @xmath81 to be excited to @xmath79 .",
    "in contrast to the excitation paths , the spontaneous decay processes for @xmath82 and @xmath83 do not contain such a clear - cut asymmetry .",
    "the decay rates associated with @xmath83 and @xmath84 are proportional to the square of their corresponding dipole moments , i.e. , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 take @xmath87 as an example , for which @xmath88 , it is clear that one pump - decay cycle @xmath89 will transfer half of the population of @xmath90 into @xmath91 .",
    "after several pump - decay cycles , most atomic population will be trapped in @xmath92 , i.e. , dscpt is obtained .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath92 itself is not radiatively stable , due to the spontaneous decay from @xmath93 to @xmath94 . to demonstrate this",
    "more explicitly we resort to the fully - quantized correspondence of the semiclassical noncoupled state @xmath92 , i.e. , @xmath95as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath96 and @xmath97 spontaneously decay to the next low - lying doublet composed of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , by emitting a reservoir photon whose frequency is centered at @xmath10 .",
    "each spontaneous emission event ( quantum jump ) completely destroys the coherence of @xmath100 , so that the decoherence rate of @xmath100 is equivalent to the frequency of occurrence of such quantum jumps , i.e. , the spontaneous decay rate @xmath26 of state @xmath93 . nevertheless ,",
    "if @xmath101 and @xmath102 , then after each @xmath103 quantum jump , the ds coherence will be quickly reestablished in @xmath104 within a time scale much smaller than the average time interval between two successive quantum jumps . in this sense @xmath92",

    "in this section we provide three examples on the application of dscpt . throughout the discussions we refer a driven tla to the subsystem composed of transition @xmath182 and field @xmath3 .",
    "the dscpt via inclusion of state @xmath183 and field @xmath1 is thus viewed as an artificial control over the driven tla .",
    "moreover , all relevant parameters are normalized with respect to @xmath25 as in the previous section .",
    "the absolute rabi frequency is the product of the field strength and the associated atomic dipole moment .",
    "knowing either one , the measurement of rabi frequency reveals the other .",
    "thus the precision measurement of rabi frequency is of great importance in laser and atomic spectroscopy .",
    "the usual measurement of rabi frequency invokes the autler - townes ( at ) spectroscopy , in which the rabi splitting of a resonantly driven tla is probed by a second _ monochromatic _ field which couples the ground state @xmath184 to a probe state @xmath183 .",
    "the variation of the fluorescence intensity from @xmath79 with respect to the detuning of the probe field reveals an at doublet .",
    "spectroscopic measurement of the frequency splitting of the at doublet directly gives the rabi frequency @xmath30 .",
    "the weakness of this conventional setup lies in that each absorption peak of the at doublet possesses an intrinsic linewidth ( for , e.g. , @xmath185 ) @xmath186which obviously depends on the spectral width of state @xmath187 .",
    "this means that the introduction of a probe state inevitably produces an additional measuring error @xmath25 . as far as monochromatic probe field",
    "is concerned , this error is unremovable and the only way to reduce it is to choose a probe state with a longer lifetime , which on the other hand leads to a longer photon collection time and therefore deteriorates the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "however , by using a _ bichromatic _ probe field as described in the previous discussion of dscpt , the above difficulty can be circumvented .",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath30 can be alternatively measured through the internal frequency difference of the bichromatic probe field , since the position of fluorescence darkline ( as shown in fig.2 ) corresponds to the equality @xmath188 . because the width of the dark resonance is independent of @xmath25",
    ", @xmath30 can be measured with a precision invulnerable to the choice of the probe state .",
    "although this precision is still plagued by the @xmath1 field - induced power broadening , it can be made sufficiently smaller than @xmath25 by reducing the intensity of the bichromatic field @xmath1 to satisfy @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , this method would be superior to the conventional at spectroscopy whenever the spectral width of the probe state is much larger than that of the atomic transition to be measured .",
    "it is well known that no steady - state population inversion exists for a driven tla  @xcite .",
    "sustained population inversion can be realized in multi - level atoms where irreversible population transfer channels between excited states come into play .",
    "for example , if an additional @xmath190 decay channel is open for the v - type atom shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , a steady - state inversion on the @xmath191 transition can be achieved with appropriate parameter setup . however , even when no such decay channel is available , artificial population transfer in the ds basis can still lead to an unexpected inversion for the @xmath192 transition , which is termed as _ dynamically - induced irreversibility _ by meduri _",
    "et al _  @xcite . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we have seen that with ideal dscpt ( @xmath193 ) the atomic population is trapped in the dark state @xmath92 , thus the mixing angle @xmath194 provides an independent doorknob on the ds populations .",
    "next we show that the unexpected inversion can be realized via dscpt as well , and the results in  @xcite can be viewed as a limiting case of this method .",
    "as shown in a rate - equation approach  @xcite , the ds populations of a monochromatically driven tla obey @xmath195which leads to @xmath196 because @xmath197 , i.e. , the ds population is always non - inverted .",
    "furthermore , from eq.([eq.ds.semi ] ) one finds @xmath198 due to the nonnegativity of @xmath199 , a ds inversion always corresponds to a bare atomic inversion except at @xmath200 .",
    "such connection between ds inversion and bare atomic inversion is the key factor in achieving unexpected inversion .    when state @xmath183 and field @xmath1 are included , equality ( [ eq.dspop ] )",
