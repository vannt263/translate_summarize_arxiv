    "although the full details of string / m - theory have yet to be unraveled , this theoretical effort has inspired a number of ideas over the years which have had significant impact on the phenomenology of particle physics .",
    "two such examples are given by the string - inspired @xmath6 models of the late 1980s@xcite and the ongoing endeavor in building realistic and testable models from theories which have additional space - time dimensions@xcite .",
    "most recently , a resurgence of interest in non - commutative quantum field theory ( ncqft ) and its applications@xcite has developed within the context of string theory .",
    "of course non - commutative theories are also interesting in their own right .",
    "however , it has yet to be explored whether they have any connection with the physics of the standard model ( sm ) or whether their effects could be observable in laboratory experiments .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to begin to address these questions .",
    "an exhaustive introduction to ncqft is beyond the scope of the present treatment , hence we will simply outline some of the basics of the theory as well as some results which are relevant to the phenomenological analysis that follows .",
    "we will see that ncqft results in modifications to qed which can be probed in @xmath0 processes in  collisions .",
    "the essential idea of ncqft is a generalization of the usual d - dimensional space , @xmath7 , associated with commuting space - time coordinates to one which is non - commuting , @xmath8 .",
    "in such a space the conventional coordinates are represented by operators which no longer commute , , @xmath9=i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}\\equiv { i\\over { \\lambda_{nc}^2}}c_{\\mu\\nu}\\,.\\ ] ] in the last equality we have parameterized the effect in terms of an overall scale @xmath10 , which characterizes the threshold where non - commutative ( nc ) effects become relevant , and a real antisymmetric matrix @xmath11 , whose dimensionless elements are presumably of order unity . from our point of view",
    "the role of the nc scale @xmath10 can be compared to that of @xmath12 in conventional quantum mechanics which represents the level of non - commutativity between coordinates and momenta . _ a priori _ the scale @xmath10 can take any value , perhaps the most likely being of order the planck scale .",
    "however , given the possibility@xcite of the onset of stringy effects at the tev scale , and that values of the scale where gravity becomes strong in models with large extra dimensions can be of order a tev , it is feasible that nc effects could also set in at a tev . here , we adopt this spirit and consider the possibility that @xmath10 may not lie far above the tev scale .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath11 is _ not _ a tensor since its elements are identical in all reference frames .",
    "this leads immediately to a violation of lorentz invariance which is quite different than that discussed most often in the literature@xcite since it sets in only at energies of order @xmath10 . as we will see below",
    ", this violation will take the form of dimension-8 operators for the processes we consider and is thus highly suppressed at low energies .",
    "in addition , there exists a more than superficial relation between the anti - symmetric matrix @xmath11 and the maxwell field strength tensor @xmath13 as ncqft arises in string theory@xcite through the quantization of strings , described by the low energy excitations of d - branes in the presence of background electromagnetic fields .",
    "the space - time components , @xmath14 , thus define the direction of a background * e * field , while the space - space components , @xmath15 , describe the direction of a background magnetic or string * b * field .",
    "geometrically , we can then think of @xmath14 and @xmath15 as two 3-vectors that point in a specific pair of preferred directions in the laboratory frame .",
    "theories with @xmath16 are usually referred to as space - time(space - space ) non - commutative .",
    "ncqft can be phrased in terms of conventional commuting qft through the application of the weyl - moyal correspondence@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents a quantum field with @xmath19 being the set of non - commuting coordinates and @xmath20 corresponding to the commuting set . however , in formulating ncqft , one must be careful to preserve orderings in expressions such as @xmath21 .",
    "this is accomplished with the introduction of a star product , @xmath22 , where the effect of the commutation relation is absorbed into the star . making the fourier",
    "transform pair @xmath23 with @xmath20 and @xmath24 being real n - dimensional variables , allows us to write the product of two fields as @xmath25}a(\\alpha)b(\\beta)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we thus have the correspondence @xmath26 provided we identify @xmath27_{\\zeta=\\eta=0}\\,.\\ ] ] note that to leading order in @xmath28 the @xmath29 product is given by @xmath30 hence the non - commutative version of an action for a quantum field theory can be obtained from the ordinary one by replacing the products of fields by star products . in doing",
    "so it is useful to define a generalized commutator , known as the moyal bracket , for two quantities @xmath31 as @xmath32_{mb}=s*t - t*s\\,,\\ ] ] so that the moyal bracket of any quantity with itself vanishes .",
    "note that the integration of a moyal bracket of two quantities over all space - time vanishes , , @xmath33_{mb}=0\\,,\\ ] ] which means they commute inside the integral .",
    "this can be generalized to show that the integral of a @xmath29 product of an arbitrary number of quantities is invariant under cyclic permutations in a manner similar to the trace of ordinary matrices .",
    "we also note that the moyal bracket of two coordinates @xmath34_{mb}=x_\\mu*x_\\nu - x_\\nu*x_\\mu\\,,\\ ] ] mimics the operator commutation relation in eq .",
    "once the products of fields are replaced by @xmath29 products , infinite numbers of derivatives of fields can now appear in an action , implying that all such theories are non - local .",
    "this is not surprising since , in analogy with ordinary quantum mechanics , one now has a spacetime uncertainty relation @xmath35 theories with @xmath36 have an additional problematic feature in that they generally do not have a unitary @xmath37-matrix@xcite , at least in perturbation theory , since an infinite number of time derivatives are involved in @xmath29 products .",
    "however , it has recently been shown@xcite that it may be possible to unitarize the space - time case by combining the spacial nc super yang mills limit with a lorentz transformation with finite boost velocity .",
    "on the other hand , theories with only space - space non - commutativity , @xmath38 , are unitary .",
    "there are a number of important results in ncqft which we now state without proof , referring the interested reader to the original papers for detailed explanations .",
    "( @xmath39 ) matsubara@xcite has shown that only the @xmath40 matrix lie algebra is closed under the moyal bracket , thus non - commutative gauge theories can be constructed only if they are based upon these gauge groups . hence in order to embed the full sm in ncqft , the usual standard model @xmath41 group factors must be extended to @xmath40 groups . however , due to the effective non - abelian nature of the moyal brackets , these @xmath40 groups can not be simply decomposed into products of @xmath41 and @xmath42 factors .",
    "( @xmath43 ) there are indications that conventional renormalizable , gauge invariant field theories remain renormalizable and gauge invariant when generalized to non - commutative spacetimes@xcite , although a proof does not yet exist for theories which are spontaneously broken@xcite .",
    "( @xmath44 ) non - commutative qed , based on the group @xmath42 , has been studied by several groups@xcite ; due to the presence of @xmath29 products and moyal brackets , the theory takes on a non - abelian nature in that both 3-point and 4-point photon couplings are generated .",
    "the photonic part of the action is now @xmath45 where the second equality follows from the commutativity of moyal brackets under integration , shown in eq .",
    "this action is gauge invariant under a local transformation @xmath46 with @xmath13 defined as @xmath47_{mb}\\,.\\ ] ] the origin of the 3- and 4-point functions is now readily transparent .",
    "note that the photon s 2-point function is identical in commutative and nc spaces because quadratic forms remain unchanged . when performing the fourier transformation of these new interactions into momentum space",
    ", the vertices pick up additional phase factors which are dependent upon the momenta flowing through the vertices .",
    "we will see below that these kinematic phases will play an important role in the collider tests of ncqft .",
    "( @xmath48 ) when fermions are added to the theory , covariant derivatives can only be constructed for fields of charge @xmath49 .",
    "the structure of those derivatives for the @xmath50 case is similar to that for fundamental and anti - fundamental representations in non - abelian theories .",
    "the covariant derivatives for neutral fields are either trivial ( as in the case of abelian commutative @xmath42 theory ) or correspond to what would ordinarily be called the adjoint representation in the case of a commutative non - abelian theory . as before , the three - point function picks up an additional kinematic phase from the fourier transformation of the interaction term into momentum space .",
    "this is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ frules ] .",
    "the general form of the feynman rules for ncqed can be found in ref.@xcite ; the ones of relevance to the processes considered in this paper are displayed in fig .",
    "[ frules ] .",
    "( @xmath51 ) ncqed with fermions and space - space non - commutativity has been shown@xcite to be cp violating yet cpt conserving .",
    "having now presented the basic formalism of ncqft and subsequent modifications to qed , in the following sections we examine the effects in several @xmath0 processes in collisions , including pair annihilation , moller and bhabha scattering , as well as in @xmath1 scattering .",
    "we will see that the lowest order correction to the sm results for these transitions is given by dimension-8 operators .",
    "in addition , we find that an oscillatory azimuthal dependence is induced in these processes due to the preferred direction in the laboratory frame defined by the nc matrix @xmath11 . in summary , we will see that high energy linear colliders can probe non - commutative scales of order a tev .    before discussing our analysis for the specific processes considered here ,",
    "a few additional comments are in order regarding the observation of these non - commutative effects .",
    "first , as discussed above , the vectors @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 $ ] point in fixed specific directions which are the same in all reference frames . in our analysis below we define the @xmath54-axis as that corresponding to the direction of the incoming particles in a fixed laboratory frame with the vectors * c * having arbitrary components in that frame .",
    "now , imagine a second laboratory at a different point on the surface of the earth performing the same experiment .",
    "clearly the co - ordinate systems of the two laboratories will be different , , the beam directions and hence the @xmath54-axis will not be the same in the two locations .",
    "this implies that the experimentally determined values for the components of the * c * vectors will differ at the two laboratory sites due to their locally chosen set of co - ordinates .",
    "hence _ both _ laboratories must convert their local co - ordinates to a common frame , , with respect to the rest frame of the 3 degree k blackbody radiation or some other slowly varying astronomical co - ordinate system , so that they would measure equivalent directions and magnitudes for * c*. this translation of co - ordinates to a common frame will be necessary if we are to compare the results of multiple experiments for signals of non - commutativity .",
    "in addition , even for a single experiment , the apparent directions of the * c * vectors will vary with time due to the rotation of the earth and its revolution about the sun . while the actual * c * vectors will always point to the same position on the sky , the co - ordinates of this position will vary continuously in the laboratory frame due to the earth s motion .",
    "( the effects of galactic motion should be small during the life - span of any given experiment . )",
    "collider experiments will thus have to make use of astronometric techniques to continuously translate their laboratory co - ordinates to astronomical ones such that when events are recorded the relative orientation of the two frames would be accounted for .",
    "this should be a rather straightforward procedure for any future collider experiment to implement given that many non - accelerator based experiments already make use of these ideas .",
    "taking the earth s motion into account is particularly important for experiments which measure observable quantities that are odd in * c * , including for example , the @xmath55 of the muon@xcite , the lamb shift@xcite , as well as other processes which are linear@xcite in the nc parameter .",
    "if only the laboratory co - ordinates were employed , at least some of the components of * c * would average to zero over a sidereal day . in the cases we discuss below , the observables are even functions of * c * , and while we would not obtain a null effect , time averaging would result in a diminished sensitivity to @xmath10 .",
    "for all of the scattering processes considered in this paper , except for @xmath1 , we can define the momenta of the incoming , represented by @xmath56 , and outgoing , corresponding to @xmath57 , particles in terms of the coordinates fixed in the laboratory as @xmath58 note that the ordering of the co - ordinates used in these definitions is given by @xmath59 , so that the @xmath54-axis is along the beam direction as usual . using these definitions , the bilinear products of these momenta with the matrix @xmath11 , which appear in the feynman rules of fig .",
