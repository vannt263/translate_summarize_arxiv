    "the idea that our @xmath1 familiar spatial dimensions may exist as a submanifold of a higher dimensional space - time has opened a number of new avenues for string theory , particle physics and cosmology @xcite-@xcite .",
    "common to most of the recent incarnations is the condition that all interactions other than gravity be confined to our submanifold , or _",
    "brane_. since departures from @xmath2 dimensional gravity are relatively difficult to constrain compared to those of other forces , this permits significant freedom to modify the gravitational interactions in the extra - dimensional space .",
    "it is in this modification of gravity and of the extra - dimensions themselves that recent approaches differ from one another .    in many of the proposed models ,",
    "the hierarchy problem is recast by bringing the fundamental mass scale of physics down to the weak scale .",
    "the large planck mass observed on our @xmath1-brane is then a derived quantity , the size of which arises from the relatively large volume of the extra - dimensional manifold .",
    "a striking consequence of this is that one expects quantum gravity or stringy effects to manifest themselves close to the electroweak scale . at first sight , this opens up many interesting possibilities for testing the idea of extra dimensions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , it is typically possible to construct these models consistently in such a way that they evade expected experimental tests .",
    "one specific hurdle that extra - dimensional theories must clear is that the brane - bulk system should be a consistent , stable solution to einstein gravity . in this paper",
    "we consider this issue for those constructions that include negative - tension branes .",
    "while the notion of negative energies is typically problematic , perturbative dynamical objections can be overcome by placing the offending brane at an orientifold plane .    in this paper",
    "we address two other issues associated with negative - tension branes , one of which is specific to those at orbifold fixed planes .",
    "the first has to do with their consequences for the generalized second law of thermodynamics , which states that the total entropy in matter and black holes does not decrease . in einstein gravity",
    "this entropy can be written as @xmath3 where a is the sum of the event horizon areas of all black holes , and we are using planck units ( @xmath4 ) . in particular , any process which leaves @xmath5 fixed and decreases @xmath6 leads to a violation of the generalized second law .",
    "we begin with the simple observation that the area of a black hole event horizon increases when positive energy crosses the horizon , and decreases when negative energy crosses the horizon .",
    "a natural question then arises when one has a space - time with a negative tension brane : what happens if a black hole , initially far away from the brane , falls towards the brane and captures some of the brane within its horizon ?",
    "one might expect that the generalized second law could be violated in this way , since the part of the brane that is swallowed by the black hole carries negative energy across the horizon .    in general",
    ", of course , whether the horizon actually shrinks will depend on what other matter or gravitational radiation is falling into the black hole .",
    "for this reason we consider a lower - dimensional system ; a negative tension @xmath7-brane in a @xmath8 dimensional space - time .",
    "the absence of gravitational radiation in @xmath8 dimensions will force the conclusion that the horizon shrinks when the black hole encounters the negative tension brane .",
    "this is so whether or not the brane sits at an orbifold .",
    "this would provide a clear violation of the second law if the above collision connects two equilibrium configurations . whether or not this is so turns out to be an interesting question that our low dimensional context allows us to explore in detail . in @xmath8 dimensions ,",
    "the only black holes are the so called btz black holes of baados , teitelboim and zanelli @xcite , which arise only for negative cosmological constant .",
    "these black hole space - times can be constructed as a quotient of ads space itself .",
    "together with the lack of local gravitational degrees of freedom in 2 + 1 dimensions , this fact allows us to construct the general solution describing the collision of a black hole and a brane .",
    "interestingly , for branes at @xmath9 orbifolds the results depend dramatically on the sign of the brane tension .",
    "we investigate a 2-parameter family of solutions with negative tension branes in detail .",
    "this leads to our second issue .",
    "we find that the endpoint is not in fact an equilibrium configuration but instead is a space - like singularity similar to the ` big crunch ' of frw models with @xmath10 ( and no cosmological constant ) .",
    "continuity implies that a similar result occurs on an open subset of the full space of solutions , and it seems likely that the result is generic .",
    "this is naturally interpreted as a non - linear dynamical instability of gravitating negative tension branes at orbifolds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we provide a brief calculation of how the black hole horizon shrinks in our model . in section  [ sec : space - time ] we then describe how to construct initial data for the brane - black hole system in ads@xmath11 and investigate the dynamics of the system in detail .",
    "this dynamics is qualitatively different in various regions of parameter space .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] and offer some interpretations of our results .",
    "our purpose in this section is to give a description of how a horizon evolves as it falls towards the negative tension brane .",
    "a black hole horizon is a closed null hypersurface .",
    "if we consider a congruence of null geodesics with tangent vector @xmath12 orthogonal ( and therefore tangent ) to this hypersurface , then the divergence @xmath13 , describing the expansion or contraction of the congruence is described by the raychaudhuri equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the shear of the congruence , @xmath16 is its twist , and @xmath17 is the affine parameter .",
    "( for a detailed description of this equation see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "the metric used to raise and lower the indices @xmath18 is the induced metric on the null surface , which has signature ( 0,+,+ ) . as a result ,",
    "the twist term is positive definite .",
    "the shear term is related to the weyl tensor , and hence to the existence of gravitational radiation  all of which vanish in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "therefore , from now on we set @xmath19 .",
    "now , an infinitesimal area element @xmath20 of the event horizon of the black hole is related to @xmath21 via @xmath22 and therefore the raychaudhuri equation can be used to describe the evolution of the area as @xmath23 using the einstein equation , and recalling that @xmath12 is null , we may rewrite this as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy momentum tensor . since the brane has negative tension ,",
    "so long as no other matter is present we have @xmath26 for null @xmath12 not tangent to brane ( i.e. the null energy condition is violated ) .",
    "if the system were to reach equilibrium and a final horizon could be identified , the final expansion @xmath21 would vanish .",
    "it then follows from ( [ areaevolution2 ] ) and ( [ nullenergy ] ) that @xmath21 would have been negative during the collision itself .",
    "in particular , no caustics can form on this surface during the collision since immediately after a caustic the expansion of the corresponding null generator must be positive .",
    "thus , the null surface @xmath27 that eventually becomes the final horizon can be extended back to before the collision occurred , and we see that the area of @xmath27 was larger before the collision than it is afterward .",
    "similarly , suppose that the system began in equilibrium and that an initial horizon could be identified .",
    "any outward directed null congruence outside this initial horizon has positive expansion at this stage and we see that this will continue during the collision . thus , the null surface @xmath27 associated with the final horizon must begin inside the initial horizon . as a result ,",
    "the initial area of @xmath27 must be smaller than that of the initial horizon .",
    "since the area of @xmath27 decreases during the collision , the final area must be even smaller .",
    "we therefore arrive at a violation of the generalized second law if the system evolves from one equilibrium to another .",
    "the discussion in the previous section describes the process of a black hole colliding with a negative tension brane and traces the evolution of null congruences . on the surface",
    ", this would appear to yield a violation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "however , in order to identify particular null congruences as initial and final ` horizons , ' the evolution must connect two equilibrium configurations .    whether or not this is the case in our 2 + 1 setting",
    "is explored below through detailed investigation of the corresponding solutions .",
    "we require that our solutions contain a flat brane at an orbifold fixed plane and a btz black hole , but the space - time should be otherwise empty . because @xmath8 dimensional gravity",
    "contains no local dynamics , the metric will be locally ads everywhere except at the orbifold singularity .    at this point",
    "it is convenient to recall that the btz space - time is itself a quotient of ads space .",
    "similarly , recall that a space - time ( the ` brane - only space - time ' ) describing the negative tension brane by itself consists of two copies of ads patched together along the brane with @xmath9 orbifold boundary conditions .",
    "now , of particular interest are cases in which the black hole and brane are initially separated . by this",
    "we mean that at least near some cauchy surface @xmath28 there should be a region @xmath29 of space - time enclosing our black hole in which the metric takes the standard btz form .",
    "similarly , there should exist a region @xmath30 , near the brane .",
    "since the space - time is to contain no further topological complications we may take the union @xmath31 to contain a cauchy surface for the space - time and the intersection @xmath32 to be contractible .",
    "let us now count the number of parameters needed to describe our space - time .",
    "the tension of the brane is fixed by the cosmological constant , so there are no parameters associated with the brane region @xmath30 itself .",
    "the btz region @xmath29 is determined by two free parameters corresponding to the mass and spin of the btz black hole . since the btz space - time and the brane - only space - time are by themselves locally ads , the intersection @xmath32 is associated with an element of the ads isometry group so(2,2 ) which serves to patch the two regions together .",
    "now consider a ` fundamental region ' @xmath33 of ads space that covers the btz space - time exactly once under the btz quotient map .",
    "further , in the brane - only space - time the ads region on one side of the brane is related to that on the other side through the orbifolding procedure .",
    "hence , we refer to the region on one side of the brane as the ` fundamental region ' @xmath34 ads .",
    "we may therefore write @xmath35 and @xmath36 , provided that we keep in mind the appropriate identifications .",
    "the choice of @xmath33 and @xmath37 is , of course , unique only up to an element of the ads symmetry group so(2,2 ) .",
    "however , we may use this symmetry to bring one of the fundamental regions into a standard configuration .",
    "thus , only that element of so(2,2 ) describing the relative configuration of @xmath33 and @xmath37 in ads is of interest .",
    "this is precisely the freedom associated with the overlap of @xmath29 and @xmath30 in our space - time .",
    "consider then the set of all space - times constructed by specifying btz and brane fundamental regions @xmath33 and @xmath37 in ads@xmath11 , taking the intersection @xmath38 and making appropriate identifications .",
    "we have shown that all of the space - times we seek will lie in this set .",
    "however , some space - times constructed in this way may fail to be smooth or may fail to contain separated branes and black holes .",
    "thus , we may say that the identification of @xmath33 and @xmath37 is necessary but not sufficient for building the space - times of interest .",
    "it will be enough for us to analyze the most straightforward case in which @xmath28 is a moment of time symmetry . from now on we will assume that this condition holds . as a result , we now restrict consideration to spinless btz black holes .",
    "much of the physics of this problem can be understood by studying the initial data associated with the moment of time symmetry .",
    "if @xmath39 is a global time coordinate on ads@xmath11 , we may take this moment to occur in the slice @xmath28 .",
    "here it is convenient to consider ads@xmath11 as a solid cylinder so that the @xmath28 surface is a disk . given the condition that @xmath33 and @xmath37 respect this time symmetry , the identifications of ads used to make the btz or brane space - times preserve the surface @xmath28 .",
    "as a result , we may speak about the fundamental domains @xmath40 and @xmath41 associated with the corresponding quotient of the @xmath28 slice .",
    "the space of time symmetric initial data is labelled by four parameters . to see this , recall that the black hole spin has been set to zero and that the requirement that the brane and black hole both be present at @xmath28 forces the so(2,2 ) parameter used to patch together @xmath29 and @xmath30 to take values in @xmath42 , the symmetry group of the @xmath28 surface itself . however , it is sufficient for our purposes to work with the two parameter sub - family in which we require the space - time to have an additional @xmath9 symmetry as described below .",
    "this requirement breaks the @xmath43 down to just the one - dimensional subgroup associated with one of the boost generators , and we may think of the associated free parameter as the location of the brane in poincar coordinates .",
    "for definiteness we will work in global coordinates @xmath44 in which the ads line element takes the form @xmath45 \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "these are the coordinates referred to as ` sausage coordinates ' in @xcite , which is a useful reference for visualizing the btz fundamental region .",
    "the extra @xmath9 symmetry we impose corresponds to invariance under @xmath49 .    using these coordinates , @xmath41 and @xmath50",
    "are drawn in figure  [ figure1 ] and figure  [ figure2 ] respectively .",
    "the fundamental domains are the unshaded regions .",
    "each figure shows three sample cases illustrating what happens when we change the free parameter associated with the respective fundamental region . in figure",
    "[ figure1 ] , the parameter ( which we call @xmath6 ) may be thought of as the location of the brane in poincar coordinates .",
    "the three cases shown there are of course related by the action of an ads isometry , but this will shortly be broken by the presence of the black hole . in figure",
    "[ figure2 ] , the parameter is the mass @xmath51 of the btz black hole , which controls the ` size ' of the fundamental region as shown . the dotted line in figure  [ figure2 ] is the intersection of the black hole horizon with the @xmath28 surface .",
    "this intersection is the bifurcation surface of the horizon .",
    "it remains to put these domains together in a consistent way .",
    "we are interested in configurations in which the black hole and brane are separated at @xmath28 , meaning that the brane lies entirely on one side of the black hole horizon .",
    "it is clear that for any black hole mass @xmath51 one can choose a large enough value of @xmath6 so that the objects are indeed separated .",
    "note that rotating the disks in figure  [ figure2 ] by the action @xmath52 would also yield a configuration compatible with our symmetries , but that it would then be impossible to separate the brane and black hole . ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that positive tension branes behave very differently .",
    "we may represent a positive tension brane as in figure  [ figure1 ] above , but with the shaded region now representing the fundamental region .",
    "a glance at figures 1 and 2 shows that it is now impossible to separate brane and black hole .",
    "this is clearly a reflection of the well - known statement that there is only a ` small ' region of ads that is far from a positive tension brane on a @xmath9 orbifold .      in section [ i d ]",
    "we established the existence of initial data representing a separated , momentarily static configuration containing a black hole and a negative tension brane .",
    "we now wish to study the time evolution of this solution .",
    "certain qualitative features are readily deduced from the well - known properties of black holes and branes with respect to the global coordinates @xmath44 on ads@xmath11 .",
    "for example , as @xmath39 increases the black hole horizon expands outward to both right and left , while the boundaries of the btz fundamental region move toward each other ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the brane expands , with the ends separating and moving along the boundary at the speed of light .",
    "a typical configuration of both black hole and brane for @xmath53 is shown in figure  [ figure3 ] .",
    "the expansion of the brane and the contraction of the btz fundamental region clearly results in contact between the boundaries of @xmath33 and @xmath37 .",
    "the points of contact will be conical singularities in the resulting space - time .",
    "if we simply extrapolate the behavior of these boundaries it would appear that the entire space - time outside the black hole would quickly disappear into such a singularity .",
    "however , once the singularity forms it is no longer clear that we can follow the evolution using classical general relativity .",
    "it is therefore important to discover whether events along this potential singularity are causally connected , so that we may determine whether modifications to general relativity at one such point could affect the formation of the rest of the singularity .",
    "this turns out to be simplest to analyze in poincar coordinates , which we label @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the relevant metric is most easily obtained by making use of ` embedding ' coordinates as an intermediate step .",
    "recall that ads@xmath11 may be described as the surface @xmath57 embedded in @xmath58 dimensional minkowski space , with line element @xmath59 in ( [ adsembeddedsurface ] ) , @xmath60 is the ads length scale .",
    "the embedding coordinates @xmath61 are related to our global coordinates via @xmath62 \\sin \\left(\\frac{t}{\\ell}\\right ) \\cr y = \\frac{2 \\ell^2 \\rho}{\\ell^2 - \\rho^2 } \\sin ( \\phi ) \\ , \\ \\ \\ & \\ & \\ \\ \\ u = \\ell\\left[\\frac{\\ell^2 + \\rho^2}{\\ell^2 - \\rho^2}\\right ] \\cos \\left(\\frac{t}{\\ell}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the poincar coordinates can then be expressed as @xmath63 with the resulting line element @xmath64 these coordinates have two particularly useful simplifying properties .",
    "first , the metric ( [ pm ] ) is conformal to the minkowski metric and , second , these coordinates may be chosen so that the brane is located on the hypersurface @xmath65 .",
    "note that in our various coordinate systems the moment of time symmetry can be equivalently characterized as @xmath28 , @xmath66 , or @xmath67 . in addition , the @xmath9 symmetry @xmath49 can be represented in poincar coordinates as @xmath68 .",
    "we must now identify the boundary of the btz fundamental region in poincar coordinates . to describe @xmath33 ,",
    "it is useful to introduce the parameter @xmath69 it is easily seen @xcite that a useful choice for the boundary of the btz fundamental region consists , in embedding coordinates , of the two surfaces @xmath70 translating this into poincar coordinates we obtain @xmath71 with the positive sign describing the upper boundary and the negative sign the lower one . from now on",
    ", we shall follow only the upper boundary , as the two are related by our @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "recall that ads@xmath11 in poincar coordinates is conformally equivalent to minkowski space with metric @xmath72 the singularity forms on the line where the brane ( @xmath65 ) intersects the surface described by ( [ btzb ] ) . in terms of the conformally rescaled space ,",
    "it is clear that this singularity propagates in a straight line ( along @xmath65 ) at a speed determined by ( [ btzb ] ) with @xmath65 .",
    "a short calculation shows that this speed is @xmath73 further , the condition that the brane and the boundary of @xmath33 be separated at the moment of time symmetry ( @xmath67 ) yields @xmath74 which , when substituted into ( [ singspeed ] ) , yields @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , the singularity propagates in a straight line at a velocity greater than that of light in the conformally rescaled metric .",
    "in fact , the singularity lies on a surface that , in poincar coordinates lies in the @xmath65 plane on the two hyperbolae . to form the singular surface ,",
    "one should include only those pieces of each hyperbola which do not lie to the future of any event on the other hyperbola .",
    "] of constant proper time @xmath76 from the events @xmath65 , @xmath77 , @xmath67 .",
    "it follows that no two points on the singularity are in causal contact .    to better understand this , note that figures  [ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ]",
    "show that , for any brane position @xmath6 one can in fact choose a black hole small enough that the boundaries of the two fundamental regions contact at @xmath28 , or as close to @xmath28 as one would like . in particular , this occurs ` first ' outside the horizon .",
    "one can also show that for @xmath78 the singularity ` first ' develops inside the horizon if time ordering is defined using the poincar coordinate @xmath54 .",
    "however , since no two points along the singularity are in causal contact , we see that this ordering is of little relevance .",
    "therefore , the singularity is best thought of as arising ` simultaneously ' throughout the space - time .",
    "our conclusion must hold in the original ads metric as well .",
    "it follows that the collision of black hole and brane ends not in a black hole attached to the brane , but instead in a space - like singularity in which much of the universe is destroyed .",
    "the attentive reader will have noticed something interesting about the line @xmath79 , @xmath65 , which may be thought of as the ` leading piece of the brane ' in the global coordinates of figure  [ figure3 ] .",
    "this line reaches the singularity at the finite time @xmath80 it may seem odd that this event is not on the edge of the ads space .",
    "however , one can readily show that the event does lie on the singularity of the btz black hole ; in particular , between the two horizons .",
    "thus , we see that the collision - induced singularity engulfs the entire exterior space - time on the side of the black hole that contains the brane , and that this singularity joins on to the black hole singularity .",
    "in fact , one could perhaps interpret this result as extending the black hole singularity out to the edge of the space - time , destroying the future asymptotic region and making the concept of an event horizon meaningless on the right side of the black hole .    in any case",
    ", one sees that our new singularity does not extend into the left exterior region of the btz space - time .",
    "the left exterior is completely unaffected by the presence of the brane in the right exterior .",
    "this is as it should be , since the black hole horizons should prevent any influence from propagating from the right exterior to the left one .",
    "the appearance of this singularity seems to demonstrate an instability of the system that is perhaps of even more interest than the potential failure of thermodynamics described in section [ sec : raychauduri ] .",
    "we have illustrated two difficulties that arise when negative tension branes encounter black holes .",
    "the first is a potential violation of the generalized second law of thermodynamics that can occur whether or not the brane is located at an orbifold fixed plane .",
    "note that if the negative energy stored in the brane tension could be transformed into some other sort of energy , then one could also use it to violate the second law in systems without black holes .",
    "for example , if the negative energy could be used to cool a hot star , this cooling would seem to lead to a decrease in entropy .",
    "the important feature of black holes is thus that any form of energy that enters them directly affects the horizon area ( and thus the entropy ) .",
    "the second difficulty we investigated is a nonlinear dynamical instability that causes the entire space - time outside the black hole to collapse when the brane is located at an orbifold fixed plane .",
    "we have seen that horizons of 2 + 1 dimensional black holes shrink when encountering a negative tension brane if no other matter is present .",
    "this follows from the identical vanishing of the shear of a null congruence in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "one expects similar behavior to occur in higher dimensions , unless for some reason a significant quantity of gravitational radiation is also present so that the shear term becomes important in the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "this results in a clear violation of the second law of thermodynamics if the collision connects two equilibrium configurations . ideally , we would like to begin with a black hole well - separated from the brane and end with some well - defined configuration .",
    "we found in section [ sec : space - time ] that 2 + 1 space - times containing a moment of time symmetry with well - separated btz black holes and negative tension branes do in fact exist .",
    "the black hole and brane then begin to fall toward one another .",
    "the result of this collision is the collapse of the entire space - time outside the black hole in a space - like singularity .",
    "although we have explicitly discussed only a two parameter subfamily of the full 4-parameter family of such time symmetric initial data , continuity tells us that the same result follows for an open subset of such data containing our subfamily .",
    "similarly , the conclusion must hold for an open subset of the full space of initial data , which would allow for spinning black holes as well .",
    "let us note that the singularity forms along the brane and let us recall that it can be thought of as forming simultaneously across the entire space - time outside the black hole . as a result ,",
    "it is clear that at least some of the brane falls through the horizon of the black hole before the singularity develops .",
    "the black hole then proceeds to ` eat ' the brane and reduce in size . where the horizon intersects the final singularity , it is of zero size .",
    "the area of the piece of brane that falls through the horizon before the singularity occurs can be calculated .",
    "multiplying by the brane tension gives @xmath81 which , roughly speaking , is the amount of negative brane mass that has fallen though the horizon .",
    "one can show that this is much greater than @xmath51 .",
    "it is natural to associate this excess with the kinetic energy that the system acquires during the time in which the brane and black hole are falling toward each other so that the sum of @xmath51 , the kinetic energy , and @xmath82 vanishes .",
    "we would like to interpret the singularity formed in the collision as describing a non - linear instability in the presence of negative tension branes on @xmath9 orbifolds .",
    "however , this raises certain questions .",
    "first , we have seen that , for a fixed ` brane location ' @xmath6 , separated black holes arise only when the mass of the black hole is sufficiently large . as a result",
    ", one might be tempted to think that any such instability is triggered only by large disturbances .",
    "recall , however , that the brane location @xmath6 is not physically meaningful in and of itself .",
    "there is in fact an ads isometry that simply scales the poincar coordinates , taking our brane to an arbitrary new value of @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the correct statement is that black holes of any size are allowed so long as they are sufficiently far away from the brane .",
    "in addition , it is known that btz black holes can form dynamically from the collision of matter @xcite .",
    "one would therefore naively expect that arbitrarily small btz black holes could in fact be formed even close to negative tension branes .",
    "the natural conclusion is that the formation process can begin near the brane , but that a singularity of the sort discussed here arises before this process is complete .",
    "thus , we expect non - linear instabilities with negative tension branes in the presence of matter fields even if no black holes are initially present .    one may ask whether the same sort of singularity that we found in 2 + 1 dimensions also occurs in higher dimensional cases .",
    "after all , we have shown that no smooth static solutions exist for black holes on positive tension branes in the 2 + 1 dimensional case , while such solutions have constructed in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "let us first recall that certain black holes @xcite in higher dimensions are also asymptotically ads and can be represented as quotients of ads space analogous to those that yield the btz black hole in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "collisions of such black holes with negative tension branes are quite similar .",
    "the singularity again lies in the @xmath65 plane on hyperbolae of constant proper time @xmath76 from the events at @xmath65 , @xmath83 and so forms a causally disconnected set .",
    "however , black holes constructed in this way have an unusual topology for both the horizon and any associated anti - de sitter region @xcite-@xcite . as a result",
    ", such black holes do not form from the collapse of matter subject to normal boundary conditions .",
    "these examples are therefore not sufficient to argue convincingly for a dynamical instability in higher dimensions .",
    "clearly , a productive line of investigation in 3 + 1 dimensions would be to perform a stability analysis of the solution found in @xcite describing a black hole on a negative tension 2 + 1 brane .",
    "lastly , let us recall that negative tension objects are often motivated by considering orientifold constructions of string theory .",
    "although orientifolds do indeed have negative tension , it is important to note two further properties .",
    "first , when orientifolds arise in a space - time that is locally asymptotically flat , the orientifolds have enough supersymmetry ( see e.g. @xcite ) to allow one to show that they represent a state of minimal energy for their charge . as a result , one strongly expects that they are dynamically stable even in the presence of ( at least uncharged ) black holes .",
    "second , let us consider a particularly well understood orientifold known as the o6-plane . when the coupling is strong enough , this orientifold corresponds to a smooth classical eleven - dimensional space - time @xcite which is @xmath84 times the atiyah - hitchin metric @xcite .",
    "this space - time is ricci - flat and satisfies the vacuum einstein equations . as a result",
    ", one may describe the collision of a black hole with such an orientifold as a problem in pure einstein - hilbert gravity . under such conditions ,",
    "the raychaudhuri equation leads in the usual way @xcite to the conclusion that the total horizon area increases . as a result",
    ", our violations of the generalized second law of thermodynamics will not arise in this context . as the various stringy negative tension orientifolds are related by t - duality ,",
    "one expects that the other orientifolds of string theory also have properties such that the second law of thermodynamics is upheld in collisions with black holes .",
    "since we have seen that the orbifold boundary condition itself is not sufficient , it would be interesting to understand in more detail just what properties of these orientifolds enforce the second law .",
    "for example , it may be due the special form of the coupling of an orientifold to the dilaton or gauge fields of string theory .    in summary",
    ", we have seen that the orbifold boundary condition of e.g. @xcite is not by itself sufficient to render negative tension branes stable .",
    "our results indicate that both thermodynamic and non - linear dynamical instabilities remain . as a result , if use is to be made of negative tension branes in various models , it is important first to show that the particular branes being used are immune from these effects .",
    "a conservative working hypothesis might be that only the rather specific negative tension branes that arise as supersymmetric orientifolds of string theory should be considered .",
