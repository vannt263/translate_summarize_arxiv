    "among the recently studied superconducting compounds there are several groups of materials ( copper oxides , fullerides , chevrel phases , barium bismuthates ... ) which share some nonconventional features like high @xmath2 with relatively low carrier concentration , short coherence length together with extremely small @xmath15 ratio and universal dependence of @xmath16 vs. @xmath11 ^ 2 $ ] @xcite . above features suggest that a short range almost nonretarded attraction is responsible for pairing in these systems @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest effective models to describe this situation is the negative@xmath0 hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "this model constitutes a common basis for the description of the superconductors with weak local electron pairing , being in many ways similar to the classical bcs systems , and superconductors with strong attraction where the local pairs conform to weakly charged hard core bosons @xcite .",
    "it has been considered as an effective model of superconductivity in the family of cuprates @xcite , the barium bismuthates @xcite , the fullerides @xcite and the chevrel phases @xcite .",
    "in our paper we present some new results of an analysis of the several basic thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of this model for various types of lattice structure .",
    "we have concentrated on the case of ( i ) square ( sq , @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 ) , ( ii ) simple cubic ( sc , @xmath17@xmath18@xmath20 ) and ( iii ) face  centered cubic ( fcc , @xmath17@xmath18@xmath20 ) lattices , i.e. structures representing ( i ) the family of cuprates , ( ii ) the chevrel phases and barium bismuthates and ( iii ) the fullerides , respectively . for comparison",
    "we also present the results obtained for a model rectangular density of states @xmath21 .",
    "to calculate quantities of interest we use the ( broken symmetry ) hartree  fock approximation ( hfa ) which is known to give credible results at @xmath22  k as concerns energy of the ground state , the energy gap , the chemical potential as well as the collective excitations in the whole interaction range , interpolating smoothly between the weak and strong@xmath0 limit , where it matches the results of the perturbation theory developed from the zero  bandwidth limit @xcite . on the other hand the hfa leads to qualitatively erroneous results for the the thermodynamic critical field @xmath4 and ginzburg  landau correlation length @xmath5 in the strong attraction limit .",
    "this failure is due to the fact that the hfa greatly overestimates the energy of the _ normal _ state which is used in a standard calculation of @xmath4 and next @xmath5 . in order to discuss the behaviour of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and ginzburg ratio @xmath23 in the whole interaction range we have completed the results of the hfa calculation with the ones of the perturbation theory .",
    "we will also point out a possible relevance of our results to the recent experimental data for the short  coherence length superconductors .",
    "we consider the negative@xmath0 hubbard hamiltonian in the hypercubic lattice @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hopping integral , @xmath26 is a unit lattice vector and the exponential ( peierls ) factors in ( [ hubbard ] ) account for the coupling of electrons to the magnetic field via its vector potential @xmath27 .",

    "this situation is common in many low@xmath2 systems .",
    "the short  coherence length materials , including the high @xmath2 superconductors represent the opposite , i.e. the london limit . in the latter case the ground state penetration depth is determined entirely by the @xmath51 limit of the kernel where the paramagnetic part of the kernel vanishes and @xmath3 is given by :    @xmath52    in our calculation of @xmath3 we restrict ourselves to the london limit having in mind the properties of the systems of interest and finaly determine the area in the @xmath0@xmath6 parameters space where the local approximation may be valid .",
