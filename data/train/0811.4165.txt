    "most straightforward are extensions of measurements and searches that are currently statistically limited . some of the more prominent examples are @xmath11 ( which strongly constrains @xmath7 ) , the dalitz analyses used to obtain @xmath8 , radiative @xmath12 and @xmath13 decays , and lepton - flavor - violating tau decays . more intriguing , though , is the sensitivity of this region to new particles and forces .",

    "with a goal toward exploring beyond the horizon into the tev mass range as well as leveraging current successes , a second - generation @xmath3-factory has been proposed at kek .",

    "the luminosity goals of `` superkekb '' are @xmath80 instantaneous and @xmath81 integrated luminosities , to be achieved through multiple incremental improvements , each of which is designed to roughly double the luminosity yield .",
    "they include improvements to the positron damping ring , superconducting rf , beam pipe design , crab cavities , and energy exchange c - band .",
    "while it is hard to guarantee performance in a beam collider , the kekb team has an excellent record of meeting and exceeding expectations . in the current plan , which is presented as a baseline , the upgrade",
    "is phased so that it can be achieved with a continuation of the current level of funding . assuming a 3-year shutdown for construction starting in 2009 and 200 days per year of operations",
    ", it will be possible to collect 50ab@xmath14 by 2028 .",
    "a crucial step for kekb is the implementation of `` crab '' cavities , to rotate the beams , which cross at a small angle , so that the beam overlap is maximized and collisions are `` head - on . ''",
    "crab cavities were installed in the winter of 2007 and have been operating since spring 2007 . thus far",
    "the principle of the crab design has been validated through the consistency of achieved specific luminosity with the predictions of simulations .",
    "the maximum luminosity during the recent run has been @xmath82 , approximately equal to the maximum obtained without crab cavities . to achieve the projected factor of two gain in luminosity",
    ", kekb is working to improve the maximum stable beam current .",
    "increased beam current is accompanied by increases in background particles and events and synchrotron radiation , which in turn increase the rates to the detector for general radiation damage , detector occupancy , fake hits , pile - up , and triggers .",
    "figure  [ fig : backgroundprojection ] shows the predicted rates for several types of background , based on projected currents and luminosities , in the major sectors of the belle detector .",
    "most will experience a five - fold increase over current levels during early operations of the upgraded ring , increasing to approximately twenty - fold at maximum luminosity .",
    "the upgrades to the belle detector will focus on improving hadron identification and background tolerance .",
    "an upgrade task force has been investigating these questions for several years .",
    "a letter of intent signed by nearly 300 physicsts from 61 institutions was submitted to kek in 2004@xcite .",
    "kek has launched a call for the formation of a new collaboration , temporarily named sbelle , to build and operate the upgraded detector .",
    "the upgraded detector must be able to operate with a twenty - fold increase in background particles and a fifty - fold increase in real event rate over current conditions .",
    "modules targeted for upgrade include data acquisition , silicon tracker , central drift chamber , particle i d device , calorimeter , and @xmath83 detector .",
    "we describe briefly the current concept for each .",
    "the silicon inner tracker is a critical component for vertexing but is at the same time exposed to high radiation doses and experiences high occupancy .",
    "the upgrade design includes two additional outer layers which will have short strips to limit occupancy , fast electronics with reduced readout time ( from 800  ns to 50  ns ) , and a pipelined readout .",
    "as with silicon strip detectors in most current experiments , it is designed to be replaced periodically , and in a later version the inner layers will be closer to the beam line , 10  mm as opposed to the current 15  mm , and consist of pixel detectors , which are less vulnerable to radiation damage .",
    "the central drift chamber will occupy a larger volume , having a larger inner radius ( 77  mm @xmath84 160  mm ) to accommodate the new silicon tracker and an outer radius expanding into space previously occupied by aerogel and time - of - flight detectors ( 880  mm @xmath84 1140  mm ) . to reduce occupancy each drift cell will be smaller , with an attendant increase in the number of sense wires to 15,140 from the current 8,400 .",
    "while the aerogel threshold erenkov and time - of - flight counters have served belle well , there is strong motivation to achieve better hadron separation for sbelle ; for example , @xmath85 separation at momenta in the 2 - 4  gev/@xmath36 range will need significant improvement to bring out a @xmath13 signal above @xmath12 . to accomplish this ,",
    "the current threshold erenkov / tof system in the barrel region will be replaced .",
    "all of the designs under consideration involve the collection of erenkov light from quartz glass radiators with sensitivity to the erenkov angle .",
    "the time - of - propagation ( top ) device measures the arrival time of photons , which depends on the time - of - flight from interaction point to the radiator and on the angle - dependent path length of the photon traveling the length of the bar via total internal reflection .",
    "the `` imaging top '' concept adds a focusing mirror on one end and a photon collection array at the other that corrects for chromaticity and improves the performance .",
    "the `` focusing dirc '' concept measures the angle more directly , through angle - dependent imaging of the light .",
    "in addition to a new barrel detector , a ring - imaging aerogel detector is planned for the endcap region .    while the current electromagnetic calorimeter , consisting of tl - doped csi crystals viewed by silicon photodiodes , achieves excellent resolution ,",
    "modifications will be needed to maintain resolution at higher luminosities . in the barrel",
    "the signal waveform will be sampled and fitted to avoid deterioration of resolution .",
    "the relatively slow response ( @xmath86s ) of tl - doped csi would result in degradation of signals in the endcap region due to pileup , the superposition of unrelated pulses over many beam crossings .",
    "the existing endcap will thus be replaced with pure csi crystals , which have a rise time @xmath87ns , viewed by photomultipliers , which are well matched to the spectrum and speed of the csi response .",
    "the belle @xmath83 detector , which consists of 5  cm steel plates interspersed with glass resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) running in streamer mode , has separate barrel and endcap systems .",
    "the expected rates at the outer barrel region are sufficiently low that the existing chambers can be used at super - kekb if run in avalanche mode .",
    "the rates in the endcap regions will be beyond the capacity of the rpc s , so it has been proposed that the endcaps be replaced with plastic scintillator strips , with each layer in a 2-dimensional grid .",
    "the `` kek roadmap '' outlines the long - range plan of the lab on a time scale of 10 + years .",
    "the roadmap report released on january 4 , 2008 , by the director a.  suzuki and the kek management has included the kekb luminosity and detector upgrades ; this report was affirmed by the external roadmap review committe in march 2008 .",
    "a key feature in this preliminary version of the plan is that it accomplishes the upgrade with a flat funding profile . according to the plan",
    ", kekb and belle will end datataking in 2009 , and the activity will shift to super - kekb / detector construction for a three - year period , after which super - kekb operations will commence .",
    "the initial luminosity goal is @xmath88 .",
    "additional rf cavities will be installed as funding permits , raising luminosity over several years to @xmath89 . while details are still under discussion between kek and the japanese funding agency ( mext ) , the appearance of the kekb upgrade as an official item in the roadmap is highly significant .",
    "the next step in the project will be to assemble an international collaboration to build and operate sbelle .",
    "any institution is welcome to join and will have excellent opportunities to share in the construction and physics bounty .",
    "interested investigators are invited to contact anyone in the interim steering committee .",
    "the @xmath3-factories will have collected during their lifetime , 1999 - 2009 , over 1.4 billion @xmath3 pairs at the @xmath0(4s ) resonance . based on these data ,",
    "the ckm matrix has been firmly established as the origin of @xmath5 asymmetry in the weak interaction .",
    "it has been possible to make multiple independent measurements of parameters to test the unitarity of the ckm matrix , including the three phase angles @xmath90 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , as well as @xmath91 , with a precision that would have been considered optimistic a decade ago .",
    "some internal inconsistencies in the global fit of ckm , as well as mysteries such as unexpected differences in @xmath5 asymmetry among @xmath92 modes , may hint at breaks in the standard model . by increasing the data by two orders of magnitude , one can study rare decays and improve precision to the point of probing physics into the tev mass scale . the kekb upgrade , which will ultimately run at @xmath89 luminosity will focus on @xmath5-asymmetries in @xmath3 penguin decays , tests of lepton universality , lepton flavor violation , and precision measurement of all aspects of the ckm matrix . the project has been included in the kek roadmap in 2008 , a major step in bringing it to reality .",
    "the proposed detector upgrade , currently named sbelle , has been under study for several years .",
    "the technical design will be finalized in the next year , and a new international collaboration is being formed ."
