    "geminga has long been known as a strong x - ray and gamma - ray continuum source ( @xcite ) and , in 1987 , was identified with an optical star ( @xcite ) . in 1992 ,",
    "geminga was detected at x - ray ( @xcite ) and gamma - ray ( @xcite ) energies as a 237-ms pulsar with a period derivative of @xmath2 s s@xmath3 , indicating a characteristic age of @xmath4 yr and a magnetic field of @xmath5 gauss .",
    "a proper motion of @xmath6 mas yr@xmath3 and a parallax of @xmath7 mas have been measured for geminga s optical counterpart ( @xcite ) . from these measurements , a distance of 157@xmath8 pc and a transverse velocity of @xmath9 km s@xmath3 have been calculated .    since its discovery as a gamma - ray source in 1975 ,",
    "many observers have unsuccessfully attempted radio detection of geminga both as a continuum source ( @xcite ) and as a pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , however , three independent groups ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have reported successful detections of pulsed radio emission from geminga .",
    "all 3 detections were made at the pushchino radio astronomy observatory at a radio frequency of 102 mhz , a lower frequency than those used for previous searches .",
    "all three groups calculate a dispersion measure ( dm ) of roughly 3 pc @xmath10 .",
    "the measured fluxes vary greatly , perhaps due to interstellar scintillations , and range from 5 - 500 mjy . reported pulse widths range from 10 to 120 ms .",
    "recently , shitov & malofeev ( 1997 ) reported a 41 mhz detection of geminga with mean flux density 300 mjy . comparing this result with malofeev and malov s quoted 102 mhz mean flux of 60 mjy",
    ", we may estimate a spectral index of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "comparing malofeev and malov s quoted mean flux of 60 mjy with the previous 1 mjy upper limit at 1.4 ghz ( @xcite ) , we calculate a lower bound on geminga s spectral index of @xmath13 .",
    "since geminga is the _ only _ known gamma - ray pulsar which is not also a strong radio source , confirming its existence as a radio pulsar and determining the reasons for its radio weakness are essential to understanding the relationship between pulsar radio and gamma - ray emission .",
    "geminga is also important as it may be a prototype for a class of radio - weak or radio - quiet high - energy pulsars which could account for some of the 80 egret sources not yet identified with known pulsars or active galactic nuclei .",
    "we have therefore revisited the search for geminga as a radio pulsar with a long , low frequency , fast - sampled vla observation . in this paper , we present our results , introducing bayesian methods for determining the pulsed flux in a signal of unknown width and phase and for estimating the intrinsic flux density of a source , accounting for interstellar scintillations .",
    "we observed geminga ( psr j0633 + 1746 ) on 2 february 1998 with the d - configured vla in phased array mode .",
    "the data spanned a bandwidth of 25 mhz , centered on 317.5 mhz , with 14 ( not necessarily consecutive ) 1-mhz channels ( situated to avoid known interference frequencies ) .",
    "full polarization data were recorded with the high time resolution processor ( @xcite ) using a sampling frequency of 1152 hz .",
    "we obtained 7 one - hour observations ( scans ) of geminga which spanned a total time of 9 hours .",
    "two other known pulsars ( b0329 + 54 and b0950 + 08 ) were observed for 10 minutes each with the same setup as that used for geminga .",
    "each scan was started on a 10 second tick to ensure accurate pulse phase referencing between scans .",
    "this 10-second tick was tied to the vla s hydrogen maser , which is compared to universal time through the gps .",
    "the array was phased , with rms phase errors less than 1@xmath14 , between consecutive scans .",
    "we observed a strong vla calibrator source ( b0813 + 482 ) with known flux density ( @xmath15 = 45 jy ) to calculate the gain in each of the 56 channels ( 14 frequencies and 4 polarizations ) .",
    "as we expect only a 7-mjy uncertainty in our flux density calibration due to radiometer noise , our main source of uncertainty is the intrinsic source flux variation . by comparing the vla flux measurement with those from the westerbork and texas surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ", we estimate a maximum intrinsic flux density variation of 10% .",
    "we therefore expect errors in our final reported flux densities to be less than 10% .",
    "for each of the 7 geminga data sets , we summed polarizations to calculate the total intensity and dedispersed all 14 frequency channels using a dm of 3.2 pc @xmath10 , the midpoint of the dm range predicted by the tc ( @xcite ) model for galactic electron density given geminga s measured distance and direction .",
    "our estimated dm is consistent with those reported for the 102 mhz geminga detections .",
    "we note than even a 1 pc @xmath10 error in our assumed dm would produce only 7 ms of pulse smearing , negligible for geminga s period of 237 ms .",
    "each one - hour dedispersed time series was folded using the gamma - ray ephemeris of mattox et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( p = @xmath16 s , @xmath17 s s@xmath3 , epoch = 2446600 ) .",
    "we used a single period to fold each 1 hour data set , but updated the period between scans , using the gamma - ray ephemeris and tempo ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that using a single period for each scan results in only 0.2 ms of pulse smearing .",
    "table 1 lists the modified julian date of the midpoint of each scan , the corresponding period , and the total length of the scan .",
    "the first 6 scans are 1 hr in length , while the last is 50 minutes , yielding a total integration time of 6 hr 50 min .",

    "we have verified that our phase - shifting algorithm is correct by applying it to the observatory generated 19.2 hz waveguide switch signal .",
    "there is structure in some of the profiles of figure 1 .",
    "however , no consistent pulse shape and/or phase is apparent .",
    "furthermore , coherently summing all profiles dramatically decreases the signal - to - noise level of any features .",
    "we have also calculated fourier transforms of all 7 dedispersed time series .",

    "these data were processed with identical dedispersion and folding routines to the geminga data .",
    "we have subtracted the off - pulse mean to calculate @xmath18 , the phase - averaged pulsed flux density . for psr b0329 + 54 , @xmath18 = 1071 mjy , and for psr b0950 + 08",
    ", @xmath18 = 8.9 mjy .",
    "we note that we also detected both pulsars with high signal - to - noise in fourier transforms of their time series .    because geminga may be too weak to be detected through its time - averaged flux , we searched for crab - like ` giant ' pulses , or individual pulses with amplitudes much greater than the mean pulse amplitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "we search for these aperiodic , dispersed pulses by dedispersing each data set over a range of trial dms and , for each dedispersed time series , recording those pulses with amplitudes above some signal - to - noise threshold .",
    "we enchanced our sensitivity to broadened pulses by repeating this thresholding with different levels of time series smoothing .",
    "we found no evidence for isolated pulses from geminga . in figure 3 , we show the results of this analysis for geminga , psr b0950 + 08 , and psr b0329 + 54 , from which we detect a large number of individual pulses .      in appendix",
    "a , we derive a bayesian procedure for estimating the pulsed flux density given a folded profile with a pulse of unknown amplitude , width , and phase . assuming the additive noise is gaussian",
    ", we are able to calculate a probability density function ( pdf ) for the phase - averaged pulsed flux density _ independent _ of pulse width , pulse amplitude , pulse phase , off - pulse mean , and off - pulse rms . because no prior assumptions are necessary to calculate an upper limit , this method is an improvement over standard methods used to test for pulse shape uniformity and to calculate upper limits .",
    "the @xmath19 statistic , the method most commonly used , returns only the deviation of a binned pulse profile from a uniform distribution .",
    "more sophisticated tests , such as the z@xmath20 and h tests ( @xcite ) , developed to analyze sparse x - ray and gamma - ray profiles , are less dependent on binning and more sensitive to a wide variety of pulse shapes than the @xmath19 statistic , but still yield only the probability that a distribution differs from uniformity . to calculate an actual upper limit",
    ", one must still assume a pulse width and phase .",
    "furthermore , these methods do not provide a simple mechanism for calculating a pdf for the pulsed flux density . in following papers",
    ", we will use our method to calculate more accurate x - ray and gamma - ray upper limits for known radio pulsars and to search for new high - energy pulsars .",
    "the method can also be adapted to a wide range of pulse shapes , in addition to the simple square pulse presented in appendix a.    we apply the method of appendix a to calculate pdfs for the pulsed flux density for the folded geminga pulse profiles shown in figure 1 .",
    "the resultant pdfs are also shown in figure 1 and are discussed further in section 3.2.2 .",
    "since geminga is a nearby ( d @xmath21 150 pc ) pulsar , we expect its flux density to be strongly modulated by diffractive interstellar scintillations ( diss ) .",
    "we therefore present a method which allows us to calculate a pdf for a source s flux density given several measurements of the scintillated flux density .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the strong scattering regime ( a good assumption at low radio frequencies ) , where @xmath22 , the rms phase perturbation due to electron - density variations , is much greater than 1 . in this case , the amplitude fluctuations are ` saturated ' because the electric field has been sufficiently randomized to have complex gaussian statistics .",
    "we describe diss through a characteristic timescale @xmath23 and characteristic bandwidth @xmath24 .",
    "these quantities depend upon the scattering measure ( sm ) , the integrated turbulence strength ( assuming a power spectrum for electron density irregularities ) along the line of sight to the pulsar . in the strong scattering regime , and assuming a uniform distribution of scattering material and a kolmogorov power spectrum , @xmath23 and @xmath24 scale with sm , observing frequency , distance , and pulsar velocity as ( @xcite ; @xcite ) = 10 ^ 2.52 ^ 1.2sm^-0.6v^-1 s , [ eq : scinttime ] = 10 ^ -0.775 ^ 4.4sm^-1.2d^-1 khz [ eq : scintbw ] where @xmath25 is the radio frequency in ghz , sm is the scattering measure in kpc m@xmath26 , @xmath27 is the pulsar s transverse velocity in km s@xmath3 , and d is its distance in kpc .",
    "the scaling is such that a distant source with high velocity observed at a low frequency has a _",
    "shorter _ characteristic bandwidth and timescale than a nearby , low velocity source observed at high frequency .",
    "once we have characterized the diss properties of a source ( through a measurement or an estimation using eqs .",
    "[ eq : scinttime ] and  [ eq : scintbw ] ) , we calculate the posterior pdf of the intrinsic source flux density given several measurements of the scintillated flux density using the method described in appendix b. the source s intrinsic flux density , @xmath15 , is modulated by interstellar scintillations by a factor @xmath28 , so that the measured flux density , @xmath18 , is f = gs + n , where @xmath29 , the additive noise , may include both radiometer noise and radio frequency interference .",
    "we note that this additive noise model holds only for the case where the time - bandwidth ( @xmath30 ) product of the measurements ( ie .",
    "integration time @xmath31 times bandwidth @xmath32 ) is large , @xmath33 . in the strong scattering regime , the scintillation time - bandwidth product , @xmath34 , which is the characteristic size of a `` scintle '' in the @xmath35 plane , may or may not be much larger than @xmath30 for the measurement . when the time - bandwidth product of the measurement is _ smaller",

    "b0950 + 08 is much closer to earth , so its time - bandwidth product @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "although this pulsar is likely in the transition regime from weak to strong scattering , @xmath41 will approximate an exponential and will have a similarly long tail .    using the method of appendix b",
    ", we calculate the pdfs for the intrinsic source fluxes of these pulsars given by our measurements . in figure 5 , we plot @xmath53 , where @xmath15 is the intrinsic phase - averaged flux density . for b0329 + 54",
    ", the pdf of the intrinsic source flux density is strongly peaked at the measured flux density , and follows a roughly gaussian distribution away from the peak . for b0950 + 08 , the pdf for the intrinsic source flux density again peaks at the measured flux , but is characterized by a broad exponential tail .",
    "we can calculate confidence intervals for the flux densities of these pulsars from their pdfs . for b0329 + 54 ,",
    "the 95% confidence interval is 968 mjy @xmath54 1190 mjy , while for b0950 + 08 , the 95% confidence interval is 5.4 mjy @xmath54 880.1 mjy .",
    "we note that these pulsars predicted 317 mhz fluxes from the princeton pulsar catalog ( @xcite ) 400 mhz fluxes and measured spectral indices ( @xcite ) are 1890 mjy for psr b0329 + 54 and 590 mjy for psr b0950 + 08 . while the predicted flux for psr b0329 + 54 lies outside of our confidence interval , this discrepancy is consistent with the @xmath55 modulations due to refractive interstellar scintillation that have been measured for this pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "refractive iss is probably also important in modulating the flux of psr b0950 + 08 , although its predicted flux does fall within our confidence interval .      because the scintillation bandwidth and timescale have not been measured for geminga , we use eqs .",
    "[ eq : scinttime ] and  [ eq : scintbw ] to predict the characteristic timescale and bandwidth given our observing frequency , geminga s measured distance , and the sm predicted from the tc model .",
    "for geminga , we estimate sm @xmath56 kpc m@xmath26 and , from eq .",
    "[ eq : scintbw ] , @xmath57 1.5 mhz . given geminga s transverse velocity of @xmath58 km s@xmath3 , eq .",
    "[ eq : scinttime ] yields @xmath59 275 s. therefore , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and we expect statistical independence between measurements . applying eq .",
    "[ eq : totalint ] to the distributions for @xmath62 ( see figure 1 ) , we calculate @xmath53 for each of the 7 observations individually .",
    "these pdfs are plotted in figure 6 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "[ eq : likenorm ] and  [ eq : totalint ] , we may use all 7 geminga observations to calculate a composite pdf , shown in figure 7 .",
    "this pdf does peak at a non - zero value of @xmath15 .",
    "however , as shown in figure 10 ( see appendix a ) , the pdfs of simulated noise often peak at non - zero values .",
    "we note that the rms noise levels in the geminga pulse profiles are roughly equivalent to those of the simulated profiles in this figure .",
    "in addition , we expect more structure in the geminga profiles due to the large amount of radio frequency interference at 317 mhz . furthermore , the marginalized pdfs for pulse width and phase for each of the 7 geminga scans do not peak at a consistent value of these quantities , as expected for a real pulsar .",
    "we therefore treat our result as an upper limit and calculate a 95% confidence upper limit to geminga s pulsed flux of 3.0 mjy .",
    "the results so far have assumed that the pulse width is completely unknown .",
    "we have also calculated upper limits assuming reasonable values for geminga s pulse width .",
    "if we assume geminga s radio pulse has the same width ( roughly 180@xmath63 ) as its gamma - ray pulse , we calculate a 95% confidence upper limit to the pulsed flux density of 4.0 mjy .",
    "however , except in the case of the crab , the radio pulse widths of the known egret pulsars are much narrower than the gamma - ray pulse widths .",
    "for this reason , we also calculate an upper limit for a pulse width of 25@xmath63 ( calculated assuming the @xmath64 scaling of pulse width @xmath65 with period @xmath66 given by biggs ( 1990 ) ) of 1.6 mjy .",
    "we note that the distribution of material along the line of sight will most likely _ not _ be uniform , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 may be somewhat different from those predicted by eqs .",
    "[ eq : scinttime ] and  [ eq : scintbw ] .",
    "we therefore explore what happens in the limiting case where the scintillation timescale is _ longer _ than the 9-hr total timescale of our observations . for this case",
    ", we use eq .",
    "[ eq : likeid ] to calculate the pdf for intrinsic source flux density given all 7 observations , again integrating over the pdfs of figure 1 .",
    "the resultant pdf for this limiting case , also plotted in figure 7 , is much broader than that derived assuming statistically independent scintillations .",
    "the 95% confidence upper limit on geminga s pulsed flux for this case is 13.9 mjy .",
    "however , for the scintillation timescale to be as large as 9 hrs , the scattering measure would have to be 10@xmath67 times smaller than that estimated using the tc model .",
    "alternatively , a timescale this long could also be explained by a thin screen located only 0.021 pc from the observer ( @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , both of these scenarios are very improbable , and the true 95% upper limit is likely very close to 3 mjy .",
    "comparing our 3 mjy upper limit to geminga s flux density at 317 mhz with the mean flux density of 60 mjy reported by malofeev & malov at 102 mhz , we calculate a _ lower _",
    "limit on the spectral index of geminga of @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , comparable to the spectral index of the crab .",
    "if the spectral index of geminga is indeed this high , it would be extreme , as the crab and geminga pulsars have quite different ages , spin periods , and spin - down rates .    in figure 8",
    ", we plot our upper limit along with previously measured upper limits and detections . unfortunately , while there have been many radio searches for geminga , there are few published upper limits .",
    "this is partly due to geminga s migrating gamma - ray positional error box .",
    "for example , boriakoff et al . ( 1984 ) searched for radio pulsars in geminga s error box , determined from cos b data , but did not cover the current , well - determined position .",
    "of special interest is the recent non - detection of geminga at both 35 and 327 mhz by ramachandran et al .",
    "while their quoted 327 mhz upper limit of 0.3 mjy is much lower than ours , the rms sensitivities of our 7-hr vla observation and their 6-hr ooty observation are very similiar . for consistency ,",
    "we have plotted the upper limit obtained through applying our method to their data , taking into account scintillation and the unknown width and phase of geminga s pulse .",
    "the reason for geminga s radio weakness is still debatable .",
    "one explanation is that some gamma - ray pulsars simply do not emit at radio energies .",
    "halpern & ruderman ( 1993 ) suggest that geminga s radio emission is quenched by the copious pair production in the inner magnetosphere .",
    "however , the transient dips in geminga s soft x - ray profile ( @xcite ) suggest that the processes responsible for supplying @xmath70 to the inner magnetosphere may be variable .",
    "because the radio silence will be occasionally broken as this @xmath70 quenching plasma clears away , we may expect geminga to be a _",
    "transient _ radio emitter .",
    "if geminga continues to be the only high - energy pulsar found to exhibit this transient phenomenon , studying its x - ray properties may be useful for determining if and why radio emission is suppressed .    a more likely explanation for geminga s radio weakness is simply that there is some misalignment between the gamma - ray and radio pulsar beams .",
    "geminga s pulse shape in gamma - rays ( like that of the crab and vela pulsars ) is broad and double - peaked , suggesting an origin in the `` outer gaps '' of the pulsar magnetosphere near the light cylinder .",
    "because radio emission is expected to be associated with the open field line region centered on the magnetic poles , it is possible that our line - of - sight intersects the gamma - ray beam only .",
    "romani & yadigaroglu ( 1995 ) , using the outer gap model for pulsar gamma - ray emission , have modeled the orientation and size of the radio and gamma - ray pulsar beams given radio and gamma - ray data on known pulsars .",
    "they find that , because the gamma - ray beam is much wider than the radio beam , 45% of young pulsars will be detected _ only _ at high energies , while only 19% of young pulsars will be detected at both radio and gamma - ray energies . scaling from the 5 egret detections of radio pulsars ,",
    "romani & yadigaroglu expect 12 nonradio pulsars to be visible in gamma - rays at flux levels comparable to the radio selected objects .",
    "this implies that _ most _ of the @xmath21 20 unidentified galactic egret sources are young radio - quiet or radio - weak pulsars like geminga .",
    "this is consistent with other studies which find that the properties , such as flux variability ( @xcite ) and spectral index ( @xcite ) , of many unidentified sources are similar to those of the known egret pulsars .",
    "it has also been shown ( @xcite ) that many of the unidentified sources are associated with regions of massive star formation and death , which are expected to be breeding grounds for pulsars .",
