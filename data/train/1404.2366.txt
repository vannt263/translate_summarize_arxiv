    "in recent years , device - to - device  ( d2d ) communications underlaying a cellular infrastructure have received plenty of attention from both academia and industry . with d2d communications , a user equipment  ( ue )",
    "can directly exchange data with another one in its proximity , instead of having the base station  ( bs ) as the relay node . by facilitating the reuse of cellular spectrum resources , d2d",
    "communications are promising in reducing transmission delay , increasing cell throughput , and enhancing spectrum efficiency .",
    "thus , the d2d communications have been considered as one of the key components in the next - generation broadband cellular networks , such as the third - generation partnership project  ( 3gpp ) long term evolution advanced ( lte - a ) . currently , the related work items are being standardized as lte direct in 3gpp as a release 12 feature of lte",
    ". moreover , specific business models for different d2d usage cases are also being studied by wireless operators and vendors  @xcite .",
    "one of the serious challenges for d2d communications in cellular networks is the interference between d2d ues  ( due ) and other cellular ues  ( cue ) .",
    "when a pair of dues communicate using the uplink cellular resources , the d2d communication might be affected by the simultaneous transmission between a cue and the bs . moreover , if there are multiple concurrent d2d pairs , the accumulated interference may also influence the quality of the signal received by the bs .",
    "similarly , when a d2d communication reuses the downlink resources , a transmitting due might cause reception failures of its nearby cues .",
    "it is still an open issue to effectively allocate the radio resources among dues and cues in cellular networks with underlaying d2d communications .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on an uplink resource reusing scenario , in which one cue and multiple d2d pairs are transmitting simultaneously .",
    "we first investigate the _ guard distances _ from a due to the bs , to the transmitting cue , and to other communicating d2d pairs , respectively .",
    "the basic ideas are : 1 ) a due receiver has to stay away with certain distances from the transmitting cue and other due transmitters ; and 2 ) all the due transmitters should keep a certain distance away from the bs , so that all the signal receptions can be successfully achieved . by utilizing the obtained guard distances , we then analyze the maximum number of concurrent d2d communications that can be carried within the observed cell , which is further used to study the influences of different parameters on the optimal throughput improvement .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are twofold .",
    "first , we propose a geometrical method to arrange the concurrent d2d pairs in a cell to maximize the spectrum reuse , which is based on our analysis results of the interference - free guard distances .",
    "second , we obtain the maximum throughput improvement of d2d communications in a single cell as a piecewise function of the distance between the transmitting cue and the bs , which could be further used as a basis to design the radio resource allocation schemes for the ues in a cellular network with underlaying d2d communications . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this paper is one of the first to systematically study the throughput performance with multiple concurrent d2d pairs .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : relwork ] , we summarize the related work in radio resource allocation and throughput analysis . the system model for our analysis is described in section  [ sec : sysmod ] . in section  [ sec : ana ] , the closed - form expressions of the guard distances are obtained and followed by the derivation for the bounds of the maximum throughput improvement in a single cell .",
    "simulation results are presented in section  [ sec : eval ] .",
    "a discussion about the possible future work is given in section  [ sec : dis ] , and section  [ sec : con ] finally concludes this paper .",
    "the idea of capturing the benefits of the proximity between network nodes has been studied to improve cellular network s radio coverage  @xcite , traffic balance  @xcite , user fairness  @xcite , and other performance metrics for quite a long time .",
    "however , these efforts usually assume that the local data exchanges utilize an unlicensed frequency band , such as the 2.4 ghz industry science medicine ( ism ) spectrum , rather than reusing the spectrum resources allocated for cellular networks .",
    "given that the quality of service ( qos ) in the unlicensed spectrum may fail to be controlled or guaranteed , the underlaying d2d communications are more preferable to both service providers and device vendors .",
    "currently , there are multiple ongoing research topics in this area , including mode selection  @xcite , scheduling  @xcite , resource management  @xcite , etc .",
    "a detailed survey of the design challenges and potential solutions for the d2d communications can be found in @xcite . in this paper , we are interested in the effect of interference on throughput performance of the underlaying d2d networks . to control /",
    "coordinate the interference and improve the throughput performance , existing work can be roughly classified into two categories , including radio resource allocation and the theoretical analysis of the achievable performance bounds .    for the radio resource allocation , one of the important early work is @xcite , in which an initial framework for the d2d communications in the cellular networks was proposed .",
    "according to its simulation results , a d2d communication could be enabled without degrading the performance of the cellular network , even in an interference - limited scenario with heavy traffic load . in @xcite , by assuming that the radio resource managements were adopted for both the cellular and d2d connections , three possible resource allocation methods , i.e. , non - orthogonal , orthogonal , and cellular operation , were studied . moreover , two optimization cases , greedy sum - rate maximization and sum - rate maximization with rate constraints , were also analyzed in  @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a radio resource allocation scheme was proposed for d2d communications underlaying cellular networks with fractional frequency .",
    "the different frequency bands utilized by dues and cues were chosen according to whether the ues were located in the inner or outer region of a cell , so that the interference could be greatly alleviated . in one of the most recent work  @xcite , under the power control constraint , the spatial distribution of a d2d network s transmission power and the signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr )",
    "were derived based on the homogeneous poisson point processes ( ppp ) . in general ,",
    "most of the existing resource management schemes focused on the scenario that each cell had one d2d pair and one cue ( or multiple ones when directional antennas were applied at the bs ) transmitting at the same time .",
    "the proper design guidelines to support multiple concurrent d2d pairs within one cell are still unclear for the radio resource allocation schemes .    for the theoretical analysis of the achievable performance bounds , available results are relatively fewer . in @xcite",
    ", the uplink capacity gain was derived when one d2d link was enabled in an fdd cdma - based cellular cell . in @xcite , an interference - limited area  ( ila )",
    "control scheme was proposed to manage the interference from cues to a d2d transaction when multiple antennas were used by the bs . by analyzing the coverage of ila ,",
    "a lower bound of the ergodic capacity was also obtained for dues using uplink cellular radio resources .",
    "after that , a similar approach was extended to the downlink resources sharing scenario in @xcite . in @xcite , the maximum achievable transmission capacity , which was defined as the spatial density of successful transmissions per unit area ,",
    "was analyzed for the hybrid d2d and cellular network through stochastic geometry .",
    "however , due to the inevitable interference accumulated at the bs , most of the existing analytical results assuming a single d2d pair in a cellular network can not be directly extended to a scenario with multiple coexisting d2d pairs .",
    "therefore , the performance of d2d communications in the latter is still an under - developed issue , which could further improve the spectrum efficiency and increase the cellular network throughput .    to make up the shortage of performance bounds analysis for d2d communications in cellular networks , some useful insights might be obtained from the existing results of the protocol interference model ( prim ) and the physical interference model ( phim)-based capacity analyses , which were mainly initialized from @xcite . by introducing a spatial protection margin @xmath0 ,",
    "prim defines a location - based condition for successful communications between a single node pair .",
    "the condition could be applied to all the concurrent node pairs in the network to obtain the capacity bounds for different network settings , for example , the effect of directional antennas on network capacity bounds were studied in  @xcite . however",
    ", prim does not take into account the aggregated interference , which happens to be vital for the d2d scenario , e.g. , the constraint on the total interference power accumulated at the bs . comparing with prim ,",
    "phim is based on the power capture model , and focuses on the aggregated interference on a specific receiver . by assuming the interference power follows a gaussian distribution , the general phim was proposed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , a series of graph - based interference models have also been developed based on phim for different research purposes and network scenarios @xcite .",
    "however , the higher computation complexity , which is caused by calculating the sum of all the undesired signals , might also prevent the application of phim on large and complicated network scenarios , e.g. , the d2d communications deployed in an irregular network area .",
    "in this paper , we aim to study the network throughput improvement when multiple d2d communications coexist with a single cue - bs communication . ] . to develop a tractable model of d2d communications in a single cell",
    ", it is assumed that the coverage area of a bs is a disk with radius @xmath1 .",
    "two working modes , cue and due , are available for each ue . in the cue mode , a ue sends packets via the bs ; while ues in the due mode exchange packets via direct connections in an ad hoc style utilizing the uplink radio resource  @xcite .",
    "the case when the downlink radio resource is reused , which can still be analyzed by the method developed in this paper , will be one of our research issues in the near future .    to describe a signal s power attenuation ,",
    "a general path - loss model is applied here as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the transmission power , @xmath4 is the average received signal power at distance @xmath5 from the transmitter , @xmath6 is the path - loss constant determined by the hardware features of the transceivers , and @xmath7 is the path - loss exponent depending on the propagation environment @xcite . for better readability , we use @xmath8 to represent the path - loss ratio of the transmission power at distance @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are used to represent the different physical characteristics and constraints of cue - bs and due - due links , respectively .",
    "this model can be extended to study the instantaneous throughput or throughput distribution by introducing a lognormal random variable representing the channel shadowing effect , which will be another topic of our future research .    since a cue s transmission",
    "can always be coordinated by its bs , power control schemes could be implemented to achieve different design goals . for compensating the near - far effect ,",
    "we assume that the average received signal power at a bs is controlled to the same level , @xmath11 , for each cue  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the maximum cue transmission power @xmath12 is utilized when the cue is located at the boundary of the cell , and @xmath13 .",
    "compared with the cue - bs connection , the coordinations among d2d communications are usually limited , and are more vulnerable to the unexpected channel conditions .",
    "thus , we assume that all the d2d communications are carried with a fixed transmission power @xmath14 and a constant bit rate @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , we define that a d2d connection will only be established when the distance @xmath16 between the two dues is within a predefined range @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is a very short distance representing the minimum physical separation between any two ues .    with multiple d2d pairs reusing the uplink resource in a cell",
    ", interference occurs between due and due , cue and due , due and bs .",
    "for successful receptions , we assume that two predefined signal to interference ratio ( sir ) thresholds should be achieved at a due as  @xmath19 , and at the bs as @xmath20 , respectively . to guarantee @xmath19 ,",
    "a due receiver should stay at a guard distance @xmath21 away from all the other transmitting dues , and at a guard distance @xmath22 away from the transmitting cue to limit the received total interference .",
    "similarly , to satisfy the required receiving sir @xmath20 at the bs , there should also be a minimum guard distance @xmath23 between the bs and all the due transmitters , which limits the number of concurrent d2d pairs in a cell and the total interference accumulated at bs .",
    "in addition , considering that d2d communications are usually bidirectional ( e.g. , service discovery , data transmission , and ack feedback ) and the distance between a d2d pair is typically short , the transmitter and receiver of will not be distinguished in our interference analysis , section  [ sec : simu - c ] . ] .",
    "therefore , the _ exclusive region _ ( er ) occupied by a d2d pair with link distance @xmath24 can be modeled as a disk with radius @xmath25 . due to the possible difference of @xmath24 for each communicating pair ,",
    "@xmath26 could be different for each er . moreover , we define @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for concurrent transmissions , two d2d pairs ers should not overlap with each other .",
    "the three guard distances and ers are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model3r ] , which demonstrates a part of a cell with the coexistence of of one cue and several d2d pairs . for an er",
    ", we use a grey disk to illustrate an imaginary _ hard core _ , whose diameter is the distance between the d2d pair . since the boundary of a hard core represent all the possible relative positions of the d2d pair as long as @xmath24 is fixed , as shown in the figure , neither the bs guard region , which is a disk centered at the bs with radius @xmath23 , nor the cue s impact disk , which is a disk centered at the cue with radius @xmath22 , could intersect with any d2d pair s hard core .",
    "moreover , all the hard cores have to stay inside the cell s coverage area .",
    "before investigating the bounds of the throughput improvement brought by the d2d communications in a single cell , the three guard distances @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath21 will be determined for a reasonable setting first in this subsection .",
    "when no cue is considered , for a due node , the worst interfered scenario happens when : a ) its link distance reaches the maximum allowable value @xmath29 ; and b ) it is affected by the maximum possible number of nearby d2d pairs . owing to that @xmath21 is a fixed parameter for all the d2d pairs , the maximum number of ers surrounding the observed d2d pair is obtained when @xmath30 holds for all the other d2d pairs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gd ] . with acceptable accuracy ,",
    "only the surrounding d2d pairs in the first layer , which generate the majority part of the total interference , are considered here .",
    "the number of the first layer surrounding d2d pairs could be calculated as @xmath31 where the function @xmath32 in the denominator is used to calculate the length of the arcs @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig : gd ] .",
    "the detailed expression of function @xmath32 is given in the appendix .",
    "since @xmath21 is the minimum distance between the interfered due and all the interferers , the transmission bit rate @xmath15 should be at least higher than the bit rate obtained in the worst interfered scenario , in which all the @xmath34 surrounding transmitters are located with distance @xmath21 to the observed due , as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the system bandwidth , and @xmath37 is the one - sided spectral density of additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "finally , @xmath38 could be calculated by combining with the path - loss model in ( [ eq : path - loss ] ) as @xmath39    { \\frac{\\beta ' \\ , n_\\mathrm{s}\\ , p_{\\mathrm{t , d}}\\,(2^{r_b / w } -1 ) }   { \\beta ' p_{\\mathrm{t , d } } - n_0 w \\,d_{\\max}^{\\,\\alpha ' }   ( 2^{r_b / w }    -1)}}\\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the path - loss parameters associated with @xmath10 .",
    "based on the system model , no matter how many d2d pairs can be activated simultaneously , the effects of a cue transmission s interference on each communicating due node are independent of each other .",
    "suppose a cue node is located with distance @xmath42 to its bs , then its transmission power @xmath43 can be represented as @xmath44 similarly , considering the sir constraint at due , we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the distance between the cue and the interfered due node . for a cue ,",
    "the worst case is that the being affected d2d pair has the longest link distance ( @xmath47 ) , which should be used to determine @xmath22 for system setting . by combining the path - loss model in ( [ eq : path - loss ] ) and ignoring the small difference between the path - loss exponent of the cue - bs and due - due links @xcite , @xmath22",
    "could be obtained as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a function of the due transmission power @xmath50 as @xmath51{\\delta_{\\mathrm{d } } p_{\\mathrm{t , c_{\\max } } } } } { r_{\\mathrm{c } } } \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[\\alpha]{p_\\mathrm{t , d }   } } \\quad.\\ ] ]      for an observed bs , the worst interfered case happens when the number of d2d paris in its cell reaches the theoretical upper bound , which means : a ) the cue s impact disk is fully included in the bs guard region , so it has no negative effect on any d2d communication ; and b ) the condition @xmath52 holds for each d2d pair , so each er only occupies the smallest area .",
    "however , accurately calculating the maximum number of disks that could be arranged into a given ring area without intersection is still an open issue currently , which is known as a case of the _ circle / sphere packing _ problem in geometry @xcite .    to solve the problem , two hexagons @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "are used to approximate the bs s guard disk and the cell coverage area , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hex - appox ] . then the ring area is transferred as the grey region consisting of six identical isosceles trapezoids with @xmath55 base angles .",
    "the side length of hexagon @xmath53 is set to @xmath56 , which means that the hexagon is circumscribed with the guard disk of bs , so the sir requirement @xmath20 can still be achieved . for the hexagon @xmath54 , we let the six trapezoids total area in fig .",
    "[ fig : hex - appox ] equal the ring area determined by @xmath23 and @xmath1 , so its side length @xmath57 has to satisfy : @xmath58 therefore , @xmath59    due to the symmetry feature , we can focus on one third of the approximated ring area initially , e.g. , the polygon region @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig : hex - appox ] . according to the system model ,",
    "the most compact way to arrange d2d pairs is to locate the first er s center on line segment @xmath61 , while node @xmath62 is on the boundary of the er s hard core , and arrange other d2d ers without overlapping along three directions @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , as shown in the figure , @xmath66 , and @xmath65 ( from the cell boundary to the inside ) . for a network area large enough",
    ", these two arrangements lead to almost identical results , so we only consider the previous arranging method in this paper . ] . note that , this arrangement is identical to the _ hexagon packing _ , which is the densest packing possible on a flat surface @xcite . in this way",
    ", the maximum layers of d2d ers that could be arranged in a trapezoid area can be calculated as @xmath67 according to the geometry , in the observed polygon region @xmath60 , the number of due ers that could be placed in the @xmath68-th layer can be calculated as @xmath69 where @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath71 represents the number of the ers in the @xmath68-th layer that could be arranged within the trapezoid @xmath72 , excluding the ones on the boundary @xmath61 , and @xmath73 represents the number of the ers in the @xmath68-th layer that could be arranged within the trapezoid @xmath74 , including the ones on the boundary @xmath61 . note",
    "that , when ers are arranged near the two side boundaries of the observed polygon region ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , if more than half an er s hard core could be arranged within the boundary , the er should be counted on one side only .",
    "then the double counting errors will not happen .",
    "therefore , the maximum number of ers that could be arranged in the ring area determined by @xmath23 and @xmath1 can be approximated as follows @xmath77    once @xmath78 is obtained , the total interference generated by d2d communications accumulating at the bs can be calculated as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 represent the corresponding distance between bs and the center of the @xmath82-th er in the @xmath68-th layer within @xmath72 , and the center of the @xmath83-th er in the @xmath68-th layer within @xmath74 , respectively , which are used to approximate the distance between bs and transmitting dues . because @xmath84 , this approximation is acceptable . @xmath80 and @xmath81 could be calculated according to the law of cosine as follows @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .    due to the sir requirement",
    ", we also have @xmath89 by combining equations ( [ eq : nr])([eq : sirb ] ) and the definition of @xmath90 , @xmath23 can be obtained in a numerical way ( e.g. , by the bisection search algorithm ) .",
    "another byproduct here is that , when the cue s impact disk is fully covered by the bs guard region , the upper bound of the maximum throughput improvement could be calculated as @xmath91      it is clear that the actual capacity improvement is determined by the number of concurrent transmitting d2d pairs in the network . in a general scenario , the transmitting cue s impact disk could move out the guard region of the bs , so the total area for deploying non - overlapped d2d ers is reduced , which may further affect the maximum throughput improvement in the cell . due to the circular symmetry",
    ", a cartesian coordinate system can be built with its origin at the observed bs , and the cue s impact disk can always be aligned with the @xmath92-axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : general ] , where @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "according to the system model , the hard cores can not intersect with neither the bs guard region nor cross the cell boundary , therefore , the actual area for deploying possible d2d ers is a slightly larger ring region with inner radius @xmath94 and outer radius @xmath95 .",
    "recall that @xmath96 , so it is possible that the cue s impact disk might cross both the boundaries of bs guard region and the cell coverage area , which is called _",
    "double - crossing _ here .",
    "when @xmath49 is relatively small , the length of the cue s impact disk s diameter may still be shorter than @xmath97 when the impact disk is just to move out the cell s coverage area , which means the double - crossing never happens .",
    "therefore , the range of @xmath49 for no double - crossing could be written as @xmath98 $ ] , where @xmath99 could be derived by the critical condition mentioned above as @xmath100 when @xmath101 , if @xmath22 is still shorter than @xmath97 given the cue is on the boundary of the bs s guard region , the double - crossing will only happen for a specific range of @xmath102 , and the cue s impact disk will not intersect with the bs s guard region anymore .",
    "therefore , the second threshold for @xmath49 can be obtained as @xmath103 finally , when @xmath104 , once the double - crossing happens , it will last until @xmath105 .",
    "based on these analyses , the area for deploying d2d ers could be obtained as a piece - wise function @xmath106 shown as below .",

    "therefore , the maximum number of concurrent d2d pairs that could be arranged within a single cell , when @xmath49 and @xmath102 are given , can be approximated by @xmath131 note that @xmath26 has two extreme situations ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 as defined earlier ) , which are corresponding to the minimum and maximum area an er could cover , respectively .",
    "therefore , for the general scenario , we could obtain the upper and lower bounds of the maximum throughput improvement in a cell as @xmath134 and @xmath135",
    "all our simulation results are obtained using matlab .",

    "the path - loss ratios are set as @xmath141 ( db ) for the bs - cue link , and @xmath142 ( db ) for the due - due link , so the path - loss exponent @xmath143 . in the following part of this section ,",
    "the simulation results are demonstrated in groups to show the effect of different parameters on the throughput improvement by d2d communications .",
    "intuitively , increasing due s transmission power @xmath146 could support higher bit rate @xmath15 with the same guard distance @xmath21 .",
    "however , the superposed interference at bs generated by dues also increases with @xmath146 . as a result ,",
    "the guard distance @xmath23 is enlarged and the maximum number of concurrent d2d pairs in the observed cell is reduced .",
    "therefore , for a given system setting , there should be an optimal range of @xmath146 to obtain a relatively good performance improvement .",
    "when the cue s impact disk is within the guard region of the bs , the upper bound for the maximum throughput of d2d communication @xmath145 could be obtained from ( [ eq : upper1 ] ) , and the changing patterns of @xmath145 with different @xmath50 and @xmath147 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simu1 ] .",
    "as demonstrated in this figure , when @xmath50 is relatively low , higher @xmath147 may lead to a lower maximum throughput improvement .",
    "this special phenomenon can be reproduced as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simu1-ex ] , which illustrates one third of the ring area determined by the same @xmath1 but slightly different bs guard distances , and explained as follow .",
    "when @xmath146 is fixed , the rise of @xmath148 will contribute to the increase of the total tolerable interference signal power at bs , which is represented as the decline of bs s guard distance @xmath23 .",
    "however , since all the d2d pairs ers have to be placed without overlapping while all the hard cores have to stay within the ring area , decreasing @xmath23 means fewer ers could be arranged in the first inner layer of the ring area .",
    "moreover , the increased area is accumulated at the outer ring , but the area will not be able to be utilized until one extra er could be located in .",
    "therefore , increasing @xmath149 may not directly result in the rise of @xmath145 .",
    "in addition to this interesting result , as we can see in fig . [",
    "fig : simu1 ] , larger @xmath147 requires a higher @xmath50 and offers a wider varying range to obtain the optimal maximum throughput improvement .",

    "when @xmath152mw , the optimal range of @xmath50 is changed to about @xmath153 $ ] mw . moreover , if @xmath50 keeps growing after exceeding its optimal range , the total throughput improvement shrinks dramatically .",
    "this is because when all d2d pairs are constrained near the boundary of a cell area , a slight change in @xmath50 will cause a striking variation on both @xmath23 and the maximum number of concurrent d2d pairs .",
    "the relationship among @xmath23 , @xmath50 , and @xmath147 is also demonstrated in fig . [",
    "fig : simu1b ] .",
    "as stated earlier , a higher @xmath144 leads to a shorter @xmath23 , before @xmath23 reaches to @xmath1 .",
    "besides , the increase of due transmission power leads to the increase of @xmath23 , which limits the total number of d2d pairs in a cell and the total interference at the bs .",
    "in particular , @xmath23 rises significantly after a specific value of @xmath50 , which matches the tendency shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simu1 ] .      similarly as the pervious evaluation group , fig .",
    "[ fig : sim2 ] shows the upper bound for the maximum throughput of d2d communications varying with the changed due transmission power and the expected bit rate , when the cue s impact disk is fully included in the bs s guard region . generally , when @xmath50 is fixed , a higher bit rate @xmath15 requires a longer guard distance @xmath21 between due nodes , which is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim2-rd ] .",
    "the raise of @xmath15 increases the area of a d2d pair s er , but the total throughput could still be raised , even though the maximum number of concurrent communicating d2d pairs in the network is reduced . similar to the previous group , when the due transmission power is monotonically increasing for a given @xmath15 , the throughput improvement grows to its optimal first , and then drops with a substantial amount . it is worth mentioning that the optimal maximum throughput improvement could be obtained with a range rather than one specific value of @xmath50 .",
    "this is due to that the number of maximum concurrent d2d pairs does not have a continuous linear relationship with other system parameters .",
    "therefore , the changing of @xmath145 is shown as a step function .",
    "the effects of @xmath50 and @xmath15 on the due guard distance @xmath21 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim2-rd ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath21 is slowly decreased while @xmath50 increases , which provides stronger support for satisfying the sir requirement of dues .",
    "however , the major dominator for @xmath21 is @xmath15 in our simulation .      in a more general scenario",
    ", the cue could appear in any location within its bs s coverage area .",
    "as described in section [ sec : general bounds ] , since a cue s impact disk will impair some d2d pairs transmissions , the maximum throughput will be affected by @xmath102 , which is the distance between bs and the transmitting cue .",
    "based on ( [ eq : upper2 ] ) , the general upper bound of the maximum throughput improvement @xmath154 is calculated , and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim4 ] to demonstrate its relationship with @xmath102 and @xmath146 .",
    "it is clear that the upper bound of the maximum throughput is independent of @xmath102 at the very beginning , which represents the scenario that the cue s impact disk is fully included within bs s guard region .",
    "note that the length of the flat part of curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim4 ] is proportional to @xmath155 .",
    "since a higher @xmath155 indicates a larger @xmath23 as we discussed in the previous subsection , the cue s impact disk can still be incorporated within the bs s guard region even with a larger @xmath102 .",
    "after that , the cue s impact disk starts to partially intersect with the ring area determined by @xmath1 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the maximum number of d2d pairs shrinks , and so does the maximum throughput improvement . compared with the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim2 ] , the simulation results for the maximum throughput in this figure are slightly higher , due to the different methods of determining the maximum number of d2d pairs in ( [ eq : nmax ] ) and ( [ eq : nmax - conti ] ) .",
    "however , the difference is merely the deviation about one or two d2d pairs , so it is still acceptable .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : sim2 ] , when the cue s effect is excluded , the maximum throughput improvement in a cell is developing as @xmath146 rises from 0.6  mw to 0.8  mw .",
    "but when @xmath156 is further increased to 0.9  mw , the maximum throughput falls to a relatively low level .",
    "it should be noted that all the results above are obtained by setting @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the maximum number of d2d pairs in the network reaches its upper bound .",
    "when it comes to the other extreme scenarios i.e. , @xmath157 , the obtained maximum throughput improvement turns out to be a lower bound .",
    "both the upper and lower bounds of the maximum throughput improvement of a single cell are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim5 ] .",
    "moreover , the average maximum throughput , with identical system setting but variable @xmath16 for each d2d pair , is also obtained with different values of @xmath102 . as depicted in the figure , the curve for the average performance lies between the two bounds and closer to the lower bound .",
    "currently , the probability distribution of @xmath24 is unknown , which is usually determined by the different application and user scenarios , so we could not provide a closed - form expression of the average maximum throughput improvement , but this will be addressed in our follow - on work . besides , the simulation results obtained by rotating each due s role between transmitter and receiver are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim5 ] .",
    "it is clear that there is no obvious difference between the rotated and non - rotated results .",
    "this verifies the assumption that , the transmitter and receiver of a d2d pair could be treated indiscriminately in our analysis , which was mentioned in section  [ sec : sysmod ] .    considering that the number and locations of ues in a cell may statistically follow certain distributions , we also simulated the throughput improvement of d2d communications in a cell when the network nodes are distributed by following the poisson point process ( ppp ) with varied density  @xmath158 , which is increased from @xmath159 to @xmath160 nodes / m@xmath161 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim - ppp ] , for different @xmath158 , the general pattern that the total throughput improvement is decreased with increased @xmath102 still holds .",
    "when @xmath158 is relatively low , the effect of @xmath102 , which demonstrates the change of network area left for d2d communications , on the throughput improvement is not that obvious .",
    "this is because that , when all the ues are sparsely deployed , a d2d communication can always be successfully finished with high probability , as long as the distance between the due transmitter and receiver is within the predefined interval @xmath162 $ ] . on the other hand , when the density @xmath158 is larger than a threshold ( e.g. , when @xmath163 and @xmath164 nodes / m@xmath161 ) , the number of concurrent d2d pairs in the network ( and also the throughput improvement ) is then constrained by the area possible for arranging d2d ers , which means the changing of node density or distribution will not affect the performance anymore . as shown in the figure , for network scenarios with high ppp density , the maximum throughput improvement is almost identical to the average results illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim5 ] , in which all the network nodes are uniformly distributed with a high density .",
    "therefore , for a given network setting , there should always be a optimal range of network density to establish d2d communications more efficiently .",
    "it is clear that the model and analyses mentioned above are only focusing on a single cell with uplink resource reusing between one cue and multiple dues .",
    "however , the general method developed in this paper could be extended to a series of more complicated but also important scenarios .",
    "currently , we are working on the following topics , and have obtained some interesting results on them .    first , for more general network modeling , multiple cues should coexist in the uplink transmission scenario . due to the fact that orthogonal channel resources are allocated to different cues",
    ", the dues reusing different uplink resource will not interfere with each other .",
    "therefore , the multiple cues scenario is theoretically equivalent to the combination of multiple independent single - cue scenarios .",
    "however , the dynamic channel allocation work for all dues becomes difficult , and directly influents the final network performance improvement .",
    "we will focus on this in the near future .",
    "second , for a large network with multiple cells , which shapes a hexagon grid , the two - hexagon - approximation used in calculating @xmath23 can be simplified to approximate the bs s guard region only . moreover , if each cell is further divided into several sectors to utilize more complicated resource reusing scheme , the only change in the analytical method is that the possible interference generated from the neighboring cells with the same resource should be considered .",
    "however , the symmetry feature in hexagon and the resource reusing pattern could greatly simplify the entire analyzing process .",
    "third , if the d2d communications reuse the downlink resources rather than the uplink ones discussed in this paper , the interfering target is changed to the cue(s ) in the cell , and the bs s transmission may also generate considerable interference to all the due receivers .",
    "therefore , the guard distance - based system model need to be rebuilt , but the questions can be solved similarly by starting from the simplified one cue scenario , and evolved to more complicated scenarios later .",
    "last but not least , although the throughput bounds do demonstrate the extreme situations ( e.g. , all the ers has the identical radius @xmath165 or @xmath166 ) for a communicating d2d pair , it will be even more useful if we could provide the probability distribution functions ( or probability mass functions ) of these performance metrics rather than some fixed values .",
    "however , for the generalized scenario , in which each d2d pair s transmission distance @xmath24 is randomly selected , the total number of d2d pairs in the finite cell or network region will be extremely difficult to be obtained due to the packing problem and the boundary effect .",
    "therefore , the commonly used discrete - style interference analysis method ( i.e. , obtaining each concurrent transmitter s impact on the observed receiver individually , and adding them together ) , which is also used in this paper , may not able to be applied again .",
    "this will make the derivation for the performance metrics distribution function even more complicated .",
    "interestingly , we recently found out that by borrowing ideas from physics , the effect generated by a point transmitter could be equalized to an area transmitter under some conditions and vice versa @xcite . by this means , the accumulated interference could be obtained by an area integral , so the complicated packing issues could be successfully rounded , and we could have chances to obtain the desired distribution functions in a more concise and simple way .",
    "in this paper , we have obtained the proper system settings in terms of guard distances for bs , cue , and due to ensure that multiple d2d communications could be simultaneously carried with the traditional uplink transmission from a cue to the bs .",
    "in addition , we have derived the performance bounds of the single cell s maximum throughput improvement . moreover , some discussions about the possible extensions based on the current work are also given .",
    "we believe this work will provide some useful insights for the design and optimization of more efficient d2d communications in cellular networks .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : app_1 ] , two circles with radius @xmath167 and @xmath168 are centered at @xmath169 and @xmath170 , intersecting in a lens shaped region .",
    "the intersection points abscissa can be calculated as @xmath171 and the length of the arc in the shaded region could be calculated as @xmath172 the area of the shaded region , which is determined by @xmath167 and @xmath92 , can be calculated as @xmath173 similarly , the area of the other half asymmetric lens can be represented as @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , the intersected area can be calculated as @xmath175 for a more general case , @xmath176 can be represented as below .",
