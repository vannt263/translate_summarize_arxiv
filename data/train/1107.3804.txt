    "we recall that a  map @xmath4 is _ contracting _ if its lipschitz constant @xmath5 is less than 1 .",
    "attractors of ifs appear naturally in the theory of fractals , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "topological properties of ifs - attractors were studied by m.hata in @xcite . in particular",
    ", he observed that each connected ifs - attractor @xmath0 is locally connected .",
    "the reason is that @xmath0 has property s. we recall @xcite that a metric space @xmath0 has _ property s _ if for every @xmath6 the space @xmath0 can be covered by finite number of connected subsets of diameter @xmath7 .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that a connected compact metric space @xmath0 is locally connected if and only if it has property @xmath8 if and only if @xmath0 is a _ peano continuum _ ( which means that @xmath0 is the continuous image of the interval @xmath9 $ ] ) .",
    "therefore , a compact space @xmath0 is not homeomorphic to an  ifs - attractor whenever @xmath0 is connected but not locally connected .",
    "now it is natural to ask if  there is a peano continuum homeomorphic to no ifs - attractor .",
    "an  easy answer is `` yes '' as every ifs - attractor has finite topological dimension , see @xcite .",

    "in such a way we arrive to the following question posed by m.  hata in @xcite .",
    "[ hata ] is each finite - dimensional peano continuum homeomorphic to an ifs - attractor ?    in this paper we shall give a negative answer to this question .",
    "our counterexample is a rim - finite plane peano continuum . a topological space @xmath0 is called _ rim - finite _ if it has a base of the topology consisting of open sets with finite boundaries .",
    "it follows that each compact rim - finite space @xmath0 has dimension @xmath10 .",
    "[ th1 ] there is a rim - finite plane peano continuum homeomorphic to no ifs - attractor .",
    "it should be mentioned that an example of a peano continuum @xmath11 , which is not _",
    "isometric _ to an ifs - attractor was constructed by m.kwieciski in  @xcite .",
    "however the continuum of kwieciski is _ homeomorphic _ to an ifs - attractor , so it does  not give an answer to problem  [ hata ] .",
    "in order to prove theorem  [ th1 ] we shall observe that each connected ifs - attractor has finite @xmath8-dimension .",
    "this dimension was introduced and studied in @xcite .",

    "denote by @xmath13 the smallest number of connected subsets of  diameter @xmath7 that cover the space @xmath0 and let @xmath14 for each peano continuum @xmath0 we can also consider a topological invariant @xmath15 by @xcite , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 stands for the covering topological dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "[ sdim ] assume that a connected compact metric space @xmath0 is an attractor of  an  ifs @xmath18 with contracting constant @xmath19 .",
