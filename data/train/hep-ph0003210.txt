    "the flux of solar neutrinos was first measured in the homestake mine ( see @xcite and references therein ) over thirty years ago . since then , it was realized that the measured flux was significantly suppressed with respect to theoretical predictions .",
    "more recently , a handful of different experiments have also succeeded in measuring the solar neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "all experiments measure a neutrino flux which is significantly suppressed with respect to the theoretical predictions of the most recent version of the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite .",
    "this thirty year old problem is what is referred to as the `` solar neutrino puzzle . ''",
    "there are different types of solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle . at first sight",
    ", it appears natural to suspect that the ssm predictions for the solar neutrino flux are slightly off , and/or that the experiments have underestimated their systematic effects , given that detailed models of the sun and neutrino experiments are highly non - trivial .",
    "however , ssm independent analyses of the neutrino data ( see @xcite for a particularly nice and simple example ) , together with independent experimental evidence in favour of the ssm @xcite , seem to indicate that the above solution to the puzzle is strongly disfavoured .",
    "the best solution to the solar neutrino puzzle involves extending the standard model of particle physics by assuming that the neutrinos have mass and that they mix , _",
    "i.e. , _ neutrino mass eigenstates are different from neutrino weak eigenstates .",
    "this possibility has become particularly natural in light of the recent strong evidence for @xmath6 oscillations from the atmospheric neutrino data at superkamiokande @xcite .    nonetheless , in order to firmly establish that the solution to the solar neutrino puzzle involves physics beyond the standard model ,",
    "it is necessary to come up with ssm independent , robust experimental evidence for , _",
    "e.g. _ , solar neutrino oscillations . indeed , these `` smoking gun '' signatures of solar @xmath7 oscillations are among the present goals of the superkamiokande experiment , via the measurement of the day - night asymmetry of the solar neutrino data @xcite and the recoil electron energy spectrum @xcite , and the sno experiment @xcite , via the measurement of the charged to neutral current ratio , the day - night asymmetry of the data , and the recoil electron kinetic energy spectrum",
    ".    other goals of this and the next generation of neutrino experiments are , if solar neutrino oscillations are established , to determine neutrino oscillation modes and measure masses and mixing angles .",
    "the current data allow for different @xmath0 oscillation modes and a handful of disconnected regions in the mass  mixing - angle parameter space ( see @xcite for two - flavour analyses and also @xcite for an extension to the `` dark side '' of the parameter space ) .",
    "experiments dedicated to measuring the flux of low - energy solar neutrinos ( @xmath8  kev ) are going to be extremely useful , and perhaps crucial , in order to fully solve the solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "it was recently shown that future experiments ( borexino @xcite and , perhaps , kamland @xcite ) dedicated to measuring the flux of @xmath9be neutrinos ( produced by @xmath9be+@xmath10li@xmath11 inside the sun ) should be able to establish or exclude the `` just - so '' solution @xcite to the solar neutrino puzzle via the study of the seasonal variations of the neutrino flux @xcite , and establish or exclude the low msw solution @xcite via the study of the zenith angle dependence of their data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the measurement of a sizable @xmath9be neutrino flux would significantly disfavour the sma msw @xcite solution to the solar neutrino puzzle , especially in the case of @xmath12 oscillations ( where @xmath13 is a sterile neutrino , _",
    "i.e. , _ a standard model singlet ) , and significantly constrain the ssm independent analysis , which require the flux of @xmath9be neutrinos to be virtually absent @xcite .",
    "finally , we have shown @xcite that , in the advent that the background rates at borexino and/or kamland are exceptionally low , it should be possible to measure a nonzero component of @xmath2 in the solar neutrino flux by analysing the recoil electron kinetic energy spectrum .",
    "another exciting possibility is that of measuring the `` fundamental '' @xmath14-neutrinos , which are produced in the interior of the sun by proton - proton fusion ( @xmath15h@xmath16 ) in a real time experiment .",
    "future experiments , such as hellaz , heron , lens , etc ( see @xcite for an overview ) are being designed to do just that .",
    "the flux of @xmath14-neutrinos is particularly constrained by the photon flux _",
    "i.e. , _ the sun s luminosity , which , of course , is very well measured on the earth .",
    "these lowest energy solar neutrinos ( @xmath17  kev ) are not only the most abundant ones , but also have the best known flux .",
    "their energy spectrum is also very well known , since it is dictated by the particularly well studied @xmath18 nuclear fusion reaction . among these proposed experiments ,",
    "hellaz @xcite will be able to determine the incoming neutrino energy in an event - by - event basis and have the unique opportunity of studying the solar neutrino spectrum and the recoil electron kinetic energy spectrum separately .",
    "similar to what was shown for @xmath9be neutrinos @xcite , the authors of @xcite showed that hellaz may be able to measure a nonzero component of @xmath2 in the solar @xmath14-neutrino flux by analysing the recoil electron kinetic energy spectrum independent of the ssm prediction for the solar neutrino flux .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis done in @xcite , and study the flavour composition of the flux of @xmath14 and @xmath9be neutrinos using the recoil electron kinetic energy spectrum .",
    "in particular we will address the capability of future low - energy solar - neutrino experiments to see evidence for @xmath2 coming from the sun , and , in light of such evidence , exclude more `` exotic '' oscillation scenarios , such as @xmath19 or @xmath20 oscillations .",
    "our presentation is organised as follows : sec .",
    "2 describes the flavour dependent recoil kinetic energy distribution of events at borexino and hellaz .",
    "sec .  3 presents the technique for determining the presence of @xmath2 coming from the sun , independent of the ssm prediction for the neutrino flux .",
    "we present simulations for both borexino and hellaz and show how such a determination can be improved once we take the ssm prediction for the neutrino flux into account .",
    "sec .  4 describes how the same procedure can be used to exclude the presence of antineutrinos or sterile neutrinos in the solar neutrino flux . in sec .  5 , we conclude .",
    "in this section , we discuss the differences in the recoil electron kinetic energy spectra among different neutrino species .",
    "low - energy solar neutrinos are detected via `` @xmath21''@xmath22``@xmath21 '' @xmath23 elastic scattering in the experiments which will be considered here . by `` @xmath21 '' in the previous sentence , one actually means any of @xmath24 , @xmath6 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , or @xmath28 . because @xmath6 and @xmath25 are indistinguishable as far as the reaction above is concerned , we will refer to both as @xmath6 .",
    ".coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 in eq .  [ eq_dist ] for different neutrino species . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table_f ]    finally , as argued before , we emphasise that fixing the value of the solar neutrino flux to its ssm value is a reasonable thing to do , especially for @xmath14-neutrinos . in these `` exclusion analyses ''",
    "such a procedure is even more natural , especially if one keeps in mind that a theoretical hypothesis , _ i.e. _ , @xmath31 oscillations plus the ssm computed values for the solar neutrino flux , has been `` confirmed experimentally . ''",
    "in order to unambiguously solve the solar neutrino puzzle , and to establish the oscillations of solar neutrinos ( if they occur ) , clear `` smoking gun '' signatures are required .",
    "such signatures include a large day - night effect , anomalous seasonal variations , or an obvious distortion of the neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "another unambiguous signature is a discrepancy between the number of charged current and neutral current events at sno , which can be viewed as an `` appearance '' experiment of @xmath2 .",
    "however , sno can look for this `` appearance '' signature only for @xmath32b neutrinos with @xmath33  mev and hence similar studies for lower energy neutrinos such as @xmath34be and @xmath14 neutrinos , which are less sensitive to details of the solar model , are important .    we have argued in this paper that a careful analysis of the recoil kinetic energy spectrum at borexino and hellaz serves as another `` smoking gun '' signature , in the sense that one may be able to infer , independent of the ssm prediction for the solar neutrino flux , the existence of @xmath2 coming from the sun .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasise that this is _ different _ from distortions in the incoming neutrino energy spectrum . in our case",
    "we are describing an `` appearance '' experiment , while the analysis of the neutrino energy spectrum is a ( energy dependent ) `` disappearance '' experiment .",
    "it is important to point out that , in our simple simulations , no background events were included .",
    "while this is probably an oversimplification in the case of borexino , it may well be a good approximation for hellaz",
    ". moreover future upgrades of borexino may reduce the background further according to recent encouraging progress @xcite .",
    "one should keep in mind that , even if the background rates are significant , the procedure we described may still be useful if the background can be successfully dealt with ( one should not underestimate the ability and creativity of experimental physicists ! ) .",
    "we have also included in the analysis the ssm prediction of the flux of solar neutrinos . while the results obtained in this manner are model - dependent ( they are not `` smoking gun '' signatures of neutrino oscillations ) , we found them very useful .",
    "this is a reasonable thing to do especially for @xmath14-neutrinos , whose flux is constrained well by the solar luminosity .",
    "this additional input makes the measurement of the oscillation probability more precise .",
    "finally , we have argued that , _ if the data collected at borexino and hellaz is consistent with @xmath35 oscillations _ , one can try to exclude other neutrino oscillation modes ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) using the same procedure or , at least , to set upper limits on the flux of solar antineutrinos .",
    "again we considered the possibility of constraining the solar neutrino flux to the ssm predicted value .",
    "the main result we obtained is that @xmath38 oscillations can , in general , be excluded , while the @xmath39 case is much more elusive .",
    "nonetheless , borexino should be able to exclude @xmath39 oscillations if the sma msw solution to the solar neutrino puzzle happens to be the correct one .",
