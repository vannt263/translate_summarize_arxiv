    "a major challenge of realistic model building in string theory is the construction of theories with supersymmetry breaking metastable de sitter vacua in their low - energy effective supergravity descriptions .",
    "such models are desirable as they provide a simple explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe convincingly suggested by cosmological measurements .",
    "unfortunately , de sitter vacua are notoriously difficult to obtain in a string theoretic setting .",
    "it has been made clear by the formulation of several no - go theorems ( see for example @xcite ) why naive attempts of obtaining de sitter models necessarily have to fail in many cases .",
    "a natural possibility is to generate a tiny positive cosmological constant via various types of small corrections to a leading - order minkowski vacuum @xcite .",
    "however , these attempts are often facing difficulties controlling higher - order contributions .",
    "a promising alternative approach is to start with an anti de sitter vacuum and then ` uplift ' this vacuum to a de sitter vacuum by adding additional hard supersymmetry breaking contributions @xcite .",
    "these additional contributions however often complicate the supergravity description of models obtained in this way .    despite significant progress in overcoming the difficulties of both the approaches sketched above ( see for example @xcite ) , it still appears useful  from a model building as well as from a conceptual point of view  to study situations where de sitter vacua arise naturally at the leading order in the low - energy effective supergravity description .",
    "this has for example been done for a broad range of type ii string models in ref .",
    "@xcite . a more general program to identify and study",
    "the main obstacles for the appearance of metastable de sitter vacua has been started in @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the critical parameter is the average mass of the sgoldstinos , which is not allowed to become negative .",
    "this result directly excludes leading order de sitter vacua in situations where only the dilaton or a single khler modulus contributes to supersymmetry breaking , confirming the earlier result in @xcite . the more general case where the moduli space can be factorized into one - dimensional submanifolds and thus the khler potential is given by @xmath1",
    "is also excluded by the same constraint .",
    "this analysis has been extended to two contributing khler moduli , spanning a non - trivial two - dimensional scalar manifold , in the case of compactifications of heterotic string theory as well as orientifold compactifications of type iib string theory in @xcite .",
    "the result of the analysis is an explicit topological constraint on the calabi - yau compactification manifold , which has to be fulfilled for metastable de sitter vacua to exist .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to determine how much of this analysis can be carried over to the more general case where @xmath2 khler moduli contribute to supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we only consider the case of heterotic compactifications .",
    "most of the corresponding results for orientifold compactifications of type iib string theory can be easily obtained by exploiting the duality between these two theories , which in this case simply amounts to a sign change of the relevant quantity @xmath3 defined in eq .",
    "( see for example the appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : metastability ] we briefly recall the constraint on the khler potential in metastable de sitter @xmath0-supergravity coming from the goldstino multiplet . in the low - energy effective supergravity theory obtained from heterotic string theory compactified on a calabi - yau threefold , this constraint can be encoded in the sign of a homogeneous function called @xmath3 .",
    "section [ sect : twoandthree ] studies the properties of @xmath3 and reformulates the task of determining its sign as a tensorial eigenvalue problem .",
    "this formulation is exploited to extend the known result for two - dimensional moduli spaces to the three - dimensional situation .",
    "we then apply the results of section [ sect : twoandthree ] to the study of three - dimensional examples in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing the strategy developed in @xcite to study the existence of metastable vacua with a non - negative cosmological constant in @xmath0-supergravity .",
    "we assume that vector multiplets do not play a significant role in supersymmetry breaking and therefore only consider the chiral multiplets .",
    "the lagrangian of @xmath4 chiral multiplets is completely specified by a single real function @xmath5 of the superfields @xmath6 and their conjugates @xmath7 .",
    "this function can be decomposed as @xmath8 , with the real khler potential @xmath9 and the holomorphic superpotential @xmath10 .",
    "the scalar fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 span a khler manifold with metric @xmath13 the scalar potential is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the vacuum condition then reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the khler - covariant derivative .",
    "the corresponding mass squared matrix is given by the vacuum expectation value of the hessian of the scalar potential : @xmath18 here and in the following we omit the @xmath19-brackets for quantities evaluated at the vacuum .",
    "using eq .   and",
    "eq .  , the entries of @xmath20 can be worked out and are given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the riemann tensor of the khler geometry . for the vacuum to be metastable , the mass matrix in eq .",
    "has to be positive definite .",
    "a necessary condition for this to be the case is that the upper - left block @xmath23 is positive definite .",
    "we now consider the projection of this block onto the direction of the goldstino @xmath24 in the space of chiral fermions to isolate the contribution of the goldstino multiplet to the mass matrix : @xmath25 this is a positive combination of eigenvalues of @xmath23 and should therefore be positive if @xmath20 is a positive definite matrix .",
    "using eq .   and eq .   to calculate @xmath26 more explicitly",
    ", one finds @xcite @xmath27 the superpotential in string compactifications is usually quite complicated due to all sorts of non - perturbative contributions and classical background effects .",
    "thus , we will think of the superpotential as generic , which can in principle be tuned to a suitable value .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of @xmath28 does depend on the superpotential and hence can be varied by varying @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficients in @xmath26 however depend only on the khler geometry and thus the condition @xmath29 for the existence of a supersymmetry breaking metastable vacuum does only depend on the khler potential @xmath9 and gives a constraint on possible khler potentials in viable theories .",
    "the cosmological constant in supergravity theories is given by the vacuum expectation value @xmath30 of the scalar potential .",
    "to incorporate the requirement of a non - negative cosmological constant , it is useful to rewrite @xmath26 as ( see again @xcite ) @xmath31g^ig^{{\\bar{j}}}g^mg^{\\overline{n}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sign of @xmath32 does only depend on the direction of @xmath28 , not on its length .",

    ": @xmath43 hence , a necessary condition for the existence of metastable de sitter vacua is completely encoded in the sign of @xmath32 .    as an example",

    ".      we will study compactifications of heterotic string theory on calabi - yau manifolds in the following .",
    "the low - energy limits of these theories are known to give @xmath0-supergravity models @xcite and we can therefore use the constraint described above to restrict their admissible khler potentials .",
    "we will assume that only moduli fields participate significantly in supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this assumption has attracted some phenomenological interest recently , in particular in type iib models @xcite .",
    "nonetheless it should eventually be dropped to make the analysis more universal .",
    "work in that direction has been done in @xcite by the addition of matter fields to the analysis .",
    "it has been found that the study of metastability can ( under some assumptions ) be decomposed into two ` orthogonal ' parts and one of these only involves the moduli fields .",
    "thus , the assumption in this paper is justified in the sense that the results are directly applicable to a subset of the generalized problem .    as another simplification",
    "we will also neglect bundle moduli and their interplay with the metric moduli . under this assumption , the moduli space parameterizing the deformations of the calabi - yau manifold @xmath54 consists of the deformations of the complex structure and the deformations of the khler form .",
    "locally , the moduli space then factorizes as @xmath55 where the first factor consists of the khler structure deformations and the second one of the complex structure deformations .",
    "remarkably , it turns out that both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are itself khler manifolds , not only when they are combined to give @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "we will assume that only khler moduli contribute to supersymmetry breaking .",
    "note that , as complex structure moduli and khler moduli are interchanged by mirror - symmetry ( see for example @xcite ) , the analysis for the case where only complex structure moduli take part in supersymmetry breaking would be identical .",
    "the classical volume of the calabi - yau manifold @xmath54 is denoted by @xmath59 .",
    "it holds @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the khler @xmath62-form .",
    "@xmath61 is a harmonic form and can therefore be written as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , @xmath65 is a basis of the @xmath66-cohomology group of @xmath54 . in string theory compactifications",
    "an additional geometric structure arises , a real two - form @xmath67 , which is connected to the metric by supersymmetry .",
    "as argued in @xcite , natural local coordinates on the moduli space @xmath56 are given by @xmath68 and the classical volume can be written as @xmath69 the symmetric rank-3 tensor @xmath70 is defined by @xmath71 and consists of the ( real ) calabi - yau triple intersection numbers .    in the large - volume limit ,",
    "i.e.  if the volume of the calabi - yau is large compared to the string scale , the khler potential of @xmath56 is simply given by @xmath72 note that in particular the dimension of the moduli space @xmath56 ( which we will call @xmath73 throughout this article ) is given by the @xmath62-betti number of the calabi - yau manifold @xmath54 : @xmath74 the computation of the khler metric and the riemann tensor can be found in @xcite and the result reads @xmath75 with @xmath76 note that we dropped the bar above indices referring to derivatives with respect to a complex - conjugated quantity . as the khler potential only depends on real fields , every derivative can be thought of as a derivative w.r.t .  a real quantity .",

    "have to satisfy three conditions : @xmath90    where the first condition states the positivity of the volume of the calabi - yau threefold @xmath54 , the second ensures the positivity of the kinetic energy of the moduli fields ( which is also connected to the positivity of the spacetime metric of the compactified dimensions ) and the third condition is the metastability condition .",
    "note that eq .   and",
    "eq .   are invariant under @xmath91 while eq .",
    "changes its sign .",

    "hence @xmath92 is positive definite if and only if @xmath93 for an orthogonal basis @xmath94 , of the orthogonal complement of @xmath79 .",
    "this gives @xmath95 constraints and together with eq .",
