    "an important aspect of the research on the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is the evidence for its formation in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision .",
    "a lot of fruitful theoretical investigations have been made on the signals for the existence of the qgp , for example , @xmath0 suppression @xcite , strangeness enhancement@xcite , jet quenching@xcite , dilepton and thermal photon production@xcite etc .",
    "as the electromagnetic signal of the qgp the production of the thermal photon has been investigated by calculating the compton scattering and @xmath1-annihilation processes in the qgp state@xcite .",
    "recent research@xcite shows a very interesting result : the bremsstrahlung processes in the qgp state play an important role in the thermal photon production , it generates contribution of the same order of magnitude as compton scattering and @xmath2-annihilation processes based on the resummation of hard thermal loops@xcite . so that the investigation of the bremsstrahlung processes will be a subject of intense theoretical interest .",
    "the investigation in ref.@xcite focus on the bresstralung processes with one photon radiation induced by the parton - parton interaction inside qgp . in this paper",
    "we consider an external charged particle prepared at remote past goes through the plasma in thermal qed , which produces bresstralung radiation with @xmath3 photon radiation by colliding with charged constituent inside the plasma .",
    "such study will be of help to calculate the energy loss of fermion when it goes through the plasma@xcite .    in the semi - classical approximation ( classical charged current coupled with a quantized electromagnetic field )",
    "weldon investigated the bremsstrahlung processes in qed and emphasized on the cancellation of the infrared divergence@xcite . in this paper , however , we use fully finite temperature quantum field theoretical method to analyze above bremsstrahlung processes by calculating feynman diagrams .",
    "we will show that the same cancellation of the infrared divergence as in ref .",
    "@xcite occurs in the quantum field theoretical calculation .",
    "an interesting result is that quantum calculation results coincide completely with the result obtained in the semi - classical approximation for the radiation probability .",
    "we will argue the reason why the quantum effects of the bremstrahlung can be ignored by analyzing the connection between the electromagnetic field in the bremsstrahlung process and coherent state at finite temperature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we derive the radiation probability of the bremsstrahlung process by calculating the feynman diagram in the finite temperature field theory and investigate the cancellation of the infrared divergence . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we demonstrate that at finite temperature the radiation of soft photons in the bremsstrahlung processes is a coherent state in the framework of thermofield dynamics .",
    "a short summary is given in sec .",
    "consider an electron that passes through a plasma in equilibrium state with temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the electron accelerates by colliding with the charged constituent inside the plasma and produces the bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "now we consider the outgoing electron line in which the electron radiates @xmath5 photons with momentum @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "denote the initial four - momentum of the electron as @xmath7 and the final four - momentum as @xmath8.for the moment we do nt care whether these are external real photons or virtual photons which connect to each other or the vertices on the incoming electron line . in the calculation we should sum over all possible feynman diagrams which correspond to @xmath9 permutations for the ordering of the momenta @xmath6 as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "if we denote such permutation as @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the number among @xmath12 and @xmath5 , then the dirac structure ( the part related to @xmath13 matrices in the invariant scattering amplitude ) of the feynman diagrams is @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes all possible permutation @xmath16 . in the following we consider only soft photons radiation .",

    "2 is deduced as @xmath22    in general case , for @xmath5 soft photons emission if we do nt distinguish which one comes from the outgoing or incoming electron line , the dirac structure corresponding to the sum over all possible feynman diagrams can be expressed as @xmath23    when calculating the radiation probability of the real photon emission in the thermal equilibrium environment of the plasma , the boson enhancement factor @xmath24 should be taken into account in the phase space integration .",
