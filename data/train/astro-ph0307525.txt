    "it is currently widely believed that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) derive from narrow ( half - opening angle @xmath0 few degrees ) jets of relativistic ejecta pointing toward the observer .",
    "one of the basic motivations for this has been to relieve the energy crisis in grbs by reducing the necessary total energy from the inferred isotropic equivalent energy ( up to several @xmath1 ergs ) by a factor @xmath2 ( and thus boosting the total event rate by the reciprocal , @xmath3 , to include unseen jets directed away from the observer ) . if the grb emission is collimated , it is plausible that the afterglow shock is also collimated into a cone with opening angle @xmath4 , generally thought to be larger than @xmath5 .",
    "a rich area of inquiry is then to predict and look for observable consequences of a narrow jet both in the grb phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the afterglow phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most fundamental consequences derive from the deceleration of the afterglow as it propagates into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the relativistic motion of the emitting shock causes the radiation to be beamed into an angle @xmath6 in the observer frame . at early times , this relativistic beaming angle is smaller than the physical jet opening angle , @xmath7 , thus the emission appears to be isotropic . eventually , as the jet decelerates , it transitions to @xmath8 and the finite , non - isotropic extent of the jet becomes apparent to both the observer and to the jet itself .",
    "the observer sees a deficit of flux compared to that expected from an isotropic emitter .",
    "the jet , now being entirely causally connected , begins to expand sideways .",
    "these two effects combine to cause a break in the lightcurve @xcite .",
    "roughly twenty such jet - breaks have been observed ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and",
    "these constitute the most direct evidence for beaming to date .    also ,",
    "since the later , slower emission is beamed into a wider angle than the earlier emission , we expect to see off - axis optical and radio afterglows where no gamma - ray or x - ray burst was seen @xcite .",
    "to date these so - called `` orphan afterglows '' have yet to be positively observed .    thus far",
    "the study of this afterglow jet - break has assumed an afterglow pointed directly at the observer with constant , homogeneous , unstructured energy and mass density @xmath9 across the jet surface , with a hard edge at @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the heaviside step function . as such , from scaling laws , @xmath12 , the observation of a jet - break time , @xmath13 , gives direct information about the opening angle of the jet . while this model is relatively simple to calculate and",
    "is amenable to analytical calculation , it is not necessarily the easiest jet morphology for nature to produce and thus may not accurately represent a physical jet .",
    "firstly , one certainly expects the observers viewing angle , @xmath14 , of the jet to vary .",
    "furthermore , a homogeneous jet with a hard edge will be unstable to expansion and rarefaction and is thus unlikely to propagate intact and is unlikely to have been formed in the first place .",
    "recent numerical simulations by @xcite of relativistic jets emerging from stars , within the context of the ` collapsar ' model , show substantial structure , with the most energetic material along the jet axis and decreasing with larger angles from the axis .",
    "the first semi - analytical calculations of an afterglow jet with structure , i.e.  with decreasing energy density and/or lorentz factor as a function of angle for the jet axis , was done by @xcite while and analytical treatment was done by @xcite . not long before , a qualititative discussion of a structured jet model was put forward by @xcite .",
    "it was found by @xcite and @xcite that a universal structured jet , viewed at different angles , will yield a range of afterglows with jet - break times relating to viewing angle @xmath15 . by letting the energy per solid angle of the jet decrease with angle from the jet axis , @xmath16 , as @xmath17",
    ", they were able to effectively reproduce the observed relation @xmath18 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i present calculations that further refine the work by @xcite and @xcite . by discretizing the surface of the afterglow ,",
    "arbitrary functions of energy density , lorentz factor and lateral lorentz factor ( defined in the fluid frame ) can be simulated and lightcurves produced for arbitrary viewing angles @xmath16 .",
    "in so doing , i corroborate some of the key results of @xcite , i.e.  @xmath19 and @xmath20 if @xmath17 . also , these more detailed calculations allow for a quantitative discussion of how the lightcurve breaks ; in particular i find that a flattening , and even a bump in the lighcurve is possible just prior to the jet - break time .",
    "in addition i study lateral expansion and find that some of the general scaling laws that are widely used in afterglow work are incorrect .",
    "the calculation presented here begins by discretizing the surface of the afterglow mapped with polar coordinates , @xmath21 , into small elements of solid angle @xmath22 where herein we assume the afterglow is spherical , i.e.  zero inclination @xmath23 , and where @xmath24 corresponds to the jet axis .",
    "each surface element plows into the ism , sweeping up mass according to its cross - section @xmath25 , decelerating , shocking and radiating .",
    "the physics of this calculation can be broken up into two parts _ i ) _ the dynamical evolution of each surface element of the afterglow , as dictated by conservation of energy and momentum and _ ii ) _ the radiative mechanism , which i take to be the standard synchrotron shock model @xcite .    to calculate the evolution of the afterglow shock one needs only to invoke conservation of energy and momentum along with an assumption of radiation losses .",
    "herein i assume radiative losses are dynamically insignificant i.e.  the evolution is adiabatic .",

    "thus it was assumed that these equations are incorrect for describing afterglow shock dynamics for the entire evolution .",
    "there have been alternative formulations of the afterglow shock dynamics . the reason eqns .",
    "( [ e : enmomeqns ] ) do not reproduce the s - t solution is because the s - t solution ( and the blandford - mckee ( b - m ) solution @xcite ) is a `` blastwave '' and as such the fireball does work as it expands and thus radial momentum is not conserved .",
    "the s - t solution depends on the assumption of spherical symmetry ( the lateral expansion of a fluid element is opposed by expansion of adjacent elements , thus forcing the fluid radially ) and thus does not apply to a jet .",
    "the jet , having nothing to push on , expands laterally and , thus lacking a radial force , must conserve radial momentum .",
    "an afterglow jet is more akin to a bullet fired from a gun than to a spherically expanding blastwave ; the jet and the bullet are isolated , momentum conserving bodies decelerating due to their interaction with their surroundings , while the blastwave continues to do work as it expands , by virtue of its sphericity , and thus is not momentum conserving . thus i argue that eqns .",

    "this simplification is necessary to remove unwanted spectral breaks when attempting to study the cause and quality of dynamical jet breaks .",

    "i have tested both choices ( the former can be implemented by effectively replacing @xmath147 in eqn .",
    "( [ e : fnu ] ) ) and find a quantitative difference in the flux surface , but the difference is minimal for the integrated flux ; so the shape of the lightcurves is not significantly affected by this choice , as can be seen from the results presented in this section .",
    "the last difference is the choice of spectral index ; herein the value @xmath148 is employed while @xcite use @xmath149 . adopting the values used by @xcite , i find very good agreement with their results .",
    "thus far the discussion has concerned jets with no lateral ( sideways ) expansion , @xmath150 .",
    "it has been argued that when @xmath151 , i.e.  when the lorentz factor has decreased such that @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the sound speed , the shock will begin expanding sideways @xcite .",
    "this increasing angular size of the shock , sweeping up an ever larger region of ism , is supposed to impede the forward propagation and the shock begins to decelerate exponentially with radius .",
    "it is argued that this shift from forward expansion to lateral expansion will cause an exponential decay in lorentz factor as a function of radius , @xmath154 and thus a break in the afterglow lightcurve .",
    "thus one can derive the predicted post - break lightcurve slope by assuming forward expansion essentially ceases , @xmath155 constant .",
    "also , if the jet is narrow , then the jet opening angle will expand like @xmath156 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and since this physical extent of the jet is growing , one has @xmath157 ( eqn .",
    "[ e : thetaadef ] ) .",
    "thus from eqn .",
    "( [ e : fnuscale ] ) the flux goes like @xmath158 where @xmath159 for @xmath160 .",
    "also the observer time varies like @xmath161 ( eqn .",
    "[ e : tobsscale ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath162 for @xmath71 .",
    "however , the assumption that the radial expansion in @xmath46 effectively halts as a result of the lateral expansion of @xmath4 is an extreme limit characterized by a narrow opening angle , @xmath163 , and a lateral expansion velocity , assumed constant , that eventually exceeds the decelerating forward velocity .",
    "several workers @xcite have shown that in practice the lateral expansion of the jet does not reproduce the scaling discussed above and can not create a prominent , `` sharp '' break and instead tends to smooth and broaden the jet - break of eqn .",
    "( [ e : tjet ] ) .",
    "certainly the approximation of a narrow opening angle does not hold in general and we presently consider the behavior of @xmath45 .",
    "the lateral expansion is a result of internal pressure in the shocked medium which , in turn , is the result of the forward motion of the shock into the ism .",
    "thus i argue that a physically motivated model for lateral expansion is to make the rate of lateral expansion a function of the rate of forward expansion .",
    "thus , one does not expect the lateral expansion velocity to exceed the forward motion of the shock , from which it derives its energy .",
    "there are two basic reasons for this .",
    "first , as the shock progresses into the ism , in decelerates , thus the rate of injection of internal energy into the shock from bulk kinetic energy is monotonically decreasing ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "furthermore the shock is sweeping up interstellar mass at an increasing rate ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "as was pointed out by @xcite , this mass has no inherent lateral velocity component and thus new mass must be constantly accelerated .",
    "this is a significant source of `` drag '' on the decreasing internal pressure responsible for the expansion .",
    "thus the assumption that lateral expansion is at all times constant is unphysical .    in this section calculations",
    "are presented for afterglows with a simple lateral expansion model and it is found that lateral expansion serves primarily to smooth the break if it has any effect at all and , perhaps more importantly , provides very little if any steepening of the post - break light curve .",
    "each shock element originally moves radially with a lorentz factor @xmath166 .",
    "the relativistic jump conditions imply the shocked gas is heated by @xmath167 and is thus driven to expand laterally via its internal pressure .",
    "the actual lateral expansion that results is a complex balance between internal pressure forces of the shocked gas and the `` drag '' of constantly sweeping up and laterally accelerating fresh ism .",
    "this balance depends intimately on the hydromagnetic nature of collisionless shocks and is not well understood as of yet . here",
    "i simply perscribe that the lateral kinetic energy of the shock , in its radially comoving frame , is a constant proportion of the radial kinetic energy .",
    "thus i define this ratio @xmath168 which is a parameter measuring the shocks efficiency at converting radial kinetic energy , @xmath169 , into lateral kinetic energy , @xmath170 , and thus can vary from zero to unity .",
    "let us define lateral velocity as the velocity of the shock in the radially co - moving frame .",

    "this is because , as discussed in section [ sec_sideways_expansion ] , a realistic afterglow jet will expand laterally only in proportion to its forward expansion , thus the lateral expansion rate decreases at late time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : th0ngamma ] ) and the post - break decay curve will asymptotically move toward the limit of no lateral expansion ; @xmath215 .    to summarize ,",
    "i have implemented a simple model for jet dynamics in which the lateral expansion of the jet is an effect of forward expansion .",
    "i argue that this basic cause / effect relationship is a necessary component of any model for jet dynamics .",
    "resulting jet simulations show that lateral expansion _",
    "i ) _ smooths the break in the jet lightcurve , _ ii ) _ steepens the pre - break light curve , but does _ not _ significantly steepen the post - break slope of the light - curve , _ iii ) _ can significantly alter the shape of a lightcurve .",
    "thus i suggest that the oft - cited scaling laws described at the beginning of this section do not accurately represent the evolution of a laterally expanding jet . to properly diagnose lightcurve slopes and breaks , simulations such as those shown here are necessary .",
    "a preliminary conclusion that can be drawn from the simulations shown in this section is that large efficiencies in conversion of forward kinetic energy to lateral kinetic energy , i.e.  @xmath222 , are probably not physical , in the context of the homogeneous jet model , because the lightcurves they produce bear little resemlance to observed lightcurves .",
    "in this way one can begin to constrain the physics of afterglow shocks with observations .",
    "the primary purpose of the numerical framework discussed thus far is to quantitatively study the afterglow lightcurves from structured jets , i.e.  with a non - uniform energy or velocity distribution . as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , an asymptotic decrease in energy per solid angle like @xmath223 can reproduce the observed relation @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , allowing @xmath224 constant for angles within a core , @xmath225 provides a natural explanation for the dearth of small angle jets , less than @xmath226 also reported by @xcite .",
    "as such i define an ansatz energy profile @xmath227    how does one choose an initial @xmath228 ? based on simulations by @xcite , @xmath229 const .  and",
    "so this choice will be used for the structured jet runs in this paper .",
    "however , it is important to realize , and the following simulations confirm this , that initial @xmath44 only determines the deceleration time of the shock , but subsequent evolution is independent of it . to see this , noting the global energy has dependence @xmath230 from eqns .",
    "( [ e : enmomeqns ] ) , then for any radius greater than the deceleration radius , @xmath231 , the lorentz factor is determined by @xmath232 , independentof initial @xmath44 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gp1th30plot ] is shown a series of lightcurves from a universal structured jet with isotropic equivalent energy @xmath233 ergs@xmath234 , initial lorentz factor @xmath235 , core angle @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "these parameters generally reflect those inferred from burst observations by @xcite .",
    "this figure demonstrates the characteristics of a lightcurve derived from the structured jet described by @xcite .    using the scaling of eqns .",
    "( [ e : fnuscale ] , [ e : tobsscale ] ) with @xmath238 one finds @xmath239 and @xmath240 where the asymptotic limit of @xmath92 is given in table [ t : simplejet1 ] and @xmath241 for @xmath242 .",
    "using eqn .",
    "( [ e : structtscale ] ) and @xmath243 for a structured jet , at an early time ( @xmath244 ) the lorentz factor scales with observed angle as @xmath245 and so @xmath246 so the flux at a given time depends on viewing angle like @xmath247 for @xmath71 , and @xmath248 .",
    "there can be seen a gradual flattening , and eventual appearance of a bump , in the lightcurves of fig .",
    "[ fig : gp1th30plot ] with increasing viewing angle @xmath14 .",
    "this can be understood when one considers that the early phase of the lightcurve , i.e.  @xmath249 , is dominated by emission primarily along the line of sight ( los ) with energy @xmath250 , while the flux at the break is dominated by the energetic core moving at angle @xmath14 with respect to the observer . here",
    "i show that these two components have distinct laws for their breaks , and this difference between these two laws makes each component distinct for large viewing angles , @xmath14 , thus creating a bump .",
    "the line of sight component can be modeled as a homogeneous jet with opening angle @xmath14 . as such one expects a break when @xmath251 , so @xmath252 .",
    "furthermore @xmath253 .",
    "so @xmath254 where @xmath106 and @xmath255 .",
    "the jet core component can be modeled as a narrow jet seen far off - axis ; @xmath256 where @xmath257 .",
    "one expects a maximum flux when @xmath258 , thus @xmath259 , where @xmath260 for the core .",
    "it follows that @xmath261 .",
    "thus the core is brightest at @xmath262 for @xmath106 and @xmath255 .",
    "this relation traces the jet break in the lightcurve , @xmath263 , over a range of viewing angles .",
    "the different decay laws for eqns .",
    "( [ e : flos ] , [ e : fcore ] ) demonstrate why both components of a lightcurve from a structured jet will diverge for large break times",
    ". seen another way : @xmath264 thus the contribution to the lightcurve from the core happens progressively later than that of the line - of - sight material .",
    "as discussed above , under certain conditions a `` bump '' can appear in the lightcurve at the jet - break time .",
    "this typically happens at large viewing angles and small jet cores .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : bump ] shows three lightcurves from identical afterglows except for variation in the size of the jet core , @xmath265 , demonstrating that a narrower core produces a more prominent bump .",
    "this bump can be explained by considering how the flux varies as the observer sees an ever - increasing ( @xmath266 ) angular region of a surface with varying energy density .",
    "it can be shown that the observed flux varies like @xmath267 where @xmath268 for @xmath269 ( isotropic ) and @xmath270 otherwise ( jet - like ) .",
    "also , the energy per steradian of the afterglow goes like @xmath271 where in this case @xmath255 . thus the flux will vary like @xmath272 so that early in the evolution , when @xmath273 , the flux is down by @xmath274 as expected , but when the beaming angle has expanded to reach the core , i.e.  @xmath275 , the flux averaged over the surface will be @xmath276 . the flux of eqn .",
    "( [ e : bumpflux ] ) decreases as @xmath166 decreases until @xmath277 .",
    "so the smaller @xmath278 is , the farther out the bump will occur .",
    "the condition for _ no _ bump to be observed is when the jet core becomes visible , i.e.  @xmath279 , the flux has not yet begun to increase , thus @xmath280 so for @xmath268 and @xmath255 we have @xmath281 and so a bump will be visible if the jet is viewed at angles , @xmath16 , much in excess of @xmath282 . this analysis is born out in the simulations and gives constraints on the range of allowed viewing angles , @xmath16 , with respect to the size of jet core , @xmath265 , and the steepness of the jet decay structure , @xmath283 .",
    "there are several examples of bumps in light- curves including grb 970228 , grb 970508 , grb 980326 ( for a discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "while in general gamma - ray burst afterglows do not exhibit bumps in their lightcurves just prior to the break , grb 000301c exhibited a prominent , achromatic bump at the jet - break time which has been interpreted as a gravitational lensing event @xcite and alternatively as continuous energy injection by a millisecond pulsar @xcite . in light of the present calculations , it is possible that the bump in the lightcurve of grb 000301c was due to a simple perspective effect onto a jet with a narrow core or a steep decay curve .",
    "this explanation is appealing in that it does not require external mediators ( i.e. a lensing body or a pulsar ) to create it .",
    "if the bump in grb 000301c and possibly those of other burst lightcurves could be positively attributed to perspective onto a structured afterglow , key information could be determined about the size ( i.e.  the jet core @xmath265 ) and shape ( the decay structure @xmath283 ) of the afterglow .",
    "having constructed a structured jet model , we are interested in the effects of lateral expansion on said model .",
    "since the evolution of the afterglow shock is uncertain , i choose to study two basic paradigms .",
    "first , in this section i simply apply uniform expansion to the afterglow as was done for the homogeneous jet in the previous section .",
    "thus expansion is governed by eqn .",
    "( [ e : rkeqn ] ) .",
    "the second model , discussed in the next section , employs nonuniform expansion , where the hotter core expands faster than the cooler wings of the afterglow .",
    "examination of the progression of increasing lateral expansions figs .",
    "[ fig : gp1th30plot ] , [ fig : gp3.7th30plot ] & [ fig : gp10th30plot ] shows that lateral expansion suppresses the bump at the jet break time viewed at large @xmath14 .",
    "however , this also makes the breaks at small @xmath14 less pronounced .",
    "this behavior , where the jet break is more pronounced at high viewing angles , @xmath14 , than at small ones , is quite general .",
    "even a nonuniform expansion paradigm discussed in the next section demonstrates this .",
    "uniform expansion of the structured jet is likely oversimplified .",
    "a more accurate sideways expansion perscription should encapsulate one s hydrodynamic intuition that a fluid element will be accelerated proportionally to the gradient of its internal energy density . a simple model with this characteristic is @xmath284 using eqn .  ( [ energy_profile ] ) and where @xmath265 is not constant , but allowed to laterally expand with the jet by staying assigned to a particular fluid element .",
    "notice that eqn .",
    "( [ e : bernoulli ] ) replicates the uniform expansion of eqn .",
    "( [ e : rkeqn ] ) for small angles , @xmath285 , but transitions to a constant , rigid - body , expansion for large angles . figs .",
    "[ fig : gp1.6th30epsplot ] & [ fig : gp3.7th30epsplot ] demonstrate that non - uniform expansion can be very effective at creating a very sharp break in the lightcurve .    a key approximation of eqn .",
    "( [ e : bernoulli ] ) is that it assumes a fixed functional form for @xmath175 even as the shock surface evolves .",
    "this represents a model in which the proper hydrodynamic timescale , which increases with time , become longer than the deceleration timescale , thus the early time expansion morphology is `` frozen in '' and predominantly determines the subsequent evolution .",
    "further work is required to determine the hydrodynamical evolution of the afterglow .",
    "i have implemented a simple model for afterglow jet spreading in which lateral expansion depends upon energy from forward expansion .",
    "this model demonstrates that a homogeneous jet does not exhibit a lateral expansion dominated phase , as described by analytical arguments @xcite .",
    "in particular , dynamically @xmath286 , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : th0ngamma ] ) and observationally @xmath287 after the break , ( figs .",
    "[ fig : plplot1.6 ] , [ fig : plplot3.7 ] , [ fig : plplot10 ] ) . the only source of a break in this model is the observation of the physical edge of the jet . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : plplot1.6 ] , [ fig : plplot3.7 ] , [ fig : plplot10 ] , this break is ` sharpened ' by lateral expansion in that it becomes less dependent on viewing angle .    also , i have studied structured jets as seen at various viewing angles and with various sideways expansions .",
    "this study confirms the key results of @xcite , @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "furthermore , the jet break is seen to be sharp and can exhitibit some flattening and even a bump prior to the break at large viewing angles compared to the core size , @xmath290 .",
    "it appears to be a general feature of the universal jet model that late time jet breaks ( i.e.  large @xmath14 ) are more pronounced than early time breaks .",
    "that is , if early time breaks are sharp , then late time breaks will tend to have a flattening or a bump ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : gp3.7th30plot ] ) , but if this bump is quenched , perhaps by nonuniform spreading of the jet , the early - time breaks become weak or are washed out altogether ( e.g.  fig .  [ fig : gp3.7th30epsplot ] ) . in general , the sharpness of the structured jet break is determined by the size of the core , @xmath291 , and is thus intrinsically sharper than the break in the homogeneous jet model which depends upon the outside edge @xmath292 .",
    "as such the structured jet can explain sharper breaks than the homogeneous jet model .",
    "future work with e.  rossi et al .  will focus on polarization ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : polplot ] ) as a tool to discriminate between the homogeneous and structured jet paradigms .",
    "also , improved understanding of the evolution of the jet , whether it be hydrodynamic or otherwise , will allow for more quantitative expansion models and more predictive simulations .",
