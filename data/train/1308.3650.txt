    "since its launch in february 2010 , the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; @xcite ) has been producing high - resolution , full - disk images of the sun in ten wavelength bands with a 12 second cadence .",
    "this instrument has a similar spatial resolution to that of former solar imager , the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ; @xcite ) , but has an increased field of view , temporal resolution and spectral coverage .",
    "seven of the ten passbands are tuned to observe emission in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ; 94 , 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 304 , and 335 ) and each of these passbands contain emission lines formed at distinctly different temperatures , as well as potential continuum emission .",
    "knowledge of which emission processes dominate the images under different conditions are crucial for interpreting the data correctly .",
    "analysis of the emission contributing to the 171  and 195  channels on trace during flares was previously carried out by @xcite using the chianti atomic database ( version 5 ; @xcite ) . typically , these channels are dominated by emission at quiescent coronal temperatures ( 12  mk ) . during flares",
    ", however , the 195  channel becomes sensitive to emission from the line at 192.03  which is formed at @xmath015  mk . above these temperatures",
    "continuum emission was found to dominate the 171  channel . in the 195  channel",
    "the maximum contribution from continuum emission was estimated to be about 10% at a temperature of 4  mk .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also showed that the continuum contribution to the 171  channel introduced further ambiguities when determining flare temperatures using filter ratio techniques .",
    "theoretical analysis of the composition of the sdo / aia images has been conducted by @xcite .",
    "the authors examined the contribution of both line and continuum ( free - free ) emission to each of the euv channels for quiet sun , coronal hole , active region and flare plasmas by convolving synthetic spectra , obtained using the chianti atomic database ( version 6.0.1 ; @xcite ) under an assumed differential emission measure ( dem ) , with the response function for each aia channel @xcite . in the case of flaring plasma ,",
    "the dem of @xcite from the decay phase of an m2 flare was used .",
    "coronal abundances from @xcite , ionization equilibrium , and an electron density of 10@xmath1  @xmath2 were also assumed . under these conditions the authors found that the continuum contribution to each channel was negligible ( @xmath36% ) , except in the case of the 171  and 211  channels were it was found be as high as 23% and 41% , respectively .",
    "more recently , however , @xcite used spectral data from the euv variability experiment ( eve ; @xcite ) , also on sdo , to show that continuum emission , both free - free ( due to thermal bremsstrahlung ) and free - bound ( due to recombination ) , became significantly enhanced during an x - class solar flare .",
    "it was shown that the lightcurves of the free - free emission rose in concert with that of the goes 18  lightcurve suggesting that the emission is predominantly coronal in nature , while the free - bound emission from ( lyman continuum ) and peaked around the time of hxr emission as observed by the ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ; @xcite ) indicating a chromospheric origin .",
    "while emission from the continuum was also believed to be chromospheric , it was found to be inherently weaker than the lyman and continua , and its lightcurve was found to peak much later in the flare due to the dominance of the underlying free - free emission during the flare s early stages .    as the eve megs - a ( multiple euv grating spectrographs ) wavelength range ( 60370   )",
    "contains each of aia s euv passbands ( vertical dot - dashed red lines in figure  [ eve_spec ] ) it is now possible to quantify the continuum contributions to each channel during solar flares by convolving the observed eve spectra , rather than a synthetic one , with the aia response functions .",
    "this not only removes any assumptions about the physical conditions of the emitting plasma , but also allows the relative continuum contribution to be determined as a function of time throughout a flaring event , rather than just during the decay phase as necessitated by the use of the flare dem of @xcite by @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a detailed analysis of the continuum contributions to each of the euv channels on aia during the x - class flare that occurred on 2011 february 15 , as well as extending the analysis to a range of other large flares .",
    "section  [ data_anal ] describes the flare observations from eve and the aia response functions .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ results ] , and summarized in section  [ conc ] where their implications are also discussed .",
    "the eve instrument acquires full disk ( sun - as - a - star ) euv spectra every 10 seconds over the 65370    wavelength range using its megs - a component with a near 100% duty cycle . in march 2013 ,",
    "version 3 of the level 2 data ( used in this work ) were released .",
    "@xcite noted that irradiance values around 100  in version 3 are @xmath050% lower than those in version 2 , which were used by @xcite .        on 2011 february 15 the first x - class flare of solar cycle 24 occurred ; an x2.2 flare that began at 01:44  ut ( sol2011 - 02 - 15t01:56 ) .",
    "figure  [ eve_spec ] shows an eve megs - a spectra ( pre - flare subtracted ) taken near the sxr peak of the flare ( 01:55:32 ut ) .",
    "the pre - flare irradiance was calculated by averaging over 90  s prior to the flare onset ( from 01:00:1201:01:42  ut ) and was subtracted from the total irradiance to isolate the flux produced by the flare itself .",
    "this figure shows that the underlying free - free emission ( represented by the solid blue curve ) spans the entire megs - a spectral range , and that the enhancement due to the flare is greater at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the recombination continuum of ( purple curve blueward of the recombination edge at 228 ; vertical dashed purple line ) is also visible and appears to straddle the 211  passband .",
    "measurements of the continuum emission during this flare were previously deduced by @xcite by fitting the line - free portions of the eve megs - a spectrum ( deduced from a synthetic flare spectrum from chianti ) with an exponential function .",
    "however , given that the eve wavelength range is likely to contain emission lines which are not present in the chianti database ( _ c.f . _",
    "@xcite ) it is possible that a number of weak lines may have biased the previous fits to the continuum .",
    "furthermore , this technique was found to produce inconsistant continuum time profiles for other events . and",
    "so rather than assuming that a limited number of spectral ranges were free from any emission lines , it was assumed that the free - free emission corresponded to the lower envelope of the eve spectra .",
    "therefore the local minima ( @xmath4 ) across the megs - a spectral range were identified by taking the first and second derivatives of the eve spectra ( @xmath5 ; bottom two panels of figure  [ deriv_spec ] ) with respect to wavelength , such that : @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the index of the wavelength bin at which the first two conditions were met .",
    "these local minima ( vertical dashed red lines in figure  [ deriv_spec ] ) were then fit with an exponential function ( solid blue curve ) similar to that of @xcite .",
    "however , three wavelength ranges ( light shaded areas in figure  [ deriv_spec ] ) were omitted from the fitting process in order to prevent possible biases : 60@xmath980  was omitted due to scatter in the background - subtracted data at these wavelengths ; 100@xmath9125  was omitted to avoid the pseudo - continuum generated by the close proximity of  lines ; and 160@xmath9230  was omitted to avoid any negative flux values around 171  due to possible coronal dimming @xcite , and free - bound emission blueward of the edge at 228 .",
    "having fit the free - free continuum , this was then subtracted from the data to allow the fitting of the free - bound continuum of ( assumed to extend from 200 - 228 ) using a similar process .",
    "the 200210  range ( dark shaded region in figure  [ deriv_spec ] ) was omitted from the fitting process due to an elevated pseudo - continuum , while the local minima between 210 - 228  ( vertical dashed green lines in figure  [ deriv_spec ] ) were fit with an exponential function .",
    "however , these fits were only carried out up until the end time of the flare as stipulated in the goes event list , beyond which the data became too noisy to reliably measure any recombination emission .",
    "both the pre - flare subtracted eve data and the fits to the underlying continua were convolved with the aia response functions at each 10  s interval throughout the course of the flare to yield a measurement of the contributions to each channel .",
    "the continuum was subtracted from the total irradiance in each channel to establish the relative contributions from both line and continuum emission .",
    "the effective areas for each of the seven euv channels on aia were retrieved using the aia_get_response function available in _ solarsoftware idl _ @xcite .",
    "the evenorm keyword was applied to normalize the wavelength response functions to give a better agreement with full - disk eve observations .",
    "each channel has a fairly symmetric gaussian response function centered on its primary wavelength ( red curves in figure  [ eve_convol ] )",
    ".        however , the response function for the 335  channel also shows a considerable contribution at shorter wavelengths .",
    "@xcite predicted a second - order peak around 184   due to mirror reflectivity , which is shown in figure  [ eve_convol]g .",
    "the existence of crosstalk at 131  in this channel was also predicted .",
    "each telescope on the aia instrument carries two channels which are grouped to minimise crosstalk . however , the effects are non - negligible for the wavelength response function of the 335  channel which shares telescope 1 with the 131  channel .",
    "focal - plane filters select the required channel for data acquisition , but the 335  focal - plane filter also receives some light from the highly - reflective 131  channel .",
    "more recently , a significant `` red leak '' was discovered in the 335  channel during updated calibration measurements of the reflectivity of the aia mirror coatings ( paul boerner ; priv . comm .",
    "see also @xcite ) .",
    "this leak is seen as a bump in the 335  response function between 500800 , which is covered by the eve megs - b channel , as shown in figure  [ red_leak ] .",
    "this feature appears to lie between the and h lyman recombination continua .",
    "neither of these continua is therefore expected to contribute significantly to the 335  channel during flares , as the response function at these wavelengths is also a factor of 6 weaker than those in the megs - a channel .",
    "however , the lyman continuum may indeed contribute to the 335  channel during quiescent sun conditions .",
    "figure  [ eve_convol ] shows the pre - flare subtracted spectra from eve ( black histogram ) around the central wavelength range of each of the seven aia channels at a time close to peak sxr emission of the 2011 february 15 flare .",
    "the black dotted lines show the eve spectra having been convolved with the aia effective areas and so gives the total predicted irradiance observed by each of the aia passbands .",
    "the solid blue line shows the fit to the free - free continuum obtained using the method described in section  [ data_anal ] , while the blue dashed line shows this fit convolved with the aia effective areas for each passband .",
    "the effective areas themselves are overplotted in red . in figure",
    "[ eve_convol]e , the fit to the continuum around the 211  channel is overplotted in purple . the convolution of this fit with the response function is shown as a dashed purple line .    at the peak of the flare",
    "the 94  channel showed a strong line at 93.93  due to above the underlying free - free emission ( figure  [ eve_convol]a ) , while the 131  channel appeared to be dominated by and at 128.75  and 132.91 , respectively ( figure  [ eve_convol]b ) .",
    "results for the 171  channel were somewhat ambiguous as the line at 171.07  that is believed to dominate this channel appeared to be very weak , or possibly even non - existent , as evidenced in figure  [ eve_convol]c .",
    "this is possibly due to coronal dimming at these temperatures as noted by @xcite in several events observed by eve , but could also be due to the fact that pre - existing material at temperatures will have been heated to higher ionization states at this stage of the flare .",
    "emission in the 193  channel ( figure  [ eve_convol]d ) appeared to be mostly due to emission at 192.03  at this stage of the flare , with a weak contribution from at 195.12 .",
    "the 211  channel ( figure  [ eve_convol]e ) comprises multiple lines formed over a range of temperatures : ( 209.78 ) , ( 209.62 ) , ( 211.32 ) , ( 204.67 ) , and ( 208.60 ) , all of which are considerably weak .",
    "this could also be due to coronal dimming at these temperatures , or heating of these elements to higher ionisation stages .",
    "strong contributions from both free - free and free - bound ( ) continuum emission are also present .",
    "the 304  channel is dominated by the self - blended line at 303.78  ( figure  [ eve_convol]f ) which is the strongest line in the eve spectrum .",
    "figure  [ eve_convol]g shows that the 335  channel comprises a strong contribution from at 335.41  as well as contamination from the and lines , as well as continuum emission , around 131  as discussed in section  [ data_anal ] .",
    "however there did not appear to be any significant contribution from the second - order peak at 184  as predicted .          using the method described in section  [ data_anal ] lightcurves of the total emission predicted for each aia channel",
    "were compiled for the duration of the flare ( solid black curves in upper panels in figure  [ ff_ratios ] ) between 01:4003:40  ut for each passband .",
    "lightcurves of the corresponding line ( red ) and continuum ( blue ) emission are also plotted . to draw more discernible comparisons , the relative fractions of each emission",
    "are shown in the lower panels of each plot .",
    "each curve is also overlaid with a 6-point ( 1  minute ) boxcar smoothed function from which the relative contribution at various stages during the flare were ascertained ( table  [ prct_cnt ] and vertical lines in figure  [ ff_ratios ] ) .",
    "the 94  channel might have been expected to have shown the strongest contribution of continuum emission given that free - free emission increases at shorter wavelengths . from the ratio plots in figure",
    "[ ff_ratios]a it can be seen that the continuum is particularly significant at the flare onset ( 1520% ) but gradually decreases to about 10% by the time the goes flux reaches 10% of its maximum before eventually returning to zero .",
    "the continuum also makes a significant contribution to the 131  channel . throughout the course of the flare it makes up about 2030% of the total emission before decreasing during the late decay phase ( figure  [ ff_ratios]b ) .",
    "the continuum in the 193  channel increases from 015% over the main phase of the flare before returning to zero ( figure  [ ff_ratios]c ) .",
    "free - free continuum emission was found to be comparable to line emission in the 211  channel , making up between 4050% of the total emission around the peak of the flare . in figure",
    "[ ff_ratios]d the ratios shown for this channel are quite noisy , perhaps due to the existence of several lines , each being more prevalent at different stages of the flare , as well as scatter due to the fits to the continuum .",
    "@xcite also predicted the 211  channel to have the greatest proportion of continuum emission , but their estimate of 41% was only applicable to the decay phase .",
    "the findings presented here suggest that only 25% of emission in the decay phase is due to free - free emission during this event .",
    "emission from the continuum on the other hand , not considered by @xcite , was found to peak around the time of peak hxr emission as expected by @xcite . at this time it made up @xmath020% of the total emission in the 211  channel after which it began to decrease .",
    "no reliable measurements of the continuum could be made after about 02:05  ut .    the 304  channel predominantly observes emission from at 303.78 .",
    "this is the strongest line in the eve spectrum , both at quiescent and flaring times .",
    "given that the continuum is inherently weaker at longer wavelengths , it is unsurprising that the continuum contribution to this channel is negligible ( @xmath31% ) in agreement with @xcite .",
    "similar to the 94  and 131  channels , the lightcurves for the 335  channel ( figure  [ ff_ratios]f ) show the greatest contribution from continuum emission at the flare onset ( @xmath020% ) , which decreases to zero as the flare progresses .",
    "the continuum contribution to the 335  channel is primarily due to the crosstalk from 131  as the line at 335.41  is very strong compared to the continuum at these wavelengths .",

    "reliable fits to the free - free continuum were achieved in 24 events for all channels except the 171 . in this case the continuum level could only be measured in 18 flares .",
    "figure  [ goes_cont_frac ] shows how the free - free continuum contribution to each channel at the sxr peak of each event changes with respect to goes class for flares greater than m2 .",

    "the continuum contribution increases from 20% for m2 flares up to @xmath055% for the x6.9 flare of 2011 august 9 .",
    "in one outlying event ( an x1.9 flare that occurred on 2011 november 3 ) this increases to over 80% .",
    "the distribution for the 171  channel shows a similar slope but has a maximum contribution of 45% in the largest flares .",
    "detailed measurements of the amount of continuum emission ( both free - free and free - bound ) contributing to each of the euv passbands on sdo / aia throughout an x - class solar flare are presented .",
    "background - subtracted eve spectra , and the corresponding fits to the underlying continua , were convolved with the aia response functions to determine the relative amount of line and continuum emission in each channel as a function of time throughout the flare .",
    "the findings are in broad agreement with those of @xcite who performed a similar analysis using synthetic spectra from chianti .",
    "both studies show that the 211  channel exhibits the largest contribution of free - free continuum emission during flaring conditions .",
    "the results presented show that this continuum can contribute between 4050% to the total emission in the 211  channel at the soft x - ray peak of an x - class flare .",
    "it is also shown that the recombination continuum of also made up @xmath020% of the 211  channel emission .",
    "this free - bound emission was not considered in the work of @xcite . while continuum emission in the 304  channel was indeed negligible for the duration of the flare , and measurements for the 171  channel",
    "were uncertain due to potential coronal dimming at these wavelengths , typically between 1025% of emission observed in the remaining euv channels was found to be due to free - free bremsstrahlung for the 2011 february 15 flare .",
    "this analysis was repeated for a number of flares between m2 and x7 and the level of continuum emission in both the 171  and 211  channels at the peak of each event was found to scale with respect to its goes classification .",
    "this is due to the primary lines in each of these channels ( and , respectively ) becoming inherently weaker during flares , due to either coronal dimming or depletion of material at these temperatures as it gets heated to higher ionizations states , and therefore the relative intensity of the underlying continuum increases .",
    "eve observations also help remove , or at least constrain , some of the assumptions used in generating synthetic flare spectra .",
    "for example , @xcite identified three pairs of ratios within the eve spectral range which can be used to measure electron densities , particularly in large events .",
    "they found densities on the order of 10@xmath10  @xmath2 for x - class flares ; an order of magnitude larger than that assumed by @xcite in their study .",
    "similarly , @xcite have developed techniques to generate dem profiles throughout a flaring event also using eve data which would mark a significant advancement over the currently assumed flare dem from @xcite .",
    "several authors have also attempting to generate flare dems directly from aia data ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , but the resulting profiles may be inaccurate due to the underestimation or exclusion of the continuum emission in each of the filters .",
    "so while aia often saturates during even moderate flaring events ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the findings presented here underscore the need for coordinated spectral and imaging data to correctly interpret the observations .",
