    "the self - adjointness of operators of physical observables in quantum mechanics is required by general principles of comprehensibility and mathematical consistency , see , e.g. , @xcite . to put it simply , a multiple action is well defined for a self - adjoint operator only , allowing for the construction of functions of the operator , such as resolvent , evolution , heat kernel and zeta - function operators , with further implications upon second quantization .",
    "the mathematical demand for the self - adjointness of a basic operator acting on functions defined in a bounded spatial region is a somewhat more general than the physical demand for the confinement of quantized matter fields inside this region .",
    "the concept of confined matter fields is quite familiar in the context of condensed matter physics : collective excitations ( e.g. , spin waves and phonons ) exist only inside material objects and do not spread outside . in the context of quantum electrodynamics ,",
    "if one is interested in the effect of a classical background magnetic field on the vacuum of the quantized electron - positron matter , then the latter should be considered as confined to the spatial region between the sources of the magnetic field , as long as collective quasielectronic excitations inside a magnetized material differ from electronic excitations in the vacuum .",
    "it should be noted in this respect that the effect of the background electromagnetic field on the vacuum of quantized charged matter was studied for eight decades almost , see @xcite and a review in @xcite .",
    "however , the concern was for the case of a background field filling the whole ( infinite ) space , that is hard to be regarded as realistic .",
    "the case of both the background and quantized fields confined to a bounded spatial region with boundaries serving as sources of the background field looks much more physically plausible , it can even be regarded as realizable in laboratory .",
    "moreover , there is no way to detect the energy density that is induced in the vacuum in the first case , whereas the pressure from the vacuum onto the boundaries , resulting in the second case , is in principle detectable .    in view of the above ,",
    "an issue of a choice of boundary conditions ensuring the confinement of the quantized matter gains a crucial significance .",
    "it seems that a quest for such boundary conditions was initiated in the context of a model description of hadrons as composites of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "if an hadron is an extended object occupying spatial region @xmath0 bounded by surface @xmath1 , then the condition that the quark matter field be confined inside the hadron is formulated as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the unit normal to the boundary surface , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the quark matter field ( an appropriate condition is also formulated for the gluon matter field ) .",
    "condition ( 1 ) should be resolved to take the form of a boundary condition that is linear in @xmath6 , and an immediate way of such a resolution is known as the mit bag boundary condition @xcite , @xmath7\\psi(\\mathbf{r})|_{\\mathbf{r}\\in \\partial{\\omega}}=0 \\eqno(2)\\ ] ] ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the generating elements of the dirac - clifford algebra ) , but it is needless to say that this way is not a unique one .",
    "the most general boundary condition that is linear in @xmath6 in the case of a simply - connected boundary involves four arbitrary parameters @xcite , and the explicit form of this boundary condition has been given @xcite ; the condition is compatible with the self - adjointness of the dirac hamiltonian operator , and its four parameters can be interpreted as the self - adjoint extension parameters . in the present work , i follow the lines of works @xcite by proposing a different , embracing more cases , form of the four - parameter generalization of the mit bag boundary condition .",
    "thus , let us consider in general the quantized spinor matter field that is confined to the three - dimensional spatial region @xmath0 bounded by the two - dimensional surface @xmath1 . to study a response of the vacuum to the background magnetic field , we restrict ourselves to the case of the boundary consisting of two parallel planes ; the magnetic field is assumed to be uniform and orthogonal to the planes .",
    "such a spatial geometry is typical for the remarkable macroscopic quantum phenomenon which yields the attraction ( negative pressure ) between two neutral plates and which is known as the casimir effect @xcite , see review in @xcite .",
    "the conventional casimir effect is due to vacuum fluctuations of the quantized electromagnetic field obeying certain boundary conditions at the bounding plates , and a choice of boundary conditions is physically motivated by material properties of the plates ( for instance , metallic or dielectric , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a motivation is lacking for the case of vacuum fluctuations of the quantized spinor matter field .",
    "that is why there is a necessity in the last case to start from the most general set of mathematically acceptable ( i.e. compatible with the self - adjointness ) boundary conditions .",
    "further follow physical constraints that the spinor matter be confined within the plates and that the spectrum of the wave number vector in the direction which is orthogonal to the plates be unambiguously ( although implicitly ) determined . employing these mathematical and physical restrictions ,",
    "i consider the generalized casimir effect which is due to vacuum fluctuations of the quantized spinor matter field in the presence of the background magnetic field ; the pressure from the vacuum onto the bounding plates will be found .",
    "defining a scalar product as @xmath12 , we get , using integration by parts , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the formal expression for the dirac hamiltonian operator and @xmath15 is the covariant derivative involving both the affine and bundle connections ( natural units @xmath16 are used ) .",
    "operator @xmath17 is hermitian ( or symmetric in mathematical parlance ) , @xmath18 if @xmath19 the latter condition can be satisfied in various ways by imposing different boundary conditions for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "however , among the whole variety , there may exist a possibility that a boundary condition for @xmath21 is the same as that for @xmath20 ; then the domain of definition of @xmath22 ( set of functions @xmath21 ) coincides with that of @xmath17 ( set of functions @xmath20 ) , and operator @xmath17 is self - adjoint .",
    "the action of a self - adjoint operator results in functions belonging to its domain of definition only , and , therefore , a multiple action and functions of such an operator can be consistently defined .",
    "condition ( 6 ) is certainly fulfilled when the integrand in ( 6 ) vanishes , i.e. @xmath23 to fulfill the latter condition , we impose the same boundary condition for @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a matrix ( element of the dirac - clifford algebra ) which is determined by two conditions : @xmath26 and @xmath27 it should be noted that , in addition to ( 7 ) , the following combination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 is also vanishing at the boundary : @xmath28 using the standard representation for the dirac matrices , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the pauli matrices ) , one can get @xmath32 where condition @xmath33 defines @xmath34 as a rank-2 matrix depending on four arbitrary parameters @xcite .",

    "the `` number '' of self - adjoint extension parameters is in fact infinite , moreover , it is not countable but is of power of a continuum .",
    "this distinguishes the case of an extended boundary from the case of an excluded point ( contact interaction ) , when the number of self - adjoint extension parameters is finite , being equal to @xmath65 for the deficiency index equal to \\{@xmath66 } ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the context of the casimir effect ,",

    "we study an influence of a background ( classical ) magnetic field on the vacuum of a quantized charged spinor matter field which is confined to a bounded region of space ; the sources of the magnetic field are outside of the bounded region , and the magnetic field strength lines are assumed to be orthogonal to a boundary .",
    "the confinement of the matter field ( i.e. absence of the matter flux across the boundary ) is ensured by boundary condition ( 32 ) which is compatible with the self - adjointness of the dirac hamiltonan operator and which generalizes the well - known mit bag boundary condition to the most extent . in the case which is relevant to the geometry of the casimir effect ( i.e. the spatial region bounded by two parallel planes separated by distance @xmath191 ) and the uniform magnetic field orthogonal to the planes ,",
    "the most general extension of the mit bag boundary condition is given by ( 55 ) ; the spectrum of the wave number vector along the magnetic field in this case depends on the number of the landau level and on the sign of the one - particle energy , see ( 57 ) .",
    "the casimir pressure is shown to take the form of ( 71 ) , where @xmath269 is given by ( 45 ) and @xmath270 is given by ( 72)-(76 ) ; the result for the case of the mit bag boundary condition is obtained from ( 71 ) at @xmath208 , @xmath205 .",
    "the casimir effect is usually validated in experiments with nearly parallel plates separated by a distance of order @xmath271 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the pressure from the vacuum of neutral massless spinor matter onto the bounding plates is given by @xmath238 times a constant of proportionality , either positive or negative , depending on a choice of boundary conditions , see ( 105)-(107 ) .",
    "the situation with charged massive spinor matter is quite different .",
    "the compton wavelength of the lightest charged particle , electron , is @xmath272 , thus @xmath273 and , as has been shown in the preceding section , all the dependence of the casimir pressure on the distance between the plates and a choice of boundary conditions at the plates is suppressed by factor @xmath245 , see ( 92)-(94 ) and ( 100)-(102 ) .",
    "hence , the pressure from the electron - positron vacuum onto the plates separated by distance @xmath274 is well approximated by @xmath275 , where @xmath269 ( 45 ) is negative , i.e. the pressure is positive and the plates are repelled . some possibilities to detect this new - type casimir effect were pointed out in @xcite .",
