    "the edwards - anderson ising spin glass  @xcite ( eai ) is a paradigmatic model for disordered magnets .",
    "the physics of its fully connected counterpart , the sherrington - kirkpatrick model ( sk ) @xcite , is well understood  @xcite .",
    "the sk model has striking features at temperatures below the spin - glass transition temperature , like replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) , an ultrametric organization of the states , and a non - trivial functional order parameter .",
    "the situation is less clear for finite - dimensional spin glasses .",
    "two conflicting approaches to describe the nature of their spin - glass phase have gained polarized consensus in the last decades .",
    "on one side , the scaling picture ( or equivalently the droplet model  @xcite ) describes the equilibrium properties at low temperatures in terms of a single thermodynamic state ( actually , due to the global spin reversal symmetry , one pair of states ) . on the other side the rsb picture ,",
    "a mean - field - like description based on the solution of the sk model , predicts the existence of infinitely many pure states contributing to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we stress that the _ one or many _ states question is the crucial one  , is manifest in a finite volume . ] , whereas the ultrametric structure of phase space , after recent theoretical results  @xcite , is expected to hold in many finite - dimensional spin - glass models ( at least trivially ) , and has been confirmed by numerical experiments either directly  @xcite , or by inspection of the overlap equivalence property  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the `` one or many '' states question can be cast as well as a problem about self - averageness . according to the droplet picture , sample - to - sample fluctuations should fade away in that limit . on the other hand ,",
    "a most surprising feature of the mean - field solution is that these fluctuations survive the thermodynamic limit , and are substantial  @xcite : macroscopic observable quantities can take different values in different infinite - volume samples .",
    "it is important to note that this disagreement among the two theories concerns thermal equilibrium , and is thus mostly relevant to analytic and numerical computations .",
    "experimentally , the question could be addressed by studying spatial regions as small as the spin - glass coherence length ( that has been estimated to be of the order of @xmath0 lattice spacings close to the critical temperature @xmath1  @xcite , and smaller for lower and higher temperatures ) .",
    "this is a difficult approach that is only at its birth  @xcite .",
    "the lack of self - averageness , with an emphasis on quantities that have not been averaged over the quenched disorder  @xcite and especially on the effect of rare non - typical samples ( using either a numerical  @xcite or a theoretical  @xcite approach ) , has recently become a topic of interest .",
    "it seems the most promising approach to the study of temperature chaos  @xcite and the possibly related rejuvenation and memory effects  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is hardly surprising that recent proposals have tried to deal with the `` one or many '' states controversy by studying sample - to - sample fluctuations and their system - size dependency  @xcite . the original approach of ref .",
    "has the drawback of not being directly sensitive to the statistical weight of the states , and a further improvement to this analysis scheme that has been introduced recently  @xcite can be of help .    here",
    ", we further refine the approach of refs .  , and we compare its predictions to the different theoretical expectations . on the one side rsb predicts large sample - to - sample fluctuations ( the probability density function is barely normalizable ) , which call for special care in the data analysis . on the other hand , following ref .",
    ", we employ toy models in order to get droplet - model like predictions .",
    "both theoretical expectations are tested against the results of our numerical analysis both for the three - dimensional eaimodel  @xcite , and for the mean - field sk model .",
    "we find that the sk and eaimodels behave much in the same way ( including the finite - size and finite - statistics effects ) . the droplets picture is thus disfavored from our analysis , at least within the range of system sizes and temperatures that one can equilibrate using the special - purpose janus computer@xcite .",

    "the edwards - anderson model is defined by a nearest - neighbor hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath2 is a function of a set of quenched random coupling constants @xmath3 ( a specific realization of the random coupling constants is called a disorder sample ) and of a set of ising spin variables @xmath4 defined on the vertices of a ( hyper-)cubic lattice : @xmath5 where the summation extends over all pairs of nearest - neighboring sites .",
    "the couplings @xmath3 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables with zero mean and unit variance , usually standard normal or , as in our numerical experiments , binary ( @xmath6 ) distributed . in the sk model",
    ", every spin interacts with all other spins , and the variance of the @xmath3 distribution is inversely proportional to the total number of spins .",
    "it is an established fact , with both experimental  @xcite and numerical evidence  @xcite , that in three spatial dimensions the eaimodel undergoes a second - order phase transition at a finite transition temperature , from a paramagnetic high - temperature state to a low - temperature spin - glass state ( with no magnetic long - range order ) .",
    "the _ overlap _ between two independent equilibrium spin configurations in the same disorder sample ( two real replicas ) is the order parameter of the model : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total number of spins ( in the @xmath9 eai case @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the spatial dimension and @xmath12 is the linear size of the lattice ) .",
    "the overlap is a random variable whose probability density @xmath13 depends on the disorder realization .",
    "the overlap distribution is the average over all disorder realizations of @xmath13 : @xmath14 where we adopt the usual notation @xmath15 for thermal averages in a single disorder sample and @xmath16 for the average over different samples .",
    "the droplet and rsb pictures offer dramatically different qualitative predictions for the shape of @xmath17 in the thermodynamic limit . in the droplet scenario , for large system sizes ,",
    "a single delta function and its global - inversion symmetric image ( both smeared by finite - size effects ) dominate the overlap distribution ; the location of this delta function defines the _ edwards - anderson order parameter _ @xmath18 . at high temperature ,",
    "@xmath19 is null ; below the transition temperature the spins freeze in disordered ( sample - dependent ) orientations and the overlap distribution is a symmetric pair of ( smeared ) delta functions at @xmath20 . in the rsb scenario",
    "a continuous distribution is present between the two symmetric delta peaks at @xmath21 , due to the presence of infinitely many states in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since the predictions of the droplet and rsb pictures for the behavior of @xmath22 are so different , precise numerical measurements of the quantities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pq ] ) could in principle give a clear - cut distinction between the two pictures .",
    "numerical simulations are , however , always performed on finite systems and accordingly an extrapolation to the infinite - volume limit is needed .",
    "this extrapolation is , however , not straightforward , and the question of the large - volume limit of @xmath22 data has led to contrasting interpretations in the literature  @xcite .    in the droplet model , compact excitations of linear size @xmath23",
    "have probability @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a positive exponent , and consequently the probability of having small overlap values , dominated by very large - scale excitations , is vanishing in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 in three dimensions .",
    "this is a very small value , and since the simulations are performed on small systems ( we will present data for @xmath28 systems with values of @xmath12 going up to @xmath29 , but many equilibrium numerical simulations in the literature are limited to @xmath30 or even less ) it is a challenge to distinguish unambiguously between an @xmath26 and a constant limiting behavior of the data .",
    "this has led to a recent shift of attention toward the study of the whole distribution ( with respect to disorder ) of the non - averaged @xmath13 , in the quest for a measurable quantity with unmistakably different finite - volume behavior for the two pictures .",
    "this is part of a general recent interest on non - disorder - averaged quantities  @xcite and especially on the effect of rare non - typical samples  @xcite .",
    "in particular , ref .   analyzes the probability @xmath31 of finding in @xmath13 , for @xmath32 , a peak higher than some value @xmath33 . in the rsb picture",
    "this probability goes to one in the infinite - volume limit for all values @xmath34 .",
    "in the droplet picture , some peaks may exist in @xmath13 below @xmath19 , but their effect disappears as @xmath8 grows , and @xmath31 goes to zero in the @xmath35 limit .",
    "the results of ref .   seem to suggest that for the sk model this quantity does grow as @xmath8 grows , but reaches a plateau for the @xmath9 eaimodel .",
    "it was later shown @xcite , however , by using larger systems ( @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 ) , that @xmath31 does grow with @xmath8 for the @xmath9 eaimodel also . the slower growth that one has in the eaimodel as compared to the sk model",
    "can be explained by the simple assumption that the peaks for all values of @xmath38 grow at the same rate , taking into account the known scaling of the @xmath19 peak in both models .",
    "note that a drawback of the method of ref .",
    "is that @xmath31 is not directly sensitive to the peak weight , which is what matters here , but to its height .    in a recent paper",
    "@xcite it was noticed that for both the zero temperature @xmath39 eaimodel with binary distributed couplings , and for a variant of the toy droplet model of ref .  , the decrease with @xmath12 of the average @xmath17 for small @xmath38 was very slow , but the decrease of the median ( over the disorder ) was much faster .",
    "in fact , this median was compatible with zero for the larger systems studied in a whole interval of low @xmath38 values .",
    "therefore , the author advocated the study of this median as a silver bullet to distinguish a droplet - like behavior from a rsb - like behavior using numerical data .    in this paper we will develop this approach by studying the quantiles of the sample - dependent cumulative overlap distribution function @xmath40 whereas most numerical studies in the past focused on the disorder average @xmath41 and on low - order moments  @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 is the functional order parameter in rsb theory  @xcite . in a droplet picture",
    ", the average cumulative overlap distribution is expected to tend to a heaviside step function @xmath43 for large system sizes .",
    "in this section we introduce the statistical quantities that we will study in the following , and we review the mean - field predictions for their behavior ( the droplet picture does not imply any quantitative prediction about the scaling behavior , and we will address it through toy models , see sec .  [",
    "sec : toys ] ) .    the rsb mean - field analysis of the sk model offers precise predictions  @xcite ( valid in the thermodynamic limit ) on the statistics of the random variable @xmath44 defined in eq .  ( [ eq : xjq ] ) .",
    "the probability density @xmath45 , sometimes denoted by @xmath46 in the literature  @xcite , diverges at the origin as a power law , with an exponent equal to the average integrated overlap @xmath42 minus one ( @xmath47 has rather complex properties , with an infinite number of singular points ,  @xcite but the singularity at the origin is the strongest ) . for small",

    "it is equivalent to consider @xmath38 going to zero , since @xmath69 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath44 is very skewed for small values of @xmath38 .",
    "the most probable value is zero , and a majority of samples have values of @xmath44 much smaller than the average .",

    "any `` nice '' distribution would have an average and a median that would scale in the same way , possibly with different exponents ; in this case @xmath70 would go to one as @xmath73 .",
    "in this section we use numerical data obtained from parallel tempering simulations for the sk and eaimodel to study the cumulative overlap distributions and to test the mean - field predictions .",

    "we can obtain @xmath90 overlap measurements for each disorder sample , which we use to compute the @xmath44 .",
    "the overlap values either have been obtained directly during the numerical simulation that has generated the spin configurations or have been measured from stored thermalized configurations .",
    "@xmath90 is of order @xmath91 ( but for the eaidata with @xmath92 where it is of order @xmath93 ) .    in general",
    "this amount of information is sufficient to obtain a reasonable estimate for the single - sample overlap distributions .",
    "however , at small values of @xmath38 , where small values of @xmath94 occur with high probability , we encounter a potentially severe statistical problem .",
    "the monte carlo method estimates @xmath94 as a population ( i.e. , an integer number ) divided by @xmath90 .",
    "if the true value of @xmath94 is much smaller than @xmath95 , the monte carlo estimate will be exactly zero with a high probability ( namely @xmath96 ) .",
    "this effect is particularly important when estimating @xmath97 , which is sensitive to small changes in the values of the quantile @xmath55 .",
    "although small absolute uncertainties in the determination of @xmath44 do not have a large impact on the estimate of @xmath98 , measuring either a very small or a null quantile can make a huge difference in computing @xmath70 , which at small @xmath42 can result in either a quantity of order @xmath99 or exactly zero . for example take @xmath100 , roughly corresponding to @xmath101 , and try to estimate @xmath102 . if @xmath103 we are trying to estimate a number of order @xmath104 , that only requires limited statistics .",

    "we analyze the relevant physical quantities at the lowest temperature available ( @xmath88 for the sk model and @xmath84 for the eaimodel ) . due to the different critical parameters of both models ,",
    "these two temperatures are actually reasonably close in physical terms , as discussed in ref .  .",
