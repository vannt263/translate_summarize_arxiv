    "when optical , electromagnetic or acoustic signals are measured , often the measurement apparatus records an intensity , the magnitude of the signal amplitude , while discarding phase information .",
    "this is the case for x - ray crystallography @xcite , many optical and acoustic systems @xcite , and also an intrinsic feature of quantum measurements @xcite .",
    "phase retrieval is the procedure of determining missing phase information from suitably chosen intensity measurements , possibly with the use of additional signal characteristics @xcite .",
    "many of these instances of phase retrieval are related to the fourier transform @xcite , but it is also of interest to study this problem from an abstract point of view , using the magnitudes of any linear measurements to recover the missing information .",
    "next to infinite dimensional signal models @xcite , the finite dimensional case has received considerable attention in the past years @xcite . in this case , the signals are vectors in a finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 and one chooses a frame @xmath3 to obtain for each @xmath4 the magnitudes of the inner products with the frame vectors , @xmath5 . when recovering signals , we allow for a remaining undetermined global phase factor , meaning we identify vectors in the hilbert space @xmath2 that differ by a unimodular factor @xmath6 , @xmath7 , in the real or complex complex case .",
    "accordingly , we associate the equivalence class @xmath8=\\mathbb t x = \\{\\omega x : |\\omega|=1 \\}$ ] with a representative @xmath4 and consider the quotient space @xmath9 as the domain of the magnitude measurement map @xmath10)=(|\\langle x , f_j\\rangle|^2)_{j=1}^n$ ] .",
    "the map @xmath11 is well defined , because @xmath12 does not depend on the choice of @xmath13 .",
    "the metric on @xmath14 relevant for the accuracy of signal recovery is the quotient metric @xmath15 , which assigns to elements @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] with representatives @xmath17 the distance @xmath18,[y])=\\min_{|\\omega|=1}\\|x-\\omega y\\|$ ] .",
    "the case of signals in real hilbert spaces is now fairly well understood @xcite , while complex signals still pose many open problems . when the number of measured magnitudes is allowed to grow at a sufficient rate ,",
    "then techniques from low - rank matrix completion are applicable to phase retrieval @xcite , providing stable recovery from noisy measurements .",
    "other methods also achieve stability by a method that locally patches the phase information together @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that for a vector in a complex @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space , a generic choice of @xmath19 linear measurements is sufficient to recover the vector up to a unimodular factor from the magnitudes @xcite , complementing an earlier result on a deterministic choice of @xmath19 vectors @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , fully quantitative stability estimates were missing in this case of lowest redundancy known to be sufficient for recovery .",
    "a main objective of this paper is to find frames @xmath3 for the @xmath1-dimensional complex hilbert space such that @xmath20 is small and the magnitude measurement map is injective on @xmath9 with explicit error bounds for the approximate recovery when the magnitude measurements are affected by noise .",
    "more precisely , we find a left inverse of @xmath11 which extends to a neighborhood of the range of @xmath11 and is lipschitz continuous for all input signals whose signal - to - noise ratio is sufficiently large .",
    "we show that the recovery is implemented with an explicit algorithm that restores the signal from measurements to a given accuracy in a number of operations that is polynomial in the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "the algorithm can be chosen to be either phase propagation or what we call the kernel method , a special case of semidefinite programming .",
    "the smallest number of frame vectors for which we could provide an algorithm with explicit error bounds is @xmath0 , as presented here .    to formulate the main result ,",
    "it is convenient to take the hilbert space as a space of polynomials @xmath21 of maximal degree @xmath22 equipped with the standard inner product , see section  [ sec : poly ] for details . with this choice of hilbert space ,",
    "the magnitude measurements we use are expressed in terms of point evaluations .",

    ", the dirichlet    kernel is used to interpolate the perturbed measurements to functions    on the entire unit circle . in the noiseless case ,",
    "the magnitude    measurements @xmath47 determine the values    @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and    @xmath50 for each @xmath51 ,    because these are trigonometric polynomials of degree at most    @xmath22 . in the noisy case ,",
    "the interpolation using values    from @xmath44 , yields    trigonometric polynomials that differ from the unperturbed ones by at    most @xmath52 , uniformly on the unit    circle .",
    ": :    we select a suitable set of non - zero magnitude measurements from the    infinite family .",
    "a lemma will show that there exists a    @xmath53 on the unit circle such that the distance between    any element of @xmath54 and any roots of any    non - zero truncation of the polynomial @xmath33 is at least    @xmath55 .",
    "the reason why we need to consider all non - zero    truncations of the polynomial is that the influence of the noise    prevents us from determining the true degree of @xmath33 .",
    "however , when the coefficients of leading powers are sufficiently    small compared to the noise , we can replace @xmath33 with a    truncated polynomial without losing the order of approximation    accuracy . as a consequence ,",
    "we show that for this @xmath53 ,    @xmath56 with some    @xmath57 that only depends on the dimension @xmath1    and the norm of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , if the noise is sufficiently    small compared to the norm of the vector , then there is a similar    lower bound on the real trigonometric polynomials that interpolate the    noisy magnitude measurements .",
    ": :    in the last step , the reconstruction evaluates the trigonometric    approximations at the sample points @xmath54    and recovers an approximation to the equivalence class    @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "it is essential for this step that the sample    values are bounded away from zero in order to achieve a unique    reconstruction .",
    "there are two algorithms considered for this , phase    propagation , which recovers the phase iteratively using the phase    relation between sample points , and the kernel method , which computes    a vector in the kernel of a matrix determined by the magnitude    measurements .",
    "the error bound is first derived for phase propagation    and then related to that of the kernel method .",
    "both algorithms are    known to be polynomial time , either from the explicit description , or    from results in numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "the nature of the main result has also been observed in simulations ; assuming an a priori bound on the magnitude of the noise results in a worst - case recovery error that grows at most inverse proportional to the signal - to - noise ratio . outside of this regime , the error",
    "is not controlled in a linear fashion . to illustrate this , we include two plots of the typical behavior for the recovery error for @xmath59 .",
    "the range of the plots is chosen to show the behavior of the worst - case error in the linear regime and also for errors where this linear behavior breaks down .",
    "we tested the algorithm on more than 4.5 million randomly generated polynomials with norm 1 .",
    "when errors were graphed for a fixed polynomial , the linear bound for the worst - case error was confirmed , although the observed errors were many orders of magnitude less than the error bound given in this paper .",
    "a small number of polynomials we found exhibited a max - min value that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of all the other randomly generated polynomials .",
    "we chose the polynomial with the worst max - min value out of the 4.5 million that had been tried , and applied a random walk to its coefficients , with steps of decreasing size that were accepted only if the max - min value decreased .",
    "the random walk terminated at a polynomial which provided an error bound that is an order of magnitude worse than any other polynomials that had been tested before .",
    "this numerically found , local worst - case polynomial is given by @xmath60 .",
    "the accuracy of the coefficients displayed here is sufficient to reproduce the results initially obtained with floating point coefficients of double precision .",
    "the errors resulting for this polynomial in the linear and transition regimes are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .     as a function of the maximal noise magnitude in the linear regime.,width=345 ]     as a function of the maximal noise magnitude beyond the linear regime.,width=345 ]",
    "it is instructive to follow the construction of the magnitude measurements and the recovery strategy in the absence of noise .      to motivate and prepare the recovery strategy , we compare two recovery methods , phase propagation and the kernel method , a simple form of semidefinite programming , in the absence of noise and under additional non - orthogonality conditions on the input vector .    if @xmath61 is a basis for @xmath62 , and @xmath63 such that for all @xmath64 from @xmath65 to @xmath1 , @xmath66 then we call @xmath67 _ full _ with respect to @xmath61 .",
