    "multiferroics , with coexisting ferroelectric ( fe ) and magnetic orders that are mutually coupled , have attracted considerable interest for their technological relevance and fundamental science challenges.@xcite to avoid the natural exclusion between ferroelectricity and magnetism,@xcite there are several routes to achieve multiferroicity . based on the microscopic origin of the fe polarization ( @xmath3 )",
    ", multiferroics can be classified into two families.@xcite type - i multiferroics , where ferroelectricity and magnetism have different origins , often present high critical temperatures ( @xmath4 s ) and polarizations .",
    "however , the coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity is usually weak . in contrast",
    ", type - ii multiferroics ( i.e. magnetic multiferroics ) , where the ferroelectricity is caused by a particular magnetic order , are more interesting and important since both orders tend to be strongly coupled .    since the discovery of tbmno@xmath5,@xcite several magnetic multiferroics have been found .",
    "however , in the spiral spin multiferroics , the fe polarizations are regulated by the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction,@xcite which originates from the spin - orbit coupling and , thus , is very weak .",
    "this problem can be partially overcome in exchange - striction multiferroics .",
    "for instance , the predicted fe @xmath3 in the e - type afm manganites is of the order of @xmath6 @xmath7c / m@xmath8,@xcite which has been recently confirmed in experiments.@xcite however , the fe @xmath4 s of the e - type afm manganites remain low ( typically @xmath9 k)@xcite due to the magnetic frustration , namely the competition between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) exchange interactions.@xcite    among all the magnetic multiferroics , the narrow - bandwidth perovksite manganites define a very fertile field . in recent years , the undoped @xmath10mno@xmath5 case ( @xmath10 = rare earth ) has been intensively studied , both theoretically and experimentally . in addition , recent theoretical calculations predicted that _ doped _ manganites may provide additional magnetic multiferroic phases with even better physical properties.@xcite the expected spin structures of the new multiferroics are rather complex , involving zigzag - chains , and they are stabilized by mechanisms that do not involve superexchange frustration , such as electronic self - organization into stripes@xcite or correlation effects,@xcite that may be strong enough to obtain a high fe @xmath4 .",
    "also , the origin of the fe @xmath3 in these systems involves several aspects : not only a dm contribution from noncollinear spin pairs can be present , but also additional components triggered by spin dimmers and charge - orbital ordering are available.@xcite clearly , it would be important to test the general prediction of multiferroic complex states in real doped manganites .    in this manuscript , we will study the quadruple manganite camn@xmath0o@xmath1 , which is an ideal candidate to host new magnetic multiferroic phases . from the structural point of view",
    ", camn@xmath0o@xmath1 belongs to the quadruple ( aa@xmath5)b@xmath11o@xmath1 family , which becomes more explicit by writing the chemical formula as ( ca@xmath12mn@xmath13)(mn@xmath14)o@xmath15.@xcite this perovskite - derived structure consists of a three - dimensional array of corner - sharing bo@xmath16 octahedra , which are considerably tilted due to the small size of the a - site ( ca@xmath12mn@xmath13 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "therefore , the b - site mn - o - mn bond is short and bended , giving rise to a very narrow bandwidth system with robust dm interaction , considered very important in multiferroic manganites .",
    "in addition , different from normal perovskite manganites , the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion ( @xmath17 mode ) in camn@xmath0o@xmath1 is weak.@xcite this weak @xmath17 mode and a moderate jahn - teller @xmath18 mode can stabilize some multiferroic phases ( such as the predicted `` sos '' phase)@xcite which are difficult to form in normal narrow bandwidth perovskite manganites with strong jt distortion .",
    "furthermore , in this quadruple structure , the a - site ca@xmath12mn@xmath13 are fully ordered , different from the random distribution of a - site cations in standard chemically doped perovskites . the reduction of quenched disorder provides an extra advantage to stabilize complex spin patterns at a relatively high temperature ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "quadruple perovskite manganites have not been much studied,@xcite particularly with regards to their multiferroicity .",
    "et al_. and mezzadri _",
    "et al_. reported room-@xmath19 ferroelectricity ( evidenced from the cation displacements ) in bimn@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite however , its polarization is difficult to measure due to its low resistivity at room-@xmath19 .",
    "since the ferroelectricity in bimn@xmath0o@xmath1 is caused by the well - known @xmath20 lone pair of bi@xmath21 instead of a magnetic order , then this material is not a magnetic multiferroic . as for camn@xmath0o@xmath1 , snchez - andjar _",
    "et al_. reported a magnetodielectric effect at low @xmath19.@xcite however , it has been well recognized that a magnetodielectric effect may be unrelated to a true magnetoelectric coupling.@xcite    o@xmath1 .",

    "earlier neutron studies@xcite found that the fittings using collinear spin modes were not quite successful.@xcite thus , it is crucial to carry out additional high - precision neutron investigations to figure out better the magnetic order of camn@xmath0o@xmath1 , which is essential to further clarify its microscopic multiferroic mechanism .    recently , after our first submission of this manuscript , we noticed an experimental investigation by johnson _",

    ", the spin order between @xmath58 and @xmath57 has been resolved : this spin order is quite complex with a noncollinear structure ( involving both the a - site and b - site mn cations ) and it contradicts earlier neutron diffraction results.@xcite however , the magnetic order below @xmath57 remains unclear .",
    "therefore , overall the magnetic multiferroic character of camn@xmath0o@xmath1 is nicely confirmed by johnson _",
    "_ , while the clarification of the underlying microscopic mechanism still needs further experimental and theoretical careful investigations .",
    "in summary , we have found that the quadruple perovskite camn@xmath0o@xmath1 is a magnetic multiferroic material .",
    "its multiferroic properties are interesting ( large-@xmath3 , high-@xmath89 , and a strong magnetoelectric response ) when compared with other known magnetic multiferroic manganites .",
    "a new physical mechanism appears to be needed to explain our results .",
    "considered more broadly , these results for camn@xmath0o@xmath1 open a new route to pursue higher-@xmath89 and larger-@xmath3 magnetic multiferroics via the use of doped oxides .",
    "this is interesting since most previous verified multiferroic materials are actually undoped , since doping was expected to bring extra carriers and destroy the insulating behavior required by ferroelectricity .",
    "our results show that this is not necessarily correct for narrow - bandwidth oxides .",
