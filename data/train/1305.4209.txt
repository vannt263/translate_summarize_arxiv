    "in this work we consider scattering of massless spin-1/2 particles by the gravitational field of finite - sized bodies whose radius @xmath0 slightly exceeds the schwarzschild radius @xmath3 . here",

    "the spacetime around the body is described using a suitable metric to model its interior , which is joined at the surface of the body to the standard schwarzschild metric outside .",
    "we find that for @xmath0 approaching @xmath1 , the scattering is characterized by a dense spectrum of narrow resonances , i.e. , metastable states whose lifetime and energy density tend to infinity in the black - hole limit .",

    "the ratio @xmath11 for the fixed energy of the particle remains finite .",
    "this allows one to define the cross section for particle capture into these long - lived states using the optical model @xcite , i.e. , averaging over a small energy interval containing many resonances . in doing",
    "so we recover the low - energy limit of the absorption cross section for a pure black hole ( with the boundary condition of complete absorption at the event horizon ) derived by unruh : @xmath12 for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 partial waves @xcite .",
    "the total absorption cross section considering all partial - wave contributions is @xmath15 , as only the @xmath13 and @xmath14 waves have nonvanishing cross sections at zero energy .",
    "thus we observe that at low incident particle energies the absorption properties of a body with @xmath16 resemble those of a black hole .",
    "it is worth noting that possible inelastic processes , such as radiation by the particles captured in the long - lived resonances , do not change @xmath17 .",
    "the presence of inelastic processes increases the total width of the resonances , @xmath18 , but this quantity drops out of the energy averaged ( optical ) total capture cross section @xmath19 , leaving only the dependence on the elastic width @xmath8 @xcite .    as in the previous work on the scalar ( spin-0 ) case @xcite",
