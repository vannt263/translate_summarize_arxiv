    "conventional superconductors are well described by eliashberg theory@xcite which treats superconductivity as a boson - exchange phenomenon . the dominant feature of this theory is the electron - phonon interaction spectral function @xmath1 which can be determined from tunneling experiments@xcite or theoretically from band structure calculations .",
    "using such an @xmath1 within eliashberg theory allows to reproduce the superconducting properties of a conventional superconductor within experimental accuracy and this established the phonons as the exchange boson between the two charge carriers building the cooper pair in conventional superconductors .",
    "concentrating on isotropic systems carbotte @xcite developed the concept of an optimum spectrum based on earlier work of leavens@xcite and mitrovi and carbotte.@xcite such a spectrum can be developed from a theorem which states that for a given strength @xmath2 of the spectral density @xmath1 the best shape that will maximize the critical temperature @xmath3 is a delta function spectrum @xmath4,\\ ] ] with the delta function placed at the frequency @xmath5 at which the functional derivative @xmath6 displays its maximum for a fixed value of the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath7 .",
    "carbotte@xcite extended this concept to encompass other physical properties such as @xmath8 , the zero temperature gap @xmath9 to @xmath3 ratio , and a number of others .",
    "this concept establishes that a relation @xmath10 always exists , where @xmath11 stands for @xmath3 , @xmath8 , etc .",
    "and @xmath12 is a universal number determined from eliashberg theory for each property @xmath11 and which varies only slightly with @xmath7 .",
    "in essence the optimum spectrum gives information about the phonon frequency important to maximize a certain physical property ( such as @xmath3 ) of a conventional superconductor .",
    "such a concept is very appealing and it suggests an expansion to the concept of an _ optimal _ spectrum which is again a delta peak spectrum with a delta peak of strength @xmath13 at some position @xmath5 both chosen to reproduce all known properties of a superconductor optimally .",
    "such a spectrum will then provide information on the phonon mode most important for a specific superconductor if an @xmath1 can not be derived from experiment .",
    "it can also help to develop an @xmath1 in all cases where the phonon density of states @xmath14 is known .",
    "we would like to put this concept to test using the borocarbides  and  for which extensive experimental data exist@xcite and for which @xmath14 is known from theoretical work.@xcite from experimental data of the upper critical field @xmath15 which displays a pronounced upward curvature close to @xmath3 in single crystal@xcite and polycrystalline@xcite samples we also assume these systems to be anisotropic.@xcite shulga _ et al._@xcite explained this upward curvature of @xmath16 close to @xmath3 by considering two bands , one of which being more deeply involved in the transport properties of the compound .",
    "the authors utilized an @xmath17-wave electron - phonon eliashberg formalism and there is growing evidence that the order parameter in  is indeed of @xmath17-wave symmetry.@xcite it is interesting to note in passing that concept introduced by prohammer and schachinger@xcite is effectively a two - band model described by an anisotropic electron - phonon interaction spectral density.@xcite    sec .",
    "ii of this paper reviews the theoretical background , sec .",
    "iii discusses the results of our analysis , and , finally , in sec .",
    "iv our conclusions are drawn .",
    "the theoretical approach towards a theory of anisotropic polycrystalline superconductors within the framework of eliashberg theory is based on the separable model for the anisotropic electron - phonon interaction introduced by markovitz and kadanoff@xcite which was extended by daams and carbotte@xcite to describe an anisotropic electron - phonon interaction spectral function : @xmath18 where * k * and @xmath19 are the incoming and outgoing quasi - particle momentum vectors in the electron - phonon scattering process and @xmath20 is an anisotropy function with the important feature @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the fermi surface average . as anisotropy effects are generally assumed to be rather small , it is sufficient to keep the mean square anisotropy @xmath23 as the important anisotropy parameter . finally , @xmath1 is the electron - phonon interaction spectral density of the equivalent isotropic system .",
    "thermodynamic properties of a superconductor are calculated from the free energy difference @xmath24 between the normal and superconducting state:@xcite @xmath25 with the quasiparticle density of states @xmath26 at the fermi level , the renormalized quasiparticle frequencies @xmath27 and the matsubara gaps @xmath28 which are the solutions of the nonlinear @xmath17-wave eliashberg equations :    [ eq : eli ] @xmath29    the @xmath30 are the normal state quasiparticle frequencies determined by @xmath31 in these equations @xmath32 , the cutoff frequency , is usually an integer multiple of the debye frequency of the system , @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the anisotropic scattering rate due to inelastic impurity scattering with @xmath35 as the anisotropic transport relaxation time , @xmath36 is the anisotropic coulomb pseudopotential , and @xmath37    in case of weak anisotropy effects the @xmath38 dependence of the coulomb pseudopotential and of the impurity scattering is neglected and the anisotropy of the matsubara gaps is described by the ansatz @xmath39 with @xmath40 being isotropic functions . in applying equation ( [ delsep ] ) to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eli ] ) only terms of the order of @xmath41 are kept .",
    "the upper critical field @xmath16 of an anisotropic polycrystalline superconductor employs , in addition , a separable ansatz to describe the anisotropy of the fermi velocity @xmath42@xcite @xmath43 with @xmath44 the isotropic fermi velocity .",
    "@xmath45 is an anisotropy function defined in the same way as @xmath20 .",
    "again , only terms of the order @xmath46 are kept in case of small anisotropy effects . the upper critical field in its temperature dependence",
    "is then described by the following set of equations:@xcite    [ hc2 ] @xmath47    and @xmath48",
    "as there are no data available which would allow to determine the electron - phonon interaction spectral density @xmath1 directly by inversion , we have to start our analysis using the phonon density of states @xmath14 which is known from theoretical work.@xcite we construct the electron - phonon interaction spectral density using the ansatz @xmath49 with constants @xmath50 and @xmath17 . the coupling strength between electrons and phonons is generally assumed to become weaker with increasing energy @xmath51 which leaves @xmath17 to be negative and it is set to @xmath52 for simplicity , a value which was also proposed by junod _",

    "the actual energy dependence of the @xmath1 spectrum is of no importance as we are going to replace the @xmath1 by an einstein spectrum with its @xmath0-peak of strength @xmath13 at some fixed frequency @xmath5 with @xmath13 and @xmath5 chosen to give the measured @xmath3 , the appropriate value for @xmath58 , and the best possible fit to experiment .",
    "nevertheless , these @xmath1 spectra already give a pretty good idea where to place the @xmath0-peak because a quite natural choice is to place the @xmath0-peak at the center of the area under the respective @xmath1 spectrum .",

    "( [ alphak ] ) . in order to remove ambiguities , an experimental value of the average fermi velocity @xmath44 can be derived from the plasma frequency @xmath77 by using @xmath78 for  @xmath79mev@xcite which results in @xmath80 m/s .",

    "the same procedure can be applied to analyze the experimental data of  in a clean limit approach using a single peak einstein spectrum .",
    "the peak is set at the energy @xmath85mev , again close to the center of area under the @xmath1 spectrum ( solid triangles , fig .",
    "[ b_spek ] ) .",
    "the results of such a calculation are presented in table  [ t1 ] and compared to the  anisotropy parameters .",
    "this proves that it is indeed possible to describe the features of  and  rather well using eliashberg theory for anisotropic @xmath17-wave superconductors and a simple einstein spectrum to describe the energy dependence of the electron - phonon interaction spectral density .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement at low temperatures is still not perfect ( see insets of figs .  [ y_delta_hc ] and [ y_delta_hc2 ] ) which demonstrate that the low temperature data are somewhat overestimated by our analysis .      in reality",
    ", the sample develops some residual resistivity at low temperatures which is an indication of some impurity content .",
    "thus , a clean limit analysis of experimental data as it was presented in the previous subsection can only be a first step which allows to put some margins on the various anisotropy parameters .",
    "it would then be standard procedure@xcite to load the sample under investigation in a controlled way with some impurities and to measure the change in @xmath3 and in the residual resistivity @xmath86 as a function of impurity concentration .",
    "this gives another , rather reliable estimate for the anisotropy parameter @xmath23@xcite and allows to calculate the impurity parameter @xmath87 which enters eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eli ] ) and ( [ hc2 ] ) from the drude relation @xmath88    such data is not available for  and  and we have to develop a different strategy to achieve a more realistic simulation . we make use of the fact that the critical temperature of an anisotropic clean limit system @xmath89 , @xmath90 , is always greater than the critical temperature of a realistic system with @xmath91 .",
    "one can therefore choose a hypothetical value for @xmath90 and calculate how @xmath3 decreases with increasing values of @xmath87 for a fixed value of @xmath23 .",
    "results of such a calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ ytctplus ] ( solid line for @xmath92k and @xmath75 , dashed line for @xmath92k and @xmath93 , dotted line for @xmath94k and @xmath93 , and dash - dotted line for @xmath95k and @xmath96 ) .",
    "this defines the value @xmath87 necessary in the simulation for the realistic system to obtain the experimental value of the critical temperature ( labeled @xmath3 ,  in fig .",
    "[ ytctplus ] )",
    ".    we also have to keep in mind that adding impurities increases @xmath16 even in isotropic systems.@xcite moreover , adding impurities ` smears out ' the anisotropy@xcite which results in increasing values of @xmath68 and an additional increase of @xmath16 , and , furthermore , in a less pronounced upward curvature of @xmath16 close to @xmath3@xcite if @xmath23 and @xmath46 are kept constant in the calculations .",
    "thus , one will have to compensate for adding impurities by an increase of the anisotropy parameters . on the other hand",
    ", the anisotropy parameters found for the clean limit system already seem to be rather realistic ( they are close to the values given by manalo _",
    "et al._@xcite found by a more elaborate analysis ) and we will therefore relay to other means to reestablish agreement with experiment .    adding a second @xmath0-peak to the @xmath1 spectrum with its position and strength chosen that , again , the best possible agreement with experiment can be established by changing the anisotropy parameters only minimally is suggested by functional derivatives @xmath97.@xcite in particular , functional derivatives reveal that adding spectral weight at high energies to the @xmath1 spectrum makes it less effective for @xmath16 at low temperatures while adding spectral weight at low energies has just the opposite effect . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath16 is far less sensitive to changes in the spectral weight .",
    "this is of importance as our calculations overestimate @xmath16 at low temperatures already for the clean limit system in the case of  ( fig .",
    "[ y_delta_hc2 ] ) .",
    "we therefore add some spectral weight at higher energies and a natural choice for the energy @xmath98 at which this second @xmath0-peak is to be placed is the energy of the maximum in the @xmath1 spectrum , i.e. @xmath99mev for  ( fig .  [ b_spek ] ) .",
    "the strength @xmath100 of this second peak is chosen to be a tenth of the strength @xmath13 of the primary @xmath0-peak .",
    "this new 2@xmath0-peak spectrum has then to be rescaled to reproduce the experimental value of @xmath3 for the fixed value @xmath55 .",
    "this procedure results in a @xmath101 just marginally smaller than the @xmath58 of the einstein spectrum .    using this new @xmath102-spectrum @xmath68 and @xmath16",
    "are recalculated with the parameters shown in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "the results for @xmath68 are presented in fig .",
    "[ y_thermo ] .",
    "we see that the low temperature values of @xmath68 are still slightly overestimated by our model calculations , and the results for @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ y_2delta_hc2 ] ) reveal that @xmath16 is now a bit underestimated at very low temperatures but otherwise the agreement is almost perfect for all sets of impurity and anisotropy parameters .    again , the same procedure can be applied to the system .",
    "we use a 2@xmath0-spectrum with the second peak placed at the maximum in the @xmath1 spectrum ( solid triangles , fig .",
    "[ b_spek ] ) @xmath103mev and with its strength given by @xmath104 because @xmath16 was originally slightly underestimated .",
    "the resulting @xmath105 and the anisotropy parameters for best agreement with experimental data found for this @xmath102-spectrum are quoted in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "it is important to emphasize at this point that the agreement between theoretical predictions and experiment is equally good for all sets of parameters quoted in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "thus , only an experiment in which the residual resistivity of the sample is measured can finally help in pinning down the ` real ' anisotropy parameters .",
    "our analysis only helped to substantially narrow the range of realistic values of the anisotropy parameters .",
    "we investigated two borocarbide systems , namely  and , to prove whether the concept of an optimal electron - phonon interaction spectrum is applicable to anisotropic superconductors in general and to the borocarbides in particular .",
    "such a concept seems to be very helpful if only little is known about the electron - phonon interaction spectral function @xmath1 .",
    "this concept is indeed applicable to anisotropic clean limit systems where an einstein spectrum with its peak placed near the center of the area under a model-@xmath1 spectrum proved sufficient to obtain an excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experiment over the whole temperature range for thermodynamics and @xmath16 .",
    "the latter is particularly sensitive to anisotropy effects and details in @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , even for this property excellent agreement could be achieved .",
    "this proves that the model of an anisotropic electron - phonon interaction spectral function @xmath106 can be used to explain the upward curvature of @xmath16 close to @xmath3 .",
    "systems with impurities require compensation of the smearing out of anisotropy by increasing the values of the anisotropy parameters @xmath23 and @xmath46 if the einstein spectrum concept is to be extended even to this case .",
    "this could result in rather big values for these parameters and in unrealistic values of @xmath44 necessary to reproduce @xmath16 on an absolute scale . as a way out of this problem we offer to allow the optimal spectrum to be a 2@xmath0-spectrum with the position of the main peak determined from clean limit calculations .",
    "our analysis suggests various critical temperatures @xmath90 for the clean - limit system which is the ` origin ' of the realistic sample . measuring the residual resistivity of the sample under investigation",
    "will then determine @xmath87 which in turn gives the appropriate anisotropy parameters ( see table  [ t2 ] ) .",
    "finally , the applicability of the concept of an optimal @xmath1 spectrum to the systems  and proved that both are classical @xmath17-wave electron - phonon superconductors adequately described by an eliashberg theory of anisotropic superconductors .",
