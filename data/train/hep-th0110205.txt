    "what measurements are possible in a gauge field theory ? since the interactions of the elementary constituents of matter are described by gauge theory , hardly any question could be more fundamental . yet definitive answers are elusive .",
    "the wilson loop operators associated with closed spacelike paths provide a complete characterization of a gauge - field configuration in terms of gauge - invariant quantities @xcite . therefore , in formulations of gauge theories ,",
    "wilson loops are often taken to be the basic observables .",
    "but we will show that nondemolition measurements of spacelike wilson loops are impossible in a non - abelian gauge theory that respects relativistic causality .",
    "we reach this conclusion by arguing that any procedure for nondemolition measurement of a spacelike non - abelian wilson loop would allow information to be transmitted outside the forward light cone .",
    "causality places no such restriction on the measurability of an abelian wilson loop ( one evaluated in a one - dimensional irreducible representation of the gauge group ) , and indeed we find that nondemolition measurement of an abelian wilson loop is possible .",
    "we also find that , in gauge theories with suitable matter content , _ destructive _ measurements of non - abelian wilson loops are possible . by destructive measurements we mean ones that , in contrast to nondemolition measurements , inflict damage on wilson loop eigenstates .    in a quantum field theory in flat spacetime , described in the schrdinger picture , what do we mean by a nondemolition `` measurement '' of an observable defined on a time slice ?",
    "typically , such a measurement requires the cooperation of many parties who are distributed over the slice , and is a three - step process . in the first step ( which might not be necessary )",
    ", a suitable entangled quantum state ( the `` ancilla '' ) is prepared and distributed to the parties .",
    "second , each party performs a local operation on her local field variables and her part of the entangled ancilla .",
    "third , classical or quantum information extracted by the parties in the second step is shipped to a central location where the readout of the result is completed .",
    "although the outcome of the measurement is not known until the third step is completed , the coherence of a superposition of eigenstates of the observable with distinct eigenvalues is already destroyed in the second step , which is carried out on the time slice where the operator is defined . at that time , the density operator @xmath2 encoding the quantum state of the field theory is transformed according to @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the set of orthogonal projectors onto the eigenspaces of the observable .",
    "the term `` nondemolition '' means that if the state prior to the measurement is an eigenstate of the observable , then the state will be unaffected by the measurement .",
    "any permissible way in which a quantum state can change is described by a _ quantum operation _ , a completely positive trace - nonincreasing linear map of density operators to density operators @xcite .",
    "the orthogonal measurement @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ meas_so ] ) , summed over its possible outcomes , is a special type of quantum operation .",
    "it is natural to ask , what are the quantum operations that can really be executed on a time slice in a relativistic quantum theory ?",
    "the general answer is not known , but it _ is _ known that many operations are unphysical because they run afoul of relativistic causality @xcite .",
    "consider , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : causal ] , two parties alice and bob who perform spacelike - separated actions . just prior to the implementation of @xmath5",
    ", alice performs a local operation on the fields in her vicinity , and just after the implementation of @xmath5 , bob performs a local measurement of the fields in his vicinity . if bob is able to acquire any information about what local operation alice chose to apply , then alice has successfully sent a superluminal signal to bob .",
    "if an operation allows such superluminal signaling , we say that the operation is _ acausal _ ; otherwise , it is causal .",
    "physically realizable operations must be causal .",
    "we will apply this causality criterion to non - abelian gauge theories , and will argue that nondemolition measurement of a wilson loop operator is an acausal operation .    in discussing the locality properties of a field theory ,",
    "it is convenient to use the concept of a `` reduced '' density operator that encodes the observations that are accessible to an agent acting in a bounded spatial region .",
    "this density operator is obtained from a density operator for the full system by `` tracing out '' the degrees of freedom in the unobserved region . in a gauge theory , performing a partial trace involves potential subtleties arising from the gauss law constraint satisfied by physical states . for conceptual clarity , we will sidestep these difficulties by founding our discussion on the concept of charge super - selection sectors @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , our analysis applies to the `` free - charge '' phase of a weakly - coupled gauge theory with non - abelian gauge group @xmath6 ; the local symmetry is unbroken and @xmath6 charges are unconfined .",
    "the same argument , though , shows that wilson loop measurement would allow superluminal signaling in a confining gauge theory , where the separation between the communicating parties is small compared to the confinement distance scale .",
    "the protocol by which alice can exploit measurement of the spacelike wilson loop operator @xmath0 to send a signal to bob is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wilson ] .",
    "first alice and bob , acting on the weakly - coupled ground state with gauge - invariant local probes , both create _ magnetic flux tubes_. bob s flux tube links with the loop @xmath1 ; alice encodes one bit of classical information by placing her tube in one of two possible positions , either linking with @xmath1 or not . in the framework of lattice gauge theory",
    ", we may imagine that bob has control of a single lattice link @xmath7 contained in the loop @xmath1 , and he creates his `` flux tube '' by manipulating his link  exciting the lattice plaquettes that contain @xmath7 to a particular nontrivial conjugacy class of @xmath6 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : link ] .",
    "similarly , alice controls a single link @xmath8 and she encodes a bit by either exciting her link or not .",
    "of course , since alice and bob act locally and the theory respects a charge superselection rule , the flux tubes created by alice and bob have trivial electric charge .",
    "if either bob s tube or alice s tube links with the loop @xmath1 , but not both , then the configuration is an eigenstate of @xmath0 ( or close to an eigenstate in the weakly - coupled case ) and will be unaffected ( or little affected ) by the measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "but if both tubes link with @xmath1 , the configuration is not an eigenstate , and will be altered by the measurement .",
    "we will see that , with nonvanishing probability , the measurement will generate equal and opposite nonzero electric charges on alice s tube and bob s .",
    "then , by measuring the charge on his tube , bob can infer ( with a success probability better than a random guess ) whether alice s tube linked with @xmath1 or not , and so receive a superluminal signal .",
    "in a non - abelian gauge theory , a magnetic flux tube can carry a peculiar kind of electric charge that has no localized source , which has been called cheshire charge @xcite .",
    "( the property that the _ charge _ of an excitation in a non - abelian gauge theory need not be the integral of a local density is analogous to the property that the _ energy _ of an object in general relativity need not be the integral of a local density . )",
    "our protocol for superluminal signaling is based on the observation that wilson loop measurement causes cheshire charge to be transferred from alice s flux tube to bob s .",
    "cheshire charge , while conceptually elusive , is physically genuine and readily detected in principle .",
    "our conclusion that wilson loop measurement is an acausal operation does not hold in the case of an abelian gauge theory . indeed",
    ", we will show that a nondemolition measurement of @xmath0 is possible in an abelian gauge theory that includes charged matter . in our analysis of this case",
    ", we adopt the convenient idealization that the parties who perform the measurement are equipped with gauge - invariant ancilla variables that are not themselves described by the gauge theory .",
    "we will also see that a _ destructive _ measurement of a non - abelian wilson loop ( a measurement that determines the value of the wilson loop but in doing so damages wilson loop eigenstates ) is possible in a gauge theory that includes suitable charged matter .",
    "in particular , if the matter transforms faithfully under the gauge group , then the wilson loop can be measured destructively in any representation of the gauge group .    the conclusion that nondemolition measurement of spacelike wilson loops is impossible in a non - abelian gauge theory seems surprising and somewhat troubling , as it leaves us without a fully satisfactory way to characterize the configurations of a quantized relativistic gauge theory in terms of measurable quantities .",
    "related difficulties arise in quantum theories of gravity .",
    "that nondemolition measurement of a wilson loop operator would allow superluminal signaling has been anticipated by sorkin @xcite .",

    "[ sec : sctl ] , concluding that superluminal transport of abelian charge , but not non - abelian charge , is possible .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains some concluding comments .",
    "in a theory with gauge group @xmath6 , the effect of parallel transport of a charged object around a closed path @xmath1 that begins and ends at the point @xmath9 can be encoded in a group element @xmath10 given by @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the gauge potential and @xmath13 denotes path ordering ; the state @xmath14 of a charged object carried along @xmath1 is modified according to @xmath15 if @xmath14 transforms as the unitary irreducible representation @xmath16 of @xmath6 .",
    "the element @xmath10 depends on a `` gauge choice '' at the point @xmath9 ; that is , on how a basis is chosen in the representation @xmath16 .",
    "a basis - independent characterization of the gauge holonomy is obtained if we evaluate the trace in the representation @xmath16 , obtaining the wilson loop operator associated with @xmath1 given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the character of the representation @xmath16 .",
    "the wilson loop operator does not depend on how the point @xmath9 on the loop @xmath1 is chosen . in much of what follows , we will assume for notational simplicity that the unbroken gauge group @xmath6 is finite ; however , our arguments can be easily extended to the case of compact lie groups .    by acting with a gauge - invariant source on the weakly - coupled ground state of the gauge theory , alice ( or bob ) can create a `` color magnetic flux tube '' or `` cosmic string '' that carries trivial `` color electric '' charge .",
    "this tube is an eigenstate of the wilson loop operator @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a loop that links once with the tube , for any irreducible representation @xmath21 of the gauge group g ; hence the tube can be labeled by a conjugacy class @xmath22 of @xmath6 .",
    "when we say that the tube has trivial gauge charge , we mean that it transforms as the trivial representation of @xmath6 under global gauge transformations . to understand this property it is helpful to specify a basepoint @xmath23 on the loop @xmath20 and to fix the gauge at this point .",
    "then the effect of parallel transport around the loop @xmath20 , beginning and ending at @xmath23 , can be encoded ( in this particular gauge ) in a group element @xmath24 .",
    "if the tube is associated with a particular group element @xmath25 , we call its quantum state a `` flux eigenstate , '' denoted @xmath26 .",
    "but under a gauge transformation @xmath27 at @xmath23 , this flux eigenstate is transformed as @xmath28 thus a flux eigenstate is not a gauge singlet in general , if @xmath6 is non - abelian .",
    "a gauge - singlet quantum state of the flux tube is a coherent superposition of the flux eigenstates belonging to conjugacy class @xmath22 , @xmath29 denotes the number of members of the class",
    ".    other possible states of the flux tube can carry nontrivial electric charge .",
    "for example , the state @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is a normalization factor and @xmath32 ) transforms as the nontrivial irreducible representation @xmath33 under global gauge transformations . to verify this , first construct the operator @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the order of the group , @xmath36 is the dimension of the irreducible representation @xmath33 , and @xmath37 is the global gauge transformation that conjugates the flux by @xmath38 , @xmath39 using the group orthogonality relations @xmath40 we find that @xmath41 is the orthogonal projection onto the space transforming as @xmath33 , which satisfies @xmath42",
    "applying the orthogonality relations once more , we see that @xmath43 thus @xmath44 transforms as @xmath33 .",
    "the `` cheshire charge '' carried by the flux tube in this state can be detected through , for example , the aharonov - bohm interactions of the tube with other , distant , flux tubes @xcite .",
    "suppose that alice and bob , acting locally , each create flux tubes with zero electric charge , where the flux of alice s tube belongs to conjugacy class @xmath22 and the flux of bob s belongs to conjugacy class @xmath45 .",
    "( the process of preparing the flux tubes will be discussed in more detail in sec .  [",
    "sec : flux ] . ) to describe the quantum state of this configuration , we may choose loops @xmath20 and @xmath46 that link with the tubes , and fix the gauge at basepoints @xmath23 and @xmath47 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loops]a .",
    "up to a normalization factor , the quantum state of the two tubes can be expressed as @xmath48 where @xmath32 and @xmath49 .",
    "this configuration is a direct product of the state of alice s tube with the state of bob s tube , a simultaneous eigenstate of the commuting wilson loop operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "but because multiplication of conjugacy classes is ill - defined , this state is not an eigenstate of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the loop shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loops]b that links with both tubes .",
    "rather , if alice s tube is an eigenstate of @xmath50 and bob s tube is an eigenstate of @xmath51 , then an eigenstate of @xmath0 is not a product state but an entangled state of the form ( up to normalization ) @xmath52 this state has zero total charge , as it is invariant under a global gauge transformation applied to both tubes .",
    "but it is not invariant under a gauge transformation that acts on just one of the tubes ; it can be expanded in a basis in which alice s tube and bob s have definite and opposite charges . using the group orthogonality relations in the form @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is the identity element ) , we may rewrite the state as a sum over irreducible representations @xmath55 the expression in parentheses transforms as @xmath33 under gauge transformations acting on bob s tube and as the conjugate representation @xmath56 under gauge transformations acting on alice s tube , as we can verify by applying @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    thus , when two flux tubes are prepared in a quantum state that is an eigenstate of the wilson loop operator @xmath0 , where @xmath1 links with both flux tubes , then the flux tubes carry correlated nontrivial electric charges .",
    "this property is the basis of our claim that wilson loop measurement is acausal , as we elaborate in the next section .",
    "for a _ static _ gauge field configuration , it is possible in principle to measure @xmath59 ( and hence the conjugacy class of the group element @xmath60 ) by performing interference experiments with projectiles that transform as @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "but what if the loop @xmath1 lies in a time slice and the gauge field is _ dynamical _ ? in a relativistic field theory , no projectile can follow a spacelike world line , so that a direct measurement of the effect of parallel transport along @xmath1 is not feasible",
    ".    however , it seems conceivable that a less direct measurement strategy might succeed .",
    "when we speak of a `` measurement '' of an operator whose support is on a spacelike slice , we need not require that the result be instantaneously known by anyone .",
    "we might imagine instead that , in order to measure @xmath59 at time @xmath61 , many parties distributed along the loop @xmath1 perform local operations at @xmath61 .",
    "later , the data collected by the parties can be assembled and processed at a central laboratory , where the outcome of the measurement of @xmath59 can be determined .",
    "in such a protocol , we should allow the parties to share any entangled quantum state that they might have prepared prior to @xmath61 , and we should allow them to ship quantum information ( rather than just classical data ) to the central laboratory after they have performed their local operations . of course , the quantum or classical variables that are sent to the central laboratory for analysis are not the variables of the underlying field theory ; they are ancilla variables that are assumed to be available to assist with the measurement .    just prior to the measurement at time @xmath61 ,",
    "the quantum state of the gauge theory is @xmath2 , a density operator that acts on the physical gauge - invariant subspace .",
    "even though the measurement result may not be known until later , the operations performed at @xmath61 modify the state @xmath2 immediately .",
    "if the local operations performed at @xmath61 are to achieve a measurement of @xmath59 , then the coherence of a superposition of eigenstates of @xmath2 with different eigenvalues must be destroyed . at @xmath61 , then , the quantum state is modified according to @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the orthogonal projector onto the subspace of states with @xmath64 this operation describes a projective measurement of @xmath59 with an unknown outcome .",
    "the operation @xmath65 is actually weaker than a measurement of @xmath59 ; conceivably decoherence in the basis of eigenstates of an observable can be accomplished even if the measurement outcome is _ never _ recorded .",
    "but if any record of the value of @xmath59 is written at @xmath61 ( even one that can not be read until later ) , then decoherence as described by eq .",
    "( [ wilson_decohere ] ) must occur .",
    "we will show that @xmath65 can be used to send superluminal signals , and so establish that @xmath65 can not be implemented in a gauge theory that respects relativistic causality .    to devise a superluminal signaling protocol , alice and bob use local gauge - invariant probes to prepare uncharged flux tubes belonging to classes @xmath22 and @xmath45 respectively , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : wilson ] .",
    "bob moves his flux tube , which will receive the message , into position so that it links once with the loop @xmath1 ; alice encodes one bit of information by choosing to place her flux tube in one of two possible positions , either linking with @xmath1 or not .",
    "if alice chooses to place her tube where it does not link with @xmath1 , then the configuration is an eigenstate of @xmath59 and will be unaffected when the wilson loop is measured .",
    "but if alice moves her flux tube into position to link with @xmath1 , then the configuration is no longer an eigenstate of @xmath59 , and it _ is _ affected by the operation @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , after the operation , though the total charge of the system remains zero , there is a nonzero probability that alice s tube and bob s tube carry equal and opposite nonzero charges .",
    "this charge can be detected by bob .",
    "for example , he can determine whether his tube has vacuum quantum numbers by allowing it to shrink and observing whether it will annihilate and disappear  if the tube is charged , a stable charged particle will be left behind .",
    "thus , if there were a way to implement the operation @xmath65 at @xmath61 , then by observing whether his flux tube is charged after @xmath61 , bob would be able to infer ( with a probability of success better than a random guess ) whether alice moved her tube into position or not .",
    "therefore alice can transmit classical information to bob over a noisy channel with nonzero capacity ; she is able to send a superluminal signal to bob . by the same method , bob can send a signal to alice .    to understand this charge transfer process in more detail ,",
    "let us consider a specific example .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is the _ quaternionic group _ of order eight , whose two - dimensional faithful unitary irreducible representation is @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the pauli matrices .",
    "suppose that alice and bob both have tubes carrying flux in the class @xmath68 . for tubes in this class ,",
    "the quantum state with trivial charge is @xmath69 and there is also a state of nontrivial charge @xmath70 the state @xmath71 transforms as the nontrivial one - dimensional representation of @xmath6 in which @xmath72 , @xmath73 are represented by 1 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 are represented by @xmath76 .    if alice and bob each have a charge - zero flux tube , the quantum state of their two tubes is a product state @xmath77 but",
    "if the loop @xmath1 links once with each tube , then the value of @xmath59 in the two - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath33 can be either @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "if the initial state @xmath80 is projected onto the state with @xmath81 , alice s tube becomes entangled with bob s ; the resulting state is @xmath82 bob s final density operator , obtained by tracing over the state of alice s tube , is latexmath:[\\[\\rho_{b,{\\rm fin } , 2}= { 1\\over 2}\\left ( | i\\sigma_1\\rangle \\langle i\\sigma_1| +     mixture _ of the two flux eigenstates .",

    "s final density operator is @xmath86 each of the two flux eigenstates is an equally weighted coherent superposition of the charge eigenstates @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "thus if bob were to measure the charge of his tube after the operation @xmath65 acts at @xmath61 , he would find the charge to be @xmath89 with probability 1/2 if alice s tube linked with the loop @xmath1 , while he would never find the charge to be @xmath89 if alice s tube did not link with @xmath1 .",
    "alice has sent a superluminal signal to bob .",
    "we can easily generalize this construction to an arbitrary finite gauge group @xmath6 .",

    "a modification of the conventions can be interpreted as a rotation in the flavor space , under which the variable @xmath188 transforms .",
    "now consider a large loop @xmath1 on the spatial lattice , and suppose that many parties distributed along the loop are to measure the wilson loop @xmath190 in representation @xmath33 .",

    "to understand the point heuristically , consider the case of `` quarks '' that come in three colors but only one flavor .",
    "rather than using `` natural '' flavors to keep track of our color conventions , we can use `` artificial '' flavors instead , labeling red , yellow , and blue quarks with the three mutually orthogonal states ( up , down , strange ) of the ancilla .",
    "when quarks are transported from one site to a neighboring site , the attached value of the ancilla is transported along with the color ; hence artificial flavors , just like natural flavors , allow us to describe local gauge transport in terms of gauge - invariant quantities . since we can construct composite matter fields in any representation @xmath33 of @xmath6 , and we can use ancillas to ensure that matter transforming as @xmath33 comes in @xmath36 flavors , our simulated matter transforms as the regular representation ; thus we can measure destructively a wilson loop in any representation .",
    "what about the case of a pure gauge theory ( one containing no charged matter at all ) ?",
    "the gauge variables themselves can simulate matter that transforms according to the adjoint representation @xmath201 which is a faithful representation of @xmath202 , where @xmath203 denotes the center of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , by building composite fields and manipulating ancillas , we can simulate matter that transforms as the regular representation of @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 can be measured destructively for any representation @xmath33 of @xmath202 , or equivalently for any representation of @xmath6 that represents the center of @xmath6 trivially .",
    "we have seen that the nondemolition measurement of a non - abelian wilson loop is an example of an acausal measurement that can be made causal ( and in fact localizable ) if additional information is collected simultaneously .",
    "other examples were noted in @xcite .",
    "the causality problem arose for the nondemolition measurement of non - abelian wilson loops because multiplication of conjugacy classes is ill - defined . since this problem does not arise if @xmath6 is abelian",

    "the electron has been transmitted through the sctl far more rapidly than alice could send a light signal to bob .",
    "is such a device physically possible ?",
    "we can understand how the sctl works by characterizing it with a gauge - invariant unitary operator that it applies to a state . in our lattice formulation of an abelian lattice gauge theory with matter ,",
    "consider a connected path of links @xmath13 that begins at @xmath121 and ends at @xmath120 .",
    "associated with this path is the gauge - invariant operator @xmath262 acting on the weakly - coupled ground state of the theory , this operator creates a pair of equal and opposite charges at the sites @xmath120 and @xmath121 . acting on a state with a charged particle at site @xmath121 , it annihilates the particle at @xmath121 while creating a particle of like charge at @xmath120 , in effect transporting the particle from @xmath121 to @xmath120 .",
    "the applied operator factorizes as a product of gauge - invariant unitary operators @xmath210 , each acting on a single lattice link . therefore , many parties acting simultaneously , each manipulating only the link in her own vicinity , are able to operate the sctl .",
    "more physically , we can envision the operation of the sctl as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sawtooth ] .",
    "many parties are distributed along the sctl . at a pre - arranged time",
    ", each party creates an electron - positron pair . retaining the positron",
    ", she passes the electron to her right , while receiving an electron from the party on her left .",
    "then she brings electron and positron together to annihilate .",
    "claire , the party closest to alice , receives an electron from alice and annihilates it with claire s positron , while diane , the party closest to bob , hands her electron to bob .",
    "after all pairs annihilate , the sole remaining electron , initially in alice s hands , has been delivered to bob .",
    "the closer the parties are to one another , the faster the procedure can be completed .",
    "even though the charge transfer is virtually instantaneous , the gauss law is satisfied at all times .",
    "if we draw surfaces around alice and bob , then while the sctl is operating one unit of charge leaves alice s surface and one unit enters bob s .",
    "furthermore , even though the charge moves superluminally , the process does not violate causality , since no information is transmitted from alice to bob . indeed ,",
    "if felicity , a party in the middle of the sctl , were to disobey orders and fail to create an electron - positron pair , then felicity would `` intercept '' the charge sent by alice , and felicity s neighbor on the right would share a distantly separated electron - positron pair with bob .",
    "when bob receives the electron , all he learns is that his left neighbor has performed as expected , but he learns nothing about the activities of alice .",
    "while an abelian charge really carries no information , non - abelian charge is much more interesting  its orientation in a representation space can encode a message .",
    "thus it is easy to see that a non - abelian sctl , were one to exist , would violate causality . to be explicit ,",
    "consider the following protocol that enables bob to send classical information to alice ( based on ideas similar to those used to show that wilson loop measurement is acausal ) .",
    "first , alice produces a particle - antiparticle pair , where the particle transforms as representation @xmath33 of @xmath6 and the antiparticle as representation @xmath56 .",
    "the total charge of the pair is trivial .",
    "if @xmath263 denotes a basis for the representation @xmath33 , and @xmath264 denotes the conjugate basis for @xmath56 , then the singlet state prepared by alice is @xmath265 alice keeps the antiparticle , and sends the particle through the sctl to bob .",
    "bob has a loop of magnetic flux that he has prepared in the charge - zero state @xmath266 associated with conjugacy class @xmath22 of @xmath6 , as in eq .",
    "( [ chargezero_alpha ] ) . to convey a bit of information to alice , bob either does nothing to the charged particle he received from alice ( sending @xmath267 ) or lassoes it with his flux tube ( sending @xmath268 ) , and returns the charge through the sctl to alice .",
    "now if bob did nothing , alice recovers a singlet pair , but if bob lassoed the charge , then the state of the pair has become entangled with the state of bob s tube : @xmath269 alice then unites the particles and observes whether the pair annihilates . in the state eq .",
    "( [ lassoed_charge ] ) , the probability of annihilation is determined by the overlap of the pair s state with the singlet state , and is readily seen to be @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the character of class @xmath22 in representation @xmath33 .",
    "as long as the representation @xmath33 is not one - dimensional , the class @xmath22 can be chosen so that this probability is less than one",
    ". therefore , alice observes annihilation with certainty if bob sends 0 and observes annihilation with probability less than unity if bob sends 1  thus bob can signal alice .",
    "the capacity of the sctl is easily estimated .",
    "suppose that alice will signal bob by transmitting @xmath235 particles ( where @xmath235 is even ) each transforming as the representation @xmath33 or its conjugate representation @xmath56 .",
    "she can prepare and send a state of @xmath272 particles and @xmath272 antiparticles , in any one of @xmath273 distinct singlet states .",
    "these states are mutually orthogonal and in principle they can be readily distinguished by bob .",
    "therefore , alice is able to send @xmath274 bits to bob by using the sctl @xmath235 times . but the number of singlets is @xmath275 where @xmath276 grows no faster than a polynomial with @xmath235 .",
    "thus , asymptotically alice can send @xmath277 bits of information per transmission .",
    "this rate is just what we would have guessed naively , ignoring that observables must be gauge invariant .",
    "since the non - abelian sctl is acausal , it ought not to be physically realizable .",
    "what goes wrong if we try the same procedure that succeeded in the abelian case ?",
    "the trouble is that if claire produces a singlet pair , and diane does the same , then when claire s particle unites with diane s antiparticle , the charges might be unable to annihilate .",
    "in fact , if claire s particle transforms as the representation @xmath33 and diane s as @xmath56 , then the probability that the pair annihilates , determined by its overlap with the single state , is @xmath278 .",
    "thus , while in the abelian case the outcome of the procedure is that only a single electron survives , which is in bob s possession , in the non - abelian case many relic charges remain strewn along the path of the would - be sctl .",
    "though the procedure conserves charge , the orientation in the representation space of the charge that bob receives is actually uncorrelated with the orientation of the charge that alice sent , and no information is transmitted .",
    "finally , in the non - abelian theory as in the abelian theory , the operator that propagates a charged particle from @xmath121 to @xmath120 can be factorized as in eq .",
    "( [ openpathproduct ] ) into local factors .",
    "so why ca nt this operator be applied by many parties , each acting locally ? we must recall that the operators of the theory are not the group elements @xmath279 themselves , but rather the matrix elements @xmath280 of representations of the group . in the abelian case , the character of a product of group elements can be written as a product of characters , where each character is a unitary operator .",
    "but in the non - abelian case , the `` factorized '' operator is really a product of matrices .",
    "the contraction of indices in this matrix product can not be achieved by many parties acting locally ; rather it requires a nonlocal conspiracy .",
    "in the standard formulation of algebraic relativistic quantum field theory @xcite , an algebra of `` local '' operators on hilbert space is associated with each bounded open region of spacetime , such that two local operators commute if they are associated with regions that are spacelike separated .",
    "a local operator is designated as a `` local observable '' if it preserves the superselection sectors of the theory .",
    "one might be tempted to postulate that a quantum operation is physically possible in principle if and only if it can be expanded in terms of these local observables .",
    "we find this viewpoint untenable , because causality places more stringent constraints on the allowed operations @xcite .",
    "the problem of characterizing which quantum operations are compatible with causality is especially subtle , interesting , and physically relevant in relativistic quantum field theories with local gauge symmetry .",
    "one form of the question is : what operators can justifiably be called `` observables ? ''",
    "we have focused our attention on the measurability of the wilson loop because of its prominent place in the operator algebra of a gauge theory .",
    "the answer we have found is rather elaborate . in a gauge theory that includes charged matter that transforms faithfully , a _ destructive _ measurement of a spacelike wilson loop @xmath59",
    "is physically possible for any representation @xmath33 of the gauge group .",
    "the term `` destructive '' means that many cooperating parties acting together can ascertain the value of the wilson loop , but only by collecting additional information in the process , and at the price of damaging wilson loop eigenstates . in a pure gauge theory ( one with no charged matter ) , the destructive measurement of @xmath59 is possible for any @xmath33 that represents the center of the gauge group trivially .",
    "a nondemolition measurement of the wilson loop ( one that leaves wilson loop eigenstates intact ) is possible in an abelian gauge theory but not in a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "nondemolition measurement of a non - abelian wilson loop is impossible because it would conflict with relativistic causality .",
    "two distantly separated parties ( alice and bob ) , can each produce excitations locally ( magnetic flux tubes ) , preparing a state that is not an eigenstate of the wilson loop operator @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a loop that passes through both excitations . projecting onto a wilson loop eigenstate , whatever the outcome , entangles alice s excitation with bob s , modifying the excitations in a manner that either party can discern locally",
    ". such instantaneous preparation of quantum entanglement would enable spacelike - separated alice and bob to communicate .    in quantum field theory in general , and in gauge theories in particular",
    ", characterizing the physically allowed quantum operations seems to be an open problem .",
    "further progress on this question is bound to elucidate the physical content of relativistic quantum theory .",
