    "solitons - spatially localised and stable solutions of non - linear differential equations - are widely used in modelling physical and biological phenomena . in many of these applications ,",
    "it is also of interest to study the behaviour of small perturbations around the soliton . in the context of quantum field theory ,",
    "the small perturbations are interpreted as particles after quantisation @xcite . in that case , studying perturbations around a soliton amounts to studying the interaction of these ( quantum ) particles with the classical soliton . in skyrme",
    "s model for nuclei @xcite , for example , the solitons describe nuclei and the small perturbations correspond , after quantisation , to pions .",
    "their properties in the background of a skyrmion can therefore be interpreted in terms of pion - nucleus scattering .",
    "mathematically , studying perturbations of a soliton amounts to studying the spectral properties of the linear operator obtained by linearising the soliton equations around the soliton .",
    "it turns out that these spectral properties are often interesting , see @xcite for a textbook treatment of some examples .",
    "a particularly interesting example is provided by magnetic monopoles in @xmath0 yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory .",
    "it has long been known that the linearised ymh equations in the background of a monopole have interesting zero - modes in the bps limit @xcite and that they support infinitely many bound states @xcite .",
    "scattering of fermions off the monopole has also been studied extensively @xcite . however , fairly recently interesting new scattering phenomena were observed . in @xcite and , more recently and in more detail in @xcite , fodor and rcz studied spherically symmetric but non - linear perturbations of the t hooft - polyakov monopole , in the bps limit .",
    "the authors studied the evolution of such excitations numerically and found that the monopole holds on to a significant fraction of the energy from the initial excitation for a surprisingly long time .",
    "in particular the amplitude of the excitation decays as @xmath1 for late times .",
    "motivated by this work , forgcs and volkov carried out a perturbative analysis @xcite of the t hooft - polyakov monopole , still in the bps limit and preserving the hedgehog form of the monopole .",
    "their linearised equations of motion are a system of two weakly coupled , second order ordinary differential equations . by using the dispersion relation , one of these channels",
    "is seen to be massive and one massless .",
    "some intuition about the system is gained by artificially decoupling it and considering only the massive channel .",
    "the potential appearing in it has an ( attractive ) coulomb tail , so that it possesses infinitely many bound states approaching a critical value , beyond which there is a continuous spectrum . on re - coupling and",
    "considering the full system , a phase shift analysis of the massless channel shows that the infinity of bound states in the massive channel turn into an infinity of resonances in the coupled system .",
    "the energy held by the resonances leaks out slowly to the massless channel , leading to the long - lived excitation observed by fodor and rcz .",
    "the aim of this work is to extend the results of forgcs and volkov and to place it in the context of other spectral properties of the linearised ymh equations .",
    "we develop a quaternionic formalism for studying the linearised ymh equation in the case of vanishing higgs self - coupling ( i.e. in the bps limit ) .",
    "we show that this quaternionic formalism allows for a systematic treatment of perturbations , organised in terms of the eigenvalues of the generalised angular momentum operator ( combining orbital angular momentum , spin and isospin ) . for vanishing generalised angular momentum",
    "we recover the equations studied by forgcs and volkov but also find another system , consisting of two coupled , second order ordinary differential equations .",
    "these have bound states , already found by bais and troost in @xcite .",
    "the two systems found for vanishing generalised angular momentum thus already display a wealth of interesting spectral properties , including bound states at zero energy , bound states embedded in the continuum and resonance scattering .",
    "moreover , the bps condition allows one to map either of the systems into equivalent but sometimes simpler systems using a first order differential operator ( essentially a supersymmetry charge , but we do not consider the fully supersymmetric theory here ) .",
    "this turns out to explain some of the surprising features we find .",
    "we also consider the case of non - vanishing higgs self - coupling @xmath2 . in this regime ,",
    "our quaternionic formalism is no longer effective .",
    "thus we do not study general perturbations but instead focus on the generalisation of the system studied by forgcs and volkov when @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the coulomb tail in the massive channel is replaced by an attractive @xmath4 potential .",
    "this is strong enough to support infinitely many bound states after decoupling ( by hand ) , and our numerical analysis suggests that it will also produce infinitely many resonances in the coupled systems .",
    "we conclude that the qualitative features found by forgcs and volkov survive the `` switching on '' of @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .  2",
    ", we study the general form of the linearised ymh equation around a background which satisfies the first order bps equation ( which includes the t hooft - polyakov monopole in the bps limit ) .",
    "we introduce a quaternionic language and show that the linearised ymh equations for stationary time - dependent perturbations can be expressed as a quaternionic wave equation , supplemented by a background gauge condition . for non - zero kinetic energy there is a second , equivalent form of this wave equation , related to the original one by the application of a dirac - type operator .",
    "our strategy for studying the linearised ymh equations is therefore to study the quaternionic wave equation and to check if solutions satisfy the background gauge condition .    in sect .  3",
    ", we carry out a partial wave analysis of the quaternionic wave equation and derive two systems of two second order ordinary differential equations which arise in the sector with vanishing generalised angular momentum .",
    "we also derive the form of the alternative but equivalent systems obtained by acting with the dirac - type operator of the previous section .",
    "4 contains a detailed , numerical investigation of the two systems found in sect .",
    "even though these systems look superficially very similar , their spectral properties are quite different .",
    "one of the systems is the hedgehog system already discussed in @xcite ; we briefly repeat the analysis of this system , using it to set out our conventions .",
    "we then observe that the other system decouples , after application of the dirac - type operator , into one channel which supports bound states and another which only has scattering states .",
    "we are able to relate the bound states to those discussed in @xcite .",
    "the scattering states do not satisfy the background gauge condition and therefore are not valid bosonic states in the linearised theory , but we point out their relation to the fermionic scattering states studied in @xcite . in sect .  5 , we continue our study of @xmath0 monopoles , but allow for non - zero higgs self - coupling .",
    "we perturb around the background of the non - bps t hooft - polyakov monopole and find scattering resonances in the linearised hedgehog fields . finally , in sect .",

    "the linearised ymh equations in the background of a t hooft - polyakov monopole have very interesting spectral properties .",
    "we have seen that there is a zero - energy bound state and an infinity of coulomb bound states in the same energy region as an infinity of feshbach resonances . for vanishing total angular momentum ,",
    "there are two coupled systems which , despite their superficial similarity , have very different spectral properties : in one ( called the higgs system here ) there are infinitely many feshbach resonances , while in the other ( called the photon system here ) there are infinitely many true bound states , but no scattering states satisfying the background gauge condition and , in particular , no resonances .",
    "the occurrence of bound states can be understood in terms of a decoupling transformation .",
    "we also showed that the feshbach resonances in the higgs system persist when the higgs self - coupling @xmath2 is switched on .",
    "we saw that they become even more densely spaced , essentially because an attractive @xmath240 potential in the bps limit is replaced by an attractive @xmath4 potential when @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper we restricted attention to the frequency range @xmath241 and to spherically symmetric perturbations ( in the generalised sense ) . in this",
    "setting , the scattering is effectively single channel scattering , fully described by a single phase shift .",
    "when one goes beyond the threshold @xmath242 , the scattering will be genuine two - channel scattering , whose study is more involved , both numerically and in terms of the interpretation of the results .",
    "however , very similar multi - channel scattering problems are much studied in atomic and nuclear physics , and were considered in @xcite in the context of monopole scattering , so there is no problem in principle of carrying out a similar study here",
    ".    it would also be interesting to explore systems arising for larger eigenvalues of the generalised total angular momentum operator @xmath155 .",
    "the combination of our quaternionic formalism with the techniques developed in @xcite should provide an efficient method for finding the corresponding systems of coupled differential equations . as explained in sect .",
    "[ partialsect ] , we expect the system for @xmath183 to consist of ten equations , and for @xmath243 of twelve .",
    "however , a parity argument will split each of these system into two sub - systems ( as it did in our @xmath186 case ) , so that the largest system one needs to consider has six channels .",
    "to end , we point out the striking similarity between the spectral properties of the linearised ymh system in the background of the t hooft - polyakov monopole and those of the laplace operator on the moduli space of charge two @xmath0 monopoles @xcite . the latter also include zero - energy bound states , coulomb bound states embedded in the continuum and feshbach resonance scattering .",
    "these similarities are likely to have an interpretation in terms of electric - magnetic duality .",
    "spelling this out is left as the topic for a future investigation .",
    "a feshbach resonance @xcite is a resonance in a system consisting of several channels in which a bound state occurs if the coupling(s ) between the channels vanishes .",
    "feshbach resonances are much studied in the context atomic physics @xcite but also occur in other contexts , see @xcite for a pedagogical and recent account .",
    "consider a simple system consisting of two channels with coupling terms including , for convenience , a parameter @xmath244 , @xmath245 we can decouple the equations by setting the parameter @xmath149 to zero . with @xmath246 , suppose that the eigenvalue problem @xmath247 has bound states for @xmath248 , occurring at @xmath249 but that those values are part of the continuous spectrum for the other decoupled equation @xmath250 when the coupling parameter @xmath149 is non - zero , the bound states in can leak into the radiative channel and decay .",
    "when that happens , feshbach resonances in ( [ coupledgen ] ) generically occur at values close to @xmath251 .",
    "examples of such resonances are studied in @xcite and @xcite , both in the context of magnetic monopoles .",
    "a single channel eigenvalue problem such as ( [ decoupledgen ] ) is generally much easier to solve than a two channel coupled problem such as ( [ coupledgen ] ) .",
    "hence , it is worth looking at the bound state problem , as it gives an idea of where the resonances will occur . in systems where the coupling terms are weaker at large distances than the potential ,",
    "the decoupled problem is a good approximation . then these preliminary calculations mean that the region of searching for resonances is narrowed down , so that computational time is reduced ."
