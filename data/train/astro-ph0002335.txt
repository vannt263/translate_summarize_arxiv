    "deep radio surveys have proven to be one of the best methods for finding high redshift galaxies .",
    "most evidence suggests that these powerful radio sources are the precursors of local giant ellipticals ( e.g. pentericci , et al .",
    "many have irregular and complex morphologies suggestive of mergers and they are often surrounded by an overdensity of compact sources ; presumably sub - galactic clumps ( e.g. van breugel et al . 1998 ) . at both low and high redshifts ,",
    "radio galaxies usually have strong optical emission lines , especially oiii at 5007   .",
    "it is strongly debated , however , if the emission lines arise by the same mechanism as the radio jets .",
    "several authors ( e.g. rawlings & saunders 1992 , eales & rawlings 1993 , and evans 1998 ) have demonstated a strong correlation between radio luminosity and [ oiii ] luminosity , but as evans showed , there is a strong selection effect based on the detection limits as a function of distance and this may explain much of the correlation .",
    "since the galaxies are often disturbed , star formation , large scale shocks and a central agn are all possible sources of the line emission .",
    "active galaxy unification models suggest that radio galaxies are quasars with obscured broad line regions ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "eales & rawlings ( 1993 , 1996 ) and evans ( 1998 ) have been successful at using infrared spectrographs on 4-meter class telescopes to measure a few of the brightest lines in small samples of radio galaxies in the redshift range 2.2 to 2.6 and they find line ratios most consistent with seyfert 2 ( obscured agn ) nuclei .",
    "independent of our current efforts , a team has also successfully used the isaac instrument on the vlt to observe high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) including mrc  2025 - 218 ( mccarthy , personal communication ) .",
    "an additional unexplained phenomenon is that at high redshifts ( z@xmath40.6 ) the radio , optical continuum , infrared continuum and emission line structures tend to be closely aligned ( chambers , miley , & van bruegel 1987 , and mccarthy et al .",
    "this is probably not seen in lower redshift targets because the central activity tends to be a smaller fraction of the total luminosity than in high redshift sources . among the proposed explanations",
    "are that the emission lines arise from shock induced star formation ( de young 1989 , rees 1989 ) or that it is scattered light originating from the central nucleus ( fabian 1991 ) .",
    "this is a crucial question in our understanding of how and when most star formation occured in giant elliptical galaxies and in clusters in general .",
    "mrc  2025 - 218 ( z=2.630 ) has a compact near infrared and optical continuum morphology ( van breugel et al . 1998 ) , but extended ly@xmath1 emission ( 5@xmath5 ) aligned with its radio axis ( mccarthy et al .",
    "the extended uv emission has significant ( 8.3@xmath62.3 % ) linear polarization perpendicular to the uv axis ( cimatti et al . 1996 ) suggesting that scattering plays a significant role .",
    "mccarthy et al . also found three extremely red galaxies ( ero s : r - k @xmath4 6 mag ) within 20@xmath5 of the radio galaxy .",
    "this is a large overdensity of such objects and strongly suggests an association between the ero s and the active galaxy . in this paper",
    "we present infrared spectra taken with a long slit oriented close to the radio axis and including one of the ero s .",
    "the ero spectra will be described in a future paper .",
    "for all calculations we have assumed a cosmology with @xmath7=0 , q@xmath8=0.1 and h@xmath8=75 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 . for a redshift of 2.63",
    "this yields a luminosity distance of 2.1@xmath210@xmath10 mpc and an angular scale of 7.7 kpc per arcsecond .",
    "the field of mrc  2025 - 218 was observed on 4 jun , 1999 ( ut ) with the near infrared spectrograph nirspec ( mclean , et al .",
    "1998 and mclean , et al .",
    "2000 ) on the keck ii telescope during its commissioning .",
    "first the field was imaged in the k - band with the slitviewing camera which is a hgcdte picnic detector ( 256@xmath11 pixels ) sensitive from 1 to 2.5 microns .",
    "figure 1 shows the reduced image of the field with a total integration time of 540 seconds and a fwhm of 054 .",
    "as shown in the figure , the slit ( 42@xmath5 long and 057 wide ) was placed on both the radio galaxy and the extremely red galaxy dubbed ero - a by mccarthy et al .",
    "this corresponded to a slit position angle of -7 degrees .",
    "- k band image of the mrc 2025 - 218 field .    for spectroscopy ,",
    "the telescope was repeatedly moved roughly 20 arcseconds to center the objects first in the upper portion of the slit then the lower portion .",
    "four 300 second exposures were taken in both the h - band ( @xmath121.6@xmath13 m ) and k - band ( @xmath122.2@xmath13 m ) yielding an effective integration time on mrc  2025 - 215 of 20 minutes in each band . for guiding ,",
    "nirspec s optical guide camera was used to actively track a bright star roughly 2 arcminutes from mrc  2025 - 218 .",
    "arc lamp and flat lamp spectra were taken at each setting prior to changing mechanism setups .",
    "the 7.6 magnitude a0 star ppm  272233 was also observed at the same settings in order to remove telluric absorption effects from the atmosphere .",
    "the calibrator star was reduced first . for each band",
    "the spectral pair was subtracted and divided by a reduced flat field lamp spectra .",
    "bad pixels were then identified and removed by medianing the four nearest neighbors .",
    "the spectra were spatially rectified using a quadratic polynomial at each row , then spectrally rectified with a quadratic at each column .",
    "the negative spectrum of the star was then shifted and subtracted from the positive spectrum producing a combined spectrum with residual atmospheric lines removed .",
    "the stellar spectrum was extracted by averaging the central 3 pixels along the 2-d spectrum .",
    "a synthetic black body spectrum was divided into the stellar spectrum and residual hydrogen absorption lines from the brackett series were interpolated over .",
    "the spectra of the radio galaxy were reduced in a similar way except they were divided by the reduced calibration star spectrum instead of a black body . for extraction of the galaxy spectra , a 6 pixel spatial aperture ( 114 )",

    "nearby oh lines from the earth s atmosphere are labeled .",
    "the nuclear spectrum of the hzrg mrc  2025 - 218 is clearly dominated by emission lines from a central agn .",

    "this line width is very close to the mean h@xmath0 line width of 9870@xmath6950 km / s of radio loud quasars in the redshift range 2.0 to 2.5 by mcintosh et al . , 1999 .",
    "the ratio of [ oiii]/h@xmath0 is 17 which is also only seen in agn and ratios of [ nii]/h@xmath1 and [ oi]/h@xmath1 are also consistent with agn excitation ( osterbrock , 1989 ) .    from the h@xmath1/h@xmath0 narrow line ratio of 5.4 we derive an optical extinction a@xmath19=1.4 mag .",
    "in this calculation we ve assumed an intrinsic ratio of h@xmath1/h@xmath0 = 3.1 as seen in local agn ( osterbrock , 1989 ) , and the interstellar extinction law of cardelli et al .",
    "this must be treated as an upper limit , however , since radio loud objects may have elevated h@xmath1 due to collisional excitation ( e.g. baker et al .",
    "1994 ) . if the broad line ratio of h@xmath1/h@xmath0 were similar to the narrow line ratio , then broad h@xmath0 should have marginally been detected in our h - band spectrum .",
    "we therefore feel safe in the assumption that the extinction to the broad line region is similar to the value for the narrow line region ( 1.4 mag ) , but not necessarily significantly greater .",
    "this extinction is also sufficient to explain the lack of broad ly@xmath1 detections in mccarthy et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and villar - martin et al .",
    "( 1999b ) . without extinction",
    "our broad line emission would predict a ly@xmath1 broad line flux of 2.6@xmath210@xmath20  ergs  s@xmath9  @xmath17 in the villar - martin slit which would have been easily detected but with a@xmath19=1.4 mag this is reduced to less than 3@xmath210@xmath16 ergs  s@xmath9  @xmath17 which would have been marginably detected at best .",
    "- the k band spectrum of mrc 2025 - 218 is dominated by a very wide ( 9300 km s@xmath9 ) strong emission line of h@xmath1 .",
    "the upper graph is the reduced spectrum overlayed with the h@xmath1 profiles .",
    "the dashed line is the x - axis for this graph .",
    "the middle graph has had the continuum and h@xmath1 emission lines subtracted to emphasize the weaker lines of nii .",
    "the bottom graph is the residuals after subtracting gaussians for each emission line .    given the similarities in line width with radio loud quasars we now try to determine if the extinction could explain the observed differences between mrc  2025 - 218 and radio loud quasars .",
    "if we correct the h@xmath1 flux for a@xmath19=1.4 mag ( the upper limit to the narrow line extinction ) , then the broad line flux becomes 5.2@xmath210@xmath20 ergs  s@xmath9  @xmath17 or a broad line h@xmath1 luminosity of 2.6@xmath210@xmath3 ergs s@xmath9 .",
    "we used the sample of quasars of mcintosh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to derive a mean h@xmath1 luminosity of 6.11@xmath210@xmath3 ergs s@xmath9 based on the mean h@xmath0 equivalent width of their sample , no extinction and an intrinsic ratio of 3.1 between h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 .",
    "the one sigma dispersion in this value is only 10% in their sample .",
    "our extinction corrected h@xmath1",
    "luminosity is then weaker than their mean by a factor of 2.6 suggesting the central engines are very similar .",
    "if we go a step further and assume that the intrinsic luminosities are the same , then the broad line extinction would need to be a@xmath19=3.5 mag instead of a@xmath19=1.4 mag as derived above for the narrow line region .",
    "a remaining difference between mrc  2025 - 218 and the quasars in the mcintosh sample is the h - band magnitude .",
    "mrc  2025 - 218 has a broad band magnitude of h=19.1 while the mean quasar h - band magnitude is 15.16 . after correcting for the different redshifts ( quasar mean z=2.2 )",
    "then mrc  2025 - 218 is 3.2 magnitudes fainter than the quasars at a rest wavelength of 4550  .",
    "if the broad band flux of mrc  2025 - 218 is dominated by the agn then it would require a@xmath19=4.2  mag to make it equal to the quasar sample .",
    "this is surprisingly close to the value of 3.5 mag required to match the broad h@xmath1 fluxes .",
    "the assumption that the agn dominates the broad band flux in a radio galaxy , however , is not obvious and may be in conflict with the empirically determined k magnitude versus redshift relation observed in both low redshift and high redshift objects ( eales et al . 1997 ) .",
    "mrc  2025 - 218 is consistent with the k vs. z relation both with and without taking the line emission into account .",
    "villar - martin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find that mrc  2025 - 218 has large ratios of [ nv]/heii and [ nv]/[civ ] and suggest that the most likely explanation is that n is overabundant .",
    "they held out the possibility , however , that contamination from a broad line region was enhancing this line in comparison to their other radio galaxies .",
    "but they argued against this due to the lack of any broad lines including [ ciii ] . from our broad h@xmath1 detection ,",
    "however , we clearly see that the broad line region is only partially obscured and the strong nv emission is probably not indicative of high metalicity .",
    "this is further corroborated by the relatively low ratios of [ nii]/h@xmath1(narrow ) .",
    "the double spectral peak found in [ oiii ] could be due to a high velocity ( 200 km s@xmath9 ) cloud of gas or possibly a double active nucleus .",
    "the unsmoothed h@xmath1 narrow line is quite noisy but also shows a double profile with a separation of 200 km s@xmath9 . due to the noise",
    ", however , we are not confident in the second h@xmath1 peak .",
    "if the second peak were due to a star forming region it would be unlikely that the [ oiii ] line would be double as well since the oiii / h@xmath0 ratio should be much lower for a starburst .",
    "the off nucleus knots seen in [ oiii ] are difficult to understand .",
    "extended oiii has been observed in other radio galaxies aligned to the radio axis ( armus et al . 1998 ) but no line ratios have been determined for this gas .",
    "if we assume that the emission is from starbursts then our brightest knot ( 1@xmath210@xmath16 ergs s@xmath9 @xmath17 ) would have an [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratio less than 1.0 .",
    "this would make the h@xmath1 flux greater than 1@xmath210@xmath16  ergs  s@xmath9  @xmath17 and a luminosity more than 5@xmath210@xmath21 ergs s@xmath9 . assuming the relationship of kennicutt ( 1983 ) that the star formation rate is equal to l(h@xmath1 ) divided by 1.12@xmath22 ergs / s we derive a star formation rate of 45 m@xmath23 yr@xmath9 .",
    "this is comparable to the rates seen in pettini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) where they studied 5 star forming galaxies in the redshift range 2.2 to 3.3 .",
    "this is also close to the estimated star formation rate of the lyman break galaxy ms1512-cb58 .",
    "as calculated in teplitz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) cb58 has a sfr of 620 m@xmath23 yr@xmath9 but after removing a factor of 30 for gravitational lensing this becomes 21 m@xmath23 yr@xmath9 .",
    "we have obtained the most sensitive infrared spectra ever taken of a high redshift radio galaxy .",
    "the galaxy has very strong emission lines with ratios and line widths consistent with an obscured quasar .",
    "the narrow line region appears to be partially obscured with a@xmath19 around 1.4 mag , but from comparisons with high redshift quasars , we estimate that the extinction to the broad line region is between 3 and 5 magnitudes . since other radio galaxies in the same redshift range do nt show broad emission lines",
    ", we suggest that mrc  2025 - 218 is further along in its evolution towards an unobscured quasar .",
    "we can not rule out any of the proposed mechanisms for the production of the aligned emission . but based on the [ oiii ] line strength if the majority of the emission is due to star formation , we find that the star formation rate is comparable to that of lyman break galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "we urge even deeper observations of this and other similar radio galaxies in order to measure additional extended line emission .",
