    "fig : temp_map ] and fig .",

    "fig : pressure ] ) .",
    "this is particularly interesting as it implies that the thermal pressure of the blobs is higher than the thermal pressure of the surrounding ambient gas .",
    "this finding , however , does not necessarily mean that the blobs are out of pressure equilibrium with the ambient gas as the latter may have extra non - thermal pressure ( for example , magnetic fields and/or relativistic electrons ejected from the central agn ) .",
    "although at the moment it is not clear which physical processes may be responsible for the formation of the observed substructures , we can safely state that the system is dynamically unstable and the presence of blobs is likely to be a transient phenomenon .",
    "we notice that the evolution of the system strongly depends on the total pressure supporting the ambient gas .",
    "below we discuss two extreme possibilities :    \\1 ) the ambient gas surrounding the blobs is only supported by thermal pressure and thus the blobs are actually not in pressure equilibrium ;    \\2 ) the ambient gas , and possibly to some extent the blobs too , are supported by an extra non thermal pressure component such that the blobs and the ambient gas are actually in pressure equilibrium .    in the first case",
    ", the blobs are overpressured so we expect them to expand .",
    "the expansion time is of the order of the blob s sound crossing time : @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the radius of the blob , and @xmath10 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 are the mean particle weight , the proton mass and the adiabatic index , respectively .",
    "using the linear dimension of the blobs reported in table  3 we find @xmath193  yr , which appears to be very short compared with the likely cluster age .",
    "furthermore , the blobs cooling time is @xmath194 times longer than the dynamical time ( see lower panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : pressure ] ) .",
    "thus , in this first case in which the external gas is not supported by an extra pressure component , the blobs should expand before their excess pressure is radiated away .",
    "consequently we do not expect to have a significant mass deposition into a cold phase from the blobs .",
    "conversely , if the blobs are both in thermal and pressure equilibrium with the ambient gas , as in the second case considered above , the blobs are likely to be more stable .",
    "nevertheless , as the blobs are heavier than the ambient gas ( they have higher densities ) , they are expected to sink eventually toward the minimum of the potential well .",
    "the time scale @xmath195 needed by the blobs to reach the cluster center is obviously @xmath196 just in the extreme case in which we assume that both the gas is collisionless and the blob have zero angular momentum .",
    "] , where @xmath197 is the free fall time .",
    "if we assume the cluster potential well is described by a nfw profile ( navarro , frenk & white , 1996 ) the free fall time for a point mass at rest at a radius @xmath198 can be well approximated by : @xmath199 where @xmath200 , is the scale radius , @xmath201 , @xmath202 is the newton s constant , @xmath203 is the critical density for closure , and @xmath204 is the characteristic density contrast . using the best fit nfw parameters for our cluster and @xmath205  kpc we find : @xmath206 from table  3 we see that the free fall and the cooling times are similar , thus the actual sinking time is much longer than the cooling time .",
    "therefore , unlike the first case considered above , if the ambient gas is supported by an extra non thermal pressure component such that the gas and the blobs are in pressure equilibrium , we expect the blobs to cool down before they can actually sink into cluster center .",
    "hence , some mass deposition into a cold phase is possible .",
    "we conclude this section by discussing possible dynamical models that may explain the origin of the observed complex structure in the core of a .",
    "our starting point is the evidence for the presence of a dense gas core that moves from north to south , with a mach number @xmath207 ( see  [ par : nature ] ) .",
    "we propose two models : + i ) the motion of the cool core induces instabilities that penetrate inside the core and disturb the gas , + ii ) the central galaxy has an intermittent agn which makes the cool gas `` bubbling '' . + the features observed in the cluster result from the development of hydrodynamic instabilities induced by these two phenomena .",
    "below we discuss in detail these two models .",
    "we conclude that both models are consistent with the available data and that further observations are required to discriminate between the two cases .",
    "we first show that small - scale structure can be the result of hydrodynamic instabilities induced by the observed motion of the core gas ( revealed by the presence of the cold front .",
    "this motion may be due to a merger ( as in a2142 or a3667 , markevitch et al .  2000 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001 ) , or due to the gas sloshing as in many other cooling flow clusters ( markevitch et al.2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "the precise nature of the core motion is not important .",
    "the orientation of the front ( see e.g. fig.[fig : percentile ] ) , together with the asymmetry in the temperature distribution ( see fig.[fig : temp_map ] ) , suggests that the core is moving along a projected direction that goes from north to south .",
    "if the core is in fact a merging subcluster , it is clear that in projection the position of the subcluster is very close to the cluster center ( see  [ par : core ] ) , from the available data , however , we can not measure the merger impact parameter .",
    "hence , the subcluster may in fact be passing through the cluster at any distance along the line of sight from the center .",
    "when a dense gas cloud is moving with respect to a rarefied one , the interface between the two gasses is subject to hydrodynamical rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) and kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instabilities . in the following we estimate the effect of both instabilities on the moving core using the same approach as vikhlinin & markevitch ( 2002 ) .",
    "we assume that the gas cloud is a sphere of radius equal to the distance of the observed front , @xmath208@xmath21  ( @xmath209  kpc ) .",
    "as the cloud moves , the external gas flows around its border .",
    "the inflowing gas slows down at the leading edge of the sphere but reaccelerates at larger angles as it is squeezed to the sides by new portion of inflowing gas . in the case of an incompressible",
    "fluid , the velocity at the surface of the sphere is purely tangential and is given by @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the velocity of the inflowing gas at infinity and @xmath212 is the angle of the considered point on the cloud with respect to its direction of motion ( see e.g. lamb 1945 ) .",
    "unfortunately there is no analytic solution for the flow of a compressible fluid around a sphere .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative picture is similar .",
    "as we are only interested in order of magnitude estimates , in the following we parametrize the actual fluid speed introducing the parameter @xmath213 so that : @xmath214 the parameter @xmath213 should range between 1 ( fluid velocity at the surface of the sphere equal to the inflowing gas at infinity ) and 1.5 ( incompressible fluid ) .    first we consider the r - t instability .",
    "this instability develops only if the acceleration induced by the drag force @xmath215 is greater than the gravitational potential acceleration near the front due to the cluster mass inside the moving cloud .",
    "if we assume hydrostatic equilibrium , then the gravitational acceleration is given by : @xmath216 where , @xmath217 is the mean particle mass , and @xmath65 and @xmath70 are the gas electron density and temperature profiles , respectively . in our case",
    "this gives @xmath218  cm  s@xmath33 ( see  [ par : front ] ,  [ par : tprofile_ns ] , and fig .  [",
    "fig : cold_front ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the cloud acceleration due to the drag force is given @xmath219 ( where @xmath220,@xmath221 the gas electron density inside and outside the edge ) which in our case gives @xmath222  cm  s@xmath33 .",
    "as the drag acceleration is less than the gravitational one , then the r - t instabilities should be suppressed .",
    "now we consider the k - h instability .",
    "this instability may develop whenever two fluids in contact have a non - zero tangential velocity .",
    "as for the r - t instability , the presence of a gravitational field may suppress the development of the instability .",
    "the stability condition is such that a perturbation with wavenumber less than @xmath223 is stable if : @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the gravitational acceleration at the interface between the two regions and @xmath226 is the density contrast . using the eq .",
    "[ eq : v ] for the tangential velocity , eq .",
    "[ eq : stab ] becomes : @xmath227 eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda ] shows that gravity suppresses instabilities only on scales larger than @xmath228  kpc .",
    "hence , in absence of other stabilizing mechanism , we expect the formation of the k - h instabilities on smaller scales .    in the case of a",
    ", we see the instabilities on scales of the order of the radius of the sphere @xmath229 may develop already at @xmath230 . the condition that the instability on the gas cloud scale can develop , although necessary is not sufficient . in fact",
    ", in order to effectively disrupt the gas of the moving gas cloud , the growth time @xmath231 of the instability must be much shorter than the dynamical time of the system ( the cluster crossing time , @xmath232 ) .",
    "we thus require ( see vikhlinin , markevitch , & murray 2001b , and algebraic correction of mazzotta et al .",
    "2002 ) : @xmath233 if we assume that the cluster radius is @xmath234  mpc , at the angle at which the instability starts to develop of @xmath235 , we find that @xmath236 .",
    "furthermore , at the much larger angle of @xmath237 , where the instabilities are most effective , we find @xmath238 . therefore , they have sufficient time to grow to the non - linear regime .",
    "the effect of k - h instabilities is to turbulently mix the gas in the dense moving cool cloud with the more diffuse hotter cluster gas . in particular some less dense gas from the cluster",
    "could be deposited into the denser gas cloud and vice - versa .",
    "such a process may be responsible for the formation of the observed x - ray clumpy structure .",
    "similarly , any pre - existing cold ( @xmath239  k ) gas deposited in the cluster and/or sub - cluster core by a cooling flow will also be mixed and re - distributed on these scales .",
    "this would explain the observed h@xmath6[nii ] emission morphology .",
    "on the other hand , these sub - sonic k - h instabilities will not produce any significant radio signature .",
    "hence , in this scenario the radio properties of a   ( the mini - halo and the x - ray holes ) must be related to activity of the central galaxy .    in conclusion ,",
    "the observed x - ray properties of the a   core may be produced by k - h instabilities induced by the motion of the core .",
    "the observed structure of a   can also be accounted for if the central cluster galaxy hosts an agn that undergoes intervals of strong activity followed by periods of relative quiescence ( e.g. binney & tabor 1995 , soker et al .",
    "2000 ) . during each active period",
    ", the agn inflates two bubbles by filling them with relativistic electrons . as observed in other clusters ( e.g. perseus , fabian et al .",
    "2000 ; hydra a , mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ; abell 2052 , blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) , this expansion creates an external shell where the gas is denser .",
    "the bubbles rise buoyantly , entrain the dense gas underneath them and induce convection ( e.g. , churazov et al .",
    "these bubbles are also subjected to hydrodynamic instabilities that destroy them , fragmenting the denser shell into what we observe as denser x - ray blobs .",
    "the observed structure in the core may be created by numerous bursts of agn activity during which the jets point in different directions .",
    "we can visualize this process as `` gas bubbling '' induced by the energy injection from a central agn .",
    "the difference from other clusters with similar x - ray cavities but lacking such filamentary or blobby structure might be caused by a shorter duty cycle of the central agn in a , of the order of @xmath240  yr ( see  [ par : dis_blobs ] ) .",
    "the relativistic electrons produced by the agn that are likely to be present inside the non - thermal bubbles ( see e.g. mcnamara 2002 and references therein ) should eventually distribute in the central cluster region .",
    "however , they may avoid the densest gas blobs due to , for example , an enhanced magnetic field created during the shell compression induced by the bubble expansion . these electrons would add a non - thermal pressure component in the ambient ( inter - blob ) gas that may account for the apparent pressure nonequilibrium of the cluster core .    as discussed in ",
    "[ par : dis_blobs ] , in this case the dense x - ray blobs have time to cool , depositing some mass in a cold phase .",
    "this cool gas may explain the presence of the observed co and h@xmath6[nii ] extended emission in the cluster center ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] ) .",
    "the relativistic electrons produced by the agn may also account for the presence of the mini radio halo observed in the cluster core ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : percentile ] ) .",
    "we finally mention that there may be a connection between the agn activity and the core sloshing , hinted at by the observed correlation between the presence of the x - ray bubbles and cold fronts in the central regions of many cooling flow clusters ( markevitch et al .",
    "reynolds , heinz & begelman ( 2002 ) showed that during an agn jet formation , a spherical pulse forms and propagates at the sound speed into the intracluster medium .",
    "repeated agn activity may inject sufficient kinetic energy to produce sloshing of the gas , although it is unclear how the bulk motion of the core as a whole could be produced .",
    "sloshing of the dense core may also be induced by a merger , even if the merging subcluster did not reach the center of the main cluster ( e.g. , churazov et al .",
    "2003 ) .    to conclude this section , `` gas bubbling '' induced by central agn provides a plausible explanation of the observed features in the cluster core",
    "the poor cluster a   has several remarkable features that are only detectable with the superb resolution of _",
    "chandra_. first , there is a cold front indicating a mildly sub - sonic gas motion .",
    "second , two x - ray cavities that may be associated with steep spectrum radio emission indicating previous radio activity in this system .",
    "third , a number of small dense gas blobs in the cluster core that may be the shreds of a cooling core disturbed either by k - h instabilities or `` bubbling '' induced by intermittent agn activity .",
    "all of these properties relate to processes that may act to disrupt or destroy any cooling flow ( sub - cluster merger , injection of non - thermal electrons into the intracluster medium or direct radiation from an agn ) . from this relatively short x - ray observation",
    "it is not possible to determine which process ( if any ) dominates .",
    "future deeper observations in the x - ray , radio and optical of a   may allow the energetics of each to be assessed . when combined with observations of other similar clusters , it will be possible draw concrete conclusions about the astrophysical nature of cooling flows .",
