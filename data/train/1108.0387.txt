    "in recent years a plethora of nlo qcd calculations have been presented in the literature .",
    "high - energy experiments , notably at the lhc , have and will be benefited by the progress in our computational ability to deal with higher order corrections to scattering amplitudes with many partons involved . in order though to get the optimum benefit and to produce predictions that can be directly compared to experimental data at the hadron level , a matching with parton showers and hadronization is ultimately inevitable .    according to the literature ,",
    "two methods exist that deal with the matching of parton showers ( ps ) to matrix element ( me ) calculations at nlo accuracy , mc@nlo  @xcite and powheg @xcite . at the same time",
    ", several computational frameworks for nlo qcd calculations have emerged . in constructing a general interface of ps to me computations with nlo accuracy ,",
    "we have chosen to combine the powheg and helac - nlo  @xcite approach , respectively .",
    "the first application of our project was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this letter we continue our investigation and validation of such an interface by studying higgs boson production in association with a t@xmath0  pair .",
    "there are several reasons to perform this work . on the phenomenological side , there is still interest to use this channel to search for higgs boson in the low mass regime  @xcite . on the theoretical side , the appearance of recently developed tools as implemented in ` amc@nlo",
    "`  @xcite , also used in the analysis of higgs boson production in association with a t@xmath0  pair , offers a unique opportunity for cross - checking and validating our computations and the corresponding computer programs .",
    "we performed our calculations using the ` powheg - box `  @xcite , a flexible computer framework implementing the powheg method , already used in the study of different processes also by other authors ( among the others , the most recent applications include ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this work",
    "the following ingredients were requested and provided to ` powheg - box `  as input :    * the flavor structures of the born ( gg@xmath6 ht@xmath0 , q@xmath7@xmath6 ht@xmath0 , @xmath7q@xmath6 ht@xmath0 ) and real radiation emission ( q@xmath7@xmath6 ht@xmath0 g , gg@xmath6 ht@xmath0 g , @xmath7g@xmath6 ht@xmath0@xmath7 , g@xmath7@xmath6 ht@xmath0@xmath7 , @xmath7q@xmath6 ht@xmath0 g , qg@xmath6 ht@xmath0q , gq@xmath6 ht@xmath0q ) subprocesses ( q@xmath8\\{u , d , c , s , b } ) were specified . *",
    "the born - level phase space was obtained by using the invariant mass of the t@xmath0  quark pair and four angles .",
    "* squared me s with all incoming momenta for the born and the real - emission processes were built using amplitudes computed by ` helac - oneloop `  @xcite , on the basis of skeleton structures generated by this same program and ` helac - phegas `  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the me s in the physical channels were obtained by crossing .",
    "* color structures for building the color - correlated born amplitudes were taken from ` helac - dipoles `  @xcite . *",
    "spin - correlated born amplitudes were projected from the helicity basis to the lorentz one by using the polarization vectors . * ` helac - oneloop `  was also used for computing the finite part of the virtual correction contributions in dimensional regularization , on the basis of the opp method  @xcite complemented by feynman rules for the computation of the qcd @xmath9 rational terms  @xcite .    with this input ` powheg - box `",
    "was used to generate events at the born level plus first radiation , stored in les houches event files ( lhef )  @xcite .",
    "then , one can choose any shower monte carlo ( smc ) program for generating events with hadrons , just by showering the previous ones and applying hadronization and decay models ( it is worth mentioning that ` powheg - box `  was written in the effort of being shower detail independent ) .",
    "we worked with both the ` pythia `  @xcite and ` herwig `  @xcite smc generators .    in the ` powheg - box `",
    "the first emission is the hardest one measured by transverse momentum which is also the ordering variable in ` pythia ` .",
    "however , if the ordering variable in the shower is different from this one , such as in ` herwig ` , the hardest emission can be different from the first one .",
    "in such cases , in order to face this issue , ` herwig `  is constrained to discard shower evolutions ( vetoed shower ) with larger transverse momentum in all splittings occuring after the first emission , that is computed by ` powheg - box `  .",
    "in addition , a truncated shower , simulating wide - angle soft emission before the hardest emission , is in principle also needed for powheg matching  @xcite , but its effect turned out to be small  @xcite .",
    "as there is no implementation of truncated shower in ` herwig `   using external lhef , the effect of the truncated shower is absent from our predictions .",
    "the born and the real me s were tested in randomly chosen phase - space points against results from ` helac - phegas `  . the consistency among real emission , born , color - correlated and spin - correlated me s was tested in randomly chosen real - emission phase - space regions , by examining the ratio between the real - emission amplitudes in soft and collinear limits and the corresponding subtraction terms , automatically computed by ` powheg - box `  as approaching the related singularities .",
    "the process presented here was studied extensively at the nlo accuracy in the literature  @xcite , which enabled us to make detailed checks of our calculation .",

    "@xcite for different renormalization scale choices @xcite , and in all cases we found agreement up to 56 digits .",
    "we then compared the cross - sections at the nloaccuracy to the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite . at this purpose",
    ", we used the ` mrst2002nlo `  @xcite pdf set , provided by ` lhapdf `  @xcite , with a 2-loop running @xmath11 , 5 light flavours and @xmath12 , and the following parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales were chosen equal to @xmath16 , where @xmath16 was varied in the @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 interval , with default scale being @xmath19 .",
    "the calculations were performed at the planned lhc energy of @xmath20 .",
    "the results of this comparison are presented in table  [ tab : nlocomp1tth ] , showing agreement .",
    "we also made a comparison to the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite , using the ` cteq5 m ` pdf set from ` lhapdf ` , a 2-loop running @xmath11 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 as given above , and again found agreement within their quoted uncertainty .    finally , we also compared differential distributions from events already including first radiation emission with the nlo  predictions of ref  @xcite .",
    "we found agreement for all distributions presented in that paper .",
    "as examples , we show in fig.[fig : distcomp_tth ] the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the higgs boson in the tevatron setup  .",
    "in interfacing nlo calculations to smc programs we mainly aim at estimating the effects of showers and hadronization , therefore , we analyzed the events at two different stages of evolution :    * * decay : * starting from the events collected in lhef produced by ` powheg - helac ` , we just included on - shell decays of t - quarks and the higgs boson , as implemented in ` pythia ` , and further decays of their decay products , like charged leptons ( the @xmath24 is assumed to be unstable ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , turning off any shower and hadronization effect . * * full smc : * decays , showering evolution and hadronization have been included in our simulations , using both ` pythia `  and ` herwig ` .    in both smc setup muons ( default in `",
    "pythia ` ) and neutral pions were assumed as stable particles . all other particles and hadrons",
    "were allowed to be stable or to decay according to the default implementation of each smc .",
    "quark and higgs masses , as well as @xmath25 , @xmath26 masses and total decay widths , were tuned to the same values in ` pythia `  and ` herwig ` . on the other hand ,",
    "each of the two codes was allowed to compute autonomously partial branching fractions in different decay channels for all unstable particles and hadrons .",
    "multiparticle interaction effects were neglected ( default in ` herwig `  ) .",
    "additionally , the intrinsic @xmath27 spreading of valence partons in incoming hadrons in ` herwig `  was assumed to be 2.5 gev . considering this setup , we found agreement between ` pythia `  and ` herwig `  predictions within 5% , except in bins where the statistics is very small . beside the conceptual differences in the parton shower and hadronization algorithms between the two smc generators , written on the basis of different theoretical ideas ( @xmath28 vs. angular ordering , string model vs. cluster hadronization and preconfinement ) , a possible origin of this overall small discrepancy",
    "is the absence of the truncated shower in the ` herwig `  prediction .",
    "unfortunately , however , as already mentioned , we can not check the last point within the ` powheg - box `  framework . in any case , the modest entity of the discrepancy means that the effect of the truncated shower , not included in our analysis , is small .",
    "further explanations of small discrepancies can also be related to the different decay channel scheme and branching fractions in the two smc codes .    in our computation",
    ", we adopted the following parameters : @xmath29 , ` cteq6.6 m ` pdf set from ` lhapdf ` , with a 2-loop running @xmath11 , 5 light flavours and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath13 , @xmath32 .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales were chosen equal to @xmath19 .",
    "we decided to switch on all possible decay channels of the higgs boson , implemented in the smc programs .",
    "we used the last version of the smc codes : ` pythia `  6.425 and ` herwig `  6.520 .",
    "we studied the effect of the full smc by comparing distributions at the decay and smc level .",
    "as the number of particles is very different at the end of the two stages , we first made such a comparison without any selection cut , in order to avoid the introduction of any bias .",
    "this way the cross - section at all levels is indeed exactly the same .",
    "we found @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 fb ( here and in all following @xmath37 predictions the quoted uncertainties are the statistical ones only ) .",
    "as an illustrative example , we present the distributions of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the hardest jet , @xmath38  and @xmath39 , in fig.[fig : ptj ] and fig.[fig : yj ] , respectively . the jets are reconstructed through the @xmath40 algorithm with @xmath41 , by using ` fastjet `  2.4.3 @xcite .",
    "one can observe a rather significant softening in the transverse momentum spectrum as going from results at the decay level to full smc ones . on the other hand",
    ", the effect of the shower on the rapidity of the hardest jet is almost negligible and rather homogeneous .",
    "we distinguished several classes of jets including final state emissions , according to their origin : jets that can be traced back to ( i ) first radiation emissions , ( ii ) the decay products of the higgs boson , ( iii ) the decay products of the top and antitop quarks , ( iv ) a mixing of the previous ones .",
    "in particular , main contributions to the @xmath38spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptj ] are due to jets of the ( iv ) and ( iii ) class . as for the @xmath39 distribution ,",
    "the tails are dominated by jets of the ( iv ) , ( i ) and ( iii ) classes .        , as for the rapidity of the hardest jet . ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite the invariant mass , @xmath42 , and the separation in the rapidity  azimuthal - angle plane of the two hardest lowest - lying b - hadrons , @xmath43 , were studied , by choosing a dynamical scale for the generation of the hard - scattering events and by taking into account only the h @xmath44 b@xmath45  decay channel .",
    "besides computing all @xmath27 distributions already presented in that paper , always finding agreement , we also computed the aforementioned b - hadron distributions reproducing the same simulation setup and without applying any cut , considering only the h @xmath44",
    "b@xmath45  decay channel , as well as all channels . in the former , we found agreement with the predictions of ref .",
    "the effect of the remaining channels , not studied in that work , produces an increase in the region below 80gev in the @xmath42 spectrum and only for large @xmath43 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mbb ] and  [ fig : drbb ] .",
    "pairs of b - hadrons both including quarks that can be traced back to higgs decays only populate the region of the @xmath42 spectrum below @xmath46 .",
    "the region above @xmath46 is instead dominated by pairs with at least one b - hadron that can be traced back to a ( anti)top decay .",
    "b@xmath45   channel ( dashed line ) , were computed by interfacing ` powheg - helac `  to both ` pythia `  ( solid line ) and ` herwig `  ( dash - dotted line ) . ]    , as for the azimuth - rapidity distance correlations of the two hardest lowest - lying b hadrons . ]    the effects of the decay and shower also depend on the selection cuts . while the typical selection cuts include both leptons and hadrons , we started with a restricted set , not involving any leptonic cut , in particular as for the number of leptons .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that this number can be quite different at the decay and shower level , as the shower produce many secondary leptons .",
    "thus , coming back to our setup , we considered and implemented cuts only on jet variables : ( i ) @xmath47 and ( ii ) @xmath48 for all jets , ( iii ) @xmath49 in each event .",
    "we show the distribution of the scalar sum of all transverse momenta in the event , @xmath50  in fig.[fig : ht ] .",
    "we can see that the spectrum becomes softer due to showering effects , with respect to the one computed at the decay level , as can be understood on the basis of ps physics .",
    "the same is true and even more evident if one singles out the hadronic component of @xmath50 , as well ( not shown ) .        on the other hand , the effects of the shower on the ( anti-)lepton transverse momentum , @xmath51 , and the missing transverse momentum , @xmath52 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ptl ] and  [ fig : ptmiss ] , are small and rather uniform , except for a significant increase for small values , which is due to secondary leptons produced in the shower .    , as for the transverse momentum of all antileptons . ]    , as for the total missing transverse momentum . ]    the cross - sections at the decay and at the smc level , after the hadronic cuts listed above , amount to @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath35",
    "@xmath55 fb , @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath35 @xmath55 fb and @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath35 @xmath55 fb .",
    "in this section we present predictions for ht@xmath0  production with parton shower and hadronization effects at lhc .",
    "in addition to the jet cuts ( i  iii ) mentioned above , we also applied selection cuts on the leptonic variables : ( iv ) we focused on the dileptonic channel , asking for exactly one @xmath60 and one @xmath61 with ( v ) @xmath62 and ( vi ) @xmath63 , whereas the transverse missing energy of the event was constrained to ( vii ) @xmath64 .    in fig.[fig : mjj ] we present the distribution of the invariant mass of all jet pairs . here",
    "the effect of the shower is again quite significant . in particular",
    ", there is a small bump around the higgs mass , as already noticed in the literature  @xcite , visible in the data at the decay level , which is completely washed out when ps is included .",
    "the same is true for the invariant mass distribution of the two hardest jets ( not shown ) .",
    "the cross - section after cuts , at the smc level , were found to be @xmath56 @xmath65 @xmath35 @xmath66 fb and @xmath58 @xmath67 @xmath35 @xmath68 fb .",
    "one of the biggest differences in the results produced by ` pythia `   and ` herwig `  interfaced to the ` powheg - box`noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the study of a different process was the observation that ` herwig `  gives rise to hard jets more central than ` pythia ` .",
    "we observe the same trend in our results , but by far to a lesser extent . in particular , in the bins around zero rapidity",
    "the ratio between the rapidity distributions of ` powheg - helac `  + ` herwig `  and ` powheg - helac `  + ` pythia `  found in our study amounts to maximum 1.05 , both in case of the hardest and the second hardest jet . on the other hand ,",
    "the agreement between the two smc , as for the rapidity distributions of leptons and antileptons , was found to be even closer .",
    "we would like to conclude this letter by emphasizing that interfacing nlo calculations , as structured in helac - nlo , with ps and hadronization effects , within the powheg framework , open the exciting possibility of realistic , precise and reliable simulations of pp hard - scattering collisions , leading to multiparticle production , up to the hadron level , as detected in the accelerator experiments .",
    "we have presented predictions for the signal , pp @xmath6 t@xmath0h production , illustrating their consistency with existing calculations , as well as the phenomenological potential of our approach .",
    "a thorough analysis , including the most important backgrounds , notably pp @xmath6 t@xmath0b@xmath45 , within the same framework , is in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
