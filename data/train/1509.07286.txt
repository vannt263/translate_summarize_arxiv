    "the exclusive production of simple final states in ultrarelativistic upc of heavy ions is a special class of nuclear reactions @xcite . at high energies and due to large charges of colliding nuclei ( gold - gold or lead - lead collisions )",
    "there are two categories of the underlying reaction mechanisms .",
    "first is the photon - photon fusion @xcite and the second is double photoproduction @xcite .",
    "we evaluated for the first time differential distributions for exclusive production of two @xmath2 mesons ( four charged pions ) in the double scattering ( photon - pomeron ) process @xcite for rhic and lhc .",
    "the results will be compared with the contribution of two - photon mechanism .",
    "the analysis includes a smearing of @xmath1 mass using a parametrization of the alice collaboration @xcite .",

    "photon emitted from a nucleus fluctuates into hadronic or quark - antiquark components and converts into an on - shell meson .",
    "the cross section for this mechanism can be written differentially in the impact parameter @xmath4 ( distance between two colliding nuclei ) and in the vector meson rapidity @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 is the probability density for producing a vector meson at rapidity @xmath5 for fixed impact parameter @xmath4 of the heavy ion collision .",
    "each probability is the convolution of the @xmath8 cross section and a flux of equivalent photon @xmath9 where @xmath10 is usually written as a function of the impact parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the photon flux is expressed through nuclear form factor @xmath11 which is related to charge distribution in the nucleus .",
    "details of different form factors and their application to nuclear calculation can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . to calculate the @xmath12 cross section we use a sequence of equations which are presented in @xcite .",
    "constants for the underlying @xmath13 cross section are obtained from a fit to hera data @xcite .",

    "returning to formula for single vector meson production ( eq . [ eq : sigma_single ] ) , this expression depends on the running @xmath1 meson mass . in our calculation",
    "we use the alice parametrization @xcite which is the most appropriate for the lhc data ( a comparison of the zeus , star and alice parameters for relativistic breit - wigner and continuum amplitudes was shown during a talk at the eds blois workshop and can be found in @xcite ) .",
