    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics contains a number of parameters whose values are not predicted by theory and must therefore be measured by experiment . in the quark sector , the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite govern the weak transitions between quark flavours , and precision measurements of their values are desirable . in particular , much experimental and theoretical effort is currently being employed to test the consistency of the unitarity triangle relevant to the decays of @xmath0 mesons , which arises from the ckm formalism .",
    "the angle @xmath14 , characterising indirect @xmath15 violation in @xmath16 transitions , is now known to a precision of less than 4% @xcite .",
    "this makes a precision measurement of the length of the side of the unitarity triangle opposite to @xmath14 particularly important as a consistency check of the sm picture .",
    "the length of this side is determined to good approximation by the ratio of the magnitudes of two ckm matrix elements , @xmath17 .",
    "both of these can be measured using exclusive semileptonic @xmath0 meson decays . using charmed semileptonic decays ,",
    "the precision to which @xmath18 has been determined is of order 1.5% . on the other hand @xmath19 , which can be measured using charmless semileptonic decays ,",
    "is poorly known by comparison .",
    "both inclusive and exclusive methods of measuring @xmath19 have been pursued , with the inclusive methods giving values approaching 5% precision .",
    "the exclusive determination of @xmath19 currently has a precision closer to 10% .",
    "it is the aim of an ongoing programme of measurements at the @xmath0 factories to improve this precision to better than 5% , for comparison with the inclusive results , which have somewhat different experimental and theoretical systematics , and to provide a sharp consistency test with the value of @xmath14 .",
    "measurements of branching fractions for exclusive  decays , where @xmath20 denotes a light meson containing a @xmath21 quark , have been reported by the cleo  @xcite , babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite collaborations .",
    "a recent compilation of these results has been made by the heavy flavour averaging group ( hfag ) @xcite . in these measurements ,",
    "three methods of identifying signal candidates have been employed , denoted `` untagged '' , `` semileptonic tagged '' or `` full reconstruction tagged '' .",
    "the most precise measurements at the present time come from untagged analyses @xcite @xcite . as more integrated luminosity is accumulated by the @xmath0-factory experiments , full reconstruction tagging techniques to identify candidate @xmath0 mesons ,",
    "against which the signal @xmath0 mesons recoil , will become the most precise method .",
    "these techniques hold the advantage of providing the best signal to background ratio , offset by the lowest efficiencies . in this paper",
    "we present preliminary studies of the exclusive semileptonic decays , , ,  and  using such a full reconstruction tagging technique .",
    "the data sample used for this analysis contains 657 @xmath22 pairs , collected with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath23 ( 3.5 on 8  gev ) collider  @xcite .",
    "kekb operates at the @xmath12 resonance ( @xmath24  gev ) with a peak luminosity that exceeds @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath12 is produced with a lorentz boost of @xmath26 nearly along the electron beamline ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a super - conducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath28 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two inner detector configurations were used . a 2.0 cm beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector",
    "was used for the first sample of 152 @xmath11 pairs , while a 1.5 cm beampipe , a 4-layer silicon detector and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 505 @xmath29 pairs@xcite .      in this analysis",
    "we fully reconstruct one of the two @xmath0 mesons from the @xmath12 decay ( ) in one of the following hadronic decay modes , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath37 . within these @xmath0 decay modes ,",

    "following selection of the most likely  candidate , events with  satisfying the tighter selection criteria @xmath63 and @xmath64 are retained .",

    "photons identified with isolated ecl clusters which have a laboratory energy of less than 50 mev are ignored .",
    "electrons are identified using information on @xmath65 from the cdc , response of the acc , position matching between the reconstructed track and an ecl cluster , the ecl shower shape and the ratio of the energy deposited in the ecl to the momentum determined from tracking .",
    "the signals in the klm are used to identify muons .",
    "charged kaons are identified based on the @xmath65 information from the cdc , the cherenkov light yields in the acc and time - of - flight information from the tof counters . any charged particles which are not identified as leptons or kaons",
    "are taken to be pions .",
    "photons whose direction in the laboratory frame lies within a @xmath66 cone of the direction of an identified electron or positron are considered to be bremsstrahlung .",
    "the 4-momentum of the photon is added to that of the lepton and the photon is not considered further .",

    "is identified amongst the recoil particles , the candidate with the highest momentum in the @xmath12 rest frame is chosen .    to isolate signal candidates ,",
    "several requirements are placed on the recoil system .",
    "there must be one lepton candidate present only .",
    "the total charge of the recoil system , @xmath80 , is required to be @xmath81 if a neutral tag has been identified , and @xmath82 if a charged tag has been identified . in the charged case",
    ", the sign of @xmath80 must be opposite to that of @xmath83 . in the neutral case",
    ", we do not make any requirement on the sign of the lepton charge with respect to the , to allow for mixing .",
    "the number of charged recoil particles is required to correspond to one of the sought signal modes , i.e. one for  ( the lepton ) , two for  and  ( the lepton plus one charged pion ) and three for  and  ( the lepton plus two charged pions ) .",
    "additionally , the number of recoil @xmath69 candidates is required to be consistent with one of the sought modes . in order to increase efficiency , however , we allow more than the necessary number in some cases : we require no @xmath69 candidates to be present for  and  modes , and at least one @xmath69 for the  and  modes , and exactly one @xmath69 for the  mode .",
    "additionally , we require that there be no more than @xmath84 of residual neutral energy present on the recoil side , calculated in the @xmath12 rest frame , after any photons contributing to the @xmath20 candidate have been removed .",
    "if the tagging @xmath0 is correctly reconstructed and the correct lepton and hadron candidate have been identified on the recoil side , then ideally all missing 4-momentum is due to the remaining unidentified neutrino .",
    "signal events can therefore identified by examining the missing mass squared ( 2 ) , defined to be the square of the missing 4-momentum . in signal events",
    "this quantity should be close to zero , and applying this requirement provides a very strong discrimination between signal and background . in practice",
    "we construct the recoiling @xmath0 meson to have its nominal energy and magnitude of momentum in the @xmath12 rest frame , and direction opposite to . the missing 4-momentum vector of the decaying recoil @xmath0 system is then obtained by subtracting the 4-momenta of the hadron candidate and lepton from the @xmath0 4-momentum .    for signal candidates , the neutrino 4-momentum is defined to be @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the missing 3-momentum vector of the recoil @xmath0 system defined as above .",
    "the kinematical variable , defined to be the invariant mass squared of the lepton - neutrino system , can then be determined .",
    "the  resolution obtained using this procedure is excellent , varying from @xmath87 for the  channel to @xmath88 for the  channel .",
    "background contributions come from several sources .",
    "these include semileptonic decays resulting from  transitions , denoted , which have significantly larger branching fractions than the channels under study ; continuum @xmath89 processes ; and cross feed from one  channel into another .",
    "the contributions of these backgrounds are studied using monte carlo ( mc ) simulated data samples generated with the evtgen package @xcite .",
    "generic and continuum mc samples equivalent to approximately three times the integrated luminosity of the real data set are used .",
    "the model adopted for  and  decays is based on hqet and parametrisation of the form factors @xcite , while decays are based on the isgw2 model @xcite . a non - resonant @xmath90 component based on the goity - roberts prescription @xcite",
    "is also included .",
    "a separate mc sample equivalent to approximately sixteen times the integrated luminosity of the real data set is used to simulate the signal channels and crossfeed from other  decays .",
    "models for the exclusive modes are based on light cone sum rules ( lcsr ) for @xmath91 @xcite , @xmath70 and @xmath75 @xcite modes and isgw2 @xcite for other exclusive modes .",
    "radiative effects associated with the lepton and resulting from higher - order qed processes are modelled in all mc samples using the photos package @xcite .",
    "all generated mc events are passed through a full simulation of belle detector effects based on geant 3.21 @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain the signal yields , a fit is performed to the observed 2  distributions , individually for each mode .",
    "the fits are made in three separate bins of  in order to obtain the yields as a function of , and to minimise the systematic error which arises from the lack of precise knowledge of the shape of the form factors in  decays .",
    "the  bins are chosen commensurate with available statistics , and are @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and greater than @xmath94 .",
    "the components of any given fit are signal ,  crossfeed and the contribution from other backgrounds , which is dominated by decays .",
    "the shapes of the components are taken from mc and the normalizations are fit parameters .",
    "the fitting method follows that of barlow and beeston @xcite and takes into account finite mc statistics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mm2fit ] the observed 2  distributions for the five decay modes are shown , summed over the three  bins .",
    "the fit components shown in the figures are likewise those obtained by summing the results of the fits in the individual  bins .",
    "the fitted event yields obtained in this way are @xmath95 for the  mode , @xmath96 for , @xmath97 for , @xmath98 for  and @xmath99 for .      [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      table  [ table : systsum ] summarises the preliminary result of a study of the contributions to the total systematic error for the branching fractions summed over the three  bins , for each of the  signal modes .",
    "these are broken down into the following categories ; those arising from detector simulation , such as charged track reconstruction efficiency , particle identification and neutral cluster reconstruction ; uncertainties in the luminosity ; and effects of the form factor models used and assumed branching fractions in the mc .",
    "the detector simulation errors have been obtained following the procedure described in a belle study of similar final states in reference  @xcite .",
    "the effects of model dependence of the form factor shapes assumed in the  mc used for signal efficiency and crossfeed background estimates have been studied by comparing the fitted yields obtained using the default model implemented in the mc , which is lcsr @xcite , and the isgw2 model @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by reweighting the mc events on an event - by - event basis based on their generated values of and angular variables .",
    "the variation between these two models in predicting the shapes of the  distributions for the pseudoscalar and vector modes typifies the spread between available models for the dynamics of these decays .",
    "the shapes of the background 2  components used in the fits can be affected by the assumed branching fractions of dominantly contributing  and  decays in the mc samples used .",
    "this was studied by varying in turn the , , , , , , ,  and branching fractions by their measurement errors as quoted by the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "a reweighting technique is again used , and fitted yields with and without reweighting are compared .",
    "the maximum observed spread in the fitted branching fraction is assigned as systematic error .",
    "the effects of finite mc statistics are taken into account in the fitting procedure @xcite and are reflected in the errors on the obtained branching fractions .",
    "since the available mc samples are rather limited in statistics , variations of the assumptions on form factor shapes and normalizations can be absorbed by the present fits to a significant extent .",
