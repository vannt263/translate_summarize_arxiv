    "the electrodynamics of low - dimensional multiband systems in which strong correlations responsible for formation of localized electronic states coexist with correlations responsible for charge - density - wave ordering ( cdw ) still attract great attention .",

    "are related to one wide band , while magnetic anomalies are associated with more or less localized states in two narrow bands .",
    "the relations between the mid - infrared ( mir ) energy scales , measured at temperatures below the critical cdw temperature , the activation energies of transport coefficients and the related effective numbers of conduction electrons are not entirely clear @xcite . in order to explain these relations in simple physical terms",
    ", one needs , in the first place , a precise description of the cdw coherence effects in the quarter - filled wide band .",
    "this problem that is still not completely solved for the single - band case is in the focus of this work .",
    "the previous theoretical work @xcite on the electrodynamics of the single - band cdw systems followed two basic routes .",
    "first , the collective contributions have been studied to explain the low- and zero - temperature properties of the incommensurate cdw systems , with the emphasis on the non - linear conductivity regime @xcite .",
    "the main controversies characterizing early theoretical investigations are resolved using accurate symmetry analyses , with a particular care devoted to the local field effects @xcite .",
    "the principal physical problem in these analyses is that the coupling between infrared - active collective modes and external electromagnetic fields is shown as a simple function of the single - particle ( interband ) polarizability @xcite , which implies the indirect electron - mediated , rather than the direct , photon - phase phonon coupling .",
    "the high ( mir ) frequency analyses @xcite , on the other hand , were focussed on the precise description of the single - particle excitations , in particular on the rigorous treatment of the square - root singularity in the optical conductivity spectra at @xmath1 .",
    "it is shown that the controversies related to the high - frequency optical spectra usually reflect the incorrect treatment of the diamagnetic current in the transverse response approaches , and , consequently , can be easily avoided using the longitudinal response theory @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we consider a quarter - filled single - band cdw system and a related tetramerized metallic system in which all non - retarded short - range interactions are neglected , and all coherence effects in the correlation functions associated with the retarded , phonon - mediated interations are treated exactly through the known analytical form of the current vertices and the inverse effective - mass tensor . using this exactly solvable model , we reexamine several textbook results @xcite for the dc and optical conductivity of commensurate cdw systems .",
    "the analysis is however limited by the use of several approximations .",
    "we consider a holstein - like electron - phonon coupling in which the coupling constant is independent of the electron wave vectors .",
    "being interested in the optical conductivity spectra obtained by the reflectivity measurements , which are characterized by a relatively poor resolution in the low - frequency part of the spectra , we approximate the total optical conductivity by the sum of the collective and single - particle contributions , with the local field effects included only in the collective term . in the numerical analysis of the single - particle term , we consider the simplest case in which two relaxation rates are assumed to be independent of frequency and temperature",
    ". finally , the commensurability ( umklapp ) effects are present in the model through the shift of the phase phonon frequency to a finite value and through the commensurate photon - phonon coupling ( see sec .  5 ) .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , the band dispersions of the tetramerized cdw case are briefly discussed . in secs .  3 and 4.1",
    ", we consider the electron - hole excitations in the two - band version of the model in which the umklapp effects are neglected .",
    "the emphasis is on the clear identification of the effectively free and effectively bound charge carriers in the underdamped regime ( the interband damping energy is small in comparison with the cdw gap ) , their relation to both the activation energy of dc conductivity and the mir scale in the optical conductivity .",
    "the brief discussion of the optical conductivity spectra in the overdamped regime , tentatively related to the hybridizations / interactions with localized electronic states , is given in sec .",

    "5 , the infrared selection rules for the collective modes in the commensurate cdw systems are discussed in some detail .",

    "the other phonon modes are taken into account later in sec .  3 , and are treated on the same footing with the static disorder .",
    "the cdw instability of the quarter - filled q1d electronic systems in the case in which the disorder is absent and the electron - phonon coupling @xmath18 is independent of the electron wave vectors is described by the well - known textbook expressions ( see eqs .",
