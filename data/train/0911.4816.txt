    "many complex systems in nature exhibit a rich structure of dynamics , described by a mixture of different stochastic processes on various time scales .",
    "it has become common to call such dynamical processes with time scale separation _ superstatistical _",
    "a fascinating feature is that many highly nonlinear equations , for example the navier - stokes equations , do effectively produce stochastic processes that can be very well approximated by linear stochastic differential equations with fluctuating parameters on a large time scale , i.e. , superstatistical processes .",
    "examples where superstatistical techniques have proved to be a powerful tool are lagrangian trajectories of tracer particles in fully developed turbulence @xcite , share price dynamics with volatility fluctuations @xcite , atmospheric and geophysical processes @xcite , random matrix theory @xcite and random networks @xcite .",
    "the basic idea underlying most of these models is that locally the system is described by a simple gaussian stochastic process , and only on a large scale the mixture of various gaussian processes with fluctuating variance leads to more complex behavior .",
    "so far the superstatistical model building has mainly concentrated on reproducing the correct stationary density of the nonlinear system under consideration .",
    "however , it is certainly important to incorporate dynamical information from the set of all higher - order correlation functions .",
    "in fact , experimentalists are often able to measure two relevant quantities , the stationary probability distribution of a fluctuating time series produced by the complex system under consideration , and the two - point correlation function for relatively small time scale differences .",
    "the purpose of this article is to describe how to construct the optimum superstatistical model for a given complex system taking these two experimentally measured quantities as input . as a main example",
    ", we will construct a suitable superstatistical model for measured velocity time series in turbulent taylor - couette flow , which is in excellent agreement with the experimental data .",
    "our techniques presented here are quite generally applicable to large classes of complex systems where the local dynamics is well approximated by a generalised langevin equation with memory kernel .",
    "we start from a simple example that will be subsequently generalised .",
    "consider locally a linear stochastic differential equation ( without memory kernel ) of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are constants and @xmath3 is gaussian white noise .",
    "this generates the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , a gaussian markov process , with stationary distribution @xmath4 and correlation function @xmath5 : @xmath6 @xmath7 denotes an ensemble average . in the superstatistical approach , one regards the parameter @xmath2 as a random variable that fluctuates on a large time scale .",
    "if this random variable has the probability distribution @xmath8 , then the stationary ( marginal ) distribution of the complex system under consideration is given by @xmath9 all kinds of distributions @xmath10 can be generated in this way , for example power - law decays in @xmath11 or stretched exponentials , depending on the properties of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "in fact , an experimentally measured @xmath10 can be used to construct @xmath8 from eq .",
    "( [ here ] ) .",
    "the superstatistical correlation function is given by @xmath12 clearly , an experimentalist may ask whether such a simple model is appropriate for a given experimental data set . in most cases it will not , because the measured decay of the correlation function is not simply given by @xmath13 as is the case for the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "in fact , experimental data often show local correlation functions that are well described by a sum or difference of two exponentials , or sometimes there is oscillating behavior .",
    "our aim in the following is thus to extend the local dynamics in such a way that this more refined local dynamics , reproducing the correct ( measured ) correlation function , can be incorporated into the superstatistical modelling approach .",
    "a more general starting point is to consider locally a set of coupled linear stochastic differential equations @xmath14 the elements of the matrix @xmath15 and the vector @xmath16 are constants .",
    "the noise terms are denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the idea of the theory of mori - zwanzig @xcite is that some of the variables @xmath18 are irrelevant , or inaccessible to the experimentalist . by eliminating these variables out of the equations of motion ,",
    "one ends up with a set of _ non - markovian _ equations in the relevant variables only . in this article",
    "we study in detail a 2-dimensional version of this problem , namely @xmath19 here , @xmath20 and @xmath1 are positive constants .",
    "the constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 can have either sign .",
    "@xmath3 denotes gaussian white noise , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for the above dynamics , the two eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath15 are @xmath25 , with @xmath26 it is easy to see that the real parts of these eigenvalues are always positive provided @xmath27 . in the remaining part of this article",
    ", we assume that this inequality holds .",
    "this insures that the system will locally reach a stationary state @xcite .",
    "our physical interpretation is as follows : the velocity variable @xmath28 decays with relaxation constant @xmath1 and is subjected to two forces : a rapidly fluctuating force @xmath3 that drives the dynamics and another force @xmath29 that decays with relaxation constant @xmath20 .",
    "this force @xmath29 , however , is not independent of the velocity @xmath28 .",
    "rather , the change of @xmath29 is proportional to the velocity @xmath28 , with proportionality constant @xmath22 .",
    "the above linear coupling scheme is one of the simplest , but non - trivial , examples of coupled local dynamics between pairs of variables .",
    "now assume that an experimentalist can only measure one of these two variables .",
    "we chose @xmath28 to be this variable and proceed by eliminating @xmath29 out of the set of equations  ( [ exlan1],[exlan2 ] ) . in this way",
    "one obtains an equation in @xmath28 with a memory kernel @xcite : @xmath30 to obtain this formula , we ignored the contribution @xmath31 because this term is unimportant for long times .",
    "expression ( [ gle_af ] ) contains an exponential memory kernel and is known in the literature as the generalised langevin equation @xcite .",
    "usually , one assumes that the time dependence of the memory kernel and the correlation function of the stochastic term are equal .",
    "this equality is called the fluctuation - dissipation relation of the second kind @xcite and the stochastic term @xmath3 is then interpreted as internal noise . however , for the example studied in the present paper , the aforementioned time dependencies are not equal . then , the stochastic term @xmath3 is interpreted as external noise . such noise terms have also been studied recently in the context of stochastic resonance @xcite and anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "two well - known special cases are included in our local model . taking the limit @xmath32 in  ( [ gle_af ] ) results in the standard langevin equation  ( [ lan_stan ] ) without memory kernel .",
    "equivalently , this case also arises by putting @xmath33 , i.e.  no coupling between velocity and force .",
    "moreover , expressions  ( [ exlan1],[exlan2 ] ) reduce to the equations of motion of a brownian harmonic oscillator for @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the variables @xmath28 and @xmath36 are then interpreted as the velocity and the position of the oscillator , respectively .",
    "before implementing superstatistics , we first have to solve the above local model .",
    "let us start with calculating the local stationary distribution @xmath4 of the relevant variable @xmath28 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation @xcite for the joint probability distribution @xmath37 is @xmath38p(v , v , t).\\ ] ] the stationary distribution @xmath39 is obtained by setting @xmath40 and is given by @xmath41\\right].\\ ] ] for the marginal distribution @xmath4 we integrate out the dependence on @xmath42 @xmath43 where the parameter @xmath2 is given by @xmath44 we see , as required for superstatistics , that the local stationary distribution is a gaussian distribution .",
    "( colour online ) plot of the correlation function for different values of @xmath22 .",
    "the solid line is a representation of expression  ( [ bzero ] ) , i.e.  the case @xmath45 .",
    "the dashed - dotted curve shows an oscillatory behavior  ( [ osc ] ) .",
    "the dashed and dotted curve are respectively a sum and difference of two exponential functions  ( [ sum_diff]).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to proceed further into a dynamical setting , we have to calculate a formal solution for @xmath28 .",
    "let us denote the laplace transform @xmath46 of a function @xmath47 by @xmath48 from eqs .",
    "( [ exlan1],[exlan2 ] ) one obtains @xmath49 as @xmath50,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath51 is @xmath52 ( see  ( [ ab ] ) for the definition of @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) . by calculating the inverse laplace transform of  ( [ fourvw ] ) , one obtains @xmath55 the stationary correlation function @xmath5 is obtained by evaluating the ensemble average of the product of @xmath28 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "all the terms involving the initial conditions @xmath58 and @xmath59 that contribute to @xmath5 are vanishing for @xmath57 and in this limit one ends up with the following expression for the correlation function : @xmath60 in order to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath5 , we have to calculate the inverse laplace transform of @xmath51 given by ( [ varp ] ) .",
    "the result of this transformation depends on whether @xmath45 or @xmath61 .",
    "however it is easy to prove that the following inequalities hold : @xmath62 given @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath27 .",
    "this means that the laplace transform is well - defined provided that the latter inequalities are satisfied . under the assumption that @xmath45 , one obtains the following expression for the function @xmath65 @xmath66e^{-at},\\ ] ] while for the case @xmath61 the result is @xmath67 we proceed by evaluating  ( [ defcorr ] ) to calculate an explicit expression for the correlation function . under the assumption that @xmath45 , one obtains @xmath68.\\ ] ] we split the case @xmath61 into two subcases , depending on whether @xmath54 is imaginary or real . in case @xmath61 and @xmath69 ,",

    "this means that the parameter @xmath22 determines whether one ends up with a sum or a difference of exponentials in expression  ( [ sum_diff ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "there are @xmath76 qualitatively different types of correlation functions contained in the set of stochastic differential equations  ( [ exlan1],[exlan2 ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig ] .",
    "the figure shows the correlation function for @xmath76 different values of the coupling parameter @xmath22 but with constant values of the other parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "our chosen example values of @xmath22 are @xmath79 ( solid line ) , @xmath80 ( dashed - dotted line ) , @xmath81 ( dashed line ) and @xmath82 ( dotted line ) . experimentally measured correlation functions in turbulence are often of strikingly similar shape ,",
    "see for example figure  2a in @xcite .",
    "finally let us apply superstatistics to this local model by introducing large - scale fluctuations in @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ kappa_stat ] ) , is distributed according to some probability density @xmath8 and that the changes of @xmath2 occur on a time scale that is much larger than the relaxation time of the correlation function @xmath5 .",
    "generally , this results in a superstatistical distribution @xmath10 given by ( [ here ] ) that is non - gaussian .",
    "the time - dependence of the superstatistical correlation function @xmath83 given by ( [ fbcv ] ) is equal to the time - dependence of @xmath5 as long as the @xmath2-fluctuations are produced by fluctuations of @xmath21 only .",
    "we are now in a position to formulate the central result of this article .",
    "let a complex system be given that exhibits time scale separation and superstatistical behavior ( see @xcite for a test ) .",
    "suppose we know @xmath10 and @xmath84 from experimental measurements .",
    "how should we construct the optimum synthetic superstatistical model that is consistent with the measured data ?",
    "of course many nonlinear models are possible , but if one assumes that there is a local linear coupling between pairs of dynamical variables and that locally the stochastic process considered exhibits gaussian behavior , then the model  ( [ exlan1],[exlan2 ] ) with superstatistical parameter fluctuations is the most appropriate one .",
    "the distribution @xmath8 of the parameter @xmath2 can be determined by comparing eq .",
    "( [ here ] ) with the experimentally measured distribution @xmath10 .",
    "then , depending on the shape of the measured correlation function , the values of the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath20 and @xmath22 can be determined .",
    "( colour online ) plot of the measured distribution @xmath10 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the dashed line represents a gaussian approximation @xmath86 for @xmath10 .",
    "the solid line is the superstatistical distribution  ( [ here ] ) , with @xmath8 a lognormal distribution  ( [ poi]).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to illustrate our general method , we study as an example time series obtained in an experiment performed by lewis and swinney @xcite . the data set contains the values of a single velocity component @xmath28 as a function of time @xmath87 in turbulent taylor - couette flow for reynolds number @xmath88 .",
    "the stationary probability distribution @xmath10 exhibits non - gaussian behavior , see figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "a suitable choice for @xmath8 , motivated by the k62 theory of turbulence @xcite , is a lognormal distribution @xmath89 choosing @xmath90 and @xmath91 one obtains an excellent fit of the experimentally measured histogram , see figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "but there are of course many different stochastic processes generating the same stationary distribution @xmath10",
    ". we can now construct a more precise synthetic model of the dynamics by taking into account the information contained in the measured correlation function .",
    "the experimentally measured correlation function @xmath92 is shown in figure  [ fig3]a , together with a single exponential function @xmath93 and a sum of two exponentials , see expression  ( [ sum_diff ] ) with @xmath94 .",
    "figure  [ fig3]a clearly shows that a single exponential function is not able to properly fit the measured correlation function , while a sum of two exponentials yields an excellent fit .",
    "this means that our superstatistical memory - kernel approach is a suitable way to model these data .    in this paper",
    ", we did not consider the @xmath2-process .",
    "that is to say , we did not construct an explicit model for the time development of the slowly varying variable @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is clear that for very long time scales the details of this process will influence the correlation function @xmath92 and the stationary distribution @xmath10 . to investigate the behaviour for",
    "larger time scales @xmath95 , fig .",
    "[ fig3]b shows the measured and modelled correlation function in a double - logarithmic plot , which emphasizes the long - time behaviour .",
    "we see that our model ( solid line ) fits the measured data well up to time scales @xmath96 . beyond that , there are large statistical fluctuations and the behaviour is dominated by details of the @xmath2-process .",
    "for example , an asymptotic power law decay could be constructed by considering a @xmath2-process whose long - term correlations decay with a power law . taking",
    "the @xmath2-process into account goes beyond the scope of the current paper but is an interesting topic for further research .",
    "our current approach as presented in this paper gives testable predictions for small and intermediate time scales @xmath95 .",
    "the asymptotic @xmath97 behaviour is then dominated by the chosen @xmath2-process .",
    "let us emphasise that obtaining a sum ( and not a difference ) of two exponentials for the correlation function  ( [ sum_diff ] ) is non - trivial .",
    "for this it is crucial that @xmath98 and as a consequence @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "to summarise , in this article we have shown how to construct an optimum superstatistical dynamical model that exhibits the same invariant density and correlation function as an experimentally measured time series extracted from a complex system . the relevant universality class of complex systems to which our approach is applicable consists of systems where locally pairs of dynamical variables are coupled in the simplest possible ( linear ) way , as described by eqs .",
