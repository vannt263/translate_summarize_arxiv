    "the study of in - medium properties of hadrons is important for the understanding of strong interaction physics .",
    "the study of in - medium hadron properties has relevance in heavy - ion collision experiments as well as in astro - physics .",
    "there have been also extensive experimental efforts for the study of in - medium hadron properties by nuclear collision experiments . in these heavy - ion collision experiments ,",
    "hot and dense matter is produced . by studying the experimental observables one can infer about how the hadron properties are modified in the medium . for example",
    ", the observed enhanced dilepton spectra @xcite could be a signature of medium modifications of the vector mesons @xcite .",
    "similarly the properties of the kaons and antikaons have been studied experimentally by kaos collaboration and the production of kaons and antikaons in the heavy - ion collisions and their collective flow are directly related to the medium modifications of their spectral functions @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons properties will be of direct relevance for the upcoming experiment at fair , gsi , where one expects to produce matter at high densities and moderate temperatures @xcite . at such high densities ,",
    "the properties of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons produced in these experiments are expected to be modified which should reflect in experimental observables like their production and propagation in the hot and dense medium .",
    "the reason for an expected appreciable modifications of the @xmath0 and @xmath8 mesons is that @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons contain a light quark ( u , d ) or light antiquark .",
    "this light quark or antiquark interacts with the nuclear medium and leads to the modifications of @xmath0 and @xmath1 properties . the experimental signature for this can be their production ratio and also in - medium @xmath9 suppression @xcite . in heavy - ion collision experiments of much higher collision energies , for example",
    "in rhic or lhc , it is suggested that the @xmath9 suppression is because of the formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "however , in ref . @xcite it is observed that the effect of hadron absorption of @xmath9 is not negligible .",
    "due to the reduction in the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in the medium it is a possibility that excited charmonium states can decay to @xmath5 pairs @xcite instead of decaying to lowest charmonium state @xmath9 .",
    "actually higher charmonium states are considered as major source of @xmath9 @xcite . even at certain higher densities ,",
    "it can become a possibility that the @xmath9 itself will decay to @xmath5 pairs .",
    "so this can be an explanation of the observed @xmath9 suppression by na50 collaboration at @xmath10 gev / nucleon in the pb - pb collisions @xcite .",
    "the excited states of charmonium also undergo mass drop in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the modifications of the in - medium masses of @xmath0 mesons is large then the @xmath9 mass modification @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath9 is made of heavy quarks and these interact with the nuclear medium through gluon condensates .",
    "the change in gluon condensates with the nuclear density is very small and hence leads to small modification of @xmath9 mass .",
    "the in - medium modifications of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons has been studied in various approaches .",
    "for example , in the qcd sum rule approach , it is suggested that the light quark or antiquark of @xmath11 mesons interacts with the light quark condensate leading to the medium modification of the @xmath12 meson masses @xcite .",
    "the quark meson coupling model ( qmc ) has also been used to study the d - meson properties @xcite . in the qmc model",
    "the scalar @xmath2 meson couples to the confined light quark ( u , d ) in the nucleon thus giving a drop of the nucleon mass in the medium .",
    "the drop in the mass of @xmath0 mesons arises due to the interaction with the nuclear medium and the mass drop of d mesons observed in the qmc model turns out to be similar to that calculated in the qcd sum rule approach .    in the present investigation",
    "we study the properties of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in the isospin - asymmetric hot nuclear matter .",
    "these modifications arise due to their interactions with the nucleons , the non - strange scalar isoscalar meson @xmath2 and the scalar isovector meson @xmath3 .",
    "the medium modifications of the light hadrons ( nucleons and scalar mesons ) are described by using a chiral @xmath13 model @xcite .",
    "the model has been used to study finite nuclei , the nuclear matter properties , the in - medium properties of the vector mesons @xcite as well as to investigate the optical potentials of kaons and antikaons in nuclear matter @xcite and in hyperonic matter in @xcite .",
    "for the study of the properties @xmath0 mesons in isospin - asymmetric medium at finite temperatures , the chiral su(3 ) model is generalized to @xmath14 flavor symmetry to obtain the interactions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons with the light hadrons .",
    "the @xmath0 meson properties in symmetric hot nuclear matter using the chiral effective model have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and for the case of asymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature in @xcite . in a coupled channel approach for the study of d mesons ,",
    "using a separable potential , it was shown that the resonance @xmath15 is generated dynamically in the i=0 channel @xcite analogous to @xmath16 in the coupled channel approach for the @xmath17 interaction @xcite .",
    "the approach has been generalized to study the spectral density of the d - mesons at finite temperatures and densities @xcite , taking into account the modifications of the nucleons in the medium .",
    "the results of this investigation seem to indicate a dominant increase in the width of the d - meson whereas there is only a very small change in the d - meson mass in the medium @xcite",
    ". however , these calculations @xcite , assume the interaction to be su(3 ) symmetric in u , d , c quarks and ignore channels with charmed hadrons with strangeness .",
    "a coupled channel approach for the study of d - mesons has been developed based on su(4 ) symmetry @xcite to construct the effective interaction between pseudoscalar mesons in a 16-plet with baryons in 20-plet representation through exchange of vector mesons and with ksfr condition @xcite .",
    "this model @xcite has been modified in aspects like regularization method and has been used to study dn interactions in ref .",
    "this reproduces the resonance @xmath15 in the i=0 channel and in addition generates another resonance in the i=1 channel at around 2770 mev .",
    "these calculations have been generalized to finite temperatures @xcite accounting for the in - medium modifications of the nucleons in a walecka type @xmath18 model , to study the @xmath0 and @xmath8 properties @xcite in the hot and dense hadronic matter . at the nuclear matter density and for zero temperature , these resonances ( @xmath15 and @xmath19 ) are generated @xmath20 mev and @xmath21 mev below their free space positions .",
    "however at finite temperature , e.g. , at @xmath22 mev resonance positions shift to @xmath23 mev and @xmath24 mev for @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) respectively .",
    "thus at finite temperature resonances are seen to move closer to their free space values .",
    "this is because of the reduction of pauli blocking factor arising due to the fact that fermi surface is smeared out with temperature . for @xmath1 mesons in coupled channel approach a small repulsive mass shift",
    "is obtained .",
    "this will rule out of any possibility of charmed mesic nuclei @xcite suggested in the qmc model @xcite .",
    "but as we shall see in our investigation , we obtain a small attractive mass shift for @xmath1 mesons which can give rise to the possibility of the formation of charmed mesic nuclei .",
    "the study of @xmath0 meson self - energy in the nuclear matter is also helpful in understanding the properties of the charm and the hidden charm resonances in the nuclear matter @xcite . in coupled channel approach the charmed resonance @xmath29 mainly couples to @xmath30 system , while the @xmath31 couples to @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the hidden charm resonance couples mostly to @xmath5 .",
    "therefore any modification of @xmath0 meson properties in the nuclear medium will affect the properties of these resonances .    within the effective chiral model considered in the present investigation ,",
    "the @xmath12 energies are modified due to a vectorial weinberg - tomozawa , scalar exchange terms ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) as well as range terms @xcite .",
    "the isospin asymmetric effects among @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the doublet , d@xmath36 as well as between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the doublet , @xmath39 arise due to the scalar - isovector @xmath3 meson , due to asymmetric contributons in the weinberg - tomozawa term , as well as in the range term @xcite .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief introduction to the effective chiral @xmath13 model used to study the isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at finite temperatures , and its extension to the chiral @xmath14 model to derive the interactions of the charmed mesons with the light hadrons . in section iii , we present the dispersion relations for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons to be solved to calculate their optical potentials in the hot and dense hadronic matter .",
    "section iv contains the results and discussions and finally , in section v , we summarize the results of present investigation and discuss possible outlook .",

    "the model is based on nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry @xcite and broken scale invariance @xcite .",
    "the effective hadronic chiral lagrangian contains the following terms @xmath41 in eq.(1 ) , @xmath42 is the kinetic energy term , @xmath43 is the baryon - meson interaction term in which the baryons - spin-0 meson interaction term generates the baryon masses .",

    "@xmath46 describes the explicit chiral symmetry breaking .    to study the hadron properties in the present investigation we use the mean field approximation and frozen glue ball limit .",
    "the scalar gluon condensate of qcd is simulated by a scalar dilaton field in the present hadronic model .",
    "since the gluon condensate is known to have a very marginal dependence on the changes in the density , in the present investigation , we take the expectation value of the dilaton field to be constant @xcite .",
    "this is called the frozen glue ball approximation .",

    "it is observed that the drop in the mass of @xmath82 ( @xmath81 ) in isospin symmetric nuclear matter is 30 ( 29.5 ) mev at @xmath112 and 184 ( 183 ) at @xmath111 , at zero temperature , from their vacuum values .",
    "as we go to higher temperatures , the drop in the masses of @xmath82 and @xmath81 mesons decreases .",
    "for example , at @xmath108 = 0 and @xmath101 the drop in the mass of @xmath82 meson is 23 , 16 and 12 mev at a temperature of 50 , 100 and 150 mev respectively .",
    "the masses of @xmath82 and @xmath81 mesons are seen to have negligible dependence on the isospin asymmetry upto a density of @xmath122 .",
    "however , at high densities there is seen to be appreciable dependence of these masses on the parameter , @xmath108 .",
    "for example , at a baryon density of @xmath111 and @xmath108 = 0 , the drop in the mass of the @xmath82 meson is 169 , 140.5 and 117.5 mev for t = 50 , 100 and 150 mev respectively .",
    "but at @xmath108 = 0.5 , these values change to 150 , 131 and 126 mev for t = 50 , 100 and 150 mev respectively .",
    "it is seen that , at high densities there is an increase in the masses of both @xmath82 and @xmath81 mesons in isospin asymmetric medium as compared to those in the isospin symmetric nuclear matter for temperatures t=0 , 50 and 100 mev .",
    "however , at @xmath114 mev , it is observed that for densities upto about 5@xmath99 , the mass of @xmath82 meson is higher in the isospin symmetric matter as compared to in the isospin asymmetric matter with @xmath108 = 0.5 .",
    "it is also seen that the modifications in the masses of @xmath82 mesons is negligible as we change @xmath108 from 0 to 0.3 upto a density of about 4@xmath99 . for the @xmath81 meson",
    ", one sees that the isospin dependence is negligible upto @xmath108=0.3 and the mass is lowered for @xmath108=0.5 as compared to the mass in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the drop in the mass of @xmath81 mesons is 8 mev and 18 mev at @xmath112 and 4@xmath112 respectively . for @xmath81 mesons",
    "also there is seen to be negligible change in mass as we change the aysmmetry paramater @xmath108 from 0 upto 0.3 .",
    "this is because the drop in the mass of @xmath81 mesons given by weinberg - tomozawa term almost cancel with the increase due to the scalar and range terms as we go from @xmath123 to @xmath124 . at zero temperature @xcite as well as for temperatures t=50 and 100 mev",
    ", there is increase in the mass of the @xmath1 mesons ( @xmath38,@xmath37 ) as we go from isospin symmetric medium to the isospin asymmetric medium .",
    "this is because for t=0,50 and 100 mev , the increase in mass of @xmath8 given by the scalar exchange and the range terms were dominating over the drop given by the weinberg tomozawa term as we go from symmetric nuclear medium ( @xmath105 ) to isospin asymmetric nuclear medium ( @xmath108 = 0.1,0.3 0.5 ) .",
    "however , at @xmath114 mev , for @xmath108 = 0.5 , the drop given by weinberg term dominates over the rise given by scalar and range terms for @xmath37 and upto a density of about 5@xmath99 for @xmath38 , and therefore mass of @xmath1 mesons decreases as we go from symmetric nuclear medium to isospin asymmetric nuclear medium in these density regimes .",
    "figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig8 ] show the isospin dependence of the optical potentials for the @xmath0 mesons as functions of the momentum , for densities @xmath112 and @xmath111 respectively and for values of the temperature as @xmath125 mev .",
    "figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig9 ] illustrate the optical potentials for the @xmath1 doublet .",
    "the isospin dependence of optical potentials is seen to be quite significant for high densities for the d - meson doublet ( @xmath109 ) as compared to those for the @xmath8 doublet .",
    "this is a reflection of the strong isospin dependence of the masses of the d - mesons as compared to the @xmath126 as has been already illustrated in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . for the @xmath1 mesons , it is seen , from figure [ fig5 ] , that the masses of the the @xmath82 meson and @xmath81 meson for a fixed value of the isospin asymmetry parameter , @xmath108 are very similar , an observation which was seen earlier for the zero temperature case @xcite .",
    "these are reflected in their optical potentials , plotted in figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig9 ] , where one sees a maximum difference of about 5 mev or so between @xmath38 and @xmath37 for @xmath127 and about 10  15 mev for @xmath100 .",
    "the present investigations of the optical potentials for the @xmath0 and @xmath8 mesons show a much stronger dependence of isospin asymmetry on the @xmath0 meson doublet , as compared to that in the @xmath8 meson doublet , as was already observed for the zero temperature case .",
    "meson ( a , c and e ) and of @xmath67 meson ( b , d and f ) , are plotted as functions of momentum for @xmath128 , for different values of the isospin asymmetry parameter ( @xmath117 ) and for given values of temperature ( t = 0 , 100 mev and 150 mev).,width=604,height=604 ]     meson ( a , c and e ) and of @xmath120 meson ( b , d and f ) , are plotted as functions of momentum for @xmath128 , for different values of the isospin asymmetry parameter ( @xmath117 ) and for given values of temperature ( t = 0 , 100 mev and 150 mev).,width=604,height=604 ]    the medium modifications of the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath129 mesons can lead to the explanation of @xmath9 suppression observed by na50 collaboration at @xmath10 gev / nucleon in the pb - pb collisions @xcite . due to the drop in the mass of the @xmath130 pair in the nuclear medium , it can become a possibility that the excited states of charmonium ( @xmath131 ) can decay to @xmath5 @xcite and hence the production of @xmath132 from the decay of these excited states can be suppressed . even at high values of densities at given temperatures",
    ", it can become a possibility that @xmath9 itself decays to @xmath5 pairs .",
    "thus the medium modifications of the @xmath0 mesons can change the decay widths of the charmonium states @xcite .",
    "the decay of the charmonium states have been studied in ref .",
    "it is seen to depend sensitively on the relative momentum in the final state .",
    "these excited states might become narrow @xcite though the @xmath0 meson mass is decreased appreciably at high densities .",
    "it may even vanish at certain momentum corresponding to nodes in the wave function @xcite . though the decay widths for these excited states can be modified by their wave functions , the partial decay width of @xmath133 , owing to absence of any nodes , can increase monotonically with the drop of the @xmath134 pair mass in the medium .",
    "this can give rise to depletion in the @xmath132 yield in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the dissociation of the quarkonium states ( @xmath135,@xmath136 , @xmath132 ) into @xmath5 pairs has also been studied @xcite by comparing their binding energies with the lattice results on the temperature dependence of the heavy - quark effective potential @xcite .",
    "we have investigated in a chiral model the in - medium masses of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 mesons in hot isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , arising from their interactions with the nucleons and the scalar mesons .",

    "the @xmath13 model , with parameters fixed from the properties of the hadron masses in vacuum and low - energy kn scattering data , is extended to su(4 ) to drive the interactions of @xmath85 mesons with the light hadron sector .",
    "the mass modifications of @xmath68 and @xmath67 mesons is strongly dependent on isospin - asymmetry of medium .",
    "the mass of @xmath0 mesons observed at finite temperature is more as compared to zero temperature case because of less decrease of scalar fields at finite temperature and finite densities .",
    "this is in accordance with earlier work on @xmath0 mesons modifications in symmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the mass modification for the @xmath0 mesons are seen to be similar to earlier finite density calcualtions of qcd sum rules @xcite as well as to the quark - meson coupling model @xcite , in contrast to the small mass modificatins in the coupled channel approach @xcite .",
    "also we obtained small attractive mass shifts for @xmath1 mesons in contrast with coupled channel approach @xcite . these attractive potentials for @xmath1 mesons are in favor of charmed mesic nuclei . in our calculations the presence of the repulsive first range term ( with coefficient @xmath137 in eq .",

    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 terms , @xmath55 term is found to be dominating over @xmath56 term .",
    "the medium modifications of the @xmath0 meson masses can lead to a suppression in the @xmath132 yield in heavy - ion collisions , since the excited states of the @xmath132 ( @xmath138 ) , @xmath132 , can decay to @xmath5 pairs in the dense hadronic medium .",
    "the decay to the @xmath134 pairs seems to be insensitive at zero temperature but at high temperture like @xmath139 mev these decay become sensitive to isospin asymmetry of the medium .",
    "the isospin asymmetry lowers the density at which decay to @xmath134 pairs occur . due to increase in the mass of @xmath140 in the isospin - asymmetric medium , isospin - asymmetry",
    "is seen to disfavor the decay of the charmonium states to the @xmath140 pairs . at a finite temperature there",
    "does not seem to be the possibility of decay of @xmath132 to @xmath140 pairs .",
    "the isospin dependence of @xmath68 and @xmath67 masses is seen to be a dominant medium effect at high densities , which might show in their production ( @xmath141 ) , whereas , for the @xmath82 and @xmath81 , one sees that , even though these have a strong density dependence , their in - medium masses remain similar at a given value for the isospin - asymmetry parameter @xmath108 .",

    "the study of the in - medium modifications of @xmath0 mesons in hyperonic matter along with nucleons at zero and finite temperatures within the chiral @xmath14 model , and the study of in - medium properties of the charmonia states in the hot asymmetric hadronic matter , due to their interactions with the d - mesons as well as interactions to the dilaton field associated with the broken scale invariance ( related to the gluon condensates ) will be possible extensions of the present investigation .",
