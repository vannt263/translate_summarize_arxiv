    "recently , pierre auger observatory published results on correlation of the highest - energy cosmic rays with the positions of nearby active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite .",
    "such a correlation is confirmed by the data of yakutsk @xcite while it is not found in the analysis by hires @xcite . in the auger result ,",
    "the correlation is maximal for the threshold energy of cosmic rays at @xmath0 ev , the maximal distance of agn at @xmath1 mpc and the maximal angular separation of cosmic ray events at @xmath2 . with the same threshold energy , and the angular separation @xmath3 ,",
    "the correlation remains strong for a range of maximal agn distance between @xmath4 mpc and @xmath5 mpc .",
    "due to increasing efforts on verifying the auger result , it is worthwhile to examine the above correlation from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "since the angular scale of the observed correlation is a few degrees , one expects that these cosmic ray particles are predominantly light nuclei .",
    "the effect of gzk attenuations on these cosmic ray particles @xcite can be described by a distance scale referred to as  gzk horizon \" which is a function of the selected energy threshold for the arriving cosmic ray particles . by definition ,",
    "the gzk horizon associated with a threshold energy @xmath6 is the radius of a spherical region which is centered at the earth and produce @xmath7 of uhecr events arriving on earth with energies above @xmath8 . with continuous energy loss approximation ,",
    "the gzk horizon for protons with @xmath9 eev is about @xmath10 mpc by assuming a uniformly distributed uhecr sources with identical cosmic ray luminosity and spectral index @xcite .",
    "the calculations based upon kinetic equation approach or stochastic energy loss also reach to similar conclusions @xcite .",
    "the departure of theoretically calculated gzk horizon to the maximum valid distance of the v - c catalog @xcite employed in pierre auger s analysis , which is around @xmath5 mpc , can be attributed to several factors . as mentioned in @xcite",
    ", such a deviation may arise from non - uniformities of spatial distribution , intrinsic luminosity and spectral index of local agn .",
    "in addition , the energy calibration also plays a crucial role since the gzk horizon is highly sensitive to the threshold energy @xmath6 .",
    "energy values corresponding to the dip and the gzk cutoff of uhecr spectrum were used to calibrate energy scales of different cosmic ray experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that all measured uhecr energy spectra can be brought into good agreements by suitably adjusting the energy scale of each experiment @xcite . keeping the hires energy scale unchanged ,",
    "the energy - adjustment factor @xmath11 is found to be @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively for auger , agasa , akeno and yakutsk . furthermore , it has been shown that a different shower energy reconstruction method infers a @xmath16 higher uhecr energy than that determined by auger s fluorescence detector - based shower reconstruction @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the consistency between auger s uhecr correlation study and its spectrum measurement . as just stated , the v - c catalog used by pierre auger for the correlation study is complete only up to @xmath5 mpc while the gzk horizon for @xmath17 eev is generally of the order @xmath10 mpc .",
    "we first consider the local over - density of uhecr sources as a possible resolution to the above discrepancy .",
    "it is motivated by the existence of local supercluster ( ls ) which has a diameter of the order @xmath18 mpc . in ls ,",
    "the over - density of galaxies has been estimated to be @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the local over - density of uhecr sources has been invoked @xcite to account for agasa data @xcite .",
    "such a density distribution naturally leads to a smaller gzk horizon .",
    "however , it also significantly affects the uhecr energy spectrum in @xmath20 ev region .",
    "hence fittings to the measured uhecr spectrum @xcite can provide information on the degree of local over - density .",
    "subsequently , the magnitude of gzk horizon can be better estimated .",
    "we next study the energy calibration effect on the estimation of gzk horizon and the spectrum of uhecr . certainly a @xmath21 upward shift on uhecr energies reduces the departure of theoretically calculated gzk horizon to the maximum valid distance of v - c catalog @xcite .",
    "the further implications of this shift will be studied in fittings to the shifted auger spectrum .",
    "we fit the uhecr spectrum for events with energies above @xmath22 ev .",
    "this is the energy range where the gzk attenuation exhibits its effect .",
    "it is also the energy range where the local over - density of uhecr sources shows significant effects .",
    "in our analysis , we take the uhecr as protons , which is hinted in the auger events with energies @xmath23 eev although the composition study by the same group suggests a heavier composition for @xmath24 eev @xcite .",
    "the hires experiment measures the composition up to @xmath4 eev @xcite and obtains a composition lighter than that of auger . for @xmath25 eev ,",
    "the event number is still too small for the composition study .",
    "to fit the uhecr spectrum at the highest energy , it is more appropriate to treat the cosmic ray energy loss as a stochastic process @xcite .",
    "there are numerical packages available for treating stochastic energy loss of cosmic ray particles @xcite .",
    "we employ the latter package for our calculations .",
    "although uhecr loses its energy mostly by scattering off cmb photons , it also loses some amount of energy by scattering off infrared background photons @xcite .",
    "thus we include the infrared photon contribution to the uhecr energy attenuation .",
    "source evolution @xmath26 is adopted in the calculation of gzk horizon and spectrum , where @xmath27 is the source number density at the present epoch .",
    "it is from the generally - accepted soft evolution model which traces the star formation history and has been adopted in previous works @xcite .",
    "we discuss about gzk horizons in sec .",
    "we calculate the accumulated event probabilities of uhecr for @xmath9 eev , @xmath28 eev , @xmath29 eev and @xmath30 eev respectively .",
    "gzk horizons corresponding to different @xmath6 are tabulated .",
    "we also calculate gzk horizons with local over - density of uhecr sources taken into account . in sec .",
    "iii , we fit the measured uhecr spectrum with various local over - densities of uhecr sources and obtain information on the degree of local over - density . to study the energy calibration effect",
    ", we also perform fittings to the shifted uhecr spectrum .",
    "iv contains discussions and conclusions .",
    "for single uhecr source , the cosmic - ray energy attenuation is governed by the equation @xmath31 , \\label{conserve}\\ ] ] in the continuous energy loss approximation .",
    "this equation results from the number conservation of cosmic - ray particles in the energy attenuation process .",
    "the cosmic - ray energy loss per unit time @xmath32 is due to the cosmic expansion and its scattering with cosmic microwave background photons through photo - pion production process @xmath33 and pair production process @xmath34 .",
    "the above attenuation equation is well known @xcite . in the current context , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ conserve ] ) can be expressed in terms of the red - shift variable @xcite @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the red - shift of the uhecr source and the function @xmath37 is related to the rate of cosmic - ray energy loss at the present epoch by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the present value of hubble constant .",
    "the uhecr has an energy @xmath40 at the source with red - shift @xmath36 and its energy is downgraded to @xmath41 at the red - shift @xmath42 .",
    "the energy @xmath40 is a function of @xmath41 and @xmath42 so that @xmath43 and @xmath44 due to the non - trivial form of @xmath37 , one resorts to numerical methods for computing the function @xmath40 and the flux @xmath45 .",
    "we have mentioned that the stochastic nature of uhecr energy loss can not be overlooked for shorter propagation distances @xcite .",
    "one then treats the energy attenuation by photo - pion production as a stochastic process while treating other attenuations as continuous processes .      to facilitate our discussions ,",
    "we define the accumulative event probabilities of uhecr as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of cosmic ray events which are originated from sources at distances between @xmath49 and @xmath50 from the earth and arrive at the detector with energies above @xmath6 .",
    "we calculate @xmath51 for various local over - densities of uhecr sources .",
    "the source distribution over the red - shift is taken as @xmath26 and the energy spectrum of each source is taken to be the form , @xmath52 , with the maximal energy @xmath53 eev .",
    "we choose @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 gives the best fitting to the measured uhecr spectrum as will be shown in the next section .",
    "the accumulative event probability @xmath58 for @xmath9 eev , @xmath28 eev , @xmath29 eev and @xmath30 eev are shown in fig .",
    "[ survival_prob ] for @xmath54 .",
    "results for @xmath57 and @xmath59 are not distinguishable from those for @xmath54 . in each panel ,",
    "the red , green , blue , and black curves represent local over - density @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "the local over - density @xmath62 is defined explicitly as @xmath63 the horizontal dash line in each panel denotes @xmath64 .",
    "the intersection of this line with each color curve gives the gzk horizon corresponding to a specific local over - density characterized by the ratio @xmath65 .",
    ".gzk horizons of uhecr calculated with the local over - density @xmath66 and @xmath61 , and arrival threshold energy @xmath9 eev , @xmath28 eev , @xmath29 eev and @xmath30 eev respectively .",
    "the listed numbers are in units of mpc . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for @xmath9 eev",
    ", only @xmath67 of cosmic ray events come from sources less than @xmath68 mpc away for @xmath69 . for @xmath70 and the same threshold energy , @xmath16 of cosmic ray events are originated from sources in the same region .",
    "it should be stressed that we have focused only on resolving the apparent discrepancy between the gzk horizon at @xmath9 eev and the maximum valid distance of v - c catalog .",
    "the statistics analysis for establishing the source correlation is an independent issue beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "we have found that the above discrepancy can not be resolved by merely introducing the local over - density of uhecr sources . on the other hand ,",
    "if auger s energy calibration indeed underestimates the uhecr energy , such a discrepancy can be reduced .",
    "more importantly , fittings to the shifted auger spectrum indicate a possible local over - density of uhecr sources , which is testable in the future cosmic ray astronomy .",
