    "it is proposed that only one minimum - energy basin of attraction is accessible to the system .",
    "one of the first arguments of this type is due to gibbs and dimarzio  @xcite , but more recent studies using replica methods have yielded evidence in support of such a transition in lennard - jones glass formers  @xcite .",
    "these observations have been called into question by experimental data and recent results of simulations of polydisperse hard - core disks , which have failed to detect any evidence of a thermodynamic transition up to extremely high packing fractions  @xcite .",
    "one of the questions that arises is therefore whether the discrepancies between the reported simulated behavior of hard - disk and soft - sphere systems is due to fundamental differences in the models , or whether they are a consequence of inappropriate sampling at low temperatures and high densities .",
    "different , alternative theoretical considerations have attempted to establish a connection between glass transition phenomena and the rapid increase in relaxation times that arises in the vicinity of a theoretical critical temperature ( the so - called `` mode - coupling '' temperature , @xmath6 ) , thereby giving rise to a `` kinetic '' or `` dynamic '' transition  @xcite . in recent years , both viewpoints have received some support from molecular simulations .",
    "many of these simulations have been conducted in the context of models introduced by stillinger and weber and by kob and andersen  @xcite ; such models have been employed in a number of studies that have helped shape our current views about the glass transition  @xcite .    in its simplest ( `` idealized '' ) version , firstly analyzed in the `` schematic '' approach by bengtzelius et al .",

    "there are further posibilities to estimates @xmath0 , e.g. , from the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients or the relaxation time of the final @xmath7-decay in the melt , as these quantities for @xmath9 display a critical behaviour @xmath10 .",
    "however , only crude estimates of @xmath0 can be obtained from these quantities , since near @xmath0 the critical behaviour is masked by the effects of transversale currents and thermally activated matter transport , as mentioned above .    on the other hand ,",
    "as emphasized and applied in @xcite , the value of @xmath0 predicted by the idealized mct can be calculated once the partial structure factors of the system and their temperature dependence are sufficiently well known . besides temperature and particle concentration , the partial structure factors are the only significant quantities which enter the equations of the so - called nonergodicity parameters of the system .",
    "the latter vanish identically for temperatures above @xmath0 and their calculation thus allows a rather precise determination of the critical temperature predicted by the idealized theory .    at this stage",
