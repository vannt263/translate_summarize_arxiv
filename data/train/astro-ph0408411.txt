    ", however , no paradigm exists describing how stellar formation proceeds within clusters inside turbulent cloud cores ( meyer et al .",
    "such cores can contain starless objects , i.e. , local maxima of arbitrarily high column density where no evidence for star formation has been detected , as well as extremely young protostellar objects , i.e. , locations where evidence for star formation has been detected . observations of these objects in clusters should significantly improve our understanding of how they form .",

    ", the oph a core contains a protostellar cluster including the prototypical  class 0 \" object , vla 1623 , in addition to starless objects to its north and east named sm1n , sm1 , and sm2 ( see andr , ward - thompson , & barsony 1993 ; awb93 ) .",
    "wide - field 1.3 mm continuum maps by motte , andr , & neri ( 1998 ; man98 ) revealed oph a is the brightest of the oph cores , and a multiresolution wavelet analysis of its emission suggested the presence of eight other starless objects in oph a. the objects a - mm6 , a - mm7 , and a - mm8 , together with sm1n , sm1 , and sm2 , comprise an arc within the filamentary structure of oph a centered on the nearby b star s1 ( see figure 2a of man98 ) .",
    "man98 also found the starless objects in the oph cores have a mass spectrum reminiscent of the stellar imf , suggesting a link exists between the formation of these objects and actual stars in clusters .    in this paper , we examine emission from dense gas associated with the oph a core , using combined single - dish and interferometer data to attain a linear resolution of @xmath21000 au . we observed the 10 transition of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 molecular ion",

    "this situation is different from that seen in isolated cores where coincidence between dust and n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission is common .",
    "the difference is likely due to variations in n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance within oph a arising from differences in the relative density and dust temperature within each object .",
    "focusing on the line emission alone , we find that its widths vary by a factor of @xmath25 in oph a , with several locations having fwhms @xmath4 0.3 km s@xmath5 .",

    "small - scale centroid velocity gradients are found near the sm1 , sm1n , and sm2 objects .",
    "the quiescent and slow motions of objects in oph a objects contrast sharply with the turblent and dynamic motions expected in some models of cluster formation .",
    "one integrated line intensity maximum , oph a - n6 , has line widths as low as 0.193 km s@xmath5 fwhm , or just larger than the line width expected from thermal motions alone , indicating localized reduction of turbulent motions within oph a.    details of our observations are described in  2 .",

    "assuming the gas of n6 is isothermal at @xmath60 = 17.4 k ( see  3 ) , the mean nonthermal component @xmath85 = 0.080 km s@xmath5 and @xmath40 = 0.26 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the observed quantities of oph a - n6 are within a factor of 2 of those predicted from simple models of equilibrium spheres .",
    "for example , the mass - radius ratio of a uniform sphere in gravitational virial equilibrium is @xmath86 and that of a critically - stable bonnor - ebert sphere is @xmath87 ( bonnor 1956 ) . given the effective radius and mass of n6 , the mean velocity dispersions predicted from these simple models are 0.31 km s@xmath5 and 0.45 km s@xmath5 respectively , i.e. , more than that of n6 itself by factors of 1.2 and 1.7 respectively .",
    "like oph a as a whole , n6 is in gravitational virial equilibrium to first order .",
    "( again , the differences are likely not significant enough to suggest n6 has insufficent support against gravity . )",
    "interestingly , the mass and radius of n6 can be reproduced simultaneously if the mass - radius ratio @xmath52 @xmath88 , a situation that could occur , e.g. , in virial equilibrium if magnetic energy @xmath44",
    "@xmath52 @xmath89 , or more if surface pressure is also non - zero .",
    "there are three questions about oph a - n6 that simple equilibrium models do not directly address .",
    "first , why does n6 have such narrow line widths that suggest it has relatively little turbulence ?",
    "second , why are these line widths narrower than those in its immediate surroundings ?",
    "third , why is n6 located so close to its neighbor sm2 ?",
    "these questions may be answered simultaneously by considering models of equilibrium spheres embedded in sufficiently turbulent and opaque cores . within such environments ,",
    "turbulent motions could be reduced locally , e.g. , if the spheres were similar or smaller in size than the cutoff wavelength for mhd waves in their surroundings ( mckee 1989 , mckee et al .",
    "( turbulence could instead be damped locally by other processes such as shocks or dissipation ; e.g. , see nakano 1998 . ) myers ( 1999 ; see also myers 1997 ) , following reasoning by larson ( 1985 ) and mouschovias ( 1991 ) , proposed thermally dominated , critically stable bonnor - ebert spheres could exist within turbulent , opaque , and dense cores .",
    "such cores require large column densities ( e.g. , @xmath90 @xmath49 4 ) , so that ionization by cosmic rays dominates over that by ultraviolet radiation , and the coupling between the magnetic field and the gas is minimized .",
    "the embedded objects , called  kernels \" by myers , would be compressed by external ( turbulent ) core pressure to sizes comparable to the observed separations of young stellar objects within embedded clusters ( e.g. , @xmath20.05 - 0.15 pc ) . a protostellar cluster could then arise from the near - simultaneous collapse of several kernels within a common core .",
    "oph a - n6 may be an excellent candidate for a kernel - like object , given its near - thermal line widths .",
    "furthermore , its 0.9 m  mass matches quite well the 0.8 m  mean mass predicted for kernels within nearby star forming molecular cores , i.e. , masses obtained by myers using values of @xmath62 , @xmath64 and @xmath91 derived by from harju , walmsley , & wouterloot ( 1993 ) and ladd , myers , & goodman ( 1994 ) . also , the projected separation between n6 and sm2 is 0.025 pc , within a factor of @xmath22 of the @xmath20.05 pc separation of kernels predicted by myers .",
    "( indeed , the mean nearest - neighbor separation of n6 , sm1n , sm1 , sm2 , and vla 1623 , is only 0.023 pc . )",
    "oph a - n6 does not fit completely to a kernel interpretation , however . as noted above",
    ", its 0.008 pc radius is @xmath23 smaller than the 0.024 pc mean radius expected for such kernels .",
    "( note that the radius of a singular isothermal sphere ( shu 1977 ) at @xmath62 = 17.4 k required to make a 0.9 m  star is @xmath20.032 pc , a factor of @xmath24 larger than that of n6 . ) despite these caveats , however , the kernel model provides at least some basis for understanding n6 as a highly localized region of low turbulence , unlike simple equilibrium models .",
    "the non - detection of oph a - n6 as a two - dimensional maximum of @xmath28(h@xmath0 ) but its clear detection as a location of maximal @xmath28(n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) suggest that interesting sites possibly related to star formation may be overlooked in maps of thermal continuum emission .",
    "why was n6 not seen , e.g. , by man98 ?",
    "contrasts of @xmath28(h@xmath0 ) in n6 could be minimized if dust at its inner radii are colder than dust at its outer radii ( e.g. , see evans et al . ) , a strong possibility given the high densities and extinctions observed in oph a. note , however , that bouwman , galli , & andr ( 2004 , in preparation ; see also andr et al .",
    "2003 ) have recently shown that 1.3 mm continuum flux and @xmath37 are anticorrelated in starless cores , even those with the high column densities and incident radiation fields of oph a ( e.g. , 85 @xmath92 ; liseau et al .",
    "the oph a objects , especially n6 , must be specifically modeled to evaluate better this possibility .",
    "if oph a - n6 is a kernel - like object , we speculate that the oph a continuum objects may also be or once were kernel - like . in this scenario",
    ", the large @xmath3 of these objects relative to that of oph a - n6 may suggest that they are now in a state of collapse .",
    "for example , n6 has narrow lines close to the thermal line width ; an absence of wings or asymmetrically blue profiles in the line suggest that collapse has not yet occurred.h@xmath1 10 has thermalized within n6 , and @xmath23 @xmath52 @xmath71 , the line will not show infall asymmetry if no gradient in @xmath23 exists . ]",
    "if the continuum objects have had similar physical conditions to n6 earlier , turbulence may have been similarly reduced at that epoch .",
    "therefore , their larger @xmath3 may not be due to substantial turbulent motions in their associated gas .",
    "indeed , how turbulent motions could be reintroduced to these objects after its reduction in the absence of protostars , winds , or outflows is unclear . instead , gas within these objects may still be thermally dominated and the line broadening observed may be due to infall motions stemming from collapse .",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath1 10 line is only marginally optically thick toward these objects , so the line should remain symmetric , as seen in figure 5 , if emitted from infalling gas ( myers , evans , & ohashi 2000 ) .",
    "we note here again that sm1 , sm1n , and sm2 are found relatively close to ( but are not coincident with ) positions of the largest @xmath3 in oph a ; these extreme line widths may also be caused by infall motions related to these objects .",
    "furthermore , the correlation of @xmath3 vs. @xmath6 found for bright line emission shown in fig .",
    "6a may be also related to infall motions .",
    "the observed fwzis of n@xmath0h@xmath1 10 toward sm1n , sm1 , and sm2 are @xmath21.0 km s@xmath5 , suggesting infall motions on scales of @xmath21000 - 3000 au up to 0.5 km s@xmath5 , similar to those measured directly toward the class 0 objects ngc 1333 iras 4a and 4b by di francesco et al .",
    "further speculating , we note that the variations of @xmath6 in oph a may provide additional evidence for differences in the evolutionary stages of starless objects within oph a , by supporting the idea that oph a - n6 is not collapsing but sm1n , sm1 , and sm2 may be .",
    "n6 appears to have no associated n@xmath0h@xmath1 10 velocity gradients but the continuum objects have small ones ( i.e. , @xmath560.5 km s@xmath5 over @xmath20.01 pc ; see fig .",
    "3b ) . such small velocity gradients could stem from increases in local rotation speeds of dense gas that could accompany inward motions due to angular momentum conservation .",
    "( indeed line broadening by rotational motions may also be contributing to the larger line widths associated with these objects .",
    "note that the gradients in fig .",
    "3b , however , are seen on scales larger than the beam size . )",
    "high - resolution data of oph a in other tracers of quiescent dense gas that require higher levels of excitation than n@xmath0h@xmath1 10 could reveal velocity gradients more dominated by infall or rotation and clarify this issue ( e.g. , see caselli et al .",

    "are presented that yield a map of dense gas at high linear resolution ( e.g. , @xmath21000 au ) with information retained on large spatial scales .",
    "six maxima of integrated line intensity , oph a - n1 through n6 , have been detected .",
    "n4 and n5 are coincident with the starless objects sm1 and sm1n respectively .",
    "the other maxima , however , are not coincident with known starless or protostellar oph a objects .",
    "moreover , little n@xmath0h@xmath1 10 emission is associated with the starless object sm2 or the class 0 protostar vla 1623 .",

    "similar depletion may not have occurred at sm1 or sm1n because their dust is warmer , e.g. , @xmath37 = 27 k , perhaps inhibiting n@xmath0 adsoption .",
