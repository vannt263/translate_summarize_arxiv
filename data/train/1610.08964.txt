    "this is not so important for analytic calculations , but becomes crucial for the numerics .",
    "the physicality of trajectory probabilities is crucially important in quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "the qmc is the only choice in cases when it is difficult to identify small or large parameter , and the dimension of phase space is high .",
    "a number of efficient qmc algorithms are known for the imaginary time domain , so that contemporary qmc can efficiently solve equilibruim quantum problems .",
    "however in real time the trajectory weights are complex and oscillating .",
    "currently there is no understanding of how to efficiently arrange the sampling procedure .",
    "this is the so - called sign problem .    for more than half a century",
    ", it has been made a lot of attemps to solve this problem .",
    "the most notable and oldest are : to enforce the controlled cancellation of oscillating trajectory weigths ( filtering @xcite and multilevel blocking @xcite techniques ) ; analytic continuation with respect to the time variable @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , none of these methods enables us to simulate large correlated systems for long enough times .",
    "another group of approaches which is currently under active investigations is based on the idea to perform analytic continuation of probability amplitudes with respect to the ( field ) configurations @xmath0 .",
    "this approach takes its origin from the works of parisi @xcite and of klauder and petersen @xcite where first time the idea was proposed of how to sample the complex probabilities with the aid of complex langevin equation . while having limited success for certain model systems , the method of complex langevin equations suffer from instabilities when applied to more realistic systems and for longer simulation times @xcite .",
    "later a modification of the idea was proposed : to introduce complexified configurations @xmath0 in path integrals and shift the integration contour ( domain ) in order to make the oscillations of trajectory weights milder @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by locating the stationary points of complexified ( analytically continued ) action @xmath2 $ ] and find the pathes ( hypersurfaces ) of steepest descent .",
    "these pathes are called lefschetz thimbles ( lt ) .",
    "they have the property that the phase ( real part of @xmath2 $ ] ) is constant on them .",
    "the idea is to perform monte carlo sampling on lefschetz thimbles @xcite .",
    "the limitations of this approach follow from the fact that lefschetz thimble is a complicated curved hypersurface for which there is no explicit relations . nevertheless , there are promising results and developments @xcite . in a recently published work",
    "an idea was proposed to conduct monte carlo simulations in the vicinity of lefschetz thimble so that the oscillations of trajectory weights are greatly supressed @xcite .",
    "a common feature of complex langevin and lefschetz thimble methods is that they start from a given discretized path integral on a given integration domain and then just try to complexity it ( to continuously deform the integration domain into the complex plane ) .    in this work",
    "we reconsider the standard derivation of path integrals @xcite and construct a discretized action where the path integration domain can be deformed so that at least gaussian integrals become probabilistic .",
    "it turns out that there is rich freedom when constructing discretized actions . here",
    "we explore only one component of this freedom , the integration contour ( domain ) independence , which turns out to be richer than in lefschetz thimble methods .",
    "we discuss the relation of the analytical continuation approach with the feynman s arguments that it is imposible to simulate quantum dynamics on classical local probabilistic computer @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on work @xcite . as a particular application of this general methodology",
    ", we consider a quantum system interacting with gaussian heat bath and show that probabilistic path integral for the heat bath leads to a stochastic evolution of reduced system state , analogous to what was derived from different considerations in works @xcite .",
    "we believe that the rich freedom implicilty present in the discretized path integral actions will help us to devise novel simulation algorithms for real - time quantum dynamics , and to improve efficiency of the existing complex langevin and lefschetz thimble methods .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that the expression for discretized path integral action is not unique , and we can exploit this fact in order to make the gaussian path integral real positive .",
