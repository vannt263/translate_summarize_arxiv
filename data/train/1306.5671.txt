    "as is well known , the landau paradigm classifies the various symmetry - breaking phases according to symmetry groups.@xcite nevertheless , the existence of a qpt between spt phases and trivial ones shows that gapped phases without symmetry breaking in one dimension ( and also in higher dimensions ) can still be distinct and classified by the group cohomology of symmetries.@xcite    to be specific , we consider the gapped phases in so(3 ) heisenberg chains , which can be generally classified by different projective representations of the rotational so(3 ) group , i.e. , the corresponding group cohomology @xmath26 .",

    "@xcite    it has recently been discovered that these two phases also differ strikingly in the structure of their entanglement spectra .",
    "the entanglement spectrum consists of the eigenvalues of the entanglement hamiltonian @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the reduced density matrix of a subsystem.@xcite the entanglement spectrum of the bulk has an intimate relationship with the real excitation spectrum on the boundary.@xcite closely related with the group cohomology classification , an interesting feature has been found : for the spin-1 chain , the entanglement spectrum is found to show at least two - fold degeneracy for the haldane phase , while it is generally non - degenerate for the trivial phase.@xcite the occurrence of the two - fold degeneracy can be used to numerically identify the haldane phase .    actually , this degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum is a signature of the appearance of half - integer - spin multiplets in the mps geometric bond , which support projective representations of the so(3 ) group .",
    "take the aklt point as an intuitive example : according to the construction of the aklt state , each local spin-1 is decomposed into two spin-1/2 ancillas .",
    "the aklt state can be exactly expressed as mps with bond dimension 2 , hence only one @xmath31 doublet appears on each of its geometric bonds , and the entanglement spectrum is two - fold degenerate .",
    "for other generic states in the haldane phase , the multiplets on the geometric bonds are generally @xmath32=half - integer , which leads to at least two - fold degeneracy and supports projective representations .",
    "this key feature can be used to differentiate the spt phase from the trivial one , the latter instead has integer bond multiplets that support linear representations . therefore , if we could _ directly identify the virtual spins _ on the geometric bonds of the mps , it would be straightforward to see whether the representation is projective or linear , and thus to identify the spt or trivial phase .",
    "one powerful numerical method for solving 1d quantum spin models is the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg).@xcite in order to further improve its efficiency and stability , abelian and non - abelian symmetries have been implemented in the dmrg algorithm.@xcite in particular , the su(2 ) dmrg technique enables us to identify the spin of the multiplets on the virtual bonds .",
    "note , though , that if open boundary conditions are adopted for su(2 ) dmrg , because only integer - spin sectors are allowed by adding spin-1 s together , the renormalized bases on the virtual bonds are automatically integer multiplets , i.e. , linear representations of so(3 ) .",
    "this would imply the absence of two - fold degeneracy within each multiplet ( every multiplet contains odd number of individual states ) even in haldane phase , which seems paradoxical .    to solve this problem",
    ", we propose a protocol algorithm in this paper which automatically determines the proper bond representations .",
    "in addition , by defining and calculating the integer and half - integer entanglement entropies , we elucidate why this protocol algorithm works , and obtain a simple criterion for identifying the spt phase .",

    "their eigenvalues @xmath60 determine the multiplet entanglement spectrum defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the reduced - density - matrix eigenvalue corresponding to each multiplet .    in order to illustrate the above concepts ,",

    "[ fig - sketch ] ( a ) for the lattice geometry and ( d ) for corresponding mps ] .",
    "we use generalized boundary conditions on both ends of the mps , in that the left ( right ) input bases of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) can be specified as desired .",
    "the most natural choice in dmrg is to take the input basis to be a singlet @xmath36 , as usually done for open boundary conditions . in that case , however , the spin quantum number @xmath32 of the virtual bond multiplets would automatically be integer , as only integer @xmath32 results when adding two integer spins together . for this reason , su(2 )",
    "dmrg calculations with conventional open boundary conditions will never yield the half - integer bond ( projective ) representation of the so(3 ) symmetry , but always a  trivial \" state without the expected ( at least ) two - fold degeneracy in each bond multiplet expected for the haldane phase .    on the other hand",
    ", the boundary can also be set up by taking both end bonds to be @xmath31 doublets , instead of singlets @xmath36.@xcite since then only half - integer multiplets appear in the virtual bonds , this always yields an  spt \" state possessing doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum . in particular , for the spin-1 chain of hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq - bbq ] ) , this choice of boundary condition produces an  spt \" state for any @xmath65 $ ] .",

    ", we here also study a more general situation , where we input the direct sum @xmath67 on the two boundary bonds .",
    "this gives rise to the possibility of both integer and half - integer multiplets on the bonds , and allows us to do actually parallel dmrg calculations in two independent symmetry sections , i.e. , integer and half - integer bond spaces .",
    "we thus adopt the following _ protocol algorithm for determining the bond representations _ : we input both integer and half - integer multiplets on the boundary virtual bonds , and perform several dmrg sweeps back and forth . in the presence of state space truncation along the bonds , depending on the hamiltonian parameters , the system will eventually converge to the half - integer projective representation or the integer linear representation of so(3 ) , thus telling the spt phase from a trivial one .",

    "the integer - spin multiplet spectrum evidently displays a two - fold degeneracy , whereas the half - integer - spin multiplet spectrum does not .",

    "the shift value @xmath37 is chosen because the two representations have different numbers of states with nonzero weights in their reduced density matrices .",
    "the nonzero individual states in the integer representation are twice as many as those in the half - integer one .",
    "this different behavior of the degeneracies in the integer and half - integer multiplet entanglement spectra can be understood as follows : in the presence of space inversion symmetry , time reversal symmetry , or some @xmath16 rotational symmetry , etc . , which protects the haldane phase , it has been proven that @xmath74 has an even degeneracy of at least 2 .",
    "@xcite therefore in the haldane phase , either @xmath75 or @xmath76 should have even degeneracy .",
    "for the half - integer bond representation , the @xmath77 s are half - integer and therefore the @xmath76 s are identity matrices with an even number of diagonal elements , implying that an even degeneracy appears in the cgc space ; thus the @xmath75 in the reduced multiplet space is not necessarily two - fold degenerate , which explains the absence of degeneracies in the multiplet spectrum @xmath78 ( asterisks ) . on the other hand , for integer bond representations , the @xmath76 s are identity matrices of odd - number rank , therefore an even degeneracy must instead appear on the multiplet level , which explains the two - fold degeneracy obtained in @xmath79 ( circles ) .",
    "this difference between integer and half - integer representations has an important consequence in the entanglement entropy , which will be discussed in the next section .    to summarize , the lesson learnt from fig .",
    "[ fig - ent - spec ] is as follows . in fig .",
    "[ fig - ent - spec ] ( a ) we showed that , if mixed boundary @xmath68 is adopted , dmrg sweep can select the half - integer - spin representation in the haldane phase and integer - spin representation in the trivial phase .",
    "[ fig - ent - spec ] ( b ) illustrates that if one studies the haldane phase using auxiliary spin @xmath36 or @xmath31 on the external bond , respectively , then the general requirement of having an entanglement spectrum of even degeneracy is satisfied by having the multiplet spectrum being degenerate or non - degenerate for the case of integer - spin or half - integer - spin representation , respectively .     and @xmath1 , of the spin-1 blbq model , for @xmath80 ( dash - dotted lines ) and @xmath81 ( solid lines ) .",
    "results for different system sizes coincide for @xmath7-values far from the critical point at @xmath82 ( vertical dash - dotted line ) , but differ in the intermediate region between the two vertical dashed lines .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 cross at a ",
    "pseudo - transition \" point @xmath83 , which moves towards the critical point as the system size is increased ( shown in panel ( d ) , the extrapolated point is very close to the true critical one ) . in the above calculations ,",
    "400 multiplets ( about 1600 individual states ) have been retained , the truncation errors are of the order @xmath84 around critical point , and are negligible ( @xmath85 or less ) for the rest parameters .",
    "the entanglement entropies are evaluated at the center of the chain .",
    "panel ( a ) also shows the entanglement entropy obtained by the itebd algorithm@xcite ( asterisks ) , which favors the minimally entangled states , and always follows the lower entanglement entropies .",
    "( b ) the entanglement gap @xmath86 , which equals @xmath87 in the spt phase and the trivial phase respectively .",
    "the dashed vertical lines mark the intermediate region , where @xmath88 is not a constant owing to finite size effects .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the string order parameter ( sop @xmath89 ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq - sop ] ) , obtained by itebd calculations , which retain up to 200 states . ]",
    "during the dmrg sweeps in the protocol using @xmath68 as boundary , as long as the doublet @xmath31 is not physically coupled to the bulk ( the coupling strength between the auxiliary boundary spin-1/2 and the spin-1 chain can be set to be very weak or even turned off ) , the integer and half - integer symmetry sectors have exactly the same ground - state energy .",
    "therefore , the energy is irrelevant in selecting the symmetry sector in the protocol algorithm . instead , since the two - site update scheme of dmrg is adopted during the sweeps , the truncation and hence the entanglement entropy is important in selecting the symmetry sector .",
    "in order to uncover this mechanism underlying the protocol algorithm , we now study the bipartite entanglement entropies in the integer and half - integer symmetry sectors , respectively , by enforcing different boundary states .",
    "the entanglement entropies are defined as @xmath90 ,   \\label{eq - ent - ent}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 or @xmath92 for half - integer or integer representations , and the difference @xmath93 will be called the  entanglement gap \" . in eq .",

    "we note the su(2 ) multiplet language used to formulate eq .",
    "( 6 ) for the von neumann entropy can easily be applied to also calculate the renyi entropy .",
    "very recently , the latter has been employed to study the local differential convertibility and thereby probe the spt phase.@xcite though we here focus only on the von neumann entropy , our analysis can be be generalized straightforwardly to the renyi entropy .    in fig .",

    "this contradicts the conclusion in ref . , where the transition is argued to be of weakly first - order .",
    "in order to thoroughly clarify the transition order , more detailed studies of the correlation functions and excitation gaps are needed , which we leave as future studies .",

    "the latter can be obtained by attaching auxilliary spin-1 s on both ends in our su(2 ) dmrg .    for @xmath187 , @xmath188 in fig .",
    "[ fig - ladder ] , thus the ground state favors integer - spin representation , verifying the triviality of the ground state .",

    "the system is in the same phase as the spin-2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain ( reached in the limiting case @xmath191 ) .",
    "[ fig - ladder ] shows that the ground states in this region also favor integer representations .",
    "however , the lowest multiplet in the entanglement spectrum is the spin triplet @xmath22 , rather than the singlet @xmath184 , consistent with the results of ref . .",

    "[ fig - ladder ] ( a ) ( indicated by a dashed line ) , which represents the  true \" entanglement entropy of the system .",
    "no sign of criticality can be seen from the entanglement entropies , and it is hence believed that only one disordered phase exists in the spin-1 heisenberg ladder model .",
    "our observation is in agreement with the conclusion in ref .",
    ", that the model does not undergo any phase transition from @xmath190 to @xmath187 .",
    "the fact that there does not exist an spt phase in the spin-1 heisenberg ladder model studied above can be ascribed to the triviality of the standard @xmath194 aklt states , which can be adiabatically connected to the topologically trivial state without any phase transition .",
    "@xcite the triviality of the standard @xmath194 aklt state can be also be intuitively understood as follows : it has _ two _ valence bonds ( corresponding to two virtual spin-1/2 ) living on each geometric bond , since these two virtual spin-1/2 couple to either spin 0 or 1 , the total spin forms integer - spin representations of so(3 ) on the geometric bond , leading to a conclusion of a topologically trivial phase .",
    "this argument also applies to the spin-1 heisenberg ladder studied above ( especially when @xmath190 ) .",
    "the bond states are more complicated for the general two - leg heisenberg ladder model , nevertheless , they form integer representations of so(3 ) and the corresponding groundstate belongs to a trivial phase .",
    "we have proposed a novel way to identify spt phases in one dimension by evaluating entanglement entropies . with su(2 ) dmrg method , we can keep track of the bond multiplets , and readily tell half - integer - spin projective representation from integer - spin ones by checking the multiplet entanglement spectrum introduced in this paper . in addition , we have shown that auxiliary boundary spins attached on both ends of the chain can be used to control the bond representations ; this significantly changes the entanglement entropies in the bulk , depending on the topological properties of the phase .    in the spt phase",
    ", we showed that a two - fold degeneracy for the overall entanglement spectrum appears either in the reduced multiplet space or in the cgc space , depending on whether the integer or half - integer bond representations are adopted , respectively . in the latter case ,",
    "the two - fold degeneracy occurs in cgc space , which reduces the entanglement entropy @xmath1 relative to @xmath0 ( entanglement gap @xmath125 ) , providing a practical criterion for identifying spt phases .",
    "the existence of an entanglement entropy gap also allows us to automatically select the ",
    "correct \" representation ( integer or half - integer ) through dmrg sweeps , which always favor low entanglement representation .",
    "the entanglement gap closes at the critical point , which can be used to detect the quantum phase transitions .",
    "several 1d and quasi-1d systems have been studied in this work ; the spt phase in the spin-1 chain and the spin-1 tube model are successfully identified by evaluating the entanglement entropies . for the spin-1 tube model ,",
    "the numerical results indicate that the phase transition between the spt phase and the trivial phase is a continuous one .",
