    "an antiferromagnetic ordering in caruo@xmath0,@xcite various other studies suggest absence of long - range order down to the lowest temperature studied.@xcite these later investigations predict that the behavior in this compound is in the proximity of quantum criticality , which is manifested in the transport measurements exhibiting non - fermi liquid behavior.@xcite    = 4.0 in    both srruo@xmath0 and caruo@xmath0 form in an orthorhombic perovskite structure ( abo@xmath0 - type ) .",

    "the ruo@xmath5 octahedra in these compounds are connected by corner sharing as shown in fig .  1",

    "the tilting and buckling of the ruo@xmath5 octahedra as evident in the figure essentially leads to a gdfeo@xmath0 type distortion resulting to the orthorhombic structure .",
    "while the structure type is same in both the compounds , the extent of distortion is somewhat different resulting to a slightly different ru - o - ru bond angle in these compounds .",
    "if o(1 ) represents the apical oxygen in the ruo@xmath5 octahedra along @xmath6-axis in the figure and o(2 ) represents the oxygens in the basal ( @xmath7 ) plane , there are two o(2 ) and one o(1 ) atoms in one formula unit .",

    "ru - o(1)-ru = 149.6@xmath8 , ru - o(2)-ru = 149.8@xmath8 .",
    "the ru - o - ru angle has significant influence in the electronic properties since the electron hopping interaction strength between ru - sites via oxygens , usually denoted by @xmath9 is the largest for the angle of 180@xmath8 and gradually reduces with the deviation of ru - o - ru bond angle from 180@xmath8 .",
    "thus , the effective electron correlation strength , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 = electron - electron coulomb repulsion strength and @xmath12 = valence band width ) is expected to be higher in caruo@xmath0 than that in srruo@xmath0 .",

    "this axis system is very close to the local axis system of the ruo@xmath5 octahedra . the deviations due to the orthorhombic distortions are clearly manifested by small intensities in the energy range corresponding to other symmetries .",

    "all these magnetic moments centered at different ru and o sites couple ferromagnetically .",
    "thus , the total spin magnetic moment per formula unit is found to be about 1.2  @xmath1 and is very close to the experimental estimation of 1.4  @xmath37  0.4  @xmath1 from various measurements on varieties of samples in single and polycrystalline forms.@xcite    interestingly , the total magnetic moment , although consistent to the experimental estimations , is significantly lower than the spin only value for the @xmath38 electronic configuration for ru@xmath34 ions .",
    "this is significantly different from 3@xmath2 transition metal oxides , where the calculated magnetic moment is often found very close to their spin only value corresponding to the electronic configuration close to the transition metal ions . while it has been observed that various other approximations , such as generalized gradient approximations , inclusion of spin - orbit coupling _ etc .",
    "_ leads to a larger value of the spin magnetic moment in the ground state , the experimental observation of small saturation magnetic moment even for high quality single crystals suggests that other effects are important for this system .",
    "in particular , the orbital moment is expected to be negligible for these large 4@xmath2 orbitals due to the strong crystal field effect . the reduction of local moment from the spin only value of 2  @xmath1 may be attributed to the highly extended nature of the 4@xmath2 orbitals .",
    "in addition , a large degree of o 2@xmath24 - ru 4@xmath2 hybridization is observed in the dos , which may reduce the magnetic moment further .",
    "the shifts in the dos due to exchange splitting are shown in fig .  3 , where the down - spin dos is shown on the same energy scale ( @xmath13-axis ) but the dos - axis is inverted . the relative shift of the up- and down - spin states provides an estimation of the exchange splitting of the corresponding electronic states .",

    "is observed in the case of @xmath19 bands .",
    "smaller splitting in the later cases may be attributed to the larger degree of itineracy of the corresponding electronic states .",
    "interestingly , the tdos at @xmath25 for the up - spin states is found to be significantly smaller ( 1.95 states / ev.fu ) than that ( 3.64 states / ev.fu ) for the down spin states .",

    ", such changes will not have significant influence in the electronic properties of these materials since the @xmath19 bands are essentially empty in both the compounds .    in order to probe the magnetic properties in this system , we calculated the lowest energy eigen states for the ferromagnetic ordering of the spin moments at various sites .",
    "interestingly , the calculations converges to a ferromagnetic ground state with large spin moments at different sites and the lowest energy eigenvalue is slightly ( 4  mev  /fu ) higher than that for the non - magnetic solution .",
    "a recent study@xcite using full potential linearized muffin - tin orbital ( fplmto ) calculations within generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) and spin - orbit coupling shows that caruo@xmath0 exhibit @xmath43-type antiferromagnetic long range order , where all the neighboring ru - sites are antiferromagnetically coupled .",

    "the bands at lower energies represent the bonding electronic states with dominant o 2@xmath24 character and the antibonding levels with large ca 3@xmath2 character shifts to higher energies .",
    "thus , _ the dos in the real structure reveals a large degree of covalency between ca - o(1 ) in the structure , which leads to a shift of o(1 ) sites towards ca - sites ( gdfeo@xmath0 type of distortion)_.@xcite    smaller ionic radius of ca@xmath45 compared to sr@xmath45 leads to a reduction in goldschmidt tolerance factor @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the ionic radius of sr / ca .",
    "such reduction often results to a distortion in the crystal structure .",
    "however , this does not indicate , what kind of distortion is expected . in 3@xmath48 perovskite systems",
    ", it is already shown that although there is no change in the tolerance factor between cavo@xmath0 and latio@xmath0 , a large distortion in the crystal structure is observed.@xcite it was shown that the covalency between a - site cations and o-2@xmath24 states plays the key role in determining the distortion in the crystal structure and that the shift of o(1 ) sites towards a - sites leads to a gdfeo@xmath0-type of distortion in these systems .",
    "a similar effect is also observed here in the electronic structure of these perovskite ruthenates .    in order to understand the magnetic ground state in caruo@xmath0 in the cubic structure ,",
    "we have calculated the lowest eigen energies for the same unit cell .",
    "interestingly , in the cubic structure , the ground state is ferromagnetic , which is about 21  mev  /fu lower in energy than that for non - magnetic solution .",
    "the magnetic moment is found to be significantly large with total spin contribution of 1.2  @xmath1 .",
    "the ru - o bond length in this condition is about 1.92   , which is significantly smaller than that in the real structure ( average bond length  @xmath49  2   ) .",
    "it has been observed that application of pressure leads to a decrease in curie temperature in srruo@xmath0.@xcite this has also been observed in our calculations as well as in the theoretical results published in the past@xcite that ferromagnetic solution becomes less stable with the decrease in unit cell volume leading to a decrease in ru - o - ru bond angle .",
    "thus , _ the observation of ferromagnetic ground state in the cubic structure of caruo@xmath0 clearly reveals an important role of ru - o - ru bond angle in the ground state properties . _    in 3@xmath2 transition metal ( tm )",
    "oxides , it is observed that the tm - o - tm superexchange interaction stabilizes antiferromagnetic ordering for tm - o - tm bond angles of 180@xmath8 .",
    "this is the origin of antiferromagnetic behavior observed in almost all the 3@xmath2 transition metal oxides with insulating ground state . for tm - o - tm bond angle of 90@xmath8 , a ferromagnetic ordering",
    "is expected since the oxygen 2@xmath24 orbitals connected to two neighboring tm sites are orthogonal and the holes transferred from tm sites will be parallel due to hund s rule coupling .",
    "thus , a deviation from 180@xmath8 is expected to help ferromagnetic ordering due to hund s rule effect .",
    "in addition , the deviation of ru - o - ru bond angle from 180@xmath8 is expected to enhance the local magnetic moment of 4@xmath2 electronic states due to the decrease in hopping interactions strength .",
    "thus , _ the destabilization of the long range ferromagnetic order in caruo@xmath0 due to the decrease in ru - o - ru angle from 180@xmath8 is unusual . _",
    "it is to note here that in 3@xmath2 transition metal oxides , the magnetic moment at the transition metal site is often found to be very close to the values corresponding to the ionic configuration@xcite suggesting significantly large localized character of the 3@xmath2 electrons .",
    "however , 4@xmath2 orbitals are highly extended compared to the 3@xmath2 orbitals and the correlation effects are found to be significantly weak.@xcite this is clearly manifested in various magnetic measurements with the estimations of significantly smaller magnetic moment ( close to 1.4  @xmath1 ) compared to the spin - only value of 2  @xmath1 for ru@xmath34 .",
    "the extended nature of the 4@xmath2 electronic states leads to a strong coupling between the local moments centered at different cites .",
    "this is presumably the origin of large degree of spin polarization in the o  2@xmath24 bands ( @xmath50  17% ) and in the interstitial electronic states ( @xmath50  55% ) .",
    "such large spin polarization of the valence electronic states has also been observed in elemental ferromagnets ; 4@xmath51 moments leads to a strong spin polarization in the 5@xmath26@xmath52 valence electrons of gd@xcite and these electronic states couple the local moments at different sites leading to a ferromagnetic long range order .",
    "such coupling is will be weaker in these ruthenates , when the ru - o - ru angle deviates from 180@xmath8 due to the reduction in hopping interaction strength and hence the reduction in extended nature of the valence electrons .",
    "while these arguments provide a qualitative understanding of the magnetic properties in these interesting class of materials , further study is required to probe the details of such interactions in these systems .    in summary ,",
    "the results in these calculations establishes that a - o covalency in the aruo@xmath0 structure plays the key role in determining the electronic structure in these systems .",
    "the absence of long range order in caruo@xmath0 may be attributed to smaller ru - o - ru angle appearing due to large ca - o covalency in this system .",
