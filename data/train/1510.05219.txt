    "the main idea of this approach is to go from the spin- and parity - dependent nld to the total nld at @xmath8 : @xmath102 this equation shows that we need information about the spin and parity distribution around the neutron separation energy .",

    "the fact that in the case of @xmath3ge we know the density of 4@xmath39 and 5@xmath39 states that lie close to the center of the assumed spin distribution , will most probably lead to a good estimation of the full spin distribution .",

    "recent microscopic calculations  @xcite based on the hartree - fock - bogolyuobov ( hfb ) plus combinatorial ( hfb + comb . ) approach have been successful in calculating nlds of a wide range of nuclei .",
