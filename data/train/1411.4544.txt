    "developing a deeper understanding of active matter @xcite has been the major focus of a considerable amount of theoretical work over the last decades @xcite . in recent years",
    ", kinetic theory has gained considerable popularity to assess the ordering behavior in systems of actively propelled particles  @xcite . in this context , the boltzmann equation provides a particularly compelling approach to active matter systems .",
    "apart from its inherent limitations , which are largely due the assumptions of binary particle interactions and molecular chaos ( cf . refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the following advantages of this framework are manifest : ( i ) the structure of the boltzmann equation , relating convection and collision processes on the level of the one - particle distribution function , is ideally suited to explicitly implement a microscopic picture of particle dynamics .",
    "( ii ) due to its mesoscopic character , the boltzmann equation provides an immediate connection to the system s hydrodynamic variables , which naturally arise in the form of the various moments of the one - particle distribution function .",
    "therefore , the boltzmann equation sets up a direct link between the microscopic dynamics of the system s constituent particles and the corresponding physics emerging on hydrodynamic length and time scales .",
    "moreover , since the boltzmann equation keeps track of all parameters used to formulate a particle - level description of the system under study , the resulting hydrodynamics can be studied explicitly in terms of those microscopic parameters .",
    "the boltzmann equation and related kinetic frameworks have been employed in a number of previous studies on two - dimensional systems of self - propelled particles @xcite , mainly to derive a hydrodynamic description . to this end",
    ", an expansion technique is used to derive an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations of motion for the fourier modes of the angular degrees of freedom of the one - particle distribution function . since the zeroth , first , second , and higher order fourier modes are directly related to the local average particle number , polar , nematic , and higher symmetry order parameters , the fourier space description lends itself as a starting point to extract a hydrodynamic description . in general , this is achieved by truncating the hierarchy of fourier space equations by means of a perturbation ansatz for the fourier modes , which itself typically depends on system s symmetries . following a similar strategy , a numerical approach based on an enskog - like kinetic theory has recently been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while such fourier space approaches have been successfully applied to investigate the onset of collective motion , the validity of the underlying truncation schemes remains largely elusive for parameters deeper inside the ordered region .",
    "in this work , we propose a boltzmann equation based approach which we will refer to as _ snake _  ( olving umerically ctive inetic quations ) . _",
    "_  focuses on a direct numerical solution of the boltzmann equation in real space , without any explicit recourse to the aforementioned coupled hierarchy of equations in fourier space .",
    "such a direct numerical approach offers a number of advantages in the study of active systems , which can be summarized as follows .",
    "first of all , the real space boltzmann equation constitutes a closed description for the dynamics of the one - particle distribution function .",
    "consequently , the range of validity of this direct numerical strategy is restricted only by inherent limitations of the boltzmann equation itself but is not principally confined to a parameter region around the onset of collective motion .",
    "secondly , _ snake",
    "_  provides full access to the flexibility of the boltzmann equation in the implementation of specific model systems which are based on a concrete microscopic picture of particle dynamics .",
    "this , thirdly , equips this approach with particularly powerful capabilities to incorporate physical boundary conditions , which can be formulated on the basis of actual particle - wall interactions rather than on the level of macroscopic , hydrodynamic field variables .",
    "finally , since all pertinent hydrodynamic fields are easily computed from the one - particle distribution function by taking appropriate averages , this numerical approach allows to fully exploit the boltzmann equation s potential to mediate between the physics on microscopic and macroscopic scales .    to demonstrate the benefits of _ snake",
    "_ , we will present a detailed study of an archetypical model for active particles subject to binary , polar particle interactions , which has been proposed originally by bertin et al .",
    "@xcite and which we will henceforth refer to as `` bdg model '' . as has been established previously @xcite , the bdg model transitions from a spatially homogeneous , fully isotropic state at low densities / high noise levels to a collectively moving state at high densities / low noise levels . in the vicinity of this phase transition ,",
    "the polar order parameter field was shown to be susceptible to a longitudinal instability @xcite , which in turn has been linked to the emergence of stable solitary wave patterns propagating on an otherwise isotropic low density background @xcite .",
    "well beyond the transition line to collective motion , this longitudinal instability disappears from the boltzmann equation @xcite and a spatially homogeneous state of collective motion has been shown to emerge @xcite .",
    "our work is structured as follows . in section [ sec : discretization ] , we discuss a discretization scheme for the boltzmann equation of self - propelled particles in two spatial dimensions . the central result of this section is an update rule , eq .  , which lends itself to direct numerical implementation",
    "this section also contains a discussion of the general strategy to implement virtually arbitrary boundary conditions and geometries .",
    "readers not interested in the details of the actual discretization procedure underlying the _ snake _  algorithm may skip sections [ sec : dimlessbe ]  [ sec : bcs ] and proceed to section [ sec : applications ] .    there",
    ", we will exploit _ snake _",
    "s capabilities to address the stationary states of the bdg model over a broad range in parameter space ( section [ sec : phasediagram ] ) .",
    "in particular , we will show that our implementation of _ snake _  consistently reproduces previously established analytical results on this model @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : ld_transition ] we focus on the onset of collective motion , which is accompanied by the formation of density segregated patterns and hysteresis effects , as previously reported in numerical studies of the vicsek model @xcite .",
    "additionally , in section [ sec : dsp ] , we extend previous results on the flocking transition in polar systems @xcite well beyond the onset of order .",
    "specifically , we demonstrate the presence of an additional first order phase transition from a spatially inhomogeneous , density segregated phase to a spatially homogeneous polar phase , taking place well inside the ordered , broken - symmetry parameter regime ( section [ sec : hd_transition ] ) .",
    "overall , we find striking similarities between the flocking transition to spatially homogeneous polar order , on the one hand , and the features of liquid - gas phase transitions in equilibrium systems , on the other hand .",
    "analogous observations have been made previously in the context of a lattice model of active ising spins , where a discrete up - down symmetry is spontaneously broken in two spatial dimensions @xcite . in section [ sec : cluster ] , we shift our focus to a deeper discussion of density segregated patterns and report on the emergence of previously unseen `` cluster - lane patterns '' which seem to occupy the same parameter region as the familiar solitary wave patterns and to constitute a stable limit - cycle solution of the underlying boltzmann equation .",
    "these patterns consist of parallel lanes of polar clusters moving in opposite directions ; cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : cluster_particle_currents](b , c ) and figs .",
    "[ fig : cluster_lane_geometry](b , c ) for snapshots .",
    "intriguingly , the stability of such patterns provides a mechanism to establish states of nematic macroscopic order , arising from perfectly polar particle interactions on microscopic scales .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : coasening ] , we investigate the coarsening dynamics for both , wave and cluster lane patterns within the density segregated phase .",
    "section [ sec : outlook ] , then summarizes our numerical approach , discusses our main findings , and gives an outlook of potential applications of _ snake_. in particular , this section gives a comprehensive and self - contained discussion of the most pertinent results established in the more technical sections [ sec : discretization ] and [ sec : applications ] , and can be read independently of these technical parts .",
    "section [ sec : outlook ] has been written to provide the reader with a direct and non - technical accessibility to the core results of this work .",
    "here and in the following , we focus on a kinetic description for two - dimensional systems of actively propelled particles in an over - damped environment . as a simplifying assumption , we consider particles moving at constant speed @xmath0 but variable orientation @xmath1 , such that each particle s velocity vector @xmath2 can be written @xmath3 ( @xmath4 : unit vector ) . for particles with nearly constant propelling forces , this is a reasonable approximation in the `` aristotlean regime '' where the dynamics is governed by a balance between propelling and dissipative forces and inertial effects can be neglected .",
    "moreover , for sufficiently dilute systems , binary particle interactions are believed to dominate over higher order interactions and the spatio - temporal dynamics of the one - particle distribution function @xmath5 can be captured by means of the boltzmann equation  .",
    "the most general form of the boltzmann equation reads    [ eq : boltzmann ] @xmath6.\\ ] ] the density of particles in the phase space element @xmath7\\times[\\theta,\\,\\theta+d\\theta]$ ] is being convected due the particles active propulsion ( left hand side ) , and is , simultaneously , subject to sudden changes due to particle collisions , chemical reactions , etc . which is captured on the right hand side of eq .",
    "in the form of source terms @xmath8 . to make contact to previous works on the boltzmann equation for active systems  @xcite , we consider two separate contributions to the source term , @xmath9 = i_{\\text{sd}}\\left[f;\\,\\theta\\right ] + i_{\\text{c}}\\left[f;\\,\\theta\\right],\\ ] ] which take into account rotational diffusion due to a fluctuating background and / or noisy propelling mechanism , @xmath10 , and binary particle collisions , @xmath11 , respectively .    to be specific , rotational diffusion is implemented using a constant `` tumbling '' rate @xmath12 , and drawing the corresponding angular shifts from a given probability distribution @xmath13 .",
    "the self - diffusion integral @xmath10 then takes the following form ( omitting any explicit reference to space and time coordinates for brevity ) : @xmath14 = \\\\ &",
    "-\\lambda\\,f(\\theta ) +   \\lambda\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}[d\\phi]_{(m)}\\,f(\\phi ) \\ ,",

    ", the two terms on the right hand side quantify the diffusion - related loss and gain of particles in the phase space element @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "to asses the effect of binary particle collisions , we assume that the one - particle distribution function @xmath5 varies on time and length scales which are large compared to the typical time between particle collisions and typical inter - particle separations , respectively . therefore , on the scale of the boltzmann equation  , the impact of collisions on the distribution of angles @xmath1 can be formulated locally in space . to capture the effect of binary collisions , we resort to a collision rule , i.e.  a model - specific mapping @xmath19 between pre- and post - collisional angles : @xmath20 further",
    ", we assume that the collision process is subject to noise , which causes a rotation of the post - collisional angles @xmath21 by some random amount drawn from a probability distribution @xmath22 .",

    "gives the rate at which the phase space element @xmath18 loses particles due to binary collisions .",
    "similarly , the second term quantifies the rate at which particles are scattered into @xmath18 . for the sake of greater generality , we further introduced the parameter @xmath27 $ ] in eq .  , to account for systems with",
    "limited angular interaction ranges @xcite .",
    ".   have been investigated in a number of previous studies  @xcite by mapping the mesoscopic boltzmann equation   to a set of hydrodynamic equations of motion for the first few moments of the one - particle distribution function @xmath5 . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "this mapping is based on a truncation of terms in fourier space representation of the boltzmann equation which itself rests on a perturbation ansatz for the fourier modes around an isotropic base state .",
    "to which extent such an approach yields reliable results in the context of ordered systems remains an open question ; cf .",
    "@xcite . in the following sections ,",
    "we take a different route and focus on a kinetic description for active systems by a direct numerical solution of the boltzmann equation  .",
    "before we derive a discretized version of eqs .  , one last remark is in order : since eqs .   imply @xmath28=0 $ ] , eq .",
    "gives rise to a conservation law for the local particle density @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the local momentum density . in what follows",

    "eq .   then entails conservation of the overall particle density @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the system s two - dimensional spatial domain , and @xmath34 its volume .",
    "we start by rewriting eqs .   in dimensionless form , in order to reduce the number of parameters . to this end , we measure time in units of the self - diffusion time scale @xmath35 , distances in units of the `` ballistic flight length '' @xmath36 , and the one - particle distribution function @xmath37 in units of the ( constant ) overall particle density @xmath38 [ cf .",
    "finally , the phase space factor @xmath39 quantifies the rate particle collisions and is , therefore , proportional to the particle speed @xmath0 and the particle extension @xmath40 .",
    "dimensional analysis then dictates @xmath41 .",
    "we thus arrive at the following convention of units    [ eq : rescalings ] @xmath42    which will be used throughout this work .",
    "the boltzmann equation then takes the dimensionless form @xmath43 + \\rho_0\\,i_{\\text{c}}\\left[f;\\,\\theta\\right].\\ ] ] here the expressions for @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given in eqs .",

    "as an aside we note that in a regime of high densities and / or large ballistic flight lengths with @xmath47 , the characteristic scales introduced above are no longer meaningful . in such cases ,",
    "the characteristic time scale would be set by the typical time between subsequent collisions , @xmath48 , the characteristic length scale by the typical inter - particle distance @xmath49 . in this limit ,",
    "self diffusion can be neglected and the problem becomes independent of the overall particle density .",
    "having established a dimensionless form for the boltzmann equation for active , two - dimensional systems , eq .  , this section is devoted to the derivation of a discretized version of eq .  .",
    "in order to keep the notation compact , we use `` co- and contravariant indices '' such that summation over repeated co- and contravariant index pairs is implied . throughout this work ,",
    "we reserve greek letters for spatial indices , and latin letters for angular indices .",
    "moreover , we use the symbol @xmath50 to denote the measure of spatial domains and angular intervals .    to discretize the spatial domain @xmath33",

    "although a detailed study on the impact of confining geometries on the behavior of active systems lies beyond the scope of our present work , _ snake _  lends itself as a convenient starting point to address this important question . for sample simulations of active polar systems in circular and ring - like confinements",

    "@xcite using mainly analytical methods .",
    "our purpose here is twofold .",
    "first , we can resort to a number of well established analytical results @xcite for this model , as well as a number of previous studies of closely related systems @xcite , to test for the accuracy and reliability of our computational scheme .",
    "secondly , we can use _ snake _  to go beyond the hydrodynamic picture of the onset of collective motion , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and study the nature of the various phases , as well as the ensuing transitions between them .    in the following sections",
    ", we will use the system of units introduced section [ sec : dimlessbe ] ; cf .",
    "moreover , we will use spatial tessellations in the form of regular two - dimensional arrays of @xmath164 rectangular grid sites with linear extensions @xmath165 , and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "some care must be taken for the appropriate choice of the size of one `` boltzmann element '' , @xmath166 : the spatial patterns typically formed by these systems at the onset of polar order , are known to develop rather steep wave fronts , with density profiles varying on length scales comparable to the collision length ( i.e. the typical length a particle travels between successive collisions ) @xcite . to be able to resolve such patterns with sufficient accuracy , we need @xmath167 . in all subsequent sections , we will use densities @xmath168 , such that @xmath169 is an appropriate choice .",
    "unless stated otherwise , @xmath169 and @xmath170 will be used throughout this work .      [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]        and the _ length parameter _ @xmath171 ; cf .",

    "the _ length parameter _ @xmath171 ( columns ) gives the total length of the closed contour representing the cluster lane s midline . ]    here , we will give a brief account of possible cluster lane orientations in systems with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , we will illustrate that the observation rates for cluster lane patterns do strongly depend on cluster lane orientations , and , therefore , explain why only a small number of typical cluster lane orientations is expected to be observed in simulations with finite system sizes .    for the sake of greater clarity , we will consider systems with a @xmath174 aspect ratio .",
    "further , we will use the one - dimensional `` midline '' of each cluster lane [ i.e. the zero of the time averaged particle current inside the _ cluster zone _ ; cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_particle_currents](a ) ] to represent the entire ( two - dimensional ) lane . since clusters moving on different lanes ( and antiparallel directions ) must not collide , each cluster lane on the system s periodic domain @xmath33 must be closed .",
    "this can expressed by requiring @xmath175 where @xmath176 denote the distance along the @xmath177-axis between subsequent intersections of the cluster lane s midline with the lines @xmath178 and @xmath179 , and where @xmath172 and @xmath171 are coprime integers ; cf .",

    "the integers @xmath172 and @xmath171 characterize the topological and geometrical properties of the cluster lane , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_lane_geometry](a ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath172 gives the cluster lane s _ winding number _ in the equatorial plane of the torus representing the periodic domain @xmath33 ; cf . fig .",

    "the _ length parameter _",
    "@xmath171 measures the total length of the cluster lane in units of the ( orientation dependent ) length parameter @xmath183 , where @xmath184 denotes the cluster lane s orientation with respect to the @xmath181-axis .    according to eq .",
    ", the ratio @xmath185 can take on arbitrary rational values . at first sight",
    ", this does not seem to imply a severe restriction , since the set of rational numbers is a dense subset of the real numbers .",
    "in other words , arbitrary cluster lane orientations @xmath186 are `` infinitely close '' to meeting the requirement eq .  . while this is true in the hydrodynamic limit , @xmath187",
    ", finite size effects considerably restrict the number of possible cluster lane orientations @xmath188 . to see this , note that the area @xmath189 each cluster lane of orientation @xmath186 covers on @xmath33",
    "is given by ( @xmath190 : cluster lane s transversal extension ) @xmath191 since the total system size is finite , @xmath192 , and since the minimum number of cluster lanes is @xmath193 ( one cluster lane alone corresponds to a wave pattern ) , we have @xmath194 therefore , noting that the cluster lane width @xmath190 is proportional to the transverse correlation length @xmath195 of the polar order parameter , and that @xmath196 , we get @xmath197    for the system sizes used in our numerical computations , we found @xmath198 .",
    "we , therefore , observe cluster lane patterns characterized by @xmath199 , i.e. @xmath200 , amounting to cluster lane orientations @xmath201 ; cf .",
    "[ fig : cluster_lane_geometry](b , c ) .",
    "this corresponds to the cluster lane geometries indicated in the top left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : winding_number ] . visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : winding_number ] illustrates the rapidly increasing space requirements for cluster lane patterns with increasing values of @xmath172 and @xmath171 .",
    "these space requirements , in turn , directly affect the competition between cluster lane and wave patterns during the pattern selection process : although eq .",
    "has to be fulfilled for any line , representing the lateral extension of a wave pattern , as well , the resulting space requirements [ as captured by eqs .   and ]",
    "are far less restrictive for waves .",
    "more precisely , a single wave band can attain any orientation @xmath188 such that @xmath202 where @xmath203 denotes the longitudinal extension of the wave .",
    "since @xmath204 , eq . is therefore compatible with a much larger set of orientations @xmath188 than eqs .",
    "and ( for finite system sizes @xmath205 ) .",
    "finite system sizes @xmath205 , therefore , imply a bias in favor of the formation of wave patterns .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly explain the numerical protocol used to obtain the data points shown in fig . [",
    "fig : hd_hysteresis ] ( open symbols ) .",
    "special care must be taken to properly assess the location of the density scale @xmath206 , where spatially homogeneous polar ordered states become linearly unstable toward the emergence of density segregated patterns . at the point where the homogeneous system turns linearly unstable ,",
    "the development of spatial heterogeneities out of a virtually homogeneous state is extremely slow . as a sensitive means to detect the buildup of spatial heterogeneities",
    ", we introduce the maximum absolute deviation , @xmath207 for the _ density matrix _ @xmath92 , where @xmath208 this maximum absolute deviation approaches zero for spatially homogeneous systems and attains finite values [ typically of order @xmath209 for states inside the dsp regime .",
    "to estimate the value of @xmath206 , we proceed as follows .",
    "we start from a spatially homogeneous base state , equilibrated at @xmath210 with @xmath211 .",
    "we then quench the overall density @xmath38 to successively lower values and let the system evolve for a time span of at least @xmath212 . had to be run for even longer time",
    "spans up to @xmath213 in order to observe the formation of wave patterns . for @xmath214",
    ", we observed a monotonic but extremely slow increase in @xmath215 . to keep computation times at a tolerable level",
    ", we therefore perturbed the system by setting @xmath216 at @xmath212 ( random variable @xmath217 uniformly distributed on @xmath218 $ ] ) ] during this time , we record the evolution of the quantity @xmath215 . for all data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd_hysteresis ] with @xmath219 , the maximum absolute deviation @xmath215 is a monotonically decreasing function of time , and the system approaches a spatially homogeneous state .",
    "conversely , in systems being represented by data points with @xmath220 , @xmath215 increases such that the spatially homogeneous initial states eventually give rise to density segregated patterns .",
    "as mentioned earlier , for density quenches down to final densities @xmath221 in the vicinity of @xmath206 , the actual buildup of spatial heterogeneities happens on a very large time scale . in actual computations ,",
    "this time scale turns out to be much slower than the local `` equilibration '' of the density matrix @xmath92 toward the new density level @xmath38 .",
    "we , therefore , do not expect that the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd_hysteresis ] should depend on whether they are obtained from a `` quasi - static '' protocol , or a density quench protocol as discussed here .",
