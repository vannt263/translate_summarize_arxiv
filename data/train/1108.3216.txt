    "the hope to develop a quantum information processing machine has made a strong impact in several distinct branches of science , e.g. , in theoretical and experimental quantum physics , in computer science , and in electrical and chemical engineering .",
    "to succeed , it is essential to achieve high - precision quantum transformations , which so far are hindered by two problems : decoherence ( see  @xcite for notation ) and gate control .",
    "while the former can be solved to some extend by proposing new types of less fragile qubits , or implementing decoherence free subspaces  @xcite , the solution to the latter could be the use of adiabatic transformations  @xcite .",
    "such transformations have the advantage that they can be surprisingly robust to various errors of experimental parameters .",
    "this robustness of adiabatic gates , however , comes at the price of a significantly longer gate time , therefore giving the environment more time to destroy coherence . for this reason ,",
    "it is important to understand the interplay of adiabaticity and decoherence , which was studied in several publications in connection to berry s phase  @xcite . in these",
    ", the authors usually postulated a markovian master equation of lindblad form .",
    "however , microscopic derivations of master equations show that its structure crucially depends on the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "therefore , the time dependence of the hamiltonian should be explicitly taken into account when deriving a master equation .",
    "this approach was already taken , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite which studied the pumped charge in a cooper pair sluice , as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite which studied hysteresis in molecular magnets and entanglement of two spin molecules , respectively . in this paper",
    "we are interested both in general properties of decoherence in adiabatic systems as well as in the concrete problem of cooper pair pumping .",
    "we also discuss the applicability of the secular approximation and show that it leads to an incorrect pumped charge despite the fact that this approximation is very well justified if one is interested in the quantum state ( density matrix ) of the system .",
    "we wish to point out that there are two distinct notions of adiabaticity .",
    "first , in the quantum literature one speaks of adiabatic behavior if a closed system approximately follows the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "second , in the thermodynamical literature adiabaticity means that the system follows the instantaneous thermal equilibrium state @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 is the temperature of the environment .",
    "while both situations require a slow change of the hamiltonian , in the quantum case the time scale is set by the eigenfrequencies of the hamiltonian , whereas in the thermodynamic case the energy relaxation time @xmath5 ( often referred to as @xmath6 in the context of qubits ) is the appropriate time scale .",
    "a master equation describing an adiabatically steered quantum system which is coupled to a thermal bath should therefore recover the thermodynamical adiabatic behavior in the respective limit .    if @xmath5 is much longer than the period @xmath7 of a cyclically time ",
    "dependent hamiltonian , then one would expect that in the quantum adiabatic limit , the system approximately follows a mixture of the instantaneous eigenstates @xmath8 ( or more precisely of floquet states  @xcite ) .",
    "after a transient period the coefficients @xmath9 approach constant values @xmath10 which depend on some sort of time  averaged level splittings of the hamiltonian as well as on the temperature @xmath4 of the environment .",
    "this is the limit which was described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , in the other limit , @xmath11 , one expects that after some transient time the system follows the instantaneous thermal state .",
    "the coefficients then satisfy @xmath12 $ ] and hence cyclically depend on time .",
    "our work represents an extension of ref .",

    "we introduce the floquet formalism for cyclic hamiltonians .",
    "we then modify the formalism to separate the fast dynamics which arise from the energy splitting of the hamiltonian from the slow dynamics which are due to the adiabatic time dependence of the hamiltonian .",
    "this procedure directly points to an approximation suitable for adiabatically driven , markovian open quantum systems , which results in a lindblad type master equation , but with time ",
    "dependent lindblad operators .",
    "we find that decoherence is best described in the basis of the time ",
    "dependent floquet states in the sense that in this basis one can differentiate between dephasing ( the environmental influence on the off ",
    "diagonal elements of the density operator ) and relaxation ( diagonal elements ) .",
    "the decoherence rates generally depend on time to guarantee that in the thermodynamical adiabatic limit the system follows the instantaneous thermal state .",
    "it follows that a system coupled to a zero temperature environment does not relax into the instantaneous ground state of the hamiltonian , but into the slightly different floquet ground state .",
    "we apply our theory in two simple examples . in one of these examples , the problem of cooper pair pumping ,",
    "the measurable observable is the transferred ( pumped ) charge .",
    "we show that although the lindblad master equation leads to a very good approximation for the density matrix of the system , it predicts a completely wrong transferred charge . to rectify the problem we refrain from the secular approximation and obtain a suitable master equation which is not of lindblad form .",
    "in this section , we first present some well  known results of the floquet theory  @xcite .",
    "we then modify this theory to allow for a separation of fast oscillations due to the energy of the states from the slow oscillations due to the periodic nature of the hamiltonian .    for a time ",
    "periodic hamiltonian @xmath13 there exist solutions of the schrdinger equation of the form @xmath14 where the floquet modes @xmath15 have the same period as the hamiltonian , and @xmath16 are the quasi energies .",
    "the quasi energies are only uniquely defined up to multiples of @xmath17 with @xmath18 , because @xmath19 for all @xmath20 correspond to the same floquet mode but with a shifted energy .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) because the phase factors in eq .  ( [ 1 ] ) oscillate with constant frequencies @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , if the eigenfrequencies depend on time , as is generally the case , the floquet modes @xmath21 also oscillate rapidly .",
    "a more convenient representation is provided by the states @xmath22 , which differ from the floquet modes only by a time dependent phase factor : @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the instantaneous energy of the floquet mode , and @xmath25 is chosen such that the states @xmath26 are periodic in time .",
    "in fact , it can be easily shown that @xmath27 is the non - adiabatic geometric phase ( aharonov  anandan phase ) @xcite associated with the state @xmath22 .",
    "note that the ambiguity in the quasi energies of the original floquet states is non  existent in the modified floquet states .",
    "therefore , we can now speak of a well defined floquet ground state and floquet excited states .",
    "although the concept of a floquet ground state is not very meaningful if the driving is fast , for adiabatic driving it will turn out to have the same importance as the energy ground state for non  driven systems .",
    "indeed , the floquet ground state approaches the instantaneous ground state in limit of @xmath28 .    in the adiabatic limit",
    ", a system prepared in an energy eigenstate will stay in the respective instantaneous eigenstate . because the eigenstates are cyclic",
    ", they are identical to the modified floquet states in a zeroth order adiabatic approximation . therefore , if the time evolution is adiabatic , the following approximations are valid @xmath29 here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the instantaneous eigenstates and energies of the hamiltonian , respectively , @xmath32 is the adiabatic geometric phase ( berry phase ) , and @xmath33 is the adiabatic parameter .",
    "these modified floquet modes have the useful property to vary only slowly in time , such that the expansion @xmath34 can be restricted to @xmath35 .",

    "that is why we want to have a closer look at the relation of the floquet states to the instantaneous energy eigenstates .",
    "the statement that an adiabatically evolving system follows the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath0 is only correct to zeroth order of the adiabatic parameter .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that if the hamiltonian is an analytic function in time , then the system follows more closely the eigenstates of the operator @xmath36 where we omitted the time dependence of the operators for shorter notation and used a dot to indicate the time derivative .",

    "the smaller the adiabatic parameter , the longer the series improves before it starts to diverge .",
    "if the series does converge , then the system will exactly follow the eigenstates of @xmath43 which are then the exact floquet states .",
    "even if the series does not converge , in an approximation which improves exponentially with the adiabatic parameter , one can use the first few summands of eq .",

    "furthermore , this discussion might also be helpful in understanding the quasi stationary behavior studied below .    in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we consider the system initially in the floquet ground state and we plot the population of the floquet ground state as a function of time for a fairly strong coupling to the dissipative bath for different temperatures .",
    "as predicted in  @xcite , the system does not get excited if the environment has zero temperature ( dotted line ) .",
    "as expected , the higher the temperature , the more populated the floquet excited state becomes , in particular at times when the level splitting is small .    in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we plot the population of the floquet ground state as a function of time for a temperature of about 200  mk and various environmental coupling strengths .",
    "if the coupling is strong ( solid line ) , the system follows the instantaneous thermal mixture of the floquet ground and excited states . for weaker couplings ( dashed and dotted lines )",
    ", the system gets less excited during the short time where the level splitting is small .",
    "furthermore , the short time interval with dissipative coupling [ see fig  [ fig3 ]  ( b ) ] is not sufficient for the system to return to the ground state once the level splitting is large .",
    "ghz and @xmath139 .",
    "[ fig5 ] ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we use even weaker coupling to the environment such that the system needs several pumping cycles to approach a quasi stationary state . as mentioned in section  [ sec3 ] , this quasi stationary state still has time dependent populations of the two floquet states .",

    "[ fig6 ] , we show the time dependence of the population of the floquet ground state for various temperatures . again , at times of a small level splitting the population of the floquet excited state is increased , while at times of a large level splitting the system returns towards the floquet ground state .    in panel",
    "( b ) , we compare the cases of different coupling strengths to the dissipative bath . if the coupling is strong ( solid ) the system closely follows a thermal mixture of the two floquet states according to the instantaneous level splitting . on the contrary , if coupling to the environment is weak ( dotted ) , it barely influence the system s state within one pumping cycle , which leads to a fairly constant population of each floquet state .",
    "this is the limit which is described in ref .",
    "the dashed line represents the intermediate situation .",

    "the similarity of the two panels verifies the accuracy of the secular approximation when being interested in the state of the system .",
    "the small peak of @xmath107 at around @xmath142  ps is responsible for the current and is shown in detail in panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "we see that this peak is altered by the secular approximation , which explains why this approximation should be avoided when calculating the current .",
    "we use @xmath135 and @xmath143  ghz . for clarity",
    ", we use @xmath144 to avoid supercurrent and to expect one transferred cooper pair per cycle ( see main text ) .",
    "indeed , panel  ( a ) predicts 1.00 cooper pairs , while performing the secular approximation [ panel  ( b ) ] leads to the incorrect value of 0.62 transferred cooper pairs .",
    "[ figerror ] ]    the operator of the current through the right josephson junction is given by ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath145 for @xmath146 we obtain @xmath147 .",
    "the expectation value of the current is rather small if the state of the system is close to the ground state and therefore small errors in the density matrix can lead to significant relative errors in the current . in particular , it was argued in  @xcite and discussed in detail in  @xcite that the secular approximation leads to incorrect values for the current and therefore to the non - conservation of charge . in fig .",
    "[ figerror ] we analyze the validity of the secular approximation .",
    "we observe that the secular approximation is very good for the expectation values of all three observables , @xmath107 , @xmath141 , and @xmath90 .",
    "thus the quantum state of the system is well approximated .",
    "however , the small deviations in @xmath148 shown in fig .  [ figerror ] are sufficient to significantly modify the result for the pumped charge , when integrated over long time .",
    "we discuss the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ figerror ] in more detail . to facilitate the qualitative understanding we assume , first , a vanishing residual josephson coupling @xmath144 and a coupling to the environment which is sufficiently strong for the state to closely follow the instantaneous thermal equilibrium .",
    "the temperature is of the order of the minimal energy gap , but much lower than the energy gap at the beginning and the end of each half  cycle [ see panel  ( a ) of fig .  [ fig3 ] ] . at the beginning of the cycle",
    "the system will therefore be in the ground state with no excess cooper pair on the island .",
    "when the system moves through the first avoided level crossing , the energy gap is small enough for the excited state to be populated .",
    "nevertheless , after the first half  cycle is completed , the energy splitting is large again and the system will again be in the ground state , which now has one excess cooper pair on the island . because @xmath149 during the the first half  cycle , this cooper pair came from the left lead . with the same reasoning , the cooper pair leaves the island to the right lead during the second half cycle .",
    "therefore , in this parameter regime we should obtain exactly one transferred cooper pair per pumping cycle , much like in the ground state pumping without coupling to an environment .",
    "indeed , avoiding the secular approximation we obtain exactly one cooper pair per cycle [ panel  ( a ) of fig .  [ figerror ] ] , while performing the secular approximation [ panel  ( b ) ] leads to the incorrect value of 0.62 transferred cooper pairs .",
    "this failure of the secular approximation discussed above is not necessarily connected to the time dependence of the hamiltonian . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider a time independent hamiltonian with @xmath150 and @xmath151 and assume the system to be relaxing from some initial non - equilibrium state to the thermal equilibrium state . in this process",
    "the populations of the excited state and the ground state change in time . since these states have different expectation values of charge on the island , some current must flow .",
    "however , for @xmath150 only off - diagonal elements of the density operator in the energy basis are responsible for current and in the secular approximation the off - diagonal elements are never generated if they were not present in the initial state .",
    "this explains why the secular approximation must fail to take into account contributions to the current which are induced by dissipative effects .    to guarantee the correctness of the transferred charge , in the following we use the master equation eq .",
    "( [ 14a ] ) which was derived without the use of the secular approximation .    in absence of dissipation the pumped charge @xmath152 and the charge transferred due to",

    "our choice of @xmath122 then leads to exactly one pumped cooper pair per cycle , and any deviation from that ideal value is because the finite temperature environment is able to excite the cooper pair sluice .",

    "[ fig7 ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we plot the current in units of cooper pairs per picosecond as a function of time , assuming that the system has already undergone enough cycles to be in the quasi  stationary state . in panel",
    "( a ) we compare different temperatures and we find that as the temperature increases , the current through the sluice decreases .",
    "the reason is , that the floquet  excited state carries supercurrent in the opposite direction to that of the ground state . in panel",
    "( b ) , we compare different coupling strengths to the dissipative bath ( voltage fluctuations ) , and similarly find that the peak current decreases with the coupling strength .",
    "however , the peak width increases with coupling strength such that the total transferred charge per cycle increases with the coupling strength ( see panel  ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . this behavior can be explained qualitatively by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]  ( b ) . at the time of",
    "maximal current , the population of the ground state decreases with growing coupling strength , therefore leading to a decreased peak current .",
    "but at other times , the population of the ground state increases with growing coupling strength , as does therefore the current , resulting in wider current peaks .",
    "panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the total transferred charge per pumping cycle @xmath158 plotted as a function of the coupling strength to the dissipative bath for different temperatures .",
    "again , the charge decreases with temperature , but it slightly increases with @xmath159 .",
    "panel  ( b ) shows the corresponding pumped charge @xmath152 , which is obtained from @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the transferred charge if the pumping cycle is traversed in the opposite direction which changes the sign of the pumped charge but leaves the supercurrent unchanged .",
    "as expected , the pumped charge decreases with temperature .",
    "the dependence on the coupling strength to the environment shows an increase with the growing coupling .",
    "this supports the conclusion of  @xcite that a strong coupling to the environment might be helpful for cooper pair pumping , and can be explained by the fact that at times when the level splitting is large , the system relaxes more effectively to the ground state . as elaborated before for @xmath144 , for one pumped cooper pair per cycle , it is sufficient if the system is in the ground state at the beginning of each half cycle .",
    "we further plotted the transferred charge for @xmath144 which shows that the pumped charge is barely influenced by @xmath162 . for @xmath1636  ghz and strong coupling",
    "the pumped charge does not converge to one cooper pair , but approaches a somewhat lower value .",
    "that is because a higher temperature environment is able to excite the system even at the end of each half cycle when the energy splitting is large .     to the environment for the temperatures @xmath1630  ghz , 2  ghz , 4  ghz , 6  ghz ( from top to bottom )",
    "the residual coupling is @xmath164 .",
    "panel  ( b ) shows the pumped charge per cycle ( solid curves ) , which is calculated from the difference of the total charges obtained by traversing the pumping cycle in opposite directions . for comparison ( blue , dashed curves )",
    "we also show the transferred charge per cycle without residual current @xmath144 , which shows that the pumped charge is barely influenced by the residual coupling @xmath162 .",
    "in conclusion , we have explicitly taken into account the time dependence of an adiabatically and cyclically evolving hamiltonian to develope a master equation which is valid if the environment is markovian .",
    "we found that decoherence takes place in the time dependent floquet basis and that the decoherence rates depend on time through the instantaneous level splittings as well as the instantaneous coupling to the noise .",
    "we first applied our theory to a spin in an adiabatically changing magnetic field , where we found that the spin does not relax into the instantaneous ground state , but the slightly different floquet ground state which is very close to the superadiabatic ground state .",
    "we then tested our theory on the example of the cooper pair sluice , where the time dependence of the decoherence rates is very pronounced .",
    "this results in new features at finite temperatures and modifies the pumped charge which is measurable in current experiments  @xcite .",
    "we further explain why the current has to be calculated without using the secular approximation despite the fact that this approximation is very well justified if one is interested only in the state ( density matrix ) of the system .",
    "there is no consistent terminology in the literature regarding terms like decoherence .",
    "we use the term decoherence to describe all effects induced by an environment .",
    "this includes the decrease of the off  diagonals of the density matrix in the energy basis ( dephasing ) as well as the relaxation of the diagonals towards a steady state ( dissipation , energy relaxation ) ."
