    "<S> the second term comes from the inverse effect of dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction@xcite , which well explains the ferroelectricity in many noncollinear spiral magnets such as @xmath15mno@xmath13@xcite and ni@xmath13v@xmath2o@xmath16@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> however , this mechanism is inactive in the collinear spin system like the present cm4 phase , since the relationship @xmath81 always holds@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests the relevance of spin - orbit coupling to the present em mode ; the relatively weak peak intensity in the im[@xmath47 ] spectrum ( one order of magnitude smaller than that of dymno@xmath13@xcite ) also supports this scenario . since the static @xmath20 in nc(fe ) </S>",
    "<S> is induced by the proper screw magnetic order through the spin - orbit - interaction mediated modulation of fe @xmath82 - o @xmath83 hybridization@xcite , we may anticipate the analogous origin for the presently observed dynamical me coupling in cm4 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the magnetic excitation as depicted in fig . </S>",

    "<S> we further investigated the development of the em mode in static @xmath19 applied along the [ 001 ] direction . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4(d ) indicates the @xmath19-dependence of im[@xmath47 ] spectrum measured at 6 k for the @xmath43 specimen with @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] , where only the em excitation can be observed . as @xmath19 increases </S>",
    "<S> , the em mode is found to split linearly with @xmath19 and form two peak structures . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects the @xmath19-linear splitting of sw branches , which is generally expected for collinear antiferromagnets with @xmath19 applied parallel to the magnetic easy axis . </S>",
    "<S> since the spectral shape of the two - magnon excitation should be independent of @xmath19@xcite , this ensures that the present em mode is excited by the one - magnon process . </S>",
    "<S> the observed evolution of em peak positions under applied @xmath19 is summarized in fig . </S>",

    "<S> et al . _ from the esr study for the @xmath64 specimen@xcite , while they conventionally assigned these modes to afmr driven by @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> our present results imply that the resonance modes found in the previous esr study@xcite is primarily driven by @xmath21-component of incident microwave . </S>",
    "<S> the peak structure observed in im[@xmath47 ] spectrum becomes almost invisible after the transition from cm4 into nc(fe ) at 6.3 t , which confirms the inactivity of em mode in the latter nc phase .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have experimentally revealed the electromagnon excitation in the paraelectric @xmath4 collinear magnetic phase of triangular lattice antiferromagnet cufe@xmath0ga@xmath27o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this mode was found to vanish in the ferroelectric helimagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> these facts prove that neither ferroelectricity nor noncollinear magnetism is a necessary condition for the appearance of electromagnon excitation , while the existing theories on electromagnon have focused on noncollinear magnets like helimagnets . </S>",
    "<S> the anti - correlation between the noncollinear magnetism and the emergence of electromagnon excludes the exchange striction mechanism as the origin of dynamical me coupling : the electric activity of the magnon in this compound is ascribed to the modulation of the @xmath18-@xmath17 hybridization at the spin - twisted excited state via the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> our discovery suggests that similar electromagnon modes will be observable in a wide range of paraelectric collinear magnets . </S>"
