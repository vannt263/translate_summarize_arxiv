    "indeed , atomic systems containing interconnected reservoirs initialized with temperature and chemical potential gradients between the wells have been used to demonstrate behavior analogous to the thermoelectric effect  @xcite and that of a discharging rlc circuit  @xcite . in the quantum domain current can exist even in thermal equilibrium .",

    "though an ideal quantum circuit operates without power input , in reality useful atomtronic circuits , classical or not , will require a power source .",
    "in this work we consider a self - contained power source , which we refer to simply as  a battery \" .",
    "atomtronic batteries have been proposed in open quantum systems comprised of reservoirs with different chemical potentials connected by a lattice  @xcite , as well as a mesoscopic system containing a finite - temperature bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) that sources condensed atoms  @xcite . in this paper ,",

    "[ fig : circuit](a ) is used to quantify fundamental characteristics of an atomtronic battery including the effective terminal voltage , peak power output , and the current and energy capacities .",
    "the system consists of a finite temperature bec with chemical potential @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 prepared in one of the two wells while the other is initially empty .",

    "the dashed portion of the circuit represents the terminator beam as a lumped element that is always impedance matched to the battery internal resistance.,width=325 ]    the battery , serving in its intended role , will typically supply atom current to a load consisting of a collection of circuit devices such as transistors , filtering elements , and so on .",
    "in contrast to an electrical battery driving a circuit operating at low frequency , however , atom coherence properties play a fundamental role in the behavior of the battery - load system . that is , as a source of current , the atomtronic battery is akin to a microwave power source for which the impedance of both source and load act together to determine system behavior . in this paper ,",
    "the load well is illuminated with resonant laser light , which , by removing atoms from the well , eliminates possible reflections of atoms back towards the reservoir . by eliminating such reflections ,",
    "our load is effectively impedance matched to the battery . generally speaking",
    ", impedance matching provides maximum power delivery from the battery",
    ".    it may be useful to comment that at first glance the double - well system depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit](a ) resembles experimental arrangements used to implement atom lasers  @xcite .",
    "in particular , atoms are selectively out coupled from the left - hand reservoir into a magnetic guide where they propagate ballistically .",
    "atom lasers , however , utilize coupling with a bose - einstein condensate to provide , ideally , a source of fully coherent atoms . in our case , the degree of coherence of the out - coupled atoms is determined by the reservoir temperature , while their mean kinetic energy is determined primarily by the output barrier height .",
    "in addition , atom lasers typically utilize weak coupling to the condensate , thereby minimizing back - action of the output on the reservoir .",
    "by contrast , we are very much interested in the evolution of the atom reservoir and show the extent to which it can be described in the context of a conventional electronic battery .    associated with an electronic battery is an internal resistance that dissipates energy as the battery supplies current to a load .",
    "the presence of this internal resistance is fundamental to the action of a battery unlike , say , a capacitor , which can in principle supply current to a load without associated dissipation internal to the capacitor .",
    "similarly , an atomtronic battery must likewise exhibit an internal resistance ; resistance that induces dissipation that can be seen as a consequence of an open quantum system .",
    "an analytical treatment of internal resistance in our double - well system is given in ref .",
    "as is true for the electronic battery , internal resistance determines the maximum power that can be delivered to the load , determines the amount of heat generated internal to the battery , and its energy dissipation causes noise to be injected into the circuit .",
    "operating in the ultracold regime where quantum coherence properties are of interest , heating and noise play a central role ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this study of an atomtronic battery , rather than explicitly analyzing the microscopic physical processes associated with dissipation , dissipative effects are cast in terms of an effective internal resistance within the thvenin equivalent circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit](b ) .    having in mind the picture of a",
    "aa \" battery as the prototype , let us here make some conceptual remarks .",
    "a battery has two terminals : a  + \" and  - \" . if we identify the plus terminal as a source of current , then the second , minus , terminal serves two purposes . on the one hand it defines a voltage reference ( often defined as zero volts ) against which a potential difference is determined , and on the other hand it serves as a current return , which effectively maintains charge neutrality for the circuit as a whole . in our case , the reference potential is somewhat arbitrary , but to be concrete one might choose as the physical plus terminal location to be just to the left of the barrier and the minus terminal just to the right of the barrier of fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit](a ) .",
    "the difference in chemical potential between these two terminals is the battery potential .",
    "however , unlike the electronic case , the minus terminal need not serve as a current return .",

    "the images serve as a rudimentary spectrum analyzer , allowing the longitudinal momentum of the atom current to be extracted from the spatial profile of the atoms at their classical turning point .",

    "this behavior is discussed further in the following sections .",
    "as the battery discharges , only atoms in the high energy tail of the distribution can contribute to the output current ( i.e. , the effects of tunneling are negligible ) .",

    "we model the discharge process with a set of rate equations , and the results are used to characterize the battery in terms of a thvenin equivalent circuit containing a finite internal resistance .",
    "the internal resistance is found to be negative , which results in a decrease in temperature and sustained chemical potential as the battery supplies current to the load .",
    "this behavior is complementary to that of the atomtronic battery described in ref .",

    "the chemical potential stored in the reservoir well was shown to remain nearly constant throughout the discharge , which reflects its role as the analogue to the electromotive force .",
    "binary collisions attempt to maintain local thermal equilibrium in the reservoir well and repopulate atoms at the terminal voltage , which leads to sustained current output .",
