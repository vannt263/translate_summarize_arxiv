    "covariant phase space ( cps ) is the solution space of a system of euler  lagrange partial differential equations ( pdes )",
    ". it has been first noticed by zuckerman in the 1986 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that there is a canonical , closed @xmath1form @xmath0 on such a functional space generalizes the symplectic form on the phase space of a regular lagrangian system in mechanics .",
    "moreover , the degeneracy distribution of @xmath0 is naturally interpreted as lie algebra of gauge transformations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cps is , in principle , a nice environment to perform a covariant ( canonical ) quantization of a lagrangian theory .",
    "namely , gauge invariant functions on the cps possess a well defined lie bracket induced by @xmath0 , which has been proved in @xcite to coincide with the so  called peierls bracket @xcite . in turn",
    ", peierls bracket is at the basis of the global approach to quantum field theory @xcite .    despite its conceptual relevance ,",
    "the cps is , in general , a complicated functional space , which is difficult to handle with analytic methods .",
    "indeed , most of the literature about it ( see @xcite and references therein ) comes from the physicists community and it is rarely completely rigorous from a mathematical point of view .",
    "for instance , it seems to be very hard to rigorously perform , in full generality , a symplectic reduction of the cps to get rid of gauge ( non  physical ) degrees of freedom .    on the other hand ,",
    "a.  m.  vinogradov developed a whole theory , the so  called _ secondary calculus _",
    "( see @xcite and references therein , and @xcite for a short introduction ) , which properly formalizes in cohomological terms the idea of a ( local ) functional differential calculus on the space of solutions of a generic system of pdes ( for this reason , roughly speaking , the word secondary  in this paper could be considered as a synonym of functional ) .",
    "thus , secondary calculus appears to be a suitable setting to rigorously investigate the cps and its properties .",
    "the aim of the paper is to describe rigorously the cps , its canonical @xmath1form and some their properties within secondary calculus . as a byproduct",
    "it will become transparent the analogy between the cps and the phase space of constrained mechanical systems .",
    "the paper is divided into two parts . in order to make it as self  consistent as possible we review , in the first part , those aspects of secondary calculus that are needed for a suitable formalization of the cps . in sections",
    "[ sec1 ] , [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] we briefly describe the geometry and the main properties of jet spaces and differential equations , and relevant structures on them . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we define secondary vector fields and differential forms , and summarize the main formulas of first order secondary calculus . in sections [ horcalc ] and [ spencgold ] we review the main technical aspects of secondary calculus and how to handle the relevant cohomologies .",
    "the second part of the paper is devoted to the cps and to original results on the subject . in section [ sec7 ]",
    "we introduce the cps for a general lagrangian field theory ( any number of variable and any order ) and rederive the existence of a canonical @xmath1form @xmath0 on it completing the proof by zuckerman @xcite . in section [ sec8 ]",
    "we propose a symplectic version  of the first noether theorem , which makes it evident the analogy with hamiltonian mechanics . in section [ sec9 ]",
    "we describe the degeneracy distribution of @xmath0 and propose , and motivate , a new ( and very natural ) definition of ( infinitesimal ) gauge symmetries in field theory . in section [ sec10 ]",
    "we describe gauge invariant secondary functions on the cps and show that they are endowed with a canonical lie bracket ( such bracket formalizes rigorously the peierls bracket @xcite ) . in section [ sec11 ]",
    "we outline a possible path through a secondary symplectic reduction  of the cps .",
    "applications to concrete lagrangian theories will be presented somewhere else .",
    "most of the ( almost ) trivial computations will be performed in some details to emphasize similarities between secondary calculus and standard calculus on manifolds .      in this section",
