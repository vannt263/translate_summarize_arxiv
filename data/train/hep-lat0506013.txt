    "the scattering of two pions at low energies is the simplest of all dynamical strong - interaction processes from the theoretical standpoint .",
    "as pions are the pseudo - goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , their low - momentum interactions are constrained by the approximate chiral symmetries of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and the scattering lengths for @xmath10 in the s - wave are uniquely predicted at leading order in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath11-pt ) .",
    "higher orders in the chiral expansion give contributions to these scattering lengths that are suppressed by powers of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the mass of the pion , and @xmath14 is the scale of chiral symmetry breaking . however , part of these higher - order contributions are from local counterterms with coefficients that are not constrained by chiral symmetry alone .",
    "lattice qcd is the only known technique with which one can rigorously calculate these strong - interaction quantities .",
    "a lattice calculation of the @xmath1 scattering length as a function of the light - quark masses , @xmath15 , will allow the determination of the relevant counterterms that appear in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "of course , this is only true for values of @xmath13 within the chiral regime where @xmath16 .",
    "even though it is likely that in the future lattice calculations will be performed at the physical values of the light - quark masses , and while a chiral extrapolation of observables will not be necessary , the values of the counterterms will be essential as the chiral lagrangian will still be used to compute more - complex strong - interaction processes that are too costly to compute directly on the lattice .",
    "a second important motivation for studying @xmath1 scattering with lattice qcd is its impact upon weak - interaction processes ( and physics beyond the standard model ) , such as @xmath17 , and the determination of fundamental constants of nature associated with electroweak physics , such as cp violation in the standard model .",
    "lattice qcd calculations are performed on a euclidean lattice , and the maiani - testa theorem demonstrates that s - matrix elements can not be determined from @xmath18-point green s functions computed on the lattice at infinite volume , except at kinematic thresholds  @xcite .",
    "however , lscher has shown that by computing the energy levels of two - particle states in the finite - volume lattice , the @xmath19 scattering amplitude can be recovered  @xcite .",
    "the energy levels of the two interacting particles are found to deviate from those of two non - interacting particles by an amount that depends on the scattering amplitude and varies inversely with the lattice spatial volume .",
    "a number of lattice qcd calculations of @xmath1 scattering in the @xmath0 channel have been performed previously using lscher s method . for obvious reasons ,",
    "calculations were initially performed in quenched qcd  @xcite but in a recent tour - de - force study , the cp - pacs collaboration exploited the finite - volume strategy to study @xmath0 , s - wave @xmath1 scattering in fully - dynamical lattice qcd with two flavors of improved wilson fermions  @xcite , with pion masses in the range @xmath20 .",
    "a lattice qcd calculation of @xmath1 scattering should fulfill several conditions : ( i ) quark masses small enough to lie within the chiral regime so that the extrapolation to the physical point is reliable , ( ii ) a lattice volume large enough to avoid finite - volume effects from pions `` going around the world '' but small enough for the energy shifts to be measurable and ( iii ) a lattice spacing small enough so that discretization effects are under control . based on these requirements",
    "we have performed a fully - dynamical lattice qcd calculation with two degenerate light quarks and a strange quark ( 2 + 1 ) with pion masses in the chiral regime , @xmath21 ( 319 configurations ) , @xmath22 ( 649 configurations ) and @xmath4 ( 453 configurations ) .",
    "the configurations we have used are the publicly - available milc lattices with dynamical staggered fermions of spatial dimension @xmath23 , and we have used domain - wall  @xcite propagators generated by lhpc   at the thomas jefferson national laboratory ( jlab ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : finvol ] we discuss lscher s finite - volume method for extracting hadron - hadron scattering parameters from energy levels calculated on the lattice . in section  [ sec : calcdet ] we describe the details of our mixed - action lattice qcd calculation .",
    "we also discuss the relevant correlation functions and outline our fitting procedures . in section",
    "[ sec : matching ] we present the results of our lattice calculation , and the analysis of the lattice data with @xmath11-pt . in section  [ sec : resdisc ]",
    "we conclude .",
    "the s - wave scattering amplitude for two particles below inelastic thresholds can be determined using lscher s method  @xcite , which entails a measurement of one or more energy levels of the two - particle system in a finite volume . for two particles of identical mass , @xmath24 , in an s - wave , with zero total three momentum , and in a finite volume , the difference between the energy levels and those of two non - interacting particles can be related to the inverse scattering amplitude via the eigenvalue equation  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the elastic - scattering phase shift , and the regulated three - dimensional sum is @xmath27 the sum in eq .",
