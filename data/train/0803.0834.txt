    "what is all the fuss about noise ? in this review we endeavor to convey the excitement and promise of studies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation to scientists not engaged in these studies , particularly to particle and nuclear physicists .",
    "although the techniques for both detection and data processing are quite far apart from those familiar to our intended audience , the science goals are aligned .",
    "we do not emphasize mathematical rigor , but rather attempt to provide insight into ( a ) the processes that allow extraction of fundamental physics from the observed radiation patterns and ( b ) some of the most fruitful methods of detection .    in section 1 ,",
    "we begin with a broad outline of the most relevant physics that can be addressed with the cmb and its polarization .",
    "we then treat the early history of the field , how the cmb and its polarization are described , the physics behind the acoustic peaks , and the cosmological physics that comes from cmb studies .",
    "section  2 presents the important foreground problem : primarily galactic sources of microwave radiation .",
    "the third section treats detection techniques used to study these extremely faint signals .",
    "the promise ( and challenges ) of future studies is presented in the last two sections . in keeping with our purposes",
    ", we do not cite an exhaustive list of the ever expanding literature on the subject , but rather indicate several particularly pedagogical works .      here",
    "we briely review the now standard framework in which cosmologists work and for which there is abundant evidence .",
    "we recommend readers to the excellent book modern cosmology by dodelson ( 2 ) . early in its history",
    "( picoseconds after the big bang ) , the energy density of the universe was divided among matter , radiation , and dark energy . the matter sector",
    "consisted of all known elementary particles and included a dominant component of dark matter , stable particles with negligible electromagnetic interactions .",
    "photons and neutrinos ( together with the kinetic energies of particles ) comprised the radiation energy density , and the dark energy component some sort of fluid with a negative pressure appears to have had no importance in the early universe , although it is responsible for its acceleration today .",
    "matter and radiation were in thermal equilibrium , and their combined energy density drove the expansion of space , as described by general relativity . as the universe expanded , wavelengths were stretched so that particle energies ( and hence the temperature of the universe ) decreased : t(@xmath0 ) = t(0)(1 + @xmath0 ) , where @xmath0 is the redshift and t(0 ) is the temperature at @xmath0 = 0 , or today .",
    "there were slight overdensities in the initial conditions that , throughout the expansion , grew through gravitational instability , eventually forming the structure we observe in todays universe : myriad stars , galaxies , and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the universe was initially radiation dominated .",
    "most of its energy density was in photons , neutrinos , and kinetic motion . after the universe cooled to the point at which the energy in rest mass equaled that in kinetic motion ( matter - radiation equality ) , the expansion rate slowed and the universe became matter dominated , with most of its energy tied up in the masses of slowly moving , relatively heavy stable particles : the proton and deuteron from the baryon sector and the dark matter particle(s ) .",
    "the next important era is termed either decoupling , recombination , or last scattering .",
    "when the temperature reached roughly 1 ev , atoms ( mostly h ) formed and the radiation cooled too much to ionize .",
    "the universe became transparent , and it was during this era that the cmb we see today was emitted , when physical separations were 1000 times smaller than today ( @xmath11000 ) .",
    "at this point , less than one million years into the expansion , when electromagnetic radiation ceased playing an important dynamical role , baryonic matter began to collapse and cool , eventually forming the first stars and galaxies .",
    "later , the first generation of stars and possibly supernova explosions seem to have provided enough radiation to completely reionize the universe ( at @xmath2 ) . throughout these stages ,",
    "the expansion was decelerated by the gravitational force on the expanding matter .",
    "now we are in an era of cosmic acceleration ( @xmath32 ) , where we find that approximately 70% of the energy density is in the fluid that causes the acceleration , 25% is in dark matter , and just 5% is in baryons , with a negligible amount in radiation .",
    "the cmb is a record of the state of the universe at a fraction of a million years after the big bang , after a quite turbulent beginning , so it is not immediately obvious that any important information survives . certainly the fundamental information available in the collisions of elementary particles is best unraveled by observations within nanoseconds of the collision . yet even in this remnant radiation lies the imprint of fundamental features of the universe at its earliest moments .",
    "one of the most important features of the cmb is its planck spectrum .",
    "it follows the blackbody curve to extremely high precision , over a factor of approximately 1000 in frequency ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "this implies that the universe was in thermal equilibrium when the radiation was released ( actually long before , as we see below ) , which was at a temperature of approximately 3000 k. today it is near 3 k.    an even more important feature is that , to better than a part in 10@xmath4 , this temperature is the same over the entire sky .",
    "this is surprising because it strongly implies that everything in the observable universe was in thermal equilibrium at one time in its evolution . yet at any time and place in the expansion history of the universe , there is a causal horizon defined by the distance light ( or gravity ) has traveled since the big bang ; at the decoupling era , this horizon corresponded to an angular scale of approximately 1@xmath5 , as observed today .",
    "the uniformity of the cmb on scales well above 1@xmath5 is termed the horizon problem .",
    "the most important feature is that there are differences in the cmb temperature from place to place , at the level of 10@xmath6 , and that these fluctuations have coherence beyond the horizon at the time of last scattering .",
    "the most viable notion put forth to address these observations is the inflationary paradigm , which postulates a very early period of extremely rapid expansion of the universe .",
    "its scale factor increased by approximately 21 orders of magnitude in only approximately 10@xmath7 s. before inflation , the small patch that evolves into our observable universe was likely no larger across than the planck length , its contents in causal contact and local thermodynamic equilibrium . the process of superluminal inflation disconnects regions formally in causal contact .",
    "when the expansion slowed , these regions came back into the horizon and their initial coherence became manifest .",
    "the expansion turns quantum fluctuations into ( nearly ) scale - invariant cmb inhomogeneities , meaning that the fluctuation power is nearly the same for all threedimensional fourier modes .",
    "so far , observations agree with the paradigm , and scientists in the field use it to organize all the measurements .",
    "nevertheless , we are far from understanding the microphysics driving inflation .",
    "the number of models and their associated parameter spaces greatly exceed the number of relevant observables .",
    "new observations , particularly of the cmb polarization , promise a more direct look at inflationary physics , moving our understanding from essentially kinematical to dynamical .      for particle physicists , probing microphysics at energy scales beyond accelerators using cosmological observations",
    "is attractive .",
    "the physics of inflation may be associated with the grand unifcation scale , and if so , there could be an observable signature in the cmb : gravity waves .",
    "metric perturbations , or gravity waves ( also termed tensor modes ) , would have been created during inflation , in addition to the density perturbations ( scalar modes ) that give rise to the structure in the universe today .    in the simplest of inflationary models",
    ", there is a direct relation between the energy scale of inflation and the strength of these gravity waves .",
    "the notion is that the universe initially had all its energy in a scalar field @xmath9 displaced from the minimum of its potential @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is suitably constructed so that slowly rolls down its potential , beginning the inflationary era of the universe , which terminates only when @xmath9 approaches its minimum .",
    "inflation does not predict the level of the tensor ( or even scalar ) modes .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is the tensor - to - scalar ratio for fluctuation power ; it depends on the energy scale at which inflation began . specifically , the initial height of the potential @xmath13 depends on @xmath14 , as @xmath15 .",
    "a value of @xmath16 , perhaps the smallest detectable level , corresponds to @xmath17 .",
    "the tensor modes leave distinct patterns on the polarization of the cmb , which may be detectable .",
    "this is now the most important target for future experiments .",
    "they also have effects on the temperature anisotropies , which currently limit @xmath14 to less than approximately 0.3 .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that even a slight neutrino mass affects the expansion of the universe .",
    "when the dominant dark matter clusters , it provides the environment for baryonic matter to collapse , cool , and form galaxies . as described above , the growth of these structures becomes more rapid in the matter - dominated era . if a significant fraction of the dark matter were in the form of neutrinos with electron - volt - scale masses ( nonrelativistic today ) , these would have been relativistic late enough in the expansion history that they could have moved away from overdense regions and suppressed structure growth .",
    "such suppression alters the cmb patterns and provides some sensitivity to the sum of the neutrino masses .",
    "note also that gravitational effects on the cmb in its passage from the epoch ( or surface ) of last scattering to the present leave signatures of that structure and give an additional ( and potentially more sensitive ) handle on the neutrino masses ( see section 1.9.2 ) .",
    "we know from the cmb that the geometry of the universe is consistent with being flat .",
    "that is , its density is consistent with the critical density .",
    "however , the overall density of matter and radiation discerned today ( the latter from the cmb directly ) falls short of accounting for the critical density by approximately a factor of three , with little uncertainty .",
    "thus , the cmb provides indirect evidence for dark energy , corroborating supernova studies that indicate a new era of acceleration . because the presence and possible evolution of a dark energy component alter the expansion history of the universe",
    ", there is the promise of learning more about this mysterious component .      in 1965 ,",
    "penzias and wilson ( 3 ) , in trying to understand a nasty noise source in their experiment to study galactic radio emission , discovered the cmb arguably the most important discovery in all the physical sciences in the twentieth century .",
    "shortly thereafter , scientists showed that the radiation was not from radio galaxies or reemission of starlight as thermal radiation .",
    "this first measurement was made at a central wavelength of 7.35 cm , far from the blackbody peak .",
    "the reported temperature was @xmath18 .",
    "however , for a blackbody , the absolute flux at any known frequency determines its temperature .",
    "figure  1 shows the spectrum of detected radiation for different temperatures . there is a linear increase in the peak position and in the flux at low frequencies ( the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum ) as temperature increases .     ]",
    "multiple efforts were soon mounted to confirm the blackbody nature of the cmb and to search for its anisotropies .",
    "partridge ( 4 ) gives a very valuable account of the early history of the field .",
    "however , there were false observations , which was not surprising given the low ratio of signal to noise . measurements of the absolute cmb temperature are at milli - kelvin levels , whereas relative measurements between two places on the sky are at micro - kelvin levels . by 1967 , partridge and wilkinson had shown , over large regions of the sky , that @xmath19 , leading to the conclusion that the universe was in thermal equilibrium at the time of decoupling ( 4 ) .",
    "however , nonthermal injections of energy even at much earlier times , for example , from the decays of long - lived relic particles , would distort the spectrum .",
    "it is remarkable that current precise measurements of the blackbody spectrum can push back the time of significant injections of energy to when the universe was barely a month old ( 5 ) .",
    "thus , recent models that attribute the dark matter to gravitinos as decay products of long - lived supersymmetric weakly interacting massive particles ( susy wimps ) ( 6 ) can only tolerate lifetimes of less than approximately one month .",
    "the solar system moves with velocity @xmath20 , causing a dipole anisotropy of a few milli - kelvins , first detected in the 1980s .",
    "( note that the direction of our motion was not the one initially hypothesized from motions of our local group of galaxies . )",
    "the first detection of primordial anisotropy came from the cobe satellite ( 7 ) in 1992 , at the level of 10@xmath6 ( 30 @xmath21k ) , on scales of approximately 10@xmath5 and larger .",
    "the impact of this detection matched that of the initial discovery .",
    "it supported the idea that structure in the universe came from gravitational instability to overdensities .",
    "the observed anisotropies are a combination of the original ones at the time of decoupling and the subsequent gravitational red- or blueshifting as photons leave over- or underdense regions .      here",
    "we describe the usual techniques for characterizing the temperature field .",
    "first , we define the normalized temperature @xmath22 in direction @xmath23 on the celestial sphere by the deviation @xmath24 from the average : @xmath25 .",
    "next , we consider the multipole decomposition of this temperature field in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath26 : @xmath27 where the integral is over the entire sphere .    if the sky temperature field arises from gaussian random fluctuations , then the field is fully characterized by its power spectrum @xmath28 .",
    "the order @xmath29 describes the angular orientation of a fluctuation mode , but the degree ( or multipole ) @xmath30 describes its characteristic angular size .",
    "thus , in a universe with no preferred direction , we expect the power spectrum to be independent of @xmath29 .",
    "finally , we define the angular power spectrum @xmath31 by @xmath32 . here",
    "the brackets denote an ensemble average over skies with the same cosmology .",
    "the best estimate of @xmath31 is then from the average over m.    because there are only the ( @xmath33 ) modes with which to detect the power at multipole @xmath30 , there is a fundamental limit in determining the power .",
    "this is known as the cosmic variance ( just the variance on the variance from a finite number of samples ) : @xmath34 the full uncertainty in the power in a given multipole degrades from instrumental noise , finite beam resolution , and observing over a finite fraction of the full sky , as shown below in equation 9 .    for historical reasons ,",
    "the quantity that is usually plotted , sometimes termed the tt ( temperature - temperature correlation ) spectrum , is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the blackbody temperature of the cmb .",
    "this is the variance ( or power ) per logarithmic interval in @xmath30 and is expected to be ( nearly ) uniform in inflationary models ( scale invariant ) over much of the spectrum .",
    "this normalization is useful in calculating the contributions to the fluctuations in the temperature in a given pixel from a range of @xmath30 values : @xmath37     data from other experiments are shown , in addition to the best - fit cosmological model to the wmap data alone .",
    "note the multipole scale on the bottom and the angular scale on the top .",
    "figure courtesy of the wmap science team[wmap - ps ] ]      figure 2 shows the current understanding of the temperature power spectrum ( from herewith we redefine @xmath31 to have @xmath38 units by replacing @xmath31 with @xmath39 ) .",
    "the region below @xmath40 indicates the initial conditions .",
    "these modes correspond to fourier modes at the time of decoupling , with wavelengths longer than the horizon scale .",
    "note that were the sky describable by random white noise , the @xmath31 spectrum would be flat and the tt power spectrum , defined by equation 3 , would have risen in this region like @xmath41 .",
    "the ( pleasant ) surprise was the observation of finite power at these superhorizon scales . at high @xmath30 values , there are acoustic oscillations , which are damped at even higher @xmath30 values .",
    "the positions and heights of the acoustic - oscillation peaks reveal fundamental properties about the geometry and composition of the universe , as we discuss below .",
    "the cmb data reveal that the initial inhomogeneities in the universe were small , with overdensities and underdensities in the dark matter , protons , electrons , neutrinos , and photons , each having the distribution that would arise from a small adiabatic compression or expansion of their admixture .",
    "an overdense region grows by attracting more mass , but only after the entire region is in causal contact .",
    "we noted that the horizon at decoupling corresponds today to approximately 1@xmath5 on the sky .",
    "only regions smaller than this had time to compress before decoupling . for sufficiently small regions , enough time elapses",
    "that compression continues until the photon pressure is sufficient to halt the the electrons via thomson scattering , and the protons follow the electrons to keep a charge balance .",
    "inflation provides the initial conditions - zero velocity .",
    "decoupling preserves a snapshot of the state of the photon fluid at that time .",
    "excellent pedagogical descriptions of the oscillations can be found at _",

    "extrema in the density field result in maxima in the power spectrum .",
    "consider a standing wave permeating space with frequency @xmath43 and wave number @xmath44 , where these are related by the velocity of displacements ( the sound speed , @xmath45 ) in the plasma : @xmath46 .",
    "the wave displacement @xmath47 for this single mode can then be written as @xmath48 .",
    "the displacement is maximal at time @xmath49 of decoupling for @xmath50 we add the tt subscript to label these wave numbers associated with maximal autocorrelation in the temperature .",
    "note that even in this tightly coupled regime , the universe at decoupling was quite dilute , with a physical density of less than @xmath51 . because the photons diffuse their mean free path is not infinitely short this pattern does not go on without bound .",
    "the overtones are damped , and in practice only five or six such peaks will be observed , as seen in figure  2 .      to help explain these ideas , we reproduce a few frames from an animation by w. hu .",
    "figure 3 shows a density fluctuation on the sky from a single @xmath44 mode and how it appears to an observer at different times .",
    "the figure shows the particle horizon just after decoupling .",
    "this represents the farthest distance one could in principle see approximately the speed of light times the age of the universe .",
    "an observer at the center of the gure could not by any means have knowledge of anything outside this region .",
    "of course , just after decoupling , the observer could see a far shorter distance .",
    "only then could light propagate freely .",
    "the subsequent frames show how the particle horizon grows to encompass more corrugations of the original density fluctuation . at first",
    "the observer sees a dipole , later a quadrupole , then an octopole , and so on , until the present time when that single mode in density inhomogeneities creates very high multipoles in the temperature anisotropy .",
    "it is instructive to think of how the temperature observed today at a spot on the sky arises from the local moments in the temperature field at the time of last scattering .",
    "it is only the lowest three moments that contribute to determining the anisotropies .",
    "the monopole terms are the ones transformed into the rich angular spectra .",
    "the dipole terms also have their contribution : the motion in the fluid oscillations results in doppler shifts in the observed temperatures .",
    "polarization , we see below , comes from local quadrupoles .",
    "these frames show one superhorizon temperature mode just after decoupling with representative photons last scattering and heading toward the observer at the center .",
    "left to right : just after decoupling ; the observer s particle horizon when only the temperature monopole can be detected ; som e time later when the quadrupole is detected ; later still when the 12-pole is detected ; and today , a very high , well aligned multipole , from just this single mode in @xmath44-space , is detected .",
    "figure courtesy of w. hu [ hu-1 ]      inflation is a mechanism whereby fluctuations are created without violating causality .",
    "there does not seem to be a better explanation for the observed regularities .",
    "nevertheless , wolfgang pauli s famous statement about the neutrino comes to mind : i have done a terrible thing : i have postulated a particle that can not be detected !    sometimes it seems that inflation is an idea that can not be tested , or tested incisively .",
    "of course pauli s neutrino hypothesis did test positive , and similarly there is hope that the idea of inflation can reach the same footing . still , we have not ( yet ) seen any scalar field in nature .",
    "we discuss what has been claimed as the smoking gun test of inflation the eventual detection of gravity waves in the cmb .",
    "however , will we ever know with certainty that the universe grew in volume by a factor of 10@xmath52 in something like @xmath53 ?      experiments have now shown that the cmb is polarized , as expected .",
    "researchers now think that the most fruitful avenue to fundamental physics from the cmb will be in precise studies of the patterns of the polarization .",
    "this section treats the mechanisms responsible for the generation of the polarization and how this polarization is described .",

    "frames courtesy of w. hu.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the quadrupole is generated during decoupling , as shown in figure 3 . because the polarization arises from scattering but said scattering dilutes the quadrupole , the polarization anisotropy is much weaker than that in the temperature field .",
    "indeed with each scatter on the way to equilibrium , the polarization is reduced .",
    "any remaining polarization is a direct result of the cessation of scattering . for this reason , the polarization peaks at higher @xmath30 values than does the temperature anisotropy .",
    "the local quadrupole on scales that are large in comparison to the mean free path is diluted from multiple scattering .",
    "the polarization field is both more complicated and richer than the temperature field . at each point in the sky",
    ", one must specify both the degree of polarization and the preferred direction of the electric field .",
    "this is a tensor field that can be decomposed into two types , termed e and b , which are , respectively , scalar and pseudoscalar fields , with associated power spectra .",
    "examples of these polarization fields are depicted schematically in figure  4 .",
    "the e and b fields are more fundamental than the polarization field on the sky , whose description is coordinate - system dependent .",
    "in addition , e modes arise from the density perturbations ( which do not produce b modes ) that we describe , whereas the b modes come from the tensor distortions to the space - time metric ( which do have a handedness ) .",
    "we mention here that the e and b fields are nonlocal .",
    "their extraction from measurements of polarization over a set of pixels , often in a finite patch of sky , is a well - developed but subtle procedure ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the peaks in the ee ( e - polarization correlated with itself ) spectrum should be 180 out of phase with those for temperature : polarization results from scattering and thus is maximal when the fluid velocity is maximal . calculating the fluid velocity for the mode in section 1.6",
    ", we find @xmath58 , defining modes with maximal ee power .",
    "the te ( e - polarization correlated with the temperature field ) spectrum how modes in temperature correlate with those with e polarization is also of cosmological interest , with its own peak structure .",
    "here we are looking at modes that have a maximum at decoupling in the product of their temperature and e - mode polarization ( or velocity ) .",
    "similarly , the appropriate maxima ( which in this case can be positive or negative ) are obtained when @xmath59 thus , between every peak in the tt power spectrum there should be one in the ee , and between every tt and ee pair of peaks there should be one in the te .",
    "figure 5 shows the ee results in addition to the expected power spectra in the standard cosmological model .",
    "measurements of the te cross correlation are also shown .",
    "the pattern of peaks in both power spectra is consistent with what was expected .",
    "what was unexpected was the enhancement at the lowest @xmath30 values in the ee power spectrum .",
    "this is discussed in the next section .",
    "the experiments reported in figure  5 , with 20 or fewer detectors , use a variety of techniques and operate in different frequency ranges .",
    "this is important in dealing with astrophysical foregrounds ( see section 2 ) that have a different frequency dependence from that of the cmb .     and that to display features in the very low @xmath30 range , we plot @xmath60.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and that to display features in the very low @xmath30 range , we plot @xmath60.,title=\"fig : \" ]    limits from current experiments on the b - mode power are now at the level of 1 - 10 @xmath61 , far from the expected signal levels shown in figure 6 .",
    "the peak in the power spectrum ( for the gravity waves ) is at @xmath62 , the horizon scale at decoupling .",
    "the reader may wonder why the b modes fall off steeply above this scale and show no acoustic oscillations .",
    "the reason is simple : a tensor mode will give , for example , a compression in the x - direction followed by a rarefaction in the y - direction , but will not produce a net overdensity that would subsequently contract . in the final section",
    "we discuss experiments with far greater numbers of detectors aimed specifically at b - mode science .",
    "note that such gravity waves have frequencies today of order @xmath63  hz .",
    "however , if their spectrum approximates one of scale invariance , they would in principle be detectable at frequencies nearer 1 hz , such as in the lisa experiment .",
    "this is discussed more fully in reference 10 .      in this section",
    "we briefly discuss three important processes after decoupling : rescattering of the cmb in the reionized plasma of the universe , lensing of the cmb through gravitational interactions with matter , and scattering of the cmb from hot gas in galaxy clusters .",
    "although these can be considered foregrounds perturbing the primordial information , each can potentially provide fundamental information .     and @xmath64 . the predicted b - mode signal power spectrum due to the distortion of e modes by weak gravitational lensing is also shown .",
    "estimated statistical sensitivities for a new space mission ( pink line ) and two sample ground - based experiments , as considered in reference 9 , each with 1000 detectors operating for one year with 100% duty cycle ( dark and light blue lines ) , are shown .",
    "experiment i observes 4% of the sky , with a 6-arcmin resolution ; experiment ii observes 0.4% of the sky , with a 1-arcmin resolution . ]      the enhancement in the ee power spectrum at the very lowest @xmath30 values in figure 5 is the signature that the universe was reionized after decoupling .",
    "this is a subject rich in astrophysics , but for our purposes it is important in that it provides another source for scattering and hence detection of polarization . from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) polarization data ( 11 ) , one can infer an optical depth of order 10% , the fraction of photons scattering in the reionized plasma somewhere in the region of @xmath65 .",
    "this new scattering source can be used to detect the primordial gravity waves .",
    "the signature will show up at very low @xmath30 values , corresponding to the horizon scale at reionization .",
    "figure 6 shows that the region @xmath66 should have substantial effects from gravity waves .",
    "most likely , the only means of detecting such a signal is from space , and even from there it will be very difficult .",
    "the polarization anisotropies for this very low @xmath30 region are comparable to what is expected from the surface of last scattering ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "there are disadvantages to each signature . at the lowest @xmath30 values , galactic foregrounds are more severe , there are fewer modes in which to make a detection , and systematic errors are likely greater . at the higher values ,",
    "there is a foreground that arises from e modes turning into b modes through gravitational lensing ( the topic of the next section ) .",
    "clearly , it will be important to detect the two signatures with the right relative strengths at these two very different scales",
    ".      both the temperature and polarization fields will be slightly distorted ( lensed ) when passing collapsing structures in the late universe .",
    "the bending of light means that one is not looking ( on the last scattering surface ) where one thinks .",
    "although lensing will affect both the polarization and t fields , its largest effect is on the b field , where it shifts power from e to b. gravitational distortions , although preserving brightness , do not preserve the e and b nature of the polarization patterns .",
    "figure 6 also shows the expected power spectrum of these lensed b modes .",
    "because this power is sourced by the e modes , it roughly follows their shape , but with @xmath24 suppressed by a factor of 20 .",
    "the peak structure in the e modes is smoothed , as the structures doing the lensing are degree scale themselves .",
    "owing to the coherence of the lensing potential for these modes , there is more information than just the power spectrum , and work is ongoing to characterize the expected cross correlation between different multipole bands .",
    "this signal should be detectable in next - generation polarization experiments .",
    "for our purposes , the most interesting aspect of this lensing is the handle it can potentially give on the masses of the neutrinos , as more massive neutrinos limit the collapse of matter along the cmb trajectories .",
    "all other parameters held fixed , there is roughly a factor - of - two change in the magnitude of the b signal for a 1-ev change in the mean neutrino mass .      at very small angular scales ",
    "@xmath30 values of a few thousand , way beyond where the acoustic oscillations are damped ",
    "there are additional effects on the power spectra that result from the scattering of cmb photons from electrons after the epoch of reionization , including scattering from gas heated from falling deep in the potential wells of galaxy clusters ( the sunyaev- zeldovich , or sz , effect ) .",
    "these nonlinear effects are important as they can help in untangling ( a ) when the first structures formed and ( b ) the role of dark energy .      in this section ,",
    "we show how the power spectrum information is used to determine important aspects of the universe .",
    "this is normally known as parameter estimation , where the parameters are those that define our cosmology .",
    "the observable power spectrum is a function of at least 11 such basic parameters .",
    "as we discuss below , some are better constrained than others .",
    "first , there are four parameters that characterize the primordial scalar and tensor fluctuation spectra before the acoustic oscillations , each of which is assumed to follow a power law in wave number .",
    "these four are the normalization of the scalar fluctuations ( @xmath68 ) , the ratio of tensor to scalar fluctuations @xmath14 , and the spectral indices for both ( historically denoted with @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "second , there is one equation - of - state parameter ( @xmath71 ) that is the ratio of the pressure of the dark energy to its energy density , and one parameter that gives the optical depth ( @xmath72 ) from the epoch of reionization . finally , there are five parameters that characterize the present universe : its rate of expansion ( hubble constant , with @xmath73 km s@xmath74 mpc@xmath74 ) , its curvature ( @xmath75 ) , and its composition ( baryon density , matter density , and dark energy density ) .",
    "the latter three are described in terms of energy densities with respect to the critical density normalized to the present epoch : @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "just 10 of these are independent as @xmath78 .",
    "even though the cmb data set itself consists of hundreds of measurements , they are not sufficiently orthogonal with respect to the 10 independent parameters for each to be determined independently ; there are significant degeneracies .",
    "hence , it is necessary to make assumptions that constrain the values of those parameters upon which the data have little leverage . in some cases , such prior assumptions ( priors ) can have large effects on the other parameters , and there is as yet no standard means of reporting results .",
    "several teams have done analyses [ wmap ( 11 , 12 ) , cbi ( 13 ) , boomerang ( 14 ) , see also reference 15 ] . here",
    "we first discuss the leverage that the cmb power spectra have on the cosmological parameters .",
    "then we give a flavor for the analyses , together with representative results .",
    "we consider analyses , done by the several teams , with just the six most important parameters : @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , where the other five are held fixed .",
    "for this discussion we are guided by reference 12 .    completely within cmb data",
    ", there is a geometrical degeneracy between @xmath75 , a contribution to the energy density from the curvature of space , and @xmath81 .",
    "however , taking a very weak prior of @xmath82 , the wmap team , using just their first - year data , determined that @xmath83 , that is , no evidence for curvature .",
    "we assume @xmath84 unless otherwise noted .",
    "this conclusion has gotten stronger with the three - year wmap data together with other cmb results , and it is a prediction of the inflationary scenario .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that it is an open experimental issue .",
    "the position of the first acoustic peak reveals that the universe is flat or nearly so .",
    "as we describe above , the generation of acoustic peaks is governed by the ( comoving ) sound horizon at decoupling , @xmath85 ( i.e. , the greatest distance a density wave in the plasma could traverse , scaled to today s universe ) .",
    "the sound horizon depends on @xmath86 , and the radiation density , but not on @xmath87 , or the spectral tilt @xmath88 .",
    "the peak positions versus angular multipole are then determined by @xmath89 , where the quantity @xmath90 , the angular diameter distance , is the distance that properly takes into account the expansion history of the universe between decoupling and today so that when @xmath90 is multiplied by an observed angle , the result is the feature size at the time of decoupling . in a nonexpanding universe , this would simply be the physical distance .",
    "the expression depends on the ( evolution of the ) content of the universe . for a flat universe",
    ", we have @xmath91 in this expression , @xmath92 indicates the ( well - known ) radiation density , and the dilutions of the different components with redshift @xmath0 , between decoupling and the present , enter explicitly .",
    "it is easy to see how one in principle determines spectral tilt .",
    "if one knew all the other parameters , then the tilt would be found from the slope of the power spectrum after the removal of the other contributions .",
    "however , there is clearly a coupling to other parameters .",
    "experiments with a very fine angular resolution will determine the power spectrum at very high @xmath30 values , thereby improving the measurement of the tilt .",
    "here we discuss the primary dependences of the acoustic peak heights on @xmath93 and @xmath94 . increasing @xmath93 decreases the peak heights . with greater matter density , the era of equality",
    "is pushed to earlier redshifts , allowing the dark matter more time to form deeper potential wells .",
    "when the baryons fall into these wells , their mass has less effect on the development of the potential so that the escaping photons are less redshifted than they would be , yielding a smaller temperature contrast . as to @xmath94 , increasing it decreases the second peak but enhances that of the third because the inertia in the photon - baryon fluid is increased , leading to hotter compressions and cooler rarefactions ( 16 ) .",
    "the peak - height ratios give the three parameters @xmath95 , and @xmath94 , with a precision just short of that from a full analysis of the power spectrum ( discussed in section 3.4.4 ) .",
    "following wmap , we define the ratio of the second to the first peak by @xmath96 , the ratio of the third to the second peak by @xmath97 , and the ratio of the first to the second peak in the polarization - temperature cross - correlation power spectrum by @xmath98 .",
    "table 1 shows how the errors in these ratios propagate into parameter errors .",
    "we see that all the ratios depend strongly on @xmath88 , and that the ratio of the first two peaks depends strongly on @xmath94 but is also influenced by @xmath93 . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the relative dependences on @xmath94 and @xmath93 are reversed .",
    "finally , the baryon density has little influence on the ratio of the te peaks .",
    "however , increasing @xmath93 deepens potential wells , increasing fluid velocities and the heights of all polarization peaks .",
    ".matrix of how errors in the peak ratios ( defined in text ) relate to the parameter errors .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here we discuss experiments needed to detect the b - mode signals of lensing at large @xmath30 values and of gravity waves at intermediate and small @xmath30 values .",
    "table 3 shows the sensitivity required to make 3@xmath99 detections of several target signals .",
    "estimates come from equation 9 , either for the full sky or for a smaller patch where the balance between sample variance and detector noise is optimized .",
    "we give expressions for the sensitivity to a feature in the power spectrum centered at @xmath100 and with width @xmath101 and for the fraction of the sky that accomplishes the balance : ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for our purposes , both the signal from lensing and from primordial gravity waves have approximately this shape . here",
    "@xmath104 is the ( peak ) cosmological signal of interest and @xmath105 is the total sensitivity of the experiment , summing over all the observing time and all the detectors .    the lensing detection can be accomplished by observing for a year ( from the ground at a good site such as the atacama desert in chile or the south pole ) a patch of approximately 1.6 square degrees , with detectors having 1.5 times the wmap sensitivity .",
    "the table also gives the sensitivities required to detect primordial b modes at various levels of @xmath12 .",
    "foregrounds will be a problem for @xmath106 , perhaps more so for the detection of the signal from the reionized plasma than from the surface of last scattering .",
    "a satellite experiment can detect the signal from the reionized plasma , where the lensing contamination is nearly negligible .    the planck experiment ( 2007 )",
    "has an order of magnitude in temperature sensitivity over wmap .",
    "polarization sensitivity was not a primary goal .",
    "still , much has gone into making sure the residual systematic uncertainties ( and foregrounds ) can be understood sufficiently well to allow the extraction of polarization signals around 50 nk , corresponding to @xmath107 .",
    "there is a program of experiments over the coming five to eight years .",
    "these will involve , progressively , tens , then hundreds , and nally a thousand or more detectors per experiment and will test polarization modulation schemes , effective scan strategies , foreground - removal methods , and algorithms for separating e and b modes .    experiments with tens of detectors are already underway .",
    "the sister experiments quad and bicep observe from the south pole , using polarization - sensitive bolometers at 100 and 150 ghz .",
    "quad , with a 4-arcmin beam , is optimized for gravitational lensing , whereas bicep , at approximately 40 arcmin , is searching for gravitational waves .",
    "mbi and its european analog brain are testing the idea of using bolometers configured as an interferometer , and pappa is a balloon effort using waveguide - coupled bolometers from the goddard space flight center .",
    "these latter experiments have beams in the range of 0.5@xmath5 to 1@xmath5 .",
    "five initiatives at the level of hundreds of detectors have so far been put forth .",
    "four use tes bolometers at 90 , 150 , and 220 ghz : clover , the lone european effort , with an 8-arcmin beam ; polarbear , with a 4-arcmin beam ; and ebex and spider , balloon - borne experiments with 8- and 20 70-arcmin beams , respectively ( spider and polarbear will use antenna - coupled devices ) .",
    "the fifth uses coherent detectors at 44 and 90 ghz : quiet , initially with a 12-arcmin beam , observing from the atacama desert .",
    "all are dedicated ground - up polarization experiments that build their own optical systems .",
    "the act and spt groups , supported by the national science foundation , deploy very large telescopes to study both the cosmology of clusters via the sz effect and fine - scale temperature anisotropies , and will likely propose follow - up polarimeters .",
    "the reach of the next satellite experiment , termed cmbpol as defined by the three - agency task force in the united states ( 36 ) and termed bpol in europe , is to detect the signal from gravity waves limited only by astrophysical foregrounds . examining figure 6",
    ", we see that @xmath64 , and possibly lower values , can be reached.we should know a great deal from the suborbital experiments well before the 2018 target launch date . for studying polarization at large scales , where foregrounds pose their greatest challenge , information from wmap and planck",
    "will be the most valuable .",
    "there is considerable promise for new , important discoveries from the cmb , ones that can take us back to when the universe s temperature was between the grand unified theory and planck energy scales .",
    "this is particle physics , and while we hope accelerators will provide crucial evidence for , for example , the particle nature of dark matter , exploring these scales seems out of their reach .    in some ways",
    ", cosmology has followed the path of particle physics : it has its standard model , accounting for all confirmed phenomena . with no compelling theory ,",
    "parameter values are not of crucial interest .",
    "we can not predict the mass of the top quark , nor can we predict the primordial energy densities .",
    "each discipline is checking consistency , as any discrepancies would be a hint of new physics .",
    "the cmb field is not as mature as particle physics .",
    "it needs considerable detector development , even for current experiments .",
    "there is rapid progress , and overall sensitivity continues to increase .",
    "foregrounds are certainly not sufficiently known or characterized .",
    "there is a great deal of competition in the cmb , like the early days of particle physics before the experiments grew so large that more than one or two teams exploring the same topic worldwide was too costly . for the moment",
    ", this is good , as each team brings something unique in terms of control of systematics , frequencies , regions of the sky scanned , and detection technology .",
    "however , there is a difference in the way results are reported in the two fields . in the cmb field , typically almost nothing is said about an experiment between when it is funded and when it publishes . here",
    "publishing means that results are announced , multiple papers are submitted and circulated , and often there is a full data release , including not only of raw data and intermediate data products but sometimes support for others to repeat or extend the analyses .",
    "the positives of this tradition are obvious .",
    "however , one negative is that one does not learn the problems an experiment is facing in a timely manner .",
    "there is a degree of secrecy among cmb scientists .",
    "there are other differences .",
    "cmb teams frequently engage theorists to perform the final analysis that yields the cosmological significance of the data .",
    "sophisticated analysis techniques are being developed by a set of scientists and their students who do not work with detectors but do generate a growing literature .",
    "there are as yet no standardized analysis techniques ; effectively each new experiment invents its own .",
    "the days appear to be over where the group of scientists that design , build , and operate an experiment can , by themselves , do the full scientific analysis .",
    "another distinction is that there is no one body looking over the field or advising the funding agencies , and private funds sometimes have a major impact .",
    "nearly all cmb scientists are working on multiple projects , sometimes as many as four or five , holding that many grants .",
    "more time is spent writing proposals and reports and arranging support for junior scientists , for whom there is little funding outside of project funds .",
    "this is certainly not the optimum way to fund such an exciting and promising field .",
    "the authors have enjoyed many productive conversations with colleagues at their institutions in the course of preparing this review .",
    "the authors are particularly grateful for helpful comments from norman jarosik , bernd klein , laura la porta , and kendrick smith .",
    "we also wish to acknowledge our collaborators in quiet and capmap for frequent discussions of relevant issues .",
