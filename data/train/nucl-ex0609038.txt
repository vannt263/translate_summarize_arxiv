    "it is now generally accepted that in au+au collisions at rhic , a state of matter characterized as a strongly interacting , low viscosity fluid of quarks and gluons ( termed sqgp ) is created .",
    "in addition to the soft processes leading to to the formation of this medium , there are relatively rare hard parton - parton collisions",
    ". the scattered partons may interact with the medium as they propagate through it , till they finally fragment into jet - like clusters .",
    "since such interactions can modify jet fragmentation , jets provide a powerful probe of the medium , provided one can reliably extract the jet signal from the relatively large background which exists in rhic collisions .",
    "jet modification leading to shock wave induced conical flow ( a `` sonic boom '' ) @xcite and a  deflected - jet \" induced by interactions between the propagating partons and the flowing medium @xcite are leading candidates .",
    "to study jet properties we use three - particle correlation functions built by combining a hadron in a specified high transverse momentum range ( @xmath1 gev / c ) with two associated hadrons in an adjacent low transverse momentum range ( @xmath2 gev / c ) .",
    "the real triplets are obtained by combining all three particles from the same event .",
    "the mixed triplets are obtained by combining three particles from three different events . by transforming to the frame of reference in which the z - axis is defined by the high @xmath3 particle momentum vector , a two dimensional correlation function",
    "is obtained in @xmath4 , @xmath5 space where @xmath4 is the polar angle of one of the low @xmath3 particles and @xmath5 is the difference of azimuthal angles of the two associated particles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "the three particle correlation functions can then be shown as polar plots in which @xmath4 is plotted along the radial axis and @xmath5 is plotted along the azimuthal axis ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig1]b ) .",
    "trigger particle serves as the near - side jet axis .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 indicate associated particles on the near - side and @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate associated particles on the away - side .",
    "( left panel ) simulated three - particle correlation for a deflected away - side jet in the phenix acceptance .",
    "( right panel ) same as left panel but for a conical away - side jet . ]",
    "simulated three - particle correlation surfaces are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1]a and [ fig1]c for two distinct away - side jet scenarios ; ( i ) a  deflected jet \" in which the away - side jet axis is misaligned by @xmath10 , and ( ii ) a  cherenkov or conical jet \" in which the leading and away - side jet axes are aligned but fragmentation is confined to a very thin hollow cone with a half angle of @xmath10 .",
    "it is interesting to note here that these correlation surfaces reflect the removal of harmonic contributions but _ do _ include 2 + 1 three - particle combinatoric contributions .",
    "that is , 2 + 1 correlations involving three particles , where two come from the jet / di - jet and the other from some other non - jet source .",
    "nonetheless , both figures show rather clear distinguishing features for the two simulated scenarios considered .",
    "the full three - particle correlation surface ( no harmonic or 2 + 1 subtraction ) obtained from data for the centrality selection 0 - 5% in au+au collisions is shown in fig .",
    "[ 3pc_cor_0 - 5]b . a reminder of the coordinate frame used is given in fig .",
    "[ 3pc_cor_0 - 5]a . in this polar ( @xmath11 ) representation",
    ", one can clearly see the near - side jet correlations which are expected at the center of the correlation surface ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "one can also see sizable correlations in @xmath5 for @xmath13 , albeit with acceptance losses especially in the region about ( @xmath14 ) . even without combinatoric background subtraction ,",
    "it is apparent that the away - side jet shows a shape which is significantly different from that expected from a normal jet ( ie .",
    "enhanced correlations for @xmath15 ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the resulting correlation surface ( for centrality 20 - 40% ) after removal of the harmonic contributions via a two - dimensional equivalent of the zyam procedure outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    ", the away - side jet correlations show a striking peak away from @xmath16 for most of @xmath5 albeit with inefficiencies associated with the phenix acceptance . figs . [ 3pc_cor_0 - 5]b and [ fig3 ] provide compelling evidence for strong modification of the away - side jet .",
    "the correlations shown in figs .  [ 3pc_cor_0 - 5]a and [ fig3 ] are quite suggestive",
    ". however , a definitive and quantitative distinction of the mechanistic origin of the away - side jet modification requires the further step of removing the 2 + 1 combinatoric contributions from figs .",
    "[ 3pc_cor_0 - 5]a and [ fig3 ] . given the potential utility of these correlation measurements as additional constraints for the viscosity and sound speed of hot qcd matter @xcite , this step is being pursued vigorously .",
