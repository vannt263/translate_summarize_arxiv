    "the launch of swift satellite has led to tremendous discoveries of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "a surprising one is that large x - ray flares are common in grbs and occur at times well after the initial prompt emission @xcite .",
    "the x - ray flare is an episodic phenomena showing a sudden brightness at the late afterglow stage . from the spectral and temporal analysis of x - ray flares ,",
    "it is strongly suggested that x - ray flares may have a common origin as the prompt gamma - ray pulses and are related to the late time activity of the central engine @xcite .    for the energy reservoir of powering grbs or x - ray flares",
    ", it is believed that they are produced through an ultra - relativistic jet , i.e. , a neutrino annihilation - driven jet or a poynting flux - dominated jet . for the former jet , neutrinos annihilate above the disk and form a hot fireball which subsequently expand to accelerate the jet by its thermal pressure @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of a poynting flux - dominated jet",
    ", the jet derives its energy from the rotational energy of the central black hole ( bh ) via the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms were proposed to explain the episodic phenomenon of x - ray flares , including fragmentation of a rapidly rotating core @xcite , magnetic regulation of the accretion flow @xcite , fragmentation of the accretion disk @xcite , differential rotation in a post - merger millisecond pulsar @xcite , transition from thin to thick disk @xcite , he - synthesis - driven winds @xcite , the propagation instabilities in grb jets @xcite , and the episodic , magnetically dominated jets @xcite . apart from the energy and the episodic activity of x - ray flares , their evolution has also been investigated , which shows that the average energy released in the form of x - ray flares overlaid on the power - law decay of the afterglow of grbs @xcite .    in the present work , we will concentrate on another issue , i.e. , whether or not the remnant disk after the prompt gamma - ray emission can power x - ray flares through neutrino annihilation .",
    "the luminosity of neutrino annihilation produced by the accretion disk is sensitive to the accretion rate . in the late stage of disk evolution",
    ", the accretion rate will probably be quite low ( e.g. , @xmath4 s@xmath2 ) and the annihilation luminosity will drop sharply according to previous numerical calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in other words , the observed x - ray flares , if produced by the annihilation mechanism , will still require a relatively high accretion rate .",
    "we take the second flare of grb 070318 as an example , which has an isotropic luminosity of @xmath5 erg s@xmath2 and a rest frame duration of 80.6 s ( see table  1 ) . in order to produce such a luminosity by neutrino annihilation ,",
    "an accretion rate around @xmath6 s@xmath2 is required for a rapidly rotating bh ( @xmath7 ) due to our numerical calculations in section  3 , which is consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the required remnant disk mass is around @xmath8 , which is obviously beyond what the progenitor can provide ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this work",
    ", we will investigate the neutrino - cooled disk with the magnetic coupling ( mc ) between the inner disk and the bh , where the magnetic field connects the accretion disk and the central bh @xcite .",
    "in such a model , the angular momentum and the energy are transported from the bh horizon to the accretion disk through a closed magnetic field .",
    "accordingly , this transported energy will be released and therefore increase the radiation of the disk @xcite .",
    "the mc effects on the structure and radiation of neutrino - cooled disks have first been studied by @xcite .",
    "they showed that both the neutrino luminosity and the annihilation luminosity will increase significantly owing to the mc process . in the present work , we will focus on relatively low accretion rates @xmath9 s@xmath2 to study the possibility of the remnant disk to power x - ray flares .",
    "we would point out that , although such type of magnetic fields is one of the possible field geometries discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  2 ) and has been studied by a few previous works , the existence of such magnetic fields remains a problem according to mhd simulations .",
    "we will discuss this issue in the last section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "equations are presented in section  2 .",
    "the structure and neutrino radiation of the disk are calculated in section  3 .",
    "a comparison of our numerical results with the observed x - ray flares is shown in section  4 .",
    "conclusions and discussion are made in section  5 .",
    "for neutrino - dominated accretion , the disk is extremely hot and dense and the neutrino radiation can balance the viscous dissipation . the structure and radiation of such a disk",
    "have been widely investigated in previous works @xcite .",
    "some simulations showed that the accretion flow is very dynamic and the inner radius of the flow changes with time .",
    "in addition , the flow is subject to various hd and mhd instabilities so that it is non - asymmetric . in order to avoid the complexity of solving partial differential equations ,",
    "the present work is still based on the assumption of a steady and axisymmetric accretion flow . in such case ,",
    "the basic equations of the neutrino - cooled accretion disk including the mc effects may refer to section  2 of @xcite , and the relativistic effects of the spinning bh were shown in @xcite .    for simplicity , we define the gravitational radius as @xmath10 , the dimensionless radius as @xmath11 , and the dimensionless spin parameter as @xmath12 .",
    "the disk is assumed to be keplerian rotating , thus the angular velocity of the flow is expressed as @xmath13    in the present work , we investigate the properties of the neutrino - cooled disk with magnetic field lines connecting the bh with the inner disk .",
    "such a mc process may have substantial effects on the energy and angular momentum balance of the disk @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that the inner part of the disk is magnetically coupled to the bh , but the magnetic field can not be stable in the outer region . here , we follow the assumptions of @xcite that the mc process is constrained by a critical polar angle @xmath14 , and the magnetic field varies as a power law with the disk radius .",
    "the magnetic torque exerted to the disk from the bh horizon can be expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath14 is a critical polar angle . in the scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  1 ) , the mc process exists in the range @xmath16 . on the contrary , for the space with @xmath17 , the bz process may occur and therefore some accreted materials may be pushed away , particularly in the inner region of the disk . in the present study , we will focus on the mc process and a constant accretion rate is assumed for simplicity .",
    "the critical angle is calculated by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 g @xmath23 s@xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the ratio of the angular velocity of the disk ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegad ] ) ) to the angular velocity at the horizon , where @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , under the equipartition assumption ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the magnetic field strength at the horizon can be estimated as @xmath27 .",
    "the energy equation is written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the viscous heating rate , including the contributions of the gravitational potential @xmath30 and the mc process @xmath31 .",
    "the quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respectively the advective cooling rate and the neutrino cooling rate . here",
    ", we neglect the radiation of photons since they are trapped in the disk .",
    "the neutrino cooling generally consists of the four processes : the electron - positron pair annihilation , the bremsstrahlung emission of nucleons , the plasmon decay , and the urca process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , for the equation of state , the total pressure consists of five terms , i.e. , the gas pressure , the radiation pressure , the degeneracy pressure , the neutrino pressure , and the magnetic pressure .",
    "the detailed description of the neutrino cooling and the pressure can be found in some previous papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the term of magnetic pressure , following @xcite , the ratio of magnetic pressure to total pressure is assumed to be 0.1 .",
    "in our calculations we fix @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath7 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the numerical results of structure and radiation are shown in figure  1 , where the solid lines and the dashed lines represent the solutions with and without the mc process , respectively .",
    "we choose three accretion rates , i.e. , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 @xmath41 s@xmath2 for the study .",
    "figures  1a , 1b , and 1c show respectively the radial profiles of the mass density , the temperature , and the neutrino cooling efficiency defined as the ratio of the neutrino cooling rate to the viscous heating rate @xmath42 .",
    "it is seen that , for the outer region with @xmath43 , the solid and dashed lines are identical to each other , which implies that the mc effects in this region are negligible . on the contrary , for the inner region with @xmath44 , the solid lines and the dashed lines are apparently separate , which indicates that the mc effects are substantial . for the inner region ,",
    "figure  1a shows that the density with mc is obviously larger than that without mc .",
    "the physical understanding is as follows .",
    "the mc process can transfer angular momentum from the bh to the inner disk . as a consequence , the additional transferred angular momentum will work as a barrier to prevent the flow from radial acceleration , and therefore the accreted matter will accumulate in this region and the mass density will significantly increase . on the other hand , for @xmath45 s@xmath2 , it is shown by figure  1a that the solid line drops inwards even faster than the dashed line .",
    "the reason is that , for large @xmath46 , the disk will become optically thick to neutrinos .",
    "thus , most of the generated neutrinos are trapped in the disk instead of escaping away .",
    "the total pressure , which includes the neutrino pressure , will therefore increase significantly and the disk will probably become geometrically thick . accordingly , the mass density will drop sharply due to the increased vertical height and radial velocity . the neutrino trapping",
    "can be also indicated by figure  1c , where the solid line steeply drops inwards for @xmath45  s@xmath2 , indicating that most neutrinos are trapped in the disk rather than being radiated .      in the scenario of hyper - accretion disks ,",
    "the grbs are powered by the neutrino and anti - neutrino annihilation above the surface of disks .",
    "since the x - ray flares and the gamma - ray emission have the same power origin , the flares may still be powered by the neutrino annihilation .",
    "the disk luminosity is calculated from the marginal stable orbit @xmath47 to the outer boundary @xmath48 .",
    "the neutrino luminosity from the disk is calculated as @xmath49 the total annihilation luminosity is calculated by the integration over the whole space outside the disk , following the method in previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure 2 shows the variations of the neutrino luminosity @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and the annihilation luminosity @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) with the mass accretion rate @xmath46 .",
    "similar to figure  1 , the solid lines and the dashed lines represent the solutions with and without the mc process , respectively .",
    "the upper solid ( dashed ) line corresponds to @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , and the lower solid ( dashed ) line corresponds to @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "it is seen that , both the neutrino luminosity and the annihilation luminosity with the mc process are significantly larger than those without the mc process . in particular for relatively low accretion rates such as @xmath54 s@xmath2 , @xmath52 is larger than @xmath53 by up to four orders of magnitude .",
    "the physical reason is that , in addition to the gravitational energy , the mc process can efficiently extract the bh rotational energy into neutrino radiation .",
    "moreover , the apparent difference between the lower solid line and the lower dashed line implies that it is quite possible for a remnant low - mass disk to power x - ray flares .",
    "we compare the efficiency of bh rotational energy extraction between the mc process and the bz mechanism .",
    "the former efficiency is defined as @xmath55 for the bz mechanism , the magnetic field lines , which are dragged in by the accretion disk , accumulate around the bh horizon and then get twisted by the bh space - time , which enable the extraction of bh rotational energy .",
    "the efficiency of the bz process was discussed in @xcite , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the dimensionless magnetic flux threading the bh , @xmath58 is a numerical constant related to the magnetic field geometry ( we adopt @xmath59 here ) , and @xmath60 is set to be 1 .",
    "the above equation shows that the bz efficiency is relevant to the dimensionless magnetic flux @xmath61 .",
    "the value of @xmath61 , however , is quite uncertain and may be related to the accretion rate . it can be regarded as the ability for the accretion disk to drag magnetic fields into the bh horizon .",
    "recent simulations show that @xmath61 can be as large as several tens and the disk can be depicted as a magnetic arrest disk . at a high @xmath61 ,",
    "a large amount of magnetic flux is transported to the center and the efficiency can be larger than 1 . here",
    "we simply assume a constant magnetic flux , @xmath62 , which is close to the simulation result @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : etamc ] ) implies that @xmath64 is independent of the accretion rate @xmath46 .",
    "the variation of @xmath64 and @xmath65 with the spin parameter @xmath66 is shown in figure  3 .",
    "it is seen that , for @xmath67 , @xmath64 can be significantly larger than the efficiency of normal accretion process @xmath68 , and can be even larger than 1 for extremely spinning bh .",
    "such a result indicates that the mc process is quite an efficient mechanism to extract the bh rotational energy .",
    "the efficiency @xmath64 decreases sharply with decreasing @xmath66 for @xmath69 .",
    "the reason is that the angular velocity of bh will be less than that of the disk at isco for @xmath70 , and therefore the mc process will become weak for bh spin below this critical value .",
    "it is also seen that , for @xmath71 , @xmath64 is several times larger than @xmath65 , whereas for @xmath72 , @xmath65 is significantly larger than @xmath64 due to a sharp decrease of @xmath64 with decreasing @xmath66 . in other words , for fast spinning bh systems , mc may be more powerful than bz on the extraction of rotational energy , whereas for slow spinning bh systems , bz is likely to be more powerful .    another different effect between mc and bz",
    "is that , the bz process can directly transfer the rotational energy into the jet , whereas the mc process can only transfer the rotational energy into the disk , and the jet power is also related to another process , i.e. , neutrino annihilation .",
    "thus , for the efficiency of powering the jet , the bz process will probably be much more efficient . for a comparison ,",
    "the dotted line shows the efficiency of radiation due to neutrino annihilation @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) for a typical accretion rate @xmath75  @xmath1  s@xmath2 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath65 is significantly larger than @xmath73 for any @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the bz process is more efficient to power a jet than the mc process .",
    "it is also possible for the bz process to work as the central engine to power the x - ray flares .",
    "in order to compare our numerical results with the observations of x - ray flares , we compile a sample of 21 grbs with 43 flares as shown in table  1 , which includes all the flares with available redshift in table  1 of @xcite .",
    "the width of the flares is calculated in the rest frame : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the redshift , @xmath78 is the observed width , and @xmath79 is the width in the rest frame . the isotropic energy of a flare @xmath80 can be estimated from the fluence @xmath81 : @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the luminosity distance . thus , the average , isotropic luminosity can be obtained as @xmath84 .    a comparison of our numerical results with the observations is shown in figure  [ fig : flare ] , which includes all the flares in table  1 . similar to figures  1 and 2 , the solid lines represent the results with mc , whereas the dashed lines represent the results without mc .",
    "the upper and lower solid ( dashed ) lines correspond to the disk mass @xmath85  @xmath1 and 0.05  @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the four theoretical lines are calculated by @xmath86 together with the relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath87 obtained in section  3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : flare ] shows that most of the flares locate above the upper dashed line , which means that for the case without mc , it will generally require a remnant disk mass @xmath88 significantly larger than 0.5  @xmath1 , which may be unpractical .",
    "however , it is seen that most of the flares exist between the two solid lines , which indicates that if mc works , a reasonable remnant disk with @xmath89 is able to power nearly all the plotted flares . as mentioned in section  1 ,",
    "taking the second flare of grb 070318 as an example , the model without mc requires @xmath90 . on the contrary",
    ", if the mc effects are taken into account , the luminosity of @xmath5 erg s@xmath2 corresponds to @xmath91 s@xmath2 ( according to our numerical calculations shown by the lower solid line in figure  2 ) .",
    "therefore , the rest frame duration 80.6 s only requires @xmath92 for powering this flare .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the neutrino - cooled disks by taking into account the mc process between the central bh and the inner disk .",
    "we have shown that , for mass accretion rates around @xmath0 @xmath1 s@xmath2 , the luminosity of neutrino annihilation can be enhanced by up to four orders of magnitude due to the mc effects . as a consequence , the remnant disk with @xmath3  @xmath1 may power most of the observed x - ray flares with the rest frame duration less than 100 seconds .",
    "we would point out that , for a few x - ray flares with extremely long duration , the neutrino - cooled disk can not work as the central engine , even though mc is included .",
    "for example , grb 050724 has three flares with a redshift of 0.258 .",
    "the third flare of this source has a rest frame width of @xmath93 seconds and the luminosity @xmath94 erg s@xmath2 . according to our numerical results in figure 2",
    ", the accretion rate should be around @xmath95 s@xmath2 for the case including mc .",
    "thus , it requires a remnant disk @xmath96 , which is obviously unphysical .",
    "on the other hand , x - ray flares with peak time less than and larger than 1000 s may have different origin @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for powering the flares with peak time larger than 1000 s is worthy for further studies , but is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "another issue we would like to stress is related to the configuration of the large - scale magnetic field in accretion disks .",
    "although the mc process has been studied by quite a few previous works , such type of magnetic fields , however , has not been found in mhd simulations .",
    "thus , it remains unclear whether the mc process can occur between the inner disk and the central bh .",
    "on the other hand , some simulations showed that the bz mechanism can be a solution to the grb s central engine ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in the scenario of the poynting flux - dominated jet",
    ", the efficiency of extracting the bh rotational energy mainly depends on the magnetic flux being dragged in @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis showed that it requires a geometrically thick disk to transport a large mount flux into the center @xcite .",
    "simulations also confirmed that a thick disk can efficiently transport magnetic flux @xcite . for a neutrino - cooled disk ,",
    "neutrinos play a vital role to release the dissipation heat and the disk is likely to be geometrically thin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "then , for the poynting flux - dominated jet , it remains a problem whether the accretion flow can accumulate adequate magnetic fields to the inner region to power the jet .    in this work",
    ", the flow is assumed to be steady and the mass accretion rate is a free parameter . in other words , for a given accretion rate , we will obtain a corresponding solution . on the other hand",
    ", the simulations of @xcite found a correlated variation between the accretion rate and the magnetic flux @xmath97 . in this spirit",
    ", a varying strength of mc process may also have effects on the variation of accretion rate .",
    "such a study requires further time - dependent calculations .",
