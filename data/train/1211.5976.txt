    "it is well recognized that the large scale structure of the universe stems from primordial fluctuations generated quantum mechanically during inflation .",
    "remarkably , the nature of primordial fluctuations is independent of initial conditions .",
    "this nice feature can be associated with the conjecture that the initial anisotropy and inhomogeneity rapidly disappear .",
    "this is called the cosmic no - hair conjecture .",
    "the cosmic no - hair is proved in an ideal situation @xcite .",
    "namely , a homogeneous expanding spacetime with a cosmological constant rapidly approaches de sitter spacetime , i.e. , the initial anisotropy decays in a hubble time , when we assume that matter satisfies the strong and dominant energy conditions . in general , however , it is not clear whether the cosmic no - hair conjecture is correct or not .",
    "in fact , a counter example to this conjecture was found @xcite . there ,",
    "spin-1 gauge fields remain during inflation and the anisotropy does not necessarily vanish .",
    "moreover , it turned out that anti - symmetric tensor fields can also generate the anisotropy @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to explore the possibility that a symmetric spin-2 tensor as matter causes the violation of the cosmic no - hair conjecture .",
    "historically , a model of massive spin-2 matter has been proposed as that of meson @xcite , which can be regarded as bimetric gravity consisting of the physical metric and the other spin-2 tensor field . in order to treat the spin-2 matter ,",
    "therefore , we need to construct a consistent ghost - free theory of bimetric gravity .",
    "fortunately , this task has been accomplished recently @xcite .",
    "given a consistent model of spin-2 matter , we can study the cosmic no - hair conjecture .",
    "there are some reasons that we expect the conjecture can be violated . in the presence of spin-2 matter",
    ", it is inevitable that gravitons have the mass as the consequence of mixing between the physical metric and the other spin-2 tensor field .",
    "when we consider massive gravitons in an expanding spacetime , the decay time scale of the anisotropy is determined by comparing hubble scale with the effective mass of gravitons . for example , by taking the couplings of the physical metric and the spin-2 matter small , the hubble friction term might be dominant compared with the effective mass term in the equation of motion then the decay time scale becomes much longer than hubble time scale",
    ". besides the above one , there may be the violation of the energy conditions in the presence of the spin-2 matter @xcite .",
    "since the energy conditions are assumed in the proof of @xcite , it is not apparent whether the cosmic no - hair holds or not in bimetric gravity .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a cosmological constant in bimetric gravity as the limit of slow roll inflation .",
    "first , we concretely reveal the property of de sitter solutions in bimetric gravity .",
    "then , we investigate the fate of the anisotropy perturbatively .",
    "we stress that it is important to study the background geometry in detail because the effective mass of gravitons can depend on the background geometry .",
    "since , in known cases , the violation of the cosmic no - hair appears already at the linear level , we expect the linear analysis reflects the feature at the nonlinear level .",
    "when we consider massive gravitons in de sitter spacetime , we also need to care about the fact that the helicity-0 mode of massive gravitons becomes a ghost when the effective mass is below the higuchi bound @xcite .",
    "note that this ghost is different from a boulware - deser type ghost @xcite which is already removed by construction . since there is no a priori reason to forbid the mass of gravitons violating the higuchi bound",
    ", we also check if the effective mass satisfies the higuchi bound .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in section [ sec : ab",
    "] , we present ghost - free bimetric gravity and derive basic equations needed for the analysis . in section [ sec : l0 ] , we study the cosmic no - hair in bimetric gravity in the presence of the cosmological constant in the physical sector .",
    "we find that de sitter solutions are stable and the small anisotropy rapidly decays . in section [ sec :",
    "ln0 ] , we introduce the other cosmological constant and investigate the stability of de sitter solutions and the fate of the anisotropy .",
    "we also study whether the higuchi bound is satisfied or not .",
