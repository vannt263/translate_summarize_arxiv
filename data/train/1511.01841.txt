    "the past decade has witnessed the great success of ads / cft duality  @xcite , which relates a @xmath0-dimensional quantum field theory to a gravity theory living in @xmath1 dimensions . as a strong / weak duality",
    ", it has been successfully applied on various areas of modern physics to deal with problems where traditional methods confront great challenge or even break down .",
    "one such particular important application , the so - called ads / cmt ( condensed matter physics ) , is to gain a better understanding of numerous exotic but very important features of electronic materials , such as high temperature superconductors where bcs theory fails . within the standard framework of ads / cft",
    ", it was suggested that the normal / superconducting phase transition in boundary field theory corresponds to a second - order phase transition in the dual gravity side , where the bulk ads black hole , under a charged scalar field perturbation , tends to develop a scalar hair  @xcite .",
    "this so - called holographic superconductor model can indeed reproduce some properties of superconductor by doing calculations in the ads black hole which is dual to relativistic cft at finite temperature .",
    "various holographic superconductor models have been developed , for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "generally , systems near critical points exhibit a scaling symmetry and can be described by a cft . however , many realistic condensed matter systems near critical points , although exhibiting a scaling symmetry , have different scalings in the spatial and time directions  @xcite .",
    "a prototype example of such critical points is a lifshitz fixed point , where the degree of anisotropy between the spatial and time directions is parameterized by a dynamical exponent @xmath2 . to describe such a lifshitz fixed point in ads / cft ,",
    "a non - relativistic version of this duality has been developed , where the bulk is a lifshitz - like geometry rather than an asymptotically ads geometry  @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to construct holographic superconductors in these geometries  @xcite , and it is found that holographic superconductivity still exists .",
    "many new features appear in these holographic superconductors .",
    "the effect of the dynamical exponent is explored  @xcite , and it is found that , for fixed conformal dimension of the scalar operator , the critical temperature decreases as the dynamical exponent increases . the ratio of the gap frequency to the critical temperature is found to be a little larger than the one in the relativistic case  @xcite .    recently , the lifshitz - like geometries are extended to even more sophisticated geometries , the so - called hyperscaling violating geometries  @xcite , which on top of anisotropic scaling , have also an overall hyperscaling factor under the scaling parameterized by the hyperscaling violation exponent @xmath3 .",
    "that means the metric is no longer invariant under the scaling but covariant .",
    "the neutral hyperscaling violating geometries can be constructed starting from a einstein - maxwell - dilaton action  @xcite , where a @xmath4 gauge field is coupled with a dilaton and responsible for generating the hyperscaling violation .",
    "their charged cousins have also been constructed by adding into the action another @xmath4 gauge field  @xcite , which is also required to couple with the dilaton to generate charged solutions .",
    "this kind of geometry has received considerable attention due to its potential applications in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of this kind of geometry appears when the hyperscaling violation exponent assumes the special value @xmath5 , when the holographic entanglement entropy exhibits logarithmic violation of the usual area law  @xcite , indicating that this kind of geometry can provide a gravitational dual for the theory with a fermi surface .",
    "holographic superconductors are also investigated in neutral black brane with hyperscaling violation to explore the effect of the hyperscaling violation exponent . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the increase of the hyperscaling violation makes the condensation of the scalar operator harder for small @xmath3 but easier for large @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the higher hyperscaling violation changes the usual relation in the gap frequency . in this holographic superconductor model , the probed maxwell field",
    "is not coupled with the background dilaton . however , from the above statement , we know that this coupling is necessary to generate a charged hyperscaling violating black brane  @xcite .",
    "so it is natural to see if there is still superconductivity when such a coupling is taken into account .",
    "this is the main task of our present work .",
    "we will see that the superconductivity still exists but with features modified by such a coupling .    the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will briefly review the black brane background with hyperscaling violation . by applying both numerical and sturm - liouville ( s - l ) analytical methods",
    ", we will explore the effect of the hyperscaling violation exponent on the normal / superconducting phase transition . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the conductivity and the influence of the hyperscaling violation .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary and to conclusions .",

    "it is interesting to note that the line element is not invariant under the scaling but covariant with the hyperscaling violation exponent @xmath3 .    for convenience , in the following discussion",

    "the hyperscaling violation exponent @xmath3 is constrained as  @xcite @xmath22 we will fix @xmath23 in the following sections , this means that the dual field theory is @xmath24-dimensional .",
    "to study the holographic superconductor with hyperscaling violation in the probe limit , we consider the maxwell - scalar action @xmath25 in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , here we consider the probed maxwell field @xmath26 to be coupled with the background dilaton .",

    ", we have the relation @xmath47 which is typical of second order phase transition with the mean - field exponent @xmath48 .",

    "our results show that there should still exist superconductivity when we consider the coupling between the probed maxwell field and the background dilaton .",
    "to see the influence of the dynamical exponent @xmath2 and the hyperscaling violation exponent @xmath3 on the condensation , we calculate the critical temperature for various values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in fig .  2",
    ", we show some of the results .",
    "we can see that , for fixed @xmath2 and the mass of the scalar field , when we increase the hyperscaling violation exponent @xmath3 , the critical temperature decreases .",
    "this result is completely different from the case without the coupling between the maxwell field and the backgound dilaton , where , as @xmath3 increases , the critical temperature first decreases and then increases  @xcite .",
    "we can also see that , for fixed @xmath3 and the mass of the scalar field , the critical temperature is not always a monotonic function of the dynamical exponent @xmath2 , the situation depends both on the mass of the scalar field and the hypercaling violation exponent @xmath3 . from the left panel",
    "where @xmath49 , we can see that the critical temperature increases as @xmath2 increases , even for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 for @xmath52 , respectively ) . however , when we decrease the mass of the scalar field , the critical temperature is no longer a monotonic function of @xmath2 .",
    "from the last two panels where @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively , we can see that the three lines with different @xmath2 intersect at a point @xmath55 . when @xmath56 , the critical temperature decreases as @xmath2 increases , while for @xmath57 we have opposite behavior .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath58 depends on the mass of the scalar field .      in this section ,",
    "we use the s - l analytical method  @xcite to analyze the critical temperature and critical phenomena , and then to confirm our numerical results derived above .    at the critical temperature @xmath59 ,",
    "there is no condensation @xmath60 , thus the equation of motion of @xmath61  ( [ phieq ] ) reduces to @xmath62 with the boundary condition  ( [ bnyhorizon ] ) , we obtain the solution @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the horizon radius at the critical point .    with the boundary condition  ( [ psibny ] ) we assume @xmath65 takes the form @xmath66 where the trial function @xmath67 satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "then the equation of motion for @xmath65 , eq .  ( [ psieq ] ) , can be written in the form @xmath70 with @xmath71 this takes the standard form of the sturm - liouville equation  @xcite and the minimal eigenvalue of @xmath72 can be estimated by minimizing the expression @xmath73 after getting @xmath74 we can calculate the critical temperature as @xmath75    the trial function @xmath67 can be chosen as a polynomial function satisfying the boundary conditions , for example we can choose @xmath76 with a constant @xmath77 to be determined by minimizing the expression . also , we can choose @xmath67 to contain higher order terms as done in ref .  @xcite .",
    "but in our case , second order is enough to re - produce the numerical results .    in fig .  3",
    ", we show the relation between the critical temperature and the hyperscaling violation exponent @xmath3 derived from the s - l method .",
    "we also show the numerical results here derived above to make a comparison . from the figure , we can see that , for the cases we considered , the results derived from the s - l method match very well with the numerical results .",
    "next let us analyze the critical phenomena near the critical temperature .",
    "as the condensation @xmath41 is very small at this moment , we can expand @xmath78 in @xmath41 as @xmath79 where we have introduced @xmath80 and @xmath81 satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath82 and @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "then the @xmath61-equation  ( [ phieq ] ) becomes @xmath84 doing one step of integration on both sides , we get @xmath85 from the above expression , we know that @xmath86 as @xmath34 .    on the other hand , near the critical temperature @xmath87 . thus at the infinite boundary @xmath34 , we have @xmath88.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by equating the @xmath89 term of both sides , we get @xmath90 leading to @xmath91 the critical exponent assumes the mean - field value @xmath92 .",
    "this confirms our previous result  ( [ condenscaling ] ) .",
    "to compute the conductivity , we consider a perturbed maxwell field in @xmath93-direction taking the form as @xmath94 .",
