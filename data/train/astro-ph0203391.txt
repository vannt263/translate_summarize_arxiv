    "two broad classes of long - duration gamma - ray burst ( grb ) progenitors have survived scrutiny in the afterglow era : the coalescence of compact binaries ( see @xcite for review ) and massive stars @xcite .",
    "more exotic explanations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fail to reproduce the observed redshift distribution , detection of transient x - ray lines , and/or the distribution of grbs about host galaxies .    in the latter viable scenario , the so - called `` collapsar '' model @xcite",
    ", the core of a massive star collapses to a compact stellar object ( such as a black hole or magnetar ) which then powers the grb while the rest of the star explodes .",
    "we expect to see two unique signatures in this scenario : a rich circumburst medium fed by the mass - loss wind of the progenitor @xcite and an underlying supernova ( sn ) . despite extensive broadband modeling of afterglows , unambiguous signatures for a wind - stratified circumburst media",
    "have not been seen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    there has , however , been been tantalizing evidence for an underlying sn .",
    "the first association of a cosmologically distant grb with the death of a massive star was found for grb 980326 , where a clear excess of emission was observed , over and above the rapidly decaying afterglow component .",
    "this late - time `` bump '' was interpreted as arising from an underlying sn @xcite since , unlike the afterglow , the bump was very red .",
    "grb 970228 , also with an intermediate - time bump and characteristic sn spectral rollover , is another good candidate @xcite .",
    "suggestions of intermediate - time bumps in grb light curves have since been put forth for a number of other grbs @xcite .",
    "most of these results are tentative or suspect with the sn inferences relying on a few mildly deviant photometric points in the afterglow light curve .",
    "even if some of the bumps are real , a number of other explanations for the physical origin of such bump have been advanced : for example , dust echoes @xcite , shock interaction with circumburst density discontinuities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thermal re - emission of the afterglow light @xcite . to definitively distinguish between the sn hypothesis and these alternatives , detailed spectroscopic and multi - color light curve observations of intermediate - time bumps are required .",
    "it is against this background that we initiated a program with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) to sample afterglow light curves at intermediate and late - times .",
    "the principal attractions of hst are the photometric stability and high angular resolution .",
    "these are essential in separating the afterglow from the host galaxy and in reconstructing afterglow colors .    on theoretical grounds ,",
    "if the collapsar picture is true , then we expect to see a type ib / ic sn @xcite . in the first month , core - collapsed supernova spectra are essentially characterized by a blackbody ( with a spectral peak near @xmath05000  ) modified by broad metal - line absorption and a strong flux suppression blueward of @xmath1   in the restframe . for grbs with low redshifts , @xmath2 ,",
    "the effect of this blue absorption blanketing is a source with an apparent red spectrum at observer - frame optical wavelengths ; at higher redshifts , any supernova signature is highly suppressed . for low redshift grbs ,",
    "intermediate - time follow - up are , then , amenable to observations with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) . in this _ letter",
    "_ we report on wfpc2 multi - color photometry of grb 011121 ( @xmath3 ; @xcite ) and elsewhere we report on observations of grb 010921 ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) . in a companion paper ( @xcite",
    "; hereafter paper ii ) , we report a multi - wavelength ( radio , optical and nir ) modeling of the afterglow .",
    "on 2001 november 21.7828 ut , the bright grb 011121 was detected and localized by _ bepposax _ to a 5-arcmin radius uncertainty @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations of the error circle refined by the ipn and _ bepposax _ ( see paper ii ) revealed a fading optical transient ( ot ) @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations with the magellan 6.5-m telescope revealed redshifted emission lines at the ot position ( @xmath3 ) , indicative of a bright , star - forming host galaxy of grb 011121 @xcite .      for all the hst visits ,",
    "the ot and its underlying host were placed near the serial readout register of wf chip 3 ( position wfall ) to minimize the effect of charge transfer ( in)efficiency ( cte ) .",
    "the data were pre - processed with the best bias , dark , and flat - field calibrations available at the time of retrieval from the archive ( `` on  the  fly '' calibration ) .",
    "we combined all of the images in each filter , dithered by sub - pixel offsets , using the standard iraf / dither2 package to remove cosmic rays and produce a better sampled final image in each filter .",
    "an image of the region surrounding the transient is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the point source was detected at better than 20 @xmath5 in epochs one , two and three in all filters , and better than 5 @xmath5 in epoch four .",
    "0.4 cm    0.2 cm [ fig:1121im ]    given the proximity of the ot to its host galaxy , the final hst images were photometered using the iraf / daophot package which implements psf - fitting photometry on point - sources @xcite .",
    "the psf local to the ot was modeled with pstselect and psf using at least 15 isolated stars detected in the wf chip 3 with an adaptive kernel to account for psf variations across the image ( varorder = 1 ) .",
    "the resulting photometry , reported in table [ tab : hst - mag ] , was obtained by finding the flux in an 0.5 radius using a psf fit .",
    "we corrected the observed countrate using the formulation for cte correction in @xcite with the most up - to - date parameters ; such corrections , computed for each individual exposure , were never larger than 8% ( typically 4% ) for a final drizzled image .",
    "we estimated the uncertainty in the cte correction , which is dependent upon source flux , sky background , and chip position , by computing the scatter in the cte corrections for each of the images that were used to produce the final image .",
    "the magnitudes reported in the standard bandpass filters in table [ tab : hst - mag ] were found using the @xcite prescription .",
    "in figure  2 we plot the measured fluxes from our four hst epochs in the f555w , f702w , f814w and f850lp filters .",
    "we also plot measurements made at earlier times ( 0.5 d @xmath6 3 d ) with ground - based telescopes and reported in the literature .",
    "these magnitudes were converted to fluxes using the zero - points of @xcite and plotted in the appropriate hst filters .",
    "[ fig : lc ]    [ fig : sfd ]    corrections for color effects between the ground - based filters and hst filters were taken to be negligible for the purpose of this exercise .    the estimated contribution from the afterglow",
    "is heavily weighted by the available data : our ground - based data ( and those reported in the literature so far ) are primarily at early times .",
    "roughly , over the first week , the afterglow exhibits a simple power law decay .",
    "the afterglow contribution derived from our nir data and optical data from the literature ( see paper ii ) is shown by the dashed line in each panel .",
    "no afterglow light curve breaks ( e.g. , from jetting ) were assumed .",
    "@xcite drew attention to an excess of flux ( in @xmath7-band ) , at a time 13  days after the grb , with respect to that expected from the power - law extrapolation of early - time afterglow emission ; they suggested the excess to arise from an underlying sn .",
    "as can vividly be seen from our multi - color data , the excess is seen in all bands and over several epochs .",
    "we used the light curve and spectra of the well - studied type ic supernova sn  1998bw @xcite to create a comparison template broad - band light curve of a type ic supernova at redshift @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , the spectra of sn 1998bw were used to compute the @xmath9-corrections between observed photometric bands of 1998bw and _ hst _ bandpasses ( following @xcite and @xcite ) . a flat @xmath10 cosmology with @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 and @xmath13 was assumed and we took the galactic foreground extinction to sn 1998bw of @xmath14 mag @xcite .",
    "since dimmer ic sne tend to peak earlier and decay more quickly ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) , much in the same way that sn ia do , we coupled the flux scaling of sn 1998bw with time scaling in a method analogous to the `` stretch '' method for sn ia distances @xcite .",
    "to do so , we fit an empirical relation between 1998bw and 1994i to determine the flux - time scaling .",
    "we estimate that a 1998bw - like sn that is dimmed by 55% ( see below ) , would peak and decay about 17% faster than 1998bw itself .",
    "some deviations from our simple one - parameter template are apparent , particularly in the f555w band and at late - times .    in figure 3 , we plot the spectral flux distributions ( sfds ) of the intermediate - time bump at the four hst epochs . a clear turn - over in the spectra in the first 3 epochs",
    "is seen at about 7200  .",
    "the solid curve is the sfd of sn  1998bw transformed as described above with the associated 2-@xmath5 errors .",
    "bearing in mind that there are large systematic uncertainties in the template ( i.e. , the relative distance moduli between sn 1998bw and grb 011121 ) and in the re - construction of the red bump itself ( i.e. , the galactic extinction toward grb  011121 and the contribution from the afterglow in the early epochs ) , the consistency between the measurements and the sn is reasonable .",
    "we consider the differences , particularly the bluer bands in epoch one , to be relatively minor compared with the overall agreement .",
    "this statement is made in light of the large observed spectral diversity of type ib / ic sne ( see , for example , figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented unambiguous evidence for a red , transient excess above the extrapolated light curve of the afterglow of grb  011121 .",
    "we suggest that the light curve and spectral flux distribution of this excess appears to be well represented by a bright sn . while we have not yet explicitly compared the observations to the expectations of alternative suggestions for the source of emission ( dust echoes , thermal re - emission from dust , etc . ) , the simplicity of the sn interpretation  requiring only a ( physically motivated ) adjustment in brightness ",
    "is a compelling ( i.e. , occam s razor ) argument to accept our hypothesis .",
    "given that the red bump detections in a number of other grbs occur on a similar timescale as in grb 011121 , any model for these red bumps should have a natural timescale for peak of @xmath15 day ; in our opinion , the other known possibilities do not have such a natural timescale as compared with the sn hypothesis .",
    "indeed , if our sn hypothesis is correct , then the flux should decline as an exponential from epoch four onward .",
    "the ultimate confirmation of the supernova hypothesis is a spectrum which should show characteristic broad metal - line absorption of the expanding ejecta ( from , e.g. , ca ii , ti ii , fe ii ) .",
    "we used a simplistic empirical brightness ",
    "time stretch relation to transform 1998bw , showing good agreement between the observations and the data .",
    "if we neglect the time - stretching and only dim the 1998bw template , then the data also appear to match the template reasonably well , however , the discrepancies in the bluer bands become somewhat larger and the flux ratios between epochs are slightly more mismatched .",
    "the agreement improves if we shift the time of the supernova to be about @xmath035 days ( restframe ) before the grb time .",
    "occurrence times more than about ten days ( restframe ) before the grb can be ruled out .",
    "this observation , then , excludes the original `` supranova '' idea @xcite , that posited a supernova would precede a grb by several years ( see eq .  [ 1 ] of @xcite ) .",
    "modified supranova scenarios that would allow for any time delay between the grb and the accompanying sn , albeit _ ad hoc _ , are still consistent with the data presented herein .",
    "regardless of the timing between the sn explosion and the grb event ( constrained to be less than about 10 days apart ) , the bigger picture we advocate is that grb 011121 resulted from an explosive death of a massive star .",
    "this conclusion is independently supported by the inference , from afterglow observations of grb 011121 ( paper ii ) , of a wind - stratified circumburst medium .",
    "the next phase of inquiry is to understand the details of the explosion and also to pin down the progenitor population .",
    "a large diversity in any accompanying sn component of grbs is expected from both a consideration of sne themselves and the explosion mechanism .",
    "the three main physical parameters of a type ib / ic sn are the total explosive energy , the mass of the ejecta , and the amount of nickel synthesized by the explosion ( @xmath16 ) . the peak luminosity and time to peak",
    "are roughly determined by the first two whereas the exponential tail is related to @xmath16 .",
    "ordinary ib / ic sne appear to show a wide dispersion in the peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "there is little _ ab initio _ understanding of this diversity ( other than shifting the blame to dispersion in the three parameters discussed above ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that grbs are not spherical explosions and are , as such , usually modeled as a jetted outflow .",
    "@xcite model the afterglow of grbs and have presented a compilation of opening angles , @xmath17 , ranging from less than a degree to 30 degrees and a median of 4 degrees .",
    "if grbs have such strong collimation then it is not reasonable to assume that the explosion , which explodes the star , will be spherical .",
    "we must be prepared to accept that the sn explosion is extremely asymmetric and thus even a richer diversity in the light curves . this expected diversity may account for both the scale factor difference between the sn component seen here and in sn 1998bw seen in figure 3 .",
    "indeed , there has been a significant discussion in the literature as to the degree which the central engine in grbs will affect the overall explosion of the star @xcite .",
    "these models currently have focused primarily on the hydrodynamics and lack the radiative modeling necessary to compare observations to the models .    clearly , the next step is to obtain spectroscopy ( and perhaps even spectropolarimetry ) and to use observations to obtain a rough measure of the three - dimensional velocity field and geometry of the debris . as shown by grb 011121",
    "the sn component is bright enough to undertake observations with the largest ground - based telescopes .",
    "we end by noting the following curious point .",
    "the total energy yield of a grb is usually estimated from the gamma - ray fluence and an estimate of @xmath17 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the energy in the afterglow is used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , for grb  011121 , the energy in the sn component ( scaling from the well - studied sn  1998bw ) is likely to be comparable or even larger than that seen in the burst or the afterglow . in view of this , the apparent constancy of the @xmath18-ray energy release is even more mysterious .",
