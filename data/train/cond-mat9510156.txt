    "the conductance through a tunnel junction is proportional to the electron density of states in the two electrodes . for metallic electrodes , which have a non - zero density of states at the fermi energy , the tunnel junction current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics are ohmic at low bias . in marked contrast , recent theories@xcite have predicted strongly non - ohmic behavior for tunneling through a point contact separating two fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) fluids . specifically , for filling factor @xmath8 , with odd integer @xmath9 , the tunnel current at zero temperature is predicted to vary with voltage as @xmath10 . at finite temperatures ,",
    "ohmic behavior is recovered at small voltages , with a zero bias differential conductance varying as , @xmath11 .",

    "the non - ohmic tunneling conductance is due to the strange properties of the edge states in the fqhe .",
    "fqhe edge states are a beautiful realization of one - dimensional luttinger liquids@xcite .",
    "in contrast to metallic electrodes , the tunneling density of states in a luttinger liquid _ vanishes _ at the fermi energy , which leads to the vanishing tunnel conductance between two fqhe fluids .",
    "thus , in contrast to conventional metallic tunnel junctions , a fqhe tunnel junction is an _",
    "insulator_.    an _ insulating _ point contact junction is , in many respects , the dual of a superconducting point contact - namely a josephson junction . in a josephson junction the i - v curve is also strongly non - ohmic , with voltage vanishing rapidly for currents below the critical current , @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the zero bias resistance is expected to vanish exponentially as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , with energy barrier @xmath16 . under exchange of current with voltage ,",
    "the behavior is similar to the vanishing conductance in the fqhe point contact . in a josephson junction ,",
    "the phase difference between the superconducting electrodes is behaving classically , whereas in the fqhe junction the classical variable is the transferred electron charge .",
    "one of the most striking manifestations of the ac josephson effect , is the presence of quantized voltage steps ( shapiro steps ) in an applied microwave field@xcite .",

    "the duality between josephson junctions and fqhe junctions , suggests that the latter might also exhibit interesting behavior in the presence of an applied ac field . in this paper",
    ", we study in detail the effect of an ac drive on a fqhe tunnel junction , focussing on the structure induced in the @xmath19 characteristics .",
    "one anticipates the possibility of mode locking between the ac drive and the electron tunnelling events",

    "moreover , it was suggested that an applied ac drive would mode lock to these oscillations resulting in current plateaus .",
    "a more favorable geometry for current plateaus , consists of multiple tunnel junctions in series , which can be separately tweaked by an ac drive , thereby transferring the electrons one - by - one through the circuit .",
    "such an electron  turnstile \" was realized experimentally , by a number of groups , both in metallic systems@xcite and in semiconductor heterostructures@xcite . due to the multiple junction geometry",
    "the tunstiles only work well at rather low frequencies , below tens of megahertz . at higher frequencies",
    "the electrons take too long to pass across the junctions , and do not  keep up \" with the ac drive .    in a josephson junction",
    "shapiro steps are very robust , and do not need complicated multiple junction geometries . moreover ,",
    "shapiro steps are observed up to quite frequencies , comparable to the superconducting gap .",

    "there are two parallel processes which allow charge to be transported across the junction .",
    "in addition to electron tunnelling  under the barrier \" , the electron can absorb quanta of energy from the ac drive field .",
    "once the electron energy is high enough , it can pass over the washboard barrier . in the classical limit ,",
