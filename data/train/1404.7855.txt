    "it is called the `` eta ( @xmath28 ) problem '' in sugra inflation models .",

    "<S> the large tensor spectrum recently observed by the bicep2 collaboration requires a super - planckian field variation of the inflaton in the single - field inflationary scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the required slow - roll parameter @xmath0 would restrict the e - folding number to around 7 in ( sub-)planckian inflationary models . to overcome such problems </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a two - field scenario based on the natural assisted supersymmetric ( susy ) hybrid model ( `` natural susy hybrid inflation '' @xcite ) , which combines the susy hybrid and the natural inflation models . the axionic inflaton field from the natural inflation sector can admit the right values for the tensor spectrum as well as a spectral index of @xmath1 with a decay constant smaller than the planck scale , @xmath2 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy of @xmath3 with 50 e - folds is provided by the inflaton coming from the susy hybrid sector , avoiding the eta problem . </S>",
    "<S> these are achieved by introducing both the u(1)@xmath4 and a shift symmetry , and employing the minimal k@xmath5hler potential . </S>"
