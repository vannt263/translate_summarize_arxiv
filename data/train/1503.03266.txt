    "gaarder & wolf  @xcite showed that perfect instantaneous output - feedback can increase the capacity of the two - user memoryless multiple - access channel ( mac ) by enabling cooperation between the transmitters .",

    "( a notable exception being ozarow s capacity result for the two - user gaussian mac with perfect feedback @xcite . )",
    "the gaarder - wolf scheme has been extended by cover & leung @xcite who introduced the ideas of block - markov coding and superposition coding .",
    "specifically , in the cover - leung scheme , in each block  @xmath0 , the transmitters send independent fresh data superposed on common update information belonging to the previous block  @xmath1 . after observing the outputs in block  @xmath0",
    ", the receiver creates a list of all possible pairs of block-@xmath0 fresh data that is compatible ( jointly typical ) with these outputs .",
    "it also decodes the common update information .",
    "this common update information describes resolution information that allows the receiver to resolve its block-@xmath1 list , and thus to identify the fresh data that was sent in block  @xmath1 . in order to be able to compute and send the block-@xmath0 common update information , the transmitters have to decode each other s fresh data sent in block  @xmath1 and calculate the receiver s block-@xmath1 list .",
    "they perform these tasks using their block-@xmath1 input signals and the block-@xmath1 feedback signals .",
    "( in case of perfect feedback , the latters correspond to the receiver s channel outputs . ) for some macs with perfect feedback the presented cover - leung scheme is optimal and achieves capacity  @xcite . for others , for example for the gaussian mac  @xcite , it is strictly suboptimal  @xcite .",
    "the cover - leung scheme has been improved by relaxing the requirement that after the transmission of each block , the transmitters have to decode each other s fresh data sent in this block  @xcite . instead , the decoding at the transmitters ( and also at the receivers ) is delayed , allowing the transmitters to gain more information about each other s message before decoding .",
    "this results in less stringent rate - constraints as compared to the original cover - leung scheme .",
    "to implement this idea , bross & lapidoth @xcite proposed to append to each block a two - way transmitters - exchange phase and to delay the transmitters decoding thereafter .",
    "venkataramanan & pradhan @xcite suggested to delay the transmitters decoding of the fresh data by an entire block . in their scheme , in each block  @xmath0 the transmitters send two sorts of resolution information , common _ receiver - side resolution information _ to resolve the receiver s uncertainty about the block-@xmath1 fresh data , and correlated _ transmitters - side resolution information _ to resolve each transmitter s uncertainty about the other transmitter s block-@xmath1 fresh data .",

    "<S> our scheme combines ideas from the venkataramanan - pradhan scheme for perfect feedback with ideas from the shaviv - steinberg scheme for rate - limited feedback .    </S>",
    "<S> our achievable region includes the shaviv - steinberg achievable region and this inclusion can be strict . for general macs and for sufficiently large feedback rates , our scheme outperforms the shaviv - steinberg scheme as it achieves the same rate region as the venkataramanan - pradhan scheme for perfect feedback ( which can not be achieved by the shaviv - steinberg scheme ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we numerically evaluate our achievable region with a specific ( gaussian ) choice of random variables for the memoryless two - user gaussian mac . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation results show that for some parameters of the gaussian mac and the feedback rate , our scheme achieves a strictly larger sum - rate than the shaviv - steinberg scheme . </S>"
