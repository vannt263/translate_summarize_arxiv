    "the discovery of a higgs - like boson at the lhc @xcite marks the beginning of a new era in particle physics .",
    "the properties of the new particle appear to be close to those predicted for an elementary scalar with couplings as given by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the hierarchy problem  the question about the ultra - violet ( uv ) sensitivity of the scalar sector and the stability of the higgs potential under quantum fluctuations  is thus more pressing than ever . in extensions of the sm",
    "the scalar sector can be stabilized in various ways .",
    "the most popular solution to the hierarchy problem is low - scale supersymmetry , which protects the higgs - boson mass by linking it to the masses of its fermionic partners .",
    "an interesting alternative is provided by models featuring a warped extra dimension @xcite , in which the sm is embedded in a compact extra dimension of anti - de  sitter space , while the scalar sector is localized on one of two branes bounding the fifth dimension .",
    "the fundamental uv cutoff of the model is the warped planck scale , whose value near this `` infra - red ( ir ) brane '' lies in the tev range .",
    "these models , introduced by randall and sundrum ( rs ) , provide particularly attractive scenarios of tev - scale new physics , since in addition to the hierarchy problem they also address the flavor puzzle and yield an attractive framework for understanding the hierarchies of fermion masses and mixing angles @xcite and the smallness of flavor - changing neutral currents @xcite .",
    "precision measurements of the higgs - boson couplings to sm particles , which are accessible via studies of both the higgs production cross sections and its decay rates into various final states , present unique opportunities to test the sm description of electroweak symmetry breaking and search for indirect hints of new physics . in the context of warped extra dimensions ,",
    "higgs physics has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "the effect on the @xmath0 amplitude caused by the heavy @xmath1 state , the @xmath2 partner of the top quark predicted in rs models with custodial symmetry , was investigated in @xcite .",
    "models in which the higgs scalar is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson , such as warped gauge - higgs unification scenarios , were studied in @xcite .",
    "one finds that the result for the @xmath0 amplitude only depends on the fundamental parameter @xmath3 of these models , but that it is insensitive to the details about the spectrum of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) quarks . the authors of @xcite have studied the effect of kk resonances on the loop - induced @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings by working out the corrections to the top- and bottom - quark yukawa couplings induced by their mixing with kk states . in these papers no significant contributions from the heavy kk quark states propagating in the loop were observed , because the yukawa interactions coupling the higgs to two @xmath6-odd fermions ( the second term in the last line of ( [ gdef ] ) below ) were implicitly assumed to be zero . with @xmath7 for the masses of the kk quarks ,",
    "see eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 10 ) of their paper , which is incorrect . ]",
    "the possibly large effect on the higgs - boson couplings induced by the shift of the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) relative to its sm value , which can arise in rs models with custodial symmetry , was emphasized in @xcite .",
    "the first complete calculation of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings , in which both types of yukawa interactions in ( [ gdef ] ) were included , was performed in @xcite . in this paper both the production of higgs bosons in the gluon fusion process as well as",
    "the main decay channels were studied in an extended rs model with custodial symmetry .",
    "it was observed that the dominant corrections to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings arise from the towers of kk quark states propagating in the loop , and that these effects are to a very good approximation independent of the masses of the corresponding sm quarks .",
    "the production rate was found to be suppressed in most regions of parameter space , while the branching fraction for the diphoton channel @xmath8 tends to be enhanced with respect to the sm . at about the same time , an independent analysis of the higgs couplings to gluons and photons appeared @xcite , which reached the opposite conclusions . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the discrepancy between the two sets of results can be traced back to a subtlety in the calculation of the loop - induced higgs couplings to gluons and photons . in order to compute the relevant overlap integrals of fermion wave functions with the brane - localized higgs field ,",
    "it is necessary to regularize the higgs profile in an intermediate step and give it an infinitesimal width @xmath9 @xcite . when the calculation of the gluon fusion amplitude is performed in a naive way",
    ", the limits of sending the regulator to zero ( @xmath10 ) and including an infinite number of kk modes ( @xmath11 ) in the sum over virtual states do not commute .",
    "this ambiguity disappears once the loop calculation is performed in the presence of a consistent uv regulator , such as dimensional regularization with @xmath12 space - time dimensions . for the case of a brane - localized higgs sector ,",
    "one then obtains the results of @xcite no matter in which order the limits are taken .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached by using a hard uv momentum cutoff on the four - dimensional ( 4d ) loop integral .",
    "the physical significance of the results found in @xcite was not fully elucidated in @xcite , but the discussion in that paper suggests that they might refer to a certain limit of a model featuring a higgs boson living in the bulk of the extra dimension .",
    "it was demonstrated that the gluon fusion amplitude receives an unsuppressed `` resonance contribution '' from high - mass kk states , which can resolve the wave function of the higgs boson ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is absent for a brane - localized scalar sector .    in the present paper",
    ", we shed new light on these issues by performing the calculation of the @xmath0 amplitude as a five - dimensional ( 5d ) loop calculation . in this way the very notion of kk states is avoided , the infinite sum over kk states is performed implicitly , and the only relevant limit to be considered is that of sending the regulator @xmath9 of the higgs profile to zero . in the context of dimensional regularization , we find that this limit can be taken either before or after performing the loop integration . in both cases",
    "we confirm the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "if the width of the higgs profile is kept finite , in a way that will be specified more precisely below , we recover the findings of @xcite .",
    "they correspond to a model with a narrow bulk - higgs field , whose shape along the extra dimension can be resolved by the high - momentum modes of the rs model .",
    "the 5d analysis highlights the relevance of different mass scales . in brane - higgs models , these are the higgs vev @xmath13 , the kk mass scale @xmath14 , and the physical uv cutoff @xmath15 of the rs model near the ir brane . models in which the higgs boson is treated as a narrow bulk state contain , in addition , the scale @xmath16 ( the inverse width of the higgs profile ) .",
    "it makes an important difference whether this scale lies above or below the cutoff .",
    "the relevant loop integrand approaches a first plateau for euclidean loop momenta @xmath17 and a second one for @xmath18 ( see figure  [ fig : t1gen ] in section  [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "while in brane - higgs models the second plateau is absent , in bulk - higgs scenarios the @xmath0 amplitude receives an unsuppressed contribution from the high scale @xmath19 , and it is thus sensitive to physics on distances shorter than @xmath20 .",
    "it is worth noting in this context that naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) indicates that the @xmath0 amplitude is finite for the case of a bulk - higgs field , but that it is logarithmically divergent by power counting if the higgs sector is localized on the ir brane . as explained in @xcite , however , systematic cancellations between the yukawa couplings of the various fermion states within each kk level ensure the finiteness of the result also in the brane - localized higgs scenario .",
    "analogous cancellations were observed in @xcite for the case of loop - induced dipole - operator contributions to flavor - changing processes .",
    "the 5d loop calculation performed in the present work confirms this observation and yields convergent results for both scenarios .",
    "we do not address the question whether the @xmath0 amplitude remains finite at two - loop order and beyond .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : setup ] , we define our setup and present some important remarks concerning the classification of the various rs models considered in our study . in section  [ sec : leff ] , we derive an exact representation of the dimensionally - regularized gluon fusion amplitude in terms of an integral over the mixed - chirality components of the 5d quark propagator in the mixed momentum - position representation , including the contributions of the sm quarks and the full dependence on the higgs - boson mass . to the best of our knowledge , such a result has not been presented before .",
    "our expression holds for an arbitrary higgs profile .",
    "the calculation of the 5d propagator for the case of a very narrow higgs profile localized near the ir brane is performed in section  [ sec : prop ] , with technical details relegated to appendix  [ app : details ] . in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we use these results to evaluate the @xmath0 amplitude and show explicitly that taking the limit @xmath10 commutes with the integration over the 4d loop momentum .",
    "we prove a conjecture made in @xcite for the analytic form of the contribution of the infinite tower of heavy kk quark states .",
    "we also present an alternative derivation of the same result by implementing the brane - localized yukawa terms via appropriate boundary conditions in the field equations for the fermion mass eigenstates . in this approach , the notion of an infinitesimal regulator @xmath9 does not appear , and many of the subtleties related to the @xmath10 limit are avoided from the beginning .",
    "we also consider a generalization of the model in which two different yukawa matrices enter in the 5d yukawa interactions .",
    "we then discuss the changes that occur when the width of the higgs profile is kept small but non - zero , corresponding to the case of a narrow bulk - higgs field . in section  [ sec :",
    "powerhgg ] , we address the question of the numerical importance of power - suppressed operators , which contribute to the @xmath0 amplitude at tree level .",
    "they can arise because rs models are effective field theories valid below some cutoff .",
    "we argue that even if the uv completion of these models is strongly coupled , the corresponding power corrections are likely to be much smaller than the rs loop effects calculated in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "while most of our discussion refers to the minimal rs model with the sm gauge group in the bulk , we generalize our results in section  [ sec : custodial ] to an extended rs model with a custodial symmetry protecting electroweak precision observables @xcite .",
    "contrary to the minimal rs scenario , this model allows for masses of kk excitations that are in reach of the lhc @xcite .",
    "phenomenological implications of our findings in the context of recent lhc data are discussed in section  [ sec : pheno ] , where we study the corrections to the higgs - boson production cross section in three different versions of both the minimal and the custodially protected rs model .",
    "we illustrate the magnitude of the effects as a function of the mass of the lightest kk gluon state and the scale of the 5d yukawa matrices , and derive the regions in parameter space that are already excluded by recent lhc measurements .",
    "our main results are summarized in the conclusions .",
    "some technical details of our calculations are collected in four appendices .",
    "our focus in this work is on minimal rs models , in which the electroweak symmetry - breaking sector is localized on or near the ir brane .",
    "the extra dimension is taken to be an @xmath21 orbifold , labeled by a coordinate @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "two branes are localized on the orbifold fixed - points @xmath23 ( uv brane ) and @xmath24 ( ir brane ) .",
    "the size @xmath25 and curvature @xmath26 of the extra dimension are assumed to be of planck size , @xmath27 .",
    "the rs metric reads @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 is referred to as the warp factor . the quantity @xmath31 measures the size of the extra dimension . in the second equation above",
    "we have introduced a new coordinate @xmath32 , where @xmath33 determines the hierarchy between the planck scale and the tev scale , and @xmath34 sets the mass scale for the low - lying kk excitations of the sm particles . is related to the conformal coordinate @xmath35 frequently used in the literature by the simple rescaling @xmath36 . ]",
    "our primary focus is on models where the scalar sector is localized on ( or very near ) the ir brane at @xmath37 , in contrast to more complicated models , in which the higgs boson is a 5d field propagating in the extended bulk of the extra dimension @xcite .",
    "while some of these extended models are rather appealing and deserve further investigation , also with regard to their higgs phenomenology , we believe that the minimal models define important benchmark scenarios which should be explored first .",
    "this is not least because only in these cases analytic expressions for the production and decay amplitudes of the higgs boson can be derived",
    ". a more detailed discussion of bulk - higgs models can be found in appendix  [ app : bulkhiggs ] .    before presenting our results ,",
    "we find it useful to make a few comments concerning our definition of a brane - localized higgs sector , which is general enough to allow for a non - zero width of the higgs profile , as long as it can not be resolved by the modes of the theory and hence does not affect any observables .",
    "recall that rs models are effective field theories with an inherent , position - dependent uv cutoff given by the warped planck scale @xcite @xmath38 this accounts for the fact that they do not provide a description of quantum gravity .",
    "the variation of the uv cutoff along the extra dimension is a crucial feature in order for rs models to provide a solution to the hierarchy problem . if the sector of electroweak symmetry breaking lives on or near the ir brane at @xmath37 , then the effective uv cutoff regularizing quantum corrections to the scalar sector is of order @xmath39 .",
    "the little hierarchy problem is not addressed by rs models , because the theory must contain several kk modes ( and hence the value of @xmath15 must be in the multi - tev range ) in order to deserve the attribute `` extra dimensional '' . as argued in @xcite",
    ", the scale @xmath15 also provides the effective uv cutoff in loop graphs involving higgs bosons .",
    "the condition that the fermionic modes in the effective theory can not resolve the width of the higgs boson can be stated as @xmath40 where @xmath41 sets the scale for the dimensionless , 5d yukawa couplings of the model . only if this condition is satisfied , the higgs field can be regarded as being localized on the ir brane in the sense that any possible extension into the bulk does not give rise to observable effects . as shown in @xcite , another consequence of condition ( [ branehiggs ] )",
    "is that the results for the loop - induced @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings can be well approximated by performing truncated sums over a small number of kk modes , whose individual yukawa couplings are evaluated in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "relation ( [ branehiggs ] ) should be considered as a condition on the regulator @xmath9 at fixed , physical uv cutoff @xmath15 . for",
    "a brane - localized higgs field one should take the limit @xmath10 wherever possible , but the above condition states that keeping @xmath9 finite but smaller than the bound on the right - hand side would not change the physics",
    ".    a higgs profile with a width @xmath42 must be regarded as a bulk field .",
    "the features of the higgs profile can then be resolved by the high - momentum states in the effective theory , and indeed one finds that high - mass kk fermions make sizable contributions . in the general case ,",
    "the gluon fusion amplitude in an rs model with a bulk - higgs field depends in a complicated way on the shapes of the higgs and fermion profiles along the extra dimension ( see @xcite for an approximate treatment ; a more detailed analysis will be presented in @xcite ) . however , we find that for a narrow higgs profile , defined by the relation @xmath43 a model - independent expression can be derived , which generalizes the findings of @xcite .",
    "our results for the case of a narrow bulk - higgs scenario are in full agreement with those obtained in @xcite for the analogous case of loop - induced dipole - operator contributions to flavor - changing processes .",
    "working under the assumption that the higgs width is much larger than the inverse cutoff on the ir brane ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) , these authors find important contributions from high - mass kk states , which probe the `` bulky '' nature of the higgs field .",
    "we take an agnostic point of view regarding the question which kind of rs model is theoretically most appealing .",
    "the overwhelming majority of the rs literature has been based on models in which the scalar sector is localized on the ir brane .",
    "these models should therefore be included as a benchmark in any phenomenological study . yet , having the higgs as the only brane - localized field is somewhat peculiar , and after realizing that successful models of electroweak symmetry breaking can be constructed with a scalar sector in the bulk one may consider this to be a more appealing scenario .",
    "the fact that important one - loop amplitudes such as @xmath0 and @xmath45 are convergent by naive power counting in bulk - higgs models adds to their attractiveness .",
    "however , a bulk - higgs model featuring a very narrow higgs profile ( @xmath46 ) requires some fine - tuning .",
    "the most natural assumption would be that @xmath47 .",
    "we will see that the results obtained under the two assumptions ( [ branehiggs ] ) and ( [ bulkhiggs ] ) are rather different , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "indeed , one should consider the two scenarios as two different , distinguishable realizations of rs models .",
    "this fact has also been realized in @xcite .",
    "the situation resembles that encountered when one compares the original rs model , in which only gravity was allowed to propagate in the extra dimension while all sm fields were confined to the ir brane @xcite , with the more popular models in which all matter and gauge fields live in the bulk @xcite .",
    "while the original model only addressed the hierarchy problem , the latter models are qualitatively different in that they also provide successful theories of flavor .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         figure  [ fig : crs ] confirms the fact that the corrections to the higgs - boson production rate are much enhanced compared with the case of the minimal rs model .",
    "correspondingly , we obtain significantly larger exclusion regions than for the minimal model .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : crsexcl ] . in the brane - higgs scenario ,",
    "we obtain the exclusion range @xmath48tev for @xmath49 at 99% cl , while in the bulk - higgs model we find the lower bound @xmath50tev at 95% cl .",
    "note that the allowed region in the upper left corner ( at small @xmath51 and large @xmath52 ) of the first plot in the figure is one in which the new - physics contribution to the gluon fusion amplitude is larger than the sm contribution by about a factor 2 and interferes destructively , which appears somewhat unnatural .",
    "moreover , it has been argued that most models in which the gluon fusion amplitude has the opposite sign than in the sm have problems with fine - tuning and vacuum stability @xcite .",
    "the bounds on the rs parameter space that can be derived from figure  [ fig : crs ] are stronger than those derived from the analysis of electroweak precision observables . in the custodial model the formula for the @xmath53 parameter shown in ( [ sandt ] )",
    "is left unchanged , while the custodial protection removes the leading term proportional to @xmath54 in the expression for the @xmath55 parameter , such that @xmath56 @xcite . requiring that these corrections are compatible with the experimental data",
    ", we find that @xmath57tev at 95% cl .",
    "as indicated by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : crsexcl ] , this lower bound is generally much weaker than the constraints implied by higgs physics , except for regions in parameter space where @xmath52 is very small .",
    "note that for such small values of the kk mass scale but @xmath58 , the rs flavor problem for the @xmath59 parameter can be solved by a fine - tuning of 510% , or alternatively by enlarging the strong - interaction gauge group in the bulk @xcite .",
    "we may also read the exclusion plots in a different way .",
    "if we would like to have the first kk excitations in the reach for direct production at the lhc , then this imposes a strong upper bound on the maximum allowed values of the elements of the 5d yukawa matrices .",
    "for instance , assuming that @xmath60tev , we find that @xmath61 in the brane - higgs model , and @xmath62 in the bulk - higgs scenario ( both at 95% cl ) .",
    "too small yukawa couplings would however give rise to enhanced corrections to @xmath59 @xcite , and hence they would reinforce the rs flavor problem .",
    "the above analysis shows that higgs physics , and in particular the higgs - boson production rate in gluon fusion , provide sensitive probes of the virtual effects of kk excitations in the context of various rs scenarios .",
    "while models with a brane - localized scalar sector predict a suppression of the gluon fusion rate , this rate tends to be enhanced in scenarios with a bulk - higgs field .",
    "the two classes of models can thus easily be distinguished in their signatures .",
    "the bounds on the model parameters obtained from higgs physics are complementary to and sometimes stronger than those derived from the analysis of electroweak precision observables and rare flavor - changing processes . in models with a custodial protection of electroweak precision observables , the indirect effects of kk states on the higgs - boson production rate",
    "are strongly enhanced compared with minimal rs models , and hence higgs physics provides the strongest constraints in this case . even under the pessimistic ( but not unrealistic ) assumption that the direct detection of kk excitations is out of the reach of the lhc",
    ", one may still see sizable modifications of the higgs - boson production cross section .",
    "for example , even with @xmath63tev or even 15tev , figures  [ fig : mrs ] and [ fig : crs ] show that virtual effects of kk particles can have significant effects on the higgs - boson production cross section , provided that the 5d yukawa couplings are not too small .",
    "we also note that different implementations of warped extra - dimension models , such as little rs models in which the bounds from electroweak precision measurements and flavor physics are relaxed by reducing the size @xmath54 of the extra dimension @xcite , give rise to very similar higgs phenomenology , because the @xmath54-dependent corrections in ( [ eqn : rh_min ] ) and ( [ eq100 ] ) have only a minor impact .",
    "the discovery of a higgs - like boson at the lhc @xcite has raised the demand for an explanation of the hierarchy problem .",
    "precise measurements of the higgs - boson couplings to various sm particles can provide valuable tools to distinguish between different new - physics models addressing this problem .",
    "such measurements can elucidate the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and probe for indirect hints of new particles .",
    "of particular importance are loop - induced processes , such as the higgs - boson production process @xmath0 and the radiative decay @xmath8 , since possible new heavy resonances can lead to sizable deviations from the sm expectations .    in this paper",
    ", we have focused on the gluon fusion cross section in various incarnations of rs models , in which the scalar sector is localized on or near the ir boundary of a warped extra dimension .",
    "we have derived an exact expression for the @xmath0 amplitude in terms of an integral of the mixed - chirality components of the 5d fermion propagator with the higgs - boson profile along the extra dimension .",
    "this expression can be used to calculate the effective cp - even and cp - odd @xmath64 couplings , as long as one succeeds in deriving an explicit expression for the propagator .",
    "in contrast to the procedure commonly used in the literature , all our calculations have been performed by keeping the exact dependence on the higgs - boson mass . moreover , working in a 5d framework we have avoided the notion of kk modes from the beginning , which means that the infinite sum over fermionic kk modes is performed implicitly . only at the end of the calculation we have been able to identify the contributions of the sm particles and their kk towers to the effective @xmath64 couplings .",
    "this removes any ambiguities as to the order in which one should perform the limits @xmath11 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the 5d analysis also elucidates the relevance of different mass scales .",
    "while in models with a brane - localized higgs sector the gluon fusion amplitude receives the dominant new - physics contributions from states with masses of order several times @xmath14 , in a narrow bulk - higgs scenario there is another equally important contribution arising from states with masses of order @xmath19 , which can resolve the `` bulky nature '' of the higgs boson .    in table",
    "[ tab : models ] , we have classified different versions of rs models according to the parametric relation of the characteristic width @xmath9 of the higgs - boson profile with respect to the two ratios @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath15 is the value of the inherent uv cutoff near the ir brane .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the 5d propagator for both a brane - localized scalar sector and a scalar sector that lives very near the ir brane ( narrow bulk - higgs scenario ) . to an excellent approximation",
    ", the effective @xmath64 couplings in these cases only depend on the 5d yukawa matrices @xmath67 and the ratio @xmath68 , see e.g.  ( [ ciresu ] ) and ( [ c1c5custo ] ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the results for a generic bulk - higgs model , in which the width of the higgs profile is not parametrically small , depend in a complicated way on the 5d fermion masses and the shape of the higgs profile @xcite .",
    "importantly , we have pointed out that there is no controllable interpolation between bulk - higgs and brane - higgs models . in rs models in which the scalar sector is localized on the ir brane",
    ", one finds that the gluon fusion cross section is reduced compared with its sm value , in accordance with the findings of @xcite . in this context , we have proved a conjecture made in @xcite for the analytic form of the contribution from virtual kk states . on the other hand , in models in which the higgs - boson is described in terms of a narrow bulk field localized near the ir brane , the cross section is enhanced ( apart from regions in parameter space in which the 5d yukawa matrices have very small entries ) .",
    "this result confirms the calculations performed in @xcite .",
    "the qualitative difference between the predictions obtained in the two types of scenarios provides an opportunity to distinguish between the two classes of models , provided that a deviation of the gluon fusion rate from its sm value is observed in the future .",
    "when one tries to interpolate between the bulk - higgs and brane - higgs scenarios , for instance by considering the limit @xmath10 in the context of a bulk - higgs model , one enters a transition region with @xmath69 , in which the contributions from certain higher - dimensional operators involving additional derivatives in the rs lagrangian become unsuppressed , so that the effective field - theory approach breaks down .",
    "we have furthermore addressed the question of the numerical impact of power - suppressed @xmath70 operators , which contribute to the @xmath0 amplitude at tree level .",
    "they can be induced because rs models are effective field theories valid below some cutoff .",
    "we have shown that , irrespective of whether the higgs sector is localized on the ir brane or lives in the bulk , one expects power corrections of similar size , as described by the effective lagrangian in ( [ leff ] ) with a coefficient @xmath71 that can be of @xmath72 if the uv completion of the rs model is strongly coupled .",
    "we have argued that the resulting power corrections are likely to be numerically smaller than the rs loop effects calculated in our paper .    for most of our discussion",
    "we have focused on the minimal rs model with gauge symmetry @xmath73 in the bulk .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : custodial ] we have considered an extension with a custodial symmetry , based on the gauge group @xmath74 .",
    "we have succeeded in deriving analytical expressions for the effective @xmath64 couplings in terms of the same input parameters that appear in the minimal model . due to the higher multiplicity of particles running in the loop ,",
    "the contribution from the infinite kk tower of virtual quark states turns out to be four times larger than in the minimal model .    investigating the phenomenological implications of our results , we have focused on the ratio @xmath75 representing the gluon fusion cross section in the various rs models normalized to its sm value .",
    "we have distinguished between a brane - localized and a narrow bulk - higgs field for both the minimal and the custodial rs model .",
    "we have pointed out the fact that the kk contribution to @xmath75 does not only depend strongly on the number of quark generations ( @xmath76 ) , but also on the maximal value @xmath52 one imposes on the magnitudes of the individual entries of the anarchic 5d yukawa matrices , which are assumed to be random complex numbers . to a good approximation",
    ", our results can be parameterized in terms of @xmath52 and the mass @xmath77 of the lightest kk gluon state .",
    "provided that the value of @xmath52 is not too small , we have shown that quite generically the new - physics effects in rs models can lead to significant deviations of @xmath75 from  1 , even for kk masses that are not in the reach of the lhc .",
    "this is evident from figures  [ fig : mrs ] and [ fig : crs ] , which show that significant corrections can be obtained even for kk gluon masses in the range of 1020tev . for rs models with a custodial symmetry ,",
    "whose original motivation was to lower the kk scales via a protection of the @xmath55 parameter and the @xmath78 vertex , the effects are even more pronounced . as mentioned earlier",
    ", @xmath75 is strictly less than 1 in rs models with a brane - localized scalar sector , whereas it exceeds  1 in models with a bulk - higgs field for almost all points in parameter space .",
    "comparing our predictions with the latest atlas and cms data @xcite , we have derived exclusion regions in the @xmath51@xmath52 parameter space of the various models .",
    "the corresponding results shown in figures  [ fig : mrsexcl ] and [ fig : crsexcl ] demonstrate the new - physics reach of higgs - boson observables such as @xmath75 in an impressive way .",
    "in the minimal rs model and at 95% cl , one can exclude kk gluon masses lighter than 12.8tev@xmath79 for the brane - higgs case and 4.4tev@xmath79 for the case of a narrow bulk - higgs field . in custodially protected rs models ,",
    "these bounds increase to 24.4tev@xmath79 and 9.6tev@xmath79 , respectively . especially in this latter case ,",
    "the bounds derived from higgs physics are already much stronger than those obtained from electroweak precision tests .",

    "in general , for @xmath262 fermion generations , its value @xmath263 is determined by the relation @xmath264 which holds in the sense of an expectation value for a large sample of anarchic , complex random matrices .",
    "it is instructive to reproduce condition ( [ ybound ] ) by employing a 4d picture in terms of kk modes , where the quadratic behavior on the cutoff arises from a double sum over the @xmath265 levels of states with masses below the cutoff @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath266 where we have used that the masses of the kk modes are determined by the zeroes of some bessel functions , such that the states in the @xmath267 kk level have masses approximately given by @xmath268 ( valid for large @xmath269 ) , and hence @xmath270 .",
    "the two estimates in ( [ ybound ] ) and ( [ ybound2 ] ) differ by a harmless @xmath72 factor but are parametrically equivalent ( including factors of @xmath271 ) as nda estimates . employing ( [ eq87 ] ) and solving for @xmath52 , we find the condition @xmath272 , with the upper bounds @xmath273 derived from ( [ ybound ] ) and @xmath274 derived from ( [ ybound2 ] ) . assuming as before that @xmath275 , one obtains @xmath276 in the first case and @xmath277 in the second .",
    "these estimates are somewhat more refined than those presented elsewhere in the literature ( because we include the dependence on @xmath262 ) , but they are compatible with the conventional choice @xmath278 adopted in most phenomenological analyses of rs models . using the more stringent upper bound derived from ( [ ybound ] ) , and assuming that the yukawa couplings are not much smaller than the values given by the perturbativity bound , we can rewrite condition ( [ ceffesti ] ) in the form @xmath279 which is now independent of the value of the ratio @xmath280 .",
    "this argument shows that , even if the uv completion of the rs model is strongly coupled and @xmath281 , the contributions from higher - dimensional operators are expected to be numerically much smaller than the kk loop effects , provided that the yukawa couplings are not much smaller than the perturbativity bounds .",
    "repeating the same argument for the case of an rs model in which the higgs sector lives in the bulk , we obtain from relation ( [ b33 ] ) in appendix  [ app : bulkhiggs ] the condition @xmath282 which translates into @xmath272 with @xmath283 . here",
    "@xmath284 is related to the width of the higgs profile .",
    "note that in the bulk - higgs case the suppression in the ratio @xmath280 is parametrically weaker than in the case of a brane - localized higgs field . in practice , with @xmath275 , this effect is not too important , however . even for a very broad bulk higgs with @xmath285 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath286 , which is of the same order as the bound in the brane - higgs case . in the present work we are only interested in a narrow bulk - higgs scenario ,",
    "for which @xmath287 is a small parameter ( see table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "we can then simplify @xmath288 .",
    "this formula can only be trusted as long as @xmath289 . for smaller @xmath9 ,",
    "the relevant bound is that found in the brane - higgs case , @xmath276 . from a practical point of view , there is no significant difference between the two bounds .",
