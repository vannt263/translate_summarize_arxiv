    "gradiometers , measuring the gradients of gravitational force , are capable of reading out directly the local functionals of spacetime curvature . today , gradiometry has found wide applications , especially in geodesy .",
    "the goce satellite , as an example , carried a 3-axis electrostatic gradiometer to map the geopotential of earth , whose sensitivity already reached about 10 me hz@xmath0 in the band of @xmath1 mhz , where 1 e @xmath2 s@xmath3 @xcite . with the development of more advanced superconducting @xcite and atomic gradiometers @xcite , satellite gradiometry could be employed for precision relativistic experiments to impose constraints on modern theories of gravitation .",
    "as a potential outstanding test of einstein s general theory of relativity ( gr ) , the studies of the detection of gravitomagnetic ( gm ) effects with orbiting gradiometers started in the 1980s @xcite .    within the weak field and slow motion limit , there exists rich correspondence between gr and maxwell s electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "in fact , due to the lorentz symmetry pertaining to the flat background spacetime , the analogous gm field arising from mass currents shows up in general metric theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "the detection of such gm effects can be related to fundamental issues , such as quantitative measurements of how local inertial frames are altered by nearby massive sources ( mach s principle ) @xcite .    in 2011 , nasa s gp - b team announced detection of the earth gm field with 20% accuracy @xcite by measuring the precession of freely falling gyros @xcite with respect to the direction of a guide star , hr 8703 . another experiment is to trace the relative precession of the ascending nodes of the twin satellites lageos i and ii @xcite . combining with the gravity field model provided by the champ @xcite and grace missions @xcite , ciufolini and collaborators also reported confirmation of the gm effect with the precision of 10% @xcite .",
    "different from these methods , braginskii and polnarev in 1980s derived the coupling between orbiting oscillators and the gm field of a rotating mass @xcite .",
    "it is soon noticed by mashhoon , paik and collaborators that such effect could be detected by an orbiting 3-axis gradiometer , which could fit naturally in a satellite gravity mission @xcite .",
    "having laser interferometry as an alternative readout method for gradiometry , like in the lisa pathfinder mission @xcite , a new measurement scheme to detect planetary gm effects is also under investigation @xcite .    along this line ,",
    "mashhoon and theiss claimed to have found a new relativistic nutational oscillation in the axes of gyroscopes orbiting a rotating source due to a small divisor phenomenon involving the geodetic precession frequency @xcite .",
    "such effect , known as the `` mashhoon - theiss anomaly '' , could also manifest itself in the motion of the earth - moon system @xcite , and more importantly in a `` resonance - like '' way in certain tidal tensor components @xcite . before long",
    ", it was shown @xcite that such `` anomaly '' can not be a new relativistic ( resonance ) effect related to rotating sources but appears already at the post - newtonian ( pn ) level due to an interplay between the geodetic @xcite and lense - thirring ( lt ) precession @xcite .",
    "part of the secular tidal forces were also computed with this approach @xcite .",
    "today confusions or even disagreements about this issue still remain in the literature .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to work out the _ complete pn tidal tensor _ and analyze the possible secular terms appearing _ at the 1pn level _ for future satellite gradiometry missions .",
    "this paper is continuation to those former works , in particular , completion to the classical work by mashhoon , paik and will @xcite , with the pn perturbations of the orbit and the pn precession of the local frame included . with the settings explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : settings ] , the complete 1pn tidal tensors , especially the secular tensors , are derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : the - fermi ] under the inertially guided frame of the spacecraft ( s / c ) .",
    "three kinds of relativistic precession , that is , the lt precession of the orbit , the geodetic , and the schiff ( frame - dragging ) precession of freely falling frames , will alter gradually the relative orientation of the local frame with respect to the sidereal frame , thereby producing secular changes in certain tidal tensor components through the modulations of newtonian tidal forces .",
    "these relativistic secular terms can be divided into two parts , one from the geodetic precession and the other from the combined action of the lt and schiff precession .",
    "the results for earth - pointing orientation are also worked out in sec .",
    "[ sec : earth - pointing ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , the measurements of the 1pn secular tidal forces with an on - board 3-axis gradiometer is briefly discussed .",
    "the pn coordinate system @xmath4 outside a rotating source @xmath5 is chosen as follows .",
    "the mass center of the source is set at the origin .",
    "the coordinate basis @xmath6 is set to be parallel with the direction of the source s angular momentum @xmath7 , @xmath8 is pointing to a reference star @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is determined by the right - hand rule @xmath11 .",
    "such a coordinate system is tied to remote stars , and @xmath12 is the time measured by the observer at asymptotically flat region .",
    "geometrized units , @xmath13 , are adopted hereafter . here",
    "we model the source as an ideal and uniform rotating spherical body .    in this coordinate system , the pn metric outside the source",
    "has the form @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the newtonian potential , @xmath16{3}{\\sum}(x^{n})^{2}}$ ] , and @xmath5 and @xmath17 are the total mass and angular momentum of the source .",
    "deviations from uniform sphere of the source will add multiple corrections to the newtonian potential in the above metric , whose effects can be found in @xcite , and will be ignored in this paper .    for a test mass ( or s / c ) that is orbiting around earth with velocity @xmath18 , one has basic order relations :    [ eq : orders ] @xmath19    and @xmath20 up to the 1pn level , the equation of motion of a freely falling test mass @xmath21 reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the newtonian force , and the 1pn gravitoelectric ( ge ) force and gm lorentz force have the form @xcite : @xmath24,\\label{eq : fge}\\\\ \\vec{f}_{gm } & = & 2m\\vec{v}\\times[\\frac{\\vec{j}}{r^{3}}-\\frac{3(\\vec{j}\\cdot\\vec{x})\\vec{x}}{r^{5}}].\\label{eq : fgm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity , we assume that our s / c follows an almost circular orbit .",
    "then , from the above equation of motion , we find    [ eq : orbit ] @xmath25    where the initial longitude of the ascending node @xmath26 is set to be zero , @xmath27 is the inclination angle , @xmath28 is the radius and @xmath29 with @xmath30 the proper time measured by the on - board clock and @xmath31 the orbital frequency .",
    "the orbital plane of the s / c will slowly precess due to the frame - dragging effect with a period of @xmath32 yr for medium altitude earth orbits .",
    "the effect of small eccentricity and other orbital perturbations will be left to future studies .    for two adjacent freely orbiting test masses",
    ", we introduce a vector @xmath33 pointing from the reference mass to the second . for the case of @xmath34 m , which is much shorter than the orbital semi - major @xmath35 m",
    ", the relative motion between the test masses can be obtained by integrating the geodesic deviation equation : @xmath36 here @xmath37 denotes the 4-velocity of the reference mass and @xmath38 is the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "we use @xmath39 to index the spatial tensor components and @xmath40 the spacetime tensor components .",
    "we introduce the local tetrad carried by the reference mass @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , which determines the co - moving local frame of the gradiometer .",
    "@xmath43 can be viewed as the transformation matrix from the local frame to the global pn system , and the inverse matrix is denoted as @xmath44 .",
    "the geodesic deviation equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deviation ] ) , can be expanded in such a local frame as @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the ricci rotation coefficients @xcite and @xmath47 denotes the covariant derivative associate to the metric , eq .",
    "( [ eq : metri ] ) .",
    "the second line in the above equation contains all the inertial tidal forces and coriolis forces , the third line is the tidal force from the spacetime curvature , where the tidal matrix is defined as    @xmath48    for electrostatic and superconducting gradiometers , the motions of test masses are suppressed by compensating forces .",
    "then the total tidal tensor @xmath49 affecting the gradiometer will be @xmath50    along the orbit , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : orbit ] ) , we derive the tidal matrix @xmath51 in the earth - centered pn coordinate system , which can be divided into the newtonian @xmath52 , the 1pn ge @xmath53 , the gm @xmath54 and the secular @xmath55 parts :    [ eq : k ] @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58",
    "@xmath59    this secular tidal tensor eq . ( [ eq : ks ] ) is of the 1pn level : @xmath60 during the mission life time @xmath61 , which is produced by the lt precession of the orbit relative to the earth - centered pn coordinate system .",
    "suppose the s / c is in the inertially guided orientation , which means that the local tetrad @xmath62 attached to the s / c is non - rotating and is parallel - shifted ( fermi - shifted ) along the orbit .",
    "this defines the local fermi normal frame for the gradient measurements , in which the geodesic deviation equation has a rather simple form : @xmath63 from the tidal tensor in the earth - centered pn system , eqs . ( [ eq : k ] ) , we have the order estimation : @xmath64 therefore , to evaluate the tidal tensor in the local fermi frame , we only need to find the fermi - shifted bases to the 1pn level : @xmath65      first , in the earth - centered pn coordinate system , we work out how the spatial bases @xmath66 are propagated freely along the orbit , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : orbit ] ) , and then with the boost transformations we obtain the fermi - shifted tetrad attached to the freely falling s / c . at the initial point @xmath67 , we set the origin of the fermi normal frame to sit at the mass center of the s / c , and the spatial basis @xmath68 along the initial direction of motion of the reference mass , @xmath69 along the initial radial direction , and @xmath70 along the transverse direction :    [ seq : e0 ] @xmath71    according to gr , such bases , which freely propagate along the orbit , will undergo the relativistic precession with angular velocity @xcite : @xmath72 where the first term corresponds to the geodetic precession and the second term the frame - dragging precession . at the 1pn level and in the limit @xmath73 , the precession of the normalized fermi tetrad can be shown as    @xmath74    one can see that the bases @xmath75 and @xmath76 are rotating in the orbital plane with period @xmath77 due to the geodetic effect , while the three bases are all following nutational oscillations and precession around the @xmath7 direction because of the frame - dragging effect .",
    "this is _ not a new relativistic effect _ caused by a rotating source .    by definition , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 from the differential line element @xmath80 along the orbit",
    ", we have @xmath81 then , with the boost transformation , the spatial 1pn fermi - shifted tetrad attached to the s / c reads    [ seq : emu ] @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84      with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) and the explicit expressions of the fermi - shifted tetrad , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : z])-([seq : emu ] ) , we can directly work out the total tidal tensor @xmath85 in the inertially guided local frame along the orbit .",
    "the components @xmath86 , as expected at 1pn level .",
    "therefore , the spatial parts of the newtonian , 1pn ge and gm tidal tensors read    [ eq : kabpn ] @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89    these results _ agree exactly _ with the tidal tensors evaluated _ in the non - precessing frame _ along keplerian orbits by mashhoon , paik and will @xcite .     and @xmath76 will precess to @xmath90 and @xmath91 after one turn along the orbit .",
    "therefore , the newtonian tidal forces along the bases will change gradually with time due to the continuous precession of the orientation of the bases relative to the local newtonian tidal field , which , in the limit @xmath92 , will result in the geodetic part of the secular tidal forces . ]    in this paper , we extend the analysis by _ including the frame - dragging effect_. unlike in @xcite which considered the inertial frame defined by remote stars , we now consider the _ local inertial frame _ defined by a set of on - board gyros . due to the precessing rate difference between the local frame and the orbital plane ,",
    "the relative orientation between the local freely falling frame and the sidereal frame will change gradually with time .",
    "therefore , the newtonian tidal forces along the bases @xmath93 will be modulated by such an orientation change , which results in the secular parts of the total tidal tensor .",
    "such secular tidal effects can be divided into two different parts according to their origins : the secular tensors @xmath94 and @xmath95 generated respectively by the geodetic precession and frame - dragging precession .",

    "\\label{eq : kfd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above secular tidal tensor @xmath99 from frame - dragging effect _ does not agree exactly _ with the results from mashhoon and theiss @xcite that are summarized in eq .",
    "( 12 ) of @xcite . to check the validity of these results",
    ", one should notice that , when the local , freely falling frame and the sidereal frame coincide at the initial point @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the secular tensors @xmath102 and @xmath99 should vanish .",
    "this condition is exactly satisfied by our result when @xmath101 is substituted into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kgeodetic ] ) and ( [ eq : kfd ] ) .",
    "however , such a self - consistency check is not fully satisfied for the results from mashhoon and theiss .",
    "the earth - pointing orientation of the s / c ( local frame ) is another feasible option for satellite gradiometry . strictly speaking , at the 1pn level , the exact freely falling earth - pointing frame exists only for polar orbits . along inclined orbits",
    ", there will always be periodic nutations of the local frame ( s / c ) within the orbital plane due to the frame - dragging effect .",
    "therefore , without attitude control , freely falling earth - pointing frame is only an approximation at the 1pn level .",

    "the effects and errors produced by the uncertainties in the angular velocity of the s / c relative to its mass center will be left to future studies .    if the s / c is forced to strictly follow the earth - pointing frame by attitude control , there will be no secular terms . however ,",
