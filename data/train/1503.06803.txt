    "that is , galaxies both locally and out to intermediate redshift are effectively described as one of two distinct types : red , early - type galaxies lacking significant star formation and blue , late - type galaxies with active star formation . in color - magnitude space ,",
    "the red galaxies populate a tight relation ( often called the red sequence ) , while the distribution of blue galaxies is more scattered ( sometimes referred to as the blue cloud ) . while the red and blue populations comprise approximately equal portions of the cosmic stellar mass budget at @xmath9 , galaxies on the red sequence",
    "dominate today , following a growth in stellar mass within the red population of roughly a factor of @xmath10 over the past @xmath11 gyr @xcite . despite uncertainty regarding the particular physical process(es ) at play , the suppression ( or quenching ) of star formation in blue galaxies , thereby making them red , is one of the principal drivers of this dramatic growth in the number density of quiescent systems at late cosmic time .    at both low and intermediate redshift , the local environment of a galaxy",
    "is known to be well - correlated with the suppression of star formation , such that passive or quiescent galaxies preferentially live in higher - density environments @xcite .",
    "while the stellar mass or surface mass density of a galaxy may be more closely connected to quenching for massive systems @xcite , recent work has shown that environment is likely the dominant driver of quenching at the lowest mass scales ( @xmath12 , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , studies comparing satellite galaxies to isolated field systems of similar stellar mass in the local universe find that satellites tend to exhibit lower star formation rates , more bulge - dominated morphologies , as well as older and more metal - rich stellar populations @xcite",
    ". this observed suppression of star formation in satellite galaxies is commonly referred to as `` environmental quenching '' . at present ,",
    "galaxy formation models fail to reproduce this environment - dependent effect in detail , with both semi - analytic and hydrodynamical models overpredicting the number of quenched satellites at low masses @xcite .    understanding",
    "the physics of environmental quenching is complicated by the wide range of physical processes that could be responsible for suppressing star formation in low - mass satellites .",
    "for example , various quenching mechanisms preferentially operate on satellite galaxies within overdense environments , including [ _ i _ ] `` starvation '' or `` strangulation ''  whereby gas accretion onto a satellite galaxy is halted following infall , thus eventually eliminating the fuel for star formation @xcite , [ _ ii _ ] `` harassment ''  by which close encounters between densely packed cluster or group members strip gas from around the interacting galaxies @xcite , and [ _ iii _ ] `` ram - pressure stripping ''  where the cold dense gas at the center of a satellite ( or the hot halo surrounding it ) is removed from the galaxy as a result of a high - speed interaction with the hot gas halo of the host @xcite . to further complicate matters , each of these processes may be important in different host halos and at different satellite mass scales . in an attempt to differentiate between these various physical mechanisms , we aim to measure the timescale upon which satellite quenching occurs across a broad range of satellite stellar mass . throughout this work ,",
    "we define this quenching timescale ( @xmath13 ) relative to the time at which a satellite was accreted onto its current host system ( i.e.  relative to the infall time of the satellite ) . while quenching via starvation",
    "will proceed according to the available cold gas reservoir for star formation within an accreted satellite , ram - pressure stripping will largely act on a timescale set by the density distribution of the host s hot halo and infall velocity of the satellite .",
    "as such , constraining the timescale for satellite quenching may therefore serve as a critical step towards differentiating between various physical mechanisms .    by comparing satellite samples at low and intermediate redshift to galaxy and dark matter - only simulations , several recent analyses of satellites at high stellar mass ( @xmath14 ) point towards relatively long quenching timescales of several gyr or more @xcite .",
    "remarkably , when pushing this analysis to lower masses ( @xmath15 ) , @xcite find that quenching remains surprisingly inefficient , such that the average quenching timescale increases to @xmath16  gyr . here , we extend these previous analyses of quenching timescales to yet lower masses by studying the satellite galaxies of the local group . through comparison to simulations",

    "finally , in  [ sec : discussion ] and  [ sec : summary ] , we discuss the implications of our analysis , including a `` back of the envelope '' explanation of the underlying physics operating on low - mass satellites and a summary of our main results .",
    "in assembling our sample of milky way and m31 satellites , we utilize the compilation of local dwarf galaxy properties presented by @xcite . to minimize the potential impact of incompleteness at low masses , we limit our analysis to those dwarfs with measured stellar masses in the range @xmath17 ; however , as discussed in more detail below , including systems at lower masses has very little impact on our qualitative or quantitative results .",
    "from this population of local dwarfs , satellite systems are selected to be within @xmath18  kpc of the milky way or m31 and bound with respect to their host  i.e.  @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the escape velocity at a radial distance of @xmath21 for an nfw halo with a concentration ( @xmath22 ) of @xmath23 and a total halo mass of @xmath24 . to account for potential tangential motion ,",

    "for instance , field dwarfs such as ngc 6822 , leo t , and phoenix , which are nearly in our stellar mass limits , are located significantly beyond our radial selection limit ( i.e.  @xmath29  kpc from the milky way ) . moreover , while the observed line - of - sight velocity of leo i suggests that it may be unbound ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vlos ] ) , recent proper motion observations conclude that the system is very likely bound to the milky way even at a distance of more than 250  kpc @xcite .",

    "fig : h1 ] ) .",
    "this criterion leads to only one satellite in our sample , ic 10 , categorized as currently star - forming and yields a quenched fraction of @xmath31 for satellites bound to the milky way and m31 in the selected mass range .",
    "alternative definitions of quenched versus star - forming  e.g.  using star - formation histories derived from photometric observations of spatially - resolved stellar populations @xcite or star - formation rates inferred from h@xmath32 emission @xcite yield similar results .",
    "moreover , our measurement of the satellite quenched fraction is not strongly dependent on the adopted mass range , as the quenched fraction is largely unchanged if we extend the lower mass limit down to @xmath33 so as to account for potential uncertainties or scatter in the stellar mass measurements . over this expanded stellar mass range ,",

    "when including these four lower - mass systems in our sample , the resulting quenched fraction remains quite high ( @xmath34 ) ; furthermore , pushing to yet lower masses will similarly yield little variation in the quenched fraction , as the lowest - mass satellites in the local group are universally quenched ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "abundance matching , a common technique for populating simulated dark matter distributions with galaxies , assumes a one - to - one relation between a galaxy s stellar mass and the mass of its parent dark matter ( sub)halo @xcite . while this simple empirical approach to modeling galaxy formation yields great success for massive galaxies , matching a wide range of clustering statistics as a function of cosmic time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it potentially breaks down at low masses , where the most massive subhalos of milky way - like simulations are inconsistent with the observed dynamics of nearby dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "while uncertainties remain in the potential efficacy or robustness of abundance matching prescriptions at low masses , our results are largely unaffected by changes in the assumed stellar mass - halo mass relation . as our fiducial model",
    ", we adopt the abundance matching relation of @xcite , which in our stellar mass range ( @xmath61 ) yields @xmath62 subhalos as candidate satellite hosts within a typical elvis parent halo ( after removing stripped or disrupted subhalos ) .",
    "when applying the shallower stellar mass - halo mass relation from @xcite , the number of potential subhalo hosts increases accordingly , but the quantitative and qualitative results with regard to satellite quenching remain unchanged . to account for potential increased scatter in the abundance matching relation at low masses , we also mimic scatter in the @xcite relation , by broadening the range of halo masses associated with the observed stellar mass range , randomly selecting @xmath62 subhalos within @xmath63 as satellite hosts . again , while this biases the subhalo population to lower masses , our results with regard to satellite quenching remain unaffected .",
    "independent of the particular abundance matching prescription , we account for satellites that have been tidally - stripped or disrupted  and thus not included in our observational sample  by restricting our analysis to subhalos for which @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the current ( @xmath66 ) maximum circular velocity for the halo and @xmath67 is the value of @xmath65 when the halo mass is at its maximum . while a halo s maximum halo mass generally occurs prior to infall",
    "( typically at @xmath68 ) , @xmath67 is a good approximation for @xmath69 since a halo s mass , in general , does not change appreciably prior to infall @xcite . by restricting our analysis to present - day halos with @xmath70",
    ", we eliminate all subhalos ( i.e.  satellites ) that have lost greater than @xmath36 of their mass since infall , thereby selecting those subhalos that are within the desired mass range and are highly likely to currently host dwarf galaxies ( i.e.  not disrupted or significantly stripped ) .",

    "the elvis merger trees include @xmath73 snapshots from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , providing time resolution of roughly @xmath76  myr .",
    "as discussed in more detail in  [ sec : models ] , we are interested in using elvis to explore models where satellite quenching occurs at a fixed physical radius from the host ( e.g.  within @xmath77  kpc radially ) . the crossing time on such scales ( @xmath78  kpc ) , however , is typically greater than the median time resolution of the snapshots , such that subhalos would potentially pass into and back out of the quenching radius between two successive snapshots . to more precisely determine subhalo orbits within elvis , we map the spatial position of each subhalo ( relative to its host ) at @xmath79  myr intervals by spline interpolating the position of each subhalo and corresponding host halo across each of the @xmath73 snapshots .",
    "this interpolation also allows us to determine the time at which each subhalo was accreted onto its host halo ( i.e.  the infall time or @xmath80 ) at greater precision . due to the linear spacing of the elvis snapshots with scale factor ( i.e.  non - linear spacing with lookback time ) , the difference in the measured infall time between our interpolated data and that inferred from the standard elvis merger trees depends upon the lookback time at which a subhalo is accreted . for systems with @xmath81  gyr , which place the strongest constraints on the satellite quenching timescale",
    ", the difference in @xmath80 is relatively modest , with a median offset of less than @xmath82  gyr for our fiducial sample of subhalos .",
    "as highlighted in  [ sec : intro ] , observations of low - mass galaxies in the local universe suggest that all isolated ( or `` field '' ) systems at @xmath83 are star - forming .",
    "thus , all quenching at these low masses is likely driven by environmental effects associated with dwarf galaxies being accreted onto more massive halos , such as that of the milky way or m31 .",
    "two likely quenching mechanisms operating on satellite systems are starvation , where future gas accretion onto the satellite is halted following infall into a more massive host halo , and ram - pressure stripping , where the cold gas in a satellite galaxy is violently removed via interaction with the hot gas halo of the host . to mimic these respective processes , we implement two quenching models in the elvis simulations : ( _ i _ )  a `` starvation '' model in which quenching depends only on time since infall into the host halo and ( _ ii _ )  a `` stripping '' model in which quenching occurs once a satellite reaches a fixed physical distance from the host .    ) as a function of lookback time for those subhalos in the elvis simulations identified as hosts of the local group satellites at @xmath84 .",
    "the solid black line corresponds to our default selection criteria , where subhalos are selected according to the abundance matching relation of @xcite , restricting to those subhalos with @xmath85 and within the host virial radius at @xmath86 .",
    "the dashed cyan and magenta lines show the corresponding distribution of infall times when applying alternative abundance matching prescriptions ( see   [ sec : elvis ] ) , while the dashed gold line traces the accretion history of only those subhalos within @xmath87 at @xmath88 following the @xcite abundance matching relation . a quenched fraction of @xmath36 today , as observed for the local group at these masses , corresponds to a quenching timescale ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath89  gyr . ,",
    "width=331 ]          when quenching occurs via starvation , the satellite galaxy is deprived of any additional supply of cold gas after infall , such that star formation is halted following the consumption of its current gas reservoir  i.e.  quenching occurs within the gas depletion timescale ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "while observations suggest that atomic and/or molecular depletion timescales may vary with galaxy mass @xcite , we adopt a fixed quenching timescale ( following infall ) over the limited stellar mass range probed in our analysis ( @xmath17 ) .    in the models ,",
    "we define the infall time as the lookback time at which a halo _ first _ crosses the virial radius , @xmath91 , of the host . for the @xmath92 of subhalos that cross the host virial radius more than once , we are likely overestimating the infall time",
    ". however , @xmath36 of these subhalos are accreted for a final time @xmath93",
    "gyr ago , thereby contributing little to no effect on the final inferred quenching timescale .",
    "figure  [ fig : tinfall ] shows the cumulative distribution of infall times for subhalos selected as hosts of local group satellites in the simulations following various abundance matching prescriptions .",
    "universally , we find that subhalos are accreted relatively uniformly over cosmic time , with the vast majority infalling into their host halo @xmath94  gyr ago .    as shown in figure  [ fig : tinfall ] , to match the observed satellite quenched fraction of @xmath95 in the local group , the starvation model  independent of the adopted abundance matching prescription ",
    "favors a quenching timescale ( @xmath13 ) of roughly @xmath96  gyr , including the error associated with the uncertainty in the observed local group quenched fraction ( according to binomial statistics ) .",
    "thus , on average , satellites of the milky way and m31 ( at @xmath97 ) must quench within @xmath98  gyr of infalling onto their respective host halo . within the individual elvis simulations",
    "there is non - negligible scatter in the derived quenching timescale , given the stochasticity of subhalo accretion events ; assuming a quenched fraction of @xmath36 , the @xmath99 scatter in @xmath13 across the @xmath28 local group - like host pairs in elvis is approximately @xmath100  gyr .",
    "a quenched fraction of @xmath36 in the local group could be dependent on completeness of the dwarf sample in this mass range , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "this is particularly true around m31 , where pandas imaging only surveys the volume within a radius of @xmath101  kpc . to test the impact of this potential selection effect on our results",
    ", we also compute the distribution of infall times for those subhalos that reside within @xmath87 today . while simulated subhalos with earlier infall times are slightly biased towards smaller host - centric distances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the correlation between radial distance from the host and infall time exhibits significant scatter , such that the quenching timescale derived from subhalos within @xmath87 today is fully consistent with that based on the full sample of subhalos within @xmath102 ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : tinfall ] ) .    in our starvation model , it is assumed that the quenching timescale ( i.e.  depletion timescale ) is independent of cosmic time .",
    "while studies at higher redshift are limited to significantly more massive systems , current work suggests that molecular depletion timescales are relatively weakly dependent on redshift @xcite , favoring shorter timescales at higher @xmath103 .",
    "this conclusion is echoed in analysis of the satellite quenching timescale across a broad range of halo masses at intermediate redshift @xcite .",
    "altogether , a modest variation in the quenching timescale with redshift would yield no significant impact on our results , as our analysis is focused on the cumulative quenched fraction today and not on the detailed quenching times of individual satellites .      to mimic quenching via ram - pressure stripping ,",
    "we implement a model in which satellites are quenched at a fixed radial distance ( @xmath104 ) from their host . in a stripping scenario ,",
    "this radial quenching scale would be set by the volume over which the host s hot halo reaches a density capable of stripping an infalling dwarf . to account for growth of the hot halo over cosmic time , we define our quenching radius , @xmath105 , in terms of the host s virial radius as a function of redshift ( i.e.  @xmath106 ) and require that a subhalo cross within the quenching radius at @xmath107 , allowing the host s hot halo time to form @xcite . for subhalos in elvis that have crossed within the quenching radius at @xmath107 ,",

    "these relatively short molecular depletion timescales are in direct conflict with the derived quenching timescales for satellites at @xmath139 , which indicate that star formation typically continues for @xmath140  gyr after infall . given that strong variation in star - formation efficiency for @xmath135 is disfavored by both observations of the kennicutt - schmidt relation @xcite and the bimodality of rest - frame galaxy colors ( or specific star formation rates , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the extended star formation in satellite galaxies seemingly must be driven by a fuel supply beyond the molecular reservoir .",
    "while gas cooling from a satellite s hot halo could replenish the fuel supply for star formation , there is little observational evidence for significant hot gas coronae around star - forming galaxies , even at the high - mass regime and especially when restricting to gas with a sufficiently short cooling time @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if atomic gas is included as a potential fuel source for star formation , there may be better agreement between the expected gas depletion and satellite quenching timescales .",
    "as previously stated , star formation is observed to follow molecular gas density more closely than atomic gas density , although the weaker correlation with hi surface density could be largely due to atomic gas spanning a broader range of densities , thus on average tracing dense star - forming clouds more poorly @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : cartoon]a , when including the atomic gas component , the inferred quenching timescales at high stellar masses ( @xmath141 ) are in broad agreement with the measured and predicted ( atomic plus molecular ) gas depletion timescales and thus consistent with a picture where satellite quenching is driven by starvation at high masses .    in the low - mass regime ( @xmath130 ) , the atomic component becomes increasingly important , with observations of nearby star - forming systems finding that the typical hi gas fraction increases steadily towards lower mass @xcite .",
    "more importantly , this relative growth in atomic gas outpaces the corresponding increase in the average specific star formation rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such that the gas depletion timescale is generally long ( @xmath142  gyr ) for low - mass star - forming galaxies  a result that is fully consistent with the dearth of quiescent field galaxies at @xmath143 @xcite . in comparison to the typical quenching timescales at low masses",
    ", however , the overabundance of atomic gas in these systems suggests that starvation alone can not drive satellite quenching at @xmath130 . instead",
    ", a secondary process , such as ram - pressure stripping , is needed to remove cool gas from infalling systems , thereby decreasing the gas depletion timescale significantly .",
    "as observations of systems such as leo i suggest @xcite , we would expect stripping to occur as a satellite infalls from @xmath144 towards pericenter , such that quenching at low masses would proceed according to the dynamical time ( @xmath145 ) , which is roughly @xmath137  gyr for a milky way - like halo today ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while a detailed analysis of the efficacy of ram - pressure stripping ( or other quenching mechanisms such as tidal forces ) is beyond the scope of this work ( see fillingham et al .  in prep ) , figure  [ fig : cartoon]b presents a qualitative depiction of the potential physical processes at play , where satellite quenching is primarily driven by starvation at higher masses ( @xmath146 for the local group ) while ram - pressure stripping becomes increasingly effective below a critical mass scale of @xmath147 , yielding shorter quenching timescales and high observed quenched fractions .",
    "in this qualitative picture , we expect that ram - pressure stripping ( or some other efficient quenching mechanism ) plays a critical role in suppressing star formation down to the mass scales at which reionization inhibits gas accretion and therefore star formation ( perhaps , @xmath148 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "applying this qualitative picture to higher - mass host halos ( e.g.  rich groups and clusters ) , the critical scale at which ram - pressure stripping becomes effective should move to higher satellite masses due to the increased density of the host s hot halo in concert with higher infall velocities for the satellites .",
    "comparing observations of the local group satellite population to corresponding high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations from the elvis suite , we investigate the typical timescale ( following infall ) upon which star formation is suppressed in low - mass ( @xmath149 ) satellite galaxies . when combining our work with complementary analyses of higher - mass satellite populations , we present a comprehensive picture of satellite quenching spanning roughly five orders of magnitude in stellar mass .",
    "our principal results are as follows :    * to reproduce the high fraction of quenched low - mass satellites in the local group , the typical quenching timescale at @xmath2 must be relatively short ( @xmath150  gyr ) .",
    "+ * the longer quenching timescales inferred for higher - mass satellites are roughly consistent with the observed cold gas ( @xmath151 plus hi ) depletion timescales in corresponding field systems ; this suggests that satellite quenching is largely driven by starvation at @xmath141 . + * at low masses ( @xmath152 ) , the much shorter satellite quenching timescales are potentially set by ram - pressure stripping or some other process that removes the cold gas reservoirs in infalling systems , such that nearly all low - mass satellites in the local group ( or more massive host halos ) are quenched . *",
    "if ram - pressure stripping is responsible for increasing the satellite quenching efficiency at low masses ( @xmath4 ) within the local group , we expect that this critical quenching scale will shift to higher satellite masses in higher - mass host halos ( e.g.  rich groups and clusters ) due to the increased density of the host s hot halo in concert with higher infall velocities for the satellites .",
    "we have suggested here that the transition to rapid quenching in the smallest satellites ( @xmath152 ) is potentially explained as a ram - pressure scale ( see figure  [ fig : cartoon ] and fillingham et al .  in prep ) . above this scale ,",
    "satellite quenching occurs on a gas depletion time , as accreted galaxies are starved of fresh fuel for star formation . below this scale , a more rapid , drag - induced stripping becomes dominant , such that the gravitational restoring force of lower - mass dark matter halos can no longer retain cool gas against the fluid pressure they experience while in orbit around a larger host .",
    "the idea that local group dwarfs are quenched via ram pressure has been around for some time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but the evidence for very rapid quenching provided here adds further argument in its favor , and identifies a characteristic mass scale where it may become dominant . underlying this hypothesis is the notion that the milky way and m31 both harbor extended ( @xmath153 kpc ) reservoirs of hot baryons with sufficient density to strip small galaxies of their gas .",
    "there is evidence that m31 does indeed host an extended circumgalactic medium @xcite , and x - ray studies are consistent with this possibility around the milky way @xcite .",
    "if extended low - density coronae of this kind are common around @xmath154 galaxies , then they may prove important for understanding the baryon cycle and the global census of baryons in the universe .",
    "of course , one shortcoming of our analysis is that we have restricted ourselves to satellites of m31 and the milky way . given completeness issues , the local group is a reasonable starting point , but it remains possible that satellites in our vicinity are unusually quenched , perhaps owing to an uncommonly dense distribution of hot baryons in our vicinity , or atypically early infall times for the local group satellite population .",
    "ongoing efforts to discover and characterize dwarf satellite systems around other massive hosts will be important for solidifying the existence of a sharp transition scale at @xmath152 , where satellite quenching appears to become extremely efficient in the local group .",
    "if future studies reveal that the local group is indeed typical , then pinpointing the origin of this quenching scale and testing the ram - pressure hypothesis will be of utmost importance .",
