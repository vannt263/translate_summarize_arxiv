    "the long time effort of the physics community to understand the origin of mass has now produced an outstanding result , as the discovery at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) of a higgs boson with a mass of roughly 125 gev has finally been confirmed by both the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations .",
    "while this is an extraordinary outcome of the cern machine operations , one of the primary questions that we need to ask now is whether this particle corresponds to the higgs boson embedded in the standard model ( sm ) or else belongs to some beyond the sm ( bsm ) scenario .",
    "in fact the sm suffers from a key theoretical drawback , the so - called  hierarchy \" problem , pointing out that the it could be a low energy effective theory valid only up to some cut - off energy @xmath0 .",
    "the latter can well be at the tev scale , hence in an energy range accessible at the lhc , so that new physics could be discovered at the cern machine in the coming years .",
    "for this reason many bsm scenarios , which could be revealed at the tev scale , were proposed in the last decades , the most popular being supersymmetry ( susy ) that solves the instability of the higgs mass under radiative corrections by predicting new particle states in the spectrum , differing from the sm ones by half unit of spin , i.e. , by postulating a symmetry between fermions and bosons @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the new susy particles with respect to the sm ones is such that the higgs mass becomes stable to all orders in perturbation theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that the higgs particle may be a composite state arising from some strongly interacting dynamics at a high scale instead of being an elementary state .",
    "this will solve radically the hierarchy problem owing to compositeness form factors taming the otherwise divergent growth of the higgs mass upon quantum effects .",
    "furthermore , the now measured light mass of this potentially composite higgs state is consistent with the fact that the latter could arise as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) from a particular coset of a global symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "models with a composite higgs state arising as a pngb generally predict modifications of its couplings to both bosons and fermions of the sm @xcite , hence the measurement of these quantities represents a powerful way to test the possible non - fundamental nature of the newly discovered state .",
    "furthermore , the presence of additional particles in the spectrum of such composite higgs models leads to both mixing effects with the sm states as well as new feynman diagram topologies both of which would represent a further source of deviations from the sm expectations .    the advantages of an electron - positron collider with respect to a hadron collider ,",
    "e.g. , the cleanliness of the environment , the precision of the measurements and the large number of higgs bosons produced , make an analysis of the prospect of these types of machine in disentangling the fundamental from the composite nature of the higgs boson of primary importance in view of a future decision of the physics community regarding the new generation of accelerators .    for this reason , in this note we will be analysing the generic potential of the proposed @xmath1 colliders in testing a particular realisation of a composite higgs model , the so - called 4-dimensional composite higgs model ( 4dchm ) of ref .",
    ". we will therefore borrow energy and luminosity configurations from machines prototypes such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) , the compact linear collider ( clic ) and the triple large electron - positron ( tlep ) collider .",
    "the plan of the paper is at follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the features of the model we have chosen .",
    "[ sec : results ] illustrates our analysis and presents our results .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] summarises our findings .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the salient features of the 4dchm , that is , the specific realisation of the composite higgs model with partial compositeness @xcite that we have chosen for our analysis .",
    "the 4dchm is an effective low - energy lagrangian approximation that represents an extremely deconstructed version of the minimal composite higgs model ( mchm ) described in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the @xmath2 coset that gives four pngbs , one of which being the physical higgs state .",
    "the explicit breaking of the @xmath3 global symmetry via linear mixing between the sm and new fields give rise to a radiative higgs potential _",
    " la _ coleman - weinberg @xcite and hence to a mechanism of dynamical electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . the particular choice of the fermionic sector of the 4dchm makes the higgs potential ultra - violet ( uv ) finite at one loop and , remarkably , for a natural choice of the model parameters , it has the correct form to provide ewsb @xcite and a higgs boson mass compatible with the experimental value of the new state discovered at the lhc .",
    "the extra @xmath4 gauge group present in the model implies 11 new vectorial degrees of freedom among which 5 are neutral and @xmath5 are charged gauge bosons , collectively called @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the choice of the four fundamental representations of @xmath8 ( called @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) that build up the fermionic sector gives 20 new fermions , 16 with standard electric charge , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , denoted collectively as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , and 4 with exotic charges , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , denoted collectively as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . in our notation ,",
    "the new particles present in the 4dchm in addition to the sm ones are then the following :    * neutral gauge bosons : @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) * charged gauge bosons : @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 ) * charged @xmath11 fermions : @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) * charged @xmath12 fermions : @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) * charged @xmath15 fermions : @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) * charged @xmath16 fermions : @xmath29 ( with @xmath28 )    together with the sm matter and gauge fields and neglecting the @xmath30 part that is left untouched with respect to the sm ( besides the fact that also the new spin @xmath31 resonances carries colour charge and so the corresponding qcd terms ought to be added ) the 4dchm is described by the following lagrangian @xmath32 in @xmath33 the covariant derivatives with respect to the sm @xmath34 fields and the extra @xmath35 fields , with coupling @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are given by @xmath38 the link fields @xmath39 in the unitary gauge are given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the pngb matrix and the @xmath42 s are the @xmath2 broken generators , with @xmath43 .    the field @xmath44 is a vector of @xmath45 that describes the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath46 and is defined as @xmath47    the @xmath48 s are the link coupling constants and @xmath49 the strong sector scale ( or ` compositeness ' scale ) , which are related through @xmath50 and the choice @xmath51 has then been made .",
    "the fermionic lagrangian @xmath52 contains kinetic terms , mass ( @xmath53 ) and interaction ( @xmath54 ) parameters between the extra fermions and also mixing parameters ( @xmath55 ) between the extra matter and the sm content .",
    "@xmath56 describes the kinetic terms of the sm fermions .",
    "being our goal the study of this particular composite higgs framework in its completeness and its detailed analysis with its full particle spectrum included , we have chosen to implement the 4dchm into numerical tools that allow one to perform dedicated analyses up to event generation .",
    "our simulations have been mainly performed with the help of the calchep package @xcite in which the model under discussion had been previously implemented via the lanhep tool  @xcite , as already illustrated in some detail in refs .",
    "moreover , since calchep only allows by default the analysis of only tree - level processes , we have also added by hand the one - loop @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 vertices ( again computed with the full model particle spectrum inside them ) .",
    "a feature specific to future @xmath1 colliders is the presence of initial state radiation ( isr ) and beamstrahlung . for the former , calchep implements the jadach , skrzypek and ward expressions of refs .",
    "regarding the latter , we adopted the parametrisation specified for the ilc project in  @xcite , that is ,    * beam size @xmath60 : @xmath61 nm , * bunch length : @xmath62 @xmath63 m , * bunch population : @xmath64 .",
    "we will be considering throughout three values for the centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy , which are standard benchmark energies for a future @xmath1 collider : @xmath65 gev , @xmath66 gev and @xmath67 tev . within the 4dchm",
    ", we have studied the phenomenology of a higgs boson obtained via the standard production mechanisms of lepton colliders : i.e. , higgs - strahlung ( hs ) from neutral vector bosons and vector boson fusion ( vbf ) ( the latter primarily onset by an off - shell charged vector boson pairs ) , as per feynman diagram shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : feynzhww ] .",
    "furthermore , we have focused the analysis on two other higgs processes , which are the specialities of future electron - positron machines : i.e. , higgs production in association with top - antitop quark pairs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : feynhtt ] ) and double higgs production , considering both the case of a second higgs boson emitted in the hs channel , @xmath68 , and the one via vbf , @xmath69 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : feynzhh ] ) . when combining production cross sections and decay branching ratios ( brs ) , our simulated data have been always related to the experimental accuracies presented in refs .",

    ", we have always assumed a luminosity of @xmath65/@xmath66/@xmath76 fb@xmath77 in correspondence to an energy of @xmath65/@xmath66/@xmath76 gev .     and",

    "initially we will confirm the results that in the so - called `` decoupling limit '' ( whereby , essentially , the additional gauge bosons and fermions present in the 4dchm particle spectrum are made sufficiently heavy ) sizable deviations from the sm couplings of the discovered higgs object are possible and may indicate indirect evidence of a composite higgs sector .",
    "however , we will eventually also argue that such decoupling does not really onset yet for values of the new particle masses pertaining to the 4dchm which are still compatible with current experimental data : i.e. , following the lhc measurement of the light higgs boson mass and the constraints from the electro - weak precision tests ( ewpts ) from lep , slc and tevatron parameter leads to a lower bound on their mass around 3 tev .",
    "however , new positive contributions to the @xmath79 parameter can relax this constraint down to 2 tev @xcite .",
    "] , primarily impinging on the fermionic and gauge sector of the 4dchm respectively , as well as the negative results from tevatron and lhc direct searches for new gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "that is , we will show that genuine 4dchm effects can not be relegated to a simple rescaling of the relevant higgs couplings , as the presence of @xmath80 and/or @xmath81 propagator effects in all the production processes analysed can not generally be neglected .",
    "this will in fact be shown to be a relevant effect for hs higgs production and production in association with @xmath73 pairs , albeit less so for single higgs production via vbf and both double higgs production channels , via hs and via vbf , the latter two being also limited in a phenomenological analysis by the poor experimental accuracies which are expected .",
    "in essence , to generalise our findings , quantitative studies of higgs boson phenomenology in composite higgs models at future electron - positron colliders can not ignore effects from realistic mass spectra .",
    "conversely , studies in the decoupling scenario remain valid so long that such mass spectra are made significantly heavy .      in recent years ,",
    "a popular approach introduced by @xcite ( for a more recent review , see also @xcite ) in order to parametrise effects of generic new physics ( np ) , has been adapted to the study of higgs couplings ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) in generic decoupling scenarios .",
    "the rationale is as follows .",
    "it is commonly accepted that any effects arising from np ( at some scale @xmath82 ) can be embedded in the sm via 6-dimensional effective operators ( thereby assuming that the new physical fields are integrated away ) , realising the aforementioned decoupling limit , so long that the probing energy is around the ew scale .",
    "then , after a specific theory is chosen , the coefficients of such effective operators can be expressed in terms of coupling modifications of the sm interactions .",
    "now , focusing onto the 4dchm as an illustrative example of composite higgs scenarios with additionally heavy matter and gauge fields , the modifications of the higgs couplings arise via three effects :    1 .   the non - linear realisation of the goldstone symmetry",
    "the mixing between sm and extra particles due to the partial compositeness mechanism ; 3 .",
    "the possibility that , in both tree - level and loop - induced processes , exchange of new particles can occur .    in the aforementioned effective approach , the first two effects are normally captured while the latter is not whenever the masses of the additional states are close to @xmath83 , as it is naturally the case . in fact ,",
    "sometimes , in current literature , even the second effect is not accounted for , so that one achieves a true decoupling of all np , i.e. , all the non - sm particle effects in the model spectrum are neglected , and the analysis consists in the trivial rescaling of the higgs couplings due to its goldstone nature .",
    "in particular , defining @xmath84 and assuming the case of the 4dchm ( i.e. , a @xmath2 coset with extra fermions in fundamental representations of @xmath45 ) , this rescaling values , for vector bosons @xmath85 and sm fermions @xmath49 , are @xcite @xmath86 in such a regime of decoupling we can also compute the values of the so - called higgs signal strengths , defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 represents anything produced in association with the higgs boson ( e.g. , @xmath89 in the case of hs and @xmath90 or @xmath1 in the case of vbf ) and @xmath91 simply labels a possible final state of the higgs boson decay ( for example @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) , and relate a measurement of the various @xmath96 s to the model parameter @xmath49 .",
    "an example of this is found in fig .",
    "[ fig : xianlc ] , limited for illustration purposes to the case of the hs process , which indeed shows that there exists sensitivity at future @xmath1 machines to the compositeness scale @xmath49 .",
    "further exercises can be performed along similar lines and various such statements can be finally made for a variety of production modes and decay channels as recently done , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .     for @xmath97 ( red ) , @xmath93 ( black ) and @xmath98 ( blue ) as a function of the model scale @xmath49 .",
    "in green is given the ratio of the inclusive @xmath99 cross section with respect to the sm value .",
    "horizontal lines represent the expected experimental accuracies for cross section times br measurements at the 250 gev ( left ) and 500 gev ( right ) stage of a future @xmath1 collider , according to refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath94 ( red dashed ) , @xmath95 ( red dotted ) , @xmath93 ( black dashed ) , @xmath100 ( blue dashed ) and @xmath101 ( blue dotted ) . ]",
    "however , in the light of our previous discussion , a legitimate question arises : does the decoupling limit represent a good approximation for interpreting the phenomenological implication of the 4dchm ?",
    "the answer is `` generally not '' . in the following",
    ", we will set out to prove this by studying the impact of the 4dchm particle spectrum onto the main higgs production and decay channels for customary values of the np scale .",
    "we have started by performing a parameter scan is lighter than @xmath102gev , this to take into account limits on the direct search of heavy quarks coming from the lhc experiments , see for example @xcite . ] for various benchmark points of our model .",
    "we have found that the largest deviations from the sm expectations arise , naturally , for the lowest possible values of @xmath103 and , correspondingly , for the lowest choices of the compositeness scale @xmath49 .",
    "we have considered @xmath49 in the tev range and fixed the @xmath104 parameter in order to have @xmath105 tev , which indeed represents an allowed configuration from both ewpts ( see , e.g. , fig .  1 of @xcite ) and direct @xmath106 searches ( see ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , notice that keeping the mass of the extra neutral vector resonance fixed renders clearer the dependence of the observable onto the compositeness scale @xmath49 .    in order to separate ( factorisable ) rescaling effects , due to both the non - linear realisation of the goldstone symmetry and the mixing between sm and extra particles , from the ones due to the additional propagators",
    ", we have introduced the @xmath107 and @xmath108 parameters for the inclusive hs production cross section as follows : @xmath109 then , by numerical computation , we have proven that , if the new class of neutral gauge bosons are completely stripped off the calculations , @xmath107 tends to @xmath110 ( equivalently , @xmath108 tends to @xmath111 ) with a negligible deviation @xmath112 due to a slight shift in the @xmath113 and @xmath114 couplings of the sm - like @xmath89 to the fermions ( herein , @xmath1 ) , due to the aforementioned mixing .",
    "since hs is generically the most useful process from which deviations of the higgs couplings from the sm values can be extracted , we are essentially making the generic statement that , even when the cm energy of the collider is below the scale of np , @xmath49 in this case , where the additional boson and fermion masses of the 4dchm naturally tend to cluster , the hs cross section is always affected by propagator effects ( see also @xcite and @xcite for studies in the context of the littlest higgs and minimal composite higgs models , respectively ) .     and",

    "we have also verified that the effect is completely due to the constructive interference term arising from the sm - like @xmath89 resonance and the @xmath139 contributions , with @xmath115 being dominant among the two extra vectors , as already mentioned .",
    "a feature of such interference effect is that the @xmath107 values are always above the expected `` reduction '' onsetting in the decoupling limit , to the point that , at @xmath138 tev for the three benchmarks and even at @xmath140gev for @xmath123gev and @xmath124gev , the @xmath107 value is above @xmath67 , which is never expected if the new resonances are totally decoupled .",
    "we have then verified that choosing a bigger @xmath141 will render the effects of the extra gauge bosons smaller until one reaches the limit in which they are completely decoupled from the theory , thereby recovering the results of @xcite although , for example , even for @xmath142  tev , the effects due to the aforementioned interference are still present and lead to deviations up to @xmath143 with respect to the scaling of the couplings , when @xmath138 tev .    as a conclusion then , we believe that a complete study of composite higgs models via the hs process should also take into account the possibility of non - decoupled spectra for the extra resonances ( in the context of composite higgs scenarios the effects of resonances , although in different processes , has already been analysed in @xcite ) .    for completeness , we have also analysed the case of vbf , where we have established that such interference effect is taking place but with inverted sign and with a contribution that is one order of magnitude lower than in the hs case .",

    "we have in particular shown that the approach of reducing the problem to a simple rescaling of sm production and decay rates and consequent extrapolations could be inaccurate in certain regions of the parameter space , as it fails to account for significant effects that can arise from mixing between sm and 4dchm particles or interference effects between the two , whenever the mass spectra of extra gauge bosons or fermions present in these scenarios are allowed to exist around the compositeness scale , as indeed natural in these scenarios .",
    "in fact , propagator effects of the additional heavy states present in composite higgs models are often the most visible signals .",
    "such an approach instead naively integrates out all heavy particles .",
    "clearly , the ensuing inaccuracies are the larger the smaller(higher ) the new particle masses(collider energies ) are . in short , for mass spectra in either or both the gauge and fermionic sectors of the 4dchm consistent with all current experimental and theoretical bounds , the effects studied here are tangible in most hallmark observables , such as higgs production in single mode via hs , vbf , in association with @xmath73 pairs as well as in ( potentially ) double higgs production , both via hs and vbf . hence",

    "<S> in this note we analyse the prospects of a future electron - positron collider in testing a particular realisation of a composite higgs model encompassing partial compositeness , namely , the 4-dimensional composite higgs model . </S>",
    "<S> we study the main higgs production channels for three possible energy stages and different luminosity options of such a machine and confront our results to the expected experimental accuracies in the various higgs decay channels accessible herein and , for comparison , also at the large hadron collider . </S>"
