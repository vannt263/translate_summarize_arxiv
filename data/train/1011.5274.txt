    "the two fundamental characteristics of the wireless medium , namely _ broadcast _ and _ superposition _ , present different challenges in ensuring secure and reliable communications in the presence of adversaries .",
    "the broadcast nature of wireless communications makes it difficult to shield transmitted signals from unintended recipients , while superposition can lead to the overlapping of multiple signals at the receiver . as a result ,",
    "adversarial users are commonly modeled either as ( 1 ) a passive _ eavesdropper _ that tries to listen in on an ongoing transmission without being detected , or ( 2 ) a malicious transmitter ( _ jammer _ ) that tries to degrade the signal quality at the intended receiver .",
    "two distinct lines of research have developed to analyze networks compromised by either type of adversary , as summarized below .    a network consisting of a transmitter - receiver pair and a passive eavesdropper is commonly referred to as the _ wiretap _ channel .",
    "the information - theoretic aspects of this scenario have been explored in some detail @xcite . in particular , this work led to the development of the notion of _ secrecy capacity _ , which quantifies the maximal rate at which a transmitter can reliably send a secret message to the receiver , without the eavesdropper being able to decode it .",
    "ultimately , it was shown that a non - zero secrecy capacity can only be obtained if the eavesdropper s channel is of lower quality than that of the intended recipient .",
    "the secrecy capacity metric for the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) wiretap channel , where all nodes may possess multiple antennas , has been studied in @xcite-@xcite , for example .",
    "there are two primary categories of secure transmission strategies for the mimo wiretap channel , depending on whether the instantaneous channel realization of the eavesdropper is known or unknown at the transmitter . in this work",
    "we assume that this information is not available , and thus the transmitter incorporates an `` artificial interference '' signal @xcite-@xcite along with the secret message in an attempt to degrade the eavesdropper s channel , as elaborated on in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the impact of malicious jammers on the quality of a communication link is another problem of long - standing interest , especially in mission - critical and military networks .",
    "a common approach is to model the transmitter and the jammer as players in a game - theoretic formulation with the mutual information as the payoff function , and to identify the optimal transmit strategies for both parties @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recent work has extended this technique to compute the optimal spatial power allocation for mimo and relay channels with various levels of channel state information ( csi ) available to the transmitters @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper , we consider a mimo communication link in the presence of a more sophisticated and novel adversary , one with the dual capability of either passively eavesdropping or actively jamming any ongoing transmission , with the objective of causing maximum disruption to the ability of the legitimate transmitter to share a secret message with its receiver .",
    "the legitimate transmitter now faces the dilemma of establishing a reliable communication link to the receiver that is robust to potential jamming , while also ensuring confidentiality from interception . since it is not clear _ a priori _",
    "what strategies should be adopted by the transmitter or adversary per channel use , a game - theoretic formulation of the problem is a natural solution due to the mutually opposite interests of the agents . unlike the jamming scenarios mentioned above that do not consider link security , the game payoff function in our application",
    "is chosen to be the ergodic _",
    "mimo secrecy rate _ between the legitimate transmitter - receiver pair .",
    "related concurrent work on the active eavesdropper scenario @xcite has focused on single - antenna nodes without the use of artificial interference , possibly operating together with additional ` helping ' relays .",
    "the single - antenna assumption leads to a much more restrictive set of user strategies than the mimo scenario we consider .",
    "the contributions of the paper are as follows : ( 1 ) we show how to formulate the mimo wiretap channel with a jamming - capable eavesdropper as a two - player zero - sum game , ( 2 ) we characterize the conditions under which the strategic version of the game has a pure - strategy nash equilibrium , ( 3 ) we derive the optimal mixed strategy profile for the players when the pure - strategy nash equilibrium does not exist , and ( 4 ) we study the extensive or stackelberg version of the game where one of the players moves first and the other responds , and we also characterize the various equilibrium outcomes for this case under perfect and imperfect information .",
    "these contributions appear in the paper as follows .",
    "the assumed system model and csi assumptions are presented in the next section .",
    "the strategic formulation of the wiretap game is described in section  [ sec : strats ] , where the two - player zero - sum payoff table is developed , the conditions for existence of pure - strategy nash equilibria are derived , and the optimal mixed strategy formulation is discussed .",
    "the extensive version of the wiretap game with perfect and imperfect information where the players move sequentially is detailed in section  [ sec : extensive ] .",
    "outcomes for the various game formulations are studied via simulation in section  [ sec : sim ] , and conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : concl ] .",

    "we also use @xmath1 to denote expectation , @xmath2 for mutual information , @xmath3 for the transpose , @xmath4 for the hermitian transpose , @xmath5 for the matrix inverse , @xmath6 for the trace operator , @xmath7 to denote the matrix determinant , @xmath8 is the @xmath9 ordered eigenvalue of @xmath10 , and @xmath11 represents an identity matrix of appropriate dimension .",
    "we study the mimo wiretap problem in which three multiple - antenna nodes are present : an @xmath12-antenna transmitter ( alice ) , an @xmath13-antenna receiver ( bob ) , and a malicious user ( eve ) with @xmath14 antennas , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mimowiretap ] .",
    "we assume that alice does not have knowledge of the instantaneous csi of the eavesdropper , only the statistical distribution of its channel , which is assumed to be zero - mean with a scaled - identity covariance .",
    "the lack of instantaneous eavesdropper csi at alice precludes the joint diagonalization of the main and eavesdropper channels @xcite . instead , as we will show , alice has the option of utilizing all her power for transmitting data to bob , regardless of channel conditions or potential eavesdroppers , or optimally splitting her power and simultaneously transmitting the information vector and an `` artificial interference '' signal that jams any unintended receivers other than bob .",
    "the artificial interference scheme does not require knowledge of eve s instantaneous csi , which makes it suitable for deployment against passive eavesdroppers @xcite,@xcite@xcite .",
    "eve also has two options for disrupting the secret information rate between alice and bob : she can either eavesdrop on alice or jam bob , under a half - duplex constraint .",
    "when eve is in passive eavesdropping mode , the signal received by bob is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the signal vector transmitted by alice , @xmath17 is the @xmath18 channel matrix between alice and bob with i.i.d elements drawn from the complex gaussian distribution @xmath0 , and @xmath19 is additive complex gaussian noise .",
    "when eve is not jamming , she receives @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath22 channel matrix between alice and eve with i.i.d elements drawn from the complex gaussian distribution @xmath0 , and @xmath23 is additive complex gaussian noise .",
    "the background noise at all receivers is assumed to be spatially white and zero - mean complex gaussian : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 indicates bob or eve , respectively .",
    "the receive and transmit channels of the eavesdropper have gain factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "these scale factors may be interpreted as an indicator of the relative distances between eve and the other nodes .    on the other hand ,",
    "when eve decides to jam the legitimate channel , bob receives @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the gaussian jamming signal from eve and @xmath30 is the @xmath31 channel matrix between eve and bob with i.i.d elements distributed as @xmath0 . due to the half - duplex constraint , eve receives no signal when she is jamming ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "alice s transmit power is assumed to be bounded by @xmath33 : @xmath34 and similarly eve has a maximum power constraint of @xmath35 when in jamming mode . to cause maximum disruption to alice and bob s link ,",
    "it is clear that eve will transmit with her full available power @xmath35 when jamming . in the most general scenario where alice jams eve by transmitting artificial interference",
    ", we have @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the @xmath38 , @xmath39 precoding matrices for the @xmath40 information vector @xmath41 and uncorrelated @xmath42 jamming signal @xmath43 respectively . to ensure that the artificial interference does not interfere with the information signal , a common approach taken in the literature @xcite,@xcite@xcite is to make these signals orthogonal when received by bob .",
    "if alice knows @xmath17 , this goal can be achieved by choosing @xmath44 and @xmath45 as disjoint sets of the right singular vectors of @xmath17 .",
    "note that if the users have only a single antenna , the effect of the artificial interference can not be eliminated at bob , and it will degrade the snr of both bob and eve .",
    "this makes it unlikely that alice will employ a non - zero artificial interference signal when she has only a single transmit antenna , which significantly restricts alice s transmission strategy .",
    "the matrix @xmath46 may be expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the covariance matrices associated with @xmath41 and @xmath49 , respectively . if we let @xmath50 denote the fraction of the total power available at alice that is devoted to the information signal , then @xmath51 and @xmath52 . due to the zero - forcing constraint ,",
    "it is clear that any power available to alice that is not used for the desired signal @xmath16 will be used for jamming , so between the signal and artificial interference , alice will transmit with full power @xmath33 .",
    "the covariance matrices of the received interference - plus - noise at bob and eve are @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the covariance of the jamming signal transmitted by eve , @xmath55 .    note that we have assumed that alice s jamming signal ( if any ) is orthogonal to the information signal received by bob , and hence , from the point of view of mutual information , can be ignored in the expression for @xmath56 . for our purposes",
    ", we assume that alice splits her transmit power between a stochastic encoding codebook and artificial interference for every channel use in _ all _ scenarios , while bob employs a deterministic decoding function @xcite .",
    "firstly , this ensures that the general encoding and decoding architecture of the alice - bob link remains fixed irrespective of eve s actions .",
    "secondly , for a point - to - point channel without an eavesdropper ( _ i.e. , _ when the eavesdropper is jamming and not listening ) , using a stochastic codebook does not offer any advantage over a conventional codebook , but it does not hurt either , i.e. , the receiver still reliably decodes the transmitted codeword @xcite .      given the signal framework introduced above , we are ready to discuss the important issue of csi . we have already indicated that alice knows @xmath17 in order to appropriately precode the jamming and information signals via @xmath44 and @xmath57 , conceivably obtained by public feedback from bob after a training phase . at the receiver side",
    ", we will assume that eve knows the channel from alice @xmath21 and the covariance @xmath58 of the interference and noise , and similarly we will assume that bob knows @xmath17 and @xmath56 .",
    "all other csi at the various nodes is assumed to be non - informative ; the only available information is that the channels are composed of independent @xmath0 random variables .",
    "this implies that when eve jams bob , her lack of information about @xmath30 and the half - duplex constraint prevents her from detecting the transmitted signal @xmath41 and applying correlated jamming @xcite .",
    "consequently , she will be led to uniformly distribute her available power over all @xmath14 transmit dimensions , so that @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , when alice transmits a jamming signal , it will also be uniformly distributed across the @xmath60 available dimensions : @xmath61 . while in principle alice could use her knowledge of @xmath17 to perform power loading , for simplicity and robustness",
    "we will assume that the power of the information signal is also uniformly distributed , so that @xmath62 .",
    "given the above assumptions , equations  ( [ qt])-([eq : qb_qe ] ) will simplify to @xmath63 where we have defined @xmath64 .      the mimo secrecy capacity between alice and bob is obtained by solving @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the random variable counterparts of the realizations @xmath67 .",
    "given the csi constraints discussed above , such an optimization can not be performed since alice is unaware of the instantaneous values of all channels and interference covariance matrices .",
    "consequently , we choose to work with the lower bound on the mimo ergodic secrecy capacity based on gaussian inputs and uniform power allocation at all transmitters @xcite : @xmath68 where we define @xmath69 .",
    "this serves as a reasonable metric to assess the relative security of the link and to explain the behavior of the players .",
    "recall that we assume alice has instantaneous csi for the link to bob and only statistical csi for eve , and the achievability of an ergodic secrecy rate for such a scenario was shown in @xcite .",
    "using ergodic secrecy as the utility function for the game between alice and eve implies that a large number of channel realizations will occur intermediate to any changes in their strategy .",
    "that is , the physical layer parameters are changing faster than higher ( _ e.g. , _ application ) layer functions that determine the user s strategy .",
    "thus , the expectation is taken over all channel matrices ( including @xmath17 ) , which in turn provides alice and eve with a common objective function , since neither possesses the complete knowledge of @xmath70 that is needed to compute the instantaneous mimo secrecy rate .",
    "eve must decide whether to eavesdrop or jam with an arbitrary fraction of her transmit power .",
    "alice s options include determining how many spatial dimensions are to be used for data and artificial interference ( if any ) , and the appropriate fraction @xmath50 that determines the transmit power allocated to them .",
    "as described in @xcite , there are several options available to alice for choosing @xmath50 and @xmath71 depending upon the accuracy of her csi , ranging from an exhaustive search for optimal values to lower - complexity approaches based on fixed - rate assumptions .",
    "numerical results from this previous work have indicated that the achievable secrecy rate is not very sensitive to these parameters , and good performance can be obtained for a wide range of reasonable values .",
    "the general approach of this paper is applicable to essentially any value for @xmath50 and @xmath71 , although the specific results we present in the simulation section use a fixed value for @xmath71 and find the optimal value for @xmath50 based on @xmath71 under the assumption that the eavesdropper is in fact eavesdropping , and not jamming .    in section  [ sec : strats ]",
    "we show that it is sufficient to consider a set of two strategies for both players without any loss in optimality .",
    "in particular , we show that alice need only consider the options of either transmitting the information signal with full power , or devoting an appropriate amount of power and signal dimensions to a jamming signal .",
    "on the other hand , eve s only reasonable strategies are to either eavesdrop passively or jam bob with all her available transmit power .",
    "we will denote eve s set of possible actions as @xmath72 to indicate either `` eavesdropping '' or `` jamming , '' while alice s will be expressed as @xmath73 to indicate `` full - power '' devoted to the information signal , or a non - zero fraction of the power allocated to `` artificial interference . ''",
    "the secrecy rates that result from the resulting four possible scenarios will be denoted by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    assuming gaussian inputs @xmath41 and @xmath77 , the mimo secrecy rate between alice and bob when eve is in eavesdropping mode is @xmath78 whereas the secrecy rate when eve is jamming reduces to @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the transmission strategies available to alice .",
    "we refer to  ( [ eq : payoff_j ] ) as a secrecy rate even though there is technically no eavesdropper , since eve s mutual information is identically zero and alice still uses a stochastic encoder ( cf .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) .",
    "therefore , when evaluating the secrecy rate definition ( 11 ) for the case where eve chooses to jam , the second term is zero which yields @xmath81 and @xmath82 in ( [ eq : payoff_j ] ) as the effective secrecy rate .",
    "recall that the definition of the secrecy rate is the maximum transmission rate which can be reliably decoded by bob while remaining perfectly secret from eve , which is still satisfied by the rates in ( [ eq : payoff_j ] ) .",
    "note also that when alice employs artificial interference , a choice for @xmath50 and @xmath71 must be made that holds regardless of eve s strategy .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath50 and @xmath71 that are numerically computed to maximize @xmath83 in ( [ eq : payoff_e2 ] ) @xcite remain unchanged for @xmath82 in ( [ eq : payoff_j ] ) .",
    "when alice transmits with full power , then @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , and the precoder @xmath44 consists of the right singular vectors of @xmath17 corresponding to the @xmath86 largest singular values .    while alice uses the same type of encoder regardless of eve s strategy , achieving the rates in  ( [ eq : payoff_e2])-([eq : payoff_j ] ) requires adjustments to the code rate that _ will _ depend on eve s actions .",
    "for example , if alice is transmitting with full power ( strategy @xmath87 ) , the code rate needed to achieve either @xmath88 or @xmath81 in  ( [ eq : payoff_e2 ] ) or  ( [ eq : payoff_j ] ) will be different .",
    "thus , we assume that alice can be made aware of eve s strategy choice , for example through feedback from bob , in order to make such adjustments)-([eq : payoff_j ] ) will be valid . ] .",
    "such behavior is not limited to just alice and bob ; eve also makes adjustments based on alice s choice of strategy .",
    "in particular , when eve is eavesdropping , her method of decoding alice s signal will depend on whether or not alice is transmitting artificial interference .",
    "we do not consider adjustments such as these as part of alice or eve s strategy _ per se _ , which in our game theory framework is restricted to the decision of whether or not to use artificial interference .",
    "we assume that minor adaptations to the coding or decoding algorithm for alice and eve occur relatively quickly , and that any resulting transients are negligible due to our use of ergodic secrecy rate as the utility function .",
    "the more interesting question is whether or not alice and eve decide to change strategies based on the actions of the other is addressed in section  [ sec : extensive ] .    in the game - theoretic analysis of the next two sections",
    ", we will utilize the following general properties of the mimo wiretap channel :    1 .",
    "@xmath89 2 .",
    "@xmath90    the validity of ( _ _ p__2 ) is obvious ; if alice employs artificial interference , it reduces the power allocated to the information signal , which in turn can only decrease the mutual information at bob .",
    "since eve is jamming , her mutual information is zero regardless of alice s strategy , so @xmath82 can never be larger than @xmath81 .",
    "the validity of ( _ _ p__1 ) can be established by recalling that alice chooses a value for @xmath50 that maximizes @xmath83 , assuming eve is eavesdropping .",
    "since @xmath91 is an available option and corresponds to @xmath88 , alice can do no worse than @xmath88 in choosing the optimal @xmath50 for strategy @xmath83 .",
    "in this section we construct the zero - sum model of the proposed wiretap game .",
    "we define the payoff to alice as the achievable mimo secrecy rate between her and bob . modeling the strategic interactions between alice and eve",
    "as a strictly competitive game leads to a zero - sum formulation , where alice tries to maximize her payoff and eve attempts to minimize it .",
    "formally , we can define a compact strategy space @xmath92 for both alice and eve : alice has to optimize the pair @xmath93 , where @xmath50 is chosen from the unit interval @xmath94 $ ] and @xmath95 ; and eve can choose her jamming power @xmath96 from the interval @xmath97 $ ] , where zero jamming power corresponds to the special case of passive eavesdropping .",
    "in other words , each player theoretically has a continuum of ( pure ) strategies to choose from , where the payoff for each combination of strategies is the corresponding mimo secrecy rate . in the following discussion ,",
    "let @xmath98 represent the choice of alice s parameters that maximizes the ergodic secrecy rate @xmath83 .",
    "the complete set of mixed strategies for player @xmath99 is the set of borel probability measures on @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath101 be the set of all probability measures that assign strictly positive mass to every nonempty open subset of @xmath100 .",
    "the optimal mixed strategy for player @xmath99 must belong to @xmath101 , since any pure strategies that are assigned zero probability in equilibrium can be pruned without changing the game outcome .",
    "furthermore , as in the case of finite games , the subset of pure strategies included in the optimal mixed strategy must be _ best responses _ to particular actions of the opponent @xcite .",
    "consider alice : when eve chooses the action of eavesdropping , @xmath102 is alice s corresponding best response pure strategy since by definition it offers a payoff at least as great as _ any _ other possible choice of @xmath103 [ cf . ( _ _ p__1 ) ] .",
    "similarly , when eve chooses to jam with any arbitrary power , alice s best response pure strategy is @xmath104 [ cf .",
    "( _ _ p__2 ) ] . therefore , these two pure strategies are alice s best responses for any possible action by eve , and it is sufficient to consider them alone in the computation of the optimal mixed strategy since all other pure strategies are assigned zero probability .",
    "a similar argument holds for eve with her corresponding best responses of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider the following strategy sets @xmath107 for the players : alice chooses between transmitting with full power for data ( _ f _ ) or devoting an appropriate fraction of power to jam eve ( _ a _ ) , described as @xmath108 .",
    "eve must decide between eavesdropping ( _ e _ ) or jamming bob with full power @xmath35 ( _ j _ ) at every channel use , represented by @xmath109 .",
    "the strategic form of the game where alice and eve move simultaneously without observing each other s actions can be represented by the @xmath110 payoff matrix @xmath111 in table  [ table : game ] .",
    "our first result establishes the existence of nash equilibria for the strategic game .",
    "_ proposition 1 _ : for an arbitrary set of antenna array sizes , transmit powers and channel gain parameters , the following unique pure - strategy saddle - points or nash equilibria ( ne ) @xmath112 exist in the proposed mimo wiretap game :    ( x^ * , y^ * ) = [ eq : prop1 ] r_ae & @xmath113 + r_fj & @xmath114 .",
    "_ proof _ : of the 24 possible orderings of the four rate outcomes , only six satisfy both conditions ( _ _ p__1)-(__p__2 ) of the previous section .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to check that only two of these six mutually exclusive outcomes results in a pure ne .",
    "if @xmath115 , then assumptions ( _ _ p__1 ) and ( _ _ p__2 ) imply the following rate ordering @xmath116 in this case , @xmath83 represents an ne since neither alice nor eve can improve their respective payoffs by switching strategies ; _ i.e. , _ the secrecy rate will decrease if alice chooses to transmit the information signal with full power , and the secrecy rate will increase if eve decides to jam .",
    "similarly , when @xmath117 , then ( _ _ p__1)-(__p__2 ) result in the rate ordering @xmath118 and @xmath81 will be the mutual best response for both players .",
    "evidently only one such ordering can be true for a given wiretap game",
    "scenario.@xmath119      proposition 1 establishes that there is no single pure strategy choice that is always optimal for either player if the inequalities in  ( [ eq : pureneorder1])-([eq : pureneorder2 ] ) are not satisfied .",
    "this occurs in four of the six valid rate orderings of the entries of @xmath111 that satisfy conditions ( _ _ p__1)-(__p__2 ) .",
    "therefore , since the minimax theorem guarantees that any finite zero - sum game has a saddle - point in randomized strategies @xcite , in such scenarios alice and eve should randomize over @xmath120 ; that is , they should adopt mixed strategies .",

    "since @xmath221 in this example , an increase in alice s transmit power also implies an increase in eve s power , which aids the hypothesis test at bob and thus alice has a better estimate of eve s move .",
    "on the other hand , eve s hypothesis test does not show the same improvement as @xmath33 increases since the ratio between data and artificial noise power remains virtually the same .",
