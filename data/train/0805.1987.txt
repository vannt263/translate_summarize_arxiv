    "the phenomenon of avoided level crossings has been discovered more than 70 years ago by j. von neumann and e.  p. wigner  @xcite . two energy levels",
    "undergo an avoided crossing under variation of a control parameter when they first approach very close to one another , and then depart from each other without crossing .",
    "the energies @xmath0 of eigenstates in closed quantum - mechanical systems are real - valued . in open systems ,",
    "the energy eigenstates are replaced by quasi - bound or resonant states with complex energies @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part determines the lifetime @xmath1 of the decaying state .",
    "the corresponding generalization of avoided level crossings are avoided _ resonance",
    "_ crossings ( arcs )  @xcite .",
    "arcs have been studied in a number of physical settings , such as laser - assisted electron - atom scattering  @xcite , predissociation dynamics of molecules  @xcite , biased multiple quantum wells  @xcite , coupled quantum dots  @xcite , quantum - dot microcavity systems  @xcite , microwave cavities  @xcite , and optical microcavities  @xcite . in the latter systems the electromagnetic modes and their frequencies play the role of eigenstates and their energies .",
    "one interesting phenomenon that can occur near arcs is the formation of fast and slowly decaying states  @xcite .    in a recent letter",
    "it has been shown that this formation of fast and slowly decaying states can be accompanied by a localization of the states along unstable ( or marginally unstable ) periodic trajectories of the underlying classical system  @xcite .",
    "this localization is somewhat similar to the well - known effect of scarring originally discovered for closed chaotic systems in the field of quantum chaos  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we discuss the change of the _ phase space structure _ of modes in optical microcavities when such localization near an arc occurs .",
    "the phase - space picture allows to clearly identify the physical mechanism of lifetime enhancement ( reduction ) : destructive ( constructive ) interference in real space leads to a reduction ( enhancement ) of intensity in the leaky region of phase space .",
    "second , we present a semiclassical explanation of the appearance of localized modes near arcs based on an augmented ray dynamics in which the goos - hnchen shift ( ghs ) is included .",
    "the ghs is a lateral shift of totally reflected beams along the optical interface  @xcite , i.e.  the points of incidence and reflection do not coincide . rather , the beam appears to travel , as an evanescent wave , a short distance through the optically thinner medium .",
    "the ghs is proportional to the wavelength  @xmath2 . in the short - wavelength limit",
    "@xmath3 the ghs therefore disappears leading to the standard ray dynamics of geometric optics . in the field of quantum chaos",

    "it is a special property of integrable systems that each trajectory is confined to a so - called invariant curve ( a torus in the full phase space ) .",
    "the invariant curve is exemplarily indicated by the thin dots in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : arc_diamond ] shows an example . instead of the formation of a long- and a short - lived mode we see a crossing in the imaginary parts which is a signature of an arc of internal type in the strong coupling regime  @xcite .    .",

    "this explains why the lifetime of mode @xmath25 is much shorter ( about a factor of 10 ) than the lifetime of mode  @xmath26 . due to their very different contributions in the leaky region",

    "the hybridised modes , e.g. @xmath23 and @xmath24 in fig .",

    "the morphology of superpositions @xmath43 is strongly influenced by the differences @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "it can be seen that the superposition @xmath60 has reduced intensity at the corner regions due to destructive interference . correspondingly , the intensity near the centre points is enhanced due to constructive interference .",

    "in the previous section we demonstrated the existence of localized modes in optical microcavities near arcs . but",

    "we interpret this shift as the goos - hnchen shift ( ghs ) .     for @xmath67 . ]    in the present section we develop a semiclassical description based on the ghs .",
    "we restrict ourselves to systems whose closed counterpart is integrable .",
    "examples are the elliptical and the rectangular cavity . as well known in the field of quantum chaos , integrable closed systems typically show level crossings rather than avoided level crossings . in the following we consider the crossing point of energy levels where the levels form a pair of degenerate levels .",
    "to do so , we use the quantum mechanical notation for the solutions of the wave equation .",
    "we demonstrate that the degeneracy of energy levels implies degenerate ray motion .",
    "degenerate ray motion takes place on resonant tori which are foliated by periodic ray trajectories , in contrast to generic tori which support quasi - periodic motion .",
    "let us consider two states each labelled by a pair of quantum numbers @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . in the limit of large quantum numbers the semiclassical ebk quantization rule  @xcite @xmath68 \\ , \\\\ e_{m_1,m_2 } & = & h[(m_1+\\frac{\\beta_1}{4})\\hbar,(m_2+\\frac{\\beta_2}{4})\\hbar]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is expected to give accurate results ; @xmath69 is the classical hamiltonian , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are maslov indices  @xcite .",
    "note that for systems with separatrices , maslov indices can be defined only locally in phase space  @xcite .",
    "however , if both states belong to the same type of classical motion then @xmath70 and @xmath71 are uniquely defined .",
    "moreover , we assume in the following that @xmath72 . in this regime we can use the taylor expansion in @xmath73 @xmath74 in the case of degenerate levels",
    "@xmath75 we can write eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor ] ) with the frequencies @xmath76 as @xmath77 since @xmath78 are integer numbers , eq .",
    "( [ eq : resonancecondition ] ) requires that the frequency ratio @xmath79 is a rational number . as a consequence",
    "the corresponding torus is resonant and composed of periodic ray trajectories .",
    "this line of arguments shows that the degeneracy of quantum levels is related to the appearance of periodic ray trajectories for the case of integrable closed systems .",
    "when an integrable system is subject to a smooth and generic perturbation then on the quantum ( wave ) side the degeneracy of the levels is lifted . as a consequence , a level crossing turns into an avoided level crossing . in the case of microcavities",
    "the perturbation is given by the open boundary which allows for leakage of light out of the cavity .",
    "on the classical ( ray ) side , a generic perturbation breaks up the resonant tori into a chain of stable periodic orbits ( ray trajectories ) surrounded by islands and unstable periodic orbits surrounded by a chaotic layer .",
    "this scenario is proven by the poincar - birkhoff theorem  @xcite .",
    "the fate of the nonresonant tori is determined by the kolmogorov - arnol@xmath80d - moser ( kam ) theorem  @xcite .",
    "it states basically that most of the nonresonant tori are conserved in the perturbed system .",
    "the basic idea here is to consider the ghs as a wavelength - dependent perturbation of the ray dynamics .",
    "the ghs is a direct consequence of the open boundary .",
    "the general scenario is as follows .",
    "the ghs creates stable and unstable periodic orbits according to the poincar - birkhoff theorem .",
    "the size of the corresponding islands surrounding the stable orbits in phase space depends on the ratio of wavelength to cavity size .",
    "we get smaller islands for larger normalized frequencies @xmath81 and larger islands for smaller @xmath82 . following the semiclassical eigenfunction hypothesis  @xcite the islands can support modes .",

    "this semiclassical description is summarized in fig .  [",
