    "we start out with a spin wave function for an even number @xmath3 of spin 1/2 sitting at fixed positions in the two - dimensional plane @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the position @xmath6 of the @xmath7th spin written as a complex number , @xmath8 labels the possible states ( ` up ' and ` down ' ) of the @xmath7th spin , and @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "is closely related to the kl state and reduces exactly to it in the case of a square lattice of infinite extent @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to as the ` cft state ' because it can be expressed as a cft correlator ( see the supplementary information ) .    an exact parent hamiltonian of @xmath12 has been derived in @xcite by use of a quite general technique relying on cft .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of interactions between all pairs and triples of spins in the system , which is challenging to achieve experimentally .",
    "one may argue , however , that deforming the hamiltonian will not dramatically change the physical properties of the ground state as long as no phase transition is crossed . with this in mind and specializing to an @xmath13 square lattice with @xmath14",
    "even , we investigate the local hamiltonian that remains after removing all long - range interactions and making all coupling strengths position independent : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the spin operator of the @xmath7th spin . as indicated in figure",
    "[ fig1]a , the first ( second ) two - body term is summed over all pairs of nearest ( next - nearest ) neighbour spins , and the three - body term , which breaks time reversal symmetry , is summed over all triangles of neighbouring spins ( for each triangle only one term is included and @xmath17 label the vertices of the triangle in the counter clockwise direction as indicated with the arrow ) . in this and the following section , we choose @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 to make @xmath21 as local as possible .",
    "the hamiltonian conserves the total spin @xmath22 and is hence @xmath23 invariant .",
    "c |c |c |c c c & & plane & + n & @xmath13 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 + 12 & @xmath27 & 0.9860 & 0.9818 & 0.9533 + 16 & @xmath28 & 0.9812 & 0.9747 & 0.9572 + 20 & @xmath29 & 0.9728 & 0.9655 & 0.9200 + 30 & @xmath30 & - & 0.9258 & 0.9361 +    to test how much the deformation of the hamiltonian affects the ground state , we compute the overlap between the ground states before and after the deformation in table [ tab1 ] column 3 . for many - body systems ,",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of spins in the system , and the hugeness of the hilbert space may easily cause states in the same phase to have poor overlaps .",
    "the fact that we obtain high overlaps for states with a few tenth of spins , on the other hand , is a strong indication that the deformation of the hamiltonian does not bring the system to a different phase .",
    "in fact , we may regard as an analytical approximation to the ground state , which is extremely helpful to see the underlying physics and to do computations for systems that are too large for exact diagonalization .",
    "we have chosen the parameters of the hamiltonian to get large overlaps , but we note that high overlaps are obtained in a broad parameter region as we show below .",
    "the model we have looked at so far is defined in the plane and hence has open boundary conditions . to investigate the topological properties of @xmath21 and the cft state , we shall also need to consider periodic boundary conditions , in which case @xmath21 is translationally invariant . on the torus ,",
    "i.e. , for periodic boundary conditions in both directions , there are two cft states , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , for which we derive explicit analytical expressions in the supplementary information . rewriting these expressions for the case of a square lattice , we find that the cft states are exactly the kl states on the torus for all @xmath14 and @xmath33 .",
    "table [ tab1 ] shows that the large overlap between the ground states of @xmath21 and the cft states also hold on the torus .",
    "fqh states are examples of topological states , and in the following we demonstrate that @xmath21 and the cft states exhibit topological properties that fit the properties of the @xmath0 laughlin state in the continuum .",
    "characteristic features of topological states are a ground state degeneracy that depends on the topology of the surface on which the states are defined , the lack of ability to distinguish the topologically degenerate states through local measurements , and a nonzero topological entanglement entropy . for fqh states in solids",
    "another important quantity is the hall conductivity .",
    "the hall conductivity is closely related to the chern number @xcite , which can also be computed for spin systems @xcite . for laughlin states",
    "the expected behaviour is a many - body chern number of the ground state manifold on the torus that is unity and spectral flow of the ground states into each other for certain choices of the lattice size under continuous twisting of the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we compute the spectrum on the torus through exact diagonalization @xcite of @xmath21 ( figure [ fig2]a ) .",
    "the exponential increase of the dimension of the hilbert space with the number of spins limits the system sizes we can consider .",
    "it is seen that the two lowest energy states approach each other as the system size is increased , and extrapolating the energy difference between the third lowest and the lowest energy state to the limit @xmath34 points to the existence of a gap in the thermodynamic limit .    for finite size systems ,",
    "the local indistinguishability of topologically degenerate states is not perfect , but the ability to distinguish the states decreases exponentially with the size of the system . in figure [ fig3 ] , we plot the deviation @xmath35 between the correlators of local operators computed for the two states on the torus for both the exact ground states and the cft states . in both cases",
    ", @xmath35 decreases with increasing system size , and for the cft states the decay is clearly exponential . we also observe that , as far as the operators appearing in the hamiltonian are concerned , @xmath35 is not small unless the lattice size is at least @xmath30 .",
    "this explains why the ground state degeneracy first appears approximately for the @xmath30 lattice in figure [ fig2]a , and the general decrease of @xmath35 in figure [ fig3 ] provides further evidence that the two lowest energies will approach each other further for larger lattices .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    ", we compute the topological entanglement entropy @xmath36 using the approach proposed in @xcite . for the @xmath0 laughlin state in the continuum , @xmath37 @xcite , and the result we get for the cft state",
    "is in perfect agreement with this value .",
    "for the exact ground state of @xmath21 , we can again only consider rather small systems , but we observe that the results approximately follow those of the cft state and also point to a nonzero value of @xmath38 .    we have computed the many - body chern number for both the exact ground states and the cft states on the torus for a @xmath29 lattice using the method described in @xcite , and in both cases we get @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ fig2]b demonstrates the flow of the ground states of @xmath21 into each other when the boundary conditions are twisted , and for the cft states this can be shown analytically .",
    "again , our findings are thus in agreement with the properties of the @xmath0 laughlin state .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , each spin in our model may represent the spin of a fermion sitting on a site in an optical lattice .",
    "let us consider the fermi - hubbard like hamiltonian @xmath40 on a square lattice , where @xmath41 annihilates a fermion with spin @xmath42 on lattice site @xmath7 , @xmath43 is a positive constant , @xmath44 is defined in figure [ fig1]b , and we choose the total number of fermions to equal the number of lattice sites .",
    "@xmath44 represents spin preserving hopping of fermions between nearest and next - nearest neighbouring sites with complex hopping amplitudes , and the second term in @xmath45 represents interactions between fermions sitting on the same site .",
    "when @xmath43 is much larger than the hopping strengths @xmath46 , we are in the mott insulating regime , where each site is occupied by a single fermion . in this limit , we can use the schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite to derive an effective hamiltonian @xmath47 acting in the space of states with only single occupancy on all sites in the same way as the heisenberg model is derived from the standard fermi - hubbard model .",
    "reexpressing @xmath47 in terms of spins , we get @xmath48 to third order in @xmath49 , where @xmath21 is given by equation with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "this is not by chance : the @xmath23 invariance of @xmath53 is automatically inherited to @xmath54 and the chirality is built into the model through the complex hopping amplitudes .",
    "the phase diagram of @xmath21 on the torus based on chern number computations for a @xmath29 lattice is depicted in figure [ fig5 ] . as the @xmath29 lattice is too small to display a clear two - fold ground state degeneracy",
    ", it may happen that the two lowest energy states are not the states that resemble the cft states .",
    "we circumvent this problem by noting that the hamiltonian is block diagonal , which allows us to select the right states based on quantum numbers as stated in the caption .",
    "the diagram displays the freedom we have to vary the coupling strengths in the hamiltonian while staying within the topological phase .",
    "in particular , it reveals a ridge with high overlap between the cft state and the ground state of @xmath21 that connects the hamiltonian studied in the previous sections with the region where @xmath55 .",
    "choosing , e.g. , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( the white square in the figure ) , we get @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and an overlap of @xmath60 .",
    "the observation that @xmath21 and @xmath53 are closely related provides some insight into how our model compares to previous proposals .",
    "specifically , @xmath53 can be seen as a sum of two free fermion models , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and a local interaction term .",
    "each of the free models has two bands of which the lowest is filled and the highest is empty .",
    "the chern number of the filled band ( which we compute using equation ( 12 ) in @xcite ) is plus or minus one for all nonzero @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the band flattening , i.e. , the ratio of the gap between the bands to the width of one of the bands , is moderate @xmath65 .",
    "our results thus show that two copies of a fermionic chern insulator with integer band filling plus local interactions can give rise to a bosonic fqh state .",
    "this behaviour is different from flat band models , where a fermionic ( bosonic ) chern insulator with flattened and fractionally filled bands plus interactions give rise to a fermionic ( bosonic ) fqh state @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that our model provides a different mechanism to get the fqh effect in lattices .",
    "the fermi - hubbard like model can be simulated in fermions in optical lattices as follows .",
    "we encode the spin up and down states in four internal hyperfine levels as shown in figure [ fig1]d . by choosing the internal states appropriately and using polarized light , it is possible to construct the optical lattice in figure [ fig1]c , where the levels shown in blue ( red ) are trapped in a potential with minima located at the white ( black ) squares of a checkerboard . as detailed in the supplementary information ,",
    "this can be done with eight laser beams travelling in the directions @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is adjustable .    in this setup",
    ", the atoms can tunnel through the potential barrier between nearest neighbour sites in the blue / red lattice , which provides a contribution to the next - nearest neighbour hopping terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "we propose to implement the nearest neighbour hopping terms by use of laser assisted tunnelling @xcite .",
    "this can be done with the three standing wave laser fields in figure [ fig1]b , which we refer to as r1 , r2 , and b3 , respectively . as explained further in the supplementary information , r1 and b3 ( r2 and b3 )",
    "induce nearest neighbour hops in the horizontal ( vertical ) direction .",
    "a hop is accompanied by a raman transition between internal states as illustrated in figure [ fig1]d .",
    "the alternating signs of the hopping amplitudes originate from the spatial oscillations of the amplitudes of r1 and r2 with a period that is twice the lattice spacing , and the @xmath68 s on the hopping amplitudes in the vertical direction appear because the amplitude of r2 is imaginary .",
    "note that it is possible to choose the internal states in such a way that the energy difference between the blue and red spin up states is the same as the energy difference between the blue and red spin down states .",
    "r1 , r2 , and b3 therefore accomplish the hops for both spin up and spin down .",
    "a particularly convenient feature of the above model and implementation scheme is that only on - site interactions are needed .",
    "these occur naturally in the optical lattice , and so the hamiltonian in equation is implemented directly .",
    "the hamiltonian captures the physics of when @xmath55 and the temperature is small compared to the gap to the first excited state , which is of order @xmath69 .",
    "the requirements regarding temperature , interactions , and hopping amplitudes are thus the same as those needed to observe the neel antiferromagnetic order in the standard fermi - hubbard model , which several groups are pursuing at the moment .",
    "even if does not exactly reproduce , it is possible that similar physics can be observed .",
    "this suggests that , e.g. , the choice @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( corresponding to the white triangle in figure [ fig5 ] ) , which leads to more moderate temperature requirements , may already give interesting results .",

    "in other words , the cft states are precisely the kalmeyer - laughlin states on the torus .",
    "we note also that the states in @xcite allow for twisted boundary conditions and therefore provide a natural way to generalize the cft states given below to this case .",
    "the cft states on the torus are obtained as linear combinations of the conformal blocks chosen in such a way that the cft states reflect the symmetries of the hamiltonian in equation ( 2 ) in the main text .",
    "specifically , we would like the cft states to be eigenstates of the translation operators , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , in the @xmath140- and @xmath141-directions . acting with @xmath138 and @xmath139 on the conformal blocks , we find after a lengthy computation that the appropriate choice for an even - by - odd lattice is @xmath142 \\psi_{\\textrm{t}1}^\\textrm{cft}(s_1,s_2,\\ldots , s_n ) \\propto\\tilde{\\psi}^\\textrm{cft}_{1/2}(s_1,s_2,\\ldots , s_n ) \\end{array } \\qquad \\textrm{(even - by - odd lattice)}.\\ ] ] for the even - by - even lattice with @xmath143 both of the conformal blocks are invariant under translations ,",

    "the main idea behind the scheme we propose to realize the optical lattice potential in figure 1c in the main text is to encode the blue ( red ) states in internal levels that interact more strongly with right ( left ) circularly polarized light than with left ( right ) circularly polarized light and then create a checkerboard pattern of regions with highest intensity of right circularly polarized light and regions with highest intensity of left circularly polarized light . since the blue and red sublattices are square lattices when viewed from the @xmath145- or @xmath146-directions , it is natural to let laser beams travel along these directions to create a standing wave pattern of intensity minima and maxima . in order to be able to control the strengths and phases of right and left circularly polarized light in the beams independently , however",
    ", the momentum vectors of the beams should have a nonzero @xmath99-component , which leads to the eight travelling directions @xmath66 mentioned in the main text .",
    "we note that @xmath147 is a particularly convenient choice because the trapping lasers then have approximately the same frequency as the fields used for inducing hops and one can use the same set of excited states for implementing the trap and for implementing the hopping terms ( the frequencies should , of course , not be exactly the same to avoid interference ) .",
    "let us demonstrate explicitly how this can be done for fermions with one valence electron , when the ground state manifold is a @xmath148 orbital , and the light fields couple the ground states off - resonantly to a @xmath149 orbital ( see figure [ figs1]a ) , which can be achieved with alkali atoms .",
    "we first create a standing wave pattern in the @xmath145-direction by adding up the fields @xmath150 where @xmath151 , @xmath152 is time , @xmath153 , @xmath154 is the polarization vector of right circularly polarized light , @xmath155 is the polarization vector of left circularly polarized light , @xmath156 is the polarization vector of @xmath99-polarized light , @xmath157 is a real parameter , @xmath158 @xmath159 is the wavelength of the fields , and @xmath118 is the frequency .",
    "note that the intensity profile of the right ( left ) circularly polarized component is proportional to @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) and that the coefficients of @xmath162 have been chosen such that the polarizations of the fields are perpendicular to the directions of travelling as it should be for light fields . as seen in the figure",
    ", the presence of the @xmath99-polarized component causes the trapping lasers to induce raman transitions between the two ground states .",
    "this undesired effect can be cancelled by adding the fields @xmath163 where the frequency @xmath119 is assumed to be slightly different from @xmath118 such that the fields do not interfere coherently .",
    "the fields @xmath164 do the same for the @xmath146-direction , where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are slightly different from @xmath118 and @xmath119 to avoid coherent interference .",
    "ground state manifold to a @xmath149 excited state manifold with polarized light .",
    "@xmath167 is the spin angular momentum , @xmath168 is the orbital angular momentum , and @xmath169 is the total angular momentum obtained by coupling @xmath167 and @xmath168 . *",
    "b * , hyperfine levels of the ground state manifold when the nuclear spin is @xmath170 .",
    "the states are labelled @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the total angular momentum obtained by coupling @xmath169 and @xmath173 , and @xmath174 is the projection of the total angular momentum on the @xmath99-axis .",
    "the choice of blue and red spin up and down states is indicated.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    eliminating the excited states with a schrieffer - wolff transformation , we get the trapping potentials @xmath175 for @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively , where @xmath178 and the detuning @xmath179 , defined in the figure , is negative ( positive ) for red ( blue ) detuning . for @xmath180 and @xmath181 , we thus conclude that @xmath176 is trapped around the minima of @xmath182 , whereas @xmath177 is trapped around the minima of @xmath183 , which gives the desired checkerboard pattern .",
    "so far , we have considered the states at the level of fine structure .",
    "assuming , as an example , that the nuclear spin is @xmath170 , which is the case for @xmath184 , the ground state manifold in fact consists of six states as depicted in figure [ figs1]b .",
    "the trapping potentials of these states are @xmath185 for @xmath186 and @xmath187 , which for red detuning ( @xmath188 ) amounts to @xmath189 we can get the desired potential by choosing the blue and red spin up and down states as shown in figure [ figs1]b . since the potentials shift the two blue states by the same amount and the two red states by the same amount , the energy difference between the blue and red spin up states is the same as the energy difference between the blue and red spin down states , which is what allows us to drive the hops of spin up and spin down with the same lasers . if this symmetry can not be achieved in a given setup , however , one can double the number of standing wave laser fields used for implementing the hops and drive the transitions independently .",
    "the energies of the states @xmath190 and @xmath191 are , in general , shifted by different amounts so that transitions to these states induced by the hopping lasers can be avoided automatically .",
    "note also that the difference between the maxima and minima of the potentials can be adjusted . for @xmath192 ,",
    "e.g. , the difference is @xmath193 for the blue lattice potential and @xmath194 for the red lattice potential .",
    "therefore @xmath195 and @xmath196 allow us to control the ratio between the tunnelling rates between nearest - neighbour sites in the blue and red lattices .",
    "finally , the energy of a fermion sitting on a blue lattice site must be different from the energy of a fermion sitting on a red lattice site to make the proposed implementation of the hopping terms work .",
    "if the contributions to this difference coming from the optical lattice potential and the field labelled b3 in the main text are not appropriate , one can control the difference by adding an additional laser field along the @xmath99-axis with right or left circular polarization .",
    "the transitions induced by the laser fields r1 , r2 , and b3 in the main text can be understood by noting that the transition amplitudes are proportional to the spatial integral of the product of the wannier functions at the two sites and the two field components that are involved in the transition .",
    "since the wannier functions decay rapidly , there are only transitions between nearby sites .",
    "let us first consider the jumps between neighbouring blue and red lattice sites induced by r1 and b3 .",
    "the transition amplitude for jumps along the @xmath141-axis vanishes because the wannier functions and b3 are even functions and r1 is an odd function with respect to reverting the @xmath140-axis around the @xmath140-coordinate of the sites .",
    "jumps along the @xmath140-axis are allowed , and since the sign of the amplitude of r1 between two neighbouring sites is alternatingly plus and minus , the signs of the hopping amplitudes also alternate .",
    "r2 and b3 similarly induce hops in the @xmath141-direction , but not in the @xmath140-direction . for the choice of hyperfine levels considered above , it is the right ( left ) circularly polarized component of b3 that is involved when a fermion in the spin up ( down ) state jumps",
    ". therefore one can make the hopping amplitudes for up and down spins equal by adjusting @xmath197 appropriately , i.e. , by adjusting the polarization state of b3 .",
    "let us also consider transitions involving one photon from r1 and one photon from r2 . in this case , the fermion can not change its internal state due to energy conservation , and it can not jump to a site of different colour .",
    "if the fermion remains at the same site , the transition amplitude is zero due to symmetry .",
    "if the transition involves a jump to a next - nearest neighbour site , there is destructive interference between absorbing a photon from r1 and emitting a photon into r2 or absorbing a photon from r2 and emitting a photon into r1 , and therefore no transitions occur .",
    "r1 , r2 , and b3 also induce transitions , where a fermion absorbs and emits a photon from the same beam without changing its internal state and either remains at the same site or jumps to a next - nearest neighbour site .",
    "the former case gives rise to the trapping in the @xmath99-direction and also slightly modifies the potential in the @xmath198-plane .",
    "the modification can , however , be made insignificant by decreasing @xmath199 and increasing @xmath197 without affecting the nearest - neighbour hopping amplitudes that are proportional to @xmath200 .",
    "the latter case gives rise to a contribution to the next - nearest neighbour hopping terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "for a given choice of @xmath197 it may happen that hops from blue to blue lattice sites occur at a different rate than hops from red to red lattice sites . as mentioned above , however , one can lower the potential barriers between the sites for the sublattice with slow jumps relative to the other to compensate ."

    "<S> the fqh effect @xcite is one of the most fundamental phenomena in strongly correlated electronic systems and a paradigm of topological behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> it has been thoroughly studied and characterized in situations , where the solid surrounding the electrons has a modest effect on their properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was possible , in part , thanks to the successful description in terms of the celebrated laughlin wavefunctions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of fqh behaviour when the lattice structure created by the solid becomes important is , however , not so deeply studied nor understood . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the interest in lattice systems @xcite has been sparked by the possibility of observing such behaviour with ultracold atoms @xcite , obtaining high - temperature quantum hall states @xcite , or even its applications in quantum information processing @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> this mechanism can be adapted to lattice systems by replacing the fractionally filled landau level by a sufficiently flat and fractionally filled chern band and adding near - neighbour interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a chern band can be obtained by a proper choice of complex hopping amplitudes and can be made flat with longer range hoppings @xcite .    here , </S>",
    "<S> we propose and investigate a different mechanism to obtain fqh states in lattice systems . </S>",
    "<S> we consider spin 1/2 particles on a square lattice with some specific short - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show , the ground state of the system is extremely well described by the kalmeyer - laughlin ( kl ) wavefunction @xcite ( the spin version of the bosonic laughlin wavefunction with landau level filling factor @xmath0 ) and exhibits the topological behaviour expected for fqh states . in particular , we consider periodic boundary conditions and analyze the ground state ( quasi ) degeneracy , its response to twisting the boundary conditions , the local indistinguishability of the ground states , and the topological entanglement entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate how our model can be implemented with ultracold atoms in optical lattices . the temperatures , tunnelling amplitudes , and interactions required to observe the exotic topological behaviour are the same as the ones required to observe the neel antiferromagnetic order in the standard fermi - hubbard model , so that our predictions can be tested with present or planned technology @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism leading to fqh states can be viewed from two perspectives . </S>",
    "<S> the first takes a spin wavefunction with appropriate topological properties ( like the kl state ) that can be built out of correlators from a conformal field theory ( cft ) ( in our case the @xmath1 wess - zumino - witten ) and for which one can derive a ( nonlocal ) parent hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian is then deformed into a local one without crossing a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the second perspective considers spin 1/2 fermions moving on a lattice with ( not necessarily flat ) chern bands and strong local interactions . </S>",
    "<S> when the lattice filling is @xmath2 for both spin up and down , a mott state is formed , and the spin state inherits the topological character of the chern bands . </S>",
    "<S> the first view may be extended @xcite to other models to obtain , e.g. , moore - read like states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second lends itself for physical implementations . </S>"
