    "a large number of reports indicates that vacancies and/or the doping with nonmagnetic ions play a main role in triggering defect - induced magnetism ( dim ) in zno@xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown experimentally and theoretically that in zno , zn vacancies ( v@xmath0 ) are the main defect that , for a concentration of @xmath1% , can trigger magnetic order at temperatures t @xmath2k.@xcite it has been suggested that room temperature magnetic order is better stabilized by hole doping zno , arguing that holes mediate the long range coupling between localized magnetic moments.@xcite    previously , lithium , as an element that can be easily incorporated into zno , was already used to produce p - type zno.@xcite however , the efficiency of p - doping with li is generally limited by the formation of compensating interstitials , the spontaneous formation of opposite - charged defects ( e.g. , cations or vacancies ) , which pin or may even decrease the fermi energy . in this case",
    "there are not enough charge carriers generated at the working temperature , increasing strongly the resistivity of the material .",
    "the work in ref .   characterized the existing defects in zno nanoparticles doped with different concentrations of li and concluded that the observed magnetic order at room temperature is related to li and zn defects , in particular li influences the formation and stabilization of zn vacancies , generating the predicted @xmath3-type ferromagnetism.@xcite    in our previous report we presented evidence of the magnetic order of the zlh wires only after h@xmath4 implantation for a minimum li concentration of 3%.@xcite the observed magnetism is due to the spin polarization of the o-2p band .",
    "this spin polarization occurs due to the proximity to the magnetic moments at the zinc vacancies .",
    "these are produced during h@xmath4 implantation and stabilized thanks to the li doping @xcite .",
    "therefore , the li concentration fixes the amount of v@xmath5 large enough to produce magnetic ordser at room temperature .",
    "we note that in general the main property used in literature to prove the existence of dim in zno is the bulk magnetization , even in small oxide structures as zno nanorods @xcite or zno nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of the importance for the future miniaturization of spintronic devices with high - temperature magnetic order and low resistivities , evidence of ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature in a single micro- or nanostructure of zno has not been reported in literature yet .",
    "the present work reports on the magneto - transport properties of low resistive li - doped zno microwires after proton implantation .",
    "we believe that the observed transport properties are of interest for the development of spintronic devices based on these materials .",
    "zno and li - doped zno microwires were prepared by a carbothermal process as explained elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the studied wires had a diameter between @xmath6 m and @xmath7 m and a length of some @xmath8 m .",
    "the percentage of li was chosen following previous reports @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath4 implantation of the zno microwires was performed in a remote hydrogen dc - plasma chamber in parallel - plate configuration during 1 hour at a current of 60  @xmath9a.@xcite assuming a displacement energy of 18.5  ev and 40  ev for zn and o in pure zno lattice @xcite srim simulation indicates that it is possible to create both v@xmath0 and o - vacancies ( v@xmath10 ) within the first 10  nm from the surface of zno due to the low energy of h@xmath11 implantation used in this work .    the pure zno and zno : li(7% ) as well as h@xmath4-implanted zno and zno : li(7% ) microwires are labeled as zno , zl , zh and zlh , respectively .",
    "single microwires were selected using an optical microscope and fixed on a si / si@xmath12n@xmath13 substrate .",
    "the electrical contacts were done by clenching gold wires with indium on the microwire providing ohmic contacts at all measured temperatures .",
    "the magneto transport measurements were performed in a he - cryostat with the possibility to apply a magnetic field of 8  t at a maximum temperature of @xmath14k .",
    "the rotating sample holder allowed us measurements of the magneto transport properties at fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the electrical current direction , which is along the main axis of the wire .",
    "electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) measurements were performed with a bruker emx micro x - band spectrometer at 9.41@xmath15ghz with an oxford esr 900 flow cryostat at temperatures from @xmath16 k in the dark and under illumination with the full spectrum of a xe - lamp .",
    "the sample volume was @xmath17mm@xmath18 loosely packed zno microwires , previous to li doping , in a standard test tube .",
    "epr spectra were simulated by using the easy spin matlab toolbox @xcite .",
    "figure [ rt ] shows the temperature dependence of the resistance of different zno wires with similar geometry .",
    "pure zno wire shows a semiconducting like behavior with @xmath19ev obtained from the fit to eq.(1 ) ( @xmath20 term ) . after doping with li ( zl )",
    ", the wire shows a highly insulating behavior having a resistance larger than @xmath21 ( shown by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ rt ] ) at all temperatures .",
    "the highly insulating behavior of zl is related to the carrier compensation by the complex formation of interstitial li ions as donors with li ions at zn places as acceptors .",
    "the zn vacancies act themselves as acceptors and could provide a p - type character to the wire @xcite .",
    "after h@xmath4 implantation the wires show a large decrease in the resistance of several orders of magnitude , see fig .",
    "[ rt ] . as in the case of",
    "h@xmath4 doped zno single crystals @xcite , the temperature ( @xmath22 ) dependence of the zlh and zh microwires can be described using a simple parallel resistor model , considering two different contributions , namely : one with the typical arrhenius dependence for semiconductors ( @xmath20 ) and an activation energy @xmath23 .",
    "the second one is given by a variable range hopping - like ( @xmath24 ) mechanism that prevails at lower @xmath22 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the vrh mechanism occurs mainly at the near surface region of the wire , whereas the bulk retains its thermally activated semiconducting behaviour with the corresponding activation energy .",
    "the equation for the total resistance based on the above described model can be written as : @xmath25^{-1}\\ ,      \\label{vrh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the fits ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ rt ] ) we obtain the following values for the zh ( zlh ) microwires : @xmath26k@xmath27 , @xmath28mev , @xmath29k@xmath27 , and @xmath30mev and @xmath31 for both . the large variation of the e@xmath32 from the undoped zno sample to the h@xmath4 treated ones is related to the extra impurity band produced by the corresponding increase in the vacancies concentration and the hydrogen doping .    according to the fits",
    "the main difference between the zh and zlh wires is in the prefactor on the vrh part .",
    "this is because the h@xmath4 implantation affects mainly the near surface region , as expected from the used implantation energy .",
    "figure [ mr ] shows the magnetoresistance ( mr ) between 0  t and 8  t magnetic field applied perpendicular to the current flow or @xmath33-axis of the zlh ( a ) and zh ( b ) microwires .",
    "figures [ mr](c ) and ( d ) show the mr for field applied parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath33-axis of zlh and zh microwires at different temperatures .",
    "the obtained results indicate : ( 1 ) for the zlh microwire a negative mr ( nmr ) of -3.2% at 10  k ( -0.5% at 250  k ) is measured at 8  t applied field , see fig .",
    "[ mr](a ) .",
    "( 2 ) at the same applied field the zh microwire presents a lower nmr of -1% at 10  k , being negligible above 50  k , see fig .  [ mr](b ) . ( 3 ) for the zlh wire the nmr at a given fixed field is non - monotonous in temperature , see fig .",
    "( 4 ) a comparison of the nmr between fields applied parallel and normal to the applied current ( which has the same direction as the main axis of the wires ) at 10  k , see figs .",
    "[ mr](c ) and [ mr](d ) , indicates that the ( absolute ) mr is smaller for parallel fields than for fields applied normal to the current .",
    "the observed variation with the angle is compatible with the anisotropic mr , usually seen in ferromagnetic systems @xcite .",
    "we found that the square root of the ( absolute ) mr of the zlh microwire decreases linearly with temperature to 120  k , at higher temperatures the mr increases again showing a maximum at @xmath34k , see fig .",
    "the large and non - monotonous change of the mr with temperature is related to different transport contributions .",
    "in particular the square temperature dependence of the mr below 120  k appears to be related to a mechanism occurring at the near surface region of the wire , where the vrh prevails .",
    "we stress that a similar behavior of the mr was observed in h@xmath4 doped zno single crystals , but the minimum of the mr ( at fixed field ) occurred at @xmath35k and the maximum at @xmath36k,@xcite instead of 125  k and 200  k as in our case , see fig .",
    "a possible origin of this effect is given below .",
    "we describe the mr field dependence of zlh wire with a semiempirical model proposed by khosla and fischer @xcite , widely used for magnetic transition metals in the past .",
    "the model takes into account two field dependent contributions .",
    "the positive mr contribution with a quadratic field dependence at low fields and saturation at high fields ( second term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ mre ] ) ) is due to two conduction bands ( usually @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) with different conductivities .",
    "the negative mr one ( first term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ mre ] ) ) is attributed to a spin dependent scattering between two sub - bands . strictly speaking it does not saturate at large fields , but its absolute value increases following a logarithmic field dependence .",
    "the semi - empirical formula is given by :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath38 are free parameters that depend on the carrier mobility , spin scattering amplitude , exchange integral conductivity and the spin of the localized moments ; @xmath41 is the resistance at zero field .",
    "the red lines of fig .  [ mr ] follow eq .",
    "( [ mre ] ) with the coefficients shown in fig .",
    "[ coe ] obtained from the fits .    in fig .",
    "[ coe](a ) the coefficients @xmath42 and in fig .",
    "[ coe](b ) the coefficient @xmath43 , obtained from the fits of eq .",
    "( [ mre ] ) to the data of the zlh wire , are shown .",
    "the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath33 decrease monotonously with the increase of temperature up to 150  k. above such a temperature they remain rather constant within the fitting error .",
    "the anomalous behaviour in the mr is mainly reflected in the dependence of the fitting parameters @xmath43 and to some extent in @xmath38 , see figs .",
    "[ coe](b ) and ( a ) .",
    "following the original model @xcite the parameter @xmath43 should be inversely proportional to the temperature .",
    "this dependence is indeed observed in the temperature range where the vrh prevails , fig .",
    "[ coe](b ) .",
    "however , this is not the case at higher temperatures . a simulation of the negative and positive contributions to the mr",
    "was done separately taking into account the obtained parameters , see fig .",
    "[ coe](c ) .",
    "we observe that the positive mr contribution decreases monotonously with temperature .",
    "however , the negative mr present the expected non monotonous behavior in agreement with fig.[mr12 ] and seems to be affected by two different contributions .",
    "the first one is active within the temperature range where the vrh mechanism overwhelms , i.e. below 150  k as the temperature dependence of the resistance suggests , see fig .",
    "the second one takes place once the carriers of the semiconductor are thermally activated , i.e. above 150 k.    since for the zno microwire and after implantation of a comparable h@xmath4 dose ( zh ) there is a vanishing of the nmr at t@xmath45 50  k , see fig .",
    "[ mr](b ) , it appears reasonable to assume that the density of v@xmath0 after implantation is smaller than that for zlh . in order to clarify the origin for a possible decrease in the v@xmath0 concentration",
    "we have studied the agglomerate of zno microwires using epr under uv - light to check for the possible existence of li impurities , which can stabilized a small amount of v@xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : epr ] shows , as an example , the signal obtained for zno recorded at 80@xmath15k under illumination .",
    "this temperature was selected due to the larger signal to noise ratio taking into account that the epr signal decreases with temperature.@xcite the intense four line spectrum at 332@xmath15mt is attributed to a @xmath46li@xmath47 center with @xmath48 and @xmath49 which can be described by a spin hamiltonian with axial symmetry @xmath50 \\right ) + \\\\",

    "the spin hamiltonian parameters of the @xmath46li@xmath47 center , @xmath59mhz , and @xmath60mhz as evaluated from the epr spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : epr ] are in good agreement with previously reported data of occupied li acceptors in zno , where the li@xmath4 substitutes zn@xmath61.@xcite    the obtained epr signal reveals , therefore the existence of li impurities in nominally pure zno . due to technical reasons",
    "is not possible , however , to use the absolute magnitude of the epr signal to obtain a value of the li content in the samples .",
    "these li impurities will help to stabilize v@xmath0 after h@xmath4 implantation .",
    "since the concentration is small the stabilized v@xmath0 concentration will be also small .",
    "this experimental result explains why magnetic order after implanting h@xmath4 in zh microwires is not observed , although a small nmr was observer at low temperatures .",
    "as previously mentioned , two different contribution must take place in the observed field dependence of resistance . to account for the negative contribution within the vrh range",
    ", the model of static magnetic polaron @xcite may be used . according to this model , shallow donors form",
    "bound magnetic polarons which overlap to create a spin - splitting in the band . at higher temperatures ,",
    "this contribution must be reduced and so the nmr , as observed .",
    "it has to be noted that for a small density of magnetic defects the vrh vanishes at the temperature of 50 k , as presented for zh wire .",
    "however , this is not the case for zlh , where the v@xmath0 density is enough to produce magnetic order within the 10 nm near surface region meanwhile the rest of the wire remains non magnetic .",
    "the magnetic order only in the near surface region will produce , therefore a dim / non - dim heterostructure . to explain the observed anomalous behaviour in the nmr of zlh",
    ", we have to considere the interface between magnetic and non magnetic regions . with the rise of temperature",
    ", it is produced an increase of carrier concentration .",
    "this increase of carriers may contribute to enhance the dim / non - dim interfacial magnetism @xcite at a certain temperature , i.e. 150 k - 200 k , and so the spin polarization resulting in more negative value of mr , see fig .",
    "this effect could help in the understanding and development of magnetic heterostructure for spintronic devices such as spin valves@xcite through magnetic semiconductors .",
    "in summary , the negative magnetoresistance of single h@xmath4- and li - doped zno microwires as well as the anisotropic magnetoresistance provide further evidence for the existence of magnetic order .",
    "the behavior of the magnetoresistance is non monotonous with temperature .",
    "this behavior could be related to an enhancement of the spin polarization occurring at the interface between magnetic and non - magnetic regions of the proton implanted li - doped microwires due to the increase of carrier concentration with temperature .",
