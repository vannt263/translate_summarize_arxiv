    "searching for the higgs boson is the most important task for the fermilab tevatron collider and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . among various higgs production mechanisms ,",
    "those induced by the bottom quark yukawa coupling are particularly important because in some extensions of the standard model ( sm ) such a coupling could be considerably enhanced and thus the production rates can be much larger than the sm predictions .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite serve as a good example of such extensions , where the coupling of the lightest @xmath3-even higgs boson ( denoted by @xmath4 ) to the bottom quark is proportional to @xmath5 @xcite and thus can be significantly enhanced by large @xmath2 .    in the production channels of the higgs boson via its coupling to the bottom quark , the process @xmath6 via @xmath7 was recently emphasized in ref.@xcite .",
    "the advantage of this process over the production via @xmath8 @xcite , the dominant production channel via the bottom quark yukawa coupling , is that the final bottom quark can be used to reduce backgrounds and to identify the higgs boson production mechanism @xcite . and",
    "compared with the production via @xmath9 @xcite , the production rate of @xmath10 is one order of magnitude larger .",
    "so the production @xmath11 may be a crucial channel for testing the bottom quark yukawa coupling .",
    "if the mssm is indeed chosen by nature , then the prediction of the cross section for the production @xmath12 @xcite must be renewed with the inclusion of susy quantum corrections because , like the process of the charged higgs boson production @xmath13 @xcite and the relevant higgs decays@xcite , the susy quantum corrections to this process may be quite large . in this work",
    "we study the one - loop susy - qcd corrections to this process , which is believed to be the dominant part in the susy corrections .",
    "it is well known that the low - energy observables in the mssm will recover their corresponding sm predictions when all sparticles as well as @xmath14 ( the mass of the cp - odd neutral higgs boson ) take their heavy limits .",
    "if only some of the masses take their heavy limits , e.g. , all sparticles are heavy but @xmath14 is light , then large remnant effects of susy may be left over in the physical observables of the higgs sector .",
    "the study of these remnant effects will serve as an important probe for those heavy susy particles @xcite .",
    "such kind of study will be performed for the process @xmath15 in this work . after deriving the susy - qcd corrections to this process",
    ", we will examine the behavior of the corrections in the limit of heavy susy masses .",
    "when @xmath14 is light and the sparticles take their heavy limits , we find the large remnant effects left over by the susy - qcd in such a higgs production process .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : calculations ] we present our strategy for the calculation of the one - loop susy - qcd corrections to the process @xmath15 . in section [ sec : results ] , we scan the parameter space of the mssm to estimate the size of the susy - qcd corrections . in section [ sec : decouple ] , we study the behaviors of these corrections in the limit of heavy susy masses . the conclusion is given in section [ sec : conclusion ] and the detailed formula obtained in our calculations are presented in the appendix .",
    "at high energy hadron colliders , the incoming @xmath16-quark is generated from gluons splitting into nearly collinear @xmath17 pairs .",
    "when one member of the pair initiates a hard - scattering subprocess , its partner tends to remain at low @xmath18 and to become part of the beam remnant .",
    "hence the final state typically has no high-@xmath19 @xmath16-quarks .",
    "when the scale of the hard scattering is large compared with the @xmath16-quark mass , the @xmath16-quark is regarded as part of the proton sea@xcite . however , unlike the light quark sea , the @xmath16-quark sea is perturbatively calculable .",
    "if the scale of the hard scattering is @xmath20 ( for the scale we use @xmath20 to distinguish from the susy parameter @xmath21 ) , the @xmath16-quark distribution function @xmath22 is intrinsically of order @xmath23 . as @xmath24 approaches @xmath25 from above , @xmath26 ;",
    "while as @xmath27 becoming asymptotically large , @xmath28 approaches order of unity and one needs to sum terms of order @xmath29 into the @xmath16-quark distribution function to yield a well - behaved perturbation expansion in terms of @xmath30 @xcite . in this case , the @xmath16-quark distribution function becomes of the same order as the light partons .",
    "the main uncertainty of @xmath16-quark distribution function comes from that of gluon distribution function which is about @xmath31 @xcite .",

    ".    it would be interesting to first scan over the allowed parameter space to figure out how large the production rate is enhanced in the mssm . in fig.[fig : scan1 ] we present the tree - level cross section relative to the sm prediction with the same higgs mass .",
    "this ratio is independent of collider energy , but is dependent on the susy mass parameters since we use the loop - corrected relations of the higgs masses and the mixing angle ( see the second paragraph of sect .",
    "ii ) . from fig.[fig : scan1 ] one sees that the production rate in the mssm can be significant larger than the sm prediction for a light @xmath142 ; while for a heavy @xmath14 the mssm prediction approaches to the sm value . this character was first noticed in @xcite and , as a result of this character , distinguishing the lightest mssm higgs boson from the sm higgs boson in the large @xmath14 limit will be very difficult .",
    "when susy - qcd corrections are added , this character remains unchanged for heavy sbottoms(see following discussions ) . from fig.[fig : scan1 ] one also finds that there exists the possibility ( although very rare ) that the mssm cross section is suppressed to be below the sm value @xcite . in this case",
    ", the susy - qcd corrections will play a more important role in higgs phenomenology at colliders @xcite .    now let us scan over the allowed parameter space to show the possible size of the susy - qcd corrections relative to the tree - level value . in our numerical evaluation",
    ", we found the relative correction is insensitive to collider energy .",
    "the difference of the results between the lhc and the tevatron is at the level of parts per mill . in fig.[fig : scan2 ] we present the susy - qcd corrections to the cross section .",
    "fig.[fig : scan2 ] manifests three features of susy - qcd corrections for large @xmath5 .",
    "the first one is that the correction size is enhanced by @xmath5 and thus can be quite large .",
    "the second one is that for @xmath14 lighter than @xmath143 gev , the correction tends to be negative .",
    "the third one is that for large @xmath14 , the correction may be positive and the maximum value seems to be independent of the value of @xmath14 .",
    "these features can be explained as follows .    for the correction size larger than @xmath144 ,",
    "the dominant contribution of the susy - qcd correction is from the loop corrections to the vertex @xmath145 and the contribution of the box diagrams is much smaller for the parameters satisfying the constraints in the paragraph following eq.([input ] ) .",
    ", the dominant contribution still comes from the corrections to the vertex @xmath146 . ] as a result , the correction behaves like ( which is similar to the susy - qcd correction to the vertex @xmath147 in case of heavy sbottoms @xcite ) @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 denote the electroweak scale and the typical mass of sbottoms , respectively . @xmath151 and @xmath152 are functions of @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 , but independent of @xmath14 .",
    "it is found that in general @xmath158 is negative and @xmath152 is positive and either @xmath158 or both @xmath158 and @xmath159 are enhanced by large @xmath5 .",
    "for a light @xmath14 compared with @xmath160 , the first term of the rhs in eq.([explain ] ) is dominant and hence the cross section tends to be negative . while for a large @xmath14 , the second term is dominant and the cross section tends to be positive .",
    "so the behavior of eq.([explain ] ) can explain the features of fig.[fig : scan2 ] .    from fig.[fig",
    ": scan2 ] we noticed that in some corners of parameter space the one - loop susy - qcd contributions to the cross section are comparable or even larger than the tree - level result and consequently , one must consider higher order corrections . in such cases , it is important to sum over the terms @xmath161 to all orders of perturbation theory by using an effective lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "next we study the dependence of the susy - qcd correction @xmath162 and the cross section normalized by the sm prediction , @xmath163 , on the mass of the produced higgs boson , which can be directly compared with experiment results and hence is much informative .",
    "in such a study we assumed a common value ( @xmath164 ) for all input susy mass parameters and , considering the fact that @xmath83 is insensitive to @xmath14 for @xmath165 @xcite , we fixed the value of @xmath14 .",
    "then through varying the value of @xmath164 , we obtain the different mass value of the higgs boson .",
    "the dependence on @xmath83 is illustrated in fig.[fig : higgs ] for @xmath166 .",
    "( note that @xmath83 can vary only in a small range since it is stringently upper bounded in the mssm . ) in this figure and also in the following figures showing @xmath103 , we also incorporated the conventional qcd corrections @xcite into both the mssm and the sm cross sections .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the susy - qcd correction @xmath167 is not sensitive to collider energy .",
    "the difference of the results between the lhc and the tevatron is too small to be visible , as shown in the upper part of fig.[fig : higgs ] .",
    "but for @xmath103 the difference between the lhc and the tevatron is visible since the qcd corrections are significantly different for these two colliders @xcite .",
    "we also studied the dependence of the production rate on the renormalization scale @xmath168 .",
    "( as pointed out earlier , we assume that the factorization scale is equal to the renormalization scale . )",
    "we found that such a scale dependence is significant in some parameter space .",
    "for example , for the lhc with @xmath169 gev and @xmath170 gev , the ratio @xmath171 is @xmath172 for @xmath173 and @xmath174 for @xmath175 .",
    "such an uncertainty is comparable with the uncertainty from the @xmath16-quark yukawa coupling ( @xmath176 ) and the partron distribution function ( about @xmath177 ) .",
    "to study the behaviors of the susy - qcd correction in the large limit of susy mass parameters , we consider four typical cases as in ref.@xcite where the decoupling property of susy - qcd correction to the coupling of @xmath57 is analyzed . to qualitatively understand the feature of each case , we present the approximate formula in the limits , but in practical numerical calculations we use the complete one - loop expressions .    about the inputs of the susy parameters ,",
    "there are several differences between our work and ref.@xcite .",
    "the first one is that in @xcite the tree - level relations for the higgs masses and the mixing angle were used , but in our calculations we use the loop - corrected relations .",
    "as discussed earlier , using the loop - corrected relations leads to a significantly different correction .",
    "the second one is that in our analysis we considered the experimental bounds in eq.([constrain ] ) .",
    "this will rule out some parameter space which have been considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "the third one is that in cases b and d we also require @xmath178 to be large since large @xmath178 is favored by the higgs mass bound .",
    "\\(1 ) _ case a : _   all susy mass parameters except @xmath14 are of the same size ( collectively denoted by @xmath179 ) and tend to heavy , i.e. , @xmath180 in this case the susy - qcd correction behaves like @xmath181 , \\label{approx1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term in the rhs corresponds to the first term in eq.([explain ] ) and at loop level , the gap between @xmath182 and @xmath183 is generally enlarged . ] and the rest corresponds to the second term in eq.([explain ] ) .",
    "the striking feature of this case is that for very large @xmath184 , the correction approaches a nonzero constant , and this remnant effect of susy - qcd corrections is enhanced by large @xmath185 .",
    "this feature is illustrated in fig.[fig : cas1a ] . from fig.[fig : cas1a ] one also finds that the susy - qcd correction in this case is negative and sizable for a light @xmath186 and a large @xmath5 .    in fig.[fig : acas1a ] we show the loop corrected cross section normalized by the sm prediction . from this figure",
    "we see that for @xmath14 of several hundred gev , although the tree - level cross section in the mssm can be reduced by large susy - qcd corrections , an enhancement of several times over the sm prediction can still be expected due to the fact that the tree - level @xmath16-quark yukawa coupling in the mssm is significantly enhanced by large @xmath2 for light @xmath142 .",
    "this large enhancement shows a very weak dependence on @xmath179 .",
    "so we can conclude that up to the next - leading order , a light @xmath14 is still able to make the mssm cross section larger than the sm prediction .",
    "\\(2 ) _ case b : _   @xmath187 @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 ( collectively denoted as @xmath191 ) is much larger than @xmath156 , @xmath192 and @xmath142 ( collectively denoted as @xmath193 ) , i.e. , @xmath194 in this case the susy - qcd correction behaves as @xmath195 .",
    "\\label{approx2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this expression we see that in the large @xmath179 limit , the susy - qcd corrections decouple rapidly as @xmath196 and the decoupling behavior is slowed down by large @xmath185 .",
    "the characters of this case are shown in fig.[fig : casb ] .",
    "so we see that even with a fixed light @xmath14 , the process still does not have remnant susy - qcd effects if the gluino mass and @xmath21 are also kept light .",
    "\\(3 ) _ case c : _   only the gluino mass gets much larger than other susy parameters ( collectively denoted as @xmath179 ) : to be much larger than electroweak scale . ] @xmath197 in this case the susy - qcd correction behaves as @xmath198 .",
    "\\label{slow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the main character of this case is that as gluino mass gets large , the correction drops very slowly like @xmath199 , which was also observed in refs.@xcite .",
    "again , like other cases , the size of the correction is enhanced by large @xmath5 . in fig.[fig : casc ] we show the dependence of the susy - qcd correction and @xmath200 on the gluino mass .",
    "note that in this case we found that @xmath201 can not satisfy the experimental bounds in eq.([constrain ] ) for @xmath202 gev . in fig.[fig : casc ] the correction size is significantly smaller than those in case a and b. the reason is that here a large @xmath14 is chosen so that @xmath203 is suppressed ( see footnote 3 ) .",
    "let us explain the origin of the slowness of the decoupling in this case .",
    "such slowness of the decoupling arises from the first term in eq.([slow ] ) , i.e. , @xmath204 ( note that the @xmath179 in the factor @xmath205 is @xmath21 and the one in the logarithm is squark mass @xmath206 ) . as @xmath207 gets much larger than @xmath206 and @xmath21 , @xmath208 decreases but @xmath209 increases . for the example shown in fig.[fig : casc ] , i.e. , @xmath207 is changing from 1 tev to 5 tev with fixed @xmath210 gev , the factor @xmath208 is decreased by @xmath211 but the factor @xmath212 is increased by 4.16 .",
    "thus the slowness of the decoupling as gluino gets heavy is caused by the enlarged mass splitting between gluino and squark .",
    "of course , since @xmath213 is proportional to @xmath214 ( see footnote 3 ) , the contribution of the first term in eq.([slow ] ) will be decoupled rapidly if @xmath14 gets large .",
    "\\(4 ) _ case d : _  one of the sbottoms and @xmath215 become heavy while other mass parameters ( denoted as m ) are fixed . we choose @xmath216 or equally @xmath217 where @xmath218 and @xmath219 are the masses of bottom - squarks and top - squarks , respectively .    in this case",
    "the susy - qcd correction behaves as @xmath220 .",
    "\\label{approx4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the main feature of this case is the correction decouples like @xmath221 and this decoupling behavior is slowed down by large @xmath222 .",
    "fig.[fig : casd ] shows the dependence of the correction and the cross section on @xmath223 ( @xmath224 ) . comparing with the results in case b ,",
    "we see that the correction size decrease more slowly as @xmath225 gets heavy .    from the above analyses we see that when @xmath14 is fixed and all other susy mass parameters get large , the susy - qcd lefts over some remnant effects in the higgs production process @xmath226 at the hadron colliders .",
    "note that for the remnant effects to be left over , @xmath21 and gluino mass must be comparable with or larger than the masses of the sbottoms .",
    "the fundamental reason for such a behavior is that the couplings like @xmath227 are proportional to susy mass parameters .",
    "we conclude this section by making a few remarks .",
    "firstly , in our analysis we assumed @xmath228 and , as a result , all four cases have negative values of the correction . in the anomaly - mediated susy breaking scenario@xcite , a negative @xmath155 is predicted and in this case , the sign of the correction may be reversed .",
    "secondly , it should be noted that in the calculations of such higgs processes it is necessary to use the loop - corrected relations of the higgs masses and the mixing angle since such relations can significantly affect the results .",
    "thirdly , in case of a light @xmath229 , although the susy - qcd corrections tend to reduce the cross section severely , the mssm cross section can still be several times larger than the sm prediction .",
    "if the cross section of this process is measured in the future and found to be several times larger than the sm prediction , a light @xmath142 is favored .",
    "in this work , we studied the one - loop susy - qcd quantum effects in the higgs production @xmath230 at the tevatron and the lhc in the framework of the mssm .",
    "we found that for a light @xmath14 and large @xmath5 , the corrections can be quite sizable and can not be neglected .",
    "we performed a detailed analysis on the behaviors of the corrections in the limits of heavy susy masses and found that when @xmath14 is fixed and all other susy mass parameters get large , the susy - qcd lefts over some remnant effects in the higgs production process @xmath226 .",
    "such remnant effects can be so sizable for a light @xmath14 that they might be observable in the future experiment .",
    "the exploration of such remnant effects is important for probing susy , especially in case that the sparticles are too heavy ( above tev ) to be directly discovered in future experiments .",
