    "in this research , we develop new means of directing colloids at an interface to assemble into complex configurations by exploiting defects in a liquid crystal ( lc ) . through confinement of a nematic lc over a topographically patterned surface ,",
    "we demonstrate the formation of defects at precise locations in the lc bulk .",
    "these defects source elastic distortion fields that guide the assembly of colloids constrained to the lc - air interface .",
    "this work significantly extends prior work in which lcs confined in film or droplet geometries guide colloidal assembly beyond simple triangular lattices and chains . here",
    ", we demonstrate colloidal assembly at precise locations , with particle rich and poor regions , determined remotely by defects deliberately seeded in the lc bulk .",
    "experimental results are supported by numerical and analytic investigation .",
    "classically , the bulk of a material system is where the action is : the interface is oft relegated to a set of  boundary conditions .",
    "\" however , crystal faceting @xcite , the quantum hall effect @xcite , and even the ads - cft correspondence @xcite fundamentally reverse this relationship  the bulk properties can be read off from their effects on the boundaries . in this contribution , we demonstrate migration and organization of colloids constrained to a liquid crystal - air interface , driven remotely by the elastic distortion created by the presence of topological defects in the liquid crystalline bulk . just as phantoms are employed in magnetic resonance imaging @xcite",
    ", it is necessary for us to prepare bulk defects in known configurations in order to verify our bulk / boundary connection . to do this",
    ", we prepare a substrate patterned with microposts that , with appropriate surface treatment , seed a reproducible defect complexion .",
    "colloidal spheres on the interface experience an attraction to the regions above the submerged defects , as well as an elastic repulsion from each other , leading to complex new assemblies .",
    "the long range of these elastic interactions allows defects in the bulk nematic phase far below the interface to direct assembly at the interface . other recent work on producing ordered arrangements of particles at liquid crystal interfaces beyond simple triangular lattices  such as chains @xcite ,",
    "stripes @xcite , and dense quasihexagonal lattices @xcite  have focused on confining the nematic in thin film or droplet geometries and varying the surface coverage fraction .",
    "our sensitive control over substrate topography provides the ability to tune the defects positions and their influence on the interface , offering a route to tunable non - trivial colloidal assemblies .    to understand the bulk s influence on the boundary , it is essential for us to first know what is on the inside . to that end ,",
    "we have carefully characterized , simulated , and analyzed the response of the nematic liquid crystal , 5cb , to the micropost - patterned substrate .",
    "we begin with a description of the sample preparation , our microscopy results , and an analytic approximation to characterize the defect complexion .",
    "we corroborate this with numerical modeling and find , to our surprise , that the connection between the boundary conditions and the substrate topography is not always entirely geometric",
    ". finally , we present our main finding : the migration and arrangement of colloids at the surface in response to disclinations in the bulk .",
    "we prepare a square array of cylindrical microposts and impose homeotropic anchoring at all surfaces , resulting in the appearance of a disclination ring around each micropost .",
    "the defect lines encircle the microposts and appear as bright lines in an otherwise black polarized optical micrograph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a . under sample rotation ,",
    "the dark regions remain black , confirming homeotropic anchoring , while bright field optical microscopy corroborates this observation ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a ) . when the sample is heated above the clearing point ( @xmath0c ) , the defect line is absorbed into the isotropic phase , resulting in a completely black image under crossed polarizers . upon cooling back to the nematic phase ( either slowly at 0.1 @xmath1c / min or in contact with the room environment ) , the disclination reappears , confirming that the texture is due to the equilibrium elasticity of the nlc and the frustrated director field near the surface of the micropost .",
    "we determine the vertical position of the disclination line using fluorescence confocal polarizing microscopy ( fcpm ) and find that , for a wide range of post heights , the disclination occurs near the mid - height position ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b ) .",
    "in addition , we deduce through fcpm that the disclination sits within @xmath2 of the micropost surface .",
    "though both bright field and polarized microscopy suggest a larger gap between the posts and defects , we believe this is an optical effect due to the curved interface and the birefringence of the lc .",
    "finally , by varying the cross section of the microposts we demonstrate that the disclination line bears the signature of the micropost shape as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]c .    what does the observed disclination ring imply about the bulk director field and the boundary conditions associated with confinement ?",
    "to address this theoretically , we study a q - tensor based , landau - de gennes ( ldg ) model of the nematic confined in micropost geometries . using a finite difference scheme to minimize the ldg free energy @xcite we determine the director field and defect locations .",
    "we use the unequal elastic constants measured for the elastic anisotropy of 5cb .",
    "we numerically model the micropost as a right cylinder bridging two planar interfaces and find four distinct local minima of the free energy : two in which there is no defect in the bulk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b and its reflection through the horizontal ) , one with a disclination ring around the micropost with @xmath3 winding geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]c ) , and one in which the disclination ring has instead a @xmath4 geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]d ) .",
    "all the minima exhibit axial symmetry and we find that the director field has no axial component as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b - d .",
    "it follows that we can discuss the topology of the texture in terms of _ two - dimensional _ nematics corresponding to each radial slice , promoting the @xmath5 geometry into a pseudo - topological charge .",
    "the disclination ring is topologically charged in the three - dimensional sense , as the director field profile is essentially constant along its contour @xcite ; we will henceforth focus exclusively on the two - dimensional pseudo - charge .",
    "the total pseudo - charge can be calculated via the winding of the director around the boundary of the sample . however , as our numerics demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the sharp corners at the cylinder - planar junctions require careful consideration of the topology in each slice .",
    "each corner can be resolved via a splay or bend texture leading to a director rotation of @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "thus the defect pseudo - charge in each radial slice is determined by the details of each junction . when the winding sense is positive at corner x and negative at corner y ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b ) or _ vice versa _ , there is no disclination ring in the bulk . on the other hand , a disclination ring of winding number @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b ) is observed at mid - height around the micropost when the two corners both have positive winding .",
    "likewise , a disclination ring of winding number @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]c ) is observed at mid - height around the micropost when the two corners both have negative winding .",
    "thus , the experimental observation of a disclination in the bulk implies that the director winding has the same sign at both corners .",
    "the nematic degree of order is diminished locally at the corners due to the incompatible boundary conditions .",
    "it should be noted that the computed free energies of the states with the bulk disclination ring ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2]c and [ fig : fig2]d ) are slightly higher than that of the states with no bulk defect ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b ) , whereas the bulk disclination is stable in experiment .",
    "a similar multistability due to sharp - cornered boundaries has been reported for nematics in square wells with planar anchoring @xcite . there",
    ", the choice of winding sense at each corner gives rise to two optically distinct states , a useful situation for bistable displays .    in the numerical model ,",
    "we can induce a local preference for a given winding sense by altering the geometry of either corner .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a shows a 5cb - air interface curving upward to meet the micropost at a nonzero pinning angle as in the experiment . as a result , bend is favored over splay and the winding is negative .",
    "conversely , curvature at the bottom of the micropost favors positive winding , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b . with this resolution of the sharp boundaries ,",
    "the bulk disclination ring is not even metastable in the numerics . to probe this",
    "experimentally , we replaced the sharp corner at x with a curved base to favor a positive winding sense ( @xmath7 ) as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b ; the surface pinning maintains the preference for negative winding at corner x. in contrast with the numerics , we find that when the base of the micropost is slightly curved ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]c ) the bulk disclination persists but is pushed away from the base , closer to the 5cb - air interface .",
    "we verify the defect position using fcpm as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]d and verify the stability of the defect by heating into the isotropic phase and re - cooling several times .",
    "each time , upon cooling into the nematic phase , the defect re - forms .",
    "further , the bulk disclination remains even when microposts are completely submerged in a thick nematic film .",
    "however , we also find that when the microposts are tapered all the way to the top ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]e - g ) , the bulk disclination ring fails to form ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]f and [ fig : fig3]g ) , as verified by fcpm , which is in agreement with the numerical results .",
    "thus , the geometry of the boundary alone is not sufficient to predict the qualitative features of the bulk director field .",
    "we suspect that variations in surface chemistry , roughness , or relative magnitudes of anchoring strength are important for the stabilization of bulk defects . on the other hand , these findings demonstrate that sensitive control over the boundary shape offers the ability to tune the stable position of the disclination ring .",
    "lateral confinement of disclination rings by neighboring microposts holds promise as a way to further manipulate the defects , as shown by studies of nematic - filled capillaries @xcite",
    ". however , simply decreasing the micropost center - to - center spacing ( even down to @xmath8 times the micropost diameter ) does not affect the existence or circular shape of the bulk disclinations .",
    "armed with our careful characterization of the complexion , we now turn to our main interest : the interaction of the liquid crystal with colloidal particles .",
    "prior work has established that colloids are attracted to disclination lines , an effect that has been exploited in the bulk to form wire - like chains of colloidal particles along the defects @xcite . here",
    "however , we use the distortion field generated by the defect to _ remotely _ steer particles trapped at the 5cb - air interface .",
    "when a @xmath9 m diameter silica microsphere with homeotropic anchoring is placed on the interface , it migrates radially toward the micropost until contact ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]a ) .",
    "though capillary interactions are known to induce particle migration along curved surfaces @xcite , capillarity effects are absent in this system since the interfacial distortions induced by the microspheres are negligible @xcite .",
    "further , when the system is heated above the nematic - isotropic transition to annihilate the disclination lines we no longer observe migration and thus conclude that the observed migration must be orchestrated solely by the elastic director field . in other words ,",
    "the elastic distortion created by the spherical particle is interacting with the bulk nematic texture .",
    "as noted in @xcite , however , the distortions made by the particles are quadrupolar in nature and die off rapidly away from the surface .",
    "thus we expect that the colloids will only interact with large director deformations . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b - d , we can imagine three potential sources of large director distortions which include a region of splay gradient along the interface due to its meniscus ; a defect line near the interface at the upper corner y ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a ) ; and the defect ring in the bulk .",
    "we can eliminate the first potential source by submerging the micropost in the liquid crystal so that it no longer intersects the nematic - air interface . yet , even without distortion of the interface , migration occurs .",
    "when several particles are present at the interface , they form a ring above the immersed micropost mimicking the bulk disclination ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]b ) .",
    "the second potential source is shown to be negligible by changes to the micropost geometry discussed below , which alter the speed of colloidal migration without changing the defect at corner y. these observations confirm that the assembly of particles at the free interface is , in fact , driven by the third source , the defect ring within the bulk liquid crystal .    as we increase the surface density of the microspheres , a single ring of colloids around each micropost ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]b and [ fig : fig4]c ) gives way to complex structures that form owing to the balance of attraction to the micropost and the long range interparticle elastic repulsion .",
    "this competition results in highly ordered structures as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]d and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]e that nucleate from the post and evolve with distance away from the post into a hexagonal lattice .",
    "since the particles migrate in creeping flow , we can estimate the interaction energy by balancing the elastic and viscous forces .",
    "we track particle trajectories and use drag coefficients implied by the brownian fluctuation of particles at the interface and the stokes - einstein relation .",
    "we infer elastic interaction energies @xmath10 @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]a ) and find that the energy falls off as the inverse square of the radial position from the post center . additionally , we test the elastic potential numerically by moving a small spherical colloid with a quadrupolar defect at fixed height near the top surface toward a micropost with a defect ring . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]b , the elastic energy is well described by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radius of the disclination ring around the micropost and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are fitted coefficients .",
    "the dependence of this potential on distance from the disclination , rather than from the center or edge of the micropost , for example , further underscores the role of the disclination as the principal cause of the elastic attraction .",
    "finally , we find that as the height increases the rate of migration decreases ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]a ) . since the disclination line is always at or below the micropost mid - height for un - tapered microposts , the reduced strength of interaction follows from the increased separation between the microspheres at the surface and the defect ring in the bulk .",
    "we confirm the latter result by measuring the variation of the elastic force magnitude @xmath16 for micropost heights of 33 @xmath17 m , 60 @xmath17 m , and 96 @xmath17 m at fixed radial position of the particle @xmath18 @xmath17 m .",
    "we find that @xmath16 decreases with values of 1.39 pn , 0.633 pn , and 0.406 pn , respectively .",
    "similarly , when the micropost base geometry is changed from a `` sharp '' base to a curved base , the defect rings are closer to the interface , and the migration rates increase .",
    "together these observations offer additional confirmation of the direct interaction of the bulk disclination and the colloids .    to summarize , we have demonstrated that bulk defects can be generated in confined liquid crystals and guide the assembly of remote colloidal particles into ordered structures through nematic elasticity .",
    "the colloids assemble to mimic the defect structure in the bulk , in this case , a ring around the micropost .",
    "even when the microposts are submerged under liquid crystal , the elastic effect of the trapped topological defects remotely organizes the colloids on the surface , allowing us to probe the interior through `` colloid - aided tomography . '' at high surface coverage , attraction to the defect ring is coupled with long range interparticle repulsion and leads to highly ordered structures that nucleate radially outward from microposts .",
