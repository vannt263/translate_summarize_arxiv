    "determining the progenitor stars that give rise to supernovae ( sne ) is at the heart of sn research and is certainly a key aspect of stellar evolution studies . without knowledge of the nature of sn progenitors ,",
    "many of the conclusions and inferences that have been made from sne on the chemical evolution of galaxies , the energy input into the interstellar medium , the production of stellar remnants such as neutron stars and black holes , the origin of cosmic rays , and even the determination of cosmological distances stand on precarious ground .",
    "the main obstacle is that a sn leaves few traces of the star that exploded .",
    "additionally , only a small handful of the more than 2000 historical sne have had pre - explosion objects identified .",
    "these include sn 1961v in ngc 1058 ( zwicky 1964 , 1965 ) , sn 1978k in ngc 1313 ( ryder et al .",
    "1993 ) , sn 1987a in the lmc ( e.g. , gilmozzi et al .  1987 ; sonneborn , altner , & kirshner 1987 ) , sn 1993j in m81 ( aldering , humphreys , & richmond 1994 ; cohen , darling , & porter 1995 ) , and sn 1997bs in m66 ( van dyk et al . 1999b , 2000 ) .",
    "it should be noted that these five sne were all at least somewhat unusual , and both sn 1961v ( goodrich et al .",
    "1989 ; filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ; but see also van dyk , filippenko , & li 2002a ) and sn 1997bs ( van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ) may not have been actual sne ( defined to be the catastrophic explosion of a star at the end of its life ) .",
    "sne are characterized optically by the presence or absence of h in their spectra near maximum brightness : the type ii sne ( sne  ii ) and type i sne ( sne  i ) , respectively .",
    "sne  i further divide into sne  ia , which are characterized by a deep absorption trough around 6150    produced by blueshifted si  ii @xmath46355 , and sne  ib / c , which do not show this trough .",
    "sne  ib exhibit strong he  i absorption , while sne  ic show little or no evidence for he  i absorption .",
    "the sne  ii also include various subtypes : sne ii - plateau ( ii - p ) and ii - linear ( ii - l ) , based on the shape of their light curves ( but with associated spectral characteristics as well ; schlegel 1996 ; filippenko 1997 ) , and sne ii - narrow ( iin ) , which lack the blueshifted component of the broad balmer - line p - cygni profiles , but instead show a relatively narrow emission component atop the broad one .",
    "sne iib may be a bridge between the sne ii and ib / c , possessing properties of each .",
    "( see filippenko 1997 for a thorough review of sn spectra and types . )",
    "sne ia are thought to arise from the thermonuclear deflagration and/or detonation of a white dwarf , but they are not the focus of this paper .",
    "sne ii and ib / c probably arise from the collapse of the fe core toward the end of the life of a massive ( @xmath5 ) star . whereas it is generally agreed that sne ii must arise from the explosions of hydrogen - rich supergiant stars , the progenitors of sne ib / c",
    "have not been unambiguously identified .",
    "clearly , sne ib / c must arise from stars that have lost most or all of their hydrogen envelopes . as such , wolf - rayet stars have been proposed as possible progenitors ( see branch , nomoto , & filippenko 1991 , and references therein ) .",
    "alternatively , uomoto ( 1986 ) , nomoto , filippenko , & shigeyama ( 1990 ) , podsiadlowski , joss , & hsu ( 1992 ) , iwamoto et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and nomoto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have explored massive gas - transferring binary systems as possible sn ib / c progenitors .",
    "( another possibility , now considered much less likely , are off - center explosions of white dwarfs ; branch & nomoto 1986 . )    part of the evidence for the core - collapse nature of sne  ii and ib / c comes from theoretical modelling ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1986 , 1995 ) , but indications that these sne have massive - star progenitors also stems from the few that have had progenitors directly identified : for sn 1961v , an extremely luminous ( @xmath6 mag ) star ( bertola 1964 ; zwicky 1964 ; klemola 1986 ) ; for sn iin 1978k , a reddish star , with @xmath7 mag and @xmath8 mag ( ryder et al .  1993 ) ; for sn ii - p 1987a , a massive blue supergiant ( e.g. , woosley 1988 ) ; for sn iib 1993j , a red supergiant , possibly in a binary system ( podsiadlowski et al .",
    "1993 ; aldering et al .  1994 ;",
    "van dyk et al .",
    "2002b ) ; and for sn iin 1997bs , a supergiant star with @xmath9 mag ( van dyk et al .  1999b , 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , young sn remnants , such as cas a ( e.g. , fesen , becker , & blair 1987 ; fesen & becker 1991 ; garca - segura , langer , & mac low 1996 ) , clearly point toward massive progenitors .    evidence for massive progenitors has also been accrued from the environmental data for many sne .",
    "van dyk ( 1992 ) and van dyk , hamuy , & filippenko ( 1996 ) provided statistics of the association of sne ii and ib / c with massive star - formation regions , from ground - based imaging .",
    "more recently , barth et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and van dyk et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) have exploited the superior spatial resolution afforded by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) to resolve individual stars in sn environments and place constraints on the progenitor ages and masses .",
    "based on the properties of the surrounding stellar association , van dyk et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , in particular , concluded that the progenitor of the sn ii - l 1979c in m100 had an initial mass @xmath1018 @xmath11 . using _",
    "hst _ images of sn 1993j in m81 to remove contamination by neighboring stars of the ground - based estimates of the progenitor brightness ( aldering et al .",
    "1994 ) , van dyk et al .",
    "( 2002b ) constrain the progenitor mass to be @xmath121322 @xmath11",
    ".    clearly , direct identification of the progenitors of additional core - collapse sne is essential .",
    "van dyk et al .",
    "( 1999b , 2000 ) were able to directly identify the progenitor star for sn 1997bs using _ hst _ archival images .",
    "however , at that point in time the quantity of archival data in which pre - sn images might exist for recent sne was extremely small .",
    "we can now reap the benefits from the confluence of two circumstances : the increasing data volume in the _ hst _ archive and the success of modern sn search programs , in particular , the lick observatory sn search ( loss ; li et al .",
    "1999 ; filippenko et al . 2001 ) and the lick observatory and tenagra observatory sn searches ( lotoss ; schwartz et al .",
    "2000 ; beutler et al . 2002 ) , with which two of us ( w.d.l . &",
    "are involved and which are discovering new sne at a remarkable rate ( e.g. , 65 in 2002 january  september ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss our attempt to isolate the progenitors of 16 core - collapse sne ( 6 sne  ii and 10 sne  ib / c ) using _ hst _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images of galaxies .",
    "it will only be through the accumulation of a statistically significant number of direct identifications of progenitor stars for both sne  ib / c and sne  ii that we finally will be able to adequately test the various models for massive stellar evolution and inevitable explosion .",
    "we began by cross - referencing historical sne with the _ hst _ archive .",
    "we compiled a list of core - collapse events , all since about 1997 through 2002 june , which might contain the progenitor star in at least one wfpc2 image .",
    "a summary of the available data is in table 1 .",
    "the crux of this work is determining at which location on the four chips of the image array the star should be .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to have high astrometric accuracy for all the images .",
    "ideally , one could pinpoint the exact sn location by comparing a late - time image of the sn with a pre - sn image .",
    "in fact , in three cases below , we have been able to do this .",
    "however , even locating the fading sn in _ hst _ images is often quite difficult and requires high astrometric precision .",
    "it is reasonably straightforward to measure accurate positions ( to fractions of an arcsec ) for sne on high - quality ground - based images .",
    "however , it is well known that positions based on the astrometric information in the _ hst _ image headers alone are not very accurate .",
    "online documentation for wfpc2 claims an accuracy of @xmath13 ; from experience , however , we have found it to be more typically @xmath14 _ or worse _ ( see , e.g. , filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ; van dyk et al .",
    "it is thus incumbent upon us to apply an _ independent _ astrometric grid to the wfpc2 images .",
    "for this reason we have adopted the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) as the basis for the astrometric grid for both the ground - based sn images and the _ hst _ images potentially containing the sn progenitor . while it is well known that the 2mass near - infrared catalogs are an unprecedented photometric resource",
    ", a less recognized fact is that the point source catalog is also of outstanding astrometric quality , with residuals in the final catalog typically and conservatively @xmath15 ( h. mccallon & r. cutri 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "the @xmath16-band 2mass images correspond quite well with the optical sn and _ hst _ images , such that a sufficient number of astrometric fiducial stars on the optical images can be employed to achieve accuracies in the astrometric solutions of typically @xmath17@xmath18 . for wfpc2",
    "this means , with a plate scale of @xmath19 pixel@xmath20 , that we can estimate the position of the progenitor star on a wf chip with uncertainty in the range of only three to nine pixels ( roughly double this pixel range for the pc chip ) .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we have measured all of the sn positions from @xmath21-band or unfiltered images obtained by the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; filippenko et al .",
    "2001 ; kait is the principal instrument for loss / lotoss ) , as part of kait sn light - curve monitoring ( see , e.g. , li et al .  2001 ; modjaz et al .",
    "2001b ; leonard et al .",
    "2002a , b ) .",
    "we then use the stsdas routine _ wmosaic _ within iraf to stitch together the four wfpc2 chips to obtain the full wfpc2 field of view .",
    "( this step is generally necessary for there to be enough available fiducial stars to facilitate the astrometry . )",
    "the _ wmosaic _ routine makes corrections for geometric distortion in each chip and for the rotation , offsets , and scale differences among the chips .",
    "application of 2mass to the full mosaic results in an astrometric reference frame , or grid , of satisfactorily high accuracy , verified by the resulting positions of at least one or more `` check stars '' on the mosaic .",
    "( the key , again , is that we are not employing the _ hst _ image header information , but imposing our own astrometric grid on the mosaic . )",
    "often we could match unsaturated stars on the wfpc2 mosaic with 2mass sources and directly derive an astrometric solution for the mosaic .",
    "when this was not possible , owing to a lack of 2mass sources seen on the wfpc2 mosaic , we matched 2mass sources first with relatively bright ( but unsaturated ) stars on deep optical images ( typically @xmath22 band ) of the sn host galaxies ( obtained in 2002 february and april at the palomar 1.5-m telescope ) and then , once an astrometric solution had been obtained , matched fainter stars seen in both the deep ground - based images and the wfpc2 mosaic , obtaining a new astrometric solution based on these objects .",
    "all astrometric solutions were derived throughout using the iraf task _ ccmap _ and applied using _",
    "cctran_. finally , we then determined the individual wfpc2 chip pixel value and the uncertainty in that value for the sn site and , therefore , for the progenitor .",
    "once the site was located , photometry of the appropriate wfpc2 chip was performed using the routine hstphot ( dolphin 2000a , b ) , which automatically accounts for wfpc2 point - spread function ( psf ) variations and charge - transfer effects across the chips , zeropoints , aperture corrections , etc . , and can return magnitudes in standard johnson - cousins bands as output , whenever possible .",
    "hstphot was run in all cases with a 3@xmath23 detection threshold .",
    "dolphin ( 2000a ) tested hstphot against dophot on the same dataset and found no systematic differences in the results from the two packages . similarly , saha et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , in their measurement of the cepheid distance to ngc 3982 , find the hstphot results to be within the errors of the dophot results .",
    "extensive tests by d.  c.  leonard ( 2002 , private communication ) of daophot against hstphot also show very good agreement ( in particular , on images of ngc 3351 , he finds @xmath24 and @xmath25 mag ; see graham et al .",
    "consequently , we can determine the magnitude and , when available , the color of the candidate progenitor , although , as we will see , for most objects this turns out to be placing only a _",
    "limit _ on the magnitude and color .    in three cases we were able to recover the sn in a late - time image , allowing us to isolate the exact position of the progenitor .",
    "these detections serve as a valuable test of our method : if the astrometric grid is truly accurate , we should be able to locate the old sn in a straightforward manner , which , in fact , proves to be the case .",
    "we emphasize that , short of having an accurate absolute position for these sne , the generally faint sources would be relatively difficult to unambiguously locate on a wfpc2 chip , especially with the possible presence of other variable stars in the host galaxy .",
    "the coincidence of the estimated sn position on the chip with the actual recovery position provides us with some confidence in the progenitor positions for the other cases , where no late - time image of the sn is available .",
    "all quoted positions are j2000 throughout .",
    "all observing dates are in ut , and the relevant _ hst _ go or gto program is given in each case . unless otherwise specified , the distance to the host galaxy is derived from the heliocentric radial velocity corrected for local group infall into the virgo cluster given in the lyon - meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) , and is based on an assumed distance scale of 65 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 . for lack of other data , the extinction correction toward the sn",
    "is limited in most cases to the galactic component [ generally adopting @xmath26 from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , and originally from schlegel , finkbinder , & davis ( 1998 ) ] , assuming the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) reddening law .",

    "the host galaxy was imaged in f606w ( 160 s ) by go-5446 on 1995 january 5 .",
    "the galactic foreground stars around the host on the wfpc2 mosaic are quite faint , and so we used a deep palomar @xmath22-band image to establish the astrometric grid for the mosaic .",
    "the uncertainty in the positions for these stars in the palomar image is @xmath34 .",
    "however , applying the grid to the mosaic resulted in an uncertainty of @xmath35 , likely due to the relative faintness of the stars in the mosaic . together with the measured uncertainty in the sn position ,",

    "it is therefore possible that we can detect the sn at late times and pinpoint the exact progenitor location .",
    "we applied the same grid as on the f606w mosaic to the f450w and f814w mosaics , using four of the same five faint fiducial stars .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the sn site on the pc chip and also shows that the astrometry produces quite similar results as in figure 2 for the sn location .",

    "( the low s / n of the fr680n images near the sn site does not make them particularly useful . ) the kait image was sufficiently deep that we could identify some of the stars in each of the f547 m mosaics , with astrometric uncertainty @xmath34 , for a total uncertainty of @xmath33 in the sn s position on the mosaics . in figure 23",
    "we show the sn site on the deep f547 m wf3 chip .",
    "two stars , a and b , are detected within at @xmath194 and @xmath195 mag . assuming a distance of about 64 mpc and galactic @xmath196 mag",
    ", we find @xmath197 and @xmath198 mag for the two stars , respectively , either of which could be the progenitor .",
    "if neither of these stars is the progenitor , then for a detection limit of @xmath199 mag , the progenitor had @xmath200 mag .",
    "in table 2 we summarize the results of our search for the progenitors of core - collapse sne . for sne with candidate progenitor identifications , we have also included , in parentheses , the limits on the absolute magnitude and color of a possible progenitor , if the candidate we have identified is not the actual progenitor .",
    "it should be noted that for all the magnitude and color estimates , we have assumed possibly inaccurate distance estimates and , in most cases , only the galactic component to the extinction toward the sn .",
    "consequently , we may have either underestimated or overestimated the absolute magnitude , or limits on the absolute magnitude , of candidate progenitors .",
    "extinction local to the sne within the host galaxies themselves will only lead to higher absolute brightnesses , and to bluer intrinsic colors , or color limits , for all these objects . at the least , we provide the measured magnitudes and magnitude limits for the sn progenitors , based on the hstphot output , so that , with additional information , the reader can make his or her own estimations .",
    "below , we briefly interpret our results , but we eschew transforming the observed magnitudes and colors into intrinsic properties , such as bolometric luminosity and surface temperature , for lack of adequate information about the stars .",
    "the candidate sne ii progenitors of sne 1999br , 1999ev , and 2001du all have absolute magnitudes ( @xmath201 to @xmath202 ) that are consistent with the known red supergiants in the galaxy .",
    "all of the magnitude limits for the other sne  ii are also consistent with supergiant stars .",
    "the only candidate with intrinsic color information , the progenitor candidate for sn 2001du , has a @xmath203 value more consistent with an early k spectral type ( e.g. , the vilnius spectral colors in bessell 1990 ) , rather than the m - type supergiant that we would expect , based on theoretical models . in fact , even if this candidate is not the progenitor , the @xmath203 color limit for the sn 2001du progenitor , as well as the color limits for the sn 1999bx progenitor [ if we discount the @xmath204 limit ] , imply spectral types that can only be as late as early m - type .",
    "the slightly bluer color might imply a somewhat more compact morphology for the progenitor envelope , or possible contamination of its light by a close , fainter and bluer companion star in a possible binary system",
    ".    models for sne  ib include the explosion of isolated wolf - rayet stars or of helium stars in binary systems , possibly with a wide orbit including a more massive main - sequence secondary ( e.g. , van den heuvel 1994 ) .",
    "both mechanisms could lead to sne  ib",
    ". however , branch et al .  (",
    "2002 ) find , from their analysis of sn  ib spectral data , that the masses and kinetic energies among sne  ib are similar , implying that progenitor masses must be similar as well .",
    "wolf - rayet stars that have been stripped of much of their helium could lead to sne  ic ; however , model light curves decline too slowly , compared to observations ( woosley , langer , & weaver 1993 ) .",
    "low - mass helium stars in binaries ( e.g. , nomoto et al .",
    "1990 ) end up with too much helium for sne  ic .",
    "nomoto et al .  ( 1994 ) explored a @xmath1223 @xmath205 c+o star ( which originally evolved from a 1318 @xmath205 main - sequence star ) in a close binary as the progenitor of the sn  ic 1994i in m51 .",
    "their model , possibly including a common - envelope phase , involves two episodes of mass transfer with a secondary , which eventually evolves to be a low - mass main sequence star , a neutron star , or a white dwarf .",
    "all of these scenarios involve compact stars , which are likely not particularly luminous ; barth et al .",
    "( 1996 ) place an upper limit of @xmath206 mag on the sn 1994i progenitor . as podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 1992 ) point out , mass transfer , in fact , could make the secondary more massive and more luminous when the primary explodes , meaning that a detected `` progenitor '' could actually be the companion star .",
    "the candidate progenitor for the sn ic 1999bu is quite luminous , with @xmath207 mag , which is consistent with the upper limit for the sn 1994i progenitor mentioned above .",
    "the candidate progenitors for the sne ib 2001b and 2001is are also very luminous , with @xmath1 to @xmath2 mag .",
    "the known wolf - rayet stars in the galaxy have absolute magnitudes spread over a large range , @xmath208 to @xmath209 mag ( van der hucht 2001 ) .",
    "the sn ib progenitor candidate luminosities are near or slightly above the upper end of this luminosity range .",
    "therefore , it is possible that these two sne ib arose from wolf - rayet stars .",
    "( however , with the uncertainties in the distances to and reddening within the host galaxies , these absolute magnitudes may actually fall outside the wolf - rayet luminosity range , i.e. , they would be too bright . ) the luminosities for these sn ib progenitor candidates are also consistent with those of other , less evolved , presumably blue or yellow supergiants ( humphreys & davidson 1979 ) .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that these candidates are not the progenitors , but instead multiple star systems or compact star clusters .    generally , the absolute magnitude limits for all other sne  ib / c ( the brightness limits for sne 2001ai and 2001ci are not very restrictive ) are consistent both with the range of wolf - rayet magnitudes and also with expectations for interacting binary models . the intrinsic color limits , although also usually not very restrictive , are consistent with blue or yellow stars .",
    "the most restrictive color limits are for the progenitors of sne 1999ec and 2001ci ( if , in this case , the extinction estimate @xmath1636 mag is , in fact , correct ) : taken together , these limits imply that the progenitors had spectral types of a - type or earlier ( bessell 1990 ) and are also consistent with the range of @xmath210 ( about @xmath211 to @xmath212 mag ) for galactic wolf - rayet stars ( van der hucht 2001 ) .",
    "the host galaxy of sn 2001ci , ngc 3079 , is seen nearly edge - on , so it is possible that the sn progenitor could have been a wolf - rayet star exploding while obscured by or embedded in dust .    to some extent ,",
    "our search was not fully satisfying .",
    "although it is true that , compared with the case of van dyk et al .",
    "( 1999b ) , the _ hst _ archive is currently much richer in pre - sn host galaxy images , which may potentially contain sn progenitors , and more importantly , post - sn images in which the fading sne may be recovered , the quality of these data is such that the s / n or number of filters used are generally still not ideal .",
    "the data in our sample are not yet sensitive enough for us to place more stringent constraints on the competing models for sne  ib / c .",
    "hst _ archive will steadily grow , however , as observations continue after the recent refurbishment mission .",
    "these new observations will also include images of galaxies with the superior advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "additionally , new nearby sne will be discovered by loss / lotoss and other sn searches , greatly expanding the potential sample .",
    "we intend to further exploit the _",
    "hst _ archive to continue to search for core - collapse sn progenitors ; the future looks bright for this subject .",
    "we have searched for the progenitor stars of 16 core - collapse sne using archival _ hst _ wfpc2 images .",
    "the sample includes 6 sne  ii and 10 sne  ib / c .",
    "we may have identified the progenitors of the sne ii 1999br , 1999ev , and 2001du as supergiant stars with @xmath213 mag in all three cases .",
    "we may also have identified the progenitors of the sne ib 2001b and 2001is as very luminous supergiants with @xmath1 to @xmath2 mag , and possibly the progenitor of the sn ic 1999bu as a supergiant with @xmath3 mag .",
    "if these identifications can be verified , this more than doubles the number of known sn progenitors from five to eleven . for all other sne in our sample",
    "we could only place limits on the progenitor absolute magnitude and color ( when multi - band images were available ) .",
    "we have also recovered sne 1999dn , 2000c , and 2000ew at late times .",
    "unfortunately , the pre - sn images for these recovered sne did not show a progenitor candidate at the sn position .",
    "the possible detections and constraints on the sn ii progenitors are broadly consistent with red supergiants as progenitor stars , although the progenitor candidates are not as red as would be expected , with their colors implying spectral types typically earlier than m. the sn  ib progenitor candidates may well be wolf - rayet stars , although possibly at the upper luminosity end for known stars of this kind .",
    "the lone sn ic progenitor candidate is consistent with a luminous supergiant star . in general",
    ", we can not place rigorous constraints on either the wolf - rayet star or massive interacting binary models for sn  ib / c progenitors , based on these data .",
    "for both the sne  ii and ib / c uncertainties in the host galaxy distances and extinction toward the sne also limit what conclusions we can draw about the progenitor stars .",
    "however , from purely environmental considerations , our results are consistent with those of van dyk et al .",
    "( 1999b ) , who found that sne  ib / c seem to be more closely associated with massive stellar regions than is true for sne  ii ; five of the sne  ib / c in our sample ( sne 1999ec , 2000c , 2000ew , 2001ai , and 2001is ) occurred very near bright , possibly blue and young star clusters ( the cluster near sn 2000c , based on the f300w image , is quite blue , and the cluster near sn 2000ew , based on the color - magnitude diagram , is quite young ) .",
    "again , the statistics are still small , but this continues to suggest that at least some sn  ib / c progenitors may be more massive , in general , than sn  ii progenitors , consistent with the wolf - rayet model",
    ".    a current program ( go-9353 ) is imaging six of the sne in our sample ( 1999an , 1999br , 1999ev , 2000ds , 2000ew , and 2001b ) in multiple bands with acs , to attempt to recover them at late times , with the same aim of matching the pre - sn and post - sn images to identify the sn progenitor .",
    "similarly , program go-9041 has imaged sn 2001du with wfpc2 , but the data are not yet public .",
    "for sne 1999an , 2000ds , and 2000ew , we have already likely recovered sn 2000ew , and we have already shown here that the pre - sn images are simply not of sufficient s / n to detect each sn progenitor . for sne 1999br , 1999ev , 2001b , and 2001du , the new observations from these programs will be quite revealing : if the sne are actually recovered , they may or may not match up positionally with the progenitor candidates that we have identified .    in this paper we have made some progress toward a statistically significant sample of core - collapse sn progenitors directly identified on _ hst _ image data . however , the limitations of the data continue to be the restricted field of view , low s / n , and poor color coverage . with the full operation of the newly commissioned acs onboard _ hst _ , and with additional galaxies observed using wfpc2 as well , the amount of available archive data will continue to grow , providing for larger sn samples in the future .",
