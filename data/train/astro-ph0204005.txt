    "in the ultraviolet band there are many resonance lines arising from the @xmath6 transitions including civ@xmath7 , nv@xmath8 , mgii@xmath9 , and ly@xmath10 .",
    "these lines are found to be prominent and conspicuous in many line - emitting objects including quasars , starburst galaxies , and planetary nebulae because they are major coolants in plasmas with temperature @xmath11 .",
    "the atomic physics associated with the @xmath6 transitions provides a nice and simple example of the quantum interferences between the excited levels .",
    "it is well - known that the resonance scattering between two levels with @xmath12 yields isotropic outgoing radiation that is completely unpolarised .",
    "this is in high contrast with the fact that a @xmath13 resonance scattering of an unpolarised photon associated with a @xmath14 transition yields the maximum degree of polarisation @xmath15 ( e.g. stenflo 1980 ; lee , blandford & western 1994 ) .",
    "stenflo ( 1976a , 1976b , 1980 , 1994 , 1996 ) and lee & blandford ( 1994 ) studied the polarisation of resonance lines .",
    "interesting phenomena occur when the incident radiation is scattered in off - resonance regimes , where both the polarisation and the angular distribution of the outgoing radiation are sensitively dependent on the wavelength of the incident radiation , as is illustrated by stenflo ( 1980 ) .",
    "one general result is that scattering in far off - resonance is characterised by the classical rayleigh scattering phase function .",
    "being the most prominent emission features with a very small fine - structure level - splitting in the excited states of hydrogen , ly@xmath0 should be treated with more emphasis and care . due to the small fine - structure level - splitting of hydrogen ,",
    "wing scatterings of ly@xmath0 are characterised by the classical rayleigh scattering phase function , which is the same phase function associated with the thomson scattering . hence ,",
    "when wing scatterings of ly@xmath0 become important in a thick medium of hydrogen , we naturally expect that the ly@xmath0 line transfer may be described in a way similar to the transfer of continuum photons in a thomson scattering medium .",
    "chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) investigated the polarisation of photons transferred in a very thick electron gas , where he showed the degree of polarisation reaches 11.7% for photons emergent in the grazing direction of very thick and plane - parallel media .",
    "phillips & mszros ( 1986 ) also investigated in a numerical way the radiative transfer in electron clouds , for both optically thin and thick cases .",
    "they found that the photons are beamed to the direction normal to the slab , and obtained 11.7% of polarisation confirming the work of chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) .",
    "the vertical column density @xmath16 of normal galaxies and dwarf galaxies ranges @xmath17 .",
    "the line - centre optical depth is related with the hi column density @xmath16 by @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the temperature of the medium in units of @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that the ly@xmath0 line - centre optical depth @xmath21 for most galaxies , and therefore one needs to deal with an extremely thick medium .",
    "it appears that many galaxies found in the early universe exhibit asymmetric ly@xmath0 emission , which is supposed to be emergent from media with these high optical depths .",
    "therefore , if the scattering medium possesses any geometrical or kinematical anisotropy , we may expect that the ly@xmath0 emission from these objects will be polarised .",
    "a preliminary investigation of the polarisation of ly@xmath0 emission in a thick medium has been presented in lee & ahn ( 1998 ) .",
    "they considered an anisotropically expanding and optically thick neutral medium with a hubble - type flow , and found that the emergent ly@xmath0 photons are linearly polarised with a degree of polarisation up to 10% in the direction parallel to the slab normal .",
    "they also applied their calculation to a hemispherical shell partly obscured by an opaque component such as a disc , and showed that about 5% of polarisation may develop .    in this paper , we calculate the polarisation of ly@xmath0 in more detail with the particular attention on the polarisation direction as a function of the optical depth .",
    "section 2 describes the configuration of our model and the monte carlo code . in section 3",
    ", we show the results , and explain microscopic processes of scatterings that lead to the development of ly@xmath0 polarisation , which is followed by the summary section .",
    "in a very thick medium , wing scattering plays a very important role in the transfer of resonance line photons , which is similar to a diffusion process .",
    "previous researchers ( avery & house 1968 ; adams 1972 ; harrington 1973 ; neufeld 1990 ) introduced the diffusion approximation where only wing scatterings take place during the transfer .",
    "this approximation is very efficient for the extremely thick cases with @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the voigt parameter defined as @xmath22 , the ratio of the natural width @xmath23 and the doppler frequency width @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the thermal speed and the line centre frequency , respectively .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath27 that measures the frequency shift from the line centre in units of @xmath28 , @xmath29    however , ly@xmath0 photons experience both core scatterings and wing scatterings and may alternate between these two types of scattering during the line transfer .",
    "a large number of core scatterings change the polarisation vector in a random way yielding an isotropic and unpolarised radiation field .",
    "therefore , we have to consider not only wing scatterings but also core scatterings in order to compute accurately the polarisation of ly@xmath0 emergent from a very thick h  i medium .",
    "ahn , lee , & lee ( 2000 , 2001 , 2002 ) developed a monte carlo code which can deal with the ly@xmath0 line transfer in thick media .",
    "they first dealt with moderate optical depths , because the diffusion approximation is not valid in this optical depth regime .",
    "they developed an accelerating scheme for the code in order to improve the computing speed , which enabled one to calculate the line transfer in extremely thick media .",
    "the code also accurately treats the partial frequency redistribution and is equipped with a subroutine that differentiates between resonant core scatterings and non - resonant wing scatterings , providing different scattering phase functions according to the type of scatterings .    in this work",
    ", we use the same monte carlo code , of which the description can be found in our previous work .",
    "our code treats the scattering of ly@xmath0 photons in a manner very faithful to the atomic physics associated with the fine - structure of hydrogen .",
    "the level - splitting of @xmath30 , the excited state of ly@xmath0 transition , is @xmath31 , which amounts to the doppler width of @xmath32 relative to ly@xmath0 .",
    "because this is much smaller than the thermal speed of a medium with @xmath33 , one normally neglects the @xmath30 level - splitting , treating it as a single level . even when @xmath34 , the level - splitting effects may be neglected in the cases where the line centre optical depth of the scattering medium is very large .",
    "this is because the escape of line photons can only be made in considerably far wings where the level - splitting is negligible .",
    "since we are particularly interested in the development of polarisation of ly@xmath0 , we provide the detailed description of the code about the angular redistribution and the polarisation of the scattered radiation .",
    "we adopt the density matrix formalism to describe the angular distribution and polarisation of the scattered ly@xmath0 , where the density operator is represented by a @xmath35 hermitian matrix @xmath36 . the usual relation with the conventional stokes parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "is given by @xmath39    fig .",
    "1 shows the model configuration adopted in this paper .",
    "we consider a static , uniform , and optically thick hi slab with the total optical thickness @xmath40 along the @xmath41axis that is chosen to be the slab normal .",
    "the completely unpolarised ly@xmath0 source is located at the origin of the coordinate system and @xmath42 is defined as the cosine of the angle between the wavevector of the emergent photon and the slab normal .",
    "we will not consider the circular polarisation because of the azymuthal symmetry assumed in this work .",
    "therefore @xmath43 and @xmath36 may be regarded as a real matrix .    in our monte carlo code",
    ", we only consider three types of scattering of ly@xmath0 , which are resonance scattering with @xmath44 , resonance scattering with @xmath45 and wing scattering far from both resonance transitions . at each scattering event , we compute the probability which type of scattering has occurred .",
    "the procedure for the computation of this probability is described in detail in our previous work ( ahn et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the incident radiation is described by the density matrix @xmath36 and the wavevector @xmath46 , and the scattered radiation is described by the corresponding primed quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48 we choose the polarisation vectors @xmath49 for an incident photon and correspondingly @xmath50 for the scattered photon .    with this choice of the polarisation basis and the scattering geometry shown in fig .  1",
    ", the polarisation will develop either in the direction parallel to the slab normal ( the @xmath51 component ) or in the direction perpendicular to the slab normal ( the @xmath52component ) .",
    "therefore , we may expect that the polarisation of the emergent radiation will be described completely by @xmath53 , the difference of the diagonal elements of the density matrix , which we will call the degree of polarisation . hence in this convention ,",
    "the positive degree of polarisation means polarisation in the direction perpendicular to the slab normal , and the negative polarisation is polarisation in the direction parallel to the slab normal . in this work",
    ", we refer the polarisation direction with respect to the slab normal vector which is the symmetry axis of the scattering medium .",
    "when a wing scattering occurs , the density matrix associated with the scattered radiation is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "when a given scattering is a resonance scattering associated with the transition @xmath45 , then the density matrix is obtained by the following relation @xmath56 \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\rho_{12}6\\cos\\theta\\sin2\\delta\\phi \\nonumber \\\\ \\rho_{12 } ' & = & 3\\rho_{11}\\sin2\\delta\\phi\\cos\\theta ' \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 6\\rho_{12}(\\cos\\theta\\cos\\theta'\\cos2\\delta\\phi \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sin\\theta\\sin\\theta'\\cos\\delta\\phi ) \\\\ & & + 3\\rho_{22}\\cos\\theta(-2\\sin\\theta\\sin\\theta'\\sin\\delta\\phi \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\cos\\theta\\cos\\theta'\\sin2\\delta\\phi ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\rho_{22 } ' & = & \\rho_{11}[(5 - 3\\cos2\\delta\\phi)\\cos^2\\theta'+2\\sin^2\\theta ' ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\rho_{22}[(5 + 3\\cos2\\delta\\phi)\\cos^2\\theta\\cos^2\\theta ' \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 2\\cos^2\\theta\\sin^2\\theta ' + 12\\cos\\delta\\phi\\cos\\theta\\cos\\theta'\\sin\\theta\\sin\\theta ' \\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2\\cos^2\\theta'\\sin^2\\theta+8\\sin^2\\theta\\sin^2\\theta ' ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\rho_{12}(6\\sin2\\delta\\phi\\cos^2\\theta'\\cos\\theta \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 2\\sin\\delta\\phi\\cos\\theta'\\sin\\theta\\sin\\theta ' ) \\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , when the scattering is resonant with the transition @xmath44 , then the density matrix for the scattered radiation is set to be @xmath57 which corresponds to the istropic and perfectly unpolarised radiation .    the angular distribution of the scattered radiation for an incident photon with @xmath58 and @xmath36 is given by the trace of @xmath59 , as is shown by lee et al .",
    "therefore , once the wavevector @xmath60 of a scattered photon is chosen from @xmath47 in accordance with the scattering type , the polarisation is also determined at the same time .",
    "it is also noted that the degree of polarisation is computed only after the new density matrix is normalised so that it has a unit trace .",
    "source at the origin denoted in the figure by @xmath61 .",
    "the vertical thickness of the slab is @xmath40 , and we define @xmath42 as the cosine of the angle between the wave vector of the emergent photon and the slab normal.,width=340 ]",
    "we calculate the degree of linear polarisation of ly@xmath0 photons emerging from an optically thick slab with unpolarised sources distributed in its central plane . in fig .  2",
    ", we show the linear degree of polarisation for various optical depths according to @xmath42 that represents the observer s line of sight with respect to the slab normal . in the calculations , we consider the cases where optical depths to the normal direction of the slab are @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . since we fixed @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , respectively . in the figure , the dots with @xmath68 error bars represent our results and the solid lines represent the result for continuum photons transferred in a thomson scattering semi - infinite electron cloud ( chandrasekhar 1960 ) .",
    "we can see in the figure that the case with @xmath69 shows good agreement with the limiting case of the thomson scattering .",
    "we also see that the polarisation curves gradually converge to that of the thomson scattering with a very large optical thickness as @xmath70 increases .    when @xmath5 , the ly@xmath0 transfer processes are dominated by wing scatterings accompanied by the spatial transfer and ly@xmath0 photons experience a number of successive wing scatterings just before escape ( ahn et al .",
    "the number of last successive wing scatterings is determined by the scattering optical depth , @xmath71 at the characteristic frequency of the emergent photons , given approximately by @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "they also showed that these are valid only for @xmath74 , when the diffusion approximation can be safely applied .",
    "for the cases considered in this section , the characteristic wing optical depths are @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "according to phillips & mszros ( 1986 ) , the limiting behaviour is almost achieved when @xmath76 .",

    "we show our results of the accelerated monte carlo calculations for the polarisation of ly@xmath0 emerging from an extremely thick hydrogen slab .",
    "the total number of photons in each simulation is @xmath88 , and the frequency bin is set to be @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath90 we set @xmath91 as an exception .",

    ", we show the emergent fluxes , in the middle panel the degree of polarisation @xmath92 , and in the bottom panel the characteristic optical depth , @xmath71 . treating the radiative transfer in a thomson scattering medium as a random walk process",
    ", we convert @xmath82 , the average number of successive wing scatterings just before escape , to the characteristic optical depth @xmath93 .",
    "it is immediately seen that negligible polarisation develops near the line - centre .",
    "this is because line photons with frequencies near the line - centre escape through a single longest flight after a large number of core scatterings near the surface , where the local core scatterings isotropise the radiation field .",
    "the core - wing boundary frequency is approximately given by eq.(8 ) with @xmath94 , or @xmath95 .",
    "hence our results in the figure show that @xmath96 at @xmath97 .",
    "the second point is that the photons filling the near wing part of ly@xmath0 emission are positively polarised , which means the electric vectors of those escaping photons tend to lie in the direction perpendicular to the slab normal .",
    "the degree of polarisation in this part is about @xmath98 , which is smaller than the maximum value @xmath99 , because they are averaged over emergent angles .",
    "it is very notable that the degree of polarisation becomes negative at far wing frequencies , which means that the polarisation direction flips from perpendicular to parallel as the frequency shift @xmath100 from the line - centre increases .    in order for wing photons to acquire scattering numbers larger than @xmath101 , they spatially diffuse much farther than @xmath3 in the stage of their final series of wing scatterings . according to ahn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , a line photon smears out towards the slab surface via wing scatterings , and therefore the photon diffuses into the grazing direction of the slab acquiring a sufficiently large frequency shift .",
    "this means that the scattering medium is effectively very thin in the normal direction from the view point of far wing scattering ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "therefore , the scattering plane associated with the escaping photons nearly coincides with the slab plane , leading to the development of polarisation in the direction parallel to the slab normal .",
    "this explains the negative polarisation in the far wing part illustrated in figs .",
    "3 - 7 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the near wing part of the emergent profiles is contributed by photons with much larger wing scattering numbers .",
    "therefore , a large number of wing scatterings acompanied by spatial transfer preferentially in the normal direction may cause the electric vectors of the line photons to become perpendicular to the slab normal . from this transfer process",
    ", we obtain positively polarised fluxes in accordance with our definition of polarisation direction .",
    "another point we can find in the figure is that the strength of the negative polarisation in the far wing regime decreases as @xmath70 increases .",
    "this effect can be understood in terms of the beaming effect .",
    "ahn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) investigated the beaming of ly@xmath0 photons for the cases of very large @xmath70 , which will also be shown in the next subsection .",
    "they showed that most photons escape from the extremely thick slab - like media favourably in the direction normal to the slab plane , as is the case with an electron scattering thick cloud ( phillips & mszros 1986 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the fraction of ly@xmath0 photons emergent in the direction parallel to the slab surface decrease as @xmath70 increases . as a result , their contribution to negative polarisation diminishes , and eventually the degree of polarisation at the far wings becomes larger and eventually positive .",
    "due to the beaming effect , the polarisation flip occurs farther away from the line - centre as @xmath70 increases .",
    "the polarisation of ly@xmath0 in an anisotropically expanding slab was investigated by lee & ahn ( 1998 ) .",
    "they calculated the cases with the line - centre optical depth @xmath102 and the voigt parameter @xmath103 .",
    "their results show that the polarisation flip occurs near the line - centre , and as a result the emergent peaks are negatively polarised on average over frequencies .",
    "because the bulk motion of the expanding slab enhances the photon escape , the polarization flip occurs at smaller optical depths than in the static medium with the same neutral hydrogen column density .",

    "9 shows the degree of polarisation as a function of @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath70 can be thought to be a measure of relative importance between wing scatterings and core scatterings in the line transfer .",
    "the error in @xmath110 is simply propagated from @xmath112 . the most important thing to note in fig .",
    "9 is that the polarisation sign changes as @xmath70 . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the polarisation direction is parallel to the slab normal , while for @xmath114 it is perpendiculat to it .",
    "as we saw in the previous subsection 3.1 , the case with @xmath115 and @xmath65 has the characteristic optical depth @xmath116 .",
    "we can understand the properties of ly@xmath0 wing scatterings by comparing with the thomson scattering in an optically thick electron cloud with @xmath117 , because the scattering is described by the same rayleigh phase function and spatial diffusion dominates the transfer process .    a close examination of the curves in fig .  2 and fig .  5 in phillips & mszros ( 1986 ) and those in fig .  2 and fig .",

    "the beaming of emergent ly@xmath0 is enhanced as @xmath70 increases . as a result",
    "the critical frequency of the polarisation flip moves toward the larger value , which we can see in fig .  3 - 7 .",
    "we have investigated the linear polarisation of ly@xmath0 transferred in a static , dustless , and thick slab that is uniformly filled with neutral hydrogen .",
    "the polarisation behavious of the emergent ly@xmath0 emission can be understood qualitatively by comparing with the polarisation behaviour of the thomson scattered radiation .",
    "when the scattering medium is extremely thick or @xmath69 , photons emerging in the grazing direction are polarised perpendicular to the slab normal with the degree up to @xmath1 , which is the same value as that of the thomson scattered radiation in a semi - infinite thick medium ( chandrasekhar 1960 ) .",
    "the variation of linear polarisation with @xmath70 also shows similar behaviour with that of the thomson scattering ( phillips & mszros 1986 ) .",
    "the linear polarisation of ly@xmath0 develops in the direction parallel to the slab normal when @xmath4 , while it becomes perpendicular when @xmath5 .",
    "our simulated spectropolarimetry of ly@xmath0 shows the polarisation flip in the spectra .",
    "the linear polarisation near the line centre is almost zero .",
    "the wing parts near the line centre are polarised in the direction perpendicular to the slab normal , while the far wing parts are polarised in the direction parallel to the slab normal .",
    "the zero polarisation around the resonance frequency is caused by resonance scatterings just before escape which isotropises the electric vector of the ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "the perpendicular polarisation at the far wing parts is caused by ly@xmath0 photons preferentially emerging in the grazing direction .",
    "the ly@xmath0 photons constituting the near wing part of the emergent peaks have large wing optical depths , and therefore they are beamed in the slab normal direction , which gives rise to positive polarisation . as @xmath70 increases , the beaming effect prevents ly@xmath0 photons with far wing frequencies from emerging into the grazing direction .",
    "therefore , the location of the polarisation flip in the ly@xmath0 line can be an important indicator of the value of @xmath70 .",

    "<S> our simulated spectropolarimetry of ly@xmath0 from a highly thick medium is characterised by negligible polarisation around the line centre , parallel polarisation in the near wing parts and perpendicular polarisation in the far wing parts , where the polarisation direction is measured with respect to the slab normal . </S>",
    "<S> the polarisation flip naturally reflects the diffusive nature of the ly@xmath0 transfer process in both real space and frequency space . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the beaming effect that is associated with the parallel polarisation in the near wing parts of the emission .    </S>",
