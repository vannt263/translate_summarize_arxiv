    "soon thereafter , sets of _ universal _ one- and two - qubit gates were found @xcite which allow for decomposing any unitary representation of a quantum computational gate into elementary universal ones .",
    "exploring computational complexity as well as devising timeoptimal realisations of given quantum algorithms by admissible controls has therefore become an issue of considerable practical interest , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in particular the number of computational steps required to implement a quantum gate or to simulate its hamiltonian is a measure of the actual cost to put the gate or the simulation into practice .",
    "a specific question is , whether the sign - inverted hamiltonian @xmath14 can be simulated with only @xmath15 and a set of given control hamiltonians being at hand .",

    "this is of practical relevance , because when simulating quantum systems one often faces two - part generic tasks : ( i ) let certain interactions evolve while ( ii ) other effective multi - qubit interactions shall be suppressed .",
    "the latter may be achieved by decoupling , but often it suffices that unwanted interactions cancel at a certain time , _",
    "e.g. _ right at the end of an experiment , which is to say they are to be refocussed by inverting them at suitable points in time .",
    "this is important for instance to avoid undesired or dissipative coupling of a quantum system to its environment or bath @xcite .",
    "many techniques have been developed in magnetic resonance @xcite on the basis of average - hamiltonian theory @xcite . moreover , local inversions arise in the context of locc , i.e. local operations and classical communication @xcite .",

    "while @xmath20 represents _ time reversal_. following wigner  @xcite in these very general terms , one immediately finds @xmath21 now imagine time translation is accompanied by the hamiltonian unitary evolution of some quantum interaction @xmath16 according to @xmath22 for all @xmath19 .",

    "this paves the way to discuss pair interaction hamiltonians . connecting several pairs then leads to assess local invertibilty in terms of coupling graphs in the case of multi - qubit systems .",
    "the transformation properties of multi - qubit interactions seen as spherical tensors of different quantum orders @xmath12 allow for treating the problem in its normal form , namely invertibility by joint or individual local @xmath38-rotations",
    ". moreover , the quantum order @xmath12 relates to the roots of the standard root - space decomposition , which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for local invertibility .",
    "after relating the findings to cartan - like decompositons induced by the concurrence cartan involution linked to time - reversal symmetry , we finally establish the relation to global minima of the least - squares distance over the restricted group of local unitaries . so invoking the norm property associated with the frobenius distance",
