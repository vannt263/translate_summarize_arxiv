    "our view of spicules has been revolutionized thanks to advanced instruments such as the hinode satellite @xcite and the swedish 1-meter solar telescope ( sst ) , where adaptive optics and image post - processing are necessary @xcite . using hinode observations , @xcite distinguished at least two different types of spicules .",
    "the first type of spicules ( so - called type  i ) reach heights above the photosphere of 2 - 9  mm , have a lifetime of 3 - 10 minutes and shows up- and downward motion @xcite .",
    "type  i spicules are probably the counterpart of the dynamic fibrils on the disk and they follow a parabolic path in space and time .",

    "although the formation of type  i spicules seems to be well understood , even the most recent studies do not include various processes that may play an important role in chromospheric dynamics and/or diagnostics such as time dependent ionization , generalized ohm s law , 3d radiative transfer with scattering , etc ) .",
    "the impact of these various effects on type  i spicule evolution should be tested and compared with observations .",
    "the second type of spicules ( so - called type  ii ) reaches greater heights ( @xmath0  mm ) and has shorter lifetimes ( @xmath1s ) than type  i spicules @xcite .",
    "in addition , type  ii spicules show apparent upward motions of order @xmath2  km  s@xmath3 and at the end of their life they usually suffer a rapid fading in images taken in chromospheric lines .",
    "the counterparts on the disk appear as rapidly moving absorbing features in the blue wing of chromospheric lines @xcite .",
    "in contrast to type  i spicules , type  ii spicules are not well understood .",
    "for example , some observations suggest the type  ii spicules are impulsively and continuously accelerated while being heated to at least transition region temperatures @xcite .",
    "recent observations @xcite add complexity by indicating that some type  ii spicules also show a decrease or a more complex velocity dependence with height . these spicules seem to show emission in transition region and coronal lines @xcite ; but @xcite using lower signal - to - noise observations suggest that this emission comes from cold plasma . in addition ,",
    "sdo / aia observations show that some type  ii spicules observed at the limb in the channel 304  ( ) but it is unclear how common this is .",
    "the lack of detailed observational constraints poses significant challenges to theoretical modeling . as a result",
    "there is currently no model that can describe all aspects of type  ii spicule formation .",
    "other motions , apart from the apparent upward motion , are observed in type  ii spicules .",
    "for instance , these features show swaying motions at the limb of order @xmath4  km  s@xmath3 , suggesting alfvnic waves as observed in the chromosphere by @xcite and @xcite , and in the transition region and corona by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that some spicules show multi - thread structure as result of a possible rotation .",
    "the torsional motions along spicules were suggested in earlier reports @xcite , but only recently unequivocally established using high resolution spectroscopy at the limb by @xcite .",
    "the latter establish that type  ii spicules show torsional motions of order @xmath5  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "similar torsional motions were observed in transition region lines in macrospicules and explosive events using both dopplergrams and line profiles @xcite .    as a result of the highly dynamic and finely structured nature of this type of spicules and the complex physical processes governing the chromosphere ( radiation , time - dependent ionization , partial ionization effects , etc . ) our understanding of type  ii spicules remains limited , as mentioned above .",
    "it is important that a successful model of these jets also explains the impact of type  ii spicules on the various atmospheric layers ( from the chromosphere to the lower corona ) . @xcite and @xcite suggested that type  ii spicules are driven by magnetic reconnection .",
    "another possible candidate , also more elaborated , was presented by @xcite where the chromospheric plasma is ejected as a result of being squeezed by the magnetic tension resulting from flux emergence . the resulting jet shows evidence of both high velocities in the chromosphere and heating of plasma to coronal temperatures . on this basis , the jet was tentatively identified as a type  ii spicule .",

    "@xcite described a physical process of a jet which in several aspects resembles a type  ii spicule as described in the current paper .",
    "while some of the properties of this jet resemble type  ii spicules , we only have a single example in our simulation .",
    "we discuss possible reasons below . in summary , this process follows naturally as a consequence of the constantly evolving magnetic and thermal environment of the modeled plasma .",
    "the spicule is composed of chromospheric material that is rapidly ejected from the chromosphere into the corona , while being heated .",
    "the source of the ejection of the chromospheric material is located in a region with large field gradients and intense currents leading to strong lorentz forces that squeeze the plasma .",
    "this increases the pressure gradient leading to strong upflows along the magnetic field lines .",
    "most of the heating comes from magnetic energy dissipation which appears as a result of the interaction between the ambient field and the emerging fields that straightened as they expanded into the atmosphere .",
    "the resulting interaction between the emerging and ambient field lines leads to a tangential discontinuity and subsequently strong heating .",

    "the intensities are normalized on the maximum intensity of the mean profile.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    @xcite described how chromospheric material is ejected into the corona , but what does the jet look like in synthetic chromospheric observations ? in this subsection",
    "we show how the jet that resembles a type  ii spicule appears in synthetic chromospheric diagnostics .",
    "let us begin with discussing the on - disk view and then proceed to the off - limb view .",
    "[ sec : chrom - on - disk ]    in observations on the disk , rbes appear as a clearly separate component of absorption in the blue wing of the  and  profiles ( for example , see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the solid red curves in figure  [ fig : cap ] show typical examples of rbe profiles , with a clearly lower - than - average intensity in the blue wing , with an unaffected red wing .",
    "in contrast , the synthetic profiles of the spicule do not show such blue - wing asymmetry .",
    "instead both the  and  profiles show an asymmetric line core , whose minimum intensity are blue - shifted @xmath35 and @xmath36  km  s@xmath3 respectively from the rest wavelength of the line .",
    "the shift is much smaller than the upflow velocities in the simulated spicule .",
    "figure  [ fig : cap ] is chosen at @xmath10s , i.e. , when the spicule reaches the longest insertion into the corona .",
    "figure  [ fig : breakca ] shows why the synthetic profiles do not show a blue - wing absorption coefficient .",
    "the top row shows line - center images , the location of the spicule does not stand out ( this is also the case in observations ) .",
    "the middle row shows blue - wing images . here",
    "the spicule location shows up as small patches of below - average intensity , but it does not stand out from the other dark structures in the image . the bottom row finally shows why the spicule does not leave an imprint in the profiles and images .",
    "the spicule is visible as the thin cold jet protruding into the hotter coronal material .",
    "however , the overplotted optical depth curves show that the spicule has a vertical optical thickness smaller than @xmath37 , too small to leave an imprint on the emergent profiles : the optical thickness at @xmath38  mm is actually only @xmath39 .",
    "this lack of opacity can be caused by too low mass density and/or too high temperature that lead to ionization to  and therefore too little opacity .",
    "we tested the effect of the temperature by assuming all calcium in the atmosphere is in the form of  and computing the upper bound of the optical thickness of the spicule given the mass density .",
    "the spicule then gets an optical thickness at @xmath38  mm of 0.02 which is also too small to leave an imprint on the emergent profile .",
    "having a lower temperature spicule ( or having a delayed ionization of  through non - equilibrium ionization ) would thus not be enough to get an observable signal ; the mass density is also too low by at least a factor of five .",
    "this is consistent with the low electron density in the simulated spicule ( @xmath40  @xmath41 above @xmath38  mm ) compared to electron densities derived from spicule observations ( @xmath42@xmath43  @xmath41 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of density may be caused by the fact that the spicule does not eject enough chromospheric material .",
    "it may also be that the spicule expands too fast in the corona due to the magnetic field expansion .",
    "the simulations have a rather simplified magnetic field configuration ( figure  [ fig : init ] ) compared to those on the sun , e.g. , the simulated emerging flux tube is a longitudinal flux tube along the @xmath7-axis . in contrast , in the sun the small - scale emergence occurs frequently , and the orientation of these events is random @xcite .",
    "the observed field strengths are also different from those in our simulation . in addition",
    ", the modeled ambient magnetic field does not show the same salt and pepper distribution as in the solar photosphere .",
    "the simulated magnetic field distribution is most likely also not reproducing the interaction between network and internetwork and the various scales observed in the sun .",
    "note that the magnetic complexity seems to play a role in eruptions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it might be expected that a more complicated modeled field could lead to more violent chromospheric and coronal dynamics .",
    "this may explain why these jets are rare in the simulations , i.e. , because we lack magnetic field complexity and the interaction between various magnetic features    the core of the synthetic profiles are narrower than the observed profiles ( figure  [ fig : cap ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy between synthetic and observed profiles exists not only in the spicule but in all current simulations .",

    ".     increase of projected velocity along the simulated spicule .",
    "the horizontal mean of the velocity projected at an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the vertical axis is shown as a function of height at @xmath10s where the spicule is located and the temperature is lower than @xmath44  k. this increase is similar to observations which show an increase of the doppler shift with distance along the rbes.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in contrast to the observations , where the spicules are usually not aligned with the los , the synthetic spicule is aligned with the vertical axis .",
    "first results done by @xcite revealed that most of the observed rbes show an acceleration along them .",
    "most recent and more detailed studies showed that observed rbes can show a doppler shift increase , decrease or a variable distribution with height @xcite . in our simulated spicule",
    ", we investigate how the spicule aligned flows depend on height by calculating the velocity along a los that is 30 degrees off the vertical axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : provel ] shows this projected velocity at @xmath10s for positions where the spicule is located and the temperature is lower than @xmath44  k. the projected velocity increases along the spicule , basically because the plasma is accelerated along the whole spicule and not at a single location .",
    "this acceleration is due to the fact that the compression acts along a large stretch along the spicule @xcite .",
    "this may explain the observed increase of doppler shift with height along rbes @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : caxz ] shows images of the simulated off - limb intensity at the center of  ( left ) ,  h  3968  ( middle ) as well as a @xmath45-slice of  h ( right ) .",
    "the intensity was computed by solving the transfer equation along the @xmath9-axis for each @xmath46 point in the simulation box .",
    "the effect of the curvature of the sun was not taken into account .",
    "the spicule reaches heights up to 4.9  mm for  h and 5.5  mm for  above the photosphere , i.e. , this is a small type  ii spicule but still within their observed height range @xcite .",
    "note that in the spicule the synthetic   emission extends to a larger heights ( @xmath47  mm ) than the  h emission . even though this is at the limb and for a different line",
    ", it seems compatible with recent observations where the location of  rbes are found closer to the footpoints than  rbes @xcite .",
    "the synthetic spicule also shows substructure suggestive of multiple threads consistent with some observations of off - limb spicules with hinode @xcite .",
    "this structure is caused by the density and temperature variation within the spicule .",
    "this variation is caused by two factors : 1 ) the energy release is not uniformly distributed across and along the spicule ; 2 ) the ejected plasma does not uniformly expand into the corona because the magnetic field lines do not uniformly expand with height .",
    "one of the major discrepancies between the off - limb observations and synthetic observables is the difference in scale height intensity for the line core emission of  h and . at @xmath48  mm above the limb of the quiet sun , @xcite find a scale height of @xmath49  mm in the  h line .",
    "in contrast , in the synthetic observables in the vicinity and inside of our spicule event , we find intensity scale heights of only @xmath50  mm for the  h line and @xmath51  mm for .",
    "further from the spicule , in regions where the atmosphere is not affected by flux emergence and the spicule event , the intensity scale heights are even smaller ; @xmath52  mm and @xmath50  mm for  h and  respectively ( the presence of flux emergence increases the intensity scale height as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as a result",
    ", the optical thickness at line center of the  spicule at @xmath53  mm is @xmath54 , i.e. , this signal may be too faint to detect in real observations .",
    "we speculate that there are several reasons for the difference in intensity scale height :    a.   as a result of the small size of the numerical domain the simulation lacks the los superposition of background intensity at spicular heights .",
    "b.   the simulation likely has a spatial resolution that is too low .",
    "c.   as mentioned in section  [ sec : chrom - on - disk ] , the spicule does not eject enough chromospheric material and/or expands too quickly into the corona .",
    "d.   as alluded , the simulation does not mimic emergence of small - scale flux on the sun , i.e. , the salt and pepper distribution and the small - scale flux emergence distribution in the simulation do not reproduce the observations well .",
    "e.   finally , current calculations do not take into account time - dependent ionization .",
    "the latter effect can in principle lead to larger formation heights for both  h and   @xcite .    at the limb",
    "the spicule shown in  h ( right panel of figure  [ fig : caxz ] ) rises @xmath55  mm in @xmath56s , i.e. , the apparent upward speed is around @xmath57  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this speed is significantly smaller than the observed apparent velocities in  h filtergrams at the limb @xcite .",
    "in the early state of the spicule , the leftmost streamline indicates that spicular material at the top of the spicule rises with the same speed as the apparent upward motion .",
    "spicular material that is accelerated upward at later times reaches larger velocities , up to 40 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the apparent upward motion of the off - limb emission is stopped as the gas in the spicule is heated to temperatures above 20  kk and all calcium is ionized to .",
    "therefore , the apparent acceleration in the second half of its evolution is limited by the ionization front .",

    "the dominant heating mechanism is the joule heating .",
    "however , the complexity of the spicule shows that other sources also can play a role in different parts of the spicule .",
    "for example , thermal conduction seems to be rather important in regions where the temperature of the plasma reaches @xmath58  k. these regions are located at the edge of the chromospheric material ; the upward flowing plasma that stays cool the longest and that penetrates into the corona is finally heated by conduction ( this parcel of plasma can be appreciated in the running time difference of   shown in figure  [ fig : intt ] around @xmath59  mm and @xmath60s ) .    inside the chromospheric material of the spicule",
    ", the radiative cooling ( panel e in figure  [ fig : joucond ] ) plays an important role counteracting the viscous and joule heating ( panel a and f ) .",
    "the radiative cooling is greater in the earlier states of the spicule .",
    "when the spicule expands into the corona , the density drops , and the joule heating also becomes more important : the chromospheric material heats up with time and radiative losses decrease .",
    "the largest contributions to the radiative cooling come from hydrogen and calcium ions .",
    "finally , one of the hot footpoints is heated mainly due to joule heating ( figure  [ fig : joucond ] ) .",
    "afterwards , conduction ( panel d ) and advection ( panel c ) spread this heat along field lines .",
    "as can be appreciated in the figure , the regions where the different heating sources are concentrated are not easily linked , and the 3d structures are rather complex .",
    "we would like to remark that , in contrast , type  i spicules do not have strong sources of joule heating , and the plasma suffers an expansion followed by a contraction @xcite .",
    "therefore , this type of spicules shows the well - known parabolic profile .",
    "however , the type  ii spicule candidate shows a complex contribution of various heating and cooling terms , emphasizing the role of joule heating .",
    "in addition , the chromospheric plasma does not experience an expansion followed by a compression , but it is ejected into the corona and heated .",
    "we are neglecting physical processes in the chromosphere that may impact the evolution of the spicule :    * the ion - neutral effects such as a proper treatment of generalized ohm s law play an important role that may change the way the spicule is heated ( see a discussion of the importance of these effects in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "* joule heating in the model is dependent on numerical dissipation in order to keep structures resolvable on the numerical grid , therefore they will occur on much larger scales than those found on the sun .",

    "ionization of hydrogen and helium is treated with the simplifying assumption of lte .",
    "proper inclusion of non - equilibrium ionization @xcite will lead to a different response of the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere to sudden heating .",
    "we study the impact of the simulated type  ii spicule on the corona using synthetic euv intensities and spectra under the optically thin approximation and ionization equilibrium conditions as described in section  [ sec : synthetic ] .      during the evolution of the spicule",

    "we consider only the dominant ions to isolate the information of the specific sdo / aia channels from the emission caused by other `` non - dominant '' lines @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that  line formation is poorly understood , so it is not clear that the coronal approximation approach is valid @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we calculated the line assuming coronal approximation and that the line is optically thin .",
    "it is interesting that the locations of the various emissions are not co - spatial due to the complex thermal process occurring inside and surroundings the spicule .",
    "for instance , the  emission at the limb shows clearly the structure of the spicule , i.e. , the shape of the ejected chromospheric material , but most of the emission coming from  is concentrated at the footpoint of the spicule , and for  it is also along field lines that connect to the footpoints of the spicule where most of the heating source is located .    in the disk view , the emission coming from   is not concentrated where the spicule is , but at the side boundaries of the ejected chromospheric material , rather similar to .",
    "this is basically because at the footpoints of the spicule the density is higher than at the top of the spicule , and both the  and  contribution functions peak near the transition region , i.e. , surrounding the spicule .",
    "the spicule is heated but the plasma inside the spicule is never `` filled in '' with the emission of these lines because the spicule is not heated uniformly .",
    "in contrast , the emission coming from  is located along the field lines that connect to the footpoint of the spicule . as a result , it is a significant challenge to link the emission coming from the different ions in space and time .",
    "note that some of the detailed spatial structuring of the spicules observed in the different lines vanishes when taking into account sdo / aia spatial resolution .    disentangling emission from various ions in the spicule",
    "is difficult because of the complexity of the simulated jet .",
    "an additional complication , arises from the fact that the various sdo / aia channels have contributions from other , typically non dominant lines ( * ? ? ?",

    "we find that the non - dominant lines do not play a significant role in the emission of the simulated spicule .",
    "we note that the most significant non - dominant lines in the 171 , 193 , and 211  sdo / aia channels are emitted by ions formed at very similar low transition region temperatures ( e.g. , /vi ) .",
    "this means that significant emission from such ions in spicules would occur at the same location and time for the various sdo / aia channels .",
    "we can exploit this to distinguish between emission coming from the dominant ion and the non - dominant ions . as we can see in section  [ sec : compobs ] our model agrees well with the observed offset space and time in the sdo / aia channels @xcite .",

    "in fact , the emission increases in time over more than 5 minutes .",
    "this increase starts earlier in cooler lines such as  and .",
    "in addition , a weak brightening on the disk for the various filters is formed in the spicule when it is ejected ( @xmath61s ) , but it is very faint and it can be appreciated only in the running difference .",
    "additionally , the increase is fainter for hotter lines ( compare with observations , section  [ sec : compobs ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting that on the disk  is concentrated in a small region , but for the coronal lines the emission is spread out over more than @xmath62  mm .",

    "the strongest signal is from , but is also noticeable in  and .",
    "nevertheless , the strongest contribution of these two lines comes roughly one hundred seconds later . in a similar fashion",
    "as seen on the disk , for , , and  the source of this strong emission comes from the footpoint of the spicule , which is heated by joule heating and propagated along the field lines by conduction into the upper layers in the corona .",
    "in contrast , the formation temperature of  is too low for the conduction .",
    "however , thermal conduction plays a role in the fading in the  emission around @xmath60s : as the last remaining chromospheric parcel penetrates into the corona , the plasma around @xmath68  k is heated beyond the  formation temperature ( see panel m around @xmath69  mm and @xmath60s in figure  [ fig : intt ] ) .",
    "we note the lifetime of the profiles in  is of the same order as in the observations ( a few hundred seconds ) .",
    "compare these results with the observations described in section  [ sec : compobs ] .",
    "it is important to mention that the length , `` propagation '' and duration of the emission of , , and  are strongly dependent on the magnetic field configuration .",
    "in fact , our domain is small and most of the magnetic field lines are confined within the small domain with only a few open field lines that cross the top boundary .",
    "plasma on the latter loses heat because the upper boundary is open . as a result of this",
    ", the open field lines do not maintain the high temperatures because the energy is transported through the top of the domain due to thermal conduction .",
    "in contrast , the closed field lines produce small hot loops that are heated by the joule heating coming from the footpoint of the spicule .",
    "this magnetic field configuration differs from that usually found on the sun ( section  [ sec : compobs ] ) .",
    "the field lines in the sun are probably more complex and , e.g. , in plage regions the magnetic field lines connect over very large distances , so that heat can propagate further and be distributed to greater distances . in a similar manner , the magnetic field configuration of our simulation is also completely different from the magnetic field in coronal holes .",
    "the field configuration of the simulation , despite the simplicity of the magnetic field configuration and the small size which forces it to have small loop structures in the corona , may nevertheless be `` similar '' to a quiet sun .        at the limb ,",
    "the emission in  shows a feature rising in a similar fashion as in  h , but it reaches greater heights ( almost 2  mm higher , see figure  [ fig : intt ] ) .",
    "however , the synthetic   disappears from the limb view in a different fashion than  h. the latter disappears in a few seconds because the plasma is heated out of the passband .",
    "the synthetic  at the limb does not vanish as fast as the synthetic  h.    the synthetic   shows that the upper part of the spicule penetrates into the corona and at the same time fades until it disappears . while the typical observed behavior is for  spicules to follow a parabolic profile with time @xcite , a few examples in figure  s5 in @xcite actually show similar behavior to our simulation : e.g. , at height @xmath70  mm and @xmath71s , @xmath72s , and @xmath73s .",
    "the reason for this evolution in our simulation is because the upper part of the spicule is gradually heated from above by joule heating and conduction ( see left panel of figure  [ fig : tguz ] and right panel of figure  [ fig : caxz ] ) .",
    "the observed parabolic height time profile of  type ii spicules has typically been interpreted as a consequence of plasma moving up and down , similar to the cooler dynamic fibrils and type  i spicules @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : twist ] shows in an early stage of the spicule ejection the vertical cut of the vorticity , the velocity perpendicular to the plane ( @xmath94 ) , and the two most important terms on the right side of the equation  [ eq : vort ] in the chromosphere and corona , i.e. , the magneto baroclinic term and the magnetic tension . as a result of the compression at the footpoint of the spicule due to the magnetic field tension , the magneto baroclinic term generates a vorticity not only inside the chromosphere but also all the way up into the corona .",
    "this vorticity is generated in the chromosphere at the footpoint of the spicule , and it is the result of the compression . the magnetic baroclinic term is important because the density decreases along the y - axis and this density gradient is perpendicular to the gradient of magnetic pressure that is perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "in addition , the gradient of magnetic pressure perpendicular to the field lines is large along the x - axis .",
    "this is a consequence of the plasma being compressed : resulting in the generation of vertical vorticity .",

    "here we use the same data set to see if we can recognize some similar features in the simulated spicule .",
    "figure  [ fig : aiaobs ] shows a time series of an rbe visible as a dark feature in  ( -868m ) ( top row ) . along the rbe the second and third rows of the figure show a brightening at transition region ( 304  channel ) and coronal ( 211  channel ) temperatures @xcite . note that the features are not overlapping exactly in space and time .",
    "this property agrees with the simulation . in the simulation ,",
    "the emission from different lines shows different structures and do not overlap because the heating is not uniformly located and the various temperature structures in the spicule and surroundings are complex . as mentioned before",
    ", the fact that the brightenings do not share the exact location and instant implies that the 304  channel most likely shows transition region temperatures ( ) and the 211  channel shows coronal temperatures ( ) .",
    "there are two major features that catch our attention in the time evolution of the brightening in the aia channels shown in figure  [ fig : aiaobs ] .",
    "one of these is hardly seen in the modeled spicule .",
    "this brightening is following the spicule in the sdo / aia channels and disappears almost as quickly as the spicule fades .",
    "this was observed by @xcite .",
    "this brightening is small in the simulation in comparison with the observations .",
    "this may be a consequence of the simulated spicule being not as violent as the observed spicules .",
    "the other feature seems to be more evident in the simulations than in the observations but still observed here in the various sdo / aia channels .",
    "this is the brightening at the footpoint of the rbe which lasts for a few hundred seconds , and seems to increase in time .",
    "this may indicate that the heating mechanism persists longer than the lifetime of the rbe .",
    "other examples of this type of observations are shown in figure  [ fig : maiaobs ] , which shows time - space plots where these two features in the time evolution can be seen in one or more of the sdo / aia channels .",
    "note that these data are pushed to the limit of their spatial and temporal resolution and signal to noise to enhance the brightening .",
    "we find that in the aia observations it is more common to see an increase of brightening in the 304  channel than in the coronal emission .",
    "in contrast , in the simulation we see the opposite .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by two issues .",
    "first , the modeled magnetic field configuration is different from that on the sun . in the simulation",
    "the magnetic field is confined to a small domain and the magnetic field lines that produce this strong coronal emission close within the computational domain .",
    "therefore , the heat and high temperatures are confined on these lines , so thermal conduction does not strongly dilute the heat input .",
    "this may lead to a modeled coronal emission that is brighter than on the sun .",
    "second , the formation of   is not well understood @xcite , which likely leads to discrepancies between our calculations and the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : asymobssum ] shows sumer observations of  1238   of a quiet sun and network region .",
    "the intensity of the line is slowly changing in the bright network region over the course of the one hour long timeseries .",
    "the eight rb panels show ( once again ) , in the magnetized network , redward asymmetry for velocities less than 50  km  s@xmath3 shifting rapidly to blueward asymmetries for velocities in excess of 50  km  s@xmath3 . in the internetwork regions",
    "very little asymmetry is found for these velocities .",
    "further analysis of the  1238  time series shows that the characteristic timescale on which these upflow events seem to recur is of order 3 - 15 minutes .",
    "this is illustrated on the right side of figure  [ fig : asymobssum ] which shows , as a function of time and space , the episodic nature of the rb asymmetry of the line ( summed from 58 to 111  km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by a wavelet analysis ( using the morlet wavelet ) of the rb timeseries : the resulting wavelet power spectrum ( bottom right panel ) shows significant ( at 95% significance level ) power throughout the timeseries at periods of order 3 - 5 minutes , as well as some at 15 min . from the models we can not make this type of study since we were not able to simulate the recurrence of these events .",
    "the middle panel shows the rb timeseries at @xmath99 with clear peaks of blueward asymmetry occurring , and typical events lasting of order 1 - 3 minutes .",
    "it is also interesting to see that the strong intensity lasts for more than 5 minutes for the event at @xmath99 , i.e. , a few minutes more than the rb asymmetry signal .",
    "this lifetime of the strong intensity signal seems to agree with the simulations and the sdo / aia results as mentioned above .",
    "figure  [ fig : asymobseis ] shows eis observations of several coronal lines of an active region . from this data set @xcite studied the recurrence of these signals .",
    "here we are interested in the duration of a particular event . around @xmath100min",
    "there is an event in the hotter lines that lasts for 5 minutes in intensity and doppler shift , and the rb asymmetry and line width starts later and seems to last shorter ( 3 - 4 min ) . similarly around @xmath101min for the cooler lines (  275 , /xii",
    "184 ) , the intensity doppler shift and rb asymmetries last for more than 3 minutes . note the large difference of the lifetime of these events in the coronal lines ( @xmath36min ) and the transition region lines ( @xmath102min ) .",
    "the lifetime of the rb asymmetries in the transition region lines as shown with sumer in figure  [ fig : asymobssum ] is shorter ( 1 - 3 minutes ) than the lifetime of the rb asymmetries and doppler shifts of the coronal lines ( figure  [ fig : asymobseis ] ) .",
    "this is very similar to what we see in the simulations . from the model ,",
    "the transition region lines show large rb asymmetries for a lifetime of roughly 2 - 3 minutes , but the coronal lines shows large rb asymmetries for @xmath36 minutes as described section  [ sec : rbdisk ] .",
    "unfortunately we do not have access to rb asymmetry maps of an identical region from the observations for both temperature regimes ( transition region and coronal lines ) .",
    "in addition we do not have simultaneous  observations to link the events with rbes . therefore further observational studies are needed .",
    "we have studied the thermodynamics of a plausible candidate for a type  ii spicule model using chromospheric , transition region , and coronal synthetic observables and compared them with observations .",
    "the driver of this candidate spicule has been studied by @xcite who found that it evolved naturally as a consequence of the magnetic field dynamics of the model ( which include flux emergence ) . in short , chromospheric material",
    "is ejected into the corona as plasma is squeezed horizontally by a strong lorentz force .",
    "the pressure increases and thus deflects the plasma and forces it to flow vertically along the magnetic field , most rapidly towards the low densities of the corona .",
    "several synthetic observables reproduce the observations .",
    "however , mostly in the chromosphere , some synthetic properties differ from the observations .",
    "the chromospheric diagnostics seem harder to reconcile with the observations than coronal diagnostics for obvious reasons : the chromosphere is a transition between the photosphere and corona where a mixture of various physical processes play a role such as , non - lte , non - equilibrium ionization , ion - neutral interaction effects , etc .",
    "in addition , calculating the synthetic observables is more complex for chromospheric lines than for coronal lines .",
    "in addition to this complexity , it is also clear that the simulated spicule is not very violent and shows chromospheric densities that seem to be too low by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "all of these issues likely help explain why the simulated spicule does not show a clear rbe signal : because of the low hydrogen density , the opacity is too low above @xmath103  mm so that not clear absorbing component in the wings of the synthetic profiles can be detected .",
    "such a component is observed in rbes on the sun . even though we find large differences between the observed and synthetic profiles , specially as seen on the disk , it is important to note that one can deduce what is missing and/or could help to mimic the observables by studying the differences in detail .",
    "the low density indicates that not enough chromospheric material is ejected into the corona and/or , as a result of the simplified magnetic field configuration , the spicule expands too fast in the corona due to the field expansion .",
    "we note that despite discrepancies between synthetic and real chromospheric observables , the physical properties such as the plasma being heated and accelerated along the spicule does seem to correspond with what is observed on the sun .",
    "the off - limb observables seem to show better agreement than the on - disk observables .",
    "the synthetic  and  emissions show structures and evolution that are ( in part ) similar to the observations .",
    "even though apparent upward velocities seem too low , the chromospheric signal of the synthetic spicule fades in a few seconds ( similar to observations ) . in the simulations this occurs as a result of being heated mainly by joule heating , and to a lesser extent by thermal conduction and advection .",
    "however , the synthetic  and  emission are fainter than the observed ones , perhaps because the spicule does not eject enough chromospheric material .",
    "it is interesting that we `` observe '' torsional behavior in the spicule that is similar to the observations @xcite .",
    "this rotation is seen not only in chromospheric lines but also in transition region lines and to a lesser extent in the coronal lines .",
    "this rotation is generated in the chromosphere as a result of the compression which leads to a high magneto baroclinic term .",
    "it is interesting to note that all the chromospheric dynamics of the spicule are at the low end of the observed range , i.e. , both upflows and rotation velocities are lower compared to observations by the same relative factor .",
    "the spicule shows emission in several transition region and coronal euv lines ( , -xiv , etc ) .",
    "the transition region lines show emission at the limb following a path that is similar to a parabolic profile and coronal lines show a wave like propagation into the corona ( @xmath1  km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the former type of evolution is a result of various heating contributions , and it does not show downflows . the latter type of evolution is a combination of waves , flows and a thermal conduction front .",
    "these evolutions seem in agreement with the observations @xcite . on the disk , two different brightenings",
    "have been observed in transition and coronal lines , one with the ejection of the spicule , and another one that increases slowly with time over a range of a few hundred seconds .",
    "some observational examples seems to have similar properties , but the brightenings from the observations are weaker than the synthetic ones .",
    "this difference may be a result of the magnetic field configuration , the computational domain is small and the heating on the sun can be expanded to larger distances along the magnetic field lines than in our simulation .",
    "the transition region and coronal lines show not only blue doppler shifts but also strong asymmetry and an increase of the line width in the spicule .",
    "in addition , we find a different time evolution of the properties of the profiles for transition region lines and coronal lines .",
    "the increase in doppler shift , line width and asymmetry lasts significantly longer in coronal lines .",
    "we show some observational examples of the duration of the doppler shifts and rb asymmetries of transition region and coronal lines where the synthetic results seem to agree with the observations .",
    "however further studies are needed because we were not able to compare transition region lines with coronal lines in the same region and time on the sun .",
    "in addition , in the observations we can not link the rb asymmetries events with rbes because we did not have simultaneous  observations . we also want to point out that it is crucial to combine the information of the doppler shift and the asymmetry of the line in order to correctly determine the plasma velocities . using only doppler shift or",
    "only asymmetries is likely to lead to incorrect conclusions about plasma velocities .",
    "we also take into account the effects of the spectral broadening and spatial resolution into these results .",
    "some of these lines may be impacted by the non - equilibrium ionization @xcite .",
    "several processes still need to be taken into account that will likely impact the synthetic diagnostics . at a minimum",
    "we need to include ion - neutral coupling effects , and non - equilibrium ionization .",
    "the latter plays a role for the energy properties of the chromospheric plasma @xcite , but also in some transition region euv line diagnostics @xcite .",
    "it is also crucial to increase the spatial resolution of the simulations and keep in mind that the joule heating in the model is dependent on numerical diffusivities and dissipation and that heating on the sun behaves differently .",
    "many properties of type  ii spicules , both from the observations and the model presented here , indicate that it can not be modeled properly in 1d models .",
    "for instance , from the observational point of view , the spicules experience torsional motions .",
    "many spicules seem to show multi - thread structuring . in the modeled type",
    "ii spicule the dominant acceleration and heating mechanisms vary significantly across the spicule , i.e. , perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "for instance , the compression caused by the lorentz force and the dissipated magnetic energy does not occur uniformly across the spicule .",
    "in fact , these processes vary in location and time , i.e. , different `` field lines '' experience different mechanisms , and the dominant mechanism(s ) at one location also evolve with time .",
    "the ejection and the expansion of the plasma is not uniformly distributed across the coronal part of the spicule .",
    "in addition , these `` field lines '' also experience changes in the magnetic connectivity , so both heating and acceleration jump from line to line in space and time .",
    "most importantly , the spicule is not a structure following a confined magnetic flux tube . in short ,",
    "all of these processes do not occur only along the field lines but also perpendicular to the field lines , something that is ignored in a 1d approach .",
    "the chromosphere in our numerical simulation is significantly different from the solar chromosphere in several aspects : it is not as dynamic as revealed by observations , and type  ii spicules occur much more frequently on the sun . in fact , we only have a single event that resembles ( in several aspects ) type  ii spicules .",
    "it is thus crucial to approach that deficiency in the models , and it needs to be investigated whether ion - neutral interactions , a more realistic treatment of the small - scale flux emergence , large scale motions or better spatial resolution can produce a more dynamic chromosphere . as mentioned above , the modeled ambient and emerging magnetic field is highly simplified .",
    "this may lead to the lack of dynamics and of type  ii spicules .",
    "it is also important to mention that other physical processes , such as reconnection , could drive type  ii spicules that might produce similar observables , but this needs to be investigated .",
    "finally , type  ii spicules are not occurring in the simulations as frequently as in the observations and the episodic nature of the rb asymmetry is missing in the models .",
    "a satisfactory model of spicules must be able to reproduce these observables too .",
