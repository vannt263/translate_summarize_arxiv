    "phase transitions in genuine nonequilibrium systems have been investigated often among reaction - diffusion ( rd ) type of models exhibiting absorbing states @xcite . in many cases mapping to surface growth , spin systems or stochastic cellular automata can be done .",
    "the classification of universality classes of second order transitions is still one of the most important uncompleted task .",
    "one hopes that symmetries and spatial dimensions are the most significant ingredients as in equilibrium cases , however it turned out that in many cases there is a shortage of such factors to explain novel universality classes .",
    "an important example was being investigated during the past two years that emerges at phase transitions of binary production systems @xcite ( pcpd ) . in these systems",
    "particle production competes with pair annihilation and single particle diffusion .",
    "if the production wins steady states with finite particle density appear in ( site restricted ) models with hard - core repulsion , while in unrestricted ( bosonic ) models the density diverges . by lowering the production / annihilation rate",
    "a doublet of absorbing states without symmetries emerges .",
    "one of such states is completely empty , the other possesses a single wandering particle . in case of site restricted systems",
    "the transition to absorbing states is continuous .",
    "although the nature of this transition has not completely been settled numerically and by field theory yet , an other novel class appearing in triplet production systems was proposed very recently @xcite ( tcpd ) .",
    "this reaction - diffusion model differs from the pcpd that for new particle generation at least three particles have to meet .",
    "it is important to note that these models do not break the dp hypothesis @xcite - according to which _ in one component systems exhibiting continuous phase transitions to single absorbing state ( without extra symmetry and inhomogeneity or disorder ) short ranged interactions can generate dp class transition only _ -",
    "because they exhibit multiple absorbing states that are not frozen , lonely particle(s ) may diffuse in them .",
    "a phenomenologically introduced langevin equation that exhibits real , multiplicative noise was suggested @xcite to describe the critical behavior of reaction - diffusion models of types @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 number of interacting particles ) in the form @xmath16 with noise correlations @xmath17 the classification of universality classes of nonequilibrium systems by the exponent @xmath18 of a multiplicative noise in the langevin equation was suggested some time ago by grinstein et al .",
    "however it turned out that there may not be corresponding particle systems to real multiplicative noise cases @xcite and an imaginary part appears as well if one derives the langevin equation of a rd system starting from the master equation in a proper way .",
    "this observation led howard and tuber to investigate systems with complex noise appearing in binary production models .",
    "unfortunately the cases with and without occupation number restriction turned out to be different in @xmath8 , although in @xmath4 this difference was found to disappear at criticality and below @xcite .    by rescaling eq.([langevin ] ) one can get the corresponding mean - field critical exponents @xmath19 the authors of @xcite expect that the noise exponent should be in the range @xmath20 hence by simple power counting the upper critical dimension should be @xmath21 this implies for a triplet processes : @xmath22 and for a quadruplet ( @xmath23 ) processes : @xmath24 .",
    "very recently kockelkoren and chat introduced stochastic cellular automata ( sca ) versions of general @xmath2 , @xmath3 type of models @xcite , where multiple particle creation on a given site is suppressed by an exponentially decreasing creation probability ( @xmath25 ) of the particle number .",
    "they claim that their simulation results in 1d are in agreement with the fully occupation number restriction counterparts and set up a general table of universality classes , where as the function of @xmath26 and @xmath27 only 4 classes exist , namely the directed percolation class @xcite , the parity conserving class @xcite , the pcpd and tcpd classes .    in any case",
    "the heuristic langevin equation with real noise assumption for rd models @xcite should be proven for @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore in low dimensions topological constraints may cause different critical behavior with and without occupation number restriction @xcite",
    ". note that in case of binary production models it had not been clear at all if the @xmath11 prediction of the bosonic field theory had also been true for site restricted systems until the numerical confirmation of @xcite . in this paper",
    "i show simulation results for lattice models with restricted site occupancy in @xmath29 with the aim of locating the upper critical dimensions and checking claims the of refs.@xcite about possible new universality classes .",
    "in this section i discuss the mean - field equation that can be set up for site restricted lattice models with general microscopic processes of the form @xmath30 with @xmath28 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that this formulation is different from that of eq.([langevin ] ) that is valid for coarse grained , continuous bosonic description of these reaction - diffusion systems . in this case",
    "the diffusion drops out and one can neglect the noise , hence the the competition of creation ( with probability @xmath35 ) and annihilation or coagulation ( parametrized with probability @xmath36 ) is left behind @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the site occupancy probability and @xmath39 is a dimension dependent coordination number .",
    "each empty site has a probability ( 1-@xmath38 ) in mean - field approximation , hence the need for @xmath40 empty sites at a creation brings in a @xmath41 probability factor . by expanding @xmath41 and keeping the lowest order contribution one can see that for site restricted lattice systems a @xmath42-th order term appears automatically with negative coefficient that regulates eq.([mfeq ] ) .",
    "the steady state solution can be found analytically in many cases and may result in different , continuous or discontinuous phase transitions .",
    "here i split the discussion of the solutions to three parts : ( a ) @xmath43 , ( b ) @xmath44 and ( c ) @xmath45 . in the inactive phases one expects a dynamical behavior described by the @xmath46 process , for which @xmath47 is known @xcite .      the steady state solution in this case can be obtained by solving @xmath48 where the trivial ( @xmath49 ) solution has been factored out . for the active phase one",
    "gets @xmath50^{1/k } , \\ ] ] which vanishes at @xmath51 with the leading order singularity @xmath52 and order parameter exponent exponent @xmath53 . at the critical point",
    "the time dependent behavior is described by @xmath54 that gives a leading order power - law solution @xmath55 hence @xmath56 .",
    "this was obtained from bosonic , coarse grained formulation in @xcite too .      in this case besides the @xmath49 absorbing state solution we can get an active state if @xmath57 is satisfied .",
    "both sides are linear functions of @xmath58 such that for @xmath59 only the @xmath49 is a solution .",
    "the left hand side is a convex function of @xmath38 ( from above ) with zeros at @xmath49 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore by increasing @xmath58 from zero the left hand side meets the right hand side at @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( see fig.[mfabr](a ) ) .",
    "if this solution is stable a first order transition takes place in the system . note that in higher order cluster mean - field solutions , where the diffusion can play a role the transition may turn into continuous one @xcite , therefore it is important to check the type of transition for @xmath63 . in section [ 2dsimunm ]",
    "i shall confirm the first orderedness of such transitions for two models in 2d .      by factoring out the trivial @xmath49 solution we are faced with the general condition for a steady state @xmath64 one can easily check that in this case the critical point is at @xmath65 ( see fig.[mfabr](b ) ) and here the density decays with @xmath66 as in case of the @xmath67 branching and @xmath68 annihilating models showed by cardy and tuber @xcite ( bkarw classes ) .",
    "however the steady state solution for @xmath28 gives different @xmath69 exponents than those of bkarw classes , namely @xmath70 .",
    "this imply novel kind of critical behavior in low dimensions , that should be a subject of further investigations @xcite .",
    "two dimensional simulations were performed on @xmath71 linear sized lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "one monte carlo step ( mcs )  corresponding to @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the number of particles )  is built up from the following processes . a particle and a random number @xmath74",
    "are selected randomly ; if @xmath75 a site exchange is attempted with one of the randomly selected empty nearest neighbors ( nn ) ; if @xmath76 @xmath40 number of new particles are created with probability @xmath77 at randomly selected empty nn sites provided the number of nn particles was greater than or equal @xmath26 ; or if @xmath76 @xmath78 number of particles are removed with probability @xmath79 ( taking into account the @xmath34 condition as well ) .",
    "the simulations were started from fully occupied lattices and the particle density decay was measured up to @xmath80 mcs .",
    "first i checked the dynamic behavior in the inactive phase for @xmath81 diffusion rate . at @xmath82",
    "one can see the appearance of the mean - field behavior @xmath83 following @xmath84 mcs . by decreasing @xmath79 this scaling sets in later and later times . as fig.[3a4a-3a2a_5 ] shows for @xmath85 systems with @xmath86 mcs curves with @xmath87 veer up  corresponding to the active phase  while curves with @xmath88 veer down  corresponding to the absorbing state . from the @xmath89 data i determined the effective exponents ( the local slopes ) defined as @xmath90   \\over \\ln(m ) } \\label{slopes}\\ ] ] ( where i used @xmath91 ) .",

    "density decays for several @xmath79-s in the active phase ( @xmath95 ) were followed on logarithmic time scales and averaging was done over @xmath96 independent runs in a time window , which exceeds the level - off time by a decade . the steady state density in the active phase at a critical phase transition",
    "is expected to scale as @xmath97 using the local slopes method one can get a precise estimate for @xmath69 as well as for the corrections to scaling @xmath98 where i used the @xmath99 value determined before .",

    "can one observe logarithmic corrections suggesting @xmath7 .",
    "the density decay simulations were repeated at @xmath103 , where the critical point was found at @xmath104 with mean - field like @xmath102 exponent again .      here",
    "simulations are much slower than in case of the triplet model , hence systems with linear size @xmath105 could be investigated .",

    "the effective exponent at @xmath99 extrapolates to @xmath111 . as one",
    "can see on this graph the separatrix ( critical ) curve exhibits a linear shape on the @xmath112 - @xmath113 scale suggesting logarithmic corrections to scaling .",
    "similarly the effective exponents of @xmath69 seem to extrapolate to @xmath114 ( fig.[beta_5 ] ) that is very far from the mean - field value @xmath53 .",
    "to check the possibility that a logarithmic correction can result in mean - field exponents the fitting with the lowest order correction @xmath115^{\\beta } \\label{blogfit}\\ ] ] has been applied for the steady state @xmath116 data .",
    "i used the non - linear fitting of the `` xmgr '' graphical package with a relative error in the sum of squares with at most 0.0001 .",

    "this result in agreement with the dynamical scaling conclusion may support that the upper critical dimension for quadruplet models is @xmath11 . to get more solid results further",
    ", very extensive simulations would be necessary that is beyond the scope of this study . in any case",
    "clear mean - field behavior ca nt be concluded .",
    "one can find two regions in the density decay behavior by varying @xmath79 in both models .",
    "for @xmath122 steady state values are reached quickly while for @xmath123 a rapid ( faster than power - law ) initial density decay crosses over to @xmath124 .",
    "this is in agreement with the mean - field behavior of the @xmath13 process in 1d @xcite dominating in the inactive phase . for the @xmath9 , @xmath13 quadruplet production model",
    "this threshold is at @xmath125 ( see fig.[4a5a-2a0_2d ] ) where an abrupt jump is observable from @xmath126 to @xmath127 . in case of the @xmath12 , @xmath121 triplet production model",

    "the @xmath143 curve exhibits a straight line shape for @xmath144 , while in sub(super)-critical cases @xmath143 curves veer down(up ) respectively . as one",
    "can see on fig.[3a4a-3a2a_1 ] following a long relaxation @xmath145 curves veer up , while @xmath146 curves veer down in the @xmath144 limit . from this one can estimate @xmath147 with @xmath93 in agreement with the results of @xcite .    by analyzing super - critical , steady state densities with the local slopes method one can read - off : @xmath148 ( see fig.[beta3a4a-3a2a_1 ] ) , which is higher than the results of @xcite and @xcite .    however one should be careful and check diffusion dependence and corrections to scaling especially because these critical exponent estimates are quite close to the mean - field values ( @xmath94 , @xmath53 ) and as it was shown in sect .",

    "just considering mean - field results , according to which @xmath40 does not play a role for @xmath43 models one may expect that the @xmath136 , @xmath137 triplet creation model exhibits the same kind of transition as the @xmath5 , @xmath6 model .",
    "indeed kockelkoren and chat s simulations show this @xcite . however doing lattice simulations with site restrictions it turned out that the @xmath136 creation was so effective that it shifted the transition to the zero production limit ( @xmath156 ) where the @xmath137 process in 1d is known to decay as @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "off - critical simulations showed that @xmath158 , meaning that this transition belongs to the bkarw mean - field class . on the other hand there may be other realizations of this model , where the transition reported by kockelkoren and chat is accessible .",
    "it has been established that in @xmath67 , @xmath159 and even @xmath40  so called even number of offspringed branching and annihilating models ( barwe )  the parity conserving ( pc ) class continuous phase transition emerges @xcite .",
    "this class has also been observed in models exhibiting @xmath160 symmetric absorbing states , where the domain walls separating ordered phases follow barwe dynamics @xcite .",
    "this class was originally called parity conserving , owing to the conservation law that made it different from the robust dp class .",
    "however it turned out that in @xmath160 symmetric models this conservation is not enough @xcite . furthermore in binary spreading models this conservation was found to be irrelevant @xcite .",
    "therefore it is still an open question whether parity conservation is relevant in other models than in barw types .",
    "i investigated the phase transition of the triplet production @xmath12 , @xmath121 model ( with explicit particle diffusion ) possessing parity conservation .",
    "as i showed in sect .",
    "[ 2dsimunm ] in two dimensions this system exhibits a first order transition in agreement with the mean - field results .",

    "this pattern resembles much more to those of the pcpd class models , where compact domains separated by clouds of lonely wandering particles occur .",
    "of course such qualitative judgment on the universal behavior is not enough but has been found to be quite successful in case of binary production systems @xcite .",
    "the density decay simulations at @xmath161 and @xmath103 have been analyzed by the local slopes method see fig.[3a5a-2a0_8 ] . at @xmath161",
    "the critical point is estimated at @xmath162 and the corresponding effective exponent tends to @xmath163 . at @xmath103-s",
    "the critical point is at @xmath164 , and the local exponent seems to extrapolate to @xmath165 .",
    "such small difference between the high and low @xmath166 results can also be observed by analyzing the steady state results : @xmath167 versus @xmath168 .",
    "these exponent estimates are far from the 1 + 1 d dp values ( @xmath169 , @xmath170 @xcite ) , hence the claim of kockelkoren and chat for the critical behavior of @xmath44 models is questionable .",
    "on the other hand the diffusion dependence of the critical exponents is a challenge and has been observed in the binary production pcpd model @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that assuming logarithmic corrections to scaling  that is quite common in 1d models  a single universality class can be supported numerically .",
    "therefore here again i have investigated the possibility of the collapse of the high and low @xmath166 exponents .",

    "here i show that in the one dimensional @xmath9 , @xmath175 and @xmath9 , @xmath13 site restricted models continuous phase transitions with @xmath178 and with non - trivial exponents can be found .",
