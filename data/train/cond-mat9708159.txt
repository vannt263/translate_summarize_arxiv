    "recent angle resolved photo - emission ( arpes ) measurements by wells _",
    "_  @xcite and by pothuizen _",
    "et al _  @xcite on the insulating copper oxide sr@xmath3cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 provide an unique experimental probe of the properties of a single hole in an anti - ferromagnetic background .",
    "theoretically this problem was analyzed in terms of a @xmath4 model using exact diagonalization techniques for small clusters  @xcite and the self - consistent born approximation ( scba )  @xcite . from recent evaluation of the hopping integrals",
    "it was concluded that the next - next nearest neighbor hopping matrix element @xmath2 is significant and almost as large as the diagonal hopping matrix element @xmath1 , so that @xmath2 should also be incorporated in a model hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "this was done in a recent paper  @xcite , where also the leading corrections to the scba were evaluated .",
    "the arpes experiments  @xcite are carried out at a temperature of 300 - 350k , which is above the neel temperature of this compound .",
    "theoretical treatments up to now , however , restrict themselves to the zero temperature limit , assuming long range anti - ferromagnetic order , and spectra are artificially broadened in order to compare with experiment .",
    "it is therefore important to extend the scba calculations to finite temperature , where long range anti - ferromagnetic order is lacking , although at room temperature the magnetic correlation length for this compound is still about 60 lattice spacings and no drastic deviation of the arpes spectrum at room temperature from the one at zero temperature is expected .",
    "another motivation for this work is that a scba technique that can cope with the absence of long range magnetic order may be extended in the future to describe the spin liquid state of the doped copper oxides .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional @xmath5 model at finite temperature .",
    "we apply the modified spin - wave theory suggested by takahashi for 2d heisenberg model at nonzero temperature  @xcite to deal with a state without long range anti - ferromagnetic order .",
    "the hamiltonian for @xmath5 model is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the creation operator of an electron with spin @xmath8 @xmath9 at site @xmath10 on the two - dimensional square lattice , @xmath11 represents nearest neighbor sites , @xmath12 next nearest neighbor sites ( diagonal ) , and @xmath13 represents next - next nearest sites .",
    "the spin operator is @xmath14 .",
    "the exchange derived from two magnon raman scattering is @xmath15  @xcite . following the most recent calculation of the hopping matrix elements performed by andersen _",
    "et al _  @xcite",
    "we take : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "we set @xmath19 , so that in these units @xmath20    we first calculate the hole green s function with fixed pseudo - spin at finite temperature , introduced by a constraint on the sub - lattice magnetization , and evaluate the contribution to the self energy due to the virtual absorption of spin - waves by the hole .",
    "then the hole green s function with fixed spin , that corresponds to green s function that is actually measured in arpes , is calculated .",
    "this green s function turns out to be close an infrared divergency and we show that this instability can be avoided by a proper renormalization , assuring that the results numerically converge even when a rather limited number of grid - points is used . we find that at non - zero temperature the quasi - particle peaks broaden and shift to lower energy .",
    "the shift is independent of momentum and is due to the larger effective hole bandwidth as at finite temperature the spin order is frustrated .",
    "at half filling ( one electron per site ) the model under consideration is equivalent to a heisenberg model .",
    "we are interested in the situation when one electron is removed from the system , when a single hole is produced .",
    "the dynamics of a single hole in an anti - ferromagnetic background can be described by scba  @xcite .",
    "this approximation works very well due to the absence of a single loop corrections to the hole - spin - wave vertex  @xcite .",
    "now we have to modify scba for finite temperature .",
    "the main complication is that at finite temperature there is no long range anti - ferromagnetic order . nevertheless , following takahashi  @xcite we introduce artificially two sub - lattices : up and down . the bare hole operator @xmath22 is defined so that @xmath23 on the @xmath24 sub - lattice and @xmath25 on the @xmath26 sub - lattice . in momentum representation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is number of sites and @xmath29 is the average magnetization . the brackets @xmath30 denote both quantum and statistical averaging .",
    "the quasi - momentum @xmath31 is restricted to be inside the magnetic brillouin zone : @xmath32 . in this notations",
    "it looks like @xmath33 has spin @xmath34 , but actually rotation invariance is violated and @xmath8 is a pseudo - spin which just labels the two sub - lattices .",
    "nevertheless the pseudo - spin gives the correct value of the spin @xmath35-projection : @xmath36 .",
    "the coefficients in ( [ d ] ) provide the correct normalization : @xmath37 the retarded hole green s function is defined as @xmath38 the @xmath1 , @xmath2 terms in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) correspond to the hole hopping inside one sub - lattice .",
    "this gives the bare hole dispersion @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . in equation ( [ e0 ] ) we took into account that the sign of a hole dispersion is opposite to that for an electron ( the maximum of the electron band corresponds to the minimum of the hole band ) , and omitted the constant term .",
    "the bare hole green s function is @xmath43    for spin excitations we use the modified spin - wave theory  @xcite ( see also review paper  @xcite ) . in order to treat the heisenberg term in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) within spin - wave theory ,",
    "it is convenient to use the dyson - maleev transformation  @xcite for a localized spin @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the fourier representation for @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48 the summation over @xmath49 , here and everywhere below , is restricted inside the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "there are essentially two ways to find an effective hamiltonian quadratic in the operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the first way is just to drop the quartic terms as is done in linear spin - wave theory ( lswt ) .",
    "the second way is to treat the quartic terms at mean - field level @xmath52 , corresponding to mean field spin - wave theory .",
    "as both approximations give very close results we choose use lswt because it is simpler in the present context .",
    "so far we followed the zero temperature derivation for the scba .",
    "we take the approach of calculating the finite temperature corrections to the hole green s function g@xmath53 with a diagrammatic , perturbative , method .",
    "this framework can be used if the number of spin - waves per site is small , i.e. if @xmath54 is not too large .",
    "this is a reasonable pre - requisition as in the experiments @xmath54 is of the order of 1/4",
    ". we will show later on that at these temperatures the number of spin - waves is actually small , justifying our approach .",
    "the advantage of this approach over performing the calculations at imaginary , matsubara , frequencies is that in our framework the absence of long - range anti - ferromagnetic order is specifically built in .",
    "also problems with the numerical analytic continuation on the real frequency axis are avoided . as is shown later on",
    ", an almost - divergency occurs that demands large lattices in order to get stable results . by performing the calculation on the real axis from the beginning",
    ", the green s function can be renormalized , lifting the almost - divergency .    at non - zero temperatures the long range anti - ferromagnetic order is destroyed .",
    "very many long - wave - length spin waves are excited , and one must take into account their non - linear interaction . an approximate way to do it is to impose an additional condition that the sub - lattice magnetization is zero  @xcite .",
    "@xmath55 this constraint gives an effective cutoff of unphysical states in dyson - maleev transformation .",
    "the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) is introduced into the hamiltonian via a lagrange multiplier @xmath56 .",
    "now we must diagonalize @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "this can be done by the bogoliubov transformation @xmath59 and we find the effective spectrum and bogoliubov parameters @xmath60 these equation show that at non - zero temperature the spin - wave spectrum has a gap  @xmath61 .",
    "this elucidates the meaning of the constraint and the lagrange multiplier . taking into account that in thermal equilibrium @xmath62 we obtain from ( [ constraint ] ) the equation for @xmath63 @xmath64 this equation gives an exponentially small @xmath63 , and hence an exponentially large magnetic correlation length @xmath65 .",
    "hopping to a nearest neighbor in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) gives an interaction of the hole with spin - waves .",
    "@xmath66 in diagrams we will denote the vertex @xmath67 by a dot , see figure  [ fig : fig3]d .",
    "this vertex is given by @xmath68 in this calculation the usual mean field factorization approximation @xmath69 has been used . for simplicity",
    "we have omitted in the calculation ( [ g ] ) the standard bose statistics factor @xmath70 , but they are certainly taken into account in the calculation of diagrams .",
    "we stress that the vertex ( [ g ] ) has the same form as in the case of zero temperature , except for the pseudo - gap in the bogoliubov parameters ( [ sw ] ) .",
    "we remind of the fact that at zero temperature @xmath71 because of the goldstone theorem . in the present case due to the pseudo - gap @xmath72 .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that the long range anti - ferromagnetic order is destroyed .",
    "however , as the pseudo - gap is small , its presence will not give rise to large effects in the spectra .",
    "similar to the zero temperature case the spin structure of the interaction ( [ hsw ] ) forbids single loop corrections to the hole - spin - wave vertex , so that the self energy is of the form @xmath73),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where first term arises from the virtual emission of the spin wave and second term arises from the virtual absorption , see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the self - consistent solution of this equation together with the standard relation @xmath74 gives the retarded green s function .",
    "due to the definition of the operators ( [ d ] ) the green s function ( [ gd ] ) is invariant under translation with the inverse vector of the magnetic sub - lattice @xmath75 @xmath76 in spite of the absence of the long range anti - ferromagnetic order .",
    "the numerical solution of equation ( [ dy ] ) is straightforward . to avoid poles we replace @xmath77 .",
    "the energy scale consists of 300 points with variable density ( concentrated near sharp structures of @xmath78 ) .",
    "the number of points in the magnetic brillouin zone is @xmath79 which is equivalent to a @xmath80 lattice .",
    "actually the results are almost independent of the grid as soon as it is larger than @xmath81 . in figure",
    "[ fig : cut ] @xmath82 as a function of @xmath83 for a cut through the brillouin zone from @xmath84 to @xmath85 is shown for two different temperatures .    the number of spin - waves per site for the highest temperature , @xmath86 , we considered , is @xmath87 , so much smaller than unity , justifying the perturbational approach .",
    "we recall that we use the set of parameters ( [ ts ] ) based on ref .",
    "the same set has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite for a zero temperature calculation .",
    "quasiparticle energies and residues obtained here are quite similar to that at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "we see from figure  [ fig : cut ] that temperature shifts the quasi - peaks positions to lower energy and broadens them .",
    "the explanation for this is that there are two contributions to the self - energy at non - zero temperatures .",
    "one term originates from virtual spin - wave emission processes and the other from virtual spin - wave absorption .",
    "the former contribution is also present at t=0 and is enhanced at finite temperatures by a factor @xmath88 , i.e. at finite temperature the interaction between the spin - waves and the hole is effectively increased due to this process .",
    "the matrix element for emission of an extra spin - wave is larger if the number of spin - waves already present is larger , because of the bosonic nature of the spin - waves .",
    "the part of the self - energy that is due to the spin - wave emission is multiplied by a factor larger than one at finite temperature , causing a shift of the quasi - particle peaks to lower energy that is nearly uniform in the brillouin zone and a shift of the incoherent part of the greens function to higher energies .",
    "this has a simple physical reason . at non - zero temperature",
    "the hole propagates more easily because the anti - ferromagnetic order is frustrated .",
    "this causes a uniform shift of all quasiparticle poles to lower energy and does not effect their dispersion , as the quasiparticle dispersion is determined predominantly by the magnetic interaction .",
    "so the effect of non - zero temperature is qualitatively different from the effects of doping , where it is found that a reconstruction of the quasiparticle dispersion takes place , attributed to the frustrated magnetic order in the doped system  @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the self - energy at finite temperature because of the spin - wave absorption is mainly responsible for the broadening of the quasi - particle peaks .",
    "the operators @xmath90 , @xmath91 discussed in the previous section are defined at different sub - lattices .",
    "the operators on two sub - lattices are useful as mathematical constructions but when a photon removes an electron from the system , it does not differentiate between the sub - lattices , and moreover , at nonzero temperature there are no sub - lattices at all .",
    "therefor we have to define the particle operator that is relevant for photo - emission independent of the sub - lattice .",
    "this particle operator is : @xmath92 the normalization is chosen in such a way that @xmath93 this is the green s function measured in arpes .",
    "now we have to find the relation between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the operator @xmath96 acting on half filled ground - state produces a single hole .",
    "we denote the corresponding amplitude by @xmath97 and denote it in figure  [ fig : fig3]a as a cross .",
    "the thick line corresponds to the green s function @xmath98 ( [ gc ] ) and the thin line corresponds to the @xmath78 ( [ gd ] ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath97 equals @xmath99    the operator @xmath96 acting on a state of the system can also produce a hole + spin - wave .",
    "this amplitude is shown in figure  [ fig : fig3]b as a circled cross with the dashed line being a spin - wave .",
    "we denote this amplitude by @xmath100 @xmath101 there is some ambiguity in the last step of this derivation .",
    "if we neglect the quartic term @xmath102 we get a value of @xmath100 by a factor @xmath103 larger than that given by eq .",
    "( [ bk ] ) . if we treat the quartic term on a mean field level then @xmath104 and we get a value of @xmath100 , a factor @xmath103 smaller than in eq.([bk ] ) .",
    "the correct value is somewhere in between .",
    "we choose the vertex @xmath100 to be the same as in the zero temperature case  @xcite .",
    "we will see that this provides the correct sum rule for the green s function @xmath98 , and this is a justification of our choice .",
    "we stress that ( [ bk ] ) is a bare vertex .",
    "it corresponds to the instantaneous creation of a hole + spin - wave , but not the creation of a hole with a subsequent decay into a hole + spin - wave .      at finite temperature",
    "there is another possibility : the creation of a hole with the absorption of a spin wave from the thermal bath .",
    "we denote this amplitude by @xmath105 .",
    "it is shown in figure  [ fig : fig3]c , and for simplicity we also denote it as a circled cross .",
    "the derivation of @xmath105 is quite similar to ( [ bk ] ) and the result is @xmath106 in eqs .",
    "( [ bk ] ) and ( [ ck ] ) we have omitted the standard bose statistics factors @xmath70 in ( [ bk ] ) and @xmath107 in ( [ ck ] ) .",
    "these factors are taken into account separately in the calculation of the diagrams .",
    "now we can find the relation between the green s functions @xmath98 ( [ gc ] ) and @xmath78 ( [ gd ] ) . in leading @xmath108 approximation",
    "it is given by the diagrams presented in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] where the thin solid line represents the bare hole green s function @xmath109 ( [ gd0 ] ) .",
    "each self - energy insertion should be understood as a combination of spin - wave emission and spin - wave absorption diagrams , similar to that in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "now let us dress these diagrams by higher orders in the hopping @xmath108 . as we already discussed above ,",
    "there is no single loop correction to the `` dot '' .",
    "we neglect double loop corrections to the `` dot '' as it has been done in scba .",
    "therefore the only possibility is an introduction of self energy corrections to @xmath78 .",
    "to take into account all these corrections we need just to replace all bare hole green s functions @xmath109 by dressed hole green s functions @xmath110 .",
    "so , [ fig : fig4 ] actually represents a dyson equation relating @xmath98 ( [ gc ] ) and @xmath78 ( [ gd ] ) . in analytical form",
    "it is @xmath111 where @xmath112,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath113.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      let us check now the sum rules .",
    "all singularities of the retarded green s functions are in the lower half plane of complex @xmath114 .",
    "therefore if we integrate eq.([dy ] ) over @xmath114 from @xmath115 to @xmath116 , this integral can be replaced by the integral over an infinite semi - circle in the upper @xmath114 half plane . for infinite @xmath114 , @xmath117 ,",
    "and we get the well known sum rule @xmath118 which agrees with eq.([norm ] ) .",
    "if we integrate eq.([dy2 ] ) in the same limits , the terms which contain more than one green s function give no contribution , because the integral can be transferred into the upper complex @xmath114 half plane , and we find @xmath119 \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & = 0.5+{2\\over{n}}\\sum_{\\bf q}\\left[(1+n_{\\bf q})v_{\\bf q}^2 + n_{\\bf q}u_{\\bf q}^2\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & = { 2\\over n}\\sum_{\\bf q } { { a}\\over{\\omega_{\\nu \\bf q}}}(1 + 2n_{\\bf q } ) = 1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used eqs .",
    "( [ sw ] ) and ( [ nu ] ) .",
    "thus equation ( [ dy2 ] ) reproduces the correct normalization : @xmath120 .",
    "this also proves that the vertices ( [ bk ] ) and ( [ ck ] ) are correct .",
    "the vertices @xmath100 ( [ bk ] ) and @xmath105 ( [ ck ] ) are invariant under translation by the inverse vector of magnetic sub - lattice @xmath75 : @xmath121 . at the same time",
    "the vertex @xmath67 ( [ g ] ) changes sign with this translation : @xmath122 .",
    "therefore the self energy @xmath123 changes sign at @xmath124 and @xmath125 the imaginary part of @xmath94 gives directly the spectra measured in arpes experiments .",
    "this green s function can be calculated using the dyson equation ( [ dy2 ] ) as soon as we have found @xmath78 in scba ( [ dy ] )",
    ".      numerical evaluation of @xmath98 at finite temperature , however , is more complicated than at t=0 .",
    "the problem lies in the infrared divergence of the integrand of @xmath126 at small @xmath49 . to clarify this we compare the small q behavior of the integrands of the self - energies @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "small q means that @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the magnetic correlation length . in this region",
    "the spin - wave mean occupation number is @xmath132 , and the vertices are @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "the self energy @xmath127 has an integrand @xmath135 .",
    "it is convergent at small q and therefore numerical calculation of @xmath127 is straightforward and the finite temperature generalization of scba is as simple as zero temperature scba . for the integrand of the self - energy @xmath129 on",
    "finds @xmath136 , which is also convergent at small q. the situation is different in self - energy @xmath128 : it is logarithmically divergent at small q : @xmath137 .",
    "there is no real divergence , however , because the integral is convergent at @xmath138 , but to calculate this integral numerically by `` brute force '' one needs a grid with @xmath139 .",
    "one then needs for example , when t=0.25 , a lattice of at least @xmath140 , and for lower temperatures",
    "an even a bigger lattice .",
    "we can avoid this problem by renormalizing @xmath128 , so that we can work with a reasonable grid - size .",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) in the form @xmath141 where @xmath142\\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\bf q}n_{\\bf q}c^2_{\\bf k , q } \\left [ g_d(\\epsilon + \\omega_{\\bf q},{\\bf k+q})- g_d(\\epsilon,{\\bf k})\\right],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath143.\\ ] ] numerical calculation of @xmath144 does not cause any trouble because it is well convergent at small q. on the other hand @xmath145 can be easily calculated analytically using the modified spin - wave theory equations ( [ sw ] ) and ( [ nu ] ) : @xmath146 . using this procedure the calculation",
    "can be done at arbitrary small temperature .",
    "the results are practically independent of the grid as soon as it is larger than @xmath81 .",
    "the plots of @xmath147 as a functions of @xmath114 for @xmath84 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 are presented in figure  [ fig : g_c ] .",
    "the half widths of quasiparticle peaks of @xmath98 are slightly larger than the half widths of quasiparticle peaks of @xmath78 .",
    "the spectra at t=0.01 quite well agrees with zero temperature calculation  @xcite .",
    "we stress that the agreement is not trivial . at t=0 long range",
    "anti - ferromagnetic order is assumed , and in the present work we used a quite different approach based on a state without long range order .",
    "the agreement indicates that these two approaches are consistent . for non - zero temperatures the trend in the spectra for @xmath98 is the same as for @xmath78 ; the temperature effect is to shift the quasi - particle peaks uniformly to lower energies and to broaden them .",
    "the spectra presented in figure  [ fig : g_c ] should be directly compared with arpes experimental data  @xcite .",
    "they reasonably reproduce positions and residues of experimental peaks , but fail to reproduce widths of the peaks .",
    "we considered the two - dimensional @xmath5 model at finite temperature , and developed a technique to deal with the state without long range anti - ferromagnetic order .",
    "there is hope to extend this technique to the spin liquid state of the doped system .",
    "we generalized the self - consistent born approximation to the case of nonzero temperature and derived the dyson equation which relates the single hole green s function with fixed spin to the single hole green s function with fixed pseudo - spin .",
    "this equation is sensitive to very large distances of order of magnetic correlation length and therefore not convenient for computations . to overcome this problem we developed a renormalization procedure which allows one to exclude large distances and to work with a relatively small lattice : the results are independent of the lattice size as soon as it is larger than @xmath81 .",
    "the effect of a finite temperature is a broadening and a shift of the quasi - particle peaks to lower energy , independent of the momentum .",
    "this is attributed to the frustrated magnetic order at finite temperature .",
    "the calculated arpes spectra demonstrate that temperature broadening is not enough to explain widths of the experimental spectra  @xcite .",
    "this strengthens the argument that other degrees of freedom contribute to the peak width  @xcite .",
