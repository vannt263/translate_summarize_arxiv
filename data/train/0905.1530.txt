    "in stellar evolution , the @xmath0c(@xmath10)@xmath3n reaction plays a key role for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , it is the first reaction in the carbon - nitrogen - oxygen ( cno ) cycle which dominates the energy production in stars with masses heavier than 1.5 m@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "secondly , the @xmath0c(@xmath14)@xmath3n(@xmath15)@xmath3c reactions can enhance the @xmath3c abundance @xcite , and thus influence the @xmath0c/@xmath3c ratio which is thought to be an important measure for stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the supply of @xmath3c by the @xmath0c(@xmath14)@xmath3n(@xmath15)@xmath3c reactions is also important for the @xmath3c(@xmath16)@xmath17o neutron source in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . a recent calculation with parametric one - zone nucleosynthesis showed that the more @xmath3c supply is needed at the end of the cno cycle in solar - metallicity stars @xcite . in view of the above mentioned significance",
    ", it is highly desired to carefully investigate the @xmath0c(@xmath10)@xmath3n cross section at energies below 1.0 mev for the astrophysical interest .",
    "the @xmath0c(@xmath10)@xmath3n reaction has been studied over a wide energy range down to about @xmath18 = 70 kev @xcite since 1950",
    ". however , there exists obvious discrepancy in the experimental data at the lower energies . in the even lower energy range ,",
    "no experimental data is available so far , and the astrophysical @xmath9 factors can only be derived by the extrapolation which results in uncertainty inevitably . in the energy range of @xmath18 @xmath19 200 kev ,",
    "the @xmath0c(@xmath10)@xmath3n reaction is dominated by the tail of the s - wave capture into the broad @xmath20 resonance at @xmath21 = 421 kev .",
    "although the contribution from direct capture is believed to be much smaller than that from the resonance tail , the interference between the two processes can lead to a considerable variation of @xmath9 factors , since both of them proceed via s - wave and then decay by @xmath22 transitions . as a result , the @xmath9 factors either increase by the constructive interference or decrease by the destructive one .",
    "thus the reliable experimental data on the direct capture are needed to derive the @xmath9 factors , particularly at energies of @xmath18 @xmath19 200 kev .",
    "a practicable scheme to deduce the @xmath9 factors for the direct capture in @xmath0c(@xmath10)@xmath3n is combining the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) of @xmath3n @xmath5 @xmath0c + @xmath6 and r - matrix approach @xcite , the anc can be deduced from the angular distribution of one proton transfer reactions .",
    "the ( @xmath1li,@xmath2he ) reactions are considered to be a valuable spectroscopic tool because the shapes of their angular distributions can be well reproduced by the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath0c(@xmath1li , @xmath2he)@xmath3n reaction is used to extract the nuclear anc of @xmath3n @xmath5",
    "@xmath0c + @xmath6 in the present work .",
    "the @xmath0c(@xmath1li , @xmath2he)@xmath3n angular distribution was measured at @xmath4(@xmath1li ) = 44.0 mev . the spectroscopic factor and anc",
    "were derived based on dwba analysis , and then used to calculate the astrophysical @xmath9 factors and rates of @xmath0c(@xmath14)@xmath3n direct capture reaction at energies of astrophysical interest with the r - matrix approach .",
    "we have also computed the contribution from the resonant capture and the interference effect between resonant and direct captures .",
    "the experiment was performed at the hi-13 tandem accelerator of beijing , china . a carbon target in thickness of 39.0",
    "@xmath23g/@xmath24 was bombarded with the 44.0 mev @xmath1li beam in intensity of about 100 pna .",
    "the @xmath2he ions from the @xmath0c(@xmath1li , @xmath2he)@xmath3n reaction were analyzed with the q3d magnetic spectrograph . in order to attain a good angular resolution , the solid angle for the reaction products",
    "was set to be 0.23 msr .",
    "a two dimensional position sensitive silicon detector ( pssd ) was placed at the focal plane of the spectrograph , which assured the full detection of @xmath2he ions emitted within the solid angle . during the measurement , a faraday cup placed at 0@xmath25 in the reaction chamber",
    "was utilized to record the beam current which served as the normalization standard in determining the absolute cross section , while two independent silicon detectors ( ssds ) at @xmath7 30@xmath26 were used for both monitoring the beam balance and relative normalizing the measured cross sections .",
    "the normalization was checked for several angles from 23@xmath25 to 40@xmath25 with the elastic scattering data of 36.0 mev @xmath1li on @xmath0c @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0c(@xmath1li , @xmath2he)@xmath3n differential cross sections were measured in the angular range of 7@xmath26 @xmath19 @xmath27 @xmath19 23@xmath26 , corresponding to 11@xmath26 @xmath28 37@xmath26 . the measured angular distribution is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the experimental errors are from the uncertainties of statistics , target thickness ( 5% ) and solid angle ( 6% ) .",
    "angular distribution of the @xmath0c(@xmath1li , @xmath2he)@xmath3n reaction at e(@xmath1li ) = 44.0 mev.,height=7 ]",
    "the spins and parities of @xmath0c and @xmath3n ground states are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0c(@xmath1li , @xmath2he)@xmath3n cross section is dominated by the ( 0@xmath31,0 ) @xmath5 ( 1/2@xmath32,1/2 ) transition , thus only @xmath33 orbit in @xmath3n can be populated .",
    "if the reaction is peripheral , the differential cross section can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the measured and calculated differential cross sections respectively . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the nuclear ancs of @xmath3n @xmath5 @xmath0c + @xmath6 and @xmath1li @xmath5 @xmath2he + @xmath6 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 being the single particle ancs of the bound state protons in @xmath3n and @xmath1li , which can be calculated with the bound state single particle wave function and whittaker function at larger radius .",
    "the ratio of c / b is so called spectroscopic factor .",
    "the proton spectroscopic factor of @xmath1li was derived to be 0.41 @xmath7 0.05 in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the nuclear anc of @xmath3n ground state can then be extracted by normalizing the theoretical differential cross sections to the experimental data via eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .    the angular distribution of the @xmath0c(@xmath1li , @xmath2he)@xmath3n reaction was calculated with the dwba code fresco @xcite .",
    "the bound state wave function was obtained by solving the schrdinger equation using a woods - saxon potential with standard geometrical parameters ( @xmath41 = 1.25 fm and @xmath42 = 0.65 fm ) , the potential depth was adjusted so as to reproduce the observed binding energy of the valence proton .",
    "the optical potential parameters for both the entrance and exit channels were extracted by fitting the angular distributions of elastic scattering with the code sfresco @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1li + @xmath0c elastic scattering was measured in the present work . since there is no experimental data for @xmath2he elastic scattering on @xmath3n , the angular distribution of @xmath2li + @xmath3c elastic scattering at @xmath43 = 28.0 mev @xcite",
    "was used to extract the potential parameters of the exit channel .",

    "the @xmath0c(@xmath10)@xmath3n cross section depends on the tail of the s - wave capture into the broad @xmath20 resonance at @xmath21 = 421 kev , the direct capture to the ground state and their interference .",
    "the determination of the resonant parameters for the @xmath20 state and the anc of @xmath3n ground state is helpful in extrapolating the experimental data at high energies down to the energies of astrophysical interest ( around 25 kev ) .",
    "we measured the angular distribution of the @xmath0c(@xmath1li , @xmath2he)@xmath3n reaction at @xmath50 = 44.0 mev , and deduced the nuclear anc and spectroscopic factor for the @xmath3n ground state . the astrophysical s - factors and reaction rates of @xmath0c(@xmath14)@xmath3n",
