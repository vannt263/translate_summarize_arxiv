    "being planned to start around 2020/2022 , the deep inelastic electron - nucleon scattering at the lhc ( lhec ) machine is a possible extension of the current lhc at cern , an electron - proton collider @xcite .",
    "it is a convenient way to go beyond the lhc capabilities , exploiting the 7 tev proton beams which will be produced at the lhc , to drive research on @xmath3 and @xmath4 physics at some stage during the lhc time .",
    "this lhc extension will open a new kinematic window - the @xmath5 cm energy can reach up to tev scale , far beyond the @xmath6 200 gev at hera , a very proficuous region for small-@xmath7 physics and many other physics studies .",
    "in particular , the energy of the incoming proton is delivered by the lhc beam , and a list of possible scenarios is considered for the energy of the incoming electron as @xmath8 tev and @xmath9 gev , corresponding to the center of mass energies of @xmath10 tev @xcite .",
    "the anticipated integrated luminosity is of order @xmath11 fb@xmath12 that depends on the energy of the electron beam and also the machine design .    despite of great successes of the standard model ( sm ) and difficulties in finding new physics such as supersymmetry , which is the most popular scenario ,",
    "the non - abelian self - couplings of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the photon remain poorly measured up to now . in this context",
    ", the investigation of three gauge boson couplings plays an important role to manifest the non - abelian gauge symmetry in standard electroweak theory .",
    "their precision measurement will be the crucial test of the structure of the sm .",
    "the inclusive and exclusive production of @xmath13 and @xmath14 at the lhc already provides important tests of the sm and beyond .",
    "however , the photoproduction channel has the advantage of being much cleaner than the @xmath15 collision channels .",
    "the physics program of the lhec will explore the high - energy domain complementing the lhc and its discovery potential for physics beyond the sm with the great precision dis measurements at high luminosities .",
    "the design report already contains @xcite some estimates for a variety of electroweak interaction processes such as leptoquarks / leptogluons , new heavy leptons , new physics in boson - quark interactions , and sensitivity to a higgs boson . in this work",
    "we investigate the photoproduction of massive gauge bosons at the tev scale and also examine the potential of the lhec collider to probe anomalous ww@xmath16 coupling . along these lines , we propose some observables that are sensitive to deviations from sm physics .",
    "previous theoretical studies on such a subject are quite compelling , and the @xmath2 vertex in @xmath3 colliders was addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite long ago .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold - first , we show predictions for the photoproduction of massive gauge bosons at future lhec energies within sm physics .",
    "the photoproduction cross section including the resolved and direct processes are obtained , as well as their number of events in the most promising final states decays .",
    "we then go beyond it , with the photoproduction of @xmath13 bosons , analyzing the production rates of @xmath13 bosons , as they move away from the sm .",
    "the sensitivity of the lhc for deviations from the sm is investigated , and some additional observables are proposed .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "the basic formulas to calculate the photoproduction of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and virtual photons are presented in the next section , including the expressions for the anomalous coupling in the @xmath13-production case .",
    "our numerical results for the photoproduction cross section and event rates within the sm and beyond are presented in section [ wbeyond ] , followed by the corresponding discussion .",
    "the summary and conclusions are presented in section [ conc ] .",
    "let us start by considering the c and p parity conserving effective lagrangian for two charged w - boson and one photon interactions @xcite .",
    "the motivation is to use the @xmath13 photoproduction cross section as a test of the @xmath2 vertex .",
    "in such a case , it is introduced by two dimensionless parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are related to the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments , namely , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the case of values @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "the sm is recovered at tree level .",
    "we are left with three diagrams for the subprocess @xmath23 and only t - channel w exchange graph contributes to the @xmath2 vertex .",
    "the unpolarized differential cross section for the subprocess @xmath24 can be obtained using helicity amplitudes from summing over the helicities . for the signal",
    ", we are considering a quark jet and an on - shell w with leptonic decay mode @xmath25 , where @xmath26 . in the current mode , the charged lepton and the quark jet",
    "are nicely separated and the signal is prevented from being in the background of the sm .",
    "the cross section for the subprocess @xmath27 is composed of the direct and resolved - photon production , @xmath28 .",
    "the direct - photon contribution is given by @xcite @xmath29 \\log{\\hat{z}}+   [ ( 2\\kappa+{{(1-\\kappa)^{2}}\\over{16 } } ) { 1\\over \\hat{z } } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & ( { 1\\over 2 }   +   { { 3(1+|e_{q}|^{2})}\\over{2}})\\hat{z }   + ( 1+\\kappa)|e_{q}|-{{(1-\\kappa)^{2}}\\over{16 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { |e_{q}|^{2}\\over 2}](1-\\hat{z } ) -{{\\lambda^{2}}\\over{4\\hat{z}^{2}}}(\\hat{z}^{2}-2\\hat{z } \\log{\\hat{z}}-1)\\nonumber \\\\ & + & { { \\lambda}\\over{16\\hat{z } } } ( 2\\kappa+\\lambda-2)[(\\hat{z}-1)(\\hat{z}-9 ) + 4(\\hat{z}+1)\\log{\\hat{z}}]\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{sigmadir}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the cutoff scale in order to regularize the @xmath33-pole of the collinear singularity for massless quarks .",
    "in addition , @xmath34 is the scale that determines the running of photon structure functions in the resolved part .",

    "the direct part of the cross section then reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the parton distributions functions in the proton , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the resolved - photon part of the cross section can be calculated using the usual electroweak formula for the @xmath41 fusion process , @xmath42 . for the photoproduction cross sections one needs parton distribution functions inside the photon and proton .",

    ".    similar calculation can be done for the @xmath14 boson photoproduction . here , we focus on the sm prediction . once again",

    "\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the next section we compute the numerical results for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction cross section in the lhec regime of energy / luminosity .",
    "we also investigate the sensitivity to anomalous @xmath2 couplings associated to beyond sm physics .",
    "let us now perform a preliminary study for the lhec machine @xcite . using the design with an electron beam having laboratory energy of @xmath56 gev , the center of mass energy will reach @xmath57 tev and a nominal luminosity of order @xmath58 @xmath59s@xmath12 .",
    "our estimates for the massive boson photoproduction cross sections in the sm are the following .",
    "one gets @xmath60 pb and @xmath61 pb .",
    "these are roughly estimates , since we have not introduced the @xmath62-factors associated with next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections to the processes .",
    "we have summed the resolved and direct contributions .",
    "the energy behavior for the cross section is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",

    "@xmath1 gauge bosons as a function of the cm energy . ]    in table [ tab1 ] the photon - proton total cross sections times branching ratio of @xmath66 and the corresponding number of events are shown for sm parameters for w ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) and also for the @xmath1 boson with a corresponding branching ratio of @xmath67 .",
    "the number of events has been computed using @xmath68 . at this point",
    "we consider the acceptance in the leptonic channel as 100% .",

    "@xmath70 and we impose a cut of @xmath71 .    through the calculations , proton structure functions of cteq @xcite and photon structure functions of grv @xcite have been used with @xmath72 .",
    "the usual electroweak parameters are taken from ref .",
    "we have assumed an integrated luminosity @xmath73 at 10 fb@xmath12 @xcite in order to compute the number of events , @xmath74 .",
    "the number of events is large enough to put forward further analysis , as we have units of events per second for @xmath0 .",
    ".the photon - proton cross sections times branching ratios @xmath75 and @xmath76 in units of pb . the number of events @xmath74 is also presented at an integrated luminosity 10 fb@xmath12 .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we have already noticed , the cross sections for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 production may have contributions due to higher - order terms that where not included in our calculation .",
    "cross sections in nlo considering the default standard model vertices were already calculated in @xcite . in order to get rid of normalization uncertainties , one can take the ratios @xmath77 to test the @xmath2 vertex and the @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters . to do this",
    "we propose the study of the following observable : @xmath78 which can be constructed from equations given in the previous section .",
    "such an observable was already proposed some time ago , in refs . @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ ratiowz ] we show our results for the @xmath79 ratio , for hera and lhec energies . in the left plot , the dependence of the ratio is shown as a function of the @xmath17 parameter for fixed @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , in the right plot the ratio is presented as a function of the @xmath18 parameter for fixed @xmath80 .",
    "the results are presented for both desy - hera and lhec energies .",
    "we can study the sensitivity with @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters , regarding the sm and possible new physics .",
    "the results show that the ratio has much more sensitivity to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters for lhec energies . regarding the @xmath18 parameter",
    ", it is unimportant at hera energies . thus , the lhec collider would be able to pin down the correct values for these parameters and then determine the magnet dipole and electric quadrupole of the @xmath13 .",
    "another observable that could be studied and tested at the lhec is the @xmath81 asymmetry , defined by    @xmath82    the results for this asymmetry are shown in fig .",
    "[ asy ] , where we show the sensitivity with the @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters .",
    "as we can see , for lhec energies the @xmath81 asymmetry depends strongly on the @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters and is therefore a useful observable to help determine the best scenarios . in the left plot",
    "we show the dependence of asymmetry as a function of the @xmath17 parameter for fixed @xmath22 ( its sm value ) only for the lhec energy .",
    "moreover , in the right plot we present the ratio as a function of the @xmath18 parameter for fixed @xmath80 , where the corresponding result for desy - hera energy is also shown . as a general conclusion about the anomalous coupling",
    ", we see that with the lhec collider the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 have better sensitivity than desy - hera @xmath3 collider , and it would give complementary information to the lhc collider .",
    "finally , let us compare the present calculation to previous studies . in ref .",
    "@xcite the massive boson photoproduction is considered for an energy of @xmath83 tev and integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath12 .",
    "for the sm values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters , the photoproduction cross section was obtained as @xmath84 pb , @xmath85 pb and @xmath86 pb for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath1 , respectively . the number of events for @xmath1 was estimated to be 360 .",
    "these results are completely consistent with ours when considering the integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath12 .",
    "concerning the sensitivity to the parameters , we found the general trend is similar ; however , the cross sections for higher values of parameters are relatively larger than ours . we have checked that our ratio @xmath89 is 50 % smaller than in ref .",
    "@xcite for several values of parameters @xmath90 .",
    "this probably is due the different energy and the theoretical uncertainties coming from the pdfs considered .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an analysis quite similar to ours was performed focusing on the spectrum of the backscattered laser photon ( energy of @xmath91 tev and integrated luminosity of 200 pb@xmath12 ) .",
    "for a weizscker - williams spectrum , we have checked that the numbers of events in process @xmath92 is quite consistent with ours when considering the same integrated luminosity .",
    "their original values are , for instance , 288 and 1151 events for sets ( @xmath93 ) and ( @xmath94 ) , respectively .",
    "the compatibility is good , as we are using a luminosity 100 times larger .",
    "the photoproduction of the @xmath13 boson at hera has been addressed at the nlo level of qcd corrections in ref .",
    "the prediction is @xmath95 pb and @xmath96 pb at @xmath97 gev , imposing a cut @xmath98 gev .",
    "the main conclusion is that the qcd corrections reduce the factorization scale dependence significantly and modify the leading - order prediction by a factor 10% .",
    "this can be used as a good argument for our lo calculations here .",
    "in addition , we can rescale their prediction for the lhec case .",
    "a rough estimate would give @xmath99 pb and @xmath100 pb at the lhec .",
    "this is smaller than our results in table 1 , where one has @xmath101 pb , which is is associated with the cut on boson transverse momentum and distinct kinematic cuts in the integration of the weizscker - williams spectrum .",
    "we have examined the prospects for massive gauge bosons detection at the proposed deep inelastic electron - nucleon scattering at the lhc ( lhec ) machine .",
    "the photon - proton cross sections have been computed for @xmath0 and @xmath1 inclusive production and are of the order of dozens of picobarns .",
    "the number of events is evaluated for the photoproduction cross section , assuming an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath12 and , they are large enough to make the measurements feasible . we have also investigated the anomalous @xmath2 coupling using the machine design .",
    "we found that the likelihood of that kinematic limit to be available at the lhec is somewhat increased relative to the previous desy - hera machine .",
    "we have tested some sample scenarios beyond sm physics by scanning the values of parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 considering anomalous @xmath2 coupling . in the case of anomalous coupling",
    ", the photoproduction process at the lhec proves to be a powerful tool .",
    "finally , we consider different observables that together could contribute to pinning down the correct @xmath2 vertex .",
    "we introduced the ratio @xmath102 , which is less sensitive to the nlo qcd corrections and the @xmath13-asymmetry observable @xmath103 that scanns asymmetries in the @xmath13-photoproduction .",
