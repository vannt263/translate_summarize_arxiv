    "<S> using angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy we investigate the surface electronic structure of the three - dimensional topological insulator ( ti ) sb@xmath0te@xmath1(0001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our data show the presence of a topological surface state in the bulk energy gap with the dirac - point located above the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the adsorption of cs - atoms on sb@xmath0te@xmath1(0001 ) gives rise to a downward energy shift of the electronic valence band states which saturates at a value of @xmath2200  mev . </S>",
    "<S> for the saturation coverage the dirac - point of the linearly dispersive surface state resides in close proximity to the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure of the cs / sb@xmath0te@xmath1 interface therefore considerably deviates from previously studied metal - ti interfaces based on the isostructural compound bi@xmath0se@xmath1 which points to the importance of atomic composition in these hetero systems .    </S>",
    "<S> three - dimensional topological insulators ( tis ) are currently generating widespread scientific interest in the condensed matter physics community as the distinct topology of their bulk band structure provokes the existence of robust metallic surface states with unique physical properties.@xcite the surface states locally span the global energy gap in the electronic excitation spectrum of the bulk material and their existence is protected by time - reversal symmetry.@xcite a salient feature of topological surface states ( tsss ) lies in their characteristic spin structure introduced by spin - orbit coupling which locks the spin to the direction perpendicular to the wave vector.@xcite as a consequence of this spin structure the backscattering of the surface state electrons from non - magnetic impurities is strongly suppressed.@xcite currently , most research on tis is devoted to the chalcogenide semiconductors bi@xmath0se@xmath1@xcite and bi@xmath0te@xmath1@xcite , related ternary compounds@xcite as well as to hgte quantum wells.@xcite the tsss of these materials show a particularly simple dispersion consisting of a single spin - polarized dirac - cone .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental realization of the most appealing properties of tsss that have been predicted so far will require interface structures between tis and metal films . </S>",
    "<S> this holds for example for the topological magnetoelectric effect at the interface of a ti and a ferromagnet@xcite as well as for majorana fermions at the interface of a ti and a superconductor.@xcite it is therefore important to investigate the influence of metallic adlayers on the electronic structure of ti surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> surface - sensitive spectroscopic techniques and in particular angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) , which also played a key role in the discovery of tis @xcite , are suitable methods to study modifications in the electronic structure during the formation of interfaces @xcite . indeed , great experimental effort on the basis of arpes is currently directed towards an improved understanding of the influence of adsorbates on the electronic structure of ti surfaces.@xcite however , most of these works have focused on the ti surface bi@xmath0se@xmath1(0001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore appears essential to expand the present investigations to other ti surfaces in order to obtain a broader picture .    </S>",
    "<S> the studies mentioned above showed that several adsorbed metal species , such as cu,@xcite fe,@xcite rb,@xcite cs@xcite or gd@xcite , shift the electronic states at the bi@xmath0se@xmath1(0001 ) surface , including the tss , to higher binding energies by several hundred mev , possibly due to band bending effects . in all cases the dirac - point of the tss is thus located approximately 0.5  ev or even further below the fermi energy when the saturation coverage is reached for which the electronic states cease to shift upon further increase of coverage ( see e.g. ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , significant deviations from the linear dispersion close to the dirac - point have been observed to occur for the tss of bi@xmath0se@xmath1(0001 ) upon metal adsorption.@xcite we will show in the following that the situation for the interface cs / sb@xmath0te@xmath1(0001 ) is largely different from the mentioned examples involving bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .    despite early theoretical predictions of sb@xmath0te@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> as a 3d ti,@xcite experimental investigations of its surface electronic structure have remained scarce when compared to the isostructural counterparts bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and bi@xmath0te@xmath1.@xcite recent spin - resolved arpes experiments provide direct evidence for the non - trivial topology of sb@xmath0te@xmath1.@xcite furthermore , remarkable progress in the fabrication of high - quality mbe - grown samples has recently been reported.@xcite    in this paper we investigate the electronic structure of the clean sb@xmath0te@xmath1(0001 ) surface and its modification upon cs - adsorption using arpes experiments . for the pristine surface </S>",

    "<S> similarly to the present case , metal adsorption on this surface was observed to induce a downward shift of the electronic states to lower energies.@xcite unlike for sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , however , the energetic position of the dirac - point at the respective saturation coverages was determined to lie far below the fermi level for interfaces with bi@xmath0se@xmath1(0001 ) ( @xmath2500  mev ) , even in the case of bulk @xmath23-doped samples@xcite . </S>",
