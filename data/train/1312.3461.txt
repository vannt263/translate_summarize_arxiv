    "<S> kalmeyer - laughlin ( kl ) chiral spin liquid ( csl ) is a type of quantum spin liquid without time - reversal symmetry , and it is considered as the parent state of an exotic type of superconductor  anyon superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> such exotic state has been sought for more than twenty years ; however , it remains unclear whether it can exist in realistic system where time - reversal symmetry is breaking ( t - breaking ) spontaneously . by using the density matrix renormalization group , </S>",
    "<S> we show that kl csl exists in a frustrated anisotropic kagome heisenberg model ( khm ) , which has spontaneous t - breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our model has two topological degenerate ground states , which exhibit nonvanishing scalar chirality order and are protected by finite excitation gap . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we identify this state as kl csl by the characteristic edge conformal field theory from the entanglement spectrum and the quasiparticles braiding statistics extracted from the modular matrix . </S>",

    "<S> topological order , an exotic state of matter that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles with anyonic braiding statistics , is one of the core topics in modern condensed - matter physics @xcite . quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) @xcite is a prominent example of topological order , which is thought to exist in some frustrated magnets @xcite . among various types of qsl @xcite , there is a class of time - reversal symmetry violating qsl called chiral spin liquid ( csl ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> csl shares some similar properties with fractional quantum hall effect , however csl is special for its both possessing topological order and spontaneously time - reversal symmetry breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest csl is the kalmeyer - laughlin ( kl ) csl ( @xmath0 laughlin state ) @xcite , in which spinons obey semionic fractional statistics . </S>",
    "<S> it is theoretically shown that if one dopes the kl csl with holes @xcite , an exotic type of superconductivity  anyon superconductivity @xcite  will emerge . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by the fundamental interest and prospect of finding exotic superconductors , kl csl has attracted much interest @xcite . in past many years , there was no experimental or theoretical evidence supporting the existence of this state until very recently . </S>",
    "<S> several artificial models were found that can host a kl state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one can directly induce scalar chirality order by a 3-spin parity and time - reversal - violating interaction @xcite on a kagome lattice to produce kl state . </S>",
    "<S> however , it remains elusive whether the kl state can exist in a system with time - reversal symmetry , which may be more closely related to real materials . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that kl state may exist in magnetic frustrated systems through spontaneously breaking time - reversal symmetry  @xcite , which are among the most difficult systems for theorists to study exactly .    in this letter , we show that the kl state is the ground state of a frustrated anisotropic kagome heisenberg model ( khm ) by using density matrix renormalization group @xcite , a numerical method which has been proven powerful in solving quasi - one - dimensional frustrated systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the previous systems with multiple spin interactions @xcite , the system we study here only involves two spin interactions , and the hamiltonian has time - reversal symmetry . by the technique developed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we find two topologically degenerate ground states , both of which break time - reversal symmetry spontaneously and exhibit a nonvanishing scalar chirality order . </S>",
    "<S> we also get a finite energy excitation gap and small correlation length , which support that we have a gapped phase . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the entanglement spectrum of the ground states fits the edge conformal field theory of the kl state . </S>",
    "<S> last but not least , we calculate the modular matrix using the two ground states @xcite , which gives the braiding statistics @xcite of emergent anyons that is the same as what is expected for the kl state . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",

    "<S> the csl spontaneously breaks time - reversal symmetry ; thus , we use both real and complex variable codes , although the hamiltonian is real . </S>",
