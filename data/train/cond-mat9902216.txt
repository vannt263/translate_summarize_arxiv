    "stochastic resonance ( s.r ) is an important phenomena with considerable implications in all branches of science @xcite .",
    "the enhanced response of a nonlinear system to input signals at the expense of and as a function of noise is termed as stochastic resonance .",
    "it is generally accepted that sr can be observed provided certain essential conditions are fulfilled .",
    "attempts are being continually made to reduce the number and stringency of these constraints for the realization of the phenomenon .",
    "the simplest and the minimal ( currently accepted ) conditions under which conventional sr can be observed are , the presence of a ) a bistable system , b ) a tunable gaussian white noise and c ) a time varying periodic signal ( force ) .",
    "recently , hu @xcite suggested that the last ingredient may hopefully be replaced by a constant force and , by implication , sr may be observed , e.g , in the drift velocity ( mobility ) of an overdamped brownian particle in a tilted periodic potential as a function of noise strength .",
    "unfortunately the suggestion was proved to be incorrect @xcite . however , marchesoni , @xcite by analyzing the work of risken @xcite , observed that sr can be observed in the drift velocity of brownian particles in a tilted periodic ( washboard ) potential only in the underdamped situation where friction acts as surrogate to the external periodic drive . in the present work",
    "we show that sr can be observed in the mobility of even an overdamped brownian particle in a tilted periodic potential ( without the presence of oscillating field ) but in the presence of a space - dependent periodic friction coefficient ( i.e. , in an inhomogeneous medium ) .",
    "the space dependence of friction coefficient does not affect the equilibrium properties such as the equilibrium probability distribution .",
    "however , it does affect the dynamical ( nonequilibrium ) properties of the system ( such as the relaxation rates ) .",
    "the space dependence of friction @xmath0 can be microscopically modeled through the nonlinear ( space - dependent ) coupling between the particle degrees of freedom and the thermal bath ( characterized by its equilibrium temperature ) @xcite . in this work",
    "we find that the mobility of overdamped particles in a sinusoidal potential subject to a sinusoidal friction coefficient but with a phase difference @xmath1 shows a peak as a function of noise strength ( temperature of the bath ) in the presence of only a constant force field @xmath2 . by properly choosing @xmath1",
    "we obtain this sr behaviour in the mobility ( defined as drift velocity divided by @xmath2 ) even for a small constant external force field ( when the barrier for the particle motion in the tilted periodic potential remains finite ) .",
    "the motion of an overdamped particle , in a periodic potential @xmath3 and subjected to a space - dependent friction coefficient @xmath0 and an additional constant force @xmath2 , at temperature @xmath4 , is described by the fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "@xmath5\\ ] ] one can calculate @xcite the probability current @xmath6 , for the potential function @xmath3 with @xmath7 , as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the mobility ( defined @xcite as the ratio of the drift velocity , @xmath11 divided by the applied force @xmath2 ) , @xmath12 .",
    "we take @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , @xmath16 as @xmath17 , but the mobility @xmath18 remains finite as @xmath19 , for nonzero temperature @xmath4 .",
    "however , for @xmath20 as @xmath21 , @xmath22 . also , as @xmath23",
    "however , for given @xmath24 and @xmath1 , in order to find the variation of @xmath18 at intermediate @xmath4 and @xmath2 , one needs to evaluate the double integral in the denominator of eqn .",
    "( 2 ) numerically @xcite .",
    "the variation of mobility @xmath18 in the parameter space of @xmath25 provides a very rich structure where the phase lag @xmath1 plays an important role .",
    "however , in this paper we report only the variation of @xmath18 with temperature ( noise strength ) @xmath4 at a few carefully selected values of @xmath26 in order to highlight the observability of s.r .    from eqn .",
    "( 2 ) one can find that , even though @xmath27 , except for phase lag @xmath28 or @xmath29 , but yet @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , we need to explore only @xmath31 . also in order to observe sr the choice of larger values of @xmath24 is found to be more appropriate .",
    "so we take @xmath32 and explore the full range of @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "we find that there is a range of values of @xmath1 within which sr is observed .",
    "for example , for @xmath34 , sr is observed but the peaks are very broad . and for this @xmath1 , sr is more prominent for @xmath35 than @xmath36 . for smaller",
    "@xmath1 it is harder to observe the peaks as they become still broader .",
    "however , as @xmath1 is increased the peaks become sharper .",
    "fig.1 shows the mobility @xmath18 ( in dimensionless units @xmath37 ) as a function of @xmath4 ( in dimensionless units ) for @xmath38 and @xmath39 . here",
    "the peaks are larger for @xmath35 than for @xmath36 .",
    "2 , shows the mobility @xmath18 as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "it can be seen that the peaks are almost flat for @xmath42 , but are prominent for the intermediate temperature range . from fig .",
    "3 , we do not observe s.r for any @xmath31 .",
    "but the figure prominently shows that for @xmath36 and for small @xmath4 , the mobility decreases instead of increasing with temperature .",
    "this in itself is a novel feature .",
    "the above mentioned features result from a subtle combined effect of the periodic space dependent friction and the periodic potential in the presence of a constant applied force .",
    "the effect can be observed only when there is a phase difference between the potential and the frictional profile ; the phase difference makes the mobility asymmetric with respect to the reversal of the field @xmath2 .",
    "the mobility shows many other interesting features as a function of other parameters , @xmath43 and @xmath1 .",
    "we observe the occurrence of stochastic resonance in the the mobility of an overdamped brownian particle in a sinusoidal potential tilted by a constant force and subjected to a gaussian white noise but , of course , in an inhomogeneous system with space - dependent friction coefficient .",
    "thus the time dependent external oscillating field , which is generally considered as an essential ingredient for the observability of sr can be replaced by a constant force field concomitant with a space - dependent(periodic ) friction coefficient of a spatially extended periodic system .",
    "we would like to point out here that the correct high friction langevin equation in the space dependent frictional medium involves a multiplicative noise along with a temperature drift term @xcite .",
