    "the anyon exciton model ( aem ) , which considers a neutral exciton made up of a valence hole and several fractionally - charged quasielectrons with fractional statistics ( anyons ) , was proposed a decade ago by rashba and portnoi.@xcite it was later developed @xcite to model incompressible quantum liquids ( iqls ) with filling factors and @xmath1 , and is valid at large separation between the hole and the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , so that the coulomb field of the hole does not destroy the iql .",
    "the aem was motivated by experiments on intrinsic photoluminescence ( pl ) in the fractional quantum hall regime @xcite that showed a pronounced double - peak structure in emission spectra , and it has provided major insights into the role of electron - hole separation in determining the optical spectra . the model yields multiple - branch energy spectra and gives a full classification of states for a four - particle system .",
    "it also predicts an increase in ground - state angular momentum and flattening of the corresponding dispersion curve with increasing layer separation .",
    "the aem has also shown good agreement for intermediate electron - hole separation with numerical finite - size calculations by apalkov _",
    "@xcite    at the time when the model was proposed , most experiments on intrinsic pl were carried out at constant carrier density , with the filling factor changed by varying the magnetic field . however , the aem is valid for fixed fractional filling factors only .",
    "more recent experimental techniques enable the 2deg density in the pl experiments to be changed using applied gate voltages @xcite or by varying the light intensity.@xcite thus , it is now possible to manipulate the effective electron - hole separation ( in units of magnetic length ) while keeping the filling factor constant .",
    "so far , charged excitons have been observed for small electron - hole separation , but for large separations it is predicted that neutral anyon excitons should be observed .",
    "these recent developments have rekindled our interest in the theoretical treatment of spatially - separated electron - hole systems . in this paper",
    "we address some important mathematical features of the aem . in sec .",
    "[ s : one ] we derive a general few - particle wavefunction for a neutral exciton consisting of a valence hole and @xmath0 anyons . in sec .",
    "[ s : two ] we move to consider interaction matrix elements for a six - particle anyon exciton , which should be useful for analysis of intrinsic pl experiments at .",
    "( note that there has been some debate as to whether the ground state at is actually an iql - see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein . ) in the last section ,",
    "exact results for the general -particle case are obtained and discussed .",
    "it is shown that the exciton remains bound even at large separations between the 2deg and the hole .",
    "we consider an exciton consisting of a valence hole with charge @xmath2 and @xmath0 anyons with charge @xmath3 and statistical factor @xmath4 .",
    "the hole and anyons reside in two different layers , separated by a distance of @xmath5 magnetic lengths , and are subject to a magnetic field perpendicular to their planes of confinement .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we shall assume that the hole and the quasielectrons are in their corresponding lowest landau levels .    to simplify the description of the exciton",
    ", the hole and anyons may be considered as moving in the same plane with coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and the the layer separation @xmath5 can be introduced later when considering the anyon - hole interaction .",
    "an exciton consisting of a hole and @xmath0 anyons , all in the lowest landau level , will have a total of degrees of freedom . as the exciton is neutral , we can assign it an in - plane momentum @xmath8 , which absorbs two of these degrees of freedom . for the exciton will have _ internal _ degrees of freedom , which results in internal quantum numbers and a multiple - branch energy spectrum .      at this stage",
    "we consider the particles as non - interacting and introduce interactions later as necessary .",
    "we can therefore write the -particle hamiltonian as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the hole and anyon charges , respectively .    choosing the symmetric gauge @xmath12,\\ ] ] and scaling all distances with the magnetic length , we obtain @xmath13\\right)^2+\\sum_{j=1}^n\\:\\frac{1}{2m_a } \\left(\\frac{1}{i}\\nabla_j+\\frac{1}{n}\\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{z } } \\times\\mathbf{r}_j\\right]\\right)^2,\\ ] ] where , as usual , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the dielectric constant are assumed equal to unity .",
    "we now introduce the following new coordinates ( see fig .  [ coords ] ) : @xmath17 together with the complex coordinates .",
    "note also the following constraint on these coordinates : @xmath18        the fact that the variables @xmath19 are not independent means that derivatives with respect to these variables are not defined .",
    "however , it is possible to introduce the derivatives @xmath20 , which treat the variables @xmath19 as if they were independent,@xcite by working in a space of higher dimensionality and then considering a submanifold in this space defined by constraint .    using the chain rule",
    ", we may now rewrite the derivatives of a function @xmath21 with respect to @xmath7 as @xmath22    the old coordinates can be expressed in terms of the new ones as follows : @xmath23 and the corresponding derivatives as @xmath24 we now write the hamiltonian in terms of the new variables . using eqs .",

    ", the possible symmetric polynomials of degree four are constructed from @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "there are two further problems .",
    "the first is to determine the number of possible products of elementary symmetric polynomials for a total degree @xmath55 .",
    "the second is to determine the structure of these products .    to calculate the number of linearly - independent symmetric basis polynomials of degree @xmath55 which may be constructed from the elementary symmetric polynomials we use a result from the theory of partitions.@xcite    the number of ways of partitioning a number @xmath55 into parts of size is given by the coefficient of @xmath64 in the expansion of @xmath65 where each term in the product is known as a _",
    "generating function_. the number of ways of partitioning increases rapidly with @xmath55 and does not follow any pattern .",
    "furthermore , the different products of elementary symmetric polynomials for a particular value of @xmath55 must be determined by hand . an approximate formula for calculating the number of ways of partitioning a number",
    "does exist , the so - called hardy - ramanujan formula,@xcite but it is not applicable to the present case as we have no polynomial of order one due to constraint .",
    "this constraint significantly reduces the number of possible symmetric polynomials by removing the first factor in the product . for example , for the number of polynomials of degree @xmath55 is equal to the integer part of for even @xmath55 and the integer part of for odd @xmath55 , which corresponds to the result obtained in ref .  .      the key difference between the current general formulation and that outlined in ref .",
    "for the four - particle case is the replacement of anyon difference coordinates @xmath66 by the new coordinates @xmath52 .",
    "the principal advantage of the difference coordinates was that they simplified the calculation of inter - anyon repulsion matrix elements , as well as the form of the statistical factor in the exciton wavefunction .",
    "however , they had the disadvantage that the classification of symmetric polynomials was more difficult , as it was necessary to introduce a vandermonde determinant for odd-@xmath55 polynomials .",
    "for example , in the simplest case , even though the number of anyon coordinates is the same in both formulations , we have in terms of difference coordinates , whereas we have a simple product in terms of the new coordinates . for a number of anyons greater than three",
    "this disadvantage is crucial , as the classification of polynomials in terms of @xmath66 becomes too cumbersome and the number of constraints on these coordinates is greater than one .",
    "we introduce an anyon exciton consisting of a hole and five anyons with charge @xmath67 .",
    "we also make a boson approximation so that the statistical factor .",
    "our justification for this step is as follows .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "that for large values of @xmath5 ( which is required for the aem to be valid ) the statistical factor @xmath4 becomes unimportant , and the results for were very similar to those for .",
    "we would therefore also expect this to be true for , as this is even closer to zero . from now on",
    "we consider a boson approximation for anyon statistics .",
    "the explicit form of the exciton basis functions is @xmath68/2-(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}-\\mathbf{d})^2/4\\right\\ } p_{l , m}({\\bar{\\zeta}}_1,\\ldots,{\\bar{\\zeta}}_5)\\prod_{j=1}^5 \\exp\\left\\{-|\\zeta_j|^2/20\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 enumerates different linearly - independent symmetric polynomials of degree @xmath55 .    to construct the symmetric polynomials",
