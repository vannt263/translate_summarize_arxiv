    "combining infrared and radio surveys provides a powerful approach to identifying specific classes of objects ( i.e. , h  ii regions , ultra - compact [ uc ] h  ii regions , planetary nebulae [ pne ] , and oh masers associated with star formation ) based on the simultaneous presence of the cold molecular and dust phases and hot ionized gas ( white , becker & helfand 1991 ; becker et al . 1994 ; szymczak et al . 2002 ) . in a recent paper ( giveon et al .",
    "2005 ; hereafter paper i ) , we have matched a 5 ghz vla survey of the first quadrant of the galactic plane with the msx6c catalog ( egan , price , & kramer 2003 ) to construct a large sample of compact h  ii regions .    in this work we utilize a new vla galactic plane catalog at 1.4 ghz in conjunction with the msx6c galactic plane catalog to complement the 5 ghz catalog , which covers only a narrow @xmath9 strip along 52 degrees of the galactic plane .",
    "the 1.4 ghz catalog covers a much larger area , both in latitude and longitude , and allows a better understanding of the spatial distribution of thermal sources . in  [ 6 cm ]",
    "the new radio catalog is briefly introduced . in  [ iradio ]",
    "we describe the matching of the 1.4 ghz radio catalog with the msx6c catalog , and in  [ properties ] we study the spatial and infrared - color properties of the resulting subset of sources . in  [ conc ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the original 1.4 ghz observations , described in detail in zoonematkermani et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , cover the inner galaxy ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 with @xmath2 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath5 ) with a resolution of @xmath10 and sensitivity of @xmath11 mjy .",
    "most of the original observations were taken in the vla b configuration , with the southernmost fields observed in the a / b configuration .",
    "we applied improved phase calibration and reduction procedures , resulting in an increase in the number of sources detected by more than a factor of three from 1992 sources to 7051 .",
    "the principal improvement resulted from mosaicing areas of overlapping coverage which improved map sensitivity , particularly at the edges of the vla primary beam .",
    "the new 1.4 ghz catalog , to be published separately ( white , becker , & helfand 2005 ) , serves as the primary radio catalog for our comparison with the msx6c catalog .",
    "the improved reduction increased significantly the effective sensitivity of the 1.4 ghz catalog ; it is now @xmath12 complete for sources with @xmath13 mjy , compared to 75% completeness for 25 mjy sources in the earlier version . adopting stellar fluxes from sternberg , hoffmann , & pauldrach ( 2003 )",
    ", we calculate that this allows us to detect at the far edge of the galaxy ( distance of 20 kpc ) a b0 star with an ionization bounded nebula that is optically thin to free - free emission ( @xmath14 mjy ) .",
    "however , the completeness level drops significantly even for the hottest o stars if the nebula is optically thick . for the extreme emission measures of uc h  ii regions ( @xmath15 pc@xmath16@xmath17 ) ,",
    "our sample is only @xmath18 complete for detecting stars as late as o5 .",
    "expected radio and infrared flux densities for the hottest main sequence stars are listed in table [ spec_type ] .",
    "infrared flux densities were calculated assuming 1% of the total luminosity is reradiated in the msx 8 @xmath19 m band ( based on the iras 12 @xmath19 m band response stated by wood & churchwell [ 1989 ] and on the msx 8 @xmath19 m band response function ) .",
    "the emission measure we used for the optically thick case corresponds in the most extreme case to a nebular gas density of @xmath20 @xmath21 and a nebular diameter of 0.003 pc ( e.g. , martn - hernndez , van der hulst , & tielens 2003 ; olmi & cesaroni 1999 ) . for comparison ,",
    "our 5 ghz survey ( paper i , table 1 ) allows the detection of @xmath12 of the most dense and compact cases , because the nebulae are relatively less optically thick for higher radio frequencies , and because the survey itself is deeper .",

    "the msx6c coverage is not uniform over the galactic plane for @xmath22 owing to varying scan overlap resulting from a change in the scan rate at the end of the mission ( egan , price , & kramer 2003 ) .",
    "we match the 1.4 ghz catalog and the msx6c catalog by considering two criteria : @xmath24 - a conservative matching radius of @xmath25 , and @xmath26 - an additional annulus with @xmath27 ; adding this larger annulus still yields real matches .",

    "since the reliabilities are comparable , the multiplicity implies two or more peaks in the radio emission which are unresolved in the infrared by the coarser spatial resolution of the msx6c catalog .    from the matching subset of 582 single radio sources , 266 fall within the area covered by the 5 ghz survey ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) . in paper",
    "i we mention that there are 228 msx6c-5 ghz matches that also have entries in the 1.4 ghz catalog .",

    "it turns out that 5 of these 21 sources are located in fields with degraded sensitivity at 5 ghz ( out of which 3 are known h  ii regions - one source has in fact a 5 ghz counterpart that was not included in the catalog - 12.68430 - 0.18242 ) .",
    "using the rms noise levels from the 5 ghz fields of the other 16 sources gives upper limits on their radio spectral slopes , and all of them show values @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this implies that , in spite the fact that they are high - reliability infrared emitters , they are probably non - thermal sources . indeed , 13 out of the 16 were previously identified as oh masers ( by e.g. , becker , white , & proctor 1992 ; blommaert , van langevelde , & michiels 1994 ; sevenster et al .",

    "we now investigate the infrared colors of the 556 radio sources with highly reliable msx6c counterparts .",
    "lumsden et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show with an earlier version of the msx galactic plane catalog ( msx5c ) that there are two underlying populations distinguished by their infrared colors .",
    "one population shows red infrared colors , and is nebular in nature  h  ii regions , pne , methanol masers without radio emission , and young stellar objects .",
    "lumsden et al . have shown that these objects are heavily embedded sources , in which the infrared colors are determined mainly by the opacity and temperature of the dust surrounding them and not by the direct photospheric contribution of the central exciting star .",
    "the other population shows bluer colors , and consists mainly of evolved stars .",
    "lumsden et al . based this result on detections of previously classified sources . in the left panels of figure [ radio_cc ] we plot two color - color diagrams for our sample of the msx6c-1.4 ghz matches following lumsden et al . for comparison ,",
    "we plot in the right panels all the msx6c sources with high - quality flags detected in the corresponding bands in the area covered by the radio survey ( quality flag criterion as in lumsden et al . ) .",
    "this plot is slightly different from the parallel plot in lumsden et al . which includes only sources in a narrow longitude range ( @xmath43 ) , and in a broader latitude range ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "matching the 1.4 ghz and msx6c catalogs filters out the majority blue population , leaving mostly red - population sources .",
    "for example , there are very few msx6c-1.4 ghz matches with both @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( upper panels ) or with @xmath46 ( lower panels ) .",
    "this result implies that our subset of matching sources consists mostly of h  ii regions and pne , since these two populations are the dominant radio emitters in the galaxy .",
    "however , we can not distinguish the infrared colors of these two populations . from our subset of 556 sources ,",
    "47 were identified as pne by white , becker , & helfand ( 1991 ) and becker et al .",
    "( 1994 ) by matching the older versions of the 1.4 ghz and the 5 ghz maps with the iras catalog , and using the iras color criteria . of these 47 , 21 were `` candidates '' because only limits on their infrared flux densities were available . by considering the increase in source detection in the present version of the 1.4 ghz maps and assuming a constant pne fraction",
    ", we estimate that there are @xmath47 pne in our sample ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this fraction of the matching subset is much larger than the @xmath49 stated in paper i for the msx6c-5 ghz matching , owing to the fact that the 1.4 ghz map covers a much broader area around @xmath50 , including an increasing fraction of pne whose distribution is more latitude - independent . in the following sections we show results that still support the argument that the matching subset is dominated by h  ii regions",
    ".    the broader latitude strip along @xmath51 allows us to investigate whether color varies with latitude .",
    "figure [ lat_cc ] shows the msx6c-1.4 ghz matches in that area divided into lower - latitude ( @xmath52 ) and higher - latitude ( @xmath53 ) bins .",
    "the average flux ratios of the two latitude bins are consistent with each other , except for @xmath54 : @xmath55 for the lower - latitude bin and @xmath56 for the higher - latitude bin .",
    "this may indicate a difference in the ratio of the [ neii]12.8@xmath19 m and the [ neiii]15.6@xmath19 m forbidden lines within the 12@xmath19 m and the 14@xmath19 m bands , respectively , which is proportional to the relative nebular ionization . hence , higher @xmath54 on average , means higher relative ionization .",
    "this flux ratio has smaller spread for lower - latitude sources : @xmath57 compared to 8% for the higher - latitude sources .",
    "this may reflect differences in the source populations : the youngest objects ( mainly compact h  ii regions ) , which are completely embedded in their natal dust cocoons , are more confined to the galactic plane and have a tighter relation between their mid - infrared colors which mainly reflects the dust surrounding them ; higher latitude sources may be a mixture of populations , including older h  ii regions ( and pne ) , which already have part of their ionized gas unobscured with greater contributions of emission lines to the bands fluxes .",
    "a spread in the relative strengths of these lines , reflecting a spread in nebular ionization , will also spread out the color - color distribution .",
    "previous identifications of some of the sources support this picture . using the simbad database with a matching radius of @xmath58 , we find that 145 sources out of the subset of 556 are identified as h  ii regions , while 35 are identified as pne . for the lower - latitude sources , we find that 90% of the identifications are h  ii regions and only 10% are pne , while for the higher - latitude sources , the fraction of the h  ii regions goes down to 60% , with pne contributing 40% .      in figures [ coords_b_20 cm ] and [ coords_l_20 cm ]",
    "we show the distribution in galactic coordinates of the 556 radio sources with msx6c counterparts . the latitude and",
    "longitude histograms are normalized using our survey coverage map ( white , becker , & helfand 2005 ) to correct for uneven coverage due to varying noise levels in the maps .",
    "the coverage was summed up as a function of flux density , and each flux density bin was assigned the corresponding coverage area ( assuming that the flux density distribution is the same over the entire area covered ) .",
    "the raw latitude and longitude bins were then divided by the corresponding coverage area bin , with the underlying assumption that latitude and longitude are independent of each other in each bin .    in figure [ coords_b_20 cm ]",
    "we show latitude histograms for five longitude bins , since there is no sense in integrating the latitude distribution over the entire longitude range , in which different parts may have completely different spatial properties .",
    "the 1.4 ghz sources detected in the infrared show a narrow latitude distribution along the galactic plane , with a fwhm of only @xmath6 , depending on longitude , up to @xmath8 ( see table [ bdist ] ) . for a distance of 8.5 kpc to the galactic center",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath7 pc . even in its narrowest part , the width of the latitude distribution of the matching subset is larger than that of the 5 ghz catalog ( @xmath59 ; paper i ) , probably because the 1.4 ghz has poorer sensitivity , increasing the fraction of closer b stars , which have a broader distribution relative to the more distant , faint o stars detectable at 5 ghz .",
    "table [ bdist ] lists the means , widths , and peak heights of the latitude distributions as a function of longitude .",

    "1995 ) , as is also illustrated in figure [ coords_lb_20 cm ] , and was shown for the distribution of msx6c-5 ghz matches in paper i.    figure [ coords_l_20 cm ] shows the longitude distribution for lower - latitude ( @xmath63 ) and for higher - latitude ( @xmath64 ) sources , for which the coverage map is nearly uniform . for lower - latitude sources ,",
    "the number of matching sources drops off significantly at @xmath8 and almost completely vanishes @xmath65 , while for higher - latitude sources , the longitude distribution is much flatter .",
    "figure [ coords_lb_20 cm ] shows the two - dimensional distribution .",
    "the overall spatial picture is that the population of matches drops off significantly at @xmath8 , and @xmath66 . at @xmath67",
    "the width of the latitude distribution merely reflects the width of the coverage map .",
    "this behavior implies that the matching sample is dominated by population i sources .",
    "since the infrared colors of these sources imply that they are embedded sources , we argue that they are predominantly young compact h  ii regions .",
    "there is a latitude - independent component in the distribution , which can be attributed to the pne population and/or extragalactic contamination .",
    "these populations should have a uniform latitude distribution in the survey area .",
    "we estimate their contribution to be @xmath68 of the sample - consistent with our estimate from  [ rad_ir ] .",
    "we use the average of the deconvolved major and minor axes of the 1.4 ghz sources as a measure of their sizes .",
    "the fwhm of the synthesized beam in the vla b configuration is typically @xmath69 . the north - south elongation increases with decreasing longitude , and for sources at the southern declination limit it reaches @xmath70 .",
    "we compare the size distribution of the 1.4 ghz sources with msx6c matches to the distribution of non - msx6c sources . on average ,",
    "the infrared - detected sources have larger sizes : @xmath71 ( median of 7.1  ) compared to @xmath72 ( median of @xmath73 ) .",
    "the two subsets also show different average major axis to minor axis ratios : @xmath74 ( median of 1.7 ) and @xmath75 ( median of 2.2 ) , respectively . however on average ,",
    "the non - msx6c subset is fainter at 1.4 ghz : the matching subset have average peak flux density @xmath76 mjy ( median of 29 mjy ) and the non - msx6c have average of @xmath77 mjy ( median of 11.0 mjy ) .",
    "this likely arises from a larger extragalactic component for the non - msx subset which we would expect to be dominated by faint point sources along with some radio doubles ( elongated sources with high major - to - minor - axis ratios ) at the brighter end .",
    "there is also a significant contribution at the faint end from side - lobes . while the matching with the msx6c catalog filters out these sources , the non - msx subset may suffer from this effect .    in figure",
    "[ sizes ] we show a histograms of the size distribution of our 1.4 ghz sources and of the subset of msx6c-1.4 ghz matches .    the first bin ( size @xmath78 )",
    "consists of unresolved sources .",
    "this plot shows clearly that extended 1.4 ghz sources are more likely to have msx6c counterparts .",
    "the structure of the 1.4 ghz coverage map allows us to check whether sizes depend on latitude .",
    "figure [ bsizes ] shows the 1.4 ghz sizes as a function of the absolute values of latitude .",
    "higher - latitude sources have significantly smaller sizes .",
    "lower and higher - latitude sources do not have significantly different average major axis to minor axis ratios : @xmath79 ( median of 1.6 ) and @xmath80 ( median of 1.8 ) , respectively . however on average , lower - latitude sources are brighter at 1.4 ghz , with average peak flux density of @xmath81 mjy ( median of 33 mjy ) compared to @xmath82 mjy ( median of 24 mjy ) for the higher - latitude sources .",
    "the infrared flux densities of the two latitude bins are consistent with each other .",
    "we have presented results from matching 1.4 ghz and msx6c source catalogs of the galaxy s first and second quadrants .",
    "the subset of matches extracted supplements the 5 ghz catalog of uc hii regions , which covers only the first galactic quadrant , to give the most sensitive , high - resolution catalog of its kind to date .",
    "the completeness for detecting embedded o stars at 1.4 ghz is @xmath83 , depending on the optical depth of the nebulae to free - free emission .",
    "we have investigated the infrared colors , the spatial distributions , and the morphologies of sources in this catalog .",
    "our main findings are :    * the subset of 1.4 ghz sources with msx6c colors is tightly confined to the galactic plane ( fwhm of @xmath84 or @xmath7 pc ) .",
    "this suggests that the sample is dominated by population i objects . *",
    "the number of msx6c-1.4 ghz matches drops off sharply and the latitude distribution flattens out significantly at @xmath67 . * by matching our 1.4 ghz radio catalog and the msx6c catalog , most of the blue msx population is filtered out ; the majority of the matching subset belongs to the red msx population implying embedded sources .",
    "our 1.4 ghz radio catalog and msx6c infrared data can not distinguish h  ii regions from pne .    the comprehensive compilation from the literature by paladini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) lists 765 known hii regions in our survey area , only 90 of which are smaller than @xmath85 in diameter ( at 2.7 ghz ) ; thus , the matching subset described in this paper represents a 6-fold increase in the number of compact and ultra - compact hii regions in this region .",
