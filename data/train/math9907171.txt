    "the concept of quantization has a long history .",
    "mathematically , it originated from hermann weyl  @xcite , who introduced a mapping from classical observables  functions on the phase space @xmath0  to quantum observables  operators in the hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "the idea was to express functions on @xmath0 as fourier transforms and to replace the exponential kernel  the one - dimensional representation of the heisenberg group  by the corresponding unitary group element in the von neumann infinite - dimensional representation of the heisenberg group , parameterized by the planck constant @xmath2 .",
    "the inverse mapping was constructed by e.  winger  @xcite by interpreting classical observables as symbols of operators .",
    "later on , moyal  @xcite and groenewold  @xcite have shown that the symbol of the commutator or of the product of operators is the sine ( respectively , exponential ) function of the bidifferential operator of the poisson bracket applied to the corresponding symbols .    in the early 70 s",
    ", berezin was developing the general mathematical definition of quantization as a kind of a functor from the category of classical mechanics to a certain category of associative algebras  @xcite .",
    "in particular , he considered quantization on khler manifolds .",
    "berezin s approach was analytic in nature and it required very restrictive geometric conditions on the underlying khler structure  @xcite . as a result , the only meaningful examples established in  @xcite were @xmath3 and homogeneous bounded domains in @xmath3 .",
    "later on , berezin s approach and its relation with geometric quantization were developed in  @xcite . only recently in  @xcite a.  karabegov , using local operator - type constructions , has proved that on an arbitrary khler manifold there exists a special deformation quantization ( with `` separation of variables '' ) which is local and is parameterized by an arbitrary formal deformation of the khler potential .",
    "about the same time as berezin , bayen , flato , fronsdal , lichnerowicz and sternheimer  @xcite considered quantization as a deformation of the usual commutative product of classical observables into a noncommutative associative product @xmath4 which is parameterized by the planck constant @xmath2 and satisfies the correspondence principle . in",
    "@xcite they systematically developed the concept of deformation quantization as a theory of @xmath5 - products and gave an independent formulation of quantum mechanics based on this notion .",
    "the bffls approach was inspired by the work of vey  @xcite on the deformation of poisson structures , where the idea of the @xmath5 - product had already appeared .",
    "subsequently , the work  @xcite laid a foundation for the deformation quantization , a theory that utilizes pure algebraic approach based on hochschild cohomology to the deformation of associative algebras , developed by gerstenhaber  @xcite , together with the chevalley - eilenberg cohomology of the poisson - lie algebra of classical observables .",
    "because of its physical origin and motivation , the problem of deformation quantization was first considered for symplectic manifolds .",
    "first results in this direction were theorems by vey  @xcite and neroslavsky and vlasov  @xcite that deformations of the poisson - lie algebra and of the commutative algebra of classical observables exist whenever the third betti number of a symplectic manifold vanishes .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that for any symplectic manifold there exists a fourth order quantization .",
    "finally , the problem of existence and classification of @xmath5 - products on arbitrary symplectic manifolds was solved by de wilde - lecomte  @xcite .",
    "another approach was taken in  @xcite and fedosov  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite a rather explicit construction of the @xmath5 - product was given .",
    "the problem of deformation quantization is naturally formulated for the poisson manifolds as well . until recently ,",
    "the best known example of such quantization was the etinhof - kazhdan theorem  @xcite that every poisson - lie group can be quantized .",
    "the situation changed when m.  kontsevich proved  @xcite his famous formality conjecture , which , in particular , implies that deformation quantization exists on every poisson manifold .",
    "in addition to this general result , kontsevich presented a universal formula for the deformation quantization of an arbitrary poisson structure on @xmath6 .",
    "this remarkable formula gives a @xmath5 - product of smooth functions on @xmath6 as formal power series in @xmath2 of bidifferential operators parameterized by graphs , with coefficients given by integrals over certain configuration spaces .",
    "as was stated in  @xcite , this series resembles a perturbation expansion of the topological sigma - model of b type ( after a suitable supersymmetry transformation ) .",
    "recently , this perturbation expansion was carried through in  @xcite .",
    "the present paper appeared from an attempt to understand further the analogy with the perturbation expansion .",
    "specifically , we observe that there exists a simple integral formula for the deformation quantization on khler manifolds based on the finite - dimensional formal integral , defined through the laplace method approximation .",
    "quite naturally , coefficients of the corresponding formal power series can be written in terms of  feynman graphs \" .",
    "remarkably , the integral that we consider is almost identical to the one used by berezin  @xcite .",
    "the difference , however , is that now we regard it as a formal power series in the deformation parameter @xmath2 , and our approach works for an arbitrary khler manifold , whereas berezin was considering a @xmath5 - product given by a convergent integral in some complex domain . as the result",
    ", he was forced to impose certain global restrictions on the khler manifold , which make his approach meaningful only for @xmath3 with the standard khler structure and for flag varieties , as discussed in  @xcite ( and in  @xcite for generalized flag varieties ) . in comparison",
    ", our approach gives a direct proof of the theorem proved by karabegov  @xcite in terms of berezin s original integral .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section   2",
    "we recall some basic facts from berezin s paper  @xcite . in the next section",
    "we construct the non - normalized @xmath5 - product : deformed product for khler manifolds , given by a simple ( formal ) integral formula , which does not preserve the unit element of the commutative algebra of classical observables . in section  4",
    "we present the normalized @xmath5 - product , which preserves the unit element , and show that there exists formal bergman kernel . in the appendix",
    ", we prove the equality between two types of the formal integrals introduced in the paper .",
    "consider a complex manifold @xmath3 endowed with a khler metric @xmath7 since @xmath3 is a two - connected stein manifold , every khler metric on it admits a global potential @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 where we are using complex coordinates @xmath10 , on @xmath3 .",

    "to consider the family of associative algebras @xmath72 as a quantization of the poisson algebra of classical observables @xmath12 , the `` correspondence principle '' @xmath73 should be valid for `` suitable '' continuous families @xmath74 , where in the right - hand side @xmath75 .    in order to verify   and to introduce these families of symbols , berezin  @xcite made several assumptions .",

    "the exponential factor in integral   has a critical point at @xmath38 , so that the laplace method is applicable ( for smooth functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) , provided that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath82 as @xmath83 is also known . in  @xcite , berezin did not consider this problem , which we address and solve in section 4 .",
    "instead , berezin made the second assumption ( hypothesis a - d in  @xcite ) , that @xmath84 for all @xmath85 .",
    "this condition is very restrictive .",
    "it implies ( see  @xcite , theorem 2.5 ) that @xmath86 is harmonic , so that berezin s quantization works only for very special khler manifolds , essentially , for the flag varieties and their generalizations .",
    "the corresponding construction depends on a particular choice of the khler potential and is coordinate dependent .",

    "therefore , the @xmath5 - product   is not suitable for the deformation quantization of a complex poisson structure on @xmath3  the problem solved by kontsevich for arbitrary poisson structures on @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "still , we believe that our approach can be successfully applied to the problem of deformation quantization of arbitrary complex poisson structure on @xmath3 , if it is modified in the spirit of the supersymmetric approach to the duistermaat - heckman localization formula ( see , i.e. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , consider representation   for the non - normalized @xmath102 - product in the remark  [ fermions ] , and notice that the `` action '' @xmath257 is not invariant under the supersymmetry transformation .",
    "introduction of the unit into the normalized @xmath5 - product   modifies the action in a way that cancels `` vacuum diagrams '' , but still it does not restore the supersymmetry .",
    "we conjecture that the supersymmetric action can be obtained by an appropriate deformation @xmath258 of the khler metric . then , according to the paradigm of the supersymmetric quantum field theory , the corresponding feynman diagrams will contain no loops and will depend only on the poisson tensor and its derivatives",
    ".      here we will show that the unit element @xmath242 can be interpreted as the kernel of a projection operator .",
    "specifically , for any @xmath238 define the following formal integral @xmath259 as the formal asymptotic expansion around the point @xmath38 obtained by repeated `` integration by parts '' .",
    "namely , applying stokes formula @xmath171 times , reduce the integration of @xmath260-form @xmath261 over the @xmath262-chain  direct product of @xmath171 annuli centered at @xmath263 to the integral of @xmath264-form over the @xmath171-cycle  direct product of @xmath171 circles of radii @xmath106 around @xmath265 , and iterate this procedure .",
    "the term - by - term evaluation of the limit @xmath266 results in a power series expansion in @xmath2 ( see appendix for more details ) .",
    "equivalently , the formal integral @xmath267 can be defined as the asymptotic of the distribution @xmath268 as @xmath269 .",
    "this procedure is well - defined , since @xmath270 and the matrix @xmath271 is non - degenerate .",
    "coefficients of this power series expansion in @xmath2 are given by infinite sums , convergent only when function @xmath41 and khler potential @xmath208 are real - analytic .",
    "in the @xmath24-category , these coefficients should be interpreted as infinite jets . by @xmath200$]-linearity",
    ", @xmath272 extends to the linear mapping @xmath273\\rightarrow { \\mathcal{j}}[[\\hbar]]$ ] , where @xmath274 , where @xmath274 is the space of global sections of the bundle of formal ( with respect to @xmath2 ) infinite jets over @xmath3 .",
    "the mapping @xmath272 takes values @xmath275  the space of global sections of of the bundle of formal holomorphic jets over @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear that in the real - analytic category the integral ( [ oint ] ) , when it converges , is a holomorphic function .",
    "for the asymptotics of the integral , this is an algebraic property of coefficients .",
    "therefore , the same is true for the formal power series with the coefficients in infinite jets in the @xmath24-category .",
    "operator @xmath272 is a projector , @xmath276 .",
    "this follows from the identity between two types of formal integrals @xmath277 where @xmath278 , proved in appendix .",
    "namely , for @xmath279 and @xmath280 set @xmath281 . using the property of the unit and that @xmath282 is holomorphic in @xmath43 , we get @xmath283      here we define the formal analog of the mapping @xmath69 from contravariant to covariant symbols as the following formal integral @xmath284 by @xmath200$]-linearity , it extends to the linear operator @xmath285\\rightarrow{\\mathcal{a}}[[\\hbar]]$ ] with the property @xmath286 where @xmath287 .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath69 is invertible .",
    "define the @xmath5-product of contravariant symbols as in  , @xmath288 which , of course , is equivalent to the @xmath5-product of covariant symbols .    define a formal berezin - toeplitz operator @xmath289\\rightarrow{\\mathcal{j}}_{hol}[[\\hbar]]$ ] with contravariant symbol @xmath290 $ ] as follows : @xmath291 for all @xmath292 $ ] .",

    ", we have @xmath296 where @xmath297 .",
    "the same arguments also show that @xmath298 and the statement follows .",
    "some interesting explicit formulas for the asymptotic expansion of the bergman kernel on @xmath46 , as well as for the coefficients of the product @xmath299 , were derived in  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that in  @xcite the deformation quantization appeared as a part of m - theory in the string theory .      for many inspiring discussions we are greatly indebted to m. flato , who passed away in november 1998 .",
    "we also would like to thank m.  kontsevich , s.  shatashvili and d.  sternheimer for helpful discussions , w.  taylor for bringing  @xcite to our attention , and a. kogan for the help with the figures . the work of n.r . and",
    "was partially supported by the nsf grants dms-97 - 09594 and dms-95 - 00557 respectively .",
    "here we will prove the following statement .",
    "( equality of two types of formal integrals ) @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the calabi function of the khler form and @xmath302 here the formal integral in the left hand side is understood as the formal laplace expansion around the critical point @xmath38 of the exponential factor , i.e. , as the asymptotic of the distribution @xmath303 as @xmath269 .",
    "the formal integral in the right hand side is understood as the asymptotic of the distribution @xmath304 as @xmath269 .",
    "we will start with case @xmath305 ; the precise definition of the formal integral @xmath267 will become clear in a due course .",
    "first , assume that @xmath306 , that the calabi function has a single critical point at @xmath38 , and , assuming that the integral @xmath307 exists for @xmath308 , consider its the asymptotic behavior as @xmath269 .",
    "replacement of the domain of integration by a neighborhood @xmath309 of @xmath310 ( with certain @xmath311 depending on @xmath41 and @xmath208 in the support of @xmath41 ) will result in an exponentially small error term as @xmath269 .",
    "( it would be also sufficient to consider terms that decay faster than any power @xmath312 with @xmath313 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath314 where the symbol @xmath315 stands for equality modulo exponentially small terms as @xmath269 .    next , for fixed @xmath42",
    ", consider the following representation ( cf  @xcite ) @xmath316 where @xmath317 and satisfies the equation @xmath318 so that @xmath319 applying stokes formula , we get @xmath320 where @xmath321 , and we have used that the integral over the circle of radius @xmath322 around @xmath42 is exponentially small as @xmath269 .    repeating this procedure , we obtain @xmath323 where @xmath324 . finally ,",
    "expanding @xmath325 into power series in @xmath2 with coefficients @xmath326 that have singularities @xmath327 as @xmath328 , and using the generalized cauchy formula @xmath329 which is valid for any @xmath330 , we get an asymptotic expansion for @xmath331 in terms of a power series in @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , the coefficients of this expansion are given by the infinite sums , convergent when the function @xmath41 and khler potential @xmath208 are real - analytic .",
    "this expansion , extended to the formal category ( with respect to @xmath2 ) with coefficients given by the global sections of the bundle of infinite jets over @xmath46 , is the definition of a formal integral @xmath267 .",
