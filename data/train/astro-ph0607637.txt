    "one of the primary quests of observational astronomy is measuring the formation history of structures ranging in scale from individual galaxies to superclusters of galaxies .",
    "however , a serious impediment to this research is the fact that we live in a cosmological backwater .",
    "the local group hosts only two giant spiral galaxies , the milky way and andromeda ( m31 , ngc  224 ) , and no giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "the nearest galaxy groups to our own lie beyond 3 mpc , with the closest ( the maffei group ) being heavily reddened ( karachentsev 2005 ) .    given our rural setting , it is not surprising that our own galaxy drives the textbook picture of a giant spiral galaxy , with an ancient , metal - poor halo ( e.g. , ryan & norris 1991 ; vandenberg 2000 ) , an ancient , metal - rich bulge ( e.g. , zoccali et al .",
    "2003 ; mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) , and a disk hosting a wide range of ages and metallicities ( e.g. , fontaine et al .  2001 ; ibukiyama & arimoto 2002 ) . however , stellar population work in the milky way is often limited by uncertainties in distance and reddening , and it is not even clear that the milky way is representative of giant spiral galaxies in general .",
    "debate continues about the structure of the milky way system , how it formed , and how its various substructures ( halo , bulge , disk , globular clusters , satellites , and tidal debris streams ) formed with respect to one another . physical processes possibly at work in forming the milky way include rapid dissipative collapse in the early universe ( eggen et al .  1962 ) and slower accretion of separate subclumps ( larson 1969 ; searle & zinn 1978 ) .",
    "more recent hierarchical models suggest that spheroids form in a repetitive process during the mergers of galaxies and protogalaxies , while disks form by slow accretion of gas between merging events ( e.g. , white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "although hierarchical models based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) show great success in reproducing the observable universe on scales larger than 1 mpc , these models predict many more dwarf galaxies than are actually seen around the milky way ( moore et al .",
    "this discrepancy implies the existence of other mechanisms at work on small scales .",
    "for example , bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg ( 2000 ) suggested that after the epoch of reionization , photoionization would suppress gas accretion in small subhalos , keeping most of them dark - matter dominated , and that a large fraction of those subhalos that did become dwarf galaxies would be tidally disrupted into the halos of their parent galaxies .",
    "however , grebel & gallagher ( 2004 ) argue that the presence of ancient stars in all dwarf galaxies , along with their wide variety of star formation histories , is evidence against a dominant evolutionary effect from reionization .",
    "furthermore , shetrone et al.(2003 ) demonstrated that chemical differences between nearby dsphs and the galactic halo imply that the halo is not comprised of populations like those of present - day dsphs . whether or not accretion of dwarf galaxies is the dominant source of stars in the halo , it is likely that such galaxies do contribute , and at large galactocentric distances their stars can remain in coherent orbital streams for 1 gyr or more .",
    "the discovery of the sgr dwarf ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) rekindled interest in halo formation through accretion of dwarf galaxies , leading to ambitious programs to map the spatial distribution , kinematics , and chemical abundance in the halos of the milky way ( e.g. , morrison et al .",
    "2000 ; majewski et al .",
    "2000 ) and andromeda ( e.g. , ferguson et al .  2002",
    "; guhathakurta et al .",
    "a spectacular example of this process has been found in andromeda ( ibata et al .",
    "2001 ) , which hosts a giant tidal stream extending several degrees on the sky ( mcconnachie et al .  2003 ) . indeed , the star count map of ferguson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) shows complex substructure throughout andromeda , while also showing evidence for an underlying smooth spheroid extending to large radii .    besides the overabundant satellite problem ,",
    "another issue with hierarchical cdm models is their prediction that gas loses much of its angular momentum during disk formation , resulting in theoretical disks that are much smaller than those observed ( navarro & benz 1991 ) .",
    "some have turned to warm dark matter ( wdm ) cosmologies to alleviate this problem ( e.g. , sommer - larsen & dolgov 2001 ) , but there is an indication that angular momentum remains a problem in these models ( see bullock , kravtsov , & col@xmath1n 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , the solution might lie in the inclusion of supernova feedback from the earliest generation of stars ; recent models that show promise in this area predict that the bulk of the disk population was formed relatively late , at @xmath2 ( thacker & couchman 2001 ; weil , eke , & efstathiou 1998 ) , a prediction supported by panchromatic surveys of large numbers of galaxies ( hammer et al .",
    "2005 ) .    as the nearest giant spiral galaxy to our own",
    ", andromeda offers an essential laboratory for studying the evolution of spiral galaxies .",
    "given our vantage point , one might even argue that it is a better laboratory than our own galaxy . at 770  kpc ( freedman & madore 1990 )",
    ", the stars in andromeda all appear to be at approximately the same distance , and at an inclination of @xmath3 ( de vaucouleurs 1958 ) , its various structures can be studied somewhat independently .",
    "we can resolve andromeda s old main sequence stars with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , while the horizontal branch ( hb ) and upper red giant branch ( rgb ) are accessible to observatories on the ground .",
    "recent years have seen an enormous increase in observing time directed at andromeda , with deep pencil - beam surveys providing its star formation history ( e.g. , brown et al .",
    "2003 ; brown et al .  2006",
    "; stephens et al .  2003 ; olsen et al .",
    "2006 ) and shallow wide - field surveys providing maps of its morphology , metallicity , and kinematics ( e.g. , ibata et al .  2001 ; ibata et al .",
    "2004 ; ibata et al .  2005 ; mcconnachie et al . 2003 ; ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ; ferguson et al .  2005",
    "; kalirai et al .",
    "2006b ; guhathakurta et al .",
    "2005 ) .    at first glance , andromeda and the milky way appear to be very similar ;",
    "both are of similar hubble type , luminosity , mass , and size ( van den bergh 1992 ; van den bergh 2000 ; klypin , zhao , & somerville 2002 ) .",
    "however , we have long known that the andromeda spheroid is very different from that of the milky way .",
    "the first evidence came from mould & kristian ( 1986 ) , who found that the mean metallicity in the m31 halo , at 7 kpc on the minor axis , was surprisingly high ( [ m / h]@xmath4 ) .",
    "pritchet & van den bergh ( 1994 ) subsequently found that the halo surface brightness profile , out to a distance of 20 kpc on the minor axis , follows a de vaucouleurs exp@xmath5 $ ] profile instead of the @xmath6 power law expected for a canonical halo .",
    "these results were extended by reitzel & guhathakurta ( 2002 ) , durrell et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2004 ) , and bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who found that the high metallicity and de vaucouleurs profile continued out to distances of 2030 kpc on the minor axis .",
    "recent surveys began probing m31 over much wider areas and much more deeply .",
    "ferguson et al .  ( 2002 ) mapped the density of bright rgb stars over 25 square degrees of the galaxy , finding significant substructure in the halo and outer disk .",
    "with photometry extending down to the oldest main sequence , brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reconstructed the star formation history in the halo at 11 kpc on the minor axis , and found a wide age distribution , with @xmath030% of the stars at ages of 68 gyr .",
    "all of these studies suggested that the m31 halo is dramatically different than the milky way halo , begging the question `` which is representative of large spiral galaxies ? ''",
    "one possible answer comes from mouhcine et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who found that the metallicities of spiral halos correlate well with their parent galaxy luminosities ; the milky way halo falls well off this metallicity - luminosity relation ( being unusually metal - poor for the parent galaxy mass ) , while the m31 halo appears representative for large spiral galaxies .",
    "it is unclear if this trend is due to a general tendency for more massive galaxies to host a more dominant bulge , ingest more satellites , and/or ingest larger satellites .",
    "recently , two independent groups ( guhathakurta et al .  2005 ; irwin et al .",
    "2005 ) studying the outskirts of m31 found an extended stellar halo that more closely resembles the halo of our own milky way .",
    "this extended halo begins to dominate beyond 30 kpc , where the minor - axis surface - brightness profile transitions from a de vaucouleurs law to an @xmath7 law . from the colors in their photometric sample , irwin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) concluded that the metallicity in the extended halo was as high as it is in the region interior to 30 kpc , but guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , using a spectroscopically - confirmed sample extending 3 times farther out on the minor axis , found that this extended halo is metal poor .",
    "however , the existence of a metallicity gradient was later confirmed by kalirai et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "these discoveries can lead to a confusion of terminology .",
    "it seems straightforward to refer to the inner few kpc as the bulge , and to the stars beyond 30 kpc as the halo , but what about the stars at 530 kpc on the minor axis ? before the discovery of the extended metal - poor halo , this population of metal - rich stars",
    "was generally referred to as the halo , but it is quite possible that this stellar population is more closely related to the bulge .",
    "furthermore , there has been considerable debate about the contribution of disk stars at these radii .",
    "kinematic studies indeed show that m31 has an extended thick disk ( ibata et al .",
    "the minor - axis population at 11 kpc from the center has kinematics that are inconsistent with a rotationally supported disk ( kalirai et al.2006b ; rich et al .  in prep . ) , but the velocity dispersion is smaller than might be expected for a purely pressure - supported stellar system .",
    "because the term `` spheroid '' normally refers to a structure that includes the bulge and halo , we use the term here when referring to the extraplanar stars at 5 - 30 kpc , merely to distinguish from those regions that can be clearly labeled bulge ( within @xmath05 kpc of the nucleus ) , disk ( within @xmath030  kpc on the major axis ) , and halo ( beyond @xmath030  kpc on the minor axis ) .",
    "however , our use of this term is not intended to imply a smooth , relaxed , pressure - supported structure .    to further understand the formation of andromeda , we need to know the star formation histories of its various structures . to that end",
    ", we have now obtained deep _",
    "hst _ images in three fields , located in the inner spheroid , outer disk , and the giant tidal stream .",
    "all of these images reach well below the oldest main sequence turnoff ( msto ) in the galaxy , allowing a reconstruction of the entire star formation history in each field .",
    "keck spectroscopy in each of these fields provides additional kinematic information ( kalirai et al .",
    "2006b ; reitzel et al .",
    "2006 , in prep ; rich et al .",
    "2006 , in prep ) . in previous papers ( brown et al .  2003",
    "; brown et al .  2006 ) we presented the preliminary analysis of the spheroid and stream fields .",
    "in this paper , we present the detailed star formation histories in the spheroid , stream , and outer disk of andromeda . in",
    " [ secobs ] , we describe our observing strategy and the data .",
    "we describe the data reduction in  [ secred ] , followed by the production of the photometric catalogs in  [ secphot ] . in  [ secanal ] , we describe our analysis , which ranges from qualitative inspection of the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to quantitative fitting of the star formation histories , including a full exploration of the possible systematic effects of our assumptions . in  [ secdisc ] , we discuss the implications of our analysis .",
    "the results of our study are summarized in  [ secsumm ] .",
    "using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; ford et al .",

    "surface brightness was the primary driver in field selection .",
    "there are two competing factors in obtaining a cmd appropriate for reconstructing the star formation history .",
    "one wants to maximize the number of stars in the cmd , to minimize contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies , to minimize statistical uncertainties in the characterization of the population , and to allow the detection of subtle cmd features ( e.g. , small bursts due to interaction of andromeda with its satellites ) .",
    "one also wants to minimize the crowding , in order to maximize the accuracy of the photometry for a given exposure time . to explore these competing factors ,",
    "we created realistic simulations of acs images under various population assumptions , and found that the optimal crowding is approximately one star of interest for every 50100 resolution elements ; these results agree well with those of renzini ( 1998 ) .",
    "the native acs / wfc pixel size is 0@xmath14.05 , which is approximately twice the width for critically sampling the point spread function ( psf ) , so the number of resolution elements is roughly the number of pixels .",
    "this translates into @xmath0250,000 stars in an acs image , corresponding to a surface brightness @xmath1526.3  mag per square arcsec , which defines a roughly elliptical isophote around m31 that provides the optimal crowding .",
    "fortuitously , the intersection of this isophote with the southern minor axis falls near a globular cluster ( skhb-312 ) previously imaged with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on _ hst _ ( holland et al .",
    "1997 ) , so the exact position of our spheroid image was chosen to place this cluster at the edge of our field .",
    "holland et al.(1996 ) determined the metallicity distribution in this field , and showed that it was very similar to that observed in other fields throughout the inner spheroid .",
    "although holland et al .  ( 1997 ) reported a 10@xmath14 tidal radius for this cluster , we placed it at the edge of our field in case deeper images revealed a larger extent to the cluster that would contaminate a significant fraction of the image and negatively impact the primary goal of studying the field population .",
    "our photometry of skhb-312 reached well below its msto , revealing a cluster age of 10  gyr ( brown et al.2004b ) .",
    "brown et al .  ( 2004b ) found no evidence for extended tidal tails in the cluster , and so for the current study , we mask the area within 15@xmath14 of the cluster center . in the subsequent observations of the tidal stream and outer disk ,",
    "there was only a candidate globular cluster ( bol d242 ; galleti et al .",
    "2004 ) near our optimal position in the stream , and no known globular clusters near our optimal position in the disk",
    ". the exact location of the stream field was chosen to include this candidate cluster ( which subsequently turned out to be a superposition of foreground stars ) , whereas the exact location of the disk field was chosen to minimize the contribution from the spheroid , based upon the disk / spheroid decomposition of walterbos & kennicutt ( 1988 ) .",
    "the surface brightness in the stream field is @xmath160.5  mag fainter than that in our original spheroid program , while that in the disk field is @xmath160.1  mag brighter than that in our original spheroid program .",
    "the hydrogen column density in the disk field is also much larger than that in the spheroid and stream fields ( see table  [ fieldtab ] for @xmath10 measured at each of our field positions ) .",
    "each exposure in a given bandpass was dithered so that no two exposures placed a star on the same pixel . dithering smooths out sensitivity variations across the detector , fills in the gap between the two halves of the acs / wfc detector , allows optimal sampling of the psf , and enables the removal of hot pixels .",
    "our dither pattern employed three tiers of dithers to optimize the data quality .",
    "the first two tiers determined the nominal field position for one of our visits in a given band ( usually spanning two orbits ) , while the final tier provided a 4-point dither pattern to optimally sample the psf within a visit .",
    "the offsets in the first dither tier moved from -5 to + 10 pixels in x , with steps of 5 pixels , and from + 60 to -120 pixels in y , with steps of 60 pixels , to place the detector gap at four adjacent positions on the sky .",
    "these first - tier offsets produce four horizontal strips in our data where the field is underexposed by 25% ; stars in these strips are ultimately discarded from our catalog , but sampling the sky in the detector gap yields more accurate psf - fitting for the field because we have contiguous photometry for all of the objects in the field .",
    "the offsets in the second dither tier moved -4.5 , 0 , or + 4.5 pixels independently in x and y , to smooth out small - scale variations in detector response , plus a random fractional pixel in x and y , to avoid aliasing effects between the various dithers , the pixel plate scale , and the geometric distortion .",
    "the offsets in the third tier were ( 0,0 ) , ( + 1.5,0 ) , ( + 1.5,+1.5 ) , and ( 0,+1.5 ) pixels in x and y , to sample the psf at twice the frequency provided by a single exposure .",
    "each of these programs obtained brief exposures of galactic star clusters with the same filters on the acs / wfc ( table  [ tabclus ] ; brown et al .",
    "the resulting cmds provide empirical isochrones that can be compared directly to the andromeda cmds and used to calibrate the transformation of theoretical isochrones to the acs bandpasses .",
    "these cluster observations , the empirical isochrones , and the transformation of the theoretical victoria - regina isochrones ( vandenberg , bergbusch , & dowler 2006 ) to the acs bandpasses are fully detailed by brown et al .",
    "we will use these empirical isochrones and theoretical isochrones here , shifted to the andromeda reference frame by assuming a distance of 770  kpc ( freedman & madore 1990 ) and a reddening of @xmath17  mag ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) . over the region defined for fits to the star formation history ,",

    "the velocities in the disk field show it to be dominated ( @xmath27 ) by stars moving in a disk component , with the remainder in the spheroid .",
    "if calibrated data are retrieved from the _ hst _ archive as soon as they are available , they will generally not have the best dark and bias subtractions , because those calibration products are created weeks later from a contemporaneous set of data that was obtained in the days surrounding a given observation .",
    "thus , months after these observations , we re - retrieved the images , yielding data with the latest acs pipeline calibration , including an appropriate dark subtraction , flat - field , and bias correction ; these are the `` flt '' files in the acs pipeline .",
    "we then subtracted an iteratively sigma - clipped median sky level from each quadrant of each image to avoid an unnecessary increase in image noise during the later coaddition of the images ; this also corrects for small quadrant - dependent bias residuals .",
    "we used the pyraf drizzle package ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) to register the individual images , correct for geometric distortion and plate scale variations , reject cosmic rays , and coadd all of the frames in a given bandpass .",
    "the geometric distortion correction employed the coefficients provided by the acs calibration pipeline for each image , which include both the general geometric distortion and also the time - varying plate scale changes due to velocity aberration .",
    "as part of the drizzle process , the images were resampled to a plate scale of 0@xmath14.03 pixel@xmath28 .",
    "residual shifts , rotations , and plate scale variations were corrected as part of our registration process , and thus our reduction is immune to the software errors that have sometimes caused registration and photometry problems in the multidrizzle software ( although note that we do not use multidrizzle in our reduction ) .    to register the images , we drizzled the images to individual output frames that were corrected for geometric distortion and velocity aberration , with relative shifts determined by the pointing information in the image headers ( closely matching our commanded dither pattern ) .",
    "the positions of @xmath010,000 relatively bright stars , well - detected in the individual images , were then measured in each image through the entire image stack , using an iterative fit of a gaussian profile to each star .",
    "these stellar positions were used to refine the offsets ( deviations from the guide star offsets ) , rotations ( deviations from the fixed orientation requested ) , and plate scale changes ( telescope breathing and residual velocity aberration ) . using the refined knowledge of the relative astrometry , we re - drizzled the images to individual output frames .",
    "these refinements to the offsets , rotations , and scales are iterated until the positions of the bright stars in the individual images are aligned to better than 0.01 pixels .",
    "next we created masks of cosmic rays and problematic pixels .",
    "although saturated pixels are masked in the data quality array ( along with some of the hot and dead pixels ) , saturation is only an issue for the handful of bright foreground stars and not stars in m31 ; in our half - orbit exposures , a star would have to be brighter than 20.6  mag in either bandpass and well - centered in a pixel for saturation to occur . to create our masks",
    ", we first calculated a clipped median of all the images in a given band , resulting in our first pass at the deep image in that band .",
    "the first - pass images were then reverse - drizzled ( or `` blotted '' in the drizzle nomenclature ) back to the original frame of the individual images . the comparison of these blotted images with each flt image enabled the creation of masks for the cosmic rays , self - annealed pixels ( oversubtracted by the dark calibration ) , and short - term transient warm and hot pixels not corrected by the contemporaneous dark calibration . to create a complete mask for each frame",
    ", these custom masks were combined with the pipeline - provided data quality masks in which we include all pixels flagged for any reason .",
    "the masked images were then coadded , with weighting by exposure time , to create a second - pass deep image in each band .",
    "because this iteration was significantly improved over the first pass ( median image ) , these second - pass deep images were then blotted back to the original frames of the individual images , to enable refinement of the image masks .",
    "the frames were coadded a third time to create the final image in each bandpass .",
    "we then added a flat sky component to each final image , representing the exposure - weighted mean of the sky background subtracted from the individual frames , to ensure that the counting statistics were appropriate in the subsequent photometric reduction . in figure  [ image ] , we show a false - color @xmath29 subsection of our spheroid field , combining the images in f606w and f814w filters .    although this process was repeated on the full set of data for each field , we also applied the process to a subset of the spheroid data chosen to match the shorter exposure times in the stream and disk . in this paper , the fits to the star formation history in the spheroid utilize the full dataset , but the shallower version of the spheroid data is useful for making a fair comparison of the cmds of the three fields .",
    "spheroid cmds utilizing this subset of the data are labeled `` matched . ''",
    "we used the daophot - ii ( stetson 1987 ) psf - fitting package to obtain photometry of each field .",
    "empirical psfs were created from the images using the most isolated and well - exposed stars , with a radius of 23 pixels ( 0@xmath14.69 ) .",
    "we first performed an initial pass of object detection and aperture photometry .",
    "the resulting object catalog was then clipped to retain only those well - detected stars that fell within the dominant stellar locus in the cmd ( rejecting outliers that are obvious blends and background galaxies ) , while also avoiding those stars near the tip of the rgb and in the instability strip ( which can be variable and thus have psfs adversely affected by the cosmic - ray cleaning ) .",
    "we then screened for stars with relatively bright neighbors ; to be a valid psf star , all neighbors within 15 pixels must be at least 3  mag fainter than the psf star , and all neighbors within 22 pixels must be at least 2  mag fainter than the psf star .",
    "finally , we created a sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) map of the thousands of background galaxies in our image , and removed from our list of psf candidates any star within 23 pixels of an extended object .",
    "we also removed stars within 23 pixels of an image border or a bad pixel ( e.g. , due to charge bleeding from saturated stars ) .",
    "this resulted in @xmath02000 psf candidates per field in the disk and spheroid and @xmath01600 psf candidates in the stream field .",
    "these psf stars were then passed through an iterative process to create the empirical psf for each bandpass in each field . in the first pass",
    ", we used the psf of brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) as an initial guess at the current psf .",
    "we fitted this psf to the catalog of stars , subtracted those stars , and then performed a new round of object detection on the residual image to find the fainter stars uncovered .",
    "we added these stars to the catalog , and repeated the psf - fitting photometry for the entire catalog .",
    "stars neighboring each psf star were then subtracted , and a new psf was then created . during this process , we eliminated psf stars whose fits were high @xmath30 outliers ( as reported by daophot - ii ) .",
    "also psf stars were cut from the list if psf subtraction uncovered close stellar blends with the psf star or revealed underlying deviant pixel artifacts .",
    "using such a large number of psf stars , we are able to compare the morphology of the psf - subtracted residuals to those of nearby psf stars and reject any with morphology deviating from the pattern in that particular region of the image .",
    "this process was iterated , each time increasing the allowed degree of spatial variability in the fit , starting from a spatially - constant psf and ending at a third - order polynomial variation with field position .",
    "this degree of variability is an advantage of the stand - alone daophot - ii code , as the iraf version only allows a second - order trace of the strong spatial variation in the acs / wfc psf .",
    "once we stopped increasing the degree of spatial variability in the psf , we iterated two more times , purging problematic psf stars after each new round of psf production , until an accurate spatially - varying psf was created for each bandpass in each field . in the end",
    ", @xmath01600 stars were used to create the psf in the disk and spheroid fields , while @xmath01400 stars were used in the stream field .    with the empirical psfs in hand , we performed psf - fitting photometry on the images to create the catalog of stars in each field",
    ". first , we used the `` find '' routine in the daophot - ii package and a 5@xmath31 detection threshold on the sum of the f606w and f814w images , to create the initial pass at object detection . after making an initial estimate of magnitudes for the catalog with a round of aperture photometry in each band",
    ", the catalog was cleaned of psf substructure misidentified as stars in the vicinity of well - exposed stars .",
    "the aperture photometry was then used as the starting point for psf - fitting photometry .",
    "after these stars were fitted and subtracted from each image , we summed the residual images in f606w and f814w to create a new detection image , which was again fed to the find routine with a 5@xmath31 threshold .",
    "the detections in this second pass were often noise residuals from the subtraction of the stars in the first pass , or other image artifacts revealed by the subtraction .",
    "our first screen of these artifacts was made using the sharpness measurement produced by the find algorithm .",
    "we cut 4@xmath31 outliers in the sharpness distribution .",
    "we then screened artifacts from bright star residuals ( consistent with poisson noise ) by removing detections within a given magnitude - dependent radius of stars in the first - pass catalog ; the radius is magnitude - dependent because for fainter stars , the residuals approach sky noise at a smaller radial distance from the center of the psf .",
    "we obtained aperture and then psf - fitting photometry of the second - pass stars , without re - centering , using the original f606w and f814w images ( i.e. , the deep drizzled images as they stood before any psf subtractions ) .",
    "the first - pass and second - pass star lists were then combined , and another run of psf - fitting photometry ( now allowing recentering ) was performed on the original f606w and f814w images .",
    "daophot - ii reports a goodness - of - fit ( @xmath30 ) statistic for the psf fits to each star ; we analyzed the distribution of this @xmath30 statistic as a function of stellar magnitude , and marked those objects in the deep images that had high @xmath30 values .",
    "inspection of the marked images showed that these outliers were primarily due to close blends , psf artifacts ( e.g. , diffraction spikes ) , and/or objects superimposed on background galaxies ( which include both true andromeda stars superimposed on background galaxies and substructure within background galaxies incorrectly identified as stars ) .",
    "we clipped from the catalog these outliers in the @xmath30 distribution .",
    "this clipping is responsible for much of the improvement between the cmds shown here and that shown in the preliminary publication of the spheroid cmd ( brown et al .",
    "2003 ) . finally , we discarded those stars falling in parts of the image without the full exposure ( due to dithering the image edges and the detector gap ) .",
    "note that our artificial star tests ( discussed below ) included all of the same processes and evaluations used in the process that created the photometric catalog , so that any rejection of real stars is reproduced in the simulated cmds .",
    "the psf - fitting photometry was put on an absolute magnitude scale by normalizing to aperture photometry on the brightest stars .",
    "that aperture photometry was itself put on an absolute magnitude scale using aperture corrections determined from tinytim ( krist 1995 ) models of the acs psf .",
    "the aperture corrections were verified with observations of the standard star eggr 102 ( a @xmath32  mag da white dwarf ) in the same filters ; the agreement between the standard star photometry and the tinytim model is at the 1% level . in figure  [ cmdsvels ]",
    ", we show the cmd for each field at its full depth , along with the associated velocity distribution of rgb stars in each field ( kalirai et al .  2006b ; rich et al .  in prep ;",
    "reitzel et al .  in prep . ) . due to the large numbers of stars in each field , a traditional cmd ( with a point for every star )",
    "is saturated and difficult to interpret ; instead , we have binned the data into hess diagrams , with shading indicating the number of stars per bin .",
    "the same logarithmic stretch ( characterized by the scales under each cmd ) spans the full range of stellar density in each cmd , but that range varies from field to field given the variation in surface brightness and observing depth .",
    "the stretch was chosen to reveal both the subtle and gross properties of each population .",
    "we also plot representative errors bars in each cmd , measured by taking the standard deviation between the input and output values for the given color and magnitude in our artificial star tests ( discussed below ) ; note that crowding is the dominant source of scatter in each bandpass , which causes photometric errors to be larger in either @xmath33 or @xmath34 than in @xmath35 .",
    "our photometry is in the stmag system : @xmath36  log@xmath37  mag , where @xmath38 e@xmath39 , exptime is the exposure time , and photflam is @xmath40 erg s@xmath28 @xmath12 @xmath28 / ( e@xmath41 s@xmath28 ) for the f606w filter and @xmath42 erg qs@xmath28 @xmath12 @xmath28 / ( e@xmath41 s@xmath28 ) for the f814w filter . the stmag system is a convenient system because it is referenced to an unambiguous flat @xmath43 spectrum ; an object with @xmath44 erg s@xmath28 @xmath12 @xmath28 has a magnitude of 0 in every filter .",
    "another convenient and unambiguous system that is widely used is the abmag system : @xmath45  log@xmath46  mag ; it is referenced to a flat @xmath47 spectrum , such that an object with @xmath48 erg s@xmath28 @xmath12 hz@xmath28 has a magnitude of 0 in every filter .",
    "it is thus trivial and unambiguous to convert any of the data presented herein from stmag to abmag : for f606w , abmag  =  stmag  @xmath49  0.169  mag , and for f814w , abmag  =  stmag  @xmath49  0.840  mag .",
    "although our photometry could be transformed to ground magnitude systems ( e.g. , johnson @xmath8 and cousins @xmath9 ) for comparison to theoretical isochrones as well as other data in the literature , such transformations always introduce significant systematic errors ( see sirianni et al .",

    "( 2006 ) found excellent agreement between the hb and rgb distributions in the stream and spheroid populations if the stream is assumed to be 0.03  mag ( 11 kpc ) more distant than the spheroid .",
    "the sense of the offset in luminosity is in agreement with the velocities of the stars in the stream , which imply that the stream is falling into andromeda from behind it ( figure  [ cmdsvels]b ; see also mcconnachie et al .",
    "brown et al .  ( 2006 ) also found a 0.014  mag offset in color between the stream and spheroid data , which is well within the uncertainties in calibration and reddening .",
    "thus , we shifted the stream cmd 0.03  mag brighter and 0.014  mag to the red , to put it in the same frame of reference as the spheroid data .",
    "these shifts are very small , and make very little difference to the cmds displayed herein or to the various fits to the stream data , but we apply these shifts because they are appropriate to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the distinctions between the spheroid and disk cmds are far larger than the calibration and reddening uncertainties , and in fact no single shift in color and luminosity can align the features of the disk and spheroid cmds .",
    "thus , to the best of our knowledge , the distinctions between the disk and spheroid data are physical , and so the disk data are analyzed without modification .",
    "it is worth noting the implications of our shifts to the stream data if these shifts are entirely due to a difference in extinction .",
    "the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) extinction map gives @xmath17  mag at our spheroid and disk positions and @xmath50  mag at our stream position , but this variation is within the uncertainties for their map , which are generally @xmath51  mag in random fields and a bit higher near local group galaxies . at 3,500  @xmath52",
    "35,000  k , synthetic spectra folded through the acs and ground bandpasses imply @xmath53 .",
    "so , if we took the map at face value , we would shift the stream data 0.03  mag to the red and 0.05  mag fainter , to put the stream data in the same extinction reference frame as the spheroid data . however , a 0.03  mag shift to the red is larger than the 0.014  mag required to align the stream and spheroid color distributions at the hb and rgb .",
    "given the uncertainties in the extinction map , we could instead shift the stream data 0.014  mag to the red and 0.02  mag fainter .",
    "this would align the color distributions of the stream and spheroid at the hb and rgb , but the stream hb would be @xmath54  mag fainter than the spheroid hb , implying that the stream distance modulus in our field is 0.05  mag larger than the spheroid distance modulus . in any case , given that the calibration uncertainties for the @xmath55 color are also at the same level as the color shift , it is not appropriate to read too deeply into these small shifts in color and magnitude between the fields .",
    "damage to the ccds due to radiation in space leads to charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , a problem that is particularly noticeable in large - format ccds .",
    "cti causes stars to appear fainter than they actually are .",
    "the acs wfc detector consists of two chips , with @xmath56 imaging pixels each , separated by a small gap .",
    "each ccd is read out through two serial amplifiers , with 24 physical pixels of leading serial overscan for each and 20 rows of trailing virtual overscan in the parallel clocking direction , yielding a final downlinked image format of @xmath57 for each ccd .",
    "stars that fall closer to the gap undergo more parallel transfers when the detector is read , and thus suffer from more charge loss due to cti ( for these ccds , at the acs operating temperature and clocking rates , the cti effects after radiation exposure are much more significant in the parallel clocking direction than in the serial ) .",
    "the cti correction is approximately linear with the position of a star relative to the gap , and approximately linear with the age of the detector .",
    "the correction is larger for faint stars and smaller when there is a significant background .",
    "our spheroid field was observed shortly after the acs launch , while the stream and disk fields were observed two years later .",
    "the standard cti correction ( riess & mack 2005 ) was derived for brighter stars with lower backgrounds than the situation in our images .",
    "thus , it is somewhat uncertain whether or not one should extrapolate these cti corrections into the regime of our data , which includes the deepest stellar photometry obtained with _",
    "hst _ to date .",
    "fortunately , cti does not appear to be a significant problem in our images .",
    "we checked the effects of cti by constructing cmds of stars extracted from a range of horizontal bands across the image .",
    "the cmd includes two horizontal features separated by approximately 3  mag in luminosity : the hb and the subgiant branch ( sgb ) .",
    "the luminosity of each of these features can be determined by taking a vertical cut through the cmd in the vicinity of each feature ( using a region restricted in color to avoid other evolutionary phases ) .",
    "if cti were a significant problem in our data , one would expect the luminosity offset between the hb and sgb to vary by a few hundredths of a magnitude as a function of vertical position in the image , given the intensity of the sources and the observed sky background . in reality",
    ", we find that this offset varies by @xmath580.001  mag across the image .",
    "thus , there are probably additional factors contributing to the cti mitigation , besides the sky background of @xmath0100 counts per pixel . because the images are crowded with stars and background galaxies , most stars are clocked across pixels where the charge traps have already been filled by other sources . given the lack of evidence for cti , we do not attempt a cti correction . note that any cti correction applied to these data would tend to make the stellar populations look slightly younger , because the fainter main sequence and subgiant stars would have a larger correction than the brighter hb stars .",
    "we next performed extensive artificial star tests to characterize the completeness and photometric scatter as a function of color and magnitude in each field .",
    "these tests required months of computations on a dedicated cluster of 10 processors . in all , 5 million artificial stars were added to each field and blindly recovered , with these stars spanning the full range of color and magnitude populated by the stellar locus .",
    "these stars were added in 1000 passes with 5000 stars per pass , to avoid significantly increasing the crowding in the images .",
    "the artificial stars were blindly recovered with a process identical to that used for the photometric catalog .",
    "the completeness exceeds 80% at @xmath59  mag in the spheroid data , and exceeds 80% at @xmath60  mag in the disk and stream data , but it drops off rapidly below these magnitudes .",
    "these limits drive the faint limit of the region we fit for the star formation history .",
    "note that the images detect stars significantly fainter than those presented in the cmds presented here ; compared to the reduction of brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the catalog depth and completeness have been somewhat reduced by the higher detection threshold and rigorous cleaning process we have employed here .",
    "before turning to the quantitative fitting of the cmds , much can be learned from simple visual inspection .",
    "the cmd for the population in each field is shown in figure  [ cmdsvels ] . at first glance ,",
    "all three cmds look remarkably similar , even though the populations have distinct kinematics .",
    "all of them show a broad rgb , indicative of a wide metallicity range . in each field , the majority of the stars between the msto and the base of the rgb are clustered in a tight locus .",
    "given the spread in metallicity , this tight sgb locus indicates a wide range in age , with younger stars generally more metal - rich than older stars .",
    "a minority population of stars appears in a blue plume above the msto , representing a young population with a wide range of metallicities .",
    "we return to the sgb and blue plume below .",
    "each of the fields has a well - defined hb , although the hb in the disk field is largely restricted to a red clump , while in the stream and spheroid @xmath010% of the hb stars fall on the blue end of the hb .",
    "none of the fields have an extended hot hb , as seen in massive galactic globular clusters spanning a wide range in metallicity ( e.g. , m19 , at [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath61 , and ngc6441 , at [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath62 ; piotto et al .  1999 ;",
    "rich et al .",
    "1997 ) . instead , the blue hb , when present , very closely resembles that of typical metal - poor clusters , such as m92 , at [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath63 ( see brown et al .",
    "the rgb luminosity function bump is prominent in each cmd , at a luminosity @xmath00.5  mag fainter than the red end of the hb ; this bump is a metallicity indicator , becoming fainter ( relative to the hb ) at higher metallicities , and in all three fields its spread in luminosity is another indication of a spread in metallicity .",
    "none of the cmds shows multiple discrete turnoffs , as might be expected from pulses of star formation .    in figure  [ comparegrid ]",
    ", we compare the cmds to our globular cluster fiducials ( table  [ tabclus ] ; brown et al .",
    "2005 ) . due to their wide range of metallicities ,",
    "the clusters span most of the rgb width in the m31 cmds .",
    "however , because the clusters are old , there is an obvious trend for the msto and sgb in the more metal - rich clusters to be too faint relative to those features in the m31 cmds . in the bottom panels of figure  [ comparegrid ] , we show a comparison of the m31 cmds to calibrated isochrones at three different ages ( 3 , 8 , and 13 gyr ) and three different metallicities ( [ fe / h ]  =  0 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ) .",
    "it is clear that the old ( @xmath66  gyr ) populations in these fields must be predominantly metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath67 ) , and that the metal - rich populations ( [ fe / h]@xmath68 ) must be of intermediate age ( @xmath698  gyr ) .",
    "an old metal - rich population would have a msto much redder and fainter than observed , while an intermediate - age metal - poor population would have a msto much bluer and brighter than observed .",
    "that said , there is a minority population of young stars spanning a wide range in metallicity , with the brightest and bluest stars in the plume matched by the 3  gyr isochrone at [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath65 .",
    "the implications of the sgb distribution warrant additional discussion .",
    "the isochrones in figure  [ comparegrid ] show that the luminosity of the sgb decreases with either increasing age or increasing metallicity .",
    "thus , different age - metallicity relations for the stars in our cmds would be expected to produce different luminosity distributions across the sgb . to evaluate the implications of this constraint , we show in figure  [ sgbwidth ] hypothetical populations of stars in the vicinity of the sgb as they would appear if observed under the same conditions as in our spheroid field .",
    "the upper panels present the age - metallicity relations of the isochrones employed to construct each model population , with the stars divided equally among the isochrones .",
    "the lower panels show the corresponding cmds resulting from these hypothetical populations . even with a very wide range in age",
    ", a single metallicity does not reproduce the width of the rgb ( panels @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) ; this is because the rgb is far more sensitive to metallicity than to age .",
    "moreover , the sgb luminosity distribution is much wider than observed . if one has old metal - rich stars and young metal - poor stars ( panels @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) , the rgb becomes much wider , but the sgb luminosity distribution is still much wider than observed . if all of the stars are at a single age ( panels @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) , the sgb narrows , but it is still wider than the sgb observed in our fields .",
    "it is only when one has young metal - rich stars and old metal - poor stars ( panels @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) that the sgb locus becomes very tight and horizontal , as observed for the dominant populations in our three cmds , while at the same time reproducing a wide rgb . because the rgb is more sensitive to metallicity than to age , while the msto is very sensitive to both , one is able to break the age - metallicity degeneracy in studies employing this region of the cmd . note that relatively young and metal - poor stars ( panels @xmath70 , @xmath72 , @xmath71 , and @xmath73 ) are needed to explain the brightest and bluest stars in the blue plume of our observed cmds .",
    "the similarities at the hb and rgb between the stream and spheroid imply that these populations have very similar metallicity distributions , at least at the positions of our fields ( brown et al .",
    "much farther out in the galaxy ( 31 kpc from the center ) , guhathakurta et al .  ( 2006 ) found that the stream was more metal - rich than the surrounding spheroid , but this finding is not inconsistent with our results .",
    "kalirai et al .",
    "( 2006a ) have shown that the spheroid of andromeda has a metallicity gradient , such that it is significantly more metal poor at 30 kpc than it is close to the galaxy s center .",
    "our finding of similar metallicities between the stream and spheroid in our interior fields , when combined with the guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 2006 ) results , reaffirms the existence of this metallicity gradient .",
    "although the cmds for each field have many similarities , closer inspection reveals significant distinctions , especially between the disk and the other two fields .",
    "we highlight these distinctions in figure  [ compare ] , which shows the differences between the stream and spheroid and also those between the disk and spheroid .",
    "the spheroid data used in each comparison are a subset that reaches approximately the same depth as the stream and disk data .",
    "the spheroid cmd was also scaled to the number of stars in each of the other two cmds before subtracting ; note that it makes little difference if this normalization is done based on the total number of stars in each field or just those well above the detection limits ( e.g. , @xmath78  mag ) .",
    "relative to the spheroid main sequence , the stream main sequence extends somewhat farther to the blue , even though the rgb and hb distributions are nearly identical .",
    "thus , the age distribution in the stream must extend to slightly younger ages than those in the spheroid ( as also noted by brown et al .",
    "in contrast , the distributions of age and metallicity in the disk extend to significantly younger ages and higher metallicities than those in the spheroid and stream , and the old metal - poor population is not as prominent .",
    "the rgb stars in the disk are skewed toward redder colors , while the hb population is largely restricted to the red clump ; both of these features indicate a higher metallicity in the disk . in the disk population ,",
    "the red clump hb is also somewhat extended in luminosity , indicating a younger age distribution ( an excellent example of the variation in clump luminosity with age can be seen in the monelli et al .",
    "[ 2003 ] study of the carina dwarf spheroidal ) .",
    "there does not appear to be a significant population on the blue hb , although a trace population might be hidden in the blue plume of stars rising above the dominant msto ; figure  [ compare]f shows an oversubtraction of the blue hb from the spheroid ( _ dark boxes _ ) appearing within the cloud of undersubtracted blue plume stars from the disk ( _ light boxes _ ) .",
    "the stronger plume in the disk population indicates an extension to significantly younger ages .",
    "the plume in the disk population includes @xmath1640 stars that are brighter than the region where the blue end of the hb would nominally fall , implying that these bright blue stars have masses of @xmath025  @xmath79 and ages of @xmath00.21 gyr .",
    "note that cuillandre et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have also seen evidence for trace populations of young stars in the outer disk of m31 .",
    "however , the disk does not look quite as young as one might expect if there were a significant thin disk population  a point we will return to later .    in a field population , it is difficult to distinguish between young metal - poor stars and old blue stragglers ( see carney , latham , & laird 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "thus , some of the apparently young stars in our cmds ( @xmath80  gyr ) might instead be blue stragglers .",
    "however , whether blue stragglers form via merger or mass transfer , in an old population they will be limited to @xmath812  @xmath79 .",
    "all three of our fields show blue plume stars as bright as the hb over a wide range of color , and in the disk these stars continue to luminosities significantly brighter than the hb .",
    "the high masses required to explain the brightest stars in the blue plume population imply that truly young stars are present , and these stars appear to be a smooth extension of the fainter blue plume population .",
    "this argues against a significant contribution from blue stragglers in the blue plume .",
    "if we fit gaussian distributions to the velocity data in our fields ( figure  [ cmdsvels ] ) , we find that the spheroid is a @xmath025% contamination in our stream field and a @xmath033% contamination in our disk field . given the wide separation between our fields ( figure  [ mapfig ] )",
    ", we can not necessarily assume that the population in our spheroid field is representative of the spheroid contamination in our stream and disk fields .",
    "however , it is natural to ask how the stream and disk cmds would look if the spheroid contamination were subtracted under the assumption that the population in our spheroid field is in fact representative of this contamination . to show this",
    ", we used that subset of the spheroid data that is matched to the depth of the stream and disk data .",
    "we randomly drew a star from these spheroid data , found the star in the stream data that most closely agreed in its photometry , and then subtracted that star from the stream data .",
    "these subtractions were repeated until 25% of the stream stars were removed . in 99% of the subtractions ,",
    "the star subtracted from the stream data was within 0.02  mag of the spheroid star , and in 99.9% of the subtractions , the star subtracted from the stream data was within 0.1  mag of the spheroid star ; the handful of stars that could not be matched at this level fell very far from the dominant stellar locus ( in the negligible cloud of sparse stars at random colors and magnitudes ) , and these were not subtracted .",
    "we repeated this process on the disk data , but there subtracted 33% of the disk stars ; again , 99% of the subtractions matched disk to spheroid stars within 0.02  mag , while 99.9% of the subtractions",
    "matched disk to spheroid stars within 0.1  mag .",
    "the resulting cmds are shown in figure  [ subtract ] . because of the many similarities between the original three cmds ( figure  [ cmdsvels ] ) , the changes due to the subtraction of the spheroid contamination are subtle . to help highlight the differences between the three fields ,",
    "we also show luminosity and color cuts across the cmds ( _ colored boxes _ ) ; panels @xmath76 and @xmath71 show the color distributions on the lower rgb and hb , respectively , while panels @xmath73 and @xmath75 show the luminosity distributions at the red clump and sgb , respectively .",
    "the color and luminosity cuts help quantify the similarities and differences between the populations discussed above and shown in figure  [ compare ] . compared to the spheroid population ,",
    "the stream population exhibits similar rgb and hb morphologies , but its main sequence extends somewhat brighter and bluer .",
    "in contrast , the disk population exhibits rgb and hb morphologies that are skewed toward redder colors , with the main sequence showing a strong extension to brighter and bluer colors .",
    "we turn now to the quantitative fitting of our cmds .",
    "our characterization of the star formation history in each field primarily uses the starfish code of harris & zaritsky ( 2001 ) .",
    "this code takes a grid of isochrones , populates them according to the initial mass function ( imf ) , then applies the photometric scatter and incompleteness ( as a function of magnitude and color ) determined in the artificial star tests .",
    "the code then fits the observed cmd by employing linear combinations of the scattered isochrones .",
    "the fitting can be done via minimization of either a @xmath30 statistic or the maximum likelihood statistic of dolphin ( 2002 ) .",
    "we found little difference between fits done with either statistic , and ultimately used the maximum likelihood statistic in our analysis .    in the starfish",
    "fitting , each isochrone at a given age and metallicity is varied independently , resulting in a large number of free parameters in the fit .",
    "this method is similar to most of the star formation history methods used in the literature ( e.g. , dolphin 2002 ; skillman et al .",
    "although the term `` star formation history '' might imply a physical connection between the subpopulations , this method is really a fit to the age and metallicity distributions .",
    "in addition to starfish , we wrote our own codes that fit the isochrones to the data according to mathematical and physical restrictions that greatly reduce the number of free parameters ; these models will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "we do not fit the entire range of stars observed in the cmd .",
    "instead , we restrict our fits to the lower rgb ( below the level of the hb ) , sgb , and upper main sequence .",
    "specifically , we fit over @xmath82  mag in color , and @xmath83  mag in magnitude for the spheroid data and @xmath84  mag in magnitude for the stream and disk data ( which are @xmath160.5  mag shallower ) .",
    "this region of the cmd offers excellent sensitivity to age and metallicity while avoiding those regions of the cmd that have low signal - to - noise ratio or that are poorly constrained by the models ( such as the hb , the upper rgb , the rgb luminosity function bump , and the faint end of the cmd ) .",
    "the hb is a qualitative indicator of age and metallicity , becoming redder at younger ages and higher metallicities , and eventually forming a red clump with a significant spread in luminosity .",
    "however , disentangling the effects of age and metallicity is highly uncertain ; indeed , the `` second parameter debate '' in the study of hb morphology refers to the dependence of the hb morphology on parameters other than metallicity , such as age and helium abundance .",
    "although galactic foreground stars comprise much less than 1% of the stars in our field , they tend to fall near the upper rgb in m31 , which is sparsely populated in our data ; the upper rgb is thus the one region of our cmds with significant foreground dwarf contamination . in addition , the upper rgb is contaminated by asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , which in turn have a distribution depending on the age and [ fe / h ] of their progenitor hb stars .",
    "the rgb luminosity function bump is a qualitative metallicity indicator , and it is most prominent in cmds of metal - rich populations , where it appears as an overdensity on the rgb immediately below the luminosity of the hb ; theoretical models reproduce the general trend for the bump luminosity to brighten with decreasing metallicity , but the zeropoint of the relationship is uncertain , and the mix of age and metallicity in our populations makes it difficult to interpret this feature in the data .",
    "the faintest main sequence stars in the cmd suffer from large photometric scatter and low completeness .",
    "we use the victoria - regina isochrones ( vandenberg et al .",
    "2006 ) in all of our fitting .",
    "these isochrones do not include core he diffusion , which would decrease their ages at a given turnoff luminosity by @xmath85% ( vandenberg et al .",
    "although the ages of isochrones with core he diffusion are likely more accurate , models in which diffusion is allowed to act efficiently on other elements in the surface layers show significant discrepancies when compared to observed cmds , indicating that there must be some other mechanism at work , such as turbulence in the surface layers ( see brown et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "helium diffusion can still occur in the core , and thus the ages discussed herein should be reduced by @xmath010% to obtain absolute ages .",
    "the victoria - regina isochrones are distributed with a ground - based magnitude system .",
    "sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) provide an iterative transformation to put acs data in a ground - based system , but warn against its use , given the systematic errors intrinsic to such a process .",
    "the biggest problem is that the f606w bandpass is very different from johnson @xmath8 , although the difference between f814w and cousins @xmath9 is nonnegligible , too . to properly make the transformation from one system to the other , one must know the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of the source , and this is difficult to estimate based on photometry in two broad bandpasses .",
    "it is much more straightforward to use the physical parameters along each model isochrone ( effective temperature and surface gravity ) to transform the models into the observational system using synthetic spectra of the appropriate metallicity .",
    "we use the transformation of brown et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which produces good agreement between these isochrones and the acs observations of galactic clusters spanning a wide range in metallicity ( table  [ tabclus ] ) .",
    "over most of the cmd ( including the region we use here for fitting ) , the agreement is better than @xmath00.02  mag . in this sense , we are using the isochrones to provide relative changes in age and metallicity , once they have been anchored to observations of galactic clusters .",
    "we are thus providing star formation histories in a reference frame based on the ages and metallicities of the clusters listed in table  [ tabclus ] .",
    "we fit a large grid of isochrones spanning @xmath86  age  @xmath87  gyr ( with 0.5 gyr steps ) and @xmath88  [ fe / h ]  @xmath89 ( with @xmath160.1 dex steps ) using the starfish code .",
    "the fine spacing in age and metallicity avoids artificial lumpiness in the synthetic cmds but means that neighboring isochrones in the grid are nearly degenerate .",
    "such degeneracies , plus the large number of free parameters , do not allow a fit to converge in a reasonable time .",
    "fortunately , the starfish code allows groups of neighboring isochrones to be locked such that their amplitudes vary together ; one of these isochrone groups is treated as a single isochrone as far as the fitting is concerned , even if its stars span a small range in age and metallicity ( see harris & zaritsky 2001 for details ) .",
    "we locked our full grid of isochrones into 117 independent isochrone groups , with the sampling chosen to match the nonlinear changes in the cmd with age and metallicity ( the cmd changes more rapidly at higher metallicities and younger ages ) .",
    "the grid of isochrones and the locked isochrone groups are shown in figure  [ gridfig ] .",
    "-0.1 in      besides distance and reddening , there are several other parameters that must be fixed before proceeding with a fit .",
    "the binary fraction is highly uncertain , and not even well - constrained in the field or cluster populations of our own galaxy ; the value appears to be in the range of 1030% in the field population of the galactic halo ( ryan 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "the fits to our data are best when the binary fraction is near 10% , whereas fits with the binary fraction significantly deviating from 10% show noticeable residuals . thus ,",
    "unless specified otherwise , the binary fraction is assumed to be 10% throughout this paper .",
    "the binary fraction is set in the starfish code ( harris & zaritsky 2001 ) at the stage where it scatters the isochrones ; specifically , for a given fraction of stars , it draws a second star randomly from the imf and produces a single unresolved object with the combined color and magnitude of the two stars . for the imf index , we chose the salpeter ( 1955 ) value of @xmath90 .",
    "for the isochrone abundances , we did not assume a scaled - solar abundance pattern .",
    "instead , we assumed that the alpha elements are enhanced at low metallicity and unenhanced ( scaled - solar ) at high metallicity ; specifically , we assumed [ @xmath91/fe ]  =  0.3 at [ fe / h ]  @xmath92 and [ @xmath91/fe ]  =  0.0 at [ fe / h ]  @xmath93 . at the [ @xmath91/fe ]",
    "resolution available in our isochrone grid , this trend roughly reproduces that seen in the galaxy ( pritzl , venn , & irwin 2005 and references therein ) , although bulge populations appear to be enhanced in alpha elements even at high metallicity ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 ; rich & origlia 2005 ) .",
    "as it turns out , the imf and alpha - enhancement assumptions make little difference in our results .",
    "all of these assumptions ( distance , reddening , binary fraction , imf , and alpha enhancement ) are varied in our exploration of systematic errors ( see  [ syssec ] ) .      in the fits below , we do not plot error bars for the weights of the individual isochrones .",
    "this is because the uncertainty associated with the normalization of any individual isochrone is very large , and correlated with the normalization of neighboring isochrones .",
    "if any one isochrone in the best - fit model is deleted from the fit , compensating changes can be made in neighboring isochrones that restore the quality of the fit .",
    "the result is that the uncertainty on any individual isochrone weight is largely meaningless .",
    "these difficulties are a continuing plague for studies of star formation histories in complex populations ( e.g. , skillman et al .",
    "2003 ; harris & zaritsky 2004 ) . if one is fitting a simple stellar population ( single age and single metallicity ) , one can trace out confidence contours in the age - metallicity plane according to the change in fit quality , but with a complex star formation history , it is the distribution of ages and metallicities that matters . what one really wants is a set of isochrones that are truly eigenfunctions of an orthogonal basis set . however , there is not an obvious basis function that relates in a simple way back to physical parameters .",
    "the sampling in our isochrone grid is fine enough to avoid artificial structure in the synthetic cmds , yet coarse enough to avoid isochrones that are completely degenerate within the photometric errors .",
    "even though some of the isochrone weights in the final fits are very small , the ensemble of these small weights is necessary for a good fit .",
    "one way of demonstrating this assertion is by repeating the fits after deleting isochrones with low weights . starting with the best fit ,",
    "we first sorted the isochrones by their fitted weights , and then retained only those whose weight exceeded a specified cutoff ; specifically , the cutoff in weight was chosen so that this subset of isochrones accounted for 90% of the stars in the best fit .",
    "refitting with this reduced set of isochrones produced terrible fits ( fit score @xmath050% larger ) .",
    "the fit was also poor when we retained those isochrones responsible for 95% of the stars in the best fit .",
    "the fit did not become acceptable until we had retained those isochrones responsible for 99% of the stars in the best fit ( @xmath050 of the original 117 isochrone groups ) .",
    "the distribution of age and metallicity in our best fit to the spheroid data is shown in figure  [ halofit ] . in this figure , the area of the symbols ( _ filled circles _ ) is proportional to the number of stars in each isochrone group .",
    "note that the spacing of the isochrone groups is irregular , so that if one were to plot a star formation rate in units of @xmath79 per unit time per unit logarithmic metallicity , the relative sizes of the symbols would be somewhat increased at younger ages and higher metallicities ( where the spacing is finer ) . as noted by brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the spheroid cmd is best fitted by a wide range of age and metallicity , and is strikingly different from the old , metal - poor halo of the milky way .",
    "approximately 40% of the stars are less than 10  gyr old , and approximately 50% of the stars are more metal - rich than 47  tuc ( [ fe / h]@xmath94 ) .",
    "the mean metallicity , @xmath95[fe / h]@xmath96=@xmath97 , is identical to that found by durrell et al .",

    "( 1996 ) from earlier wfpc2 photometry of our field , with similar spreads to both higher and lower metallicities .",
    "although our mean metallicity is much higher than that in the milky way halo , the metallicity distribution definitely has a tail extending to metal - poor stars .",
    "these include the rr lyrae stars in our field , which have a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath98 ( brown et al.2004a ) , and the minority population of blue hb stars .",
    "-0.1 in    although we used the dolphin ( 2002 ) maximum likelihood statistic to perform our fits , we also compared the results with those obtained from a traditional @xmath30 statistic , and the fits were similar .",
    "dolphin ( 2002 ) also provides a goodness of fit statistic , @xmath99 , for those more familiar with @xmath30 fitting ( with values close to unity indicating a good fit ) .",
    "the best fit model ( figure  [ halofit ] ) has @xmath100 per degree of freedom ( 8000 cmd bins minus 117 freely varying isochrone weights ) .",
    "this score clearly implies an imperfect fit . to demonstrate this",
    ", we ran monte carlo simulations of the idealized case .",
    "we created random realizations of the data drawn from the best - fit model to obtain the distribution of the maximum likelihood statistic , and found that the maximum likelihood statistic obtained in our best - fit model exceeds the mean score by 6@xmath31 ( where @xmath31 is one standard deviation in the distribution of the maximum likelihood statistic from the monte carlo runs ) .",
    "there are many reasons why the model should not exactly reproduce the data .",
    "these include imperfections in the isochrones ( they are calibrated at the @xmath00.02  mag level against galactic globular clusters observed in the same filters ) , deviations from a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , deviation from our assumed binary fraction of 10% ( e.g. ,",
    "one might imagine that the binary fraction varies with age and metallicity depending on the variations in the formation environment ) , and the limitations of the artificial star tests used to scatter the isochrones ( artificial stars are created , with noise , from the same psf model used in the psf fitting , while real stars will deviate from the psf model due to noise and true intrinsic inaccuracies in the psf model ) .",
    "although the model does not exactly reproduce the data distribution over 8000 cmd bins , the deviations are remarkably small , as we show in figure  [ halomod ] . in the top row of panels ,",
    "we show the data in the fitting region ( _ yellow _ ) , the best - fit model ( _ blue _ ) , and the differences between the two ( _ yellow _ and _ blue _ ) shown at the same linear stretch ; i.e. , the cmd bins in panel @xmath74 are shaded blue where the model exceeds the data , and shaded yellow where the data exceeds the model , with the shading on the same linear scale employed in panels @xmath70 and @xmath72 .",

    "one way to test this is through repeated fitting with distinct initial conditions .",

    "although there are small variations in the final individual isochrone weights , it is clear that the overarching result is the same in each case .",
    "as stated earlier , the degeneracies in the isochrone set mean that any individual isochrone can be varied significantly without changing the fit quality .",
    "for example , in figure  [ converge ] , the relatively low weight at [ fe / h]=@xmath98 , compared to the weights at [ fe / h]=@xmath102 and [ fe / h]=@xmath63 , is not meaningful ; for the isochrones at 13  gyr , we can redistribute the weights at [ fe / h]=@xmath102 , @xmath98 , and @xmath63 so that they are the same in each of these bins , and the fit quality does not suffer .",

    "if our disk population is representative of the outer disk in general , creating the stream from a disruption of disk material would not result in a stream hosting so many old and metal - poor stars .",
    "this does not preclude significant contamination of the spheroid by disrupted disk stars  the population mix in our spheroid field might be an older metal - poor halo with some contribution of disrupted disk stars ",
    "but we are still left with coincidence to explain the similarity between the stream and spheroid populations .",
    "recently , worthey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) put forth a provocative hypothesis , based on chemical evolution arguments and the high metallicity of the andromeda spheroid : that all fields in the spheroid observed to date are actually dominated by the disk .",
    "they suggested that this hypothesis could explain the surprisingly broad range of ages found in our spheroid field ( brown et al .",
    "more recently , ibata et al.(2005 ) found stars 40 kpc from the center of andromeda ( in all directions ) that appear to be moving in the disk . with the kinematic and population information available",
    ", we can show that the disk contribution in our spheroid field must be very small ( @xmath160% ) , as originally claimed by brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the relevant data are in figure  [ cmdsvels ] and table  [ fieldtab ] . given the disk inclination of 12.5@xmath161 , our spheroid field is 11 kpc from the galactic center in the plane of the sky and 51 kpc from the center in the plane of the disk .",
    "the disk field is 25 kpc from the galactic center in both the plane of the sky and the plane of the disk .",
    "figure  [ cmdsvels]c shows the distribution of velocities in our disk field .",
    "there are clearly two components .",
    "the broader component ( comprising @xmath01/3 of the population ) is at the systemic velocity of andromeda , while the narrower component is redshifted with respect to andromeda due to the rotation of the andromeda disk . in the worthey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) scenario , one would associate the broad component with the thick disk and the narrow component with the thin disk , with only the latter component significantly rotating .",
    "however , we know from the disk cmd that there is no evidence for a thin disk population in this field ; instead , the population appears to be dominated by a thick disk and spheroid .",
    "thus , it is much more plausible that the narrow velocity structure is the thick disk and the broad velocity structure is the spheroid .",
    "these designations would also explain why the narrow component is significantly rotating but the broad component is not .",
    "compared to the disk field , the spheroid field is twice as far from the galactic center in the plane of the disk , but half the distance from the galactic center in the plane of the sky .",
    "so , moving our attention from the disk field to the spheroid field , we expect the contribution from the disk to decline and the contribution from the spheroid to increase . with an exponential disk scale length of @xmath165  kpc ( walterbos & kennicutt 1988 )",
    ", the disk contribution must drop from the @xmath02/3 in the disk field to @xmath162% in the spheroid field . indeed ,",
    "figure  [ cmdsvels]a shows no indication of a single narrow component at the andromeda systemic velocity , as one would expect if the disk were dominating this position , 51 kpc on the minor axis .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting that the hydrogen column density in the spheroid field is nearly 25 times smaller than that in the disk field ( table  [ fieldtab ] ) .",
    "ibata et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found stars moving with disk velocities at distances of 1540 kpc from the galactic center , but they note that our spheroid field lies beyond the break in the density profile of their `` disk - like structure . ''",
    "they show no evidence that this structure should comprise a significant population in our field .",
    "the velocity dispersion in their extended disk is 30 km s@xmath28 , which is much narrower than the 80 km s@xmath28 we see in our spheroid field .",
    "the velocity dispersion in our spheroid field is in agreement with the kinematics of the planetary nebulae ( halliday et al .",
    "2006 ; hurley - keller et al .",
    "2004 ) , which show a distribution of similar breadth and evidence for some rotational support .",
    "an additional piece of evidence comes from the similarity of the stream and spheroid populations , given that the worthey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) hypothesis rests largely on metallicity .",
    "if metallicity alone were enough to prove that a field in andromeda is dominated by disk stars , one could try to argue that our stream field was dominated by disk stars , too .",
    "however , it is clear from the morphology , hb luminosity , and kinematics in our stream field that @xmath075% of the population in this field is comprised of two kinematically - cold components falling toward andromeda ( kalirai et al .",
    "there is no way that the stream is composed of stars residing in the andromeda disk .    on all of these grounds",
    ", one can see that the spheroid field must have a negligible contribution from stars currently moving in the andromeda disk .",
    "it is also clear that the spheroid velocity distribution is not as hot as one would expect for a hot halo , nor does it reflect the kinematics of the halo globular cluster system ( @xmath163 km s@xmath28 ; perrett et al .",
    "the high metallicity and wide age distribution of the spheroid is likely due to the merger history of andromeda , with the spheroid polluted by a combination of disrupted satellites , stars born in the merger(s ) , and stars disrupted from the andromeda disk .",
    "using deep _ hst _ observations of andromeda , we have reconstructed the complete star formation history in three fields : the spheroid , tidal stream , and outer disk .    in the best - fit model to the spheroid , 40% of the stars are metal - rich and younger than 10  gyr , in stark contrast to our own galactic halo .",
    "the data can not be reproduced by a population of old stars alone ( age  @xmath96  10  gyr ) . although the fit is dominated by old metal - poor stars and young metal - rich stars ,",
    "a non - negligible population of young metal - poor stars is also present , implying that at least some stars in the spheroid were accreted from dwarf galaxies or formed from relatively pristine infalling material . since the discovery of a metal - rich intermediate - age population in our spheroid field ( brown et al .",
    "2003 ) , various explanations have been put forth in the literature , including the hypothesis that the disk dominates all inner spheroid fields ( worthey et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the idea that our spheroid field is contaminated by the tidal stream and not representative of the inner spheroid in general ( ibata et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the former scenario ,",
    "the spheroid field is not special , but it is actually the disk instead of the spheroid , whereas in the latter scenario , the field is special , because it is the stream and not the spheroid .",
    "the constraints provided by the population and kinematic data argue that the spheroid field does not have a significant contribution from stars currently residing in andromeda s disk , but the young metal - rich population may be the result of stars disrupted from andromeda s disk by an earlier merger event .",
    "the star count maps and kinematic data show no evidence for a dominant stream passing through the spheroid field , as required to explain the similarity between the spheroid and stream populations by some chance intersection of the spheroid field with the stream s orbit .",
    "furthermore , the metallicity distribution in the spheroid field looks much like that observed in various other fields throughout the inner spheroid ( ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ; durrell et al .",
    "1994 , 2001 , 2004 ) .",
    "it is much more likely that the metal - rich populations throughout the inner spheroid are of intermediate age , as found in our spheroid field , instead of invoking the pathological situation where these metal - rich populations are ancient everywhere except in our spheroid field .    in the best - fit model to the stream ,",
    "70% of the stars are younger than 10  gyr .",
    "a detailed comparison of the age and metallicity distributions in the stream and spheroid shows them to be remarkably similar but distinct .",
    "it is unclear if the similarity implies that the stream s progenitor is representative of the objects that formed the inner spheroid or if the entire inner spheroid is polluted by stars stripped from the stream s progenitor during its particular disruption .",
    "the distinction between the disk and stream populations  with the stream including old metal - poor stars that are lacking in the disk  suggests that the stream is not comprised of stars disrupted from the andromeda disk .    the outer disk of andromeda more closely resembles the thick disk of the solar neighborhood than either the spheroid or the stream .",
    "although a trace population of 0.21.0  gyr stars is present , there are few stars younger than 4  gyr , and thus the outer disk does not appear to host a significant thin disk component .",
    "in the best - fit model to the disk data , 80% of the stars are younger than 10  gyr ; indeed , we also showed that these data are consistent with a population that is completely devoid of stars older than 10  gyr .",
    "the minority population of old metal - poor stars in the disk field is consistent with the field s kinematics , which show a @xmath033% contribution from the spheroid .",
    "if the population in this spheroid contribution is assumed to be the same as that in our spheroid field , the resulting model reproduces the data extremely well , and implies that @xmath070% of the stars in the outer disk are 48  gyr old .",
    "the disk of andromeda clearly shares the `` g dwarf problem '' seen in the solar neighborhood .    in the upcoming _",
    "hst _ observing cycle , we will be observing four more deep fields in the andromeda spheroid .",
    "one will be at @xmath022  kpc on the minor axis , and the other three will be in the vicinity of @xmath035  kpc on the minor axis , thus bracketing that point in the spheroid where there is a transition from a bulge - like population to one that more closely resembles a canonical halo . the star formation history in these additional fields should help to further disentangle the complex formation history of the andromeda system and its various substructures .",
