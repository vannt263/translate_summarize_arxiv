    "in this work we would like to illustrate and exemplify some general results from @xcite where the general framework of a morita theory which is covariant under a given hopf algebra was studied .",
    "one main motivation to do so is coming from ( deformation ) quantization theory @xcite , see e.g  @xcite for recent reviews . here",
    "morita equivalence provides an important notion of equivalence of observable algebras @xcite .",
    "in particular , on cotangent bundles the condition for star products to be morita equivalent is shown to coincide with dirac s integrality condition for magnetic charges of a background magnetic field @xcite leading to a natural interpretation of morita equivalence also in more general situations .    from the differential geometric point of view , it is a natural question whether all these techniques as developed in @xcite can be made compatible with a certain given symmetry of the underlying manifold . on the purely algebraic level ,",
    "a fairly general notion of ` symmetry ' is that of a hopf algebra action of a given hopf algebra . in @xcite",
    "we studied this type of symmetry in the general situation .    from this general framework we shall specialize now into two directions : on one hand",
    ", the algebras on which the symmetry acts and whose morita theory shall be studied will now be commutative : we are interested in the algebra of functions @xmath1 on a manifold . on the other hand",
    ", the symmetry in question will either be coming from a lie group action on @xmath2 or from a lie algebra action as its infinitesimal counterpart .",
    "it is well - known that two commutative algebras are morita equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic , see e.g. the textbook @xcite , whence for commutative algebras morita equivalence seems to be a useless notion .",
    "however , this is not true as things become interesting if one asks in addition in how many ways two algebras can be morita equivalent compared to the ways in which they can be isomorphic .",
    "it turns out that in general there are new possibilities which makes morita theory interesting even in the commutative framework .",
    "this phenomenon is precisely encoded in the so - called picard groupoid which we shall compute for the case of function algebras .",
    "this way , we find an interesting and non - trivial class of examples illustrating the general ideas of @xcite .",
    "moreover , it will also be of independent interest as we are now able to re - interpret several well - known problems and results in differential geometry from a morita theoretic point of view .",
    "finally , the commutative situation with the algebras being function algebras @xmath1 is expected to be the starting point for a discussion of morita equivalence of star products as in @xcite but now being compatible with a symmetry of the classical phase space @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : geometryalgebra ] we recall some well - known arguments why one should and how one can pass from a geometric to a more algebraic description of differential geometry . the next section is devoted to a general discussion on morita theory in different flavours , taking into account specific structures of the algebras in question .",
    "here we are mainly interested in @xmath0-involutions and notions of positivity . in section  [ sec : covariant ] we add one more structure to be preserved by morita theory , namely a symmetry which we model by a hopf algebra action . this can be specialized to group actions and lie algebra actions .",
    "the last section contains some new material , namely the explicit computation of a certain part of the lie algebra covariant picard group .",
    "* acknowledgments : * it is a pleasure for me to thank the organizers and in particular michel cahen and willy sarlet for their kind invitation to the 20th international workshop on differential geometric methods in theoretical mechanics in ghent where the content of this work was presented .",
    "moreover , i would like to thank stefan jansen and nikolai neumaier for valuable discussions and comments on the manuscript .",
    "in some sense , differential geometric methods in mathematical physics correspond mainly to classical theories : hamiltonian mechanics on a symplectic or poisson manifold @xmath2 is one prominent example . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum theories require a more algebraic approach : here the uncertainty relations in physics are modelled mathematically by non - trivial commutation relations between observables in some noncommutative algebra , the observable algebra .",
    "thus _ quantization _ in a very broad sense can be understood as the passage from geometric to noncommutative algebraic structures .",
    "an intermediate step is of course to encode the geometric structures on @xmath2 in algebraic terms based on the commutative algebra of functions @xmath1 where , in view of applications to quantization , it is convenient to consider complex - valued functions .",
    "then it is a folklore statement ( milnor s exercise ) that one can recover the smooth manifold @xmath2 from the @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 . more specifically : every @xmath0-homomorphism @xmath3 between function algebras is actually of the form @xmath4 with some smooth map @xmath5 between the underlying manifolds , see e.g.  @xcite for a recent discussion .",
    "thus the category of @xmath0-algebras with @xmath0-homomorphisms as morphisms becomes relevant to differential geometry .",
    "the ` dictionary ' to translate geometric to algebraic terms , which is also one of the cornerstones of connes noncommutative geometry @xcite , can be extended in various directions .",
    "we mention just one further example also relevant to morita theory : by the well - known serre - swan theorem , see e.g.@xcite , the ( complex ) vector bundles @xmath6 correspond to finitely generated projective modules over the algebra @xmath1 via @xmath7 . in more geometric terms",
    "this means that for any vector bundle there exists another vector bundle @xmath8 such that @xmath9 is a trivial vector bundle .",
    "this is of course the key to relate the algebraic @xmath10-theory of @xmath1 to the topological @xmath11-theory of @xmath2 .",
    "let us now turn to morita theory .",
    "its first motivation came from the question what one can say about two algebras @xmath12 and @xmath13 provided one knows that their categories of ( left ) modules are equivalent , see @xcite .",
    "clearly , in view of applications to quantum mechanics a good understanding of the more specific modules given by @xmath0-representations of the observable algebras on ( pre ) hilbert spaces is crucial for any physical interpretation . as we shall not start to define what a reasonable category of modules over the @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 should be though this",
    "can perfectly be done , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein we take a different motivation which will lead essentially to the same structures .",
    "the idea is to take the category of @xmath0-algebras , keep the objects and enhance the notion of morphisms .",
    "this can be expected to be interesting as for function algebras we already know what the ` ordinary ' morphisms are : pull - backs by smooth maps . thus a generalization would lead to a generalization of smooth maps between manifolds , when we translate things back using our ` dictionary ' . in particular , it might happen that algebras become isomorphic in this new , enhanced category ( which will turn out to be not the case for function algebras ) and one might have more ` automorphisms ' of a given algebra ( which will indeed be the case for function algebras ) . in general , the invertible morphisms in a category form a ( large ) groupoid in the obvious sense which is called the picard groupoid of the category .",
    "thus a major step in understanding the whole category is to consider its picard groupoid of invertible arrows first .    in principle",
    ", the whole idea should be familiar from geometric mechanics as one example of enhancing a category by allowing more general morphisms is given by the symplectic ` category ' : first one considers symplectic manifolds as objects and symplectomorphisms as morphisms .",
    "though this is a reasonable choice to look at , it turns out to be rather boring as the choice for the morphisms is too restrictive .",
    "more interesting is the ` category ' where one considers morphisms to be canonical relations , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "however , this is no longer an honest category since the composition of morphisms is only defined when certain technical requirements like clean intesections of the canonical relations are fulfilled .",
    "nevertheless this ` symplectic category ' is by far more interesting now .",
    "other examples are the morita theory for ( integrable ) poisson manifolds by xu @xcite as well as the morita theory of lie groupoids , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "after having outlined the general ideas in the previous section we should start being more concrete now . as warming up",
    "we discuss the ` enhancing of the category ' for the category of unital algebras with usual algebra morphisms first , see e.g.  @xcite for this classical approach .    here",
    "the generalized morphisms are the _ bimodules _ : for two algebras @xmath12 and @xmath13 a @xmath14-bimodule @xmath15 , which we shall frequently denote by @xmath16 to indicate that @xmath13 acts from the left while @xmath12 acts from the right , is considered as an arrow @xmath17",
    ".    why does this give a reasonable notion of morphisms ?",
    "in particular , we have to define the composition of morphisms .",
    "thus let @xmath16 and @xmath18 be bimodules then their tensor product @xmath19 over @xmath13 is a @xmath20-bimodule and hence an arrow @xmath21 .",
    "however , this is not yet an associative composition law as for three bimodules @xmath22 , @xmath18 , @xmath16 we have a _",
    "canonical isomorphism _ @xmath23 as @xmath24-bimodules but _ not equality_. the way out is to use isomorphism classes of bimodules as arrows instead of bimodules themselves .",
    "then the tensor product becomes indeed associative and the isomorphism class of the canonical bimodule @xmath25 serves as the identity morphism of the object @xmath12 since we use unital algebras for simplicity .",
    "the final restriction we have to impose is that in a category the morphism space between two objects has to be a set , which is a priori not clear in our enhanced category .",
    "therefor one should pose additional constraints on the bimodules like finitely generatedness .",
    "however , we shall ignore these subtleties in the following as the new notion of isomorphisms in this category will be unaffected anyway .",
    "however , we still have to show that we really get an extension of our previous notion of morphisms .",
    "thus let @xmath26 be an algebra homomorphism .",
    "then on @xmath13 we define a right @xmath12-module structure by @xmath27 and obtain a bimodule @xmath28 .",
    "its isomorphism class is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the class of @xmath25 whence our previous notion of morphisms is indeed contained in the new one .",
    "if we denote this new category by @xmath32 then two unital algebras @xmath12 and @xmath13 are called _ morita equivalent _ iff they are isomorphic in @xmath32 . without going into the details this is equivalent to the existence of a certain bimodule which is ` invertible ' with respect to the composition @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , such bimodules can be characterized rather explicitly , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the isomorphism classes of these invertible bimodules constitute now the _ picard groupoid _ of this category @xmath32 which we shall denote by @xmath34 .",
    "the invertible arrows from @xmath12 to @xmath13 are denoted by @xmath35 while the isotropy group of this groupoid at the local unit @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath36 , the _ picard group _ of @xmath12 .",
    "the map @xmath37 induces now a group homomorphism such that @xmath38 is exact , whence in the commutative case , the automorphism group of @xmath12 is a subgroup of the picard group @xmath36 .",
    "finally , it can be shown that for commutative @xmath12 , the exact sequence is split whence @xmath39 where the subgroup @xmath40 consists of the symmetric invertible bimodules , i.e. those where @xmath41 for all @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath40 is called the _ commutative _ or _ static picard group _ , see e.g.  @xcite for a discussion and further references .",
    "it is a well - known theorem in morita theory that for unital algebras @xmath12 , @xmath13 the equivalence bimodules @xmath16 are certain finitely generated projective right @xmath12-modules such that @xmath44 . coming back to our example",
    "@xmath45 we see , using the serre - swan theorem , that the only candidates for the symmetric self - equivalence bimodules are the sections @xmath46 of a complex _",
    "line bundle_. in fact , it turns out that @xmath46 is indeed invertible with inverse given by the class of @xmath47 since @xmath48 as @xmath1-bimodules .",
    "this shows that the static picard group of @xmath1 is just the ` geometric ' picard group , i.e. the group of isomorphism classes of complex line bundles with the tensor product as multiplication . using the chern class to classify complex line bundles",
    "then gives according to @xmath49 where the semidirect product structure comes from the usual action of diffeomorphisms on @xmath50 .",
    "in general , all morita equivalence bimodules @xmath16 for @xmath51 are isomorphic to some @xmath52 with a vector bundle @xmath6 of non - zero fibre dimension .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 has to be isomorphic to @xmath53 .",
    "thus for function algebras @xmath1 we have a complete description of the picard groupoid .",
    "we shall now specialize our notion of morita equivalence : we have already argued that the @xmath0-involution of @xmath1 should be taken into account when having applications to quantization in mind .",
    "moreover , one can include notions of positivity into morita theory .",
    "one defines a linear functional @xmath54 to be _ positive _ if @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "then an element @xmath43 is called _ positive _ if @xmath57 for all positive linear functionals @xmath58 of @xmath12 , see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "it is clear that for applications to quantum theories such notions of positive functionals are crucial as they encode expectation value functionals and hence the physical _ states _ for the observable algebra .    in particular",
    ", for @xmath45 one finds that positive linear functionals are precisely the integrations with respect to compactly supported positive borel measures .",
    "this follows essentially from riesz representation theorem , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "b ) . from this",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath59 is positive iff @xmath60 for all @xmath61 , whence the above , purely algebraic definition reproduces the usual notion .",
    "we can now state the definition of @xmath0-morita equivalence @xcite and strong morita equivalence bimodules , see @xcite as well as @xcite for rieffel s original formulation in the context of @xmath62-algebras and @xcite for the general case of @xmath0-algebras .",
    "instead of describing the ` enhanced category ' way , we directly give the definition in terms of bimodules which is entirely equivalent , see @xcite .",
    "[ definition : moritabimodules ] a @xmath0-morita equivalence bimodule @xmath16 is a @xmath63-bimodule together with inner products @xmath64 and @xmath65 such that for all @xmath66 , @xmath43 and @xmath67 we have :    1 .",
    "@xmath68 ( resp .",
    "@xmath69 ) is linear in the right ( resp",
    ". left ) argument .",
    "2 .   @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "4 .   @xmath74 and @xmath75 are non - degenerate . 5 .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 are full .",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 .",
    "if in addition the inner products are completely positive then @xmath16 is called a strong morita equivalence bimodule .    here",
    "@xmath74 is called _ full _ if the @xmath79-span of all elements @xmath80 is the whole algebra @xmath12 ; in general these elements constitute a @xmath0-ideal .",
    "moreover , @xmath74 is called _ completely positive _ if for all @xmath81 and all @xmath82 the matrix @xmath83 is positive in the @xmath0-algebra @xmath84 .",
    "the composition of bimodules is again the tensor product where on @xmath19 the @xmath12-valued inner product is now defined by rieffel s formula @xmath85 and analogously for the @xmath86-valued inner product .",
    "it is then a non - trivial theorem that this is indeed completely positive again , if the inner products on @xmath15 and @xmath87 have been completely positive @xcite . passing to isometric isomorphism classes one can show that this gives a groupoid : the @xmath0-picard groupoid @xmath88 and the strong picard groupoid @xmath89 , respectively . in particular , the local unit at @xmath12",
    "is given by the isometric isomorphism class of @xmath25 equipped with the inner products @xmath90 more generally , @xmath91 , viewed as @xmath92)-bimodule equipped with the canonical inner products @xmath93 implements the strong morita equivalence between @xmath12 and @xmath84 .",
    "since we simply can forget the additional structures we obtain canonical groupoid morphisms @xmath94      \\efig,\\ ] ] which have been studied in @xcite : in general , none of them is surjective nor injective , even on the level of the picard groups .",
    "the geometric interpretation of the inner products is that they correspond to _ hermitian fiber metrics _ on the corresponding line bundles or vector bundles , respectively : indeed , this can be seen easily from the very definitions . since up to isometry there is only one positive hermitian fiber metric on a given line bundle we have in the case of @xmath45 @xmath95    [ remark : weirdring ] in the approach of @xcite one main point was to replace the real numbers @xmath96 by an arbitrary _ ordered ring _ @xmath97 and @xmath79 by the ring extension @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "this allows to include also the formal star product algebras from deformation quantization into the game .",
    "they are defined as algebras over the formal power series @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "surprisingly , essentially all of the constructions involving positivity go through without problems .",
    "let us now pass to the covariant situation : we want to incorporate some given symmetry of the @xmath0-algebras in question .",
    "here we have two main motivations and examples from differential geometry : first , a smooth action @xmath101 of a lie group @xmath102 on @xmath2 , where by convention we choose a right action in order to have a left action @xmath103 on @xmath1 by @xmath0-automorphisms .",
    "second , as infinitesimal version of @xmath104 , a lie algebra action , i.e. a lie algebra homomorphism @xmath105 from a real finite dimensional lie algebra @xmath106 into the lie algebra of real vector fields , which correspond to the @xmath0-derivations of @xmath1 .    in order to formalize and unify both situations",
    "it is advantageous to consider hopf @xmath0-algebras and their actions on algebras .",
    "thus let @xmath107 be a _",
    "hopf @xmath0-algebra _ ,",
    "i.e. a unital @xmath0-algebra with a coassociative coproduct @xmath108 , a counit @xmath109 and an antipode @xmath110 such that @xmath111 as well as @xmath112 are @xmath0-homomorphisms and @xmath113 for all @xmath114 , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "iv.8 ) . for the coproduct we shall use sweedler s notation @xmath115 .",
    "the two geometric examples we want to discuss are now encoded in the following hopf @xmath0-algebras :    first , recall that any group @xmath102 defines its group algebra @xmath116 $ ] which becomes a hopf @xmath0-algebra by setting @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath120 $ ] . in this case",
    "@xmath121 $ ] is even _ cocommutative _ , i.e. @xmath122 where the opposite coproduct is defined by @xmath123 .",
    "second , for any real lie algebra the complexified universal enveloping algebra @xmath124 becomes a hopf @xmath0-algebra by setting @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 together with the resulting extensions to all of @xmath128 .",
    "again , @xmath129 is cocommutative .",
    "the situation that a group @xmath102 acts by @xmath0-automorphisms on a @xmath0-algebra as well as a lie algebra representation by @xmath0-derivations can be unified in terms of hopf @xmath0-algebras as follows : a _ @xmath0-action _ @xmath130 of @xmath107 on @xmath12 is a bilinear map @xmath131 such that @xmath132 and @xmath133 , i.e. @xmath12 is a left @xmath107-module , and @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 for all @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "then it is well - known and easy to see that for our two examples @xmath116 $ ] and @xmath129 this indeed generalizes and unifies the action by @xmath0-automorphisms and @xmath0-derivations , respectively .",
    "the interesting relations are all encoded in the different coproducts .    in principle and",
    "probably even more naturally , one should consider coactions instead of actions of @xmath107 , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , we stick to the more intuitive point of view where @xmath107 ` acts ' .    now suppose we have @xmath0-algebras @xmath12 , @xmath13 with a @xmath0-action of @xmath107 .",
    "let furthermore @xmath16 be a strong or @xmath0-morita equivalence bimodule .",
    "then we call the bimodule _ @xmath107-covariant _ if there is an @xmath107-module structure on @xmath15 denoted by @xmath130 , too , such that we have the following compatibilities @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 for all @xmath143 , @xmath43 , @xmath144 and @xmath137",
    ". of course , in the case of ring - theoretic morita theory one only requires and . taking isometric isomorphism classes also respecting the action of @xmath107 gives the @xmath107-covariant flavours of the picard groupoids , denoted by @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , respectively . since we can successively forget the additional structures we get the following commuting diagram of canonical groupoid morphisms : @xmath148      \\vtriangle(0,0)/@{>}|\\hole`>`>/<500,200>[{\\sideset{}{^{\\mathrm{str}}}{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{pic}}}}`{\\sideset{}{^*}{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{pic}}}},`{\\operatorname{\\mathsf{pic } } } ; `` ]      \\morphism(0,525)<0,-250 > [ ` ; ]      \\morphism(500,325)<0,-250 > [ ` ; ]      \\morphism(1000,525)<0,-250 > [ ` ; ]      \\efig\\ ] ]",
    "now let us interpret the diagram on the level of picard groups and in our geometric situation : let e.g. @xmath149 and @xmath45 be as before , equipped with an action of @xmath106 by @xmath0-derivations .",
    "then the kernel and the image of the group morphism @xmath150 encodes on which line bundles we can _ lift _ the @xmath106-action and if so , in how many different ways up to isomorphism .",
    "analogously , in the strong situation one requires in addition compatibility with the hermitian fiber metric .",
    "the case of @xmath151 $ ] leads to the question of existence and uniqueness of liftings of the group action on @xmath2 to a group action on @xmath152 by vector bundle automorphisms . in the strong case one requires the lift in addition to be unitary with respect to the fiber metric .",
    "all this can easily be seen from the compatibility requirements , , , and applied to our situation .",
    "clearly , all these lifting problems are very natural questions in differential geometry and have been discussed by various authors , see in particular @xcite , whence one can rely on the techniques developed there .",
    "even though our approach does not give essential new techniques to attack the ( in general quite difficult ) lifting problem , it shines some new light on it and unreveals some additional structure of the problem , namely the groupoid structures together with the canonical groupoid morphisms  .",
    "moreover , this point of view embeds the lifting problem in some larger and completely algebraic context since neither the @xmath0-algebras have to be commutative nor has the hopf @xmath0-algebra to be cocommutative . as remarked already , we can even replace @xmath96 and @xmath79 by @xmath97 and @xmath153 , respectively , and incorporate in particular the formal star product algebras from deformation quantization as well .",
    "in this last section we consider the case of @xmath154 more closely and develop some general results from @xcite slightly further .",
    "assume that @xmath16 is a @xmath0-morita equivalence bimodule which allows for a lift of the actions of @xmath107 on @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "then it was shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm  4.14 ) in full generality that the possible lifts are parametrized by the following group @xmath155 :    we consider linear maps @xmath156 with the usual convolution product given by @xmath157 .",
    "this makes @xmath156 an associative algebra with unit @xmath158 , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "then we consider the following conditions for @xmath159 @xmath160 @xmath161 @xmath162 @xmath163 then @xmath155 is defined to be the subset of those @xmath159 which satisfy  and it turns out that @xmath155 is a group with respect to the convolution product ( * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , for unitary central elements @xmath164 one defines @xmath165 by @xmath166 .",
    "then one obtains the exact sequence @xmath167 and the image @xmath168 is a central and hence normal subgroup .",
    "thus we can define the group @xmath169 .",
    "the parametrization of all possible lifts is obtained by a free and transitive group action @xmath170 of @xmath171 on the set of lifts given by @xmath172 where @xmath173 , @xmath114 and @xmath174 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath107-covariantly @xmath0-morita equivalent algebras @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 we have @xmath175 .",
    "moreover , @xmath176 and @xmath130 give isomorphic actions iff @xmath177 for some @xmath178 whence the isomorphism classes of lifts are parametrized by the group @xmath179 which acts freely and transitively via on the isomorphism classes of lifts .    while the above characterization works in full generality",
    "we want to specialize now to lie algebra actions where @xmath154 .",
    "first , it follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "a.7 ) that @xmath180 and hence @xmath181 since @xmath129 is cocommutative .",
    "thus the values of @xmath182 are automatically central , essentially by .",
    "moreover , the groups @xmath183 and @xmath184 are abelian . since the center @xmath185 is invariant under the @xmath106-action ( by derivations ! ) we can restrict @xmath186 to @xmath187 and obtain a chevalley - eilenberg cochain @xmath188 . evaluating the conditions , and on elements @xmath189",
    "we find by a simple computation the following lemma :        conversely , given @xmath191 we can construct an element @xmath192 with @xmath193 : let @xmath194 denote the @xmath195-th complexified tensor power of @xmath106 and define @xmath196 inductively by @xmath197 where @xmath198 . then a lenghty but straightforward computation using @xmath199 shows that @xmath200 passes to the universal enveloping algebra @xmath129 , viewed as a quotient of @xmath201 in the usual way , and fulfills to .",
    "thus we have :      note that this is in some sense surprising as the condition for @xmath202 to be a cocycle is linear while the condition for @xmath203 is highly _ non - linear_. it only becomes linear when evaluated on @xmath204 thanks to the fact that these elements are primitive , i.e. satisfy @xmath125",
    ". thus a simplification like in theorem  [ theorem : iso ] can not be expected for more non - trivial hopf @xmath0-algebras .",
    "moreover , under the identification the elements @xmath205 give just the cocycles @xmath206 as usual .",
    "note that in general @xmath207 are _ not _ ce - coboundaries .",
    "thus , if we want to relate @xmath184 to lie algebra cohomology we have to assume an additional structure for @xmath12 :              the first trivial observation is that for @xmath218 we have @xmath219 and for @xmath220 we clearly have @xmath221 .",
    "thus in this case @xmath222 contains all anti hermitian ce - coboundaries in @xmath223 .",

    "however , for @xmath45 we obtain indeed the @xmath226-integral first de rham cohomology of @xmath2 by the right hand side of which motivates our notation . since @xmath224 is mapped via @xmath227 into the cocycles @xmath223 and @xmath228 gives the coboundaries via we obtain a well - defined induced map @xmath229 collecting all the results we obtain the following statement :      in particular , this applies to @xmath45 whence we obtain the full classification of the inequivalent lifts of the lie algebra action to line bundles . note that in general , @xmath184 does not depend on the line bundle itself but is universal for all line bundles"
