    "the cavity output path branches at a polarizing beamsplitter into two measurement paths , and the detection efficiencies of these paths are unequal .",

    "while a photon is detected in 5.7% of sequences , the atom is always measured .",
    "correlations of the photon polarization and the atomic state are the input for maximum likelihood reconstruction of the most likely states@xcite .",

    "the phase of the entangled atom - photon state is inferred from the measurements of photon polarization and atomic - state phase . in the experiments of refs.@xcite , although the phase of the entangled state is time independent before photon detection , the phase of the atomic state after photon detection evolves due to larmor precession .",
    "it is thus necessary to fix the time between photon detection and atomic state readout in order to measure the same @xmath40 for all realizations of the experiment .",
    "in contrast , for the case of raman fields @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the correct choice of frequency @xmath78 means that both the phase of the entangled atom - photon state before photon detection and the phase of the atomic state after photon detection are independent of photon - detection time .",
    "we define a model system with bases @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the photon number in either of the two degenerate cavity modes .",
    "the excited state has been adiabatically eliminated , so that @xmath81 couples @xmath82 to @xmath83 and @xmath84 couples @xmath82 to @xmath85 .",
    "after transformation into a rotating frame @xmath86 , the hamiltonian is @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 are the state frequencies , @xmath90 is the cavity frequency , and terms rotating at @xmath91 are omitted@xcite . in this frame , the couplings @xmath92 are time - independent , and the states @xmath25 and @xmath26 are degenerate .",
    "therefore , the phase between @xmath83 and @xmath85 remains fixed during raman transfer , and the phase between @xmath93 and @xmath94 stays constant after photon detection .",
    "the cavity mirrors have transmission @xmath95  ppm and @xmath96  ppm , with combined losses of 68 ppm .",
    "state - of - the - art combined losses at this wavelength are @xmath97  ppm@xcite . in our cavity , these losses would correspond to an output coupling efficiency of @xmath98% . to improve this efficiency ,",
    "an output mirror with higher transmission @xmath99 could be used ; for example , @xmath100  ppm corresponds to an efficiency of 99% .",
    "the cavity decay rate @xmath5 would also increase , but single - photon generation with near - unit efficiency is valid in the bad - cavity regime@xcite ."
