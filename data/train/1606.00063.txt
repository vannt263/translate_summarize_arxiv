    "the work to be presented in this article lies at the boundary between physics and electrical engineering and aims at the experimental implementation of practical hardware technology for quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "at this point in time , one of the main objectives in the quantum computing community is to build and prototype tools for scalable architectures that may lead to the realization of a universal quantum computer  @xcite . in this project",
    ", we undertake the task of implementing an extensible wiring method for the operation of a quantum processor based on solid - state devices , e.g. , superconducting qubits  @xcite .",
    "possible experimental solutions based on wafer bonding techniques  @xcite or coaxial through - silicon vias  @xcite as well as theoretical proposals  @xcite have recently addressed the wiring issue , highlighting it as a priority for quantum computing .",
    "building a universal quantum computer  @xcite will make it possible to execute quantum algorithms  @xcite , which would have profound implications on scientific research and society . for a quantum computer to be competitive with the most advanced classical computer",
    ", it is widely believed that the qubit operations will require error rates on the order of  @xmath2 or less .",
    "achieving such error rates is only possible by means of quantum error correction ( qec ) algorithms  @xcite , which allow for the implementation of fault tolerant operations between logical qubits .",
    "a logical qubit is realized as an ensemble of a large number of physical qubits ( on the order  @xmath3 or larger ) , where each physical qubit behaves as an effective quantum - mechanical two - level system .    among various qec algorithms ,",
    "the most practical at present is the surface code algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the surface code requires only nearest - neighbor interactions between physical qubits on a two - dimensional lattice , one- and two - qubit physical gates , and qubit measurement with error rates below approximately  @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "both fast gates and measurements are indispensable to run quantum algorithms efficiently ; execution times on the order of tens of nanoseconds for physical operations ( e.g. , a gate or measurement operation ) are highly desirable and represent the state - of - the - art in qubit technology today . under these conditions , to factorize a  @xmath5-bit number using shor s algorithm  @xcite requires more than  @xmath6 million physical qubits ( i.e. , approximately  @xmath7 logical qubits storing meaningful data ; note that these logical qubits occupy less than   of the quantum computer , the remainder of which is used to generate special states facilitating computation ) , with an overall computation time of  @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "quantum computing architectures can be implemented using photons  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , spins in molecules  @xcite and quantum dots  @xcite , spins in silicon  @xcite , and superconducting quantum circuits  @xcite .",
    "the last are leading the way for the realization of the first surface code logical qubit , which is one of the priorities in the quantum computing community at present . recently",
    ", several experiments based on superconducting quantum circuits have demonstrated the principles underlying the surface code .",
    "these works have shown a complete set of physical gates with fidelities beyond the surface code threshold  @xcite , the parity measurements necessary to detect quantum errors  @xcite , and have realized a classical version of the surface code on a one - dimensional array of nine physical qubits  @xcite .",
    "notably , the planar design inherent to the superconducting qubit platform will make it possible to implement large two - dimensional qubit arrays , as required by the surface code .    despite all these accomplishments ,",
    "a truly scalable qubit architecture has yet to be demonstrated .",
    "wiring is one of the most basic unsolved scalability issues common to most solid - state qubit implementations , where qubit arrays are fabricated on a chip .",
    "the conventional wiring method based on wire bonding suffers from fundamental scaling limitations as well as mechanical and electrical restrictions .",
    "wire bonding relies on bonding pads located at the edges of the chip .",
    "given a two - dimensional lattice of  @xmath8 physical qubits on a square chip , the number of wire bonds that can be placed scales approximately as  @xmath9 ( @xmath10 bonds for each chip side ) .",
    "wire bonding will thus never be able to reach the required  @xmath11 law according to which physical qubits scale on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "furthermore , for large  @xmath10 , wire bonding precludes the possibility of accessing physical qubits in the center region of the chip , which is unacceptable for a physical implementation of the surface code . in the case of superconducting qubits , for example , qubit control and measurement are typically realized by means of microwave pulses or , in general , pulses requiring large frequency bandwidths . by their nature",
    ", these pulses can not be reliably transmitted through long sections of quasi - filiform wire bonds .",
    "in fact , stray capacitances and inductances associated with wire bonds as well as the self - inductance of the bond itself limit the available frequency bandwidth , thus compromising the integrity of the control and measurement signals  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the placement of wire bonds is prone to errors and inconsistency in spacing  .    in this work",
    ", we set out to solve the wiring bottleneck common to almost all solid - state qubit implementations .",
    "our solution is based on suitably packaged _ three - dimensional micro wires _ that can reach any area on a given chip from above .",
    "we define this wiring system as the _ quantum socket_. the wires are coaxial structures consisting of a spring - loaded inner and outer conductor with diameters of   and , respectively , at the smallest point and with a maximum outer diameter of  .",
    "the movable section of the wire is characterized by a maximum stroke of approximately  , allowing for a wide range of on - chip mechanical compression .",
    "all wire components are non magnetic , thereby minimizing any interference with the qubits .",
    "the three - dimensional wires work both at room temperature and at cryogenic temperatures as low as  @xmath0 .",
    "the wires test - retest reliability is excellent , with marginal variability over hundreds of measurements .",
    "their electrical performance is good from dc to at least  , with a contact resistance smaller than   and an instantaneous impedance mismatch of approximately  .",
    "notably , the coaxial design of the wires strongly reduces unwanted crosstalk , which we measured to be at most   for a realistic quantum computing application .    in a recent work  @xcite ,",
    "seven sequential stages necessary to the development of a quantum computer were introduced . at this time , the next stage to be reached is the implementation of a single logical qubit characterized by an error rate that is at least one order of magnitude lower than that of the underlying physical qubits . in order to achieve this task , a two - dimensional lattice of  @xmath1 physical qubits with an error rate of at most  @xmath12 is required  @xcite . in the case of superconducting qubits",
    "such a lattice can be realized on a chip area of  @xmath13 ( the largest square that can be diced from a standard @xmath14  inch wafer ) and wired by means of a quantum socket .",
    "it is feasible to further miniaturize the three - dimensional wires so as to achieve a wire density of  .",
    "this would allow the manipulation of  @xmath15 physical qubits and , possibly , the realization of simple fault tolerant operations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the wires could serve as interconnect between a quantum hardware layer fabricated on one chip and a classical hardware layer realized on a separate chip , just above the quantum layer .",
    "the classical hardware would be used to manipulate the qubits and could be implemented by means of rapid single - flux - quantum  ( rsfq ) digital circuitry  @xcite .",
    "the implications of our cryogenic micro - wiring method go beyond quantum computing applications , providing a useful addition to the packaging industry for research applications at low temperatures . with this work ,",
    "we demonstrate that the laborious and error - prone wire bonding technique can be substituted by the simple procedure of inserting the chip into a sample box equipped with three - dimensional wires .",
    "our concept will expedite sample packaging and , thus , experiment turn over even for research not directly related to quantum information .",

    "we first focus on a four - port measurement used to estimate a wire contact resistance ( cf .",

    "[ conclusions ] , we envision an extensible quantum computing architecture where a quantum socket is used to connect to a  @xmath1 lattice of superconducting qubits and comment on the possibility to use the socket in conjunction with rsfq electronics .",
    "the development of the quantum socket required a stage of meticulous micro - mechanical and microwave design and simulations .",
    "it was determined that a spring - loaded interconnect  the three - dimensional wire  was the optimal method to electrically access devices lithographically fabricated on a chip and operated in a cryogenic environment .",
    "an on - chip contact pad geometrically and electrically matched to the bottom interface of the wire can be placed easily at any desired location on the chip as part of the fabrication process , thus making it possible to reach any point on a two - dimensional lattice of qubits .",
    "the contact pad is realized as a thin metallic film deposited on a dielectric substrate ; arbitrary film thicknesses can be deposited .",
    "the rest of the sample is fabricated on chip following a similar process .",
    "the coaxial design of the wire provides a wide operating frequency bandwidth , while the springs allow for mechanical stress relief during the cooling process .",
    "the three - dimensional wires used in this work take advantage of the knowledge in the existing field of microwave circuit testing  @xcite . however , reducing the wire dimensions to a few hundred micrometers and using it to connect to quantum - mechanical micro - fabricated circuits at low temperatures resulted in a significant extension of existing implementations and applications .    in this section , we will describe the design of the three - dimensional wires , of the microwave package used to house the wires , and of the microwave package holder .",

    "the coaxial design of the wire is visible from the image , which features a wire   long when uncompressed .",
    "the wire is characterized by an inner cylindrical pin of diameter   and an outer cylindrical body ( the electrical ground ) of diameter   at its narrowest region ; this region is the bottommost section of the wire and , hereafter , will be referred to as the wire _ contact head _ ( cf .  the inset of fig .  [ figure01:bejanin ]  ( a ) , as well as the dashed box on the left of fig .  [ figure02:bejanin ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "the contact head terminates at the wire _",
    "bottom interface _ ; this interface is designed to mate with a pad on a chip ( cf .",
    "[ figure02:bejanin ]  ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "the outer body includes a rectangular aperture , the _ tunnel _ , to prevent shorting the inner conductor of an on - chip coplanar waveguide  ( cpw ) transmission line  @xcite ; the transmission line can connect the pad with any other structure on the chip .",
    "two different tunnel dimensions were designed , with the largest one reducing potential alignment errors .",
    "these errors can result in undesired short - circuit connections to ground .",
    "the tunnel height was   in both cases , with a width of   or .",
    "the internal spring mechanisms of the wire allow the contact head to be compressed ; the maximum stroke was designed to be  , corresponding to a working stroke of  .",
    "the outer body of the three - dimensional wire is an  m@xmath16 male thread used to fix the wire to the lid of the microwave package ( cf .",
    "[ figure01:bejanin ]  ( b ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "the thread is split into two segments of length   and that are separated by a constriction with outer diameter  .",
    "the constriction is necessary to assemble and maintain in place the inner components of the three - dimensional wire .",
    "a laser - printed marker is engraved into the top of the outer body .",
    "the marker is aligned with the center of the tunnel , making it possible to mate the wire bottom interface with a pad on the underlying chip with a high degree of angular precision .",
    "the grooves partially visible on the bottom of fig .",
    "[ figure01:bejanin ]  ( a ) are used to torque the wire into a   thread in the package s lid .",
    "figure  [ figure02:bejanin ]  ( a ) shows a lateral two - dimensional cut view of the three - dimensional wire .",
    "two of the main wire components are the inner and outer barrel , which compose part of the inner and outer conductor .",
    "the inner conductor barrel is a hollow cylinder with outer and inner diameters of   and ( indicated as part  iv in fig .  [ figure02:bejanin ]  ( a ) ) , respectively .",
    "this barrel encapsulates the inner conductor spring . the outer conductor barrel is a hollow cylinder as well , in this case with an inner diameter of   ( parts  ii and vii ) .",
    "three polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) disks serve as spacers between the inner and outer conductor ; such disks contribute marginally to the wire dielectric volume , the majority of which is air or vacuum . the outer spring is housed within the outer barrel towards its back end , just before the last ptfe disk on the right - hand side of the wire .",
    "the _ back end _ of the wire is a region comprising a female thread on the outer conductor and an inner conductor barrel ( cf .",

    "[ figure02:bejanin ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "the inner conductor tip is characterized by a conical geometry with an opening angle of  @xmath17 .",
    "such a sharp design was chosen to ensure that the tip would pierce through any possible oxide layer forming on the contact pad metallic surface , thus allowing for a good electrical contact .",
    "figure  [ figure02:bejanin ]  ( c ) shows the design of a typical on - chip pad used to make contact with the bottom interface of a three - dimensional wire .",
    "the pad comprises an inner and outer conductor , with the outer conductor being grounded .",
    "the pad in the figure was designed for a silver  ( ag ) film of thickness  .",
    "a variety of similar pads were designed for gold  ( au ) and al films with thickness ranging between approximately   and .",
    "the pad inner conductor is a circle with diameter   that narrows to a linear trace ( i.e. , the inner conductor of a cpw transmission line ) by means of a raised - cosine taper .",
    "the raised cosine makes it possible to maximize the pad area , while minimizing impedance mismatch .",
    "as designed , the wire and pad allow for lateral and rotational misalignment of  @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the substrate underneath the pad is assumed to be silicon  ( si ) with a relative permittivity  @xmath20 .",
    "the dielectric gap between the inner and outer conductor is   in the circular region of the pad ; the outer edge of the dielectric gap then follows a similar raised - cosine taper as the inner conductor .",
    "the pad characteristic impedance is designed to be  @xmath21 .",
    "the microwave package comprises three main parts : the lid ; the sample holder ; the grounding washer .",
    "the package is a parallelepiped with a height of   and with a square base of side length  .",
    "the chip is housed inside the sample holder .",
    "all these components mate as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure01:bejanin ]  ( b ) and ( c ) .    in order to connect a three - dimensional wire to a device on a chip , the wire is screwed into an  m@xmath16 female thread that is tapped into the lid of the microwave package , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure01:bejanin ]  ( b ) .",

    "the lid is designed to hold a set of six three - dimensional wires , which are arranged in two parallel rows . in each row , the wires are spaced by   from center to center , with the two rows being separated by a distance of  .",

    "hereafter , those lips will be referred to as the _ chip recess_. for design purposes , a chip thickness of   is assumed .",
    "correspondingly , the chip recess is designed so that the top of the chip is   above the adjacent surface of the chip holder , i.e. , the depth of the recess is   ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ figure01:bejanin ]  ( c ) ) .",
    "the outer edges of the chip are pushed on by a spring - loaded grounding washer .",
    "the   chip protrusion ensures a good electrical connection between chip and washer , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure01:bejanin ]  ( c ) .",
    "the grounding washer was designed to substitute the large number of lateral bonding wires that would otherwise be required to provide a good ground to the chip ( as shown , for example , in fig .",

    "the four feet of the washer , which can be seen in the cut view of fig .",

    "a channel with a cross - sectional area of  @xmath25 connects the inner cavities of the package to the outside , thus making it possible to evacuate the inner compartments of the package .",
    "this channel meanders to prevent external electromagnetic radiation from interfering with the sample .",
    "the three - dimensional wires , which are screwed into the microwave package , must be connected to the qubit control and measurement electronics .",
    "in addition , for cryogenic applications , the package must be thermally anchored to a refrigeration system in order to be cooled to the desired temperature .",

    "the other end of the micro connector is soldered to a coaxial cable .",
    "the micro connector is necessary because the high temperatures generated by soldering a coaxial cable directly to the wire back end would damage some of the inner wire components  .",
    "the end of each coaxial cable opposite to the three - dimensional wire is soldered to a sub - miniature push - on  ( smp ) connector .",
    "the smp connectors are bolted to a horizontal plate attached to the microwave package by means of two vertical fixtures , as shown in fig .",

    "the mounting plate is mechanically and , thus , thermally anchored to the mixing chamber  ( mc ) stage of a dilution refrigerator  ( dr ) .",
    "this design significantly simplifies the typical mounting procedure of a sample box to a cryostat , since the package holder and microwave package can be conveniently assembled remotely from the dr and attached to it just prior to commencing an experiment .",
    "the three - dimensional wires , the   transition between the wire and the on - chip pad as well as the inner cavities of the fully - assembled microwave package were extensively simulated by means of the high frequency three - dimensional full - wave electromagnetic field simulation software  ( hfss ) by ansys , inc .",

    "superconducting : resonators : coupling : and : fit ] , we discuss in detail the geometry of the coupling region between a cpw transmission line and a superconducting resonator ; additionally , we show the fit required to extract the internal quality factor of the resonators . in sec .",
    "[ spring : tests ] , we present a movie of the cryogenic spring tests . in sec .",
    "[ quantum : socket : surface : code ] , we propose a surface code architecture that makes use of two readout resonators per qubit . finally , in sec .",
    "[ microwave : pulse : transmission ] , we present the quantum socket behavior when fast microwave pulses are applied .",
    "the electric fields discussed in subsec .",
    "ii  d of the main text were generated for multiple phases , enabling a time - domain analysis .",
    "this made it possible to better determine the behavior of the simulated fields associated with the various components of the quantum socket .",
    "the time - domain animations of the simulated electric field for the three - dimensional wire , the   transition between the wire and the on - chip pad , and the first box mode are shown in movies  1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "the simulation of the three - dimensional wire shows a clear impact to the electric field at the dielectric spacers , giving an indication of where potential future improvements of the wire should focus .",
    "the simulation of the   transition reveals a surprisingly clean transmission , with no immediately apparent regions of poor performance .",
    "the broad field distribution below the contact pad does suggest the appearance of a stray capacitance to the cavity below . however , the tdr results in subsec .",
    "iv  c indicate that such a capacitance must be small because of a very good impedance matching at the transition region .",
    "the box mode animation shows the `` pinching '' effect to the electric field caused by the metallic pillar , leading to a significantly higher relative permittivity and , in turn , a much lower frequency of the first box mode ( @xmath373 ) .",
    "some other regions of interest in movie  3 are the outer edges of the chip recess , where the field becomes fully confined within the substrate .",
    "as the magnitude of the field in this region is quite low , this effect should have only a marginal impact on the performance of the quantum socket .",
    "the animation also reveals some field interaction between the box mode and the contact pads ( which are characterized by a relatively large area ) , suggesting these as the main reason for any spurious coupling between on - chip structures and box modes .",
    "; the black dashed lines delimit the frequency region between   and .",
    "the dip at approximately   corresponds to the loose micro - connector . ]    in order to gain further insight into the electrical behavior of the screw - in micro connector , we report here a set of room temperature measurements showing the appearance of a microwave anomaly associated with the micro connector .",
    "these measurements complement the discussion associated with fig .",

    "iv  b of the main text .",
    "figure  [ figure01s : bejanin ] shows the magnitude and unwrapped phase angle of the s - parameters as a function of frequency for an au sample in the case of a slightly loose screw - in micro connector ; the measurement was performed at room temperature ( cf .",
    "iv  b of the main text for details on the dut used for the measurements ) .",
    "the microwave dip is centered at approximately   and has a   bandwidth of approximately  .",
    "the dip is likely not a lorentzian - type feature due to a resonance mode in the package .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by the phase angle of the coefficients  @xmath165 and @xmath374 , which has the characteristic frequency dependence of a transmission line ( i.e. , no phase shift associated with a resonance ) .",
    "note that a similar behavior is encountered when performing a microwave measurement with , e.g. , a not well torqued sma connector .",
    "as expected from energy conservation , the dip in  @xmath165 corresponds to a peak in  @xmath375 ; however , the absence of a peak in  @xmath376 indicates that only the micro connector at the dut input line was loose in this instance . as explained in the main text ,",
    "curing the dip at room temperature is rather straightforward .",
    "however , it is much harder at low temperatures .",
    "hence , we decided to cool down a dut without curing the dip that appeared at room temperature .",
    "a set of data at   was taken immediately after the room temperature data , as shown in fig .",
    "9  ( b ) in subsec .",
    "iv  b of the main text .",
    "we monitored the s - parameters throughout the cooldown , observing how the dip shifted from approximately   to while cooling .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that , when cooling down , the micro connector became slightly more loose due to thermal contractions , thus giving rise to a microwave transmission dip at lower frequency .",

    "similarly , label  @xmath220 is associated with a cpw transmission line that is coupled to a set of four measurement resonators , all at slightly different frequencies centered around frequency  @xmath220 . in this architecture ,",
    "all qubits start at a low frequency then increase in frequency in unison to perform cz gates through the coupling resonators in the correct sequence ; in the figure , this sequence is indicated by the labels ( coupling frequencies ) @xmath386 , and @xmath14 .",
    "finally , the measurement qubits ( red and blue ) are readout at frequency  @xmath220 .",
    "this is one surface code cycle  @xcite .",
    "the process is then reversed and during the downward uniform frequency sweep again an appropriate sequence of cz interactions is executed , followed by readout at frequency  @xmath385 , implementing the next cycle .",
    "this process avoids sweeping either measurement or data qubits past resonators during the cycles .",

    "we describe a set of experiments where actual fast microwave pulses were applied to the quantum socket as well as a reference cable .",
    "this makes it possible to assess the effects of dispersion directly on pulses similar to those that will be used for the manipulation of superconducting qubits .",
