    "in the last few years there has been a growing interest in combining magnetotransport experiments based onto the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) in metallic magnetic multilayers with semiconductor physics @xcite .",
    "semiconductors offer various advantages over metals such as a very long spin - lifetime @xcite , persistent spin coherence @xcite , and compatibility with existing semiconductor processing technologies .",
    "these properties pave the way for using semiconductors as media for storing coherence and realizing elements for solid - state quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the natural extension of gmr to semiconductors is in a hybrid spin - valve where the magnetic elements are either magnetic metals or diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite and the non - magnetic elements are ordinary semiconductors . in both cases",
    "it is essential to inject spins into the non - magnetic semiconductors and this is a formidable challenge .",
    "so far spin - injection into semiconductors from metallic contacts has been elusive @xcite with gmr signals smaller than 1% @xcite .",
    "in contrast spin - injection from diluted magnetic semiconductors has been more successful and evidence of polarized currents either into iii - v @xcite and ii - vi @xcite semiconductors has been demonstrated . in both cases",
    "the polarization is observed by optical techniques , which makes the integration of such systems in present semiconductor technology very difficult and all electronic systems would be more technologically desirable .",
    "recently it has been suggested @xcite that a spin - valve with a conventional injector - detector geometry made by metallic contacts can not present large signals at equilibrium due to the very different resistivities of the contacts and the semiconductor spacer .",
    "much larger signals are predicted by using half - metallic contacts or diluted magnetic semiconductors .    from the point of view of the materials the system formed by gaas as non - magnetic semiconductor and by mnas and ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as",
    "respectively as magnetic metal and diluted magnetic semiconductor is the most promising for spintronics applications . for the metallic component in metal / semiconductor structures",
    ", mnas presents several advantages over transition metals .",
    "mnas grows epitaxially onto gaas in the hexagonal nias - type structure .",
    "this structure is characteristic of all bulk mnx compounds with x = as , sb and bi .",
    "high quality all - epitaxial mnas structures can be grown onto commonly used gaas @xcite and si @xcite . for mnas",
    "/ gaas the interfaces are thermodynamically stable since the materials share the as atoms and the growth process is completely compatible with existing iii - v mbe technology .",
    "another attractive prospective crystal structure for mnas is the zincblende structure .",
    "recent density functional calculations @xcite have shown that the latter , which can be obtained in principle in the limit of 100% doping from ga@xmath1mn@xmath0as , is a half - metal .",
    "this makes zincblende mnas very promising for spintronics because it will allow the intrinsic difficulty of injecting spins into semiconductors to be overcome @xcite .",
    "unfortunately to our knowledge zincblende mnas has never been successfully grown .    in this paper",
    "we investigate , by using density functional calculations , the stability of the nias - type mnas with respect to the hypothetical zincblende structure .",
    "in particular we look for growth conditions ( for example strains from the growing substrate , volume compressions ) which can enable the zincblende phase to be made .",
    "one of the main results of this analysis is that the zincblende structure can not be stabilized either by lattice stretching nor by compression .",
    "we also consider the magnetic properties of the nias - type mnas grown onto gaas with different crystalline orientations and lattice distortions .",
    "finally we look at the nature of the chemical bonding in zincblende mnas .",
    "this is particularly important since the tetrahedral coordination of the mn atoms is one of the key elements for understanding the properties of magnetic diluted iii - v semiconductors .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next sections we will briefly discuss the calculation technique and provide some information regarding the lattice structures considered and their properties .",
    "then we will move on to analyze the stability of the nias - type mnas under compression and distortion of the unit cell . in section v we will consider the zincblende structure and we will compare its structural properties with the nias - type . finally we will perform a fit onto a tight - binding model in order to analyze the details of the chemical bonding in zincblende mnas .",
    "we compute the electronic structure of mnas with both nias - type and zincblende lattice structures using a plane wave pseudopotential implementation of density functional theory @xcite with the local spin density approximation . the use of pseudopotentials for the study of magnetic systems , although not yet as popular as all electron methods , is now well documented @xcite .",
    "we use the optimized pseudopotentials developed by rappe _",
    "@xcite for our mn pseudopotential , allowing us to use a small cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion in the total energy calculation of the solid .",
    "this is achieved by minimizing the kinetic energy in the high fourier components of the pseudo wave function .",
    "the reference configuration for our mn is 4s@xmath34p@xmath43d@xmath5 with core radii of 2.0 , 2.15 and 2.0  a.u .",
    "and we use the usual kleinman - bylander separable form with two projectors for each angular momentum @xcite . for as we use the standard hamann - schlter - chiang pseudopotential @xcite with one projector for each angular momentum .",
    "the pseudopotentials were tested by comparing the pseudoeigenvalues with those generated by all electron calculations for several atomic and ionic configurations .",
    "we also checked the portability by calculating the equilibrium lattice constant of gaas and the dependence of the magnetization on the unit cell volume of hypothetical fcc mn .",
    "both are in excellent agreement with all electron calculations .",
    "moreover the mn pseudopotentials has been successfully used in earlier studies of perovskite manganites @xcite .",
    "total energy and band structure are calculated by using the code specter @xcite .",
    "this is a spin - polarized implementation of density functional theory written in c , which originated from the program castep 2.1 @xcite .",
    "the plane wave cutoff is fixed to 870  ev ( @xmath663  ry ) and we use a simple electron density mixing scheme for convergence developed by kerker @xcite with variable gaussian broadening between 0.8 and 10@xmath7 ev .",
    "we use a @xmath8 monkhorst - pack grid for the zincblende structure and a @xmath9 for the nias - type structure .",
    "this leads respectively to 10 and 6 @xmath10-points in the corresponding irreducible brillouin zones .",
    "stability of the results with respect to @xmath10-point sampling has been carefully checked and the present choice represents a good compromise between accuracy and computation time .",
    "the nias - type lattice structure is an hexagonal structure ( space group p@xmath11/mmc ) with 4 atoms in the primitive unit cell ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is the equilibrium lattice structure of the pnictides formed with mn at room temperature .",
    "bulk mnas has lattice constants of a=3.7  and c=5.7  and is a ferromagnetic metal with a t@xmath12 of 318k . above t@xmath12",
    "it undergoes a phase transition to a paramagnetic state involving also a structural change to the hexagonal mnp - type lattice structure ( space group pnma ) with a 2% volume reduction @xcite .",
    "a further structural phase transition back to the nias - type phase is observed at 398k with the material remaining paramagnetic .",
    "mnas can grow epitaxially onto gaas in several possible crystalline orientations with respect to the gaas substrate , depending on the growth conditions .",
    "in particular when mnas grows onto ( 001 ) gaas two orientations can occur @xcite .",
    "the first one , which is usually called type a , has growth plane ( @xmath13100 ) and epitaxial relationship [ @xmath1420]mnas@xmath15[110]gaas and [ 0001]mnas@xmath15[@xmath1310]gaas , while the second , known as type b , has growth planes ( @xmath13101 ) and ( @xmath13102 ) and epitaxial relationship [ @xmath1420]mnas@xmath15[@xmath1310]gaas and [ 1@xmath1320]mnas@xmath15[110]gaas",
    ". moreover mnas can be grown onto ( 111 ) gaas @xcite with growth direction along the c axis of the hexagonal cell and epitaxial relationship ( 0001)mnas@xmath15(111)gaas , [ @xmath13100]mnas@xmath15[11@xmath16gaas and [ @xmath17110]mnas@xmath15[1@xmath130]gaas .",
    "all these phases have the easy axis of magnetization along the c axis of the hexagonal cell . the saturation magnetizations ( m@xmath18 )",
    "are very different , being 416  emu/@xmath19 , 331  emu/@xmath19 @xcite and 640  emu/@xmath19 @xcite respectively for type a , type b and ( 111 ) gaas grown mnas . moreover for mnas mbe - deposited onto gaas the saturation magnetization depends on the number of monolayers deposited @xcite , suggesting that relaxation of the lattice has an important influence on the magnetic properties . in what follows",
    "we will show that these changes of the saturation magnetization can be correlated with distortions of the hexagonal unit cell resulting from matching to the substrate .",
    "bulk zincblende mnas is unstable , and zincblende structure thin films have not been demonstrated conclusively @xcite",
    ". however mn can be incorporated into epitaxial layers of gaas with concentrations beyond its solubility limit by using low temperature mbe techniques @xcite .",
    "the highest concentration obtained so far is @xmath20 for ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as , above which the mn atoms segregate forming clusters of mnas with nias - type structure .",
    "nevertheless the low concentration limit is reproducible .",
    "mn in gaas acts both as a source of localized spin and also as an acceptor , providing electrical carriers ( holes ) .",
    "( ga , mn)as is ferromagnetic for concentration above @xmath21 although the origin of the ferromagnetism is still a matter of debate . in section v we will study the limit of @xmath2 in order to understand the nature of the chemical bond of mn tetrahedrally coordinated with as .",
    "in this section we look at the magnetic properties and structural stability of the nias - type phase . in figure [ fig2 ] we present the band structure for ferromagnetic mnas with lattice parameter corresponding to the experimental bulk values ( a=3.7  c=5.7  ) .",
    "the two lower bands correspond to the 4s states of as and the following 16 to hybridized p - d bands .",
    "this band structure is characteristic of all the mn - based pnictides @xcite and we can identify three distinct regions : i ) a low energy p - d bonding region ( between -6 and -2.5  ev for the majority band and between -6 and 0  ev for the minority ) , ii ) an almost dispersionless intermediate region ( @xmath6 - 2.0 for the majority and @xmath22 for the majority band ) and iii ) a high energy p - d antibonding region ( between -1.5 and 3  ev for the majority band and between 1.5 and 4  ev for the minority ) . the ferromagnetism is mostly due to the spin - splitting of the degenerate d bands , although a rigid shift model can not be applied due to the strong p - d interaction .",
    "we will see in the next section that p - d interaction is also very strong in the zincblende structure .",
    "= 7.0 cm    turning our attention to the structural properties we calculate the total energy and the magnetic moment per mnas pair as a function of the volume occupied by a pair of atoms .",
    "we fix the ratio between the hexagonal axes to c / a=1.54 , which corresponds to the experimental value for bulk mnas .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "= 6.5 cm    our calculated equilibrium volume is 31.123  @xmath23 which is slightly smaller than the experimental one of 33.789  @xmath23 .",
    "this small discrepancy can be explained by a general tendency of the lda to underestimate the equilibrium volume .",
    "we also note that the structure is very stable with respect to compression and expansion of the unit cell around the equilibrium value ( volume changes of the order of 50% give energy changes of approximately 1  ev ) .",
    "our calculated magnetization @xmath24 at equilibrium is between 2.5 and @xmath25 which is smaller than that found experimentally ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "nevertheless it is notable that the magnetization is very sensitive to the volume around the equilibrium position , and small volume changes can produce large changes in the magnetization . for large compressions",
    "the system evolves to a paramagnetic state .",
    "this transition is not directly comparable with experiments on mnas under pressure @xcite since a structural transition to the mnp - type structure and a magnetic transition to a mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase are experimentally observed for pressures above 4  kbar . in contrast , for volumes larger than the equilibrium volume we observe a saturation of the magnetic moment per mnas pair to a value around 4@xmath27 .",
    "this saturation can be understood by comparing the band structures of fig.[fig2 ] with those obtained for an expanded structure ( a=4.3 c=6.62with a volume per mnas pair of 53.03@xmath23 ) presented in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "first we observe that there is a large shrinking of the mn d bands without a drastic change of their centers with respect to the fermi energy . as a result of the strong p - d interaction the minority p bands below the fermi energy",
    "are pushed to higher energies , while the majority p bands above the fermi energy are pulled to lower energy .",
    "this increases the number of occupied majority states and decreases the occupation of minority states resulting in a global increase in the magnetic moment of the system .",
    "= 7.0 cm    the saturation of the magnetization to a value of @xmath28 can be explained by considering charge transfer from mn to as .",
    "three electrons will be transferred from each mn to a neighboring as in order to fill completely the electronegative as atoms 4p shell .",
    "this leads to an atomic configuration of mn with four electrons in the valence , which arrange themself following hund s rules and produce a magnetic moment of 4@xmath27 .",
    "the charge transfer is not complete for unit cell volume corresponding to the experimental value because of the strong p - d interaction .",
    "this p - d interaction in fact leads also to a quite large negative polarization of the anions ( -0.23@xmath290.05@xmath27 ) , which has been observed with neutron scattering @xcite . for stretched unit cells ,",
    "the p - d hybridation is reduced and a more ionic configuration is resumed .",
    "we finally look at the magnetization and the total energy of distorted cells .",
    "we consider cells with a volume equal to that of bulk mnas and calculate the energy and the magnetization as a function of the cell aspect ratio c / a .",
    "our results are presented in fig.[fig5 ]    = 6.5 cm = 7.5 cm    several interesting aspects must be pointed out . first note",
    "that the energy scale is much smaller than that of fig.[fig3 ] . the total energy for aspect ratios from 1.4 to 1.7 changes only by 0.25  mev ( which is equal to @xmath30 at room temperature ) .",
    "by comparing figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] one can conclude that nias - type mnas can accommodate large distortions , which are much less energy demanding than volume changes .",
    "this can be easily understood by using a simple geometrical argument .",
    "consider the nearest neighbor distance d@xmath31 as a function of the lattice constant a for fixed cell volume @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the volume occupied by a mn - as pair .",
    "it clear that d@xmath31 is non - monotonic with a minimum at @xmath34 , which is 3.629  in the case of bulk mnas .",
    "moreover d@xmath31 does not vary much with the lattice constant a around this minimum . for c / a increasing from 1.3 to 1.8 , a increases by about 10% while d@xmath31 increases by @xmath35% . since the total energy does not vary considerably as a function of the mn - as bond angle but only as a function of its bond length",
    ", we can conclude that the mn - as bond is largely ionic and dominates the total energy .",
    "in fact for the lattice distortions considered the second nearest neighbor distances ( as - as and mn - mn ) change drastically , while the first nearest neighbor distance ( mn - as ) is almost constant .",
    "this produces no appreciable change in the total energy suggesting that the latter is dominated only by the mn - as bond .",
    "moreover because of the absence of any strong angular dependence we can also conclude that the mn - as has a large ionic component .",
    "our calculated tiny energy variation for even large distortions , combined with the large change in magnetization at small distortions explain most of the properties of the different epitaxial orientations of mnas onto gaas .",
    "in fact it is worth noting that a large change of the magnetization occurs for ratios c / a just above the one corresponding to the bulk .",
    "the magnetization passes from a high magnetization region c / a@xmath361.54 to a low magnetization region c / a@xmath371.54 .",
    "this is very important since large changes of the magnetization have been observed in mnas grown onto gaas with different crystalline orientations ( type a , type b and mnas onto ( 111 ) gaas ) .",
    "it is difficult to correlate directly the deformation of the cell with the magnetization observed in experiments since a complicated surface reconstruction occurs @xcite and a detailed characterization is not easy .",
    "we do not want to go into details of this intricate issue and we only suggest that the reduction of the magnetization of mnas grown onto gaas may be due to large deformation of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "we now consider mnas with the zincblende lattice structure . in fig.[fig6 ] we present the total energy as a function of the lattice constant for mnas and also compare the total energy of the same structure when the magnetic moment is fixed either to 0@xmath27 ( paramagnetic phase ) and to 4@xmath27 ( half - metallic phase ) .",
    "the equilibrium lattice constant is found between 5.6  and 5.7  which is very similar to the lattice constant of gaas .",
    "such a value is smaller ( as we would expect within the lda ) than that predicted from the linear extrapolation of the experimental lattice constant of ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as for @xmath38 ( 5.89 ) @xcite .",
    "it is also smaller than another lda result obtained with the flapw method ( 5.9 ) @xcite .",
    "this could be due to the pseudopotential method used here or differences in convergence or sampling between the two calculations .",
    "we also notice that the paramagnetic phase becomes energetically favorable for a=5.0 , where a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition is predicted .",
    "in contrast , for lattice spacings larger than 5.8  a transition to an half - metallic state is predicted .",
    "this is a very important result since half - metallicity is one of the conditions required to obtain large signals in a semiconductor spin - valve @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization as a function of the unit cell volume is summarized in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "we notice that fig.[fig7 ] looks similar to its counterpart for the nias - type structure ( fig.[fig3 ] ) although in the latter no transition to an half - metallic state is found .",
    "this fundamental difference between the two structures can be understood by looking at the band structure of zincblende mnas in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "we first note that , excluding the presence of the mn d bands , the bandstructure closely resembles that of the non - magnetic iii - v semiconductors .",
    "consider the majority bands first . by symmetry analysis",
    "we can easily identify the lower lying as s states ( lowest band , @xmath39 at the @xmath40 point ) , the as p valence band ( first @xmath41 point above @xmath42 ) and the first of the conduction bands ( first @xmath39 point above @xmath42 ) .",
    "however , due to the strong interaction with the mn d states , the as p bands ( top of the valence bands in gaas ) are pushed toward higher energies and become half filled .",
    "the mn d bands , which are split into the doubly degenerate @xmath43 band ( @xmath44 ) and the triply degenerate @xmath45 band ( @xmath41 ) are below the fermi energy and entirely occupied .",
    "therefore one can conclude that two important interactions are present : i ) the s - p interaction giving rise to the @xmath46 bond typical of non - magnetic semiconductors and ii ) the p - d interaction responsible for the magnetism , which sets the position and the dispersion of the as p band .",
    "note also that in contrast to the prediction from crystal field theory , the @xmath43 orbitals possess higher energy than the @xmath45 .",
    "this is also due to the strong p - d interaction .",
    "if we now turn our attention to the minority band , we can find most of the features of the majority .",
    "the main difference is the large split between the @xmath45 and the @xmath43 states , which gives rise to a large gap in the band structure .",
    "= 7.7 cm    we observe that the fermi energy cuts through the band center of the high dispersion p band in the majority band , and through the band edge of the almost dispersionless d band in the minority .",
    "this is very important from the point of view of the transport , since very different spin - dependent effective masses are predicted .",
    "when the lattice constant is increased , we expect a general narrowing of all the bands .",
    "this does not affect qualitatively the majority band .",
    "however for some critical lattice spacing the band edge of the @xmath43 band in the minority spin shifts above @xmath42 giving rise to a semiconducting behavior .",
    "this generates the half metallicity .    in summary , if we start from the atomic configuration for mn and as , the mechanism giving rise to the magnetism is the transfer of one electron from the mn d orbitals to the as p shell in order to form the @xmath46 bond .",
    "the remaining 4 electrons in the mn d shell maximize the local magnetic moment of mn due to hund s coupling and the final state turns out to be ferromagnetic due to the strong p - d interaction .",
    "note that these are features of the tetrahedral coordination and are absent in the nias - type structure , where no half metallic state is predicted .",
    "finally we look at the stability of the zincblende structure with respect to the nias - type . the total energy and the saturation magnetization of both the structures as a function of the volume occupied by a mnas pair are presented in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "= 9.7 cm    it is clear that the nias - type has a much lower total energy and also a more compressed lattice .",
    "therefore it is the stable structure at all the thermodynamically accessible pressures .",
    "this is consistent with the very small dilution limit of mn in zincblende gaas and with the fact that the annealing usually induces segregation of mnas nias - type particles within the gaas matrix @xcite .",
    "we also note that for very expanded unit cells the zincblende structure becomes stable with a crossover volume which corresponds to a zincblende lattice constant of 5.8 .",
    "however this large volume increase in the nias - type structure is very unlikely to occur , even if the lattice constants are forced to be large by growing onto substrates with large mismatch . as we noted previously ,",
    "the nias - type structure can easily accommodate large cell distortions ( fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "therefore , at equilibrium it is energetically more favorable for the system to distort the cell , instead of increasing the volume and inducing a nias - type to zincblende transition .",
    "finally we investigate the effect of the anion size on the stability properties of the zincblende structure .",
    "our hope is that for larger ionic radii the nias - type structure should become more rigid and a transition to the zincblende structure at large volume may be induced .",
    "we perform the same calculations described above for mnbi both with nias - type and zincblende structure ( bulk mnbi is a ferromagnetic metal at room temperature with nias - type structure and lattice constants a=4.17 , c=5.764 ) .",
    "we did not find any relevant qualitative difference with respect to the mnas case ( see fig.[fig10 ] ) and this is related to the geometrical argument presented in section iv .",
    "hence we conclude that , for all the mn - pnictides , the nias - type is the more stable crystalline structure and a transition to zincblende structure can be obtained only with highly non - equilibrium methods .",
    "= 7.7 cm = 8.5 cm",
    "finally , to analyze the detailed nature of the mn - as bonding in the zincblende lattice we perform a tight - binding fit to our calculated lda band structure .",
    "we use a fitting algorithm included in the package oxon @xcite which minimizes the following function @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the @xmath49-dimensional vector containing the slater - koster tight - binding parameters @xcite , @xmath50 is the weight assigned to the eigenvalue @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the computed eigenvalue .",
    "we consider first ( mn - as ) and second ( mn - mn and as - as ) nearest neighbor couplings .",
    "this interaction set has been shown to reproduce correctly the valence band and the first of the conduction bands of diamond - like semiconductors @xcite . in the case of mnas",
    "the presence of the mn d band makes the fitting procedure more complicated then in non - magnetic semiconductors .",
    "however we do not need to introduce any _ ad hoc _ excited state ( such as @xmath53 ) to fit the valence band and the first conduction band as is frequently done in the literature @xcite .",
    "the fit has been performed using 350 eigenvalues which correspond to the lowest 10 energies calculated at 35 @xmath10-vectors and the weight is chosen to be 1 for each eigenvalue .",
    "we perform two independent fits for the majority and minority band allowing both the on - site energies and the hopping integrals to be different .    in figures",
    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] we present the best fits for the majority and minority spin band respectively .",
    "we note that the agreement with the _ ab initio _",
    "bands is remarkably good , in particular for the lower lying bands .",
    "the highest bands are not well reproduced ( in particular for the majority spin ) because we did not include higher energy bands in the fit .",
    "the complete parameterization giving rise to the bands in figures [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] is provided in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] .",
    "several important points must be stressed .",
    "first we note that the major difference between the majority and the minority parameters is the value of the mn 3d and as 4p on - site energies .",
    "the on - site energy of the 3d mn orbitals coincides with the position of the @xmath43 states , which by symmetry are weakly coupled to the other bands .",
    "by contrast the @xmath45 states are strongly coupled to the above as p band and this coupling is strongly spin dependent . from table",
    "[ tab2 ] one can see that the dominant hopping integrals are along the mn - as bond and that the parameters are quite similar for the two spin directions .",
    "the only parameters which differ strongly for up and down spin are the sd@xmath54 , pd@xmath54 and pd@xmath55 elements .",
    "these govern the repulsion of the @xmath45 mn d bands and the as p bands and are responsible for the large @xmath43-@xmath45 splitting in the minority band .",
    "= 7.7 cm    = 7.7 cm    finally we check our hypothesis on the formation of a strong @xmath46 bond by comparing the ss , sp and pp hopping integrals for mnas with those of gaas , which have been obtained with the same fitting procedure from our calculated lda band structure .",
    "the gaas parameters are shown in table [ tab3 ] and their magnitude is clearly comparable with the mnas case .",
    "moreover also the second nearest neighbor pp@xmath54 and pp@xmath55 integrals , which are the only second nearest neighbor parameters with appreciable amplitude and the ones that describe most of the dispersion of the as p band along k@xmath56 , are very similar .",
    "this clearly suggests the formation of a strong @xmath46 bond in mnas together with a strong p - d hybridation .",
    "we have investigated theoretically the structural and magnetic properties of the hexagonal nias - type and the zincblende phases of mnas . from the analysis",
    "we conclude that the nias - type structure is more stable at all thermodynamic pressures .",
    "a phase transition to the zincblende structure is predicted for volume stretching , which in principle could be obtained by growing onto a substrate with large lattice mismatch .",
    "however the nias phase can accommodate large lattice distortions which preserve the mn - as nearest neighbor distance and a transition to a zincblende phase looks very unlikely .",
    "we have also investigated the zincblende phase in more detail , since the tetrahedral coordination is crucial for the physics of diluted magnetic semiconductors . by performing both _",
    "ab initio _ calculations and tight - binding fitting we see that two important effects are present : i ) the formation of a stable @xmath46 bond and ii ) a strong p - d hybridation , which splits the mn d bands and gives rise to ferromagnetism . in particular for large lattice spacings the zincblende structure is predicted to be half metallic .",

    "<S> we show that the zincblende structure , although showing half metallic behavior which is very attractive for spintronics , can not be stabilized at equilibrium . we perform a tight - binding analysis of the mn - as bond in the tetrahedral coordination to investigate the nature of the bonding in diluted magnetic semiconductors .    </S>",
