    "this paper is part of an ongoing effort to construct a conformal field theory for every finite index subfactor in such a way that the standard invariant of the subfactor , or at least its quantum double , can be recovered from the cft .",
    "there is no doubt that interesting subfactors arise in cft nor that in some cases the numerical data of the subfactor appears as numerical data in the cft .",
    "but there are supposedly `` exotic '' subfactors for which no cft is known to exist , the first of which was constructed by haagerup in a tour de force in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "but in the last few years ideas of evans and gannon ( see @xcite ) have made it seem plausible that cft s exist for the haagerup and other exotic subfactors constructed in the haagerup line ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this has revived the author s interest in giving a construction of a cft from subfactor data .",
    "the most complete way to do this would be to extract form the subfactor the boltzmann weights of a critical two - dimensional lattice model then construct a quantum field theory from the scaling limit of the @xmath2-point functions .",
    "looking at the monodromy representations of the braid group one would then construct a subfactor as in the very first constructions of @xcite .",
    "this `` royal road '' is paved with many mathematical difficulties and it is probably impossible to complete with current technology except in the very simplest examples .",
    "there are alternatives , however , to using the scaling limit of the @xmath2-point functions .",
    "the algebraic ( haag - kastler @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) approach has been quite successful in understanding some aspects of conformal field theory-@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . after splitting the cft into two chiral halves ,",
    "this approach predicts the existence of `` conformal nets''- von neumann algebras @xmath3 on the hilbert space @xmath4 , associated to closed intervals @xmath5 , and a continuous projective unitary representation @xmath6 , on @xmath4 , satisfying four axioms : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10    here by @xmath11 we mean the subgroup of rotations in diff@xmath12 .",
    "@xmath11 may be supposed to act as an honest representation which can therefore be decomposed into eigenspaces ( fourier modes ) .",
    "the eigenvalues , elements of @xmath13 , are the spectrum @xmath14 of the representation .",
    "there may or may not be a vacuum vector @xmath15 in @xmath4 which would be fixed by the linear fractional transformations in diff@xmath12 , and would be cyclic and separating for all the @xmath16 .    the @xmath16 can be shown to be type iii@xmath17 factors so subfactors appear by axiom ( 2 ) as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the closure of the complement of @xmath20 .",
    "non - trivial examples of such conformal nets were constructed in @xcite,@xcite by the analysis of unitary loop group representations ( @xcite ) .",
    "these examples can be exploited to construct many more .    on an apparently completely different front",
    ", the study of subfactors for their own sake led to the development of `` planar algebras '' which in their strictest form ( @xcite ) are an axiomatization of the standard invariant of a subfactor but by changing the axioms slightly they yield an axiomatization of correspondences ( bimodules ) in the sense of connes ( @xcite ) , and systems of such .",
    "the most significant ingredient of a planar algebra is the existence of a positive definite inner product which is interpreted diagrammatically .",
    "more precisely a planar algebra is a graded vector space @xmath21 of vector spaces where @xmath2 is supposed to count the number of boundary points on a disc into which the elements of @xmath22 can be `` inserted '' . given a planar tangle - a finite collection of discs inside a big ( output ) disc , all discs having boundary points and all boundary points being connected by non - crossing curves called strings , the insertion of elements of @xmath23 into the internal discs produces an output element in @xmath22 , @xmath2 being the number of boundary points on the output disc .    if @xmath24 is one - dimensional the map @xmath25 defines a sesquilinear map to @xmath26 and this is the inner product .",
    "the idea of obtaining a `` continuum limit '' by letting the number of boundary points on the discs fill out the circle has been around for over 20 years but this paper is the first one to take a concrete , though by no means big enough , step in that direction .",
    "planar algebra is an abstraction of the notion of ( planar ) manipulations of the tensor powers of a given finite dimensional hilbert space ( thus in some sense a planar version of @xcite ) , and our constructions below of limit hilbert spaces are really versions , aimed at a scaling rather than a thermodynamic limit , of von neumann s original infinite tensor product-@xcite .",
    "background for this point of view is detailed in @xcite .",
    "given the difficulty of following the royal road using the scaling limit , we are trying to construct the local algebras @xmath16 directly from a planar algebra . a well known idea in physics",
    "is the block spin renormalization procedure ( @xcite ) . here",
    "one groups the spins in a block on one scale and replaces the blocks by spins of the same kind on a coarser scale .",
    "hamiltonians ( interactions ) between the spins and blocks of spins are chosen so that the physics on the block spin scale resembles the physics on the original scale .",
    "this procedure is tricky to implement but we shall use the idea . for , however one plays it , in constructing a continuum limit one must relate the hilbert space on one scale to the hilbert space on a finer scale .",
    "it is this relation that we are trying to produce using structures suggested by planar algebra .",
    "more precisely , given a planar algebra @xmath23 , for a choice of @xmath2 points on @xmath27 , called @xmath28 , we will associate the hilbert space @xmath29 , and for an inclusion @xmath30 we will use planar algebra data to group boundary points into blocks and construct a projection from @xmath31 onto @xmath32 . alternatively we are defining isometries of @xmath33 into @xmath34 and the hilbert space @xmath4 of the theory will then be the direct limit of the @xmath32 .",
    "the first embeddings of @xmath33 into @xmath34 will work for _ any _ finite subsets of @xmath27 by simply adding points using an essentially trivial element of the planar algebra .",
    "we will briefly describe these embeddings as they are a simplified template for what follows .",
    "in particular one obtains projective unitary representations of diff@xmath12(and coherent local algebras if desired ) .",
    "but this construction fails to be of any interest for two essential reasons .",
    "the first is that the unitary representations are independent of the planar algebra data used .",
    "the second is more serious- the action of diff@xmath12is hopelessly discontinuous .",
    "we have no answer to the discontinuity problem . in a sense",
    "it would be surprising if we did since our input is entirely kinematic .",
    "we have not constructed any hamiltonian , local or otherwise , and we have done nothing to cause positivity of the energy .",
    "we hope to construct dynamics in a forthcoming paper .    on the other hand we have managed to take into account more of the planar algebra structure and with it we have been led to unitary ( projective ) representations of thompson s groups of @xmath35 homeomorphisms of @xmath27 and @xmath36 $ ] which play the role of diff@xmath12 in our not yet continuum limit",
    "the idea is to use an element of @xmath37 for @xmath38 to embed hilbert spaces associated with finitely many points into each other by grouping together @xmath39 `` spins '' on one scale into a single spin on a more coarse scale .",
    "this is just what is done in block spin renormalisation .",
    "although this block spin idea does not introduce dynamics , we will see that it does produce interesting unitary representations of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in particular these representations do depend on the planar algebra data used to construct them .",
    "a perhaps surprising byproduct arises if one uses `` crossings '' from the conway knot - theoretic skein theory and knot polynomial theory . for then the coefficient of the `` vacuum vector '' in the representation",
    "is an unoriented link .",
    "one of our main results is that all unoriented links arise in this way .",
    "thompson group elements are often defined by pairs of bifurcating rooted planar trees with the same number of leaves .",
    "there is a simple construction of the link from the pair of trees .",
    "the stabilization move ( canceling carets- see @xcite ) corresponds to adding a distant unknot to the link . but",
    "a pair of trees with no canceling carets is in fact a well defined description of a thompson group element and the algorithm we give , which produces a thompson group element from a link , will not introduce any spurious unknots .",
    "_ so , at least for unoriented links , the thompson group @xmath41 is just as effective at producing links as the braid groups . _",
    "but one may use simpler planar algebras , the simplest possible being that of an index 2 subfactor .",
    "a natural choice of @xmath42 then gives representations that are in fact linearized permutation representations ( quasi - regular representations ) .",
    "the stabilizers of the vacuum in this representation are subgroups @xmath0 and @xmath1 which we call the oriented thompson groups since a certain surface constructed from them is always orientable .",
    "sapir has shown the delightful result that @xmath43 is in fact a copy of thompson s group @xmath44 inside @xmath45 !",
    "another motivation for this work was to try to exploit the list of subfactors of small index @xcite .",
    "typically these factors are quite `` supertransitive '' , i.e. the new information they contain does not appear in @xmath22 until @xmath2 is @xmath46 .",
    "we would like in future work to extend our theory to use elements of these higher @xmath22 s to block spins together .",
    "a planar algebra @xmath23 is a vector space @xmath22 , graded first and foremost by @xmath47 and admitting multilinear operations indexed by _ planar tangles _ @xmath40 which are subsets of the plane consisting of a large ( output ) circle containing smaller ( input circles ) .",
    "there are also non - intersecting smooth curves called strings whose end points , if they have any , lie on the circles where they are called marked points .",
    "elements of @xmath23 are `` inserted '' into the input circles with an element of @xmath22 going into a disc with @xmath2 marked points , and the result of the operation specified by the tangle is in @xmath48 where there are @xmath49 marked points on the output circle . in order to resolve cyclic ambiguities ,",
    "each of the circles of @xmath40 comes with a privileged interval between marked points which we will denote in pictures by putting a @xmath50 sign near that interval .",
    "here is an example of a planar tangle : +    the result of the operation indexed by @xmath40 on elements of @xmath23 is denoted @xmath51 where there are @xmath2 input discs .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the operation @xmath52 depends only on @xmath40 up to smooth planar isotopy so one has a lot of freedom drawing the tangles , in particular the circles may be replaced by rectangles when it is convenient .",
    "tangles may also be `` labelled '' by actually writing appropriately graded elements of @xmath23 inside some of the internal circles .",
    "[ partition function]given a planar tangle @xmath40 all of whose internal circles are labelled by @xmath53 we call @xmath51 the element of @xmath48 which it defines . if @xmath54 and the dimension of @xmath55 is one , this may be identified with a scalar using the rule that @xmath56 .",
    "planar tangles can be glued in an obvious way along input circles and the operations @xmath52 are by definition compatible with the gluing .",
    "planar algebras come in many varieties according to further decorations of the planar tangles such as oriented strings , labelled strings , coloured regions .",
    "these decorations are incorporated by further grading of the vector spaces @xmath22 .",
    "perhaps the easiest such decoration is a shading , where the regions of the tangle are shaded or unshaded in such a way that adjacent regions have opposite shadings .",
    "this forces the number of boundary points of each circle to be even so for historical reasons the grading then becomes half the number of marked points .",
    "this can cause confusion .",
    "when @xmath40 is shaded , the @xmath50 signs may be in shaded or unshaded even in the shaded case it can be cumbersome to drag along all the shadings and @xmath57 signs .",
    "so when it suits us we will ignore them and trust that the reader can fill in the details by copying the instances where we do , out of necessity , consider the shadings carefully .    for connections with physics and von neumann algebras",
    ", planar algebras will have more structure , namely an antilinear involution @xmath58 on each @xmath22 compatible with orientation reversing diffeomorphisms acting on tangles . if @xmath59 we get a sesquilinear inner product @xmath60 on each @xmath22 given in the introduction .",
    "a planar algebra will be called _ positive definite _ if this inner product is .    in order to accommodate knot - theoretic applications we will not in general restrict to",
    "the situation where the @xmath22 are finite dimensional and @xmath61 is positive definite .",
    "our planar algebras will all have a parameter @xmath62 which is the value of a homologically trivial closed string which may be removed from any tangle with multiplication by the scalar @xmath62 .",
    "two examples of planar algebras should be mentioned .",
    "the first is the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath63 ( which has its origins in @xcite though its appearance here should properly be attributed to @xcite , via @xcite - see also @xcite ) which may be shaded or unshaded .",
    "a basis of @xmath64 consists of all isotopy classes of systems of non - crossing strings joining @xmath65 points inside the disc .",
    "the planar algebra operations are the obvious gluing ones with the rule that any closed strings that may be formed in the gluing process are discarded but each one counts for a multiplicative factor of @xmath62 .",
    "this planar algebra is positive definite iff @xmath66 .",
    "the second examples of planar algebras which we will use are the spin planar algebras . for fixed integer @xmath67",
    "one considers @xmath68 as a set of `` spins '' .",
    "the shaded planar algebra @xmath69 is then defined by @xmath70 , @xmath71 and for @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( using half the number of marked boundary points ) .",
    "shaded tangles then give contraction systems for spin configurations as explained in @xcite .",
    "this kind of planar algebra is what is used in several 2 dimensional statistical mechanical models such as the ising , potts and fateev - zamolodchikov models .",
    "it is important to note that closed strings have parameter either one or @xmath74 depending on whether they enclose an unshaded or shaded region respectively .",
    "the various tangles may be used to endow a planar algebra with a large number of algebraic structures such as filtered algebras , graded algebras and tensor categories .",
    "we will be interested only in two such structures and their representations , the rectangular and affine categories .",
    "the _ rectangular category _",
    "@xmath75 of a planar algebra will be the ( linear ) category whose objects are @xmath47 ( along with other decorations according to shading etc ) and whose set of morphisms from @xmath2 to @xmath76 is the vector space @xmath77 , with composition according to the following concatenation tangle read from top to bottom ( which makes each @xmath22 into an algebra ) : + composition of @xmath78 with @xmath79 :    a representation of @xmath75 will be called a rectangular representation .    a planar algebra always admits a privileged rectangular representation :    [ regular ] the _ regular representation _ of the planar algebra @xmath23 is the one with @xmath80 for all @xmath2 ( with @xmath57 in the shaded case ) and the action being just concatenation of rectangular tangles .",
    "the regular representation has a @xmath24-valued invariant inner product given by @xmath60 as below .    where we have been careful to close the tangle with strings to the left as we will be dealing with a non spherically invariant planar algebra below .    in the subfactor case",
    "any irreducible rectangular representation is a subrepresentation of the regular representation but in general we may define rectangular representations by minimal projections @xmath81 in the algebras @xmath48 , the vector space @xmath82 of the representation being equal to @xmath83 with @xmath81 considered as the element @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 , with action of morphisms by concatenation .",
    "for example : + action of @xmath88 on @xmath89 :    the _ affine _ category @xmath90 is the ( linear ) category whose objects are sets @xmath91 of @xmath76 points on the unit circle in @xmath26 ( along with other decorations according to shading etc ) and whose vector space of morphisms from @xmath91 to @xmath92 is the set of linear combinations of labelled tangles ( with marked boundary points @xmath93 ) between the unit circle and a circle of larger radius modulo any relations in @xmath23 which occur within contractible discs between the unit circle and the larger circle .",
    "composition of morphisms comes from rescaling and gluing the larger circle of the first morphism to the smaller circle of the second .",
    "use of @xmath91 adds to clutter so we will abuse notation by using just @xmath76 for an object of @xmath90 with @xmath76 points , though when we need it later on we will be quite careful to specify what sets of @xmath27 we are talking about .",
    "one needs to be careful with this definition ( see @xcite,@xcite ) . in a representation of @xmath90 , morphisms may be changed by planar isotopies without affecting the action , but the isotopies are required to be the identity on the inner and outer circles",
    ". thus the tangle of rotation by 360 degrees does not necessarily act by the identity in a representation of @xmath94 .",
    "the representations we will consider of @xmath94 are called lowest weight modules and may be defined as in @xcite by taking a representation @xmath95 of the algebra @xmath96 for some @xmath2 ( the `` lowest weight '' ) and inducing it in the obvious way .",
    "this may cause problems with positive definiteness but it is known that subfactor planar algebras possess a host of such representations .",
    "the vector spaces @xmath97 of such a lowest weight representation are zero if @xmath98 and spanned by diagrams consisting of a vector @xmath99 inside a disc with @xmath2 marked points , surrounded by a labelled planar tangle of @xmath23 with @xmath49 marked points on the output circle .",

    ", irreducible lowest weight representations are parametrized by their lowest weight ( the smallest @xmath2 for which @xmath82 is non - zero ) , and a complex number of absolute value one which is the eigenvalue for the rotation tangle .",

    "suppose we are also given an affine representation @xmath113of @xmath114 with lowest weight space @xmath97 .    with no more data than this",
    "we can make a naive construction of a hilbert space `` continuum '' limit .    .",
    "if @xmath115 is the directed set of finite subsets of @xmath27 , directed by inclusion , define the directed system of hilbert spaces @xmath116 for @xmath117 , with inclusion maps @xmath118 ( for @xmath119 ) defined by the following affine tangles :    in this example there are 3 points in @xmath120 and 6 in @xmath121 .",
    "the points in @xmath120 are to be joined to themselves on the outside boundary by radial straight lines , and the points in @xmath122 are attached to an instance of @xmath42 . since @xmath112 these @xmath123 s define isometric embeddings of @xmath124 into @xmath125 which are obviously compatible with inclusions .",

    "the hilbert space is not separable and the action of the diffeomorphism group is hopelessly discontinuous .    one may remedy the lack of separability by restricting consideration to the net of finite subsets of a countable set like the rationals but this does not make things any more continuous . if we restrict to the dyadic rationals we obtain unitary representations of thompson s group @xmath40 and by restriction to thompson s group @xmath41 .",
