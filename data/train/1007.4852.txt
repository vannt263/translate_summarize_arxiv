    "cold atoms and molecules have proven to be a useful platform for a variety of precision measurement and quantum information experiments .",
    "optical lattices provide a method of trapping cold atoms and molecules that minimizes doppler shifts and allows long measurement times",
    ". however , the trapping field causes shifts in the internal energy levels via the ac stark effect , and these shifts depend on the intensity of the trapping lasers .",
    "this problem has been considered in detail in the context of optical lattice clocks ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the solution employed in these works is to use an optical lattice operating at  magic \" trapping conditions ( e.g. , magic wavelength ) for which the energy levels of interest experience the same shift , even as the atom or molecule moves within the lattice . this leaves the transition frequency of interest unchanged , as long as higher - order effects are negligible .",
    "in another recent work , the problem of removing stark and zeeman shifts simultaneously was considered for alkali - metals  @xcite . in each of these works ,",
    "cancellation of the stark shift was achieved for a specific clock or qubit transition in a single atomic species .",
    "in other experiments , simultaneous trapping of two atomic species has been achieved using double magneto - optical traps ( mots )  @xcite , combined with an optical dipole trap in  @xcite , with the primary goal of sympathetically cooling atomic species that are difficult to cool directly . however , in these experiments the internal states of the atoms are heavily perturbed by the mot , which is disadvantageous for precision measurements .",
    "comagnetometry experiments also utilize two atomic species sharing the same volume .",
    "one such apparatus was used to create a highly accurate nuclear spin gyroscope  @xcite , while other groups have used comagnetometers in searches for physics beyond the standard model , such as setting upper bounds on p , t - violating permanent electric dipole moment  @xcite as well as bounds on lorentz and _ cpt _ violation  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we aim to merge these ideas by considering two atomic species trapped in the same  magic \" optical lattice .",
    "our goal is to achieve stark - shift cancellation simultaneously in both atomic species , for a single two - level transition in each .",
    "we first introduce the equations underlying the ac stark effect .",
    "these equations guide our selection of favorable atom pairs to analyze in detail . finally , we present results of numerical calculations on @xmath1al paired with sr , yb , and other divalent atoms .",
    "the derivation of the stark shift follows closely the treatment in  @xcite and  @xcite , so only a summary of the results will be given here .",
    "the ac stark shift of an atomic state @xmath3 with total angular momentum @xmath4 and projection @xmath5 can be written as   @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the amplitude and frequency of the lattice light field .",
    "the frequency - dependent atomic - structure pre - factor @xmath9 is the total ac polarizability of the state ; it may be decomposed in terms of irreducible tensor operators as    @xmath10    here @xmath11 is the degree of circular polarization , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the scalar , vector , and tensor polarizabilities , respectively , and the unit vectors are the lattice laser wavevector ( @xmath15 ) , polarization ( @xmath16 ) , and quantization axis ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "[ fig : geom ] depicts the geometry .    , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the lattice wavevector , lattice polarization , and quantization axis , respectively . for circular polarization , we take @xmath16 to be complex , following the jones calculus conventions . in this case",
    "@xmath18 is unchanged , while @xmath19 is no longer well - defined .",
    "[ fig : geom ] ]    the quantization axis is defined by an applied static magnetic field , whose orientation relative to the optical lattice may be arbitrary . this ",
    "quantizing magnetic field \" ensures that @xmath5 remains a  good \" quantum number for the ac stark - effect perturbation formalism , from which eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphatot ] ) is derived ; the energy shifts due to the stark effect must be small compared with the zeeman splitting of the magnetic sublevels . it is important to note that the total polarizability depends not only on the spatial orientation of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , but also on the lattice frequency @xmath8 as well . also useful",
    "is the total differential polarizability @xmath20 between two states @xmath21 and @xmath22 , given simply by @xmath23 analogously , we will use the scalar differential polarizability , defined as @xmath24 and also the vector and tensor differential polarizabilities , defined similarly .    for linearly polarized light",
    ", the vector contribution vanishes ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 , where @xmath19 is the angle between the polarization and quantization unit vectors .",
    "then the total polarizability becomes    @xmath27    in the case of circularly polarized light , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath18 is the angle between the wavevector and quantization unit vectors .",
    "@xmath16 is taken to be complex and constant in time , rather than real and time varying .",
    "this means that , although counterintuitive , @xmath30 is time - independent even for circular polarization .",
    "the total polarizability is then    @xmath31    it should be noted that in both cases , the stark shift depends on only one angle ( either @xmath19 or @xmath18 , but not both ) .",
    "this means that for purely circularly or linearly polarized light , we have only two  handles , \" not three , with which to achieve  magic \" conditions : a single angle and the lattice frequency @xmath8 .",
    "it should be noted that the tabulated formulae are valid only for a sufficiently weak magnetic field . for finite b fields",
    ", the stark shift acquires an additional cross - term formed as a product of the zeeman and vector light shifts ; this provides an additional knob for tuning magic conditions ( see  @xcite ) ; we will comment on this in section  [ sec : rbcs ] .",
    "guided by the above equations , we state some general guidelines in selecting two atomic species to trap .",
    "consider first the vector and tensor polarizabilities .",
    "these are rank 1 and rank 2 irreducible tensor operators , respectively .",
    "triangular selection rules dictate that @xmath14 must vanish for @xmath32 states , and that both @xmath14 and @xmath13 must vanish for @xmath33 states . alternately , the polarizabilities of @xmath33 states have no dependence on the angles @xmath19 or @xmath18 .",
    "this leads us to consider divalent atoms , such as sr or yb , which have @xmath34 ground states .",
    "the bosonic isotopes have nuclear spin @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 : due to the angular selection rules @xmath14 and @xmath13 must vanish .",
    "the fermionic isotopes have @xmath37 , and so ( for @xmath38 ) , @xmath14 and @xmath13 do not vanish identically .",
    "however , @xmath14 and @xmath13 are nonzero only due to a highly suppressed contribution from the hyperfine interaction ( hfi ) , and so @xmath12 dominates . for optical transitions between @xmath0 electronic states ,",
    "the differential polarizability is almost entirely due to the scalar polarizability .",
    "therefore the light shift , being of scalar nature , does not depend on atomic spatial orientation .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath39 clock transitions in divalent atoms , the dependence on geometry is negligible and  magic \" conditions are set entirely by the lattice frequency .",
    "if one of our two trapped atomic species is a scalar atom , we must use a  magic \" lattice frequency for that atom .",
    "since the frequency becomes fixed , we have to achieve magic conditions for the second species solely by manipulating one angle , @xmath19 or @xmath18 ( for fixed circular or linear polarization ) .",
    "while the discussion so far has been of a general nature , for illustration let us consider microwave hyperfine transitions attached to a @xmath40 electronic state in our second atomic species .",
    "the relevant atoms may include the ground state alkali - metal atoms ( @xmath41 ground states ) or group iii atoms ( @xmath42 ground states ) . to minimize zeeman shifts",
    ", we will work with @xmath43 states exclusively , which also eliminates the vector term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphacirc ] ) .",
    "there are some technical but important peculiarities associated with computing stark shifts between levels of the same hyperfine manifold : we are considering the stark shift of hyperfine levels attached to the same electronic state . to the leading order",
    ", the shift is determined by the properties of the underlying electronic state . however , because the electronic state for both hyperfine levels is the same , the scalar stark shift of both levels is the same .",
    "an apparent difference between the two clock levels is caused by the hyperfine interaction ( hfi ) , and the rigorous analysis involves so - called hfi - mediated polarizabilities  @xcite .",
    "similarly , when neglecting the hfi , the _ tensor _ shift for the @xmath40 state vanishes due to the angular selection rules ; we are also led to a necessity to treat the tensor shift using the hfi - mediated polarizabilities .    as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath43 clock or qubit states and fixed @xmath44 or @xmath45 geometry neither rb nor cs can be magically trapped .",
    "however , the magic trapping can be achieved for al and ga .",
    "our consideration here is more general , as we also consider varying rotation angles . still even in our more general setup",
    "we do not find magic angles for the @xmath43 clock or qubit states in cs and rb ( again this statement is limited only to the weak b field regime ) .",
    "we focus below on al , where the required magic angles can be found . to summarize , we choose a scalar divalent atom and a non - scalar valence state atom to trap simultaneously .",
    "we choose for our optical lattice a  magic \" frequency for the divalent atom , so the differential polarizability for its optical transition of interest is zero . at this lattice frequency ,",
    "the differential polarizability for the microwave transition in the non - scalar atom is non - vanishing , in general .",
    "but by tuning @xmath19 or @xmath18 ( depending on lattice polarization ) , we aim to create  magic \" conditions in the non - scalar atom as well .",
    "we perform numerical calculations to find  magic \" conditions for particular pairs of atoms . utilizing a variety of relativistic many - body techniques , as described in  @xcite",
    ", we calculate the atomic polarizabilities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphalin ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphacirc ] ) .",
    "we then numerically search for values of @xmath46 or @xmath47 that will make @xmath20 vanish in the non - scalar atom .",
    "we focus our attention on @xmath2sr paired with @xmath1al , although we also present results for @xmath1al paired with other divalent atoms . in @xmath2sr , the transition of interest is between the @xmath48  @xmath49 ground state and the @xmath50  @xmath51 metastable state  @xcite . in @xmath1al ,",
    "the transition of interest is between the @xmath52 and @xmath53 hyperfine states , both in the @xmath54 electronic ground state .",
    "we work with @xmath55 states exclusively in al so that ( to first order ) zeeman shifts vanish .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : al_813 ] we plot results representative of our numerical calculations .",
    "we graph the differential polarizability between the two hyperfine states in @xmath1al as a function of angle , for linear and circular lattice polarizations .    while section  [ chooseatoms ] suggests that stark - shift cancellation may be possible for @xmath1al at arbitrary lattice frequencies , it is not obvious if  magic \" angles for @xmath1al actually exist at the  magic \" wavelengths for the divalent atoms of interest . considering eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphalin ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphacirc ] ) , we note that the prefactor on the tensor term varies from approximately @xmath56 to @xmath57 for linear polarization and from @xmath58 to @xmath57 for circular polarization .",
