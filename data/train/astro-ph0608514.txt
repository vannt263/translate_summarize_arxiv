    "the detection of high energy neutrinos is considered one of the most promising means to investigate non - thermal processes in the universe .",
    "a first generation of small scale detectors has been realized ( nt-200 @xcite in the baikal lake and amanda @xcite at the south pole ) , demonstrating the possibility to use the erenkov technique to track high energy neutrinos . besides , these experiments have set limits on neutrino fluxes .",
    "other small scale detectors are at different stage of realization ( antares @xcite and nestor @xcite ) .",
    "actual expectations on neutrino fluxes , mainly based on the measured cosmic ray fluxes and the estimated fluxes for several high energy sources from theoretical models @xcite , require detectors of km@xmath0 scale .",
    "following the success of amanda , the largest operating detector , the realization of the icecube km@xmath0 detector @xcite has started at the south pole . on the other hand , many issues , as the full sky coverage ,",

    "the nemo collaboration @xcite is performing r&d towards the design and construction of the mediterranean km@xmath0 neutrino detector .",
    "the activity was mainly focused on the search and characterization of an optimal site for the detector installation and on the development of a feasibility study for the detector .",
    "a deep sea site with optimal features in terms of depth and water optical properties has been identified at a depth of 3500 m about 80 km off - shore capo passero and a long term monitoring of the site has been carried out @xcite .",
    "the feasibility study of the km@xmath0 detector includes the analysis of all the construction and installation issues and the optimization of the detector geometry by means of numerical simulations .",
    "the validation of the proposed technologies via an advanced r&d activity , the prototyping of the proposed technical solutions and their relative validation in deep sea environment will be carried out with the two pilot projects nemo phase-1 and phase-2 @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the nemo - km@xmath0 telescope simulated in this work is a square array of @xmath1 towers equipped with 5832 optical modules ( 10 `` diameter pmts ) @xcite .",
    "the towers , moored on the seabed at 3500 m depth , have an instrumented height of 680 m , with a storey - storey distance of 40 m , and are spaced of 140 m. the detector response is simulated using the codes developed by the antares collaboration @xcite . in the simulation codes , the light absorption length , measured in the site of capo passero ( @xmath2 m at 440 nm @xcite ) , is taken into account .",
    "once the sample of pmt hits is generated , spurious pmt hits , due to the underwater optical noise ( @xmath3k decay ) , are introduced , with a rate of 30 khz for 10 '' pmts , corresponding to the average value measured in capo passero site .",
    "the simulated detector lay - out reaches an effective area of 1 km@xmath4 at a muon energy of about 10 tev and an angular resolution of a few tenths of degrees at the same energy as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : aeff ] .",
    "the detector angular resolution is one of the most important parameters in the identification of point - like sources . therefore , an experimental determination is required . a possible method , already adopted in cosmic ray detectors , consists in the observation of the so called _ moon shadow _ @xcite .",
    "since the moon absorbs cosmic rays , we expect a lack of atmospheric muons from the direction of the moon disk .",
    "the detection of the muon deficit provides a measurement of the detector angular resolution .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the nemo telescope could be able to detect the _ moon shadow _ and that about 100 days are needed to observe a @xmath5 effect . assuming a detector point spread function with a gaussian shape , the same simulations yields a detector angular resolution @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : moon_plot ] ) . besides detecting its position in the sky allows us to determine the absolute orientation of the detector @xcite .",

    "when the event weight is calculated , the neutrino absorption in the earth , as a function of neutrino energy and direction , is taken into account @xcite .",
