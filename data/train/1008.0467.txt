    "although the proton is the simplest system in which the three colors of qcd neutralize into a colorless bound state , we still do not know how to describe the proton in terms of its fundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom from basic principles .",
    "the structure of the proton is rather complicated due to the nonperturbative and relativistic nature of the quark and gluon in the protons .",
    "the complication also comes from the presence of sea quarks in the proton .",
    "the sea flavor symmetry naively assumed in the gottfried sum rule  @xcite , which is a symmetry between the light flavor @xmath3 and @xmath4 sea quarks inside the proton , was disproved by experiments of both deep inelastic scattering and drell - yan processes @xcite .",
    "many theoretical attempts have been made to describe the origin of the nucleon sea and its antiquark asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the primary mechanism to generate the sea is gluon splitting into @xmath5 and @xmath6 pairs .",
    "field and feynman @xcite suggested that the extra valence @xmath3 quark in the proton could lead to a suppression of @xmath7 relative to @xmath8 via pauli blocking .",
    "but a subsequent calculation @xcite found that the effects of pauli blocking are very small , and this result has been confirmed by another calculation@xcite .",
    "thus , it is believed that there must be a nonperturbative origin .",
    "for example , the meson - cloud inside the nucleon can account for such asymmetry  @xcite and chiral quark models  @xcite .",
    "also the large-@xmath9 approach  @xcite can explain the flavor asymmetry of the antiquark distribution .    another attempt to understand",
    "the sea flavor asymmetry of the proton is from a pure statistical consideration in a kinetic equilibrium model  @xcite or `` statistical balance model '' as called in previous papers .",
    "the idea is rather simple and perspicuous : while the sea quark - antiquark @xmath10 and @xmath11 pairs can be produced by gluon splitting with equal probabilities , the time - reversal invariant processes of the annihilation of the antiquarks with their quark partners into gluons are not flavor symmetric due to the net excess of @xmath3 quarks over @xmath4 quarks . as a consequence , the @xmath12 quarks have a larger probability to annihilate with the @xmath3 quarks than that of the @xmath13 quarks , and this brings an excess of @xmath13 over @xmath12 inside the proton . taking the proton as an ensemble of a complete set of quark - gluon fock states , and assuming the probability of ` arriving in ' one state from others equals to the probability of ` leaving ' it , one can obtain the probabilities of finding every fock state ( state density ) in the proton .",
    "thus one can calculate the quark and gluon content of the nucleon from a pure statistical consideration .",
    "it is interesting that the model gives a sea flavor @xmath12 and @xmath13 asymmetry as @xmath14 \\sim 0.132 $ ] , which agrees with the experimental data    the following diagram can describe the ` state shifting ' between states .        assuming kinetic equilibrium , we have these kinetic equilibrium equations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is @xmath17 state density",
    ", @xmath18 is the non - normalized state - shift probability(nssp ) of @xmath19,@xmath20 is the total state number .",
    "also there is the normalization condition @xmath21 if we know @xmath18 , we can derive state densities @xmath16 s by solving a system of @xmath20 linear algebraic equations when @xmath20 is a finite number .",
    "if @xmath20 is infinite , we can get @xmath16 by asymptotic approach in some case if @xmath16 converges as @xmath22 .",
    "actually , if we change @xmath18 to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a arbitrary constant , the result would be the same .",
    "it means we only need the ratios of nssps @xmath18 s .",
    "if only considering the particle numbers of quark , anti - quark and gluon , the proton state can be described as an ensemble of fock states @xmath25 because the u - quark number @xmath26,and @xmath27 , all fock state can be denoted with just three numbers as @xmath28 .    in order to derive the state density @xmath29 we should know the probability of states shifting .",
    "we introduce the rate @xmath30 as a quark splitting ability factor , there are @xmath31 quarks(including antiquarks ) in the initial state , so the nssp of @xmath32 is @xmath33 we also introduce the splitting rate @xmath34 and @xmath35 , so the nssp of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is @xmath38 and the nssp of @xmath32 is @xmath39    now , we consider the time - reversal process and assume those fusion rates @xmath40 for time - reversal invariance .    hence , the nssp of @xmath41 is @xmath42 the nssp of @xmath43 is @xmath44 the nssp of @xmath45 is @xmath46 we can see that the probability of @xmath10 annihilation is larger than @xmath11 annihilation in all of the proton states because of valence quark asymmetry .",
    "this is the origin of the sea quark flavor asymmetry .",
    "it is assumed that all the splitting and fusion rates are the same in the previous papers  @xcite .",
    "if we get all the non - normalized state - shift probabilities @xmath18 , the state densities can be derived out if the particle numbers @xmath47 are finite .",
    "we set an artificial limit @xmath48 and solve the finite linear equations .",
    "the numeric state densities are then derived .",
    "the sea quark flavor asymmetry can be written as : @xmath49=\\sum_{\\bar{u},\\bar{d},g}(n_{\\bar{d}}-n_{\\bar{u}})\\rho_{|n_{\\bar{u}},n_{\\bar{d}},n_{g}>}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sea quark flavor asymmetry converges to 0.133 when @xmath50 increases .",
    "the result is consistent with experiment data  @xcite .",
    "some subsequent works  @xcite followed the kinetic equilibrium principle to study the spin of nucleons and the parton distributions in the proton and pion , and obtained quite good results agreeing with the corresponding experimental values .",
    "however , in the previous works , we assumed that all the splitting rates are the same as @xmath51 and did not estimate the `` error bound '' caused by the assumption .",
    "as we can imagine , if the splitting - rates vary in different orders of magnitude , the convergence of flavor asymmetry will be bad .",
    "it is necessary to solve large @xmath50 linear equations .",
    "so we need a convenient numerical method to explore the effects of different splitting - rates and to study more complex hadronic states .",
    "monte carlo simulation also can give the numeric state densities instead of solving algebraic equations even when the number of states is infinite . here , we want to explain some details about the monte carlo evolution on kinetic equilibrium and prove the equivalence between monte carlo evolution approach and solving algebraic equations .",
    "let us start with an arbitrary initial state @xmath17 , and then let it make a possible shifting during each unit step .",
    "the probability of the state @xmath17 shifting to @xmath52 is @xmath23 . here",
    ", @xmath24 is an arbitrary large constant we introduced to ensure that the total shifting probability for each prior state is less than @xmath53 .",
    "it is required that @xmath54 for all prior states @xmath17 , so the probability of staying in the prior state @xmath17 is @xmath55 the state evolves step - by - step as random walk , and we record the number of iteration steps as @xmath56 while the state @xmath17 is emerging . and after a large number of iteration steps @xmath57 , the normalized @xmath17 emerging probability is @xmath58 . for each step while the state is @xmath17 , the next step has the probability @xmath23 to be @xmath52 .",
    "so there are the times @xmath59 of state shifting @xmath60 .",
    "of course , other states also can shift to @xmath52 , meanwhile @xmath52 has chance to stay at @xmath52 .",
    "that means the number of those steps @xmath52 emerging should be @xmath61 the equation can be reduced to @xmath62 the equation is independent of the constant @xmath24 .",
    "the value of @xmath24 only determines the number of iteration steps needed to arrive at the equilibrium state after starting from an arbitrary initial state . we can find the above equation is just the kinetic equilibrium equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , if we consider that the normalized @xmath17 emerging probability @xmath58 is equivalent to the state density as @xmath63    and we also have the sum condition @xmath64 which is equal to the normalization condition eq([eq2 ] ) .",
    "hence , we proved the equivalence of the monte carlo simulation approach and solving algebraic equations .",
    "the monte carlo simulation approach provides a powerful method for solving kinetic equilibrium ensemble problems .",
    "this method is error - controllable and very useful especially on complex multistate systems , such as the applications to other hadrons in the following sections .",
    "we gain the same value of the sea quark flavor asymmetry @xmath65 in the proton as expected . here",
    ", the error bar @xmath66 is the standard deviation of results with different random number series , and the deviation will decrease when computing time increases .",
    "the fusion rate should be the same as the splitting rates for a time - reversal process .",
    "in other words , the evolution in the proton should be time - reversal invariant .",
    "but there is no principle requires that the quark and gluon splitting evolution abilities of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are equal .",
    "therefore we should introduce three splitting - rates @xmath69,@xmath34 and @xmath35 to represent the quark and gluon splitting evolution abilities which are determined by the dynamics of quarks and gluons .",
    "each rate enhances the corresponding splitting or fusion evolution probability . in previous works",
    ", we assumed that all the splitting - rates are the same to be @xmath70 and did not estimate the `` error band '' caused by the assumption . in the present work",
    ", we introduced a numerical monte carlo approach .",
    "this new method is easy to apply to complex systems , and it is easy to put the variable splitting rates in evolutions and calculate the deviation caused by them .    in the above section , we can see that the state densities or results are independent of the constant @xmath24 . the numerical value of @xmath71 , for example , is input as @xmath72 .",
    "therefore the result does not depend on the absolute value of @xmath71 .",
    "it means that the sea quark asymmetry does not depend on the absolute values of those splitting rates .",
    "only two ratios between three splitting rates will affect the state densities and the value of sea quark flavor asymmetry .",
    "so , we can fix the rate @xmath73 , and vary the other two ratios @xmath74 and @xmath75 as two parameters in the model .",

    "the previous result @xmath65 is reproduced when @xmath112 .    from table",
    "[ table1 ] , we can see that the asymmetry value @xmath14 $ ] is not sensitive to the model parameter @xmath74 , it is almost fixed when @xmath74 varies in a very large range over five order of magnitudes .",
    "we also can find that the values of asymmetry are always larger than @xmath113 whatever the splitting rates vary in an arbitrary large range .",
    "it reflects the principle of statistics contributes the dominant part of sea quark flavor asymmetry .",
    "the asymmetry only has a variation @xmath114=(0.12 - 0.16)$ ] which is within @xmath115 when @xmath116 varies in the range @xmath117 , and still a small variation @xmath118=(0.12 - 0.18)$ ] even when @xmath119 varies in a larger magnitude range @xmath120 .",
    "so the effect brought from details of the dynamics is small and within the bound of the experiments uncertainty .    by",
    "now , we do not consider the probability of @xmath121 splitting and @xmath122 recombination yet , because the probability is suppressed by coupling constant and `` three - body '' splitting kinematics .",
    "@xmath121 can be regarded as two successive @xmath123 , and its effect is same as the effect of increasing @xmath35 , as we can see from table [ table3 ] .",
    "however , the rate of three - body splitting @xmath124 must be much smaller than two - body splitting @xmath125 or @xmath126 , because the three - body phase space in perturbative qcd is suppressed by a factor of 2 - 3 order of magnitudes comparing with the two - body splitting . though the parton splitting in hadrons is a strong - coupling non - perturbative process",
    ", we believe that we still can safely assume @xmath127 which only causes a very small enhancement as shown in table [ table3 ] .",
    "the effect of the splitting @xmath124 is thus negligible .",

    "this parameter is qcd relevant and it is the only input from dynamics .",
    "if the parameter could be fixed by analysis of qcd , the deviation on sea quark asymmetry caused by the details of dynamics can be determined and the sea quark flavor asymmetry in proton is predictable .",
    "these two splitting vertices are qcd vertices and have the same coupling constant .",
    "the splitting kinematics of @xmath138 and @xmath139 are also similar .",
    "so , the splitting rates of @xmath138 and @xmath140 should be in the same order of magnitude .",
    "the assumption can be supported by the integrations of altarelli - parisi(a - p ) splitting functions . though these equations are valid in the perturbative region and the parton splitting in hadrons is a nonperturbative process",
    ", the ratio of the total splitting rates is still inspirational .",
    "the ratio parameter @xmath75 can be heuristically `` derived '' from altarelli - parisi splitting functions@xcite .",

    "so the splitting - rates directly to be : @xmath145    the rates @xmath146 and @xmath147 are logarithmic divergent when the integration limit @xmath148 , but fortunately the ratio between the two rates is not divergent , and thus we have the model parameter    @xmath149    when @xmath150 .",

    "we estimated the ratio parameter by the perturbative a - p splitting functions , it is just the ratio of color factors .",
    "we assume the parameter value is still similar in the nonperturbative region .",
    "the nonsensitive parameter @xmath156 also can be derived by above method .",
    "but , it is relevant to the integration limit or @xmath155 scale .",

    "<S> , we introduced variable splitting rates representing the details of the dynamics as model parameters which were not considered in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on model parameters was studied , and it was found that the sea quark flavor asymmetry weakly depends on model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it reflects the statistics principle contributes the dominant part of the asymmetry and the effect caused by details of the dynamics is small . </S>",
    "<S> we also applied the monte carlo approach of the statistical model to predict the theoretical sea quark asymmetries in kaons , octet baryons @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 baryons , even in exotic pentaquark states . </S>"
