    "we also applied galactic reddening corrections interpolated from the @xcite maps using the reddening curve of @xcite .",
    "we inserted the resulting artificial galaxies into each lens field and recovered them using sextractor .",
    "each run included 365 artificial galaxies : 350 randomly scattered throughout the field and an additional 15 within @xmath144of the lens .",
    "we considered an artificial galaxy recovered if its centroid was within 2.5 pixels and its @xmath28 magnitude and color were within 1.0 mag of the input values .",
    "fifty runs were performed in each lens field to build up statistics .",
    "we plot the results from the artificial galaxy tests in a typical field ( b1422 ) in figure [ fig.artgal ] .",
    "two systematic issues are readily observed .",
    "the recovered galaxy magnitudes consistently underestimated the flux , the effect being greatest for the brightest galaxies .",
    "this underestimate is due to the low surface brightness outer regions of an elliptical galaxy not being detected by sextractor .",
    "the effect is strongest at bright luminosities because intrinsically bright ellipticals have the most diffuse surface brightness profiles .",
    "the net effect is to amplify the number of galaxies around @xmath126 and suppress the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath145 . for galaxies in these",
    "magnitude ranges , another method of measuring magnitudes ( such as profile fitting ) is necessary to accurately determine the total luminosity .",
    "nevertheless , we did not attempt to correct the photometric catalog for these systematic magnitude offsets for two reasons .",
    "first , our method of measuring magnitudes is in common use ; correcting to total magnitudes would hinder comparisons with other samples .",
    "second , the exact offset depends on the input galaxy luminosity profile .",
    "our tests were limited to bulge - dominated galaxies , so we could not estimate the corrections for disk - dominated galaxies . in future work",
    "we will perform detailed profile fits to the galaxies near the lens systems to address this systematic effect carefully .    for the brightest bins in the figure ,",
    "the completeness is low because the central regions of bright galaxies are flagged as saturated . in order to determine if this saturation affects our results , we visually inspect objects flagged as saturated in a subset of the fields .",
    "while a handful of bright galaxies in each field are flagged as saturated , in no case are the flagged galaxies potential group members ; these galaxies are either more than several arcminutes from the lens or obviously foreground , with magnitudes significantly brighter and physical extents significantly larger than any other galaxy near the lens .    given that galaxies in groups tend to be clustered , we test whether crowding ( i.e. , the blending of overlapping galaxies ) could be a significant source of incompleteness in our data .",
    "overall , we find that the completeness within @xmath144of the lens is similar to that in the remainder of the field . in some fields , such as b1422 ( figure [ fig.artgal ] )",
    ", we find the completeness within @xmath144of the lens is slightly higher than in the field as a whole .",
    "in other fields the completeness is slightly lower .",
    "these small completeness variations are most likely due to statistical fluctuations resulting from the smaller number of artificial galaxies used to calculate the completeness in the relatively small area surrounding the lens as compared to the much larger area of the complete mosaic field .",
    "we therefore conclude that crowding is not an issue in our data .",
    "given the uncertainties in the model galaxies , the ( ignored ) scatter in the kormendy relation , and the fact that the input artificial galaxies are solely early - type galaxies at a fixed redshift , the completeness is not necessarily valid outside the red sequence and is subject to uncertain systematics .",
    "however , the observed field - to - field stability of the completeness , despite differing lens redshifts , seeing , and field depth , suggests that our completeness calculations are relatively robust .",
    "due to the morphology - density relation , the early - type fraction is higher in overdense regions like groups and clusters of galaxies than elsewhere . in such cases , one observes a `` red sequence '' ( rs ) of elliptical and s0 galaxies in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of galaxies in the region .",
    "the rs forms the basis for our successful two - band photometric detection of galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "our rs detection algorithm is a modified version of that presented by @xcite .",
    "their algorithm searches color and astrometric space for localized enhancements of early - type galaxies at similar redshifts and has proven successful in locating group - mass structures over a wide range in redshift using data from optical imaging surveys . as our survey",
    "is targeted toward the immediate environment of lenses , we do not need to include the spatial filtering in our selection .",
    "the other major difference between our algorithm and that of @xcite is that we include human interaction in the selection process . while this introduces a hard - to - quantify bias into the resulting group sample , it enables us to detect less - massive groups ( @xmath146 ) . as shown in ",
    "[ spec.comp ] , the resulting group catalog is nearly complete with few false detections , suggesting that any bias introduced by the human interaction is small .",
    "our basic rs detection algorithm is as follows .",
    "first we search within @xmath144of the lens galaxy for an excess of galaxies with similar colors above the measured background color distribution .",
    "we fit an rs to these galaxies , and calculate the projected spatial centroid of the candidate group . using the rs fit and centroid , we repeat this search to ensure that the group is not spurious and to refine the rs parameters and centroid measurement .",
    "we continue the iterative process until the changes in the centroid and the rs parameters are within the calculated errors .",
    "the first time we apply this algorithm to a field , we focus on galaxy colors near that of an early - type galaxy at the lens redshift , @xmath127 .",
    "we then search for line - of - sight groups by repeating the algorithm until we have investigated all peaks in the initial color distribution .",
    "we assume an rs of the form @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the slope of the rs , and @xmath149 is the unreddened observed @xmath150 color of an @xmath1 galaxy at the lens redshift . for fields with @xmath30-band imaging",
    ", we use this same relation with @xmath29 replaced by @xmath30 .",
    "we allow both the rs slope @xmath148 and the group redshift , which determines @xmath126 and @xmath149 , to vary freely .",
    "we calculate the initial @xmath149 and @xmath126 from the galaxy models described in appendix a and the known @xmath127 .",
    "the rs slope has been found to have values around @xmath151 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because the color - magnitude relation is difficult to model properly , and because our bandpasses do not correspond exactly to rest - frame @xmath152 and @xmath29 , it does not necessarily follow that this slope can be directly compared with the @xmath150 or @xmath33 slopes of the groups in this paper .",
    "however , we show in  [ sec.results.sample ] that the actual fit slopes from our sample are indistinguishable from this value .",
    "we therefore initially set @xmath153 .",
    "although this could bias the final fit slopes , we show in  [ sec.algorithm.tests ] that we can recover the correct rs slope even if this initial assumed value is incorrect .    for the first iteration of our rs search , we limit the search to within @xmath144(@xmath154 ) of the lens galaxy . this radius is large enough ( @xmath155@xmath156 ) to include most of the line - of - sight structures that could impact lens models ( see * ?",
    "it is possible that a massive galaxy cluster could lie outside this radius and still alter the lens potential , so we estimate the fraction of lenses affected by such a cluster as follows .",
    "we consider a lens model perturbation significant if the convergence @xmath157 . from eqn .",
    "a20 in @xcite , we find that the maximum impact parameter @xmath158 that a cluster can have and significantly impact the lens model is @xmath159 , where @xmath158 is in arcminutes and @xmath3 is the cluster velocity dispersion in km s@xmath19 .",
    "this conservatively assumes that the cluster is at the lens redshift ; for clusters at other redshifts , @xmath158 will be smaller . for a galaxy cluster with @xmath160 km s@xmath19 , the median velocity dispersion for rich abell clusters @xcite , @xmath161",
    " close to the radius within which we search anyway .",
    "the surface density of galaxy clusters is @xmath162 per sq .",
    "degree ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath163 , correcting for their 30% false detection rate ) . on average , this results in 0.07 galaxy clusters within @xmath158 .",
    "we consider this to be an upper limit , given that we are already searching for groups and clusters out to a significant fraction of @xmath158 and that @xmath158 is smaller if there is any redshift difference between the cluster and the lens .",
    "we therefore conclude it is unlikely that any significant perturbing structures lie outside our search radius .",
    "we correct galaxy magnitudes for interstellar extinction and reddening using standard galactic extinction @xcite with @xmath164 and extinctions from @xcite obtained from the nasa extragalactic database .",
    "we do not attempt any corrections for differential galactic extinction across the field ; any variations within @xmath144of the lens are likely to be negligible at the galactic latitudes of these lenses . as is common practice , extinction - corrected magnitudes and colors",
    "are denoted by the subscript `` 0 . ''    to account for the slope of the rs , we define an `` effective color '' for each galaxy : @xmath165 this represents the color each galaxy would have if it resided on the rs and had an apparent magnitude @xmath166 . this definition is useful because all rs galaxies in a group should have the same effective color .",
    "hence , we can identify rss as peaks in a histogram of effective color , providing an efficient way of searching for groups of early - type galaxies .",
    "the search for peaks in the effective color histograms is also adept at identifying groups with high late - type fractions , as blue galaxies in a group will all have roughly similar colors , although in the absence of morphological or spectroscopic data to classify the galaxies as late - types , the derived redshift of the group will be incorrect ( see  [ sec.algorithm.tests ] ) .",
    "we compute effective color histograms for galaxies within @xmath144of the lens galaxy , as well as for all galaxies in the image ( normalized to the area within @xmath144 ) .",
    "the number density of field galaxies as a function of apparent magnitude has a steeper slope than typical group luminosity functions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it is possible to choose a magnitude limit that maximizes the contrast between the rs and the field galaxy distribution .",
    "this magnitude limit will vary from field to field depending on the richness of the group and statistical fluctuations in the number of background galaxies .",
    "our empirical testing finds that , in most cases , the best contrast between the group and the field is achieved for a limiting magnitude of @xmath167 .",
    "we therefore consider only galaxies brighter than @xmath168 throughout this algorithm .",
    "we visually examine the effective histograms for an excess of galaxies of a similar effective colors relative to the normalized field background , an indication of a possible group .",
    "we select all galaxies within a distance @xmath169 of the peak in the effective color histogram as candidate rs galaxies .",
    "@xmath169 to be the larger of the photometric color error and 0.05 mags , the typical rs scatter in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the photometric color errors are typically larger than the intrinsic scatter for @xmath39 .",
    "we use linear regression to fit a linear rs to the selected galaxies brighter than @xmath168 , thereby refining the rs slope @xmath148 and intercept . from this fit",
    "we determine the new values of @xmath149 , @xmath126 , and the rs redshift @xmath170 based on the early - type galaxy photometric models ( appendix a ) .",
    "as discussed in appendix a , we note that changes in the assumed normalization of @xmath126 results in systematic changes in @xmath170 , though for the range of published values of @xmath1 , this bias is @xmath171 .",
    "we also calculate the raw and luminosity - weighted group centroids of the rs galaxies .    at this point",
    ", we can either accept or reject the new parameter values and then choose whether another iteration should be performed .",
    "changes in redshift cause the projected angular size of @xmath144to be recomputed , and changes in the centroids adjust the area of sky in which galaxies are examined .",
    "the iterative process continues until the change in the rs redshift between iterations is less than @xmath172 and the shift in the centroid is less than @xmath173 . if multiple peaks in the color distribution are observed , we repeat the entire process on each potential rs . for the purpose of this paper , we define `` significant '' candidate rss as those with at least three selected galaxies above the averaged background persisting for at least two iterations , criteria that produce the best results in tests with mock groups ( see  [ sec.algorithm.tests ] ) .",
    "an example of this process applied to the lens b1422 is shown in figure  [ fig.b1422_ex ] .",
    "we see an rs of galaxies at @xmath174 , roughly the effective color of early - type galaxies at @xmath127and also the approximate color of the lens galaxy . at brighter magnitudes",
    ", the group luminosity function clearly dominates that of the field . a map of the galaxies in this range ( fig .",
    "[ fig.b1422_ex]c ) shows that the collection of bright galaxies , and therefore the group , is nearly centered on the lens galaxy and is elongated .",
    "this figure shows that our group detection algorithm is capable of detecting physical groups and constraining the group redshift , richness , centroid , and shape .",
    "we note that some of the bright galaxies in the selected rs may not be group members but rather higher - redshift blue galaxies . in the future",
    ", we will also perform a morphological analysis , which should separate background disk - dominated galaxies from the early - type rs group members . for now , we make two tests of the algorithm , one using simulated groups of galaxies (  [ sec.algorithm.tests ] ) , the other using spectroscopy of eight of the twelve lens fields to verify rs membership (  [ spec.comp ] ) .",
    "we test our rs search algorithm by inserting mock galaxy groups into each field s galaxy catalog .",
    "we construct mock photometric groups from empirical luminosity functions .",
    "the early - type fraction and number of bright group galaxies are readily modified to simulate galaxy groups of different richnesses .",
    "the precise luminosity function does not significantly affect the success of the algorithm .",
    "we begin by creating a mock group galaxy catalog designed to cover a range of redshifts ( @xmath175 ) , early - type fractions ( @xmath176 ) , rs slopes ( @xmath1770.05 , 0.10 , 0.15 ) , and richnesses .",
    "we define the mock group richness by the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath178 , and our mock groups are designed to have richnesses of 4 , 8 , or 16 .",
    "a richness of 4 corresponds to local group analogues .",
    "we derive cumulative luminosity functions from the empirical group luminosity functions presented in @xcite to determine that richnesses of 8 and 16 correspond to velocity dispersions of @xmath179 and @xmath180 , respectively , though there is significant scatter in this relation .",
    "we select the luminosity function for each group from the empirical luminosity functions derived from gems data @xcite .",
    "that study presents different luminosity functions for x - ray bright ( @xmath181 ) and x - ray faint / undetected groups .",
    "this luminosity break corresponds to a velocity dispersion of @xmath182 km s@xmath19@xcite , so we use the gems empirical x - ray faint luminosity function for groups with richness 4 and the x - ray bright luminosity function for groups with richness 8 or 16 .",
    "we assign each mock galaxy an @xmath28 magnitude drawn randomly from a distribution defined by the appropriate luminosity function .",
    "we then label each galaxy an early- or late - type with a probability based on the input early - type fraction ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "late - type galaxies are further divided with equal probability into sa , sb , and sc types .",
    "we assign colors based on the appropriate photometric model ( appendix a ) for the assigned morphology , and , for early - types , we place the galaxy on the rs with a selected rs slope between @xmath184 and 0.15 .",
    "we add gaussian scatter of @xmath185 mag , similar to the observed scatter in other rs studies , to each mock galaxy s color .",
    "we also add additional scatter to the @xmath28 magnitude and color of each galaxy to simulate the photometric errors based on the photometric accuracy determined from the artificial galaxy tests (  [ sec.complete ] ) .",
    "we now need to assign positional data to each galaxy . to simulate the foreground and background galaxies in the field , we assign the cataloged galaxies random @xmath186- and @xmath187-positions in the b1422 field ( chosen to be a representative lens field ) , thereby mixing any actual galaxy groups and clusters into the field galaxy population .",
    "we assume that all mock group galaxies lie within @xmath144of the lens , and we assign these galaxies positions drawn randomly from a 2-dimensional gaussian density function centered on the lens position .",
    "we then run the group finding algorithm on the combined catalog .",
    "we consider a mock group to be recovered if we find a candidate rs with an effective color within 0.2 of the input group s color , a value similar to our input color errors .",
    "this criterion prevents the detection of spurious groups , i.e. , those containing none of the input mock galaxies .",
    "we make an exception to this criterion if the group has a high late - type fraction , in which case there often is a false rs created by having many blue galaxies with similar colors . in this circumstance ,",
    "the group is considered recovered despite having an effective color @xmath1880.2 mag bluer than that of a true rs at the group redshift . in group catalogs based on our actual data , groups with high late - type fractions",
    "would be labeled line - of - sight groups .",
    "our knowledge of the mock group color could potentially bias the group finding algorithm toward detection of the mock group .",
    "however , we also know the redshifts ( and therefore expected rs colors ) of the lenses in the present sample , so any bias for detecting groups at @xmath127and the mock groups is the same .",
    "the small number of interloping groups identified from spectroscopy that are undetected photometrically ( see  [ spec.comp ] ) argues that this bias is also small for line - of - sight group detection .",

    "distant , high-@xmath3 ( @xmath13300500 km s@xmath19 ) groups , @xcite found that the lack of a significant offset of the bgg from the group centroid is similar to that observed in nearby groups .",
    "given the larger sample offered by this photometric study , we identify the bgg in each candidate group and examine its relation to the group centroid . as bggs at low redshift are typically ellipticals , we assume here that the brightest galaxy on the selected rs ( brsg , for brightest red sequence galaxy ) is the bgg .",
    "the properties of the brsg in each group are given in table  [ tab.brsg ] .",
    "only two lens galaxies , rxj1131 and mg1654 , are brsgs .",
    "we also note that two brsgs , those in b2114 group 1 and he2149 group 4 , are known not to be the bgg as their redshifts are inconsistent with group membership .",
    "the fraction of lens galaxies that are brsgs is 0.25 ( two lenses out of eight lens groups ) ; @xcite find a bgg fraction of 0.33 ( two lenses out of six lens groups ) .",
    "these values compare favorably with the suggestion by @xcite than @xmath326 of lens galaxies occupy the dominant halo , the remainder being `` satellite '' galaxies , or sub - halos within the overall group halo .",
    "this result is also not surprising in light of our conclusion in  [ sec.lensmagdist ] that the lens galaxy is typically not a very luminous galaxy .",

    "our data therefore intimate that there are dynamically evolved ( i.e. , virialized ) groups with high @xmath3 and a central , dominant early - type member by @xmath4 , groups whose properties are consistent with evolved ( virialized ) groups in the nearby universe .",
    "one unsolved puzzle in lensing studies is why there are so many quadruple - image lenses compared with double - image lenses @xcite .",
    "highly - flattened lens galaxies are one way to obtain the seemingly high numbers of quad lenses ; another possibility is the presence of a large tidal shear from mass near the lens galaxy or along the line - of - sight . in this latter scenario ,",
    "quad lenses might be expected to be located preferentially in complex environments or along cluttered lines of sight .",
    "indeed , @xcite note that in a sample of eight lenses , both of the quad lenses and the one quad / ring lens are in relatively massive groups , while another ring and two of the doubles are in poorer groups , and the other two doubles have no groups around the lens galaxies .",
    "photometrically , we find some weak evidence that quad lenses may have more complex environments than double lenses .",
    "three of the four quad lenses and all three `` other '' lenses have associated rss , while only two of the five double - image lenses have rss . however ,",
    "this difference is not statistically significant ; larger samples are needed to make any definitive statement .",
    "the lack of strong evidence for a difference between quad and double lens environments contrasts with our findings in @xcite .",
    "the difference may simply reflect small number statistics .",
    "a more likely explanation is that the results in m06 were based on detailed calculations of the convergence and shear due to each lens environment  calculations we can not make in this paper because we do not know the true memberships and velocity dispersions for all of our groups .",
    "our complete lens sample will enable us to reexamine any connections between image number and environment that may be hidden in the noise of our current sample .",
    "we find no correlation between the number of lensed images and the presence / absence of line - of - sight structures .",
    "three of the four quads , three of the five doubles , and two of the three `` others '' have at least one line - of - sight structure identified photometrically .",

    "we have presented the first results from an on - going wide - field imaging survey of @xmath14 strong gravitational lens systems .",
    "we use a modified version of the @xcite group - finding algorithm to locate potential red sequences , both at the lens redshift and along the line - of - sight , in the fields of twelve lenses .",
    "this modified algorithm is capable of detecting @xmath552 km s@xmath19 poor groups out to @xmath324 , and higher-@xmath3 groups out to higher redshifts with a low rate of false positives and reasonable completeness .    we draw the following conclusions :    * most gravitational lenses lie in complex environments . for this sample , 67% of lens galaxies ( eight of twelve )",
    "lie in galaxy groups . as there are no strong biases in this sample ,",
    "is is unlikely this fraction would drop below @xmath553 once the environments of all lenses are surveyed .",
    "* most gravitational lenses have interloping structures .",
    "in particular , we detect ten groups projected within @xmath554 of seven lenses ; i.e. , @xmath555 of the lenses in this sample have at least one interloping group that could impact the lens model ( see also momcheva et al .",
    "* the centroid positions of the lens groups are consistent with the directions of the external shears required by lens models , for the six systems where we can make the comparison .",
    "this suggests that lens environments can explain the model shears  which has often been assumed , but not well proven . in at least one system ( mg0751 ) ,",
    "the agreement is seen only when the full virial extent of the group is included . *",
    "the typical gravitational lens is not a super-@xmath1 elliptical .",
