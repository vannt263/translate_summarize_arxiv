    "the search for a description of heavy quarkonia at finite temperature in terms of a nonrelativistic schrdinger equation with an instantaneous potential has a long history .",
    "ever since matsui and satz @xcite proposed the melting of the @xmath0 particle as signal for the deconfinement transition in heavy ion collisions , it has been the goal for theory to put their phenomenological arguments on a solid field theoretical footing .",
    "the success of relativistic heavy ion experimental groups to indeed measure suppression patterns at rhic and lhc @xcite has further invigorated interest in the topic .",
    "even though initial attempts focussed mainly on model potentials @xcite , the last decade has seen technical advances that allow us to actually derive a potential from the underlying theory of strong interactions qcd via a systematic coarse graining procedure .",
    "based on the concept of effective field theories ( eft ) such as pnrqcd @xcite or quantum mechanical path integrals @xcite , the static part of the in - medium potential can be readily defined from the late - time limit of the real - time wilson loop @xcite .    using the hard thermal loop approximation , laine et .",
    "@xcite succeeded in calculating the real - time wilson loop to first non - trivial order and obtained a closed expression for the potential .",
    "they found a real part featuring debye screening and an imaginary part , which was attributed to landau damping @xcite .",
    "first corrections to this quantity in an effective field theory approach were derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and the corresponding quarkonium spectral functions were computed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "questions remain however , such as how the confining , i.e. linear part of the potential of the hadronic phase behaves when approaching and surpassing the deconfinement temperature .",
    "hence we are urged to extend the results of perturbative calculations into the non - perturbative regime .",
    "one path that has proven viable in spectral studies of heavy quarkonium @xcite is the use of lattice regularized qcd , which is amenable to monte carlo simulations at any temperature .",
    "as non - perturbative calculations of the wilson loop based on lattice qcd are only possible in euclidean time , we face the challenging task to connect imaginary time information with real - time dynamics in the definition of the potential . a recent study @xcite suggested that the use of wilson loop spectral functions and the investigation of their peak structure allows a non - perturbative extraction of both real and imaginary part of the potential . at the heart of this procedure",
    "is the correct determination of the shape of the lowest lying spectral peak .    from the point of view of the present study",
    ", the authors in @xcite assumed that the scales of early time ( bound state formation ) and late time ( potential ) physics are completely separated .",
    "hence they fitted the spectrum with a simple breit - wigner and used its peak position and width to determine @xmath1 . in the following we wish to demonstrate that such an assumption is not valid in general and one has to take into account modifications to the spectrum that arise from a coupling of the timescales .",
    "these lead to a skewing and shifting of the breit - wigner shape .    after deriving the shape of the lowest lying peak on general grounds in section [ sec",
    ": sp ] , we apply the functional form to the highest temperature data of ref .",
    "@xcite and show in section [ sec : lqcd ] that the resulting potential is compatible with a scenario of heavy @xmath2 in a deconfined screening plasma .",
    "the counterintuitive , large rise of the real part of the potential found in ref .",
    "@xcite disappears as a result of the improved fit .",
    "in order to define a potential for static heavy quarks , we rely on the eft framework .",
    "as the constituents of the @xmath2 system are heavy ( @xmath3 ) and their velocities @xmath4 are small , there exists a hierarchy of scales @xmath5 according to which an eft description can be constructed .    in a first step",
    "the hard scale is integrated out to give the theory of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , where the heavy quarks are described by two - component pauli spinors .",
    "one can proceed by integrating out the soft scale for the medium degrees of freedom to end up with the theory of potential nrqcd ( pnrqcd ) where color singlets and octets are the dynamical fields .",
    "the matching between qcd and the eft tells us that the time evolution of the wilson loop @xcite @xmath6\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general follows @xmath7 with a time dependent complex function @xmath8 that asymptotes to the singlet potential @xmath9    to connect this formalism to lattice qcd observables , we deploy a spectral decomposition @xcite of the wilson loop @xmath10 which allows us to extract the potential via @xmath11    we note that if a well defined lowest lying spectral peak exists , it will eventually dominate the dynamics in the late time limit and thus encodes all necessary information on the potential . in the following we will therefore calculate the shape of the low lying peak , starting from the general equations ( [ eq : wilsonlooptimeevol],[eq : potasympt ] ) . to this end",
    ", we rewrite the function @xmath12 , where the time dependent part @xmath13 vanishes after a characteristic time @xmath14 .",
    "intuitively @xmath14 is the time needed for the two body system of quark and anti - quark to form a bound state described by the static potential @xmath1 .",

    ", these two coefficients have to be considered no matter what fitting range is chosen .",
    "we recover a time independent potential if the spectral function ( [ eq : fitshapefull ] ) is plugged back into eq.([eq : defspecpot ] ) .",

    "the aim of extracting the potential from spectral functions was to open a window into the non - perturbative context of lattice qcd .",
    "monte carlo simulations allow the discrete estimation of correlation functions , such as the wilson loop , in euclidean time . to connect the real - time potential of eq . and simulated data @xmath33 , we have to invert the following laplace transformation @xmath34    the problem we face is ill - defined , since we wish to extract an almost continuous function from a discrete and noisy set of points .",
    "fortunately , according to the discussion following eq .",
    ", we are interested only in the lowest lying peak of the spectrum .",
    "this part of the spectrum is amenable to analysis via the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite , a form of bayesian inference . in practice",
    "its results can depend strongly on the quality of the data , i.e. the available signal to noise ratio . even though the position of peaks can be determined reliably",
    ", the error in the width of spectral structures is more difficult to ascertain , due to the confluence of systematics and statistics .    in the following",
    ", we will apply the improved fitting functions of eq . to the datasets of @xcite .",
    "spectra are available based on quenched lattice qcd data from configurations with @xmath35 , a bare anisotropy of @xmath36 and extend @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which yields @xmath39 and corresponds to the three temperatures @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively @xcite . for the case of the highest temperature ,",
    "the number of datapoints is quite small for the use in mem , so we provide lattice data as a crosscheck at a more finely spaced setting of @xmath42 , which together with @xmath43 yields a lattice spacing of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : wloopmemspecfits233 ] shows two wilson loop spectra from the coarser lattice at @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which are fitted within the shaded region by a naive lorentian ( l ) , a skewed lorentian ( sl , @xmath47 ) and the skewed lorentian with up to quadratic background terms ( sql , @xmath48 ) .",
    "we find that the peaks are much better reproduced , once the fitting function takes into account at least @xmath31 and slightly improve with additional @xmath49 .",
    "the improved fit is stable against a change of the fitting range and against considering additional @xmath49 . especially in the right hand panel of fig.[fig : wloopmemspecfits233 ] it is obvious that a large background contribution interferes strongly with a naive lorentian fit of the peak .",
    "note that in the wilson loop case at @xmath46 the signal to background ratio is relatively small , hence we only show data up to this distance .",
    "the values for the real part of the potential @xmath50 from the coarse and fine lattice ( the @xmath42 points being shifted to account for the different renormalization scale ) can be found in the left panel of fig.[fig : wlooprealimagpotmem233 ] . while the naive lorentian fit denoted by ( l )",
    "shows a very strong rise in @xmath51(r)$ ] , similar to the one observed in @xcite , improving the fitting function diminishes this effect significantly .",
    "we find that at small @xmath52 , the real part @xmath51(r)$ ] coincides within its errorbars , with the temperature independent part of the the color singlet free energies and then appears to become slightly larger than @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "most importantly we now understand that the previously observed extremely strong rise in the real part can be attributed to the presence of scale coupling not accounted for in the breit - wigner fitting function .",
    "the imaginary part on the other hand does not change significantly under the improved fitting .",
    "how much of the spectral width corresponds to a physical width or is induced by an artificial broadening of the mem is however difficult to establish . without question",
    "a width is present due to the observed curvature in the euclidean data .",
    "nevertheless until a follow up investigation based on e.g. the multilevel algorithm @xcite can simulate the wilson loop at any separation distance with equally small relative errors , we suggest to take the right hand side of fig.[fig : wlooprealimagpotmem233 ] as a qualitative result .",
    "one challenging aspect of the lattice qcd determination of the potential is that the wilson loop in euclidean time becomes more and more suppressed at intermediate @xmath55 , with increasing spatial distance .",
    "this suppression in turn translates into a decreasing amplitude of the lowest lying peak , which hence becomes very hard to extract for @xmath56 just where the non - perturbative range sets in .    to mitigate these adverse effects",
    ", the authors of @xcite also considered an alternative observable , i.e. the wilson line correlator @xmath57 in coulomb gauge , to define a potential @xmath58 in eq .. the benefit of using this gauge fixed quantity is that it shows much less suppression in the early @xmath55 and late @xmath59 region , which are assumed not to contribute to the values of the potential but can complicate their extraction @xcite .",
    "the shape of the spectra from the wilson line correlator for the coarser lattice tell us that the background contributions are significantly reduced compared to the wilson loop case .",
    "we are thus able to identify a well defined peak up to distances of @xmath60 . at small separation distances @xmath61 , the naive fitting with a lorentian and the improved fitting functions yield a very similar peak position . only by going to larger separation distances",
    "the improved fitting gives significantly better results .",
    "turning to the reconstructed values of the potential @xmath58 from the coarse and fine lattice as shown in fig.[fig : wlinerealimagpotmem233 ] , we find that the real part shows a behavior much closer to intuition as was found without improved fitting functions",
    ". instead of a perpetual linear rise , @xmath62(r)$ ] grows only until distances of @xmath63 , where it begins to flatten off to a value slightly larger than the color - singlet free energies .",
    "note that the real part of @xmath58 and @xmath50 mostly agree within their error bars in the range where @xmath50 can be determined .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath64(r)$ ] is however smaller than @xmath65(r)$ ] , which could be a sign of better acuity in the spectral peaks due to a higher signal to noise ratio .",
    "we have shown that the coupling of early and late time scales leads to spectral structures different from a breit - wigner , which have to be taken into account to extract the heavy quark potential reliably .",
    "after deriving improved fitting functions in , we applied them to the non - perturbative wilson loop spectra and found that the fits reconstruct all spectral functions excellently , which is by far not the case for the lorentian . with our improved fitting , we are able to determine a real- and imaginary part of the potential , which is compatible with the presence of a deconfined and screening quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the error bars for the extracted values of the potential , especially in the case of the wilson loop , are still relatively large .",
    "thus to make more quantitative statements in the future , efforts need to be continued to increase the signal to noise ratio of the euclidean correlator data in order for the mem to improve .",
