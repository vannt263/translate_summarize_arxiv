    "recently , @xcite revealed a unique elemental abundance pattern in a carbon - rich extremely metal - poor star cs29498 - 043 .",
    "the chemical composition of cs29498 - 043 has a large excess of @xmath0-elements such as mg and si as well as c and n compared to fe - group elements .",
    "a similar characteristic was previously identified in another c - rich star cs22949 - 037 @xcite . in cs22949 - 037",
    ", oxygen is also found to be significantly overabundant @xcite .",
    "since a mixing process at the asymptotic giant branch of stellar evolution enhances exclusively c and n , the lack of fe is likely to give rise to the enhancements of c , n , mg and si @xcite .",
    "the lack of fe , of course , must be initially imprinted in stars at formation because the low - mass stars considered here are unable to destroy fe nuclei in their envelope .",
    "recent studies on the chemical compositions of metal - poor halo stars have claimed that these stars might have inherited the abundance pattern for the ejecta of the preceding few supernovae ( sne ) @xcite or a single sn ( * ? ? ?",
    "* st98 in the following ) .",
    "if this is the case , these stars would have formed from the interstellar matter ( ism ) comprising the ejecta of a single sn .",
    "@xcite compared the relative elemental abundances observed in cs22949 - 037 with those of the theoretical sn models proposed by @xcite and obtained fairly good agreement with a particular model .",
    "furthermore , since the mass of the ism eventually swept up by the preceding sn is theoretically derived , the observed abundance ratios with respect to h on the surfaces of stars would allow the mass of each element contained in the sn to be estimated ( st98 ; * ? ? ?",
    "a comparison of the derived mass of each element with that of theoretical sn models also leads to the conclusion that the apparent enhancement of @xmath0-elements in the above two stars is a result of the deficiency of fe in the ejecta of the preceding sn ( see  2 for quantitative discussion ) .",
    "this indicates that there existed subluminous sne with a small amount of @xmath1ni as a heat source , which decays to @xmath1fe through @xmath1co with a half - life of @xmath277 d.    the least luminous sne ever observed , sn 1997d @xcite and sn 1999br ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , are in fact fe - poor . from analyses of the light curve of sn 1997d @xcite",
    ", it has been found that this sn ejects only @xmath3 of @xmath1ni .",
    "the explosion energy @xmath4 is estimated to be @xmath5 erg and the progenitor mass to be @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite reported that sn 1999br ejects a similar amount of @xmath1ni ( @xmath7 ) with an explosion energy of @xmath8 erg and that the ejected mass , which gives the lower bound of the progenitor mass , has been estimated to be 14 @xmath9 from the light curve analyses .",
    "it is well known that there is a distinct class of sne with similar progenitor mass that yield fe comparable to sn 1987a or slightly higher ( @xmath10 , e.g. , st98 ) .",
    "such sne will be referred to as _",
    "normal _ sne in the following .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the low fe mass of sn 1997d may be due to fallback of material onto the collapsed remnant . in this case , fe as well as other fe - group elements such as cr , mn , co and ni produced in the deep interior of the core would fall back .",
    "in contrast , lighter elements synthesized in the outer layers of the star would be ejected and be excluded from any fallback . as a result , lighter elements are significantly enhanced with respect to fe - group elements .",
    "the observed elemental abundance patterns of cs29498 - 043 and cs22949 - 037 exhibit characteristics that fit this explanation .    in the next section",
    ", the features of sne that induced the formation of the stars cs29498 - 043 and cs22949 - 037 will be deduced from the observed elemental abundance pattern in light of the sn - induced star formation scenario proposed by st98 .",
    "subsequently in  3 , nucleosynthesis for fe - group elements is discussed based on the implications of the [ cr , mn , co / fe ] ratios observed in these two stars , which is surprisingly at variance with the present theoretical expectations from spherically symmetric sn models .",
    "the subluminous sne discovered so far are less energetic varieties of sne , although theoretically some energetic sne with high masses such as 35 could also be subluminous @xcite .",
    "such low energy reduces the mass @xmath11 of ism ( mostly hydrogen ) eventually swept up by a subluminous sn , obeying the relation @xmath12 ( st98 ) . since the metallicity [ x / h ] of extremely metal - poor stars born from the ism swept up by a sn remnant ( snr ) is inversely proportional to @xmath11 , stars that inherit the ejecta of a subluminous sn should have larger [ x / h ] as long as the other conditions are the same .",
    "as discussed in st98 , the abundance ratios [ mg / h ] in metal - poor stars can be used as an indicator of the progenitor mass of the sn inducing the formation of the stars , since theoretical models for massive stars predict that the mass of mg inside a star increases with increasing stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the amount of ejected lighter elements such as mg can be predicted more precisely than that of heavier elements such as fe because the ejection of the outer layer is less affected by theoretical uncertainty concerning the sn explosion mechanism ( see , however , model z20a of * ? ? ? * for example ) .",
    "the relationships between the metallicity [ mg / h ] of stars and the mass @xmath13 of the sn progenitor thus obtained are shown in figure 1 for @xmath14 erg ( _ solid line _ ) and @xmath15 erg ( _ dotted line _ ) , assuming the metallicity [ mg / h ] of stars born from the shell formed by an snr is approximated well by the average [ mg / h ] inside the ism swept up by the snr .",
    "if cs29498 - 043 inherited the ejecta of a subluminous sn with explosion energy equal to that of sn 1997d , the sn progenitor mass becomes 25 , which intriguingly agrees with that inferred from the light curve analyses of sn 1997d .",
    "the sn progenitor mass for cs22949 - 037 estimated in the same manner is @xmath16 .",
    "the masses of ejected fe are estimated to be 0.006 ( cs29498 - 043 ) and 0.003 ( cs22949 - 037 ) using the observed [ fe / h ] ratios for the two stars and assuming @xmath14 erg .",
    "both of the estimated fe masses indicate subluminous sne such as sne 1997d and 1999br .",
    "figure 2 shows the enhancement factors of each element defined by the abundance ratios of the element with respect to fe in the metal - poor stars discussed in this letter relative to those ratios in the ejecta of normal sne with the corresponding progenitor masses .",
    "the abundances of normal sne have been inferred from the elemental abundance pattern observed for metal - poor stars in the manner described in @xcite .",
    "thus derived abundance ratios correspond to the average values of metal - poor stars observed by @xcite at the metallicity of [ mg / h]@xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "that is , an sn with @xmath15 erg and @xmath19 will imprint a metallicity [ mg / h]@xmath20 on the descendant stars , while an sn with the same energy but with @xmath21 corresponds to [ mg / h]@xmath22 . as seen in figure 2 , the abundance of elements heavier than si in these stars is at least a factor of 5 smaller than the average value of metal - poor stars , which is attributed to fallback onto the remnant in subluminous sne .",
    "a moderate enhancement factor for si in comparison with fe - group elements might imply that fallback occurred inside the si layer . the enhancement factors for ca through co",
    "have similar values in cs22949 - 037 , while cr through fe are simlar in cs29498 - 043 .",
    "a good coincidence in the enhancement factors is seen especially in cs22949 - 037 , probably due to more accurate abundance determinations .",
    "this result suggests that there is little difference in the ratios of ca , cr , mn , or co to fe between subluminous sne and normal sne with the same progenitor mass , with intriguing implications for nucleosynthesis , explosion , and mixing in sn models .",
    "figure 3 shows the observed correlations between [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , [ co / fe ] and [ mg / h ] for metal - poor halo stars @xcite , cs29498 - 043 , and cs22949 - 037 .",
    "as shown in these figures , the observed [ cr , mn , co / fe ] trends are quite clear ; the [ cr , mn / fe ] ratios increase with increasing [ mg / h ] , whereas the [ co / fe ] ratio decreases .",
    "these clear correlations suggest that the [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , [ co / fe ] ratios are closely correlated with the sn progenitor mass @xcite , while the abundance ratios of @xmath0-elements such as mg , si , and ca to fe do not have clear correlations .",
    "it is also clear from the same figure that the observed [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , [ co / fe ] ratios of cs29498 - 043 and cs22949 - 037 do not follow the trend presented by the other stars .",
    "five horizontal arrows in this figure indicate how these ratios would shift when these stars inherited the ejecta of an sn with @xmath15 erg instead of @xmath23 erg .",
    "the lengths of the horizontal shifts correspond to differences in the swept - up hydrogen mass between sne with @xmath14 and @xmath24 erg .",
    "all the arrows pointing to the lines of the best fit for the observational data by @xmath25 test , suggesting that the [ mn / fe ] , [ cr / fe ] , and [ co / fe ] ratios of these two stars do not deviate from those of normal sne with the same progenitor mass , although for cs29498 - 043 an uncertainty remains due to the large error in the observed [ mn / fe ] ratio and a lack of co data . as a consequence",
    ", there is little difference in the ratios of cr , mn , or co to fe between subluminous sne and normal sne given the same progenitor mass .",
    "this turns out to be incompatible with spherically symmetric sne , as follows .",
    "the elements mn and cr are the products of incomplete si burning , whereas co is produced by complete si burning .",
    "fe is produced in both burning processes .",
    "the region of complete si burning is located at the bottom of the ejecta . if an sn explosion were spherically symmetric , different amounts of fe could only be attributable to different combinations of the mass cut separating the ejecta from the remnant and the explosion energy .",
    "since the mass cut determines the ejected fraction of the region in which complete si burning takes place , smaller co / fe ratios would be expected from sne with smaller amounts of fe , corresponding to subluminous sne .",
    "larger mn / fe and cr / fe ratios would be expected from these sne , as shown by @xcite . lower explosion energy would suppress complete si burning and thus reduce both the amount of fe and the co / fe ratio .",
    "therefore , any combination of explosion energy and mass cut in spherically symmetric sne is incompatible with the observed invariance of the abundance ratios of fe - group elements to fe .",
    "since rayleigh - taylor instabilities take place after the nuclear reactions freeze out as was shown by a multi - dimensional calculation @xcite , mixing does not alter the relative abundances of fe - group elements determined in the way mentioned above .",
    "the same calculation has also shown that the mixing process is effective .",
    "thus it is expected that fallback that may occur afterwards would hardly change these relative abundances , either .",
    "mixing is unlikely to explain the observed invariance of the relative abundances among sne with different explosion energies .    we will discuss a possibility that the observed ratios among fe - group elements for the two stars reflect those in the ism swept up by an snr rather than those in individual sn ejecta .",
    "indeed , the gas swept up by the snr from which stars are formed contains not only heavy elements ejected from the sn itself but also those already present in the ism . in general , for metal - poor regime such as [ mg / h ]",
    "2 , the stellar abundance pattern is essentially determined by the sn yield due to a negligible contribution from the ism ( st98 ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a lack of iron - group elements in the ejecta of a sub - luminous sn could enhance contribution from the ism to the stellar abundance of iron - group elements .",
    "since the [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , [ co / fe ] ratios in the ism should be equal to nearly zero , which corresponds to the plateau value seen in halo stars with 2@xmath26[fe / h]@xmath261 , the two stars discussed in this letter should show these abundance ratios nearly equal to the solar values if this is the case .",
    "however , the observed ratios shown in figure 3 do not support this possibility .",
    "therefore it is likely that these stars contain little heavy elements from the ism .",
    "furthermore , combinations of these ratios predicted from spherically symmetric sn models with those in the ism can not make the observed ones .",
    "stellar roation might be a factor to produce a variety in energies of supernova explosions with the same progenitor mass .",
    "it is sometimes suggested that a rapid rotaion leads to a jet - like explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , it has been a preferred explanation for matter mixing suggested by the emission line profiles observed for sn 1987a @xcite and sn 1998bw @xcite , both of which are core - collapse sne .",
    "furthermore , the optical spectropolarimetry of several core - collapse sne suggests highly asymmetric explosion mechanisms such as the formation of bipolar jets @xcite .",
    "detailed numerical studies on nucleosynthesis and ejection mechanism in jet - like explosions might be required to explain the observed trend of fe - group elements in halo field stars .",
    "an alternative solution may be in a hot bubble formed by neutrino emission .",
    "if neutrinos from the nascent neutron star deposit substantial energy to make a hot bubble behind the blast wave , the hot bubble may carry exclusively the product of complete si burning to the outer layer by buoyancy .",
    "a numerical simulation by @xcite has shown that this mechanism leads to a less energetic sn .",
    "this may suppress fallback of co and fe in subluminous sne , though other numerical studies have shown that a hot bubble does not result in a sn explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the current understanding of the involved physics is , however , still too premature to extract a definite conclusion on this issue .",
    "the recently discovered new class of carbon - rich stars including cs29498 - 043 and cs22949 - 037 , which exhibit a significant enhancement of @xmath0-elements with respect to fe - group elements , has been shown in this study to inherit the elemental abundance pattern of a precursor sne that ejected a small but adequate amount of fe with low explosion energy .",
    "these sne are found to resemble the two recently discovered subluminous sne 1997d and 1999br in terms of the ejected fe mass , explosion energy , and progenitor mass .",
    "subluminous supernovae may therefore be studied more easily by looking at the surface of nearby metal - poor stars than by searching for similar occurrences elsewhere .",
    "the present study revealed that there is little difference in the [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , [ co / fe ] ratios between subluminous sne and normal sne given the same progenitor mass , which has intriguing implications in nucleosynthesis and explosion in sn models .",
    "the observed facts are apparently at odds with the prediction by spherically symmetric sn explosion models .",
