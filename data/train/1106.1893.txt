    "over three dozen dark irregular satellites have been discovered around saturn using ground - based telescopes @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that these irregular satellites must have undergone intense collisional evolution that would have generated large quantities of dark dust over the age of the solar system@xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite estimate that on the order of @xmath2 kg of dust ( @xmath3 a thousandth the mass of the earth s moon ) has been generated in the outer saturnian system through collisional grinding of these satellites .",
    "furthermore , the recent discovery @xcite of a vast dust ring originating from the largest of the irregulars ( phoebe ) shows that these dust - producing collisional processes are ongoing even today .",
    "small dust particles are strongly affected by radiation forces @xcite ; in particular , poynting - robertson drag will cause particles to lose energy and slowly migrate toward their parent planet .",
    "one should therefore expect mass transfer from the dark outer irregular satellites to the generally brighter inner regular satellites ( see fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "iapetus is the outermost of the regular satellites and , importantly , is observed to be tidally locked @xcite . as such",
    ", one hemisphere permanently faces the direction of motion and would plow through the cloud of dark dust as the cloud evolves inward .",
    "since phoebe ( and most of the other irregulars ) orbits retrograde and would generate dust particles on retrograde paths , collisions with the prograde iapetus would occur at high relative velocities ( @xmath4 km / s ) and the dust would mostly coat iapetus only on its leading side . this model for the exogenous origin of the dark material on iapetus",
    "was first proposed by @xcite and seems plausible ; when one looks at the observed albedo map of iapetus , one finds that the dark region , cassini regio , is centered precisely around the apex of motion  a difficult fact to explain for endogenous mechanisms @xcite .    as @xcite point out , however , the extremely sharp boundaries between bright and dark material can not be the result of simple dust deposition , which would yield more gradual transitions . to explain the striking boundaries , as well as the bright poles , @xcite propose a model of runaway ice sublimation in which areas initially darkened by dust become completely blackened .",
    "the sublimed ice then settles on the poles and on the brighter ( and therefore colder ) trailing side .",
    "these two processes together , exogenous dust deposition coupled with thermal ice migration , seem the most promising mechanism to forming iapetus striking global albedo dichotomy .",
    "this schematic diagram depicts the expected extent of the phoebe ring ( solid gray ) , as well as the orbits of both phoebe ( black ) and the rest of the irregular satellites ( light gray ) .",
    "the circle at the center represents the main rings , with the e ring surrounding them .",
    "approximate scale is provided in saturn radii ( rs ) . according to the model of @xcite , as the ring of retrograde dust drifts inward from phoebe s semimajor axis ( arrows ) ,",
    "iapetus leading side sweeps up this material , darkening its leading side .",
    "figure provided by matthew s. tiscareno.,width=340 ]    the recently discovered `` phoebe ring '' @xcite represents a snapshot in time of the inexorable process of mass transfer from the dark outer irregulars onto the inner icy satellites .",
    "the ring thickness implicates phoebe as the source , showing that soter s mechanism of coating iapetus is ongoing",
    ". we will show below that almost all particles in the phoebe ring of size @xmath5 m will strike iapetus ; however , particles smaller than @xmath6 m will strike saturn , its main rings , or escape the system within a half - saturn orbit(@xmath7 yrs ) due to radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "our presentation improves on two previously published works .",
    "@xcite published a short analysis of the dynamics of dust particles from phoebe and @xcite included in their paper a simplified analysis that included poynting - robertson drag but neglected the important effects of the dominant component of solar radiation pressure ( radial from the sun ) , which affects particles eccentricities and can quickly drive small grains out of the system .",
    "this paper performs a more in - depth analysis , considering all the important radiation and tidal perturbations from the sun and calculating the expected coverage on the iapetus surface .",
    "we also include the precession of iapetus orbital axis , which extends coverage over the poles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.2 discusses the determination of probabilities for dust striking iapetus from numerically integrated dust orbits . in sec.3",
    "we present calculated distributions of dust on the iapetus surface , comparing them to the observed distribution and using them to obtain estimates for polar deposition rates .",
    "sec.4 addresses the same process for the dozens of irregular satellites other than phoebe , and sec.5 tracks the fate of dust grains that do not strike iapetus and that instead collide with hyperion and titan .",
    "in order to estimate dust particles likelihoods of striking iapetus , we first consider the important effects of the perturbations affecting dust particle dynamics .",
    "most dust particles spend their lifetimes in a radial range ( between the orbits of phoebe and iapetus ) where the dominant perturbations are solar . the important modifications to these particle orbits",
    "therefore result from radiation pressure and solar gravity .",
    "nevertheless , since small particles eccentricities can bring them closer to saturn , we also included the perturbation from saturn s second - order zonal harmonic in our numerical integrations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , particles smaller than @xmath6 m are so affected by solar radiation pressure that they are quickly removed from the system ; in this size regime , electromagnetic forces from the planet s magnetosphere are negligible relative to the other perturbations @xcite .",
    "note that the smallest particles might not be blown out by radiation pressure ; once the particle size becomes small relative to the incident light s wavelength , the dust particles will no longer be able to effectively couple to the radiation field .",

    "eventually , dust - particle orbits will cross that of iapetus as poynting - robertson drag reduces the orbit size and radiation pressure periodically induces large eccentricities . over time , therefore , the dark particles will impact iapetus leading side .    as opposed to gravitational accelerations , accelerations due to",

    "we determine that for our assumed density , particles smaller than 4 @xmath1 m are so affected by radiation pressure that within the first half - saturn year their eccentricities reach a value of unity and the grains either collide with saturn or its rings , or escape the saturn system entirely .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath35 particle orbits and a negligible probability of collision with iapetus .",
    "one should therefore expect only a significant contribution to iapetus from particles @xmath0 4 @xmath1 m in size . since dust particles are not actually spherical and will contain some void space , our assumed density is probably high and our 4 @xmath1 m likely represents a lower limit .    on the other extreme ,",
    "the orbital eccentricities of particles larger than 500 @xmath1 m ( poynting - robertson decay timescale @xmath0 50 million years ) are almost completely unaffected by radiation forces and are dominantly affected by the sun s tidal gravitational force , which is independent of particle size .",

    "therefore , since phoebe s escape velocity is much smaller than its orbital velocity ( @xmath3 0.1 km / s vs. @xmath3 1.7 km / s ) , we expect most dust particles generated in an impact with phoebe to approximately share that moon s orbital elements .",

    "since the dust particles orbital periods around saturn are much shorter than this ( @xmath50 1.5 years ) , the exact position of phoebe ( _ f _ ) in its orbit at the time of impact does little to influence the subsequent evolution of the orbit s shape or orientation ; thus it can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "phoebe s orbit orientation at the time of impact , however , _ is _ important because it precesses more slowly .",
    "nevertheless , one can still limit the phase space by inspecting the geometry .",
    "since the dominant perturbations in this problem are all of solar origin , the logical plane from which to reference inclinations is saturn s orbital plane ( i.e. , the plane in which the sun appears to move in a saturnocentric frame ) .",
    "phoebe s inclination relative to saturn s orbital plane of @xmath51 means its own orbital plane is almost coplanar , albeit in a retrograde sense , with this reference plane .    in the limit of coplanarity ,",
    "only one angle ( rather than both _",
    "@xmath46 _ and _ @xmath47 _ ) is required to specify the orientation of the orbit given the inclination , i.e. , the angle between an arbitrary reference direction and the orbit s pericenter . in this case",
    ", the physically meaningful reference direction is the one toward the source of perturbations , the sun .",
    "the orbital evolution of the dust particle therefore does not depend strongly on _",

    "note that for a prograde orbit , the angle from the sun s direction to pericenter would be _ @xmath52 _ , but since _ @xmath47 _ is measured in the direction of orbital motion , the appropriate combination for _ retrograde _ orbits is _ @xmath46 _ - _",
    "@xmath47_.    the approximations discussed above transform an intractable multidimensional space of initial conditions into a simple one - dimensional space .",
    "the elements _ a _ , _ e _ , and _",
    "i _ are those of phoebe s orbit , and the only other initial condition left to supply is the quantity @xmath53 , with @xmath54 measured relative to the sun s direction at the time of impact .",
    "since impacts could happen at any point in the precession cycle , we chose to perform integrations for eight equally - spaced values of @xmath53 .",
    "we therefore generate , for each particle size , eight sets of _",

    "are taken as known while the precession angles that determine the orientation of the orbits ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) are treated as uniformly distributed . barring resonances between the orbital periods of the dust particles with iapetus",
    ", this should be a good assumption over collision timescales ( @xmath55 years ) , which are long compared to the longest precession timescale ( iapetus orbit pole , @xmath56 years ) .",
    "this assumption was found to agree with the angular distributions from the numerical integrations .",
    "an alternative strategy could have been to numerically integrate many dust particle orbits and to directly see when and where on iapetus they strike .",
    "one drawback of such a method is that iapetus small size relative to the dust orbits would dictate using extremely small step sizes in the integration .",
    "our approach allowed us to perform fewer computationally expensive orbit integrations per particle size in exchange for computationally cheaper collision probability integrals .",
    "the calculations of @xcite are too complicated to reproduce here .",
    "the calculation is performed by first calculating the values of @xmath57 that would lead to the two orbits crossing ( ` p ' subscripts refer to the particle and ` i ' subscripts to iapetus ) .",
    "then the objects finite size is taken into account by taylor - expanding around these crossing solutions to find the volume in @xmath57 space over which collisions are possible .",
    "finally one calculates from keplerian theory the probability that both objects will simultaneously be close enough to the point of closest approach for a collision to occur within one object s orbit .",
    "the ratio of this probability to the orbital period provides a collision frequency . we compared our code to the test cases presented in @xcite and found it reproduced their results .    due to the wide disparity between orbital period ( @xmath3 1 year ) and the collision timescale ( @xmath58 years ) , it is impractical to calculate collision probabilities for every orbit .",
    "one can see in fig .",

    "iapetus inclination with respect to saturn s orbital plane , however , changes significantly over time and must be considered more carefully .",
    "to first approximation , the orbit normal precesses uniformly and at a constant inclination to a vector determined by the perturbations causing the precession .",
    "this causes the orbit normal to sweep out a cone ( see fig.[laplace ] ) .",
    "the vector around which orbits precess defines the local laplace plane ( normal to this vector ) . at phoebe",
    "s orbit , all the dominant perturbations are solar , so the local laplace plane corresponds to the plane in which the sun appears to move , saturn s orbital plane .",
    "close to saturn , where the dominant perturbation is saturn s oblateness , the local laplace plane is saturn s equatorial plane .",
    "iapetus has the unique orbital property among satellites of existing at a distance where saturnian and solar perturbations are comparable , and the local laplace plane is intermediate , at about @xmath71 to saturn s orbital plane ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a schematic representation of the changing orientations of iapetus and phoebe s orbits ( represented by their respective orbit normals pon @xmath70 phoebe orbit normal and ion @xmath70 iapetus orbit normal ) .",
    "the moons orbit normals precess at constant inclinations ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 for phoebe and iapetus , respectively ) to the normal vector to their local laplace planes , sweeping out a cone .",
    "phoebe s laplace plane coincides with saturn s orbit normal , while iapetus local laplace plane normal ( ilpn ) is inclined about @xmath74 to saturn s orbit normal.,width=340 ]    because of this misalignment , although iapetus will precess at approximately constant inclination to the normal to its local laplace plane , its inclination relative to our reference plane ( saturn s orbital plane ) will change as the orbit precesses ( see fig .",
    "[ laplace ] ) .",
    "we therefore assumed uniform precession and coarsely averaged the probability calculation over an entire precessional cycle , sampling more finely when the inclinations of the particle and iapetus were antiparallel and the collision probability was changing fastest .    finally , as mentioned in sec.2.1 , we averaged over the eight equally probable initial conditions that we integrated , yielding an overall cumulative probability of collision for the given particle size .",
    "apart from iapetus , we also tracked collisions with hyperion and titan , as well as re - impacts into phoebe .",
    "we therefore straightforwardly generalized the discussion above to not only update the cumulative probability of collision with iapetus at each timestep , but also those with the other three moons . as is discussed below",
    ", titan s large size renders it a sink for any long - lived dust particles that cross its path ; thus , no other moons interior to it would receive appreciable amounts of dust and such bodies are therefore not tracked . as mentioned earlier , however , a significant fraction of the particles smaller than @xmath3 5 @xmath1 m whose eccentricities all reach unity will strike saturn or its rings within the first half saturn - year .",

    "particles @xmath5 m almost all strike iapetus , though larger particles take a longer time to do so.,width=340 ]    particles 10 @xmath1 m and larger , being less affected by radiation forces , evolve inward via poynting - robertson drag so slowly ( i.e. , they execute many iapetus - crossing orbits before crossing the orbits of hyperion or titan ) that they almost all eventually strike iapetus . as stated before , particles smaller than about 4 @xmath1 m quickly strike saturn or escape the saturn system . therefore , of the longer - lived particles , _ almost all _ particle sizes are bound for iapetus  only a very narrow size range ( between about 4 and 10 @xmath1 m for the chosen density ) can miss and end up mostly on titan , with a substantially smaller fraction striking hyperion .",
    "we mention that , while almost all particles larger than @xmath3 10 @xmath1 m would eventually strike iapetus , it takes larger particles longer to evolve inward and hit the satellite .",
    "in particular , for particles in the geometrical optics limit ( the peak wavelength in the solar spectrum @xmath75 m @xmath76 , satisfied for all particle sizes we consider ) , the poynting - robertson decay timescale grows linearly with particle size ( see * ? ? ? * ) . as a reference , assuming particles share phoebe s density of 1.6 g/@xmath34 , 10 @xmath1 m particles reach iapetus in @xmath41 myr .",
    "as particle sizes increase , one should expect to find a threshold where particles stop hitting iapetus when the poynting - robertson decay timescale becomes longer than the timescale for the destruction of dust grains .",
    "unfortunately , destruction lifetimes for dust in the outer saturn system are not well constrained ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "one mechanism for the destruction of dust grains is through mutual collisions .",
    "one can estimate the mean free time between particle collisions as @xmath77 where p is the particles orbital period and @xmath78 the ring s normal optical depth . taking the optical depth in the phoebe ring , @xmath79 @xcite , this yields @xmath80 myr , the poynting - robertson decay timescale corresponding to 1 mm grains ; however , for each particle size , only collisions with particles of roughly the same size or larger affect the dynamics .",
    "this would act to increase @xmath81 , but is dependent on the ( currently unconstrained ) particle size distribution . on the other hand , dust rings collisionally generated early in the solar system likely had higher optical depths @xcite , lowering @xmath81 .",
    "for this work we chose the maximum upper - size cutoff imposed by setting the poynting - robertson decay timescale equal to the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "this yields a particle size of @xmath82 cm .",
    "improved estimates of collisional dust lifetimes in the phoebe ring must await further observations .",
    "as the introduction mentions , a large supply of dust has been available in the outer saturn system over the course of the solar system s history . the fact that particles @xmath0 10 @xmath1 m are virtually certain to strike iapetus strongly implicates collisionally generated dust as the trigger to iapetus stark albedo dichotomy .",
    "an exogenous origin of the dark material explains why the pattern is centered on the apex of iapetus motion and , as shall be shown in sec . 3",
    ", the dynamics predict a wrapping of dark material onto the trailing side consistent with that observed .",
    "we now explain the sharp drop in the final fraction of particles that strike iapetus between 5 and 10 @xmath1 m , as seen in fig .",
    "[ probabilities ] .",
    "this is due to the large eccentricities induced by radiation pressure , visible in fig .",
    "[ integration ] . for the smallest particles ,",
    "the eccentricities are high enough that before the dust grains probabilities of striking iapetus near certainty , their orbits begin to cross that of titan .",
    "saturn s largest moon is such a better interceptor of particles that the probability of striking iapetus quickly stops increasing and levels off .",
    "there are several reasons why titan is highly efficient at eliminating dust particles .",
    "most obviously , its sheer size makes its geometrical cross section larger than iapetus by a factor of about 12 .",
    "another reason is that collision rates depend on the objects relative velocity , as this determines how frequently the objects can potentially encounter each other ( see discussion following eq .",
    "[ tcol ] ) .",
    "relative velocities between dust particles and titan are substantially higher than those with iapetus simply because in order to reach the further - in titan , particles generally have to be on very eccentric orbits ( _ e _ = 0.7 - 0.9 ) , and will encounter titan close to periapse .    one might have expected slow relative velocities to lead to enhanced collision probabilities due to strong gravitational focusing for slow encounters .",
    "in fact , gravitational focusing plays little role in this problem because the moon orbits are prograde while the dust orbits are retrograde , resulting in high relative velocities compared to the satellites escape velocities ( @xmath83 km / s for iapetus , @xmath84 km / s for titan ) . for typical encounter velocities ,",
    "iapetus gravitational cross - section is about 0.5% greater than its geometrical cross - section ( @xmath85 for titan ) .",
    "though we account for gravitational enhancements to the collision cross section , in our orbit integrations we ignore close encounters with titan ( and all other satellites ) on subsequent orbital paths . for typical relative velocities ,",
    "the maximum scattering angle from a close encounter is @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding angle for iapetus is @xmath87 .",
    "we postpone our discussion of the total amount of material that strikes titan and the smaller hyperion , along with its implications , until sec .",
    "since much of the dust previously orbiting in the outer saturnian system will eventually strike iapetus , we ask where on iapetus those particles would have landed .",
    "in particular , can the dynamics match the extent of iapetus dark side , cassini regio ?",
    "the emplacement of dust could then trigger the thermal migration of ice thought to give iapetus the striking appearance it has today @xcite .",
    "cassini regio extends beyond iapetus leading side by tens of degrees onto the trailing side along the equator ( see fig .",
    "[ iapetusmap ] ) .",
    "as @xcite have suggested , dust eccentricities naturally explain the longitudinal extension of the dark material onto the trailing side .",
    "if orbits were perfectly circular , dust particles would only strike iapetus head - on , as both objects would be moving perfectly azimuthally in opposite directions ; thus , only the leading face would be darkened since , as discussed at the end of sec .",
    "2.4 , the encounter velocities make gravitational focusing negligible .    when particles have eccentric orbits , however , particle velocities are no longer perfectly azimuthal , and the radial components allow particles to strike the moon further along the equator ( see fig . [ extensiondiagram ] ) .",
    "eccentricities induced by radiation pressure therefore provide a natural mechanism for extending dust coverage onto the trailing side .     global mosaic of iapetus ( from * ? ? ?",
    "dark cassini regio is centered around the apex of iapetus motion , roughly at @xmath88w , and extends tens of degrees beyond @xmath89 and @xmath90w onto the trailing side .",

    "2.2 ) translates into a uniformly distributed bundle of quasi - parallel trajectories capable of striking iapetus .",
    "in such a uniform field , the probability of an impact in a given area element simply is proportional to its projected area , given by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the angle between iapetus velocity vector and the outward normal vector to the area element .",

    "<S> the leading face of saturn s moon iapetus , cassini regio , has an albedo only one tenth that on its trailing side . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this enigmatic dichotomy has been debated for over forty years , but with new data , a clearer picture is emerging . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by cassini radar and imaging observations , we investigate soter s model of dark exogenous dust striking an originally brighter iapetus by modeling the dynamics of the dark dust from the ring of the exterior retrograde satellite phoebe under the relevant perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the particles probabilities of striking iapetus , as well as their expected spatial distribution on the iapetian surface . we find that , of the long - lived particles ( @xmath0 5 @xmath1 m ) , most particle sizes ( @xmath0 10 @xmath1 m ) are virtually certain to strike iapetus , and their calculated distribution on the surface matches up well with cassini regio s extent in its longitudinal span . </S>",
    "<S> the satellite s polar regions are observed to be bright , presumably because ice is deposited there . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the latitudinal direction we estimate polar dust deposition rates to help constrain models of thermal migration invoked to explain the bright poles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze dust originating from other irregular outer moons , determining that a significant fraction of that material will eventually coat iapetus  perhaps explaining why the spectrum of iapetus dark material differs somewhat from that of phoebe . </S>",
    "<S> finally we track the dust particles that do not strike iapetus , and find that most land on titan , with a smaller fraction hitting hyperion . </S>",
    "<S> as has been previously conjectured , such exogenous dust , coupled with hyperion s chaotic rotation , could produce hyperion s roughly isotropic , moderate - albedo surface .    </S>",
