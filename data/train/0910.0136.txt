    "it is well known that glasses at low temperatures ( below 1 k ) display a number of universal properties which are drastically different from the properties of similar crystals .",
    "these properties are almost independent of the chemical composition of a glass and mainly due to the disordered atomic structure of an amorphous solid ; more exactly , due to the absence of a long - range order in the glass @xcite .    according to the standard theory of anderson , halperin , varma , and phillips @xcite ,",
    "all these universal properties are associated with the existence of two - level systems ( tls s ) in glasses .",
    "tls consist of atoms or groups of atoms that may tunnel between two minima in a double - well potential .",
    "however , the microscopic nature of the tls s in the majority of glasses remains unknown .",
    "one of such universal phenomena is an electric - dipole echo @xcite .",
    "depending on the sequence of applied high frequency electric pulses one usually discriminates between two - pulse and three - pulse echo .",
    "the essence of the two - pulse echo is the following .",
    "when a glass is subjected to two short electromagnetic pulses at a frequency of about 1 ghz separated by a time interval @xmath1 , a response signal at the same frequency may be detected in the dipole moment of the system at time @xmath1 after the second pulse . in the three - pulse echo",
    "we have a sequence of three pumping electromagnetic pulses in the moments @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 correspondingly .",
    "a coherent echo signal in this case appears at the time @xmath4 .",
    "a very interesting echo phenomenon was discovered recently in 2002 @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the two - pulse dipole echo in some nonmagnetic glasses exhibited a strong non - monotonic ( oscillating ) dependence on the magnetic field even in weak fields ( about 10 mt ) .",
    "wurger , fleischmann , and enss @xcite suggested that this unusual magnetic field effect is caused by the presence of non - spherical tunneling nuclei with the electric quadrupole moment ( or , equivalently , the nuclear spin @xmath5 ) in the glass .",
    "the interaction of the quadrupole moment with gradient of static microscopic electric field in two wells of double - well potential creates a fine splitting of energy levels in tls transforming the tls to multi - level system .",
    "this idea agrees very well with the experimental data , in particular , with the results of the recent measurements of the two - pulse dipole echo in glycerol ( c@xmath6h@xmath7o@xmath6 ) @xcite . in these experiments",
    ", it was shown that the replacement of hydrogen , which has nuclear spin @xmath8 and , consequently , a zero quadrupole moment , by deuterium ( @xmath9 and a nonzero quadrupole moment ) results in a more than an order of magnitude enhancement of the magnetic - field dependence of the echo .",
    "the magnetic - field dependence of the two - pulse echo amplitude in glasses with nuclear quadrupole moments was theoretically studied by wurger , fleischmann , and enss @xcite and by one of us @xcite .",
    "however the weak magnetic field non monotonic dependence of echo in non - deuterated glycerol could not be explained in such a way .",
    "neither of nuclei forming glycerol glass c@xmath6h@xmath7o@xmath6 possess a nuclear quadrupole moment .",
    "to explain this interesting phenomenon in non - deuterated glycerol bazrafshan et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the magnetic field dependence of the two - pulse echo amplitude in this case may be caused by the dipole - dipole interaction of the nuclear magnetic moments of hydrogen atoms . this interaction ( along with zeeman interaction )",
    "can also create a fine structure of two levels in tls , which depends on the applied magnetic field .    in the papers @xcite the two - pulse echo amplitude",
    "was numerically calculated in deuterated glycerol c@xmath6d@xmath10h@xmath6o@xmath6 ( taking into account all of the spins of hydrogen and the quadrupole moments of deuterium nuclei ) , assuming that the tunneling motion in the two level system is the rotation of the glycerol molecule as a whole .",
    "results of these calculations were in a good agreement with experimental data . later in @xcite",
    "an analytical theory of the magnetic field dependence of the two - pulse echo amplitude in glasses with dipole - dipole interaction of nuclear spins was developed . without any assumptions about microscopic tunneling mechanism of hydrogen atoms in glycerol and without fitting parameters it also shows a very good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to build a theory of the three - pulse echo in glasses in a magnetic field to stimulate further experimental investigations of this interesting phenomenon .",
