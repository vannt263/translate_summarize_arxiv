    "m32 is a galaxy with very unusual characteristics . compared to dwarf galaxies having similar absolute brightness ( @xmath2 )",
    "its central surface brightness ( @xmath3 ) is 4 orders of magnitudes higher and its core radius ( @xmath4 ) 3 orders of magnitude smaller @xcite . within the two planes ` @xmath5 ' and ` @xmath6 ' , m32 lies approximately on the extension of the sequence defined by elliptical galaxies and is clearly distinct from the low surface brightness dwarf galaxies following a different sequence ( cf . with fig.[sbm ] ) .",
    "therefore , m32 is often denoted as a dwarf elliptical galaxy and the other dwarf galaxies as dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) @xcite , whereas other authors use the term compact elliptical for m32 and dwarf elliptical for the low surface brightness objects only @xcite ) .",
    "so far , only very few other galaxies with properties similar to m32 have been found @xcite . but none of these galaxies has such extreme properties as m32 .",
    "ferguson & sandage @xcite classified a number of galaxies in nearby groups as possible m32-type objects due to their compact appearance on photographic plates ( similar to ngc 4486b in sandage & binggeli @xcite though ngc4486b is still 2 mag  brighter than m32 ) .",
    "we obtained spectroscopy of these candidate galaxies in the leo group during a longer observing run within our project to study the evolution of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the galaxies were drawn from tableii of ferguson & sandage @xcite and are designated in the following as leo # , where # corresponds to the number assigned in that table .    in the following sections we briefly describe the observations and their analysis ,",
    "present the results and draw our conclusions .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made at the 3.5 m telescope on calar alto using the boller&chivens twin spectrograph . the spectra cover the wavelength range @xmath7  and have an instrumental resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "the exposure time was 1h .",
    "the ccd images were reduced in the usual way and the spectra were extracted and integrated with an algorithm introduced by horne @xcite .",
    "absorption line indices of h@xmath9 , mg@xmath10 , mg@xmath11 , fe5(@xmath12 ) and fe6  ( @xmath13 ) were measured in the one - dimensional spectra following faber et al .",
    "they were corrected for velocity dispersion broadening and normalized to the lick system by means of observed reference stars .",
    "velocity dispersions were derived using the fcq - method by bender @xcite .",

    "all measured quantities lie within the parameter range typical for normal elliptical galaxies . in particular , the leo galaxies obey the well - known faber - jackson ( @xmath29 ) , fundamental plane and mg@xmath30 relation of elliptical galaxies . as an example , we show the location of the leo galaxies in the surface brightness - absolute magnitude diagram in fig.[sbm ] in comparison to the compilation of dynamically hot galaxies given by bender et al .",

    "the mean effective surface brightness within @xmath20 was computed according to @xmath31 with @xmath24 being the total apparent @xmath24 magnitude .",
    "it is evident that the leo galaxies are not similar to m32 , but are giant or intermediate ellipticals in the nomenclature of bbf .",
    "leo12 could also well be classified as a bright dwarf elliptical .",
    "leo38 has a much too low surface brightness to be an m32 analogue and , so , even without a spectrum we can safely conclude that it is either a high luminosity giant elliptical at @xmath32 or a dwarf spheroidal at @xmath33 .    in fig.[ind ] , we compare the absorption indices of the leo galaxies to the sample of elliptical galaxies given by gonzlez @xcite . most of the measured values agree well with the gonzlez sample for the same velocity dispersion .",
    "the velocity dispersion of leo12 is so low that our instrumental resolution is insufficient to give an accurate value .",
    "its small absorption indices indicate also the presence of a substantial stellar disk component that fills h@xmath9  with emission and produces an [ oiii ] emission line .",
    "therefore , leo12 might even be a spiral galaxy seen face - on .",
    "the mg@xmath11  absorption of leo44 is extraordinarily low which indicates low age and may be due to a disk component .",
    "this is supported by the h@xmath34absorption that is just redshifted enough to be visible at the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "both , the spectroscopic and the photometric parameters of the observed leo galaxies demonstrate that they are not m32-analogues .",
    "m32 is still a quite unique object with only very few other galaxies having similar properties and constituting the family of compact ellipticals , however none of these is as faint as m32 .",
    "if this family is taken as the natural extension of all elliptical galaxies to lower luminosities the absence of m32-type objects in leo adds further evidence that the faint end of the luminosity function of elliptical galaxies falls off very steeply at absolute blue magnitudes fainter than 17 @xcite .",
    "our results also show that in general only spectroscopy can prove whether a galaxy is of the type of m32 ."
