    "a major approximate tool in the equilibrium statistical physics of lattice models is the mean  field theory , together with its many generalizations .",
    "these techniques are known to give quite often reliable qualitative results , which makes them very useful in understanding properties of a model like its phase diagram . due to the limited quantitative accuracy of simple mean",
    " field theory , many generalizations were developed .",
    "since mean  field neglects correlations , typically the idea is to include local , but progressively longer range correlations in the treatment , for example by means of cluster expansions where clusters of increasing size can be included .",
    "this line of research started with the bethe ",
    "peierls approximation @xcite , where nearest  neighbour correlations are taken into account , and the kramers  wannier approximation @xcite , including correlations up to a square plaquette .",
    "many generalizations were then proposed , and a particularly successful one was the cluster variational method ( cvm ) , introduced by kikuchi in 1951 @xcite and applied to the ising model .",
    "the largest clusters considered by kikuchi in this work were a cube of 8 sites for the simple cubic lattice and a tetrahedron of 4 sites for the face centered cubic lattice .",
    "larger clusters were later considered : in 1967 kikuchi and brush @xcite introduced the @xmath0 sequence of approximations for the two  dimensional square lattice , whose convergence properties were later studied @xcite using maximal clusters up to 13 sites . kikuchi and",
    "brush also suggested that a similar approach could in principle be carried out in three dimensions , although the computational costs would have been prohibitively large at that time .",
    "their intuition was put on a firmer ground by schlijper @xcite , who showed that , for translation  invariant models in the thermodynamical limit , there exist sequences of cvm approximations whose free energy converges to the exact one .",
    "for a @xmath1dimensional model , the largest clusters to consider grow in @xmath2 dimensions only , as in a transfer matrix approach . in 3 dimensions",
    "this idea was used by the present author to develop a cvm approximation for the ising model on the simple cubic lattice based on an 18site ( @xmath3 ) cluster @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty encountered in trying to enlarge the basic clusters is the computational cost , which grows exponentially with the cluster size .",
    "more precisely the problem can be written as the minimization of a free energy whose number of indipendent variables increases exponentially with the cluster size .",
    "a significant amount of work was then devoted to develop efficient algorithms .",
    "the original iterative algorithm proposed by kikuchi @xcite , the so  called natural iteration method , is not particularly efficient , but in certain cases it is provably convergent @xcite to a ( maybe local ) minimum of the free energy .",
    "faster , provably convergent algorithms were developed more recently @xcite .",
    "a very important step in the direction of speeding up algorithms for the minimization of the cvm free energy has been made in 2001 , when it was shown @xcite that belief propagation ( bp ) @xcite , a message  passing algorithm widely used for approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models , is strictly related to the bethe  peierls approximation . in particular , it was shown @xcite that fixed points of the bp algorithms correspond to stationary points of the bethe ",
    "peierls variational free energy .",
    "this result was later extended by showing that stable fixed points of bp are ( possibly local ) minima of the bethe ",
    "peierls variational free energy , though the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "this provides us with the fastest , but not always convergent , algorithm for the minimization of the bethe  peierls free energy . when convergent , bp outperforms the other algorithms by orders of magnitude ( see @xcite for a detailed comparison ) .",
    "bp was also extended to an algorithm , named generalized belief propagation ( gbp ) @xcite , whose fixed points are stationary points of the cvm free energy for any choice of basic clusters .",
    "like bp , gbp is extremely fast but not always convergent .",
    "the purpose of the work described here is twofold : we aim both to test how gbp performs in minimizing a cvm free energy with a very large ( 32 sites ) basic cluster , and to make one more step in the hierarchy of cvm approximations for three  dimensional lattice models .",
    "working on the ising model on the simple cubic lattice as a paradigmatic example , we follow schlijper s ideas and enlarge the basic cluster for our cvm approximation in 2 dimensions only , thus choosing a @xmath4 cluster ( as far as we know , the largest cluster ever considered in cvm ) .",
    "we then use a gbp algorithm to minimize the corresponding free energy in a wide range of temperatures and discuss the accuracy of the result , focussing in particular on the spontaneous magnetization , in comparison with state  of  the  art results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : meth ] we describe our cvm approximation and the gbp algorithm we use to minimize it , in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] we analyze the performance of the algorithm and the accuracy of the results for the magnetization , and conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "the cvm is based on the minimization of an approximate variational free energy , which is obtained from a truncation of a cumulant expansion of the entropy @xcite .",
    "a particular cvm approximation is specified by the set @xmath5 of clusters one wants to keep in the expansion : the typical choice involves a set of maximal clusters and all their subclusters . introducing the mbius numbers",

    "we shall consider the nearest ",
    "neighbour ising model in zero field , so our hamiltonian will be @xmath18 ( the coupling constant @xmath19 has also been set to 1 , hence the temperature will be expressed in units of @xmath20 ) .",
    "the splitting of @xmath16 into contributions @xmath13 from the various clusters appearing in the expansion is not unique , several ( equivalent ) choices are possible . in the following we distribute @xmath16 evenly among the maximal clusters only , so that no hamiltonian terms appear in the subcluster free energies .",
    "our choice for the largest clusters in @xmath5 is based on schlijper s result @xcite that for a @xmath1dimensional model one can improve accuracy by increasing the maximal clusters in @xmath2 dimensions only . on the simple cubic lattice ,",
    "the elementary cubic cell of @xmath21 sites has been already considered by kikuchi @xcite and a @xmath22 basic cluster made of 4 elementary cubic cells has been used in @xcite .",
    "the next step in this sequence is then a @xmath23 basic cluster ( 32 sites , 9 elementary cubic cells ) . as far as we know , this is the largest maximal cluster ever used in a cvm approximation .",
    "the number of possible ising configurations of such a cluster is @xmath24 , which is also the number of independent variables in our variational problem .",
    "more precisely , exploiting lattice symmetries , this number can be reduced by a factor close to 16 , leaving us with @xmath25 independent variables . in order to deal with such a large number of variables",
    ", we shall use the parent  to  child gbp algorithm @xcite to find stationary points of the variational free energy .",
    "this will also provide a test of convergence and performance of the algorithm in a very large scale problem .",
    "the parent  to  child gbp algorithm is a message  passing algorithm , based on iterative equations written in terms of quantities called messages , which are exchanged between clusters .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath26 for a message going from cluster @xmath10 to cluster @xmath27 , which is a function of the configuration @xmath28 of the latter .",
    "only clusters @xmath29 with mbius number @xmath30 are involved in the message  passing scheme . exploiting the lattice translational invariance in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we shall identify a cluster by the symbol @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the lengths of the cluster in the three spatial directions , in terms of lattice sites .",
    "for instance , a cluster made of a single site will be denoted by 111 , nearest ",
    "neighbour pairs in the three directions by 211 , 121 and 112 respectively , the elementary cubic cell by 222 , and our maximal cluster by 442 . with this notation , it is easy to check that , according to eq .",
    "[ mobiusnumbers ] , if @xmath5 includes 442 and all its subclusters , the only clusters with non  vanishing mbius numbers are the following : @xmath35 thanks to lattice isotropy , when @xmath36 , the clusters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are equivalent , so we need to consider only six different clusters , that is six probability distributions , related to each other by marginalization conditions . in the parent",
    " to  child gbp algorithm @xcite , messages go from a ( parent ) cluster @xmath10 to a _ direct _",
    "subcluster ( child ) @xmath39 , where direct means that there exist no other cluster @xmath40 with @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "hence , in the present cvm approximation , we will have to introduce only the messages corresponding to the parent  child pairs listed in tab.[parentchildren ] .",

    "here we found that convergence was always achieved by replacing , after each iteration , the new messages with the geometric mean of old and new messages .",
    "the parent  to  child gbp algorithm described in the previous section was applied to the simple cubic ising model in the low  temperature phase .",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath67 was varied in the range 0.223 to 0.436 , with a step @xmath68 .",

    "it is necessary to resort to an instance of the gbp algorithm for the minimization of the variational free energy . as a consequence",
    ", this work also tests the gbp algorithm with a very large maximal cluster , showing that convergence can be achieved in reasonable times even with @xmath138 messages .",
    "the accuracy of the results is assessed by evaluating the spontaneous magnetization and comparing it with previous approximations and with a recent best estimate .",
    "in addition to the expected improvement with respect to @xmath136 and 3 , we observe that the availability of results for three @xmath98 values allows an extrapolation , with the only assumption that the approach to the exact value is exponential in @xmath98 .",
    "this assumption is much weaker than those underlying other techniques used to attempt to extrapolate non  classical critical behaviour from generalized mean field theories , like the cluster variational ",
    "pad approximant method @xcite or the coherent anomaly method @xcite .",
    "it does not seem feasible , at least at the moment , to investigate the next approximation in the sequence , corresponding to @xmath139 .",
    "this would mean to use a 50site maximal cluster , making the number of variables increase by a factor @xmath140 with respect to the present study .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that while the above analysis was carried out by considering the zero  field magnetization , thus leading to an estimate for the critical exponent @xmath27 , it could be extended to several other quantities .",
    "the magnetization itself could be computed in the presence of an external field , yielding estimates for the critical isotherm and its exponent @xmath141 . moreover , any correlation function involving a group of sites contained in our largest cluster can be computed , in particular short  range correlation functions , and hence the internal energy , even in the above  mentioned improved ising models with third  neighbour interactions . from the magnetization in non ",
    "zero field and the internal energy , taking numerical derivatives , response functions like specific heat and susceptibilities can be obtained , and the respective exponents @xmath10 and @xmath40 could be estimated .",
