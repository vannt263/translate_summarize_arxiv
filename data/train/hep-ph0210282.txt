    "the @xmath0 decay has attracted much theoretical attention , since chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) calculations have sizable uncertainties and produce systematically rates about a factor of two smaller than experiment @xcite .",
    "in contrast models using quark box diagrams @xcite claim to obtain acceptable rates . within chpt ,",
    "the problem stems from the fact that the tree level amplitudes , both at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , vanish .",
    "the first non - vanishing contribution comes at @xmath5 , but either from loops involving kaons , largely suppressed due to the kaon masses , or from pion loops , again suppressed since they violate g parity and are thus proportional to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the first sizable contribution comes at @xmath7 but the coefficients involved are not precisely determined .",
    "one must recur to models : either vector meson dominance ( vmd ) @xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl ) @xcite , or the extended nambu - jona - lasinio model ( enjl ) @xcite , have been used to determine these parameters",
    ". however , the use of tree level vmd to obtain the @xmath7 chiral coefficients by expanding the vector meson propagators , leads @xcite to results about a factor of two smaller than the `` all order '' vmd term , which means keeping the full vector meson propagator .",
    "all this said , the chiral approach has been useful to unveil the physical mechanisms responsible for this decay , but it has become clear that the strict chiral counting has to be abandoned since the @xmath7 and higher orders involved in the full ( `` all order '' ) vmd results are larger than those of @xmath5 . for a review , see @xcite , together with an experimental upper bound .",
    "once the `` all order '' vmd results is accepted as the dominant mechanism , one can not forget the tree level exchange of other resonances around the 1 gev region . in comparison with vmd , the exchange of @xmath8 axial vectors @xcite yields negligible contributions when using values of the couplings in agreement with @xmath9 data @xcite . still at tree level , the @xmath1 exchange , which was taken into account approximately in @xcite , was one of the main sources of uncertainty , since even the sign of its contribution was unknown .",
    "after the tree level light resonance exchange have been taken into account , we should consider loop diagrams , since meson - meson interaction or rescattering can be rather strong .",
    "first of all we find the already commented @xmath5 kaon loops from chpt , but also the meson loops from the terms involving the exchange of one resonance . the uncertainty from the latter was roughly expected @xcite to be about 30% of the full width .",
    "another relevant question is that no attempts have been done to check the consistency of @xmath0 results with data from other processes . on the one hand ,",
    "the decay results have not been compared with the crossed channel @xmath10 , although some consistency tests with @xmath9 have been carried out as quoted above .",
    "the reason is not surprising since there are no hopes within chpt to reach the @xmath1 region where there are measurements of the @xmath10 cross section @xcite . on the other hand , the explicit su(3 )",
    "breaking already present in the radiative vector meson decays has not been taken into account when calculating the vmd tree level contributions .",
    "the former discussion has set the stage of the problem and the remaining uncertainties that allow for further improvement . in recent years , with the advent of unitarization methods , it has been possible to extend the results of chpt to higher energies where the perturbative expansion breaks down and to generate resonances up to 1.2 gev @xcite . in particular these ideas were used to describe the @xmath11 reaction , with good results in all the channels up to energies of around 1.2 gev @xcite .",
    "work in a similar direction for this latter reaction has also been done in @xcite . with these techniques , and always within the context of meson chiral lagrangians , we will address three of the problems stated above : first , the @xmath1 contribution , second , the evaluation of meson loops from vmd diagrams and , third , the consistency with the crossed channel @xmath10 . in particular , we will make use of the results in @xcite , where the @xmath10 cross section around the @xmath1 resonance was well reproduced using the same input as in meson meson scattering , without introducing any extra parameters .    with these improvements we are then left with a model that includes the `` all order '' vmd and resummed chiral loops .",
    "we expect this approach to provide a good description of @xmath0 because recent studies on the vector meson decay into two pseudoscalar mesons and one photon @xcite indicate that such a combination of `` all order '' vmd contribution plus the unitary summation of the chiral loops leads to good agreement with data in a variety of reactions .",
    "these include @xmath12 @xcite , where the chiral loops are dominant , @xmath13 @xcite , where the vmd mechanism is dominant , and @xmath14 @xcite where both mechanisms have about the same strength .    concerning the fourth issue of the su(3 ) breaking present in radiative vector meson decays",
    ", we will take it into account here by using effective couplings normalized to reproduce the most recent experimental data .    incidentally , there are preliminary results from a very recent experiment @xcite , which give a decay width about half of the previous one . in that work",
    "the authors refined the background subtraction , which was known to be rather problematic .",
    "let us remark that , in view of the former discussion , revisiting the previous theoretical calculations is mandatory regardless of whether these new experimental results are confirmed or not .",
    "in what follows we will address all these theoretical issues in detail , including an updated estimation of the uncertainties in the calculation .",
    "in particular , we will take into account the experimental errors in the radiative vector meson decays , which were neglected before , although they will turn out to be the largest source of uncertainty .",
    "following @xcite we consider the vmd mechanism of fig .  1    which can be easily derived from the vmd lagrangians involving vvp and @xmath15 couplings @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are standard @xmath19 matrices constructed with the nonet of vector mesons containing the @xmath20 , and the nonet of pseudoscalar mesons containing the @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "for instance for pseudoscalar mesons @xmath22 , with @xmath23 given by @xcite @xmath24 and similarly for vector mesons @xcite .",
    "we also assume the ordinary mixing for the @xmath25 , the @xmath26 , the @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32mev , with @xmath33 the coupling of @xmath20 to @xmath34 in the normalization of @xcite . > from eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) one can obtain the radiative widths for @xmath35 , which are given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the photon momentum for the vector meson at rest and @xmath38 are @xmath19 coefficients that we give in table 1 for the different radiative decays , together with the theoretical ( using @xmath39mev and @xmath32mev ) and experimental @xcite branching ratios .",
    "we shall refer to these results as those with `` universal couplings '' .    .",
    "su(3 ) @xmath38 coefficients together with theoretical and experimental branching ratios for different vector meson decay processes . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the agreement with the data is fair but the results can be improved by incorporating @xmath19 breaking mechanisms @xcite . for that purpose , we will normalize here the @xmath38 couplings so that the branching ratios in table 1 agree with experiment .",
    "these will be called results with `` normalized couplings '' . in this way we are taking into account phenomenologically the corrections to the @xmath40 vertex from an underlying field theory .",
    "once the @xmath40 couplings have been fixed , we can use them in the vmd amplitude corresponding to the diagram of fig .  1 , which is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the momentum of the @xmath27 and the two photons .",
    "we have parametrized the @xmath20 width phenomenologically as : @xmath45 whereas for the @xmath26 we have considered a constant @xmath46 mev",
    ". nevertheless , our results are rather insensitive to these details . from the above amplitude",
    ", the @xmath27 decay width is easily calculated , as well as the @xmath47 invariant mass distribution @xmath48 where we take for reference the momentum of the pion , @xmath49 , in the @xmath50 direction , so that @xmath51\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath26 the energy of the @xmath52 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the results of the mass distribution with and without the radiative widths normalization factors .",
    "the integrated width is given by @xmath53ev ( universal couplings ) ; @xmath54ev ( normalized couplings ) , where the error has been calculated from a monte carlo gaussian sampling of the normalization parameters within the errors of the experimental branching ratios of table 1 .",
    "let us note that there have been stable values for the vector meson radiative widths throughout the last decade in the pdg but a sizable change in the pdg2002 .",
    "had we used the pdg2000 , we would have obtained @xmath55ev ( normalized couplings ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with those in @xcite , where they used a universal su(3 ) coupling with @xmath33 adjusted to the @xmath56 decay data existing at that time , and obtained an `` all orders '' value of @xmath57ev .",
    "the difference between that value and the @xmath55ev that we would have obtained with older data has to be attributed to the adjusting to all the branching ratios , instead of just one as in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ]    our vmd normalized result is within three standard deviations from the value presently given in @xcite,@xcite : @xmath58ev , but within one sigma of the more recent one presented in @xcite , @xmath59ev .",
    "there are , however , other contributions that we consider next .",
    "the contribution of pion loops to @xmath0 , evaluated in @xcite , proceeds , to begin with , through the g - parity violating @xmath60 process . since the contribution is proportional to @xmath61 , it is very small and we think that if such terms are included , other isospin violating terms proportional to @xmath61 , and isospin violating corrections to the main terms should also be included . rather than undertaking this delicate task , we will use the results of @xcite to estimate uncertainties from all these sources .",
    "the main meson loop contribution comes from the charged kaon loops , calculated at @xmath5 in @xcite , and proceeds via @xmath62 .",
    "note that these loops are also suppressed due to the large kaon masses .",
    "that is why the @xmath63 mechanism was included explicitly , with uncertainties in the size and sign of the @xmath1 couplings .",
    "as commented in the introduction , the chiral unitary approach solves this problem by generating dynamically the @xmath1 in the @xmath64 amplitude .    in this section",
    ", we will illustrate this approach by revisiting the work done in @xcite on the related process @xmath65 where the chiral unitary approach was successfully applied around the @xmath1 region .",
    "since for the @xmath27 decay the low energy region of @xmath65 is also of interest , we will include next the vmd mechanisms also in this reaction .",
    "once we check that we describe correctly @xmath65 , the results can be easily translated to the eta decay .",
    "we will finally add other anomalous meson loops that are numerically relevant for eta decay but not for @xmath65 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that , within the unitary chiral approach , the @xmath66 amplitude around the @xmath1 region , diagrammatically represented at one loop in fig .",
    "3 , factorizes as @xmath67 with @xmath68 the full @xmath69 transition amplitude .",
    "the first three diagrams correspond to @xmath70 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tnpa629 ] ) , already evaluated at one loop in @xcite , where the factorization of the leading @xmath68 also occurred . in our case @xmath71 , written in a general gauge to be also used for the @xmath72 reaction , is given by @xmath73 ^ 2 \\right\\},\\ ] ] above the @xmath74 threshold , with the @xmath75 term removed below threshold . note that the unitarized @xmath68 transition matrix , not just the lowest order chiral amplitude , is factorized outside the loop integral .",
    "this on shell factorization was shown in @xcite by proving that the off shell part of the meson - meson amplitude did not contribute to the loop integral .",
    "the meson meson scattering amplitude was evaluated in @xcite by summing the bethe salpeter ( bs ) equation with a kernel formed from the lowest order meson chiral lagrangian amplitude and regularizing the loop function with a three momentum cut off .",
    "subsequently , other approaches like the inverse amplitude method @xcite or the @xmath76 method @xcite were used and all of them gave the same results in the meson scalar sector .",
    "for @xmath66 below 1 gev only the @xmath77 amplitudes are needed @xcite .",
    "the bs equation sums the diagrammatic series of fig .  4 ,    which implies that in the @xmath66 transition of fig .",
    "3 one is resumming the diagrams of fig .  5 .",
    "furthermore , the same on - shell factorization of the @xmath78 matrix in the loops found for @xmath66 was also justified for meson - meson scattering in @xcite .",
    "thus , the bs equation with coupled channels can be solved algebraically , leading to the following solution in matrix form @xmath79^{-1}t_2(s),\\ ] ] with @xmath80 the invariant mass of the two mesons , @xmath81 the lowest order chiral amplitude and @xmath82 a diagonal matrix , @xmath83 , accounting for the loop functions of two mesons .",
    "these @xmath84 functions were regularized in @xcite by means of a cut off .",
    "the @xmath84 analytic expressions , both using a cut off or dimensional regularization can be found in @xcite .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tnpa629 ] ) there is another term , @xmath85 , which corresponds to the last two diagrams of fig .  3 where the axial vector meson @xmath86 is exchanged . for the one loop result",
    "we follow @xcite .",
    "given the large mass of the axial vector , both the factorization of the unitarized on shell meson - meson scattering amplitude outside the loop , as well as that of the @xmath87 amplitude are also justified @xcite .",
    "hence , when the full series of fig .",
    "5 is considered , one obtains the contribution @xmath88 with @xmath89 given by @xmath90\\cdot g_{k\\overline{k}},\\ ] ] with @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "+ first of all we show in fig .  6 the result for the @xmath66 cross section obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tnpa629 ] ) , which coincides with that obtained in @xcite .    to ease the comparison with experimental data",
    "we also show the events concentrated in bins of 40 mev , roughly like the experimental ones .",
    "we can easily notice the peak of the @xmath1 whose dynamical generation is guaranteed by the resummation of diagrams in fig .",
    "the resummed @xmath93 amplitude has indeed a pole in the complex plane associated to the @xmath1 resonance @xcite .    in fig .  6",
    ", we also show results above and below @xmath1 , whose description requires further ingredients than those needed just for the @xmath1 region . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath94 resonance ( second peak ) is included phenomenologically as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in @xcite loops like those in fig .",
    "3 , but exchanging a vector meson instead of an axial - vector meson were estimated negligible in the @xmath1 region and hence neglected .",
    "in addition , the vmd tree level mechanism of fig .  1 ( with an outgoing @xmath27 ) was neglected since it has no resonant structure in the @xmath47 s - channel . as a consequence the agreement of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tnpa629 ] ) with experiment is fair but some discrepancies can be noticed in fig .  6 at low energies .      for the purpose of the present work , @xmath96 , the low energy region of the @xmath66 reaction is also relevant",
    ". therefore we will include as a novelty both the vmd tree level contribution as well as the loops involving vector meson exchange .",
    "first , we can see in fig .",
    "7 that the results obtained adding the tree level vmd amplitude normalized to the @xmath97 radiative decay rates ( dashed line ) are acceptable around and below the peak of the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "let us note that the inclusion of these terms does improve the description of the low energy region .",
    "the binning of the theoretical results would make again the apparent agreement with data to look much better , but for the sake of clarity we have not added more lines to the figure , as long as the binning effect has already been illustrated in fig .",
    "although in section one we have justified the use of the normalized couplings , we also show in fig .",
    "7 the result using universal couplings ( dotted line ) . in this process ,",
    "the effect of normalizing the couplings of the vector meson radiative decays is not as drastic as in fig .  2 for the @xmath27 decay where only the vmd mechanism was considered .",
    "in what follows we will only use the normalized couplings .",
    "second , in addition to the axial vector meson exchange in loops considered in the previous section , we have to include the loops with vector meson exchange for completeness .",
    "in fact , some of the uncertainties estimated in @xcite were linked to these loops . for consistency",
    ", once again we have to sum the series obtained by iterating the loops in the four meson vertex shown in fig .",
    "hence , the new amplitude , which we shall call @xmath98 , will be given by : @xmath99 \\label{vmdloops1}\\ ] ] where now @xmath100 is the factor that multiplies the @xmath101 product in the @xmath80-wave projection of the @xmath102 amplitude in the @xmath103 cm .",
    "although the lorentz structure of polarization vector products may seem rather complicated from eq .",
    "( [ tvmd ] ) , it is easy to show that after the s - wave projection the polarization vectors factorize indeed as @xmath101 . in a general frame",
    "the @xmath101 factor has to be replaced by @xmath104 .",
    "once again we have factorized the amplitudes for the same reasons as done with the other terms .    of course , when introducing loops with vector meson exchange we have to consider loops involving a @xmath105 or a @xmath106 exchanged between the photons ( see fig .",
    "8.b ) , which were not present at tree level .",
    "these would be given by @xmath107 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the contribution of all these new vmd loop diagrams is an increase of the order of 10 - 20% of the result shown in fig .  7 by the dashed line ( normalized vmd couplings ) .",
    "the new result would overlap in a large region with the dotted line of fig .",
    "7 and hence we do not show it explicitly .    in what follows we make some considerations about the diagrammatic interpretation of the `` all order '' vmd calculation , the normalization of the @xmath40 vertices and the meson - meson interaction .",
    "by `` all order '' vmd one means @xcite that the full vector meson propagator @xmath108 is used in the calculations .",
    "this full propagator includes self - energy diagrams in a dyson - schwinger resummation , leading to a shift of the bare mass and generating a width @xcite .",
    "thus , one must think in terms of self - energy insertions in the middle of the vector meson lines in fig .  1 and 8 .",
    "the @xmath40 coupling normalization to agree with the radiative vector meson decays can also be understood as considering vertex correction diagrams in fig.1 and 8 , and therefore it does not lead to any double counting with the dressing of the vector meson propagator .",
    "finally , the meson - meson interaction in the vmd terms leads to the diagrams of fig .  8 , in which the two pseudoscalar mesons interact through four - pseudoscalar meson vertices .",
    "the resummation of pseudoscalar meson - meson loops thus leaves apart the vector meson lines and the @xmath40 vertices .",
    "once again this ensures that there is no double counting .      in the @xmath109 case ,",
    "the meson loop diagrams correspond to those of @xmath110 but considering the @xmath52 as an outgoing particle .",
    "hence , it is enough to replace @xmath111 by @xmath112 in all the @xmath113 amplitudes , which factorize in all the loop diagrams that we have considered so far , and in the @xmath71 and @xmath114 function .",
    "since we are considering all the vmd diagrams and the chiral loops , we still have to take into account another kind of loop diagrams @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "9 , which involve two anomalous @xmath115 vertices . despite being @xmath116",
    "it has been found @xcite that they can have a non negligible effect on the @xmath27 decay .",
    "the further rescattering of the mesons in the diagrams of fig .  9 , given the structure of the @xmath117 vertex @xcite in the momenta of the particles , would be suppressed by factors of @xmath118 ( with @xmath119 the loop variable ) with respect to those considered for the vmd mechanism .",
    "this , and the fact that these anomalous terms are already small , makes the consideration of rescattering in these loops superfluous .",
    "therefore , it is enough to take the results from @xcite where it is found that their largest contribution comes from the kaon loops .",
    "we use eqs.(12),(13 ) and ( 27 ) of that reference ( note that there is a global change of sign with respect to our notation ) .",
    "concerning @xmath120 , these kind of loops have been neglected in the previous section , because the intermediate particles are very far off shell , due to the crossed character of the loop in the reaction .",
    "using the model described in the previous sections , we plot in fig .  10 the different contributions to @xmath121 .",
    "we can see that the largest contribution is that of the tree level vmd ( long dashed line ) .",
    "let us recall that this is a new result as long as we are using the vmd couplings normalized to agree with the vector radiative decays .",
    "the resummation of the loops in fig .",
    "3 using eq.([eq : tnpa629 ] ) , ( short dashed line ) gives a small contribution ( @xmath122ev in the total width ) , but when added coherently to the tree level vmd , leads to an increase of @xmath123% in the @xmath27 decay rate ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "more interestingly , the shape of the @xmath47 invariant mass distribution is appreciably changed with respect to the tree level vmd , developing a peak at high invariant masses .",
    "the resummed vmd loops in fig .",
    "8 , using eqs.([vmdloops1 ] ) and ( [ vmdloops2 ] ) , leads , through interference , to a moderate increase of the @xmath27 decay rate ( double dashed dotted line ) , smaller than that of the chiral loops considered before .",
    "the last ingredient is the contribution of the anomalous mechanisms of fig .",
    "9 ( continuous line ) , leading again to a moderate increase of the @xmath27 decay rate , also smaller than the chiral loops from eq.([eq : tnpa629 ] ) .",
    "these anomalous mechanisms have a very similar shape to the tree level vmd and interfere with it in the whole range of invariant masses .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ]    altogether , when integrating over the invariant mass , we get : @xmath124 note that the inclusion of the loops has increased the tree level vmd result by 50% .",
    "for comparison , we quote here what we would have obtained using the universal vmd couplings : @xmath125ev .",
    "so far , the theoretical error has been obtained only from the propagation of the experimental errors in the vector meson radiative decay branching ratios , given in table  1 . the errors from this source had not been considered before although they will turn out to produce the largest uncertainty . in practice",
    "we generate a gaussian weighted random value for each vmd coupling which yield a result for the width .",
    "this procedure is repeated a sufficiently large number of times , leading to an approximate gaussian distribution of results from where we obtain a central value and the error .",
    "we come now to revisit the uncertainties considered in @xcite .",
    "one of the largest sources to the @xmath126ev accepted uncertainties in that work , was the contribution of the @xmath1 , whose sign was unknown .",
    "this problem is solved in the present work since the @xmath1 is generated dynamically from the rescattering of the mesons implied in the bethe - salpeter resummation of the @xmath127 amplitude .",
    "hence its effect can be easily observed comparing with the standard chpt result , which is obtained by substituting the full @xmath127 by its lowest order @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "10 this corresponds to the difference between the continuous and the dotted line .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath1 resonance tail is rather small and increases the @xmath27 decay rate from @xmath128ev to @xmath129ev .",
    "the sign of its contribution is unambiguously determined .",
    "thus , the present calculation removes completely this source of error .",
    "the explicit calculation of the @xmath1 contribution giving such a small effect justifies neglecting the @xmath94 resonance contribution which lies much further away in energy .",
    "the other source of uncertainty in @xcite was the contribution of the vmd loops .",
    "we have been able to calculate them in this work and , as seen in fig .",
    "10 , these effects are also rather small .",
    "they increase the @xmath27 decay rate by @xmath130ev . altogether",
    "the @xmath1 plus the vmd loops increase the @xmath27 decay rate by @xmath131ev .",
    "we thus eliminate these two sources of previous uncertainties , while realizing at the same time that the uncertainties of @xmath132ev attributed to these sources in @xcite were indeed a generous upper bound .    in our approach",
    "the tree level exchange of the @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 axial resonances @xcite will be included as an uncertainty .",
    "the reason is that , according to @xcite , they would increase the decay width by about @xmath136ev .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , their inclusion in @xmath137 with the couplings used in @xcite would overestimate the @xmath137 cross section . in view of these discrepancies",
    ", we thus consider safe to accept a theoretical uncertainty of the order of @xmath138ev which should still be a generous upper bound .    as commented at the beginning of section three ,",
    "there are uncertainties due to isospin violating terms .",
    "we estimate the errors from this source using the results obtained in @xcite for the g - parity violating term corresponding to fig .  3 but with pion loops .",
    "this contribution is of the order of @xmath138ev to the total @xmath27 decay rate .    finally , by summing all errors in quadrature",
    ", we arrive to @xmath139    note that although we have considered a new error source from the uncertainties in the vector radiative decays , which turns out to be the largest one , we still have reduced the uncertainty from previous calculations .    the result of eq .",
    "( [ resultfinal ] ) is in remarkable agreement with the latest experimental number @xcite , and lie within two sigmas from the earlier ones in @xcite .",
    "confirmation of those preliminary results would therefore be important to test the consistency of this new approach .",
    "furthermore , precise measurements of the @xmath47 invariant mass distributions would be of much help given the differences found with and without loop contributions .",
    "we have reanalyzed the @xmath140 decay within the context of meson chiral lagrangians , gathering all the mechanisms discussed in the literature , but improving them in the following aspects :    on the one hand , using the well tested chiral unitary approach , we have removed the uncertainties from the @xmath1 resonance as well as those from loops with the exchange of one vector meson . in particular , since the @xmath1 is generated dynamically from the meson loop resummation , we have unambiguously determined the sign of its contribution , whereas for the one vector loops we have performed an explicit calculation that in previous works had only been considered as a large source of uncertainty .",
    "on the other hand , we have also checked the consistency with other related processes : first , a relevant observation is that the tree level vector meson dominance amplitude with a universal su(3 ) vector - vector - pseudoscalar coupling is not consistent with the @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 decays .",
    "consequently , throughout the @xmath140 calculation , we have used couplings normalized to agree with the radiative vector meson decays .",
    "second , we have established the consistency of our @xmath140 model with the related @xmath95 process .",
    "furthermore , we have performed a careful error analysis of our results . as a novelty we have considered the experimental errors in the vector meson radiative decay widths , which turn out to be the largest source of uncertainty . however , since , as just commented above , we have removed former sources of uncertainty , our final error is still smaller than previous estimates .",
    "altogether we have found a result of @xmath144ev .",
    "with the improved calculation just presented , it seems clear that the mechanisms thus far suggested in the literature in the context of meson chiral lagrangians lead to a result at variance with the experimental result @xmath58ev from @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noticing the agreement of the above result with the new preliminary measurement @xmath59ev from @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , a measurement of the invariant mass distribution would be more stringent .",
    "confirmation of the preliminary results of @xcite and an accurate measurement of the @xmath47 invariant mass distribution should be the experimental priorities to clarify the situation .",
