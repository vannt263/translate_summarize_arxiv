    "in the recent past , we have amassed a bewildering amount of information on our universe , and yet we are far from developing a holistic idea .",
    "this is because most of the natural and man - made real - world systems that we see around us are intricately wired and seemingly complex .",
    "much of these complex systems can be mapped as an interwoven web of large network if the constituents are regarded as nodes or vertices and the interactions between constituents as links or edges .",
    "for example , cells of living systems are networks of molecules linked by chemical interaction , brain is a network of neurons linked by axons , the internet is a network of routers and computers linked by cables or wireless connections , the power - grid is a network of substations linked by transmission lines , the world wide web ( www ) is a network of html document connected url addresses @xcite .",
    "equally , there are many variants of social networks where individuals are nodes or vertices linked by social intereactions like friendships , professional ties , there are citation network where articles are nodes linked by the corresponding citation etc . @xcite . the first theoretical attempt to guide our understanding about complex network topology began with the seminal work of two hungerians , paul erds and alfrd rnyi , in 1959 .",
    "the main result of the erds - rnyi ( er ) model is that the degree distribution @xmath7 , the probability that a randomly chosen node is connected to @xmath8 other nodes by one edge , is poissonian revealing that it is almost impossible to find nodes that have significantly higher or fewer links than the average degree .",
    "however , real networks are neither completely regular where all the nodes have the same degree @xmath8 nor completely random where the degree distribution is poissonian .    while studying real - life data of some of these systems , barabsi and albert found that the tail of the degree distribution @xmath7 , the probability that a randomly chosen node is connected to @xmath8 other nodes , always follows a power - law .",
    "in an attempt to explain this they realized that real networks are not static , rather they grow with time by continuous addition of new nodes .",
    "they further argued that the new nodes establish links to the well connected existing ones _ preferentially _ rather than _ randomly _ - known as the preferential attachment ( pa ) rule .",
    "it essentially embodies the intuitive idea of the _ rich get richer _ principle of the matthew effect in sociology @xcite . incorporating both concepts , they proposed a model and showed that networks thus grown exhibit power - law degree distribution @xmath9 with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "their findings resulted in a paradigm shift , yet we are compelled to note a couple of drawbacks .",
    "firstly , the pa rule of the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model is too direct in the sense that it requires each new node to know the degree of every node in the entire network .",
    "networks of scientific interest are often large , hence it is unreasonable to expect that new nodes join the network with such global knowledge .",
    "secondly , the exponent of the degree distribution assumes a constant value @xmath10 independent of @xmath0 while most natural and man - made networks have exponents @xmath11 . in order to avoid this drawback and to provide models that describe complex systems in more detail ,",
    "a few variants of the ba model and other models were proposed .",
    "examples feature mechanisms like rewiring , aging , ranking , redirection , vertex copying , duplication etc . @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that random sequential partition of a square into contiguous and non - overlapping blocks can be described as a network with power - law degree distribution if blocks are regarded as nodes and common border between blocks as links @xcite .    in this article , we present a model in which an incoming node randomly chooses an already connected node , and then connects itself not with that one but with @xmath0 neighbors of the chosen node at random .",
    "this idea is reminiscent of the growth of the weighted planar stochastic lattice ( wpsl ) in whose dual , existing nodes gain links only if one of its neighbor is picked .",
    "seeing that the dual of wpsl emerges as a network with power - law degree distribution , we became curious as to what happens if a graph is grown following a similar rule @xcite .",
    "we call it the mediation - driven attachment ( mda ) rule since the node that has been picked at random from all the already connected nodes acts as a mediator for connection between its neighbor and the new node .",
    "such a rule can embody the preferential attachment process since an already well - connected node has more mediators and through the mediated attachment process , it can gain even more neighbors . finding out the extent of preference in comparison to the pa rule of the ba model forms an important proposition of this work .",
    "there exists a host of networks where the presence of the mda rule is too obvious .",
    "for instance , while uploading a document to a website or writing a paper , we usually find documents to link with or papers to cite through mediators .",
    "in social networks such as friendships , co - authorship , facebook , and movie actor networks , people get to know each other through a mediator or through a common neighbor .",
    "thus the mda model can be a good candidate for describing social networks .    for small values of @xmath0 , the visual contrast ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ab ] ) of networks grown by the mda rule with those grown by the pa rule of the ba model is awe - inspiring . here we report that the mda rule for small @xmath0 is rather super - preferential as it gives rise to _ winners take all _",
    "( wta ) effect , where the hubs are regarded as the winners .",
    "the scenario is reminiscent of networks grown by the enhanced redirection model presented by gabel _",
    "_ where multiple macrohubs have been observed @xcite .",
    "however , for large @xmath0 , the mda growth rule increasingly acts more like the simple pa rule as the wta effect is replaced by _",
    "winners take some _ ( wts ) effect .",
    "we solve the model analytically using mean - field approximation ( mfa ) and show that the degree distribution exhibits power - law @xmath9 with a spectrum of exponents @xmath11 depending on @xmath0 such that @xmath12 , when @xmath0 is large .",
    "we perform extensive monte carlo simulation to verify the results .",
    "one of the characteristic features of scale - free networks is the existence of hubs which are linked to an exceptionally large number of nodes .",
    "the nodes in the network can be ranked according to the size of their degree .",
    "we show that the rank - size distribution can provide insights into the nature of the network . besides , we regard the richest of all the hubs , the one with the maximum degree , as the leader of the network . in the context of network theory ,",
    "we , for the first time , investigate the leadership persistence probability @xmath2 , that a leader retains its leadership up to the time @xmath3 , and find it to decay following power - law with a non - trivial persistence exponent @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , @xmath14 independently of @xmath0 for mda networks and for ba networks it approaches a constant value of @xmath15 exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "the growth of a network starts from a seed which is defined as a minature network consisting of @xmath16 nodes already connected in an arbitrary fashion .",
    "below we give an exact algorithm of the model because we think an algorithm can provide a better description of the model than the mere definition .",
    "it goes as follows :    1 .",
    "choose an already connected node at random with uniform probability and regard it as the mediator .",
    "2 .   pick @xmath0 of its neighbors also at random with uniform probability .",
    "3 .   connect the @xmath0 edges of the new node with the @xmath0 neighbors of the mediator .",
    "increase time by one unit .",
    "repeat steps ( i)-(iv ) till the desired network size is achieved .    to illustrate the mda rule",
    ", we consider a seed of @xmath17 nodes labeled @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "now the question is , what is the probability @xmath19 that an already connected node @xmath20 is finally picked and the new node connects with it ?",
    "say , the node @xmath20 has degree @xmath21 and its @xmath21 neighbors , labeled @xmath22 , have degrees @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we can reach the node @xmath20 from each of these @xmath21 nodes with probabilities inverse of their respective degrees , and each of the @xmath21 nodes can be picked at random with probability @xmath24 .",
    "we can therefore write @xmath25 = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{k_i}{\\frac{1}{k_j}}}{n}.\\ ] ] numerical simulation suggests that the probabilities @xmath19 are always normalized , i.e. @xmath26 .    the basic idea of the mda rule is not completely new as either this or models similar to this can be found in a few earlier works , albeit their approach , ensuing analysis and their results are different from ours . for instance ,",
    "saramki and kaski presented a random - walk based model where a walker first lands on an already connected node at random and then takes a random walk .",
    "the new node then connects itself to the node where the walker finally reaches after @xmath27 steps @xcite .",
    "our model will look exactly the same as the saramki - kaski ( sk ) model only if the new node arrives with @xmath28 edge and the walker takes @xmath29 random step .",
    "however , they proved that the expression for the attachment probability of their model is exactly the same as that of the ba model independently of the value of @xmath0 and @xmath27 . our exact expression for the attachment probability given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) suggests that it does not coincide with the ba model at all , especially for @xmath28 case . on the other hand , the model proposed by boccaletti _",
    "_ may appear similar to ours , but it markedly differs on closer look .",
    "the incoming nodes in their model has the option of connecting to the mediator along with its neighbors @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in has been shown in both @xcite and @xcite that the exponent @xmath10 independent of the value of @xmath0 , which is again far from what our model entails .    as far as the definition of the mda model is concerned , it is exactly the same as the one recently studied by yang _",
    "et al._. they too gave a form for @xmath19 and resorted to mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of their expressions are significantly different from ours , and we have justified our version of the mean - field approximation on a deeper level by drawing conclusions from our study of the inverse of the harmonic mean of degrees of the neighbors of each and every node in our simulated networks .",
    "we shall see below that their results , both by mean - field approximation and numerical simulation , do not agree with our findings . yet another closely related model is the growing network with redirection ( gnr ) model presented by gabel , krapivsky and redner where at each time step a new node either attaches to a randomly chosen target node with probability @xmath30 , or to the parent of the target with probability @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the gnr model with @xmath32 may appear similar to our model .",
    "however , it should be noted that unlike the gnr model , the mda model is for undirected networks , and that the new link can connect with any neighbor of the mediator- parent or not .",
    "one more difference is that , in our model new node may join the existing network with @xmath0 edges and they considered @xmath28 case only .",
    "we shall show that the role of @xmath0 in this model is crucial .",
    "[ fig3 ]    [ fig4 ]    the rate at which an arbitrary node @xmath20 gains links is given by @xmath33 the factor @xmath0 takes care of the fact that any of the @xmath0 links of the newcomer may connect with the node @xmath20 . solving eq . when @xmath19 is given by eq",
    ". seems quite a formidable task unless we can simplify it . to this end",
    ", we find it convenient to re - write eq .",
    "as @xmath34 the factor @xmath35 is the inverse of the harmonic mean ( ihm ) of degrees of the @xmath21 neighbors of a node @xmath20 .",
    "we performed extensive numerical simulation to find out the nature of the ihm value of each node .",
    "we find that for small @xmath0 ( roughly @xmath36 ) , their values fluctuate so wildly that the mean of the ihm values over the entire network bears no meaning .",
    "it can be seen from the frequency distributions of the ihm values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram_inset_fluctuations ] .",
    "however , as @xmath0 increases beyond @xmath37 the frequency distributions gradually become more symmetric and the fluctuations occur at increasingly lesser extents , and hence the meaning of the mean ihm seems to be more meaningful .",
    "also interesting is the fact that for a given @xmath0 we find that the mean ihm value in the large @xmath38 limit becomes constant which is demonstrated in fig . [ fig : m70_beta_approximate_vs_n_verification_of_law ] .",
    "the two factors that the mean of the ihm is meaningful and it is independent of @xmath38 implies that we can apply the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "that is , within this approximation we can replace the true ihm value of each node by their mean . in this way , all the information on correlations in the fluctuations is lost .",
    "the good thing is that it makes the problem analytically tractable .",
    "one immediate consequence of it is that the mda rule with @xmath39 , like the ba model , is preferential in character since we get @xmath40 .",
    "it implies that the higher the links ( degree ) a node has , the higher its chance of gaining more links since they can be reached in a larger number of ways through mediators which essentially embodies the intuitive idea of rich get richer mechanism .",
    "therefore , the mda network can be seen to follow the pa rule but in disguise . moreover , for small @xmath0 the mfa is no longer valid .",
    "we shall see below that for small @xmath0 the attachment probability is in fact superpreferential in character .",
    "it is noteworthy that the size @xmath38 of the network is an indicative of time @xmath41 since we assume that only one node joins the network at each time step .",
    "thus , for @xmath42 we can write @xmath43 . using this , eq . , and mfa in eq .",
    ", we find the rate equation in a form that is easy to solve , which is @xmath44 here we assumed that the mean ihm is equal to @xmath45 for large @xmath0 where the factor @xmath0 in the denominator is introduced for future convenience .",
    "solving the above rate equation subject to the initial condition that the @xmath20th node is born at time @xmath46 with @xmath47 gives , @xmath48 as the fig .",
    "( [ fig : kth2.eps ] ) shows , the numerical results are in good agreement with this growth law for @xmath49 . note that the solution for @xmath49 is exactly the same as that of the ba model except the fact that the numerical value of the exponent @xmath50 is different and depends on @xmath0 .",
    "we , therefore , can immediately write the solution for the degree distribution @xmath51 the most immediate difference of this result from that of the ba model is that the exponent @xmath52 depends on @xmath0 .    [ fig5 ]    [ fig6 ]    to verify eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) we plot @xmath53 vs. @xmath54 in fig .",
    "( [ fig : deg_dist_gm ] ) using data extracted from numerical simulation . in all cases ,",
    "we find straight lines with characteristic fat - tail which confirms that our analytical solution is in agreement with the numerical solution .",
    "it is important to note that , for small @xmath0 , especially for @xmath28 and @xmath55 , there is one point in each of the @xmath53 vs. @xmath54 plots that stands out alone .",
    "these special points correspond to @xmath56 for @xmath28 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "this implies that almost @xmath59 and @xmath60 of all already connected nodes are held together by a few hubs and super - hubs for @xmath28 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "this huge percentage of nodes are minimally connected and this embodies the intuitive idea of wta phenomenon .",
    "we find that as @xmath0 increases , this percentage decreases and roughly at about @xmath37 , all the data points follow the same smooth trend revealing a transition from the wta effect to the wts effect .",
    "this happens when the ihm has less noise and the mean of ihm becomes increasingly more meaningful .",
    "the ihm value can thus be regarded as a measure of the extent up to which the degree distribution follows power - law . in their gnr model with enhanced redirection mechanisms , gabel , krapivsky and",
    "redner also noticed such highly dispersed networks which tend to be dominated by one or a few high - degree nodes @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the exponent @xmath52 of the degree distribution increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "we used gnuplot to fit the function @xmath61 to the @xmath52 versus @xmath0 data and find that the data satisfies the relation @xmath62 quite well .",
    "the asymptotic standard errors in the values of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "this result stands in sharp contrast with that of yang _",
    "et al . _ who found the exponent @xmath52 to vary in the range from @xmath69 to @xmath70 @xcite . also , for @xmath28 , which is the case closest to @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the sk model , we found that @xmath71 and not @xmath72 . on the other hand , in the large @xmath0 limit we find @xmath12 .",
    "it hints at a possible similarity with the ba model where @xmath73 . to find the extent of similarity or dissimilarity of our model with the ba model",
    ", we tuned the values of @xmath0 and looked at the rank - size distribution .",
    "the rank - size distribution can be found to describe remarkable regularity in many phenomena including the distribution of city sizes , the sizes of businesses , the frequencies of word usage , and wealth among individuals @xcite . these are all real - world observations where the rank - size distributions follow power - laws . in our case , we measured the size of each node by its degree , and the nodes which have the largest degree are given rank @xmath74 , the nodes which have the second - largest degree rank @xmath55 , and so on .",
    "assuming @xmath75 to be the size of the nodes having rank @xmath31 we plotted @xmath76 vs @xmath77 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rank_size ] .",
    "it clearly reveals that the size distribution of nodes decays with rank following the pareto law .",
    "note that , the power - law distribution pattern for the rank - size is often found to be true only when very small sizes are excluded from the sample .",
    "however , our main focus is on the difference between the ba and the mda model .",
    "clearly , for small @xmath0 , the size of the hubs of an mda ( @xmath75 with small @xmath31 ) network is far more rich than that of a ba network .",
    "however , for large @xmath0 , the rank distributions of the two networks become almost identical and this is consistent with the fact that the exponent @xmath78 of the mda network in the large @xmath0 limit coincides with that of the ba network .",
    "in the growing network not all nodes are equally important .",
    "the extent of their importance is measured by the value of their degree @xmath8 .",
    "nodes which are linked to an unusually large number of other nodes , i.e. nodes with exceptionally high @xmath8 value , are known as hubs .",
    "they are special because their existence make the mean distance , measured in units of the number of links , between nodes incredibly small thereby playing the key role in spreading rumors , opinions , diseases , computer viruses etc .",
    "@xcite . it is , therefore , important to know the properties of the largest hub , which we regard as the leader . like in society",
    ", the leadership in a growing network is not permanent .",
    "that is , once a node becomes the leader , it does not mean that it remains the leader _",
    "ad infinitum_. an interesting question is : how long does the leader retain this leadership property as the network evolves ? to find an answer to this question , we define the leadership persistence probability @xmath2 that a leader retains its leadership for at least up to time @xmath3",
    ". persistence probability has been of interest in many different systems ranging from coarsening dynamics to fluctuating interfaces or polymer chains @xcite .",
    "we find it worthwhile to look into the leadership persistence probability @xmath2 first in mda networks and then in ba networks to see their difference .",
    "we perform @xmath79 independent realizations under the same condition and take records of the duration time @xmath3 in which leadership has not changed .",
    "the leadership persistence probability @xmath2 is then obtained by finding the relative frequency of leadership change out of @xmath80 independent realizations within time @xmath3 .",
    "the plots in ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "( [ fig : persistenc ] ) , show @xmath81 as a function of @xmath82 for ba and mda networks respectively . in each case , we have shown plots for @xmath28 and @xmath83 to be able to appreciate the role of @xmath0 in determining the persistence exponent @xmath13 . these plots for different @xmath0 result in straight lines revealing that persistence probability decays as @xmath84",
    "one of the characteristic features of @xmath2 is that like @xmath7 , it too has a long tail with scarce data points that results in a `` fat '' or `` messy '' tail when we plot it in the log - log scale .",
    "the persistence exponent @xmath85 carries interesting and useful information about the full history of the dynamics of the system .",
    "therefore , its prediction is of particular importance .",
    "we find that the exponent @xmath85 for mda networks is almost equal to @xmath86 independently of @xmath0 . on the other hand , in the case of ba networks",
    ", it rises to @xmath15 exponentially with @xmath0 i.e. , it depends on @xmath0 .",
    "this is just the opposite of what happens to the exponent @xmath52 of the degree distribution . in many natural and man - made networks ,",
    "the leadership is a stochastic variable as it varies with time .",
    "for instance , the leader in the world wide web is not static , and hence it would be interesting to see the leadership persistence properties there .",
    "one could also look at such persistence properties in other growing networks .",
    "in this paper , we have elaborated on a mediation driven attachment rule for growing networks that exhibit power - law degree distribution . at a glance",
    ", it may seem that it defies the pa rule that barabsi and albert argued to be an essential ingredient for the emergence of power - law degree distribution .",
    "however , we have shown explicitly that the mda rule is in fact not only preferential but also super - preferential in some cases . in most cases , it embodies at least the intuitive idea of the pa rule , albeit in disguise .",
    "we obtained an exact expression for the mediation - driven attachment probability @xmath19 with which a new node picks an already connected node @xmath20 . solving the model",
    "analytically for the exact expression of @xmath19 appeared to be a formidable task .",
    "however , the good news is that we could still find a way to solve it using mean - field approximation .",
    "later , it turned out that not being able to solve analytically for the exact expression for @xmath19 was highly rewarding as it helped us gain deeper insight into the problem .",
    "while working with the expression for @xmath19 , we realized that the ihm value plays a crucial role in the model .",
    "we have found that the fluctuations in the ihm values of the existing nodes are so wild for small @xmath0 , that the mean bears no meaning and hence mean - field approximation is not valid .",
    "however , for large @xmath0 , the fluctuations get weaker and their distribution starts to peak around the mean , revealing that the mean has a meaning .",
    "this is the regime where mfa works well and we verified it numerically .",
    "here we found that the wta phenomenon is replaced by the wts phenomenon . besides , we all know that the leader of the hubs is the most important of all nodes in the sense that it is the most connected .",
    "we investigated the leadership persistence probability in both ba and mda networks and found that it decays following a power - law .",
    "we found that the persistence exponent @xmath87 is independent of @xmath0 for mda networks and grows to a constant @xmath88 exponentially with @xmath0 for ba networks .",
    "we hope to extend our work to study dynamic scaling and universality classes in networks grown using the mda model for different @xmath0 , and check how they differ from similar aspects in the ba model @xcite ."
