    "the recent announcement of bicep2 observations @xcite of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath3 claim the b - mode polarisation signatures to be produced completely due to the primordial gravity waves arising from the early inflation .",
    "however , we think that this belief is misplaced and the observed value of @xmath4 must include the contributions not only from the early inflation but also the contributions from the present acceleration of the universe .",
    "in fact , this acceleration being of the recent origin and of a much longer duration ( by many orders ) must contribute significantly , and so the later contributions on the b - mode polarisation of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) must be more marked than due to the early inflation , whose sole contribution was reported by planck @xcite .",
    "we recall that the cosmological and astrophysical observations support the fact our universe is in accelerated expansion phase @xcite , albeit the exact form of scale factor has not yet been fixed by any observations . heading from this motivation",
    "previously we adopted the quasi - exponential expansion that can also produce the significant tensor fluctuations of spacetime @xcite . in @xcite the cosmological constant @xmath5 with the energy density of the self - interaction of scalar bosons bound in a condensate is identified . in this approach , @xmath5 decay provides with a dynamical realization of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the detailed kinematics of @xmath5 decay and the back reaction of the decay products on the @xmath5 dynamics are given in @xcite .",
    "the slow evaporation regime is found here for a wide range of possible parameters of particle interactions .",
    "the present paper is organised into five sections . in section",
    "@xmath6 we study the mutual interaction among the higgs - like tachyon field components wherein the gravity waves unleashed by the earlier inflation may be further boosted by the present acceleration of the universe , and may appear beyond the planck upper bounds @xcite .",
    "section @xmath7 is laid for @xmath1-diagnostic and section @xmath8 is devoted towards @xmath9-diagnostic and statefinder parameters for interacting components of tachyonic field .",
    "the lagrangian for the tachyonic scalar field appears from string theory @xcite and is given from the action    @xmath10    as @xmath11 whereas the energy - momentum tensor    @xmath12    leads to pressure and energy density of the tachyonic scalar field as @xmath13 and @xmath14 for spatially homogeneous tachyonic scalar field we have @xmath15 @xmath16 here , we assume that radiation with equation of state @xmath17 also exists as one inherent component of same tachyonic scalar field . due to some physical mechanism",
    "not known in detail at present to us , but that may be like a higgs mechanism , we can split the expressions ( [ n6 ] ) and ( [ n7 ] ) as @xmath18    @xmath19    from ( [ n8 ] ) and ( [ n9 ] ) it is seen that when we include radiation in tachyonic scalar field then one new exotic component also appears ( say , exotic matter since its energy density is negative ) with zero pressure .",
    "thus , the tachyonic scalar field resolves into three components say @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the pressure and energy density of @xmath20 is given as @xmath23 this is nothing but the ` true ' cosmological constant because of its equation of state being @xmath24 .",
    "the second component with @xmath25 can be identified as radiation with @xmath26 the last component is characterised by @xmath27 this component mimics dust matter but has negative energy density",
    ". the exotic matter may include the dirac fermions as well as the majorana fermions whence the negative energy states turn into the positive energy states@xcite .    in our earlier work",
    "@xcite we allowed a small time dependent perturbation in the equation of state(eos ) of the cosmological constant with @xmath28    thus , with the perturbed eos , the true cosmological constant becomes a shifted cosmological parameter .",
    "this has a bearing upon the eos of radiation and exotic matter , both .",
    "therefore , these two entities turn into shifted radiation and shifted exotic matter respectively . with fixed energy density of field components ,",
    "the expressions for the energy density and pressure of each component are given as below .",
    "for the shifted cosmological constant one has    @xmath29    @xmath30    and @xmath28    for shifted radiation , we have    @xmath31    @xmath32    with @xmath33    in presence of perturbation the zero pressure of exotic matter turns into negative non - zero pressure due to shifted exotic matter which would also accelerate the universe like dark energy .",
    "thus , the energy density and pressure for shifted exotic matter are now , respectively , given as    @xmath34    @xmath35    with @xmath36",
    "the interacting dark energy models have been recently proposed by several authors @xcite .",
    "why must the components of tachyonic scalar field interact ?",
    "this is one of the interesting questions about interaction . since all components are in thermodynamic non - equilibrium , therefore , to achieve an equilibrium state they must fall into mutual interaction .",
    "we propose that the currently ongoing acceleration must also boost the tensor - scalar fluctuations caused by the early inflation , and the interaction among the components may be responsible for this boost beyond the planck bounds @xcite . with this motivation we study the interaction of these components assuming that even though the total energy of the perturbed field ( spatially homogeneous ) is kept conserved , yet",
    "during interaction it can get reasonably violated for individual components .",
    "the equations for conservation of energy with interaction are given as    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the interaction strengths . in the above expressions ( [ n16]),([n17 ] ) and ( [ n18 ] ) the following broad conditions must govern the dynamics .",
    "* condition(i ) * @xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to the following cases ,    ( i ) : :    if @xmath43 , @xmath44 then the right    hand side of ( [ n16 ] ) is negative while ( [ n17 ] ) and ( [ n18 ] ) are    positive , respectively .",
    "this means that there is energy transfer from    shifted cosmological parameter to shifted radiation and shifted exotic    matter , respectively .",
    "thermodynamics allows this kind of transfer of    energy .",
    "( ii ) : :    @xmath45 , @xmath46 implies that there is    an energy transfer to shifted cosmological parameter from shifted    radiation and shifted exotic matter .",
    "* condition(ii ) * @xmath47 .",
    "( i ) : :    @xmath44 , @xmath43 would make the right    hand side of ( [ n17 ] ) as positive and ( [ n16 ] ) and ( [ n18 ] ) as negative .",
    "this shows that there is an energy transfer to shifted radiation from    shifted cosmological parameter and shifted exotic matter .",
    "thermodynamics again does not allow this kind interaction .",
    "( ii ) : :    @xmath45 , @xmath46 makes way for the    energy transfer from shifted radiation to shifted exotic matter and    shifted cosmological parameter .",
    "* condition(iii ) * if @xmath48 then we have the following possibility    ( i ) : :    @xmath49 leads to an energy transfer to shifted radiation    from shifted cosmological parameter , while the shifted exotic matter    remains free from interaction with its energy density held conserved .",
    "this type of interaction holds compatibility with the laws of    thermodynamics .",
    "( ii ) : :    if @xmath50 , energy would flow from shifted radiation to    shifted cosmological parameter , whereas the shifted exotic matter does    not get involved in interaction mechanism .",
    "thus , the conservation of    energy for shifted exotic matter holds good .",
    "( iii ) : :    as an alternative , @xmath51 would pull the components of    tachyonic scalar field out of mutual interaction like the standard    @xmath5cdm model .",
    "the second case of condition ( i ) and condition(ii ) violate the laws of thermodynamics , therefore , we are not interested in these types of interactions . the interaction of type condition ( iii ) has been previously discussed for two components of tachyonic scalar field in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the positivity of the quantity @xmath52 implies that @xmath40 should be large and positive . for",
    "if @xmath40 had been large and negative then the second law of thermodynamics would have been violated and the cosmological constant ( as the dark energy candidate ) would have dominated much earlier withholding the structure formation against the present observations . also , @xmath53 should be positive and small since if it is negative and large then conservation of energy of tachyonic field is violated .",
    "the interaction strengths @xmath40 and @xmath53 should depend on temperature also , but due to mathematical simplification following the occam s razor , we consider the interaction strength as independent of temperature . on the left hand side of energy conservation equation",
    "are hubble parameter ( reciprocal of dimension of time ) and energy density thus it is natural choice that the interaction strength should be function of hubble parameter and energy density .",
    "several authors have proposed different forms of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "owing to the lack of information regarding the exact nature of dark matter and dark energy ( as the cosmological constant or else ) we can not yet fix the exact form of interaction strength .",
    "thus , with this motivation we present the form of interaction term heuristically as function of time rate of change in energy densities as    1 .",
    "@xmath55 2 .   @xmath56    where @xmath57 are proportionality constant .",
    "the total conservation of energy of field is ensured by    @xmath58    with @xmath59 and hubble parameter @xmath60 given from    @xmath61\\label{n21}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from ( [ n16 ] ) , ( [ n17 ] ) and ( [ n18 ] ) , the functional form of energy density with redshift @xmath62 is given as @xmath63 where @xmath64    @xmath65    and    @xmath66\\nonumber\\\\-\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\bar{\\rho}^{0}_{r}(4 + 3\\varepsilon)}{4 + 3\\varepsilon-\\eta+\\eta\\beta}\\right)[x^{4 + 3\\varepsilon/1-\\beta}-x^{\\eta}]\\label{n24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 ( constant ) is defined as    @xmath68    it is clearly seen that in the absence of perturbation , @xmath69 does not play any role in the evolution of the matter component and so delinks it from the coextensive evolution of the shifted cosmological parameter . in that case",
