    "in this paper , we consider convex subsets of semimodules over semirings with an idempotent addition , like the max - plus semifield @xmath4 , which is the set @xmath5 , with @xmath6 as addition , and @xmath7 as multiplication .",
    "convex subsets @xmath8 , or , satisfy @xmath9 where the operation `` @xmath10''should be understood componentwise , and where @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "we say that a function @xmath13 is if its epigraph is max - plus convex .",
    "an example of max - plus convex function is depicted in figure  [ fig : fconvex ] ( further explanations will be given in   [ sec - fconvex ] ) .     and",
    "its supporting half spaces ]    motivations to study semimodules and convex sets over idempotent semirings arise from several fields .",
    "first , semimodules over idempotent semirings , which include as special cases sup - semilattices with a bottom element ( which are semimodules over the boolean semiring ) , are natural objects in lattice theory .",
    "a second motivation arises from dynamic programming and discrete optimization .",
    "early results in this direction are due to cuninghame - green ( see  @xcite ) , vorobyev  @xcite , romanovski  @xcite , k.  zimmermann  @xcite .",
    "the role of max - plus algebra in hamilton - jacobi equations and quasi - classical asymptotics , discovered by maslov  ( * ? ? ?",
    "vii ) led to the development of an `` idempotent analysis '' , by kolokoltsov , litvinov , maslov , samborski , shpiz , and others ( see  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "a third motivation arises from the algebraic approach of discrete event systems  @xcite : control problems for discrete event systems are naturally expressed in terms of invariant spaces  @xcite .",
    "another motivation , directly related to the present work , comes from abstract convex analysis  @xcite : a basic result of convex analysis states that convex lower semi - continuous functions are upper hulls of affine maps , which means precisely that the set of convex functions is the max - plus ( complete ) semimodule generated by linear maps . in the theory of generalized conjugacies , linear maps are replaced by a general family of maps , and the set of convex functions is replaced by a general semimodule .",
    "more precisely , given an abstract class of convex sets and functions , a basic issue is to find a class of elementary functions with which convex sets and functions can be represented .",
    "this can be formalized in terms of  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath14 is a set and @xmath15 , a function @xmath16 is called @xmath17-_convex _ if there exists a subset @xmath18 of @xmath17 such that @xmath19 a subset @xmath20 of @xmath14 is said to be @xmath17-_convex _",
    "@xcite if for each @xmath21 we can find a map @xmath22 such that @xmath23 in this paper , we address the problem of finding the set @xmath17 adapted to max - plus convex sets and functions .",
    "the analogy with classical algebra suggests to introduce functions : @xmath24 with @xmath25 , and functions , which are of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 . in the max - plus case",
    ", we can not take for @xmath17 the set of affine or linear functions , because any sup of max - plus affine ( resp .",
    "linear ) functions remains max - plus affine ( resp .",
    "this is illustrated in the last ( bottom right ) picture in figure  [ fig : affine ] , which shows the graph of a generic affine function in dimension @xmath28 ( the graph is the black broken line , see table  [ tab:1 ] in  [ sec - fconvex ] for details ) .",
    "it is geometrically obvious that we can not obtain the convex function of figure  [ fig : fconvex ] as the sup of affine functions .",
    "( linear functions , however , lead to an interesting theory if we consider max - plus functions instead of max - plus convex functions , see rubinov and singer  @xcite , and downward sets instead of max - plus convex sets , see martnez - legaz , rubinov , and singer  @xcite . )",
    "we show here that for max - plus convex functions , and more generally for convex functions over conditionally complete idempotent semifields , the appropriate @xmath17 consists of of affine functions , which are of the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are affine functions , and @xmath31 denotes the residuated law of the semiring addition , defined in   below .",
    "theorem  [ tconverse ] shows that lower semi - continuous convex functions are precisely upper hulls of residuated differences of affine functions , and corollary  [ cor - uconvex ] shows that the corresponding @xmath17-convex sets are precisely the closed convex sets .    as an illustration , in the case of the max - plus semiring , in dimension @xmath28",
    ", there are 4 kinds of residuated differences of affine functions , as shown in figure  [ fig : affine ] , and table  [ tab:1 ] : one of these types consists of affine functions ( bottom right , already discussed ) , another of these types consists only of the identically @xmath32 function ( top left , not visible ) , whereas the top right and bottom left plots yield new shapes , which yield `` supporting half - spaces '' for the convex function of figure  [ fig : fconvex ] .",
    "the main device in the proof of these results is a separation theorem for closed convex sets ( theorem  [ th-1 ] ) .",
    "we consider a convex subset @xmath20 of @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is an idempotent semifield that is conditionally complete for its natural order .",
    "then , we show that if @xmath20 is stable under taking sups of ( bounded ) directed subsets and infs of ( bounded ) filtered subsets , or equivalently , if @xmath20 is closed in birkhoff s order topology , and if @xmath33 , there exists an affine hyperplane @xmath34 with @xmath30 as in  , containing @xmath20 and not @xmath35 . when @xmath36 , birkhoff s order topology coincides with the usual one , and we get a separation theorem for convex subsets of @xmath37 which are closed in the usual sense .",
    "a key discrepancy , by comparison with usual convex sets , is that a two sided equation @xmath38 is needed .",
    "theorem  [ th-1 ] extends or refines earlier results by zimmermann  @xcite , samborski and shpiz  @xcite , and by the three first authors  @xcite .",
    "some metric assumptions on the semifield , which were used in  @xcite , are eliminated , and the proof of theorem  [ th-1 ] is in our view simpler ( with a direct geometric interpretation in terms of projections ) .",
    "the method of  @xcite only applies to the case where the vector @xmath35 does not have entries equal to the bottom element .",
    "this restriction is removed in theorem  [ th-1 ] ( see example  [ ex - ncex ] below for details ) . by comparison with  @xcite ,",
    "the difference is that we work here in conditionally complete semifields ( without a top element ) , whereas the result of  @xcite applies to the case of complete semirings ( which necessarily have a top element ) .",
    "when the top element is a coefficient of an affine equation defining an hyperplane , the hyperplane need not be closed in the order topology , and a key part of the proof of theorem  [ th-1 ] is precisely to eliminate the top element from the equation defining the hyperplanes . in many applications ,",
    "birkhoff s order topology is the natural one , so that the present theorem  [ th-1 ] gives a useful refinement of the universal separation result of  @xcite .",
    "we finally point out additional references in which semimodules over idempotent semirings or related structures appear : @xcite .",
    "in this section , we recall some basic notions about partially ordered sets , residuation , idempotent semirings and semimodules .",
    "see  @xcite for more details . by ,",
    "we will mean throughout the paper a set equipped with a order .",
    "we say that an ordered set @xmath39 is if any subset @xmath40 has a least upper bound ( denoted by @xmath41 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath42 has both a minimal ( bottom ) element @xmath43 , and a maximal ( top ) element @xmath44 .",
    "since the greatest lower bound of a subset @xmath40 can be defined by @xmath45 , @xmath42 is a complete lattice .",
    "we shall also consider the case where @xmath42 is only , which means that any subset of @xmath42 bounded from above has a least upper bound and that any subset of @xmath42 bounded from below has a greatest lower bound .",
    "if @xmath39 and @xmath46 are ordered sets , we say that a map @xmath47 is if there exists a map @xmath48 such that @xmath49 which means that for all @xmath50 , the set @xmath51 has a maximal element , @xmath52 . if @xmath53 is an ordered set , we denote by @xmath54 the ordered set , for which @xmath55 .",
    "due to the symmetry of the defining property  , it is clear that if @xmath56 is residuated , then @xmath57 is also residuated . when @xmath58 are complete ordered sets , there is a simple characterization of residuated maps .",
    "we say that a map @xmath56 if for all @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath62 , we get @xmath63 .",
    "one easily checks that if @xmath39 and @xmath46 are complete ordered sets , then , a map @xmath56 is residuated if , and only if , it preserves arbitrary sups ( see  ( * ? ? ?",

    "this also implies that : @xmath71    we now apply these notions to idempotent semirings and semimodules .",

    "however , a conditionally complete semifield @xmath72 can be embedded in a complete semiring @xmath89 , which is obtained by adjoining to @xmath72 a top element , @xmath90 , and setting @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
