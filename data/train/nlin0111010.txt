    "for quantum chaotic closed system it is well known that the statistical properties of the energy levels are described by random matrix theory ( rmt)@xcite .",
    "they follow the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) and the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , depending on whether time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) of a system is preserved or not . in the same way",
    "the wave function statistics obeys different laws in the two cases .",
    "let the scaled local density be @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the normalized wave function and @xmath2 is the area ( volume ) of the system .",
    "as prescribed by goe the probability distribution is the well - known porter - thomas ( p - t ) distribution @xmath3 when trs is present ( the hamiltonian @xmath4 is invariant under time reversal @xmath5 and @xmath6 may be chosen real ) . on the other hand",
    ", the distribution takes the exponential rayleigh form @xmath7 as described by gue when trs is broken ( @xmath4 is not invariant on @xmath8 and @xmath6 must be complex ) .",
    "it is easy to understand qualitatively why the statistics is so different in the two cases , for example , why small values of @xmath9 have a much larger weight in goe than in gue . in the first case the real wave function vanishes along nodal lines in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems ( surfaces in 3d ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath6 is complex in the second case and vanishes only at nodal points ( lines in 3d ) resulting in less probability for small @xmath9 .",
    "depending on the relative weights of the orthogonal real and imaginary parts of @xmath6 one can also define intermediate statistics that applies to the entire crossover region from goe to gue@xcite .",
    "we now consider what happens when the system is made open , for example by attaching electron leads to some exterior reservoirs and a stationary current through the system is induced by applying suitable voltages to the reservoirs . the additional flexibility gained in this way leads to a number of interesting cases for the wave function statistics",
    "let us first look at the case when there is no current flow .",
    "the statistics will then be the same as for the closed system above , _",
    "i.e. _ , the kind of statistics simply depends on whether the hamiltonian is invariant under @xmath8 or not . on the other hand , if there is a stationary current via the leads we have to deal with a scattering wave function .",
    "this function , which must be complex , is written in 2d as @xmath10 and satisfies @xmath11 .",
    "even if the hamiltonian itself is invariant under @xmath8 , the statistics will not follow goe since the scattering wave function is complex . because of the boundary conditions associated with the scattering wave function it is no longer an eigenstate of the usual time reversal operator @xmath12 where @xmath13 is complex conjugation of @xmath14 .",
    "we will show how the two gaussian random fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 are identified to recover the intermediate statistics discussed above and how a universal distribution for the probability current density can be found .",
    "we will also compare theory with explicit numerical calculations for an open bunimovich stadium .",
    "in the following derivation of the wave function and probability current statistics we assume that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath6 can be viewed as two independent isotropic gaussian fields .",
    "an explict example of such a state is given in ref .",
    "@xcite in the form of a berry - type wave - chaotic function . in general",
    "the assumption of independent fields can only make sense if we first extract a common phase factor .",
    "this feature will turn out to be most useful .",
    "let us introduce the notations @xmath17 @xmath18    we define the averages as @xmath19 where @xmath2 is the area to be sampled",
    ". in our case it will be area of the cavity , but in principle it could be any area that one may wish to diagnose . in what follows",
    "we assume that wave function @xmath1 is normalized as @xmath20 and therefore @xmath21 . to bring @xmath6 to a `` diagonal '' form in which the real and imaginary parts are independent gaussian fields we introduce the new functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 by changing the phase as    @xmath24    the condition @xmath25 now allows us to determine @xmath26",

    "( [ phasetrans ] ) the limits @xmath44 correspond to a closed system and as a consequence one recovers the p - t distribution and goe statistics . on the other hand",
    ", the case @xmath45 corresponds in this context to an open system through which there is a current flow .",

    "i.e. , @xmath46 is not merely a fitting parameter_. we have recently verified this type of crossover in wave function statistics for a bunimovich stadium using numerical scattering methods@xcite .    in view of all previous work on the generic form of wave function statistics in chaotic systems it is surprising that no attention has been paid to the corresponding current distributions except ref .",
    "@xcite where they only relate the average of squared current to @xmath47 . since currents may be measured @xcite it is of interest to establish a form also for currents .",
    "below we will show how to find a useful form that is both simple and universal .",
    "let us limit ourselves to the case of a weak _ net _ current between narrow input and output leads .",
    "inside the cavity , however , there will be a rich , whirling flow pattern , which is strongly influenced by the vortical motions around the nodal points associated with the complex form of the wave function .",
    "hence the net current through the through the billiard turns out to be only a tiny fraction of the total internal flow , in particular for asymmetric arrangements of leads and wave lengths that are small compared to the dimensions of the cavity . as a result",
    "the corresponding distributions may to a good approximation be chosen to be isotropic .",
    "hence the components of the current effectively average to zero .",
    "these assumptions are verified by the numerical calculations to be discussed in the next section .",

    "the absolute value of the probability current density let us consider the joint distribution function @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "since this expression is radially symmetric one can find the probability density function @xmath65 for @xmath66 by just multiplying eq .",
    "( [ jxjy ] ) with a factor of @xmath67 .",
    "this gives us the final expression @xmath68",
    "as a numerical verification of the analytic expressions for the probability current distribution , we consider an open 2d bunimovich hard - wall stadium ( see inset in fig.[t ] ) .",
    "it is characterized by the radius of a semicircle @xmath69 and the half - length of a straight section @xmath70 , and coupled to a pair of leads with a common width @xmath71 . here",
    "we choose ( @xmath72 ) and ( @xmath73 ) for which the billiard is maximally chaotic and weakly open , respectively . to find the scattering wave function for particles entering and leaving the cavity via the leads we solve the time - independent schrdinger equation for @xmath6 under dirichlet boundary conditions using a plane - wave - expansion method @xcite , which gives reflection and transmission amplitudes for a given energy .",

    "[ t ] .    for the statistical analysis of the scattering wave functions we select two typical cases : ( a ) a low energy with only one fully open channel ( @xmath77 ) for which @xmath74 reaches unity ; ( b ) a high energy with @xmath78 and an intermediate value for @xmath74 . for the statistics",
    "the spatial average is taken over the billiard region corresponding to the closed stadium . for convenience this area",

    "the transmission is , however , lower than in the previous example . as it appears from these",
    "there is no simple relation between @xmath74 and @xmath46 .",
    "we have derived the statistical distributions for wave functions , probability current densities and corresponding components for 2d open quantum systems with classically chaotic dynamics .",
    "the expressions for the probability currents are universal in the sense that the shape of the distributions is independent of the mixing parameter @xmath46 , _",
    "i.e. _ , only the width changes with @xmath46 .",
    "this is in contrast to the wave function statistics that transforms gradually from goe to gue type with increasing @xmath46 .",
