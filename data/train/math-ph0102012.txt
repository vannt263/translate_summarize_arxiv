    "it has turned out that field theories can be described best in the jet bundle formalism . for first order theories , i.e.",
    "when the lagrange density is a function of the fields and their first derivatives only , the description can be reduced to the first jet bundle .",
    "this description is an extension of the lagrangean formulation of mechanics in the following sense . in particle mechanics ,",
    "particles are described by curves in the tangent space @xmath0 , i.e. by sections of the ( trivial ) bundle @xmath1 . in field theory ,",
    "physical fields are sections of some bundle over space - time , i.e. higher dimensional curves .",
    "consequently , the base manifold of a given field theory  which quite often is space - time  _ should not be confused with the configuration space of mechanics .",
    "_ rather , the latter is represented by the fibres of the given fibre bundle when the base manifold is @xmath2 , i.e. the time axis .",
    "+ the corresponding field equations are second order but  for nicely behaving lagrange densities  can be reduced to a system of first order equations , the so - called de donder  weyl equations ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "one might view these equations as a generalisation of the usual hamilton equations in mechanics .",
    "however , a peculiar feature of this approach is that there are as many conjugate momenta corresponding to each field coordinate degree of freedom as there are space - time dimensions .",
    "+ for the study of quantum effects in field theory , at least in the sense of star products ( @xcite ) there is the need of an algebraic formulation of the theory .",
    "there has been recent progress on that , namely the gerstenhaber structure found by kanatchikov ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this article , a geometric construction of this gerstenhaber structure will be proposed that works for arbitrary fibre bundles .",
    "particular attention will be paid to the treatment of internal symmetries and to the correspondence to the standard hamiltonian formulation of field theory .",

    "in particular , both the field theoretical phase space and the section space are infinite dimensional spaces , while @xmath36 is of dimension @xmath121 .",
    "the legendre map provides a map from the section space to @xmath117 , which is explicitely given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the lagrange density and @xmath124 denotes all derivatives of the fields @xmath118 . on the field theoretical phase space there is a canonical ( weak symplectic ) @xmath125-form that can be pulled back using the tangent map of ( [ legendre ] ) .",

    "let @xmath132 be the prolongation to the vertical bundle @xmath20 of a given variational field @xmath87 .",
    "explicitely , one finds @xmath133 where we have used the christoffel symbols of @xmath129 for the map @xmath134 , ( [ def - i - gamma ] ) .",
