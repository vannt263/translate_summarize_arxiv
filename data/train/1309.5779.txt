    "the desire for understanding the mechanics of complex networks  @xcite , describing a wide range of systems in nature and society , motivated many applied and theoretical investigations of the last two decades . a motivation for our work can come from the phenomenon of viral marketing in social networks : a person after getting acquainted with an advertisement ( or a news article or a gangnam style video , for that matter ) through one of his `` friends ''",
    ", may decide to share it with some ( not necessarily all ) of his friends , who will , in turn , pass it along to some of their friends , and so on .",
    "the campaign is successful if starting from a relatively small number of initially targeted persons , the influence ( or information ) can spread as an epidemic `` infecting '' a non - negligible fraction of the population .",
    "[ [ enhanced - configuration - model ] ] enhanced configuration model + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    traditionally , social networks have been modeled as random graphs  @xcite , where the vertices denote the individuals and edges connect individuals who know one another .",
    "the configuration model is considered as a useful approximation in this matter , and we assume it for our study of the viral marketing .",
    "it is a random ( multi-)graph , whose vertices have prescribed degrees , realized by half - edges emanating from them and uniformly pair - wise matched to each other to create edges . in order to model a selective character of the influence propagation ( each vertex can be influenced by any of its neighbours but in its turn , it can only influence a subset of its neighbours ) , we enhance the original configuration model by considering _ two types of half - edges_. _ transmitter half edges _ of a given vertex represent links through which this vertex will influence ( pass the information once it has it ) to its neighbours .",
    "its _ receiver half - edges _ represent links through which this vertex will not propagate the information to its neighbours .",
    "the neighbours receive the information both through their transmitter and receiver half - edges matched to a transmitter half edge of the information sender .",
    "the two types of half - edges are not distinguished during the uniform pair - wise matching of all half - edges , but only to trace the propagation of information . assuming the usual consistency conditions for the numbers of transmitter and receiver half - edges , the enhanced configuration model is asymptotically ( when the number of vertices @xmath0 goes to infinity ) described by the vector of two , not necessarily independent , integer valued random variables , representing the _ transmitter _ and _ receiver degree _ of the typical vertex .",
    "equivalently , we can consider the _",
    "total vertex degree _ , representing the total number of friends of a person and its transmitter degree , representing the number of friends he / she is able to influence .",
    "[ [ results ] ] results + + + + + + +    we consider the advertisement campaign started from some initial target ( source vertex ) and following the aforementioned dynamic on a realization of the enhanced configuration model of the total number of vertices @xmath0 .",
    "the results are formulated with high probability ( whp ) , i.e. with probability approaching one as @xmath1 .",
    "first , we give a condition involving the total degree and the transmitter degree distributions of the enhanced configuration model , which if satisfied , would allow whp the advertisement campaign to reach a non - negligible fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the population , called a _ big ( influenced ) component _ , provided that the initial target is chosen from a set of _ good pioneers_. further in this case , we show that asymptotically the _ big component is essentially the same _ regardless of the good pioneer chosen , and we explicitly evaluate the asymptotic size of this component relative to  @xmath0 .",
    "the essential uniqueness of the big component means that the subsets of influenced vertices reached from two different good pioneers differ by at most @xmath3 vertices whp .",
    "finally , under some additional technical assumption we calculate the relative size of the set of good pioneers .",
    "[ [ methodology ] ] methodology + + + + + + + + + + +    a standard technique for the analysis of diffusion of information on the configuration model consists in simultaneous exploration of the model and the propagation of the influence .",
    "we adopt this technique and , more precisely , the approach proposed in @xcite for the study of the giant component of the ( classical ) configuration model . in this approach , instead of the branching process approximating the early stages of the graph exploration ,",
    "one uses a `` fluid limit '' analysis of the process up to the time when the exploration of the big component is completed .",
    "we tailor this method to our specific dynamic of influence propagation and calculate the relative size of the big influenced component , as well as prove its essential uniqueness .    a fundamental difference with respect to the study of the giant component of the classical model stems from the directional character of our propagation dynamic .",
    "precisely , the edges matching a transmitter and a receiver half - edge can relay the influence from the transmitter half - edge to the receiver one , but not the other way around .",
    "this means that the good pioneers do not need to belong to the big ( influenced ) component , and vice versa . in this context",
    ", we introduce a _ reverse dynamic _ , in which a message ( think of an `` acknowledgement '' ) can be sent in the reversed direction on every edge ( from an arbitrary half - edge to the receiver one ) , which traces all the possible sources of influence of a given vertex .",
    "this reversed dynamic can be studied using the same approach as the original one . in particular",
    ", one can establish the essential uniqueness of the big component of the reversed process as well as calculate its relative size .",
    "interestingly , this relative size coincides with the probability of the non - extinction of the branching process approximating the initial phase of the original exploration process , whence the hypothesis that the big component of the reverse process coincides with the set of good pioneers .",
    "we prove this conjecture under some additional ( technical ) assumption .",
    "we believe the method of introducing a reverse process to derive results for the original one has not been seen in a related context in the existing literature .",
    "[ [ related - work ] ] related work + + + + + + + + + + + +    the propagation of influence through a network has been previously studied in various contexts .",
    "the configuration model has formed the base for an increasing number of influence propagation studies , of which one relevant to the phenomenon of viral networking in social networks is discussed in @xcite and @xcite , where a vertex in the network gets influenced only if a certain proportion of its neighbours have already been influenced .",
    "this interesting propagation dynamic is further studied by introducing _",
    "cliques _ in configuration model to observe the impact of clustering on the size of the population influenced ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this dynamic is a kind of _ pull model _ where influence propagation depends on whether a vertex decides to receive the influence from its neighbours .",
    "we study a _ push model _",
    ", where the influence propagation depends on whether a vertex decides to transmit the influence .",
    "a propagation dynamic where every influenced node , at all times , keeps choosing one of its neighbours uniformly at random and transmits the message to it is studied on a @xmath4-regular graph in @xcite .",
    "this dynamic is close in its spirit to the one we considered in this paper , however the process stops when _ all _ nodes receive the message , and this stopping time is studied in the paper .",
    "the same dynamic but restricted to some ( possibly random ) maximal number of transmissions allowed for each vertex is considered in @xcite on a complete graph .",
    "this can be thought as a special case of our dynamic ( although we study it on a different underlying graph ) if we assume that the transmitter and receiver degrees correspond to the number of collected and non - collected coupons , respectively , in the classical coupon collector problem with the number of coupons being the vertex degree and the number of trials being the number of allowed transmissions . in a more applied context , a rudimentary special case of our dynamic of influence propagation",
    "has actually been studied on real - world networks like _ flixster _ and _ flickr _ ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we describe our model and formulate the results . in sections  [ s.forward ] and  [ s.reverse ]",

    "conditioning the configuration model to be simple , we obtain a uniform random graph with the given degree sequence , denoted by @xmath10 . since it is convenient to work with the configuration model , we will prove all our results for the configuration model and the corresponding results for the uniform random graph can be obtained by passing through a standard conditioning procedure ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
