    "the study of high energy behavior of field theories , in particular yang - mills theories , was very successful in the early 70 s . in the quantum chromodynamics , for example , the discovery of asymptotic freedom @xcite turned out to be one of the most important properties of yang - mills theories . on the other hand ,",
    "the hidden spontaneously broken symmetry becomes evident at high energies .",
    "it is thus very tempting to generalize this study to string theory , which certainly contains a huge hidden symmetry . in 1988 ,",
    "gross and mende @xcite proposed a saddle point method to calculate high energy @xmath0 fixed angle string scattering amplitudes .",
    "they identified a saddle point to the leading order in energy in the calculation of first quantized string scattering amplitudes for all loops in string perturbation theory .",
    "soon after , based on this remarkable calculation , gross @xcite made important conjectures on high energy stringy symmetries .",
    "there are two main conjectures of gross s pioneer work on this subject .",
    "the first one is the existence of an infinite number of linear relations among the scattering amplitudes of different string states that are valid order by order in perturbation theory at high energies .",
    "the second is that this symmetry is so powerful as to determine the scattering amplitudes of all the infinite number of string states in terms of , say , the dilaton ( tachyon for the case of open string ) scattering amplitudes .",
    "however , the symmetry charges of his proposed stringy symmetries were not understood and the proportionality constants between scattering amplitudes of different string states were not calculated . as we will see soon , all these problems can be solved by using another independent calculation based on the following key idea : _ the identification of symmetry charges from an infinite number of stringy zero - norm states with arbitrarily high spins in the ocfq spectrum_.    the importance of zero - norm states and their implication on stringy symmetries were first pointed out in the context of the massive @xmath1-model approach of string theory @xcite .",
    "zero - norm states were shown to imply _ inter - particle symmetries _ in the first order weak background field approximation which is valid to all energies .",
    "on the other hand , zero - norm states were also shown @xcite to carry the spacetime @xmath2 symmetry charges of the 2d string theory .",
    "some implications of stringy ward identities , derived from the decoupling of two types of zero - norm states , on stringy scattering amplitudes were also discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently it was discovered that @xcite the high energy limit of these stringy ward identities imply an infinite number of linear relations among scattering amplitudes of different string states with the same momenta .",
    "these linear relations can be used to fix the proportionality constants _ algebraically _ between scattering amplitudes of different string states at each fixed mass level .",
    "these proportionality constants  were found to be independent of the scattering angle @xmath3 and the loop order @xmath4 of string perturbation theory as was conjectured by gross @xcite . thus there is only one independent component of high energy stringy scattering amplitudes for each fixed mass level .",
    "for the case of string - tree amplitudes , a general formula can even be given to determine all high energy stringy scattering amplitudes for arbitrary mass levels in terms of those of tachyons @xcite - another conjecture by gross @xcite .    since the results we obtained from zero - norm states approach @xcite are more complete than those obtained via the saddle point method in the past @xcite , it would be of interest to directly compare these two independent calculations . after a brief review of zero - norm state calculation in section",
    "ii , in section iii we will use high energy limits of our stringy ward identities , which are valid to all energies and all loops , as a consistent check of saddle point calculations . since there is so far no independent rigorous check of saddle point calculation , partially due to the highly nontrivial structure of moduli spaces of general riemann surfaces ,",
    "our simple stringy ward identities serve as the best theoretical test of this saddle point approximation .",
    "_ surprisingly , some inconsistencies are found for the results of saddle point calculations even for the string - tree scattering amplitudes of the excited string states_. we discuss and calculate the missing terms of the calculation by those authors to recover the stringy ward identities . in section",
    "iv of this paper , based on the stringy ward identities , we derive a general formula of all high energy four - point string - tree amplitudes of arbitrary string states .",
    "this formula was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "here we will give a general proof and present some examples .",
    "_ this formula determines the scattering amplitudes of all the infinite number of string states in terms of tachyon scattering amplitudes_. the formula is extremely simple which manifestly demonstrates the universal high energy behavior of the interactions of an infinite number of string states .",
    "let s begin with a brief review of zero - norm state calculation @xcite . in the ocfq spectrum of open bosonic string theory , the solutions of physical state conditions include positive - norm propagating states and two types of zero - norm states .",
    "the latter are @xcite @xmath5@xmath6 while type i states have zero - norm at any spacetime dimension , type ii states have zero - norm _ only _ at d=26 . in the first quantized approach of string theory , the stringy _ on - shell _",
    "ward identities are proposed to be @xcite@xmath7 where at least one of the 4 vertex operators corresponds to the zero - norm state . in eq.(3 ) @xmath8 is the string coupling constant , @xmath9 is the volume of the group of diffeomorphisms and weyl rescalings of the worldsheet metric , and @xmath10 are the on - shell vertex operators with momenta @xmath11 .",

    "for each longitudinal @xmath41 component , the order is @xmath42 ( the naive order of @xmath43 is @xmath42 ) and for each transverse @xmath44 component , the order is @xmath29 ( the naive order of @xmath45 is @xmath29 ) @xmath46 this is due to the definitions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 in eqs ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , where @xmath49 got one energy power more than @xmath50 due to eq.(8 ) , the _ naive leading order _",
    "@xmath51 term of the energy expansion for @xmath52 is forced to be zero . as a result",
    ", the true leading order is at most @xmath53 .",
    "this is the meaning of the superscript @xmath54 in eq.(8 ) .",
    "similar rule applies to other equations .",
    "it is important to note that eqs.(8 ) - ( 11 ) are valid to all loops and are independent of the particles chosen for @xmath55 . for the case of string - tree level @xmath56 with one tensor @xmath57 and three tachyons @xmath55 , all four scattering amplitudes in eq.(11 ) were calculated to be @xmath58}^{3}$ ] , where@xmath59 is the high energy limit of @xmath60 with @xmath61 , and we have calculated it up to the next leading order in @xmath29 . this is the order which includes the energy power factor in front of the exponential .",
    "eq.(11 ) was thus explicitly justified @xcite . in eq.(15 ) @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the mandelstam variables and our convention here is different from references @xcite by interchanging @xmath65 .    in deriving eqs .",
    "( 8) - ( 10 ) , we have identified @xmath66 not only at the naive leading order but also at the true leading order in energy . for the massless case ,",
    "this is true since by definitions eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) , @xmath67 .",
    "however , for the massive case , it is not obvious that they can be identified .",
    "naively , in the high energy limit , all masses go to zero , and one expects smooth massless limits for all relevant physical quantities and @xmath68 as in the massless case .",
    "this issue is a more familiar subject in the context of field theories and it turns out that the smooth massless limit may not be achieved for an arbitrary massive field theory .",
    "for example , it is well known that the massless limit of a massive gauge field theory is in general different from the massless theory . to illustrate this point ,",
    "consider a massive gauge field with the lagrangian density @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a current coupled to @xmath71 and @xmath72 represents the kinetic term and possible interaction terms for @xmath70 .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath71 is solved in momentum space as @xmath73 immediately we see that the massless limit is discontinuous since the second term on the right blows up when @xmath74 .",
    "fronsdal @xcite showed that , for vector gauge potentials as well as gauge fields of higher spins , the requirement of the continuity of the massless limit is equivalent to the conservation of charge associated with the gauge symmetry .",
    "the second term in eq.(17 ) vanishes if we assume charge conservation @xmath75 .",
    "note that the assumption of charge conservation also leads to ward identities @xmath76 , which are certainly nontrivial relations among correlation functions .    for the cases of our stringy massive states",
    ", we do have these stringy gauge symmetries or conserved charges to fulfil fronsdal s criterion . therefore , although naively zero - norm states can not by themselves establish nontrivial relations among scattering amplitudes , our assumption about the continuity of the high energy limit , which is implicitly imposed when we identify @xmath77 , leads to nontrivial relations , namely our stringy ward identities . in our prescription ,",
    "zero - norm state is a vehicle used to bring the information about charge conservation to the surface to be seen .",
    "as we found explicitly for mass levels @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite , our prescription indeed leads to ratios between scattering amplitudes for different particles .",
    "we give one example here to justify our assumption @xmath80 .",
    "we have explicitly checked that@xmath81 to the leading order in energy , for the case of string tree amplitudes with spin - three tensor @xmath57 and three tachyons @xmath55 .",
    "we now briefly review the saddle point calculation of eq.(3 ) @xcite .",
    "first one notes that the high energy limit @xmath0 is equivalent to the semi - classical limit of first - quantized string theory . in this limit ,",
    "the closed string @xmath82-loop scattering amplitudes is dominated by a saddle point in the moduli space @xmath12 . for the oriented open string amplitudes",
    ", the saddle point configuration can be constructed from an associated configuration of the closed string via reflection principle .",
    "it was also found that the euler number @xmath4 of the oriented open string saddle is always @xmath83 , where @xmath82 is the genus of the associated closed string saddle .",
    "thus the integral in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is dominated in the @xmath0 limit by an associated @xmath82-loop closed string saddle point in @xmath84,@xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the closed string classical trajectory at @xmath82-loop order was found , according to gross and mende @xcite , to behave at the saddle point as@xmath87 which leads to the @xmath4-th order open string four - tachyon amplitude@xmath88 eq.(20 ) reproduces the very soft exponential decay e@xmath89 of the well - known string - tree @xmath4=1 amplitude .",
    "there is a consistent check of eq.(20 ) at small angles , where the genus-@xmath82 scattering process can be decomposed into @xmath90 successive scatterings @xcite .",
    "the exponent of eq.(20 ) can be thought of as the electrostatic energy @xmath91 of two - dimensional minkowski charges @xmath11 placed at @xmath92 on a riemann surface of genus @xmath82 .",
    "one can use the @xmath93 invariance of the saddle to fix 3 of the 4 points @xmath92 , then the only modulus is the cross ratio @xmath94 , which takes the value@xmath95 to extremize @xmath91 if we neglect the mass of the tachyons in the high energy limit . for excited string states , it was found that only polarizations in the plane of scattering will contribute to the amplitude at high energies . to the leading order in energy @xmath29 ,",
    "the products of e@xmath96 and e@xmath97 with @xmath98 at string - tree level @xmath56 ( or @xmath99 ) were calculated by using eq.(19 ) to be @xcite@xmath100@xmath101@xmath102 where @xmath103 is the mass of the particle .",
    "we are now ready to use the results of our zero - norm state calculation , eqs.(8 ) - ( 11 ) , to check the validity of the saddle point calculations eqs.(21 ) - ( 24 ) .",
    "note that eqs.(8 ) - ( 11 ) are the high energy limit of the decoupling of zero - norm states of stringy scattering amplitudes .",
    "they are directly related to the unitarity of string theory .",
    "we will just check the string - tree amplitudes since only in this case the exact results are known .",
    "let s use eqs.(21)-(24 ) to calculate , for example , the high energy limit of eq.(4 ) where both scattering amplitudes @xmath104 @xmath105 are defined by eq.(3 ) .",
    "it is easy to see , according to eqs.(21 ) - ( 24 ) , that the kinematic factor @xmath106 of @xmath52 is of energy order @xmath29 while @xmath107 .",
    "this means that @xmath108 @xcite to the leading order in the saddle point calculation .",
    "this obviously violates the result of our zero - norm state calculation eq.(8 ) , which says @xmath109 and @xmath110 are of the same energy order @xmath53 . since eq.(8 ) is the high energy limit of eq.(4 ) .",
    "we conclude that there is an inconsistency between eq.(4 ) and eq.(21)-(24 ) . in other words , _",
    "the results eqs.(21)-(24 ) violates the high energy massive gauge invariance @xcite of eq.(8 ) and thus will threat the unitarity of string interactions .",
    "_ many similar examples with the same inconsistencies exist at higher mass levels mainly due to the wrong result of eq.(24 ) .",
    "they are scattering processes with vertices containing @xmath111 , or processes whose naive leading order in energy vanishes , e.g.@xmath112 .    to further demonstrate why the previous saddle point calculations @xcite fail to be consistent with the stringy ward identity , we redo the calculations based on the saddle point method and figure out the missing terms in the previous results . again , we shall use the examples of @xmath78 amplitudes @xmath52 and @xmath113 to demonstrate the correct calculation .",

    "for instance , the integral of eqs.(28 ) and ( 29 ) can be defined as @xmath121}\\nonumber\\\\ &   = \\int_{0}^{1}dx\\hspace{0.3cm}u_{-1,2}(x)\\exp^{-\\frac{s}{2}f(x ) } , \\tag{30}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath122 the other integrals in eqs.(26 ) and ( 27 ) , @xmath123 and @xmath124 can be similarily defined .",
    "note that our definitions of mandelstam variables here are different from eqs .",
    "( 21)- ( 24 ) by interchanging @xmath125 now , before doing saddle point calculations , we would like to point out that there are two different definitions of the concepts of saddle - points .",
    "for the integral of eq.(30 ) , for example , the first definition is the saddle point @xmath126 which leads to @xmath127 and is given by @xmath128 , and we have @xmath129 . in this case , the saddle point is independent of the prefactor @xmath130 the more standard definition of saddle point is , however , the value @xmath131 which extremizes the exponent of @xmath132 in this case , the saddle points of the integrals of the scattering amplitudes of the excited string states will be shifted level by level .",
    "we stress that although this shift is of subleading order in energy compared with eq.(20 ) , its effect will bring down an energy power factor in front of the exponential .",
    "these power factors are crucial to recover the stringy ward identities and get the linear relations among high energy scattering amplitudes conjectured by gross . in the following",
    ", we will adopt the first definition to do the calculation .",
    "however , both saddle point calculations should give the same results if one does the calculations carefully .",

    "after some calculations , we find @xmath147 , so the second term in the @xmath148 corrections of eq.(35 ) sum up to zero .",
    "the only surviving contribution comes from the first term in the @xmath149 corrections in eq.(35 ) , and we have @xmath150   _ { x_{0}}% = \\frac{(1-\\tau)^{2}}{\\tau}.\\tag{38}%\\ ] ] we emphasize that these are exactly the missing terms of the previous saddle point calculations @xcite . once these corrections are taken into account @xcite , we are able to obtain the result which is consistent with our stringy ward identities .",

    "it is worth noting that if all stringy propagating modes contribute at least one high energy scattering amplitude , then eq.(43 ) applies to all particles in the string spectrum .",
