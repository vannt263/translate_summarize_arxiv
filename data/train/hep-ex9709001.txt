    "it is a well established principle that weak interactions violate parity .",

    "the study of observables related to the spin of the final state fermions provides an accurate determination of the vector and axial  vector coupling of the fermions to the z boson . only in the @xmath8 processes ,",
    "where both taus decay before entering the detector , we can extract information on the final state spin configuration by analysing the @xmath0 decay process itself .",
    "the cross section describing the @xmath8 process can be written in terms of the final state taus spin components as follows  @xcite : @xmath9    where @xmath10 contains the z propagator and @xmath11 is the @xmath12 polar angle with respect to the incident @xmath13 flight direction .",
    "@xmath14 is the ( longitudinal ) projection of the spin of the @xmath0 along its flight direction in the lab frame , @xmath15 the ( transverse ) projection in the plane defined by the incoming @xmath13 and the outgoing @xmath12 and @xmath16 the component normal to these two .    the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 )",
    "depend on the couplings of the z to the leptons ( @xmath20 ) . in the following sections we will exploit the symmetries of the cross section in order to define quantities ( in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) related to the @xmath0 spin which can be measured accurately at lep : these are the @xmath0 longitudinal polarisation ( @xmath1 ) and the transverse  transverse ( @xmath2 ) and transverse ",

    "the energy spectrum observed for a given @xmath0 decay process ( @xmath31 ) can be expressed in terms of two contributions , from left and right  handed taus respectively :    @xmath32    being @xmath33 , the energy of the decay product normalised to the @xmath0 energy . by simple spin arguments equation  ( [ dndx ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath34    the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are different for every @xmath0 decay channel and depend mainly on the particle energy , mass and spin  @xcite . a graphical representation of equation  ( [ ndndx ] ) , for the two extreme values of @xmath1 ( @xmath37 ) ,",

    "the sensitivity to @xmath1 for a given channel depends on the relative shape of @xmath35 and @xmath36 and is maximal for the @xmath38 channel ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) . in the case of multi ",

    "different experiments  @xcite use different approaches to the problem .",
    "the @xmath0 longitudinal polarisation ( @xmath1 ) value is extracted , for a given @xmath44 range , by performing a fit of the distribution  ( [ ndndx ] ) to the data , once the detector and selection effects have been properly included in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 functions ( by using monte carlo simulation and/or analytical techniques  @xcite ) .",
    "the data spectra ( opal  @xcite ) obtained in the whole @xmath44 range of the detector for the e , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 channels are shown in figure  [ fig : opal ] , together with the fit result .",

    "the @xmath8 processes are characterised for being low multiplicity events , with different particle signatures in opposite hemispheres ( in most of cases ) .",
    "in addition , the invariant mass of the event is well below the z mass , due to the presence of undetected neutrinos .",
    "the main background to this process is coming from @xmath51 and @xmath52 with misidentified particles in the final state , as well as from two photon events .",
    "the experiments at lep are well suited for identifying individual @xmath0 decay channels by considering the tracking chambers information , showers from the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters and the information from the muon chambers .",
    "in general the identification efficiencies are high , except for multi  pion final states in which @xmath53 identification plays a crucial role . as a consequence ,",
