    "the question of whether quantum mechanics applies at the mesoscopic or macroscopic levels has generated an enormous amount of work in recent years .",
    "as emphasised by leggett @xcite , theoretical discussions of this topic should include realistic physical models , with the ultimate goal of testing the predictions of quantum mechanics against experimental results .",
    "in particular , it is crucial to include all couplings between the quantum systems and their environment ( which according to quantum theory , is itself also quantum - mechanical ) .    in this context",
    ", it is surprising that no discussion of a quantum measurement operation ever considered both system and apparatus , both coupled to some external environment , with all three described in a fully quantum mechanical way .",
    "apart from the practical interest of such a discussion ( see below ) , it is also essential if one is to examine the cornerstone of the copenhagen interpretation , viz .",
    ", that quantum states can only be defined with reference to some measuring system .",
    "we consider here a fully quantum - mechanical description of a measurement scheme using systems that have already shown evidence of macroscopic quantum behaviour , ie . ,",
    "squids and nanomagnets .",
    "the low - energy dynamics can be reduced to the `` pisces '' model , the dynamics of which was recently elucidated @xcite .",
    "a quantum measurement typically involves some `` measuring coordinate '' ( usually macroscopic ) , and a quantum system which is being measured . both are coupled to their environment .",
    "the simplest example is where the quantum `` system '' is stable in one of 2 interesting quantum states , and the apparatus likewise . in this case",
    "the apparatus works as a measuring device if its final state is correlated with the initial state of the system .",
    "one common such model , the `` bell / coleman - hepp '' model @xcite , has hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a pauli vector describing the apparatus , and @xmath2 a pauli vector for the system .",
    "the coupling @xmath3 , so that if @xmath2 is in initial state @xmath4 , then @xmath1 is unaffected , whereas if @xmath2 is initially @xmath5 , then @xmath6 flips ( with no change in @xmath2 ) .",
    "we thus have the classic `` ideal measurement '' scheme , for which @xmath7 ie .",
    ", the final state of the apparatus is uniquely correlated with the initial state of the system .",
    "such a scheme can in principle be obtained starting with a large variety of initial `` microscopic '' high - energy hamiltonians .",
    "consider , eg .",
    ", a hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the `` coordinate '' of the apparatus and system respectively , @xmath11 and @xmath12 describe symmetric 2-well systems ( with minima at @xmath13 ) and the coupling @xmath14 is produced by expanding the interaction in powers of @xmath9 and @xmath15 .",
    "a `` bias field '' @xmath16 also acts on the apparatus .",
    "the environment is composed of delocalised harmonic oscillators @xmath17 modes , with linear coupling to the macroscopic systems .    below a `` uv cut - off '' energy @xmath18",
    ", only the 2 lowest levels of each system will be important ; thus if @xmath19 , it is straightforward to truncate eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) to the low - energy hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the same as in eq . ( [ 3 ] ) ( with @xmath9 and @xmath15 replaced by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and with the restriction that all @xmath25 ) ; and @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are calculable tunneling matrix elements and @xmath29 is a renormalised interaction , produced by integrating out high energy environmental modes ( @xmath30 )    we refer to hamiltonians like ( [ htotal ] ) as pisces hamiltonians ( pisces being an acronym for `` pair or interacting spins coupled to an environmental sea '' ) .",
    "we have recently solved the dynamics of this model @xcite . here",
    "we shall ( a ) describe under what conditions it behaves like the ideal measuring scheme ( [ 2 ] ) , and ( b ) discuss how microscopic theory for squids or nanomagnets , operating in the quantum regime , shows they are described by ( [ htotal ] ) .",
    "this then allows us to see how one may experimentally probe the quantum measurement operation .",
    "consider as an example 2 conducting nanomagnets imbedded in a metallic matrix- they interact via dipolar interactions and also via the conduction electron bath .",
    "for this problem ( of great importance in disordered magnets , metallic glasses , and `` colossal magnetoresistance '' systems ) , the interaction with nuclear spins is not important ( unlike for insulating nanomagnets ! ) . in the quantum regime",
    ", each nanomagnet behaves @xcite like a `` spin - boson '' system @xcite , with an ohmic coupling to the bath of dimensionless strength @xmath31 , where @xmath32 labels each nanomagnet , @xmath33 is the dimensionless exchange coupling at each electronic spin site in the nanomagnet , and @xmath34 is the spin quantum number of the `` giant spin '' produced when the electronic spins lock together at low @xmath35 . since typically @xmath36 for metals , we get very strong coupling ( @xmath37 ) , even for very small metallic nanomagnets ; however one can also vary @xmath38 , going even to semimetals , to produce very small @xmath39 . in isolation , if @xmath37 , these `` giant kondo '' spins are frozen by the electron bath until either @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the bias in an external field along the easy axis , and @xmath18 is roughly the single ion anisotropy ( @xmath42 ) , and independent of @xmath34 .",
    "truncation of the pair of nanomagnets to the quantum regime produces a pisces hamiltonian like eq .",
    "( [ htotal ] ) , with a renormalised interaction @xmath43 \\tau^z \\sigma^z$ ] , where @xmath44 is the radius vector between the nanomagnet centres , and @xmath45 is the dipolar interaction ; transverse spin - spin couplings are irrelevant .",
    "the electron - mediated interaction @xmath46 depends on the shape and surface properties of each nanomagnet ( for analytic calculations see @xcite ) , but quite generally @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fermi energy ( ie . , the bandwidth , in this simple calculation ) , and @xmath49 the fermi wave - vector .    as a quite different example",
    "consider 2 interacting squids .",
    "the results are intuitively obvious ; we get a pisces model , with coupling described by a mutual inductance and capacitance , and possibly a dissipative coupling through the circuitry ( depending on the experimental set - up ) ; we give details elsewhere .",
    "one can also consider a squid ring coupled to a nanomagnet , with one or other behaving as a measuring device .",
    "let us briefly review the dynamics @xcite of the pisces model- controlled by the direct interaction @xmath29 , the temperature @xmath35 , two renormalised tunneling matrix elements @xmath50 , and 3 dissipative couplings , which we will assume here to be ohmic , with values @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "there are 4 main dynamical regimes ( as shown in fig .",
    "( 1 ) for the symmetric case @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ) , viz :    \\(i ) the `` locked phase '' ( @xmath55 ) : the 2 spins lock together , in either ferro- or antiferromagnetic states depending on the sign of @xmath29 , and behave like a single spin - boson system , with tunneling matrix element @xmath56 and coupling @xmath57 to the oscillator bath .",
    "\\(ii ) the `` mutual coherence '' phase ( @xmath58 ; @xmath59 ) : the thermal energy @xmath60 , but if the dissipative couplings @xmath51 s are small ( @xmath61 ) , the energy scale @xmath62 can dominate even if @xmath63 .",
    "the 2 systems are then in a superposition of quantum states , and the dynamics is composed of damped `` beat''-like oscillations , at 3 different frequencies .",
    "\\(iii ) the `` correlated relaxation '' or high - t phase ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "each spin relaxes incoherently , but in the time - dependent bias generated by the other- there are 3 characteristic relaxation times .",
    "these oscillations simply reflect the fact that the system is in a superposition of quantum states .",
    "\\(iv ) the rather boring `` perturbative regime '' ( @xmath65 ) , in which the total coupling only weakly affects the single spin - boson behaviour    an important feature of the pisces model is that as soon as @xmath59 , the single spin - boson model results @xcite are invalid , and decoherence effects are massively amplified .",
    "coherent oscillations can only exist in the mutual coherence regime .",
    "we assume our 2 systems are coupled by a renormalised `` ferromagnetic '' interaction @xmath66 and also that ( i ) @xmath67 and ( ii ) @xmath68 .",
    "requirement ( i ) means the apparatus reacts quickly to any change in the system state .",
    "requirement ( ii ) means that the bias @xmath16 holds the apparatus in state @xmath69 when there is no coupling ; when @xmath29 acts , it must overcome this bias .",
    "the resulting net bias between initial and final states of the apparatus must be @xmath70 , so that apparatus transitions are irreversible .",
    "we immediately see that this system will behave according to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the combined system - apparatus starts off either in @xmath71 ( and stays there ) or in @xmath72 ( and then tunnels inelastically to @xmath73 ) .",
    "typically the apparatus - bath coupling is strong , so the apparatus relaxes quickly .",
    "notice that the quantum dynamics of the _ system _ is _ frozen _ as soon as the apparatus - system coupling is switched on , since @xmath74 the measurement suppresses the quantum dynamics of the measured system .",
    "this is a general feature of quantum measurements .",
    "notice also the _ dissipative _ effect of the remaining oscillators ( with @xmath75 ) on the system is quite different once @xmath29 is switched on  dissipative effects are stronger when a system is biased .",
    "however the most interesting result comes from the mutual coherence regime- if accessible ( eg .",
    ", by varying @xmath76 ) , we can set up a situation where quantum interference _ between system and apparatus _ can mess up the usual `` classical '' behaviour of the apparatus .",
    "in such a situation , all the concepts of measurement theory , based on a classical apparatus , would be incorrect .",
    "this result , if seen experimentally , would be intriguing at the very least ( as well as further testing quantum mechanics at the macroscopic scale )",
    ".    thus models of this kind , including apparatus _ and _ system ( as well as the environment ) , have interesting light to shed on measurement theory .",
    "the pisces model appears to be the first attempt to discuss all 3 partners in the measurement operation on an equal and fully quantum - mechanical level ."
