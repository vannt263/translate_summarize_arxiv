    "the production of particles with high transverse momenta from the collisions of hadrons and nuclei at high energies has relevance to constituent interactions at small scales .",
    "one of the leading principles governing these interactions is self - similarity .",
    "this principle reflects hadron structure at different scales , interaction of hadron constituents and processes of fragmentation into colorless particles .",
    "strange particles as well as other probes ( direct photons , jets , lepton pairs ) play an important role to study fundamental features of the produced matter in hadron and nuclear interactions and provide information about its transition into observed particles .",
    "the scaling behavior of particle production related to self - similarity of hadron interactions at constituent level is manifested by the @xmath3-scaling @xcite .",
    "the concept of this scaling was used for analysis of inclusive spectra obtained at the accelerators u70 , @xmath4 , sps , isr , tevatron and rhic @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the experimental spectra reveal striking similarity over a wide range of kinematic variables when expressed by the variable @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath3-scaling is treated as a manifestation of the self - similarity of the structure of the colliding objects , interaction mechanism of their constituents , and processes of fragmentation into real hadrons .",
    "the approach can be a suitable tool to search for phase transitions and the critical point in hadron and nuclear matter .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath3-scaling , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , have physical interpretation as the heat capacity of the produced matter , the fractal dimension of the structure of hadrons or nuclei and the fractal dimension of the fragmentation process , respectively .",
    "universality of the scaling is given by its flavour independence .",
    "it means that spectra of particles with different flavour content can be described by a universal function @xmath7 when using the scale transformation @xmath8 , @xmath9 .    in this contribution",
    "we illustrate properties of the @xmath3-presentation of the transverse momentum distributions of strange particles produced in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "we present results of new analysis of data on inclusive cross sections obtained by the star and phenix collaborations at rhic .",
    "the dependence of the momentum fractions and recoil mass on the collision energy , transverse momentum and mass of the inclusive particle is used to estimate the constituent energy loss .",
    "the @xmath3-scaling has been suggested to express general regularities found in the inclusive hadron production in high energy proton-(anti)proton and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "it manifests itself in the fact that the inclusive spectra of various types of particles can be described with a universal scaling function .",
    "the function @xmath7 depends on a single variable @xmath3 in a wide range of the transverse momentum , registration angles , collision energies and centralities .",
    "the scaling variable is expressed by the formula : @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are functions of kinematic variables : @xmath13 @xmath14 the variable @xmath3 is proportional to the transverse kinetic energy of the selected binary constituent sub - process required for production of the inclusive particle with mass @xmath15 and its partner ( antiparticle ) .",
    "the multiplicity density @xmath16 of charged particles in the central region , the nucleon mass @xmath17 and the parameter @xmath18 completely determine the dimensionless quantity @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 has meaning of the `` specific heat '' of the medium produced in the collisions .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is proportional to the relative number of the constituent configurations which include the binary sub - processes corresponding to the momentum fractions @xmath20 and @xmath21 of colliding hadrons ( nuclei ) and to the momentum fractions @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the secondary objects produced in these sub - processes .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are fractal dimensions of the colliding objects , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 stand for the fractal dimensions of the fragmentation process in the scattered and recoil direction , respectively . for unpolarized processes we assume the later to have the same value @xmath28 which depends on the type of the inclusive particle .",
    "the selected binary sub - process , which results in production of the inclusive particle and its recoil partner ( antiparticle ) , is defined by the maximum of @xmath29 with the kinematic constraint @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the mass of the recoil system in the sub - process .",
    "the 4-momenta of the colliding objects and the inclusive particle are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the microscopic scenario of constituent interactions developed in the framework of @xmath3-scaling is based on dependencies of the momentum fractions on the collision energy , transverse momentum and centrality .",
    "the scaling variable @xmath3 has property of a fractal measure .",
    "it grows in a power - like manner with the increasing resolution @xmath34 defined with respect to the constituent sub - processes which satisfy ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "the scaling function @xmath7 is expressed in terms of the inclusive cross section @xmath35 , multiplicity density @xmath36 , and total inelastic cross section @xmath37 .",
    "all these quantities are measurable for the inclusive reaction @xmath38 .",
    "the function @xmath7 is determined by the expression : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is jacobian of the transformation from the variables @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath7 is normalized as follows : @xmath43 equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) allows us to interpret @xmath7 as probability density of the production of the inclusive particle with the corresponding value of the variable @xmath3 .",
    "the self - similarity of production of different hadron species in @xmath1 collisions provides the basis for analysing scaling properties of the hadron spectra for more complicated systems .",
    "the hadrons with strange quarks constitute a special interest as they are the lightest particles with quantum numbers which are absent in the net amount in the initial state .",

    "the symbols representing data on differential cross sections include baryons which consist of one , two and three strange valence quarks .",
    "the open circles and diamonds correspond to the respective spectra of @xmath46 and @xmath47 mesons measured by the star collaboration @xcite .",

    "the spectra of strange baryon resonances @xmath54 ( full triangles up ) and @xmath55 ( full triangles down ) were taken from @xcite .",
    "the solid line represents the scaling curve obtained from analysis of pion production in @xmath56 collisions ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) over a wide range of kinematic variables .",
    "the curve is consistent with the energy , angular and multiplicity independence of the scaling function for different hadrons .",
    "one can see that the corresponding fragmentation dimension @xmath59 for strange mesons is larger than for pions , suggesting larger energy loss by production of mesons with strangeness content .",
    "the fragmentation dimension for strange baryons grows with the number of the strange valence quarks .",
    "this is connected with the increase of energy losses .",
    "the @xmath60-dependence of the energy loss by production of strange hadrons is shown in fig.1(b ) . the relative energy loss @xmath61 depends on value of the fragmentation dimension @xmath62 . as one can see",
    ", the relative energy loss decreases with increasing transverse momentum for all particles . for particles with",
    "a given @xmath63 gev / c , the energy loss is larger for strange baryons than for strange mesons .",
    "the growth indicates increasing tendency with larger number of strange valence quarks inside the strange baryon .",
    "such a tendency corresponds to the @xmath3-scaling universality ( fig.1(a ) ) for hadron production including strange mesons and baryons .",

    "the fraction @xmath66 characterizes amount of energy ( momentum ) of the incoming proton carried by the interacting constituent which underlies production of the inclusive particle with momentum @xmath60 .",
    "one can see that , for given strangeness and @xmath67 , the value of @xmath20 increases with the mass of the strange meson .",
