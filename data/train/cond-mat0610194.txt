    "the ongoing technological progress in the fabrication and control of nanoscale electronic circuits , such as quantum dots , has stimulated detailed studies of various quantum - impurity models , where a few local degrees of freedom are coupled to a continuum .",
    "of particular interest are models with experimentally verifiable universal properties .",
    "one of the best studied examples is the anderson single impurity model ,  @xcite which describes successfully electronic correlations in small quantum dots  @xcite . the experimental control of most of the parameters of this model , e.g. , the impurity energy level position or the level broadening due to hybridization with the continuum , allows for detailed investigations  @xcite of the universal low - temperature behavior of the anderson model .",
    "in this paper we study the low - energy behavior of a generic model , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : models]a , which pertains either to a single two - level quantum dot or to a double quantum dot where each dot harbors only a single level .",
    "the spin degeneracy of the electrons is assumed to be lifted by an external magnetic field .",
    "several variants of this model have been studied intensely in recent years , in conjunction with a plethora of phenomena , such as many - body resonances in the spectral density ,  @xcite phase lapses in the transmission phase ,  @xcite charge oscillations ,  @xcite and correlation - induced resonances in the conductance  @xcite .",
    "albeit being described by the same model , no clear linkage has been established between these seemingly different effects .",
    "the reason is in part due to the large number of model parameters involved , which so far obscured a clear physical picture .",
    "while some exact statements can be made , these are restricted to certain solvable limits ,  @xcite and are apparently nongeneric  @xcite . here",
    "we construct a framework which encompasses all parameter regimes of the model , and enables a unified description of the various phenomena alluded to above , exposing their common physical origin .",
    "for the most interesting regime of strong fluctuations between the two levels , we are able to give : ( i ) explicit analytical conditions for the occurrence of transmission phase lapses ; ( ii ) an explanation of the population inversion and the charge oscillations  @xcite ( including a kondo enhancement of the latter ) ; ( iii ) a complete account of the correlation - induced resonances  @xcite as a disguised kondo phenomenon .    after introducing the details of the double - dot hamiltonian in sec .",

    "the electrons acquire a pseudo - spin degree of freedom which is conserved upon tunnelling between the dot and the continuum , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : models]b .",
    "concomitantly , the transformation generates a local zeeman magnetic field . in this way the original double - dot model system is transformed into a generalized anderson impurity model in the presence of a (",

    "we confine ourselves to the local moment regime , in which there is a single electron on the impurity .",
    "the fluctuations of the pseudo - spin degree of freedom ( which translate into charge fluctuations between the two localized levels in the original model ) are determined by two competing effects : the polarizing effect of the local magnetic field , and the kondo screening by the itinerant electrons . in order to quantitatively analyze this competition",
    ", we derive an effective low - energy kondo hamiltonian , using haldane s scaling procedure ,  @xcite together with the schrieffer - wolff  @xcite transformation and anderson s poor man s scaling  @xcite .",
    "this portion of the derivation resembles recent studies of the kondo effect in the presence of ferromagnetic leads ,  @xcite although the physical context and implications are quite different .    as is mentioned above , the tunnelling between the impurity and the continuum in the generalized anderson model is ( pseudo ) spin dependent .",
    "this asymmetry results in two important effects : ( a ) different renormalizations of the two local levels , which in turn generates an additional local magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "this field is not necessarily aligned with the original zeeman field that is present in the generalized anderson model .",
    "( b ) an anisotropy of the exchange coupling between the conduction electrons and the local moment in the kondo hamiltonian .",
    "however , since the scaling equations for the anisotropic kondo model  @xcite imply a flow towards the _ isotropic _ strong coupling fixed point , the low - energy behavior of the generalized anderson model can be still described in terms of two competing energy scales , the kondo temperature , @xmath1 , and the renormalized magnetic field , @xmath2 .",
    "our two - stage mapping , double - dot @xmath3 generalized anderson model @xmath3 anisotropic kondo model ( see fig .",

    "this solution also results in a highly accurate expression for the conductance based upon the friedel - langreth sum rule  @xcite .",
    "perhaps most importantly , it provides a single coherent picture for the host of phenomena to which our model has been applied .",
    "examples of explicit results stemming from our general analysis are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "first , we consider the case in which the tunnelling is isotropic , being the same for spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "then the model is exactly solvable by direct application of the bethe _ ansatz _ to the anderson hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "we solve the resulting equations  @xcite numerically and obtain the occupation numbers for arbitrary parameter values of the model , and in particular , for arbitrary values of the local zeeman field . by comparing with the occupation numbers obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : observables ] from the kondo version of the model , we are able to test the accuracy of the schrieffer - wolff mapping onto the kondo hamiltonian . we find that this mapping yields extremely precise results over the entire local - moment regime .",

    "it clearly demonstrates the competition between the kondo screening of the local spin , which is governed by @xmath4 , and the polarizing effect of the local field @xmath2 .",

    "we derive analytical expressions for the occupation numbers and the conductance employing the mapping onto the kondo hamiltonian .",
