    "superstatistical techniques as introduced in @xcite can be applied to large classes of nonequilibrium systems .",
    "the crucial assumption of this approach is that the dynamics of the system under study is a superposition of two dynamics with well separated time scales .",
    "the standard example is a brownian particle moving through a slowly fluctuating environment ( e.g. there is a slowly fluctuating temperature @xmath1 ) .",
    "the fast dynamics is then determined by the change of the velocity of the brownian particle and the slow dynamics is determined by the change of the temperature of the environment .",
    "it is well known that the stationary velocity distribution of a brownian particle in a constant environment is a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath1 .",
    "the theory of superstatistics applies when the slow dynamics is so slow that the velocity distribution of the particle has time to relax to a gaussian distribution between the changes of the environment .",
    "as such , after a long time , the stationary velocity distribution of the particle is just a superposition of gaussian distributions weighted with a function @xmath2 .",
    "this @xmath2 is the probability density to observe some value of @xmath0 .",
    "depending on @xmath2 , different results for the stationary velocity distribution will occur .",
    "an important question is which types of distributions will occur in typical complex systems . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors give some probabilistic arguments in favor of three distributions , the lognormal distribution , the gamma distribution and the inverse gamma distribution .",
    "one can also derive these distributions from a maximum entropy principle @xcite .",
    "the present paper will focus on techniques to extract the distribution @xmath2 and the relevant superstatistical parameters out of real experimental data .",
    "recent applications of superstatistical methods include hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , pattern forming systems @xcite , cosmic rays @xcite , solar flares @xcite , share - price fluctuations @xcite , random matrix theory @xcite , random networks @xcite , multiplicative - noise stochastic processes @xcite , wind velocity fluctuations @xcite , hydro - climatic fluctuations @xcite , the statistics of waiting times @xcite and models of the metastatic cascade in cancerous systems @xcite .",
    "for the present paper , we will concentrate on time series as generated by hydrodynamic turbulence and share - price fluctuations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section we fix our notation . in section [ section_log_ori ]",
    "we discuss the techniques proposed in @xcite to extract superstatistical parameters out of a given time series .",
    "we propose a modification to this method in section [ mod_zelf ] . in section [ section_ex ]",
    "we test our method using surrogate data sets and show that our modification improves on the previously proposed method @xcite . in sections",
    "[ section_dist_fb ] and [ sect_eco ] we apply the superstatistical approach to real experimental data from hydrodynamic turbulence and finance . an alternative procedure to study superstatistical time series",
    "is briefly examined in section [ alt_rul ] .",
    "the final section contains a discussion of our results .",
    "the starting point is a given discrete time series @xmath3 containing @xmath4 data points .",
    "the different data points are denoted as @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "the probability distribution of the random variable @xmath3 , extracted from the experimental data , is denoted as @xmath7 .",
    "the total time series is divided into @xmath8 equal slices of length @xmath9 , with @xmath10 where @xmath11 means rounding the value of @xmath12 to the nearest lower integer .",
    "this implies that the @xmath13th time slice contains the measurement points @xmath5 with @xmath14 .",
    "we then define local moments of order @xmath15 as follows @xmath16 in the following , we will assume that the first momentum of the total time series @xmath3 @xmath17 is equal to @xmath18 .",
    "if this is not the case we use the time series @xmath19 instead of @xmath3 itself .",
    "now we want to analyse the distribution @xmath7 using superstatistics .",
    "we assume that the time series @xmath3 contains two different time scales @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22",
    ". remember that we divided the time series @xmath3 in different time slices of length @xmath9 .",
    "the time scale @xmath20 determines how fast local equilibrium is reached in these different slices .",
    "the time scale @xmath21 is the length of the slices . for every time slice",
    ", one can extract a local probability distribution for the variables @xmath5 with @xmath14 and @xmath23 . when @xmath22 , it is a good approximation to assume that local equilibrium is reached in a slice of length @xmath21 . by this",
    "we mean that the local distributions can be approximated by gaussian distributions @xmath24 with @xmath25 . within this assumption , the distribution @xmath7 is approximated by @xmath26 with @xmath27 . in this way , one obtains @xmath8 values for @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath8 is large enough , one can replace expression ( [ hu_1 ] ) by @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the probability density that the value of the inverse variance in a randomly chosen time slice of length @xmath21 equals @xmath0 .",
    "the obtained distribution @xmath30 depends on the long time scale @xmath21 , because @xmath21 determines the length of the time slices and as such the obtained values for the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the proper definition of @xmath21 is of crucial importance and a major part of the present paper will focus on this issue .    in @xcite ,",
    "a method was introduced to extract @xmath30 out of a given experimental time series .",
    "the authors proposed to check the validity of their approach a posteriori by comparing the resulting distribution @xmath31 , with the distribution @xmath7 extracted from the experimental data .",
    "notice that the superstatistical approach includes two approximations . in the first step ,",
    "one assumes the existence of two time scales @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that in every time slice local equilibrium is reached . in the second step",
    "one assumes the existence of a distribution @xmath30 replacing the summation in expression ( [ hu_1 ] ) by an integral .",
    "one would like to judge the validity of the first approximation before moving on to the second approximation .",
    "therefore , we propose an extension of the method introduced in @xcite to examine the quality of the first approximation . afterwards , the validity of the second approximation can be checked by comparing the distributions @xmath32 and @xmath31 . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the two steps of the superstatistical approach separately .",
    "we will test our arguments with surrogate data and with real experimental data sets .",
    "the correlation function of a time series @xmath3 can be calculated as follows @xmath33 the superstatistical short time scale @xmath20 of the time series is defined by the exponential decay of @xmath34 @xcite @xmath35 in @xcite a function @xmath36 is introduced as @xmath37 notice that @xmath38 is just the kurtosis of the @xmath13th time slice .",
    "the superstatistical long time scale @xmath21 is then defined by the condition @xmath39 to understand the meaning of this definition , remember that the main assumption of superstatistics is the existence of two well separated time scales .",
    "when this is true , one can approximate the distribution of the variables in the @xmath13th time slice by a gaussian distribution ( in this paper we always assume that local equilibrium is associated with gaussian behavior ) .",
    "when the variables are indeed locally gaussian distributed with zero mean and variance @xmath40 , the first four local moments and @xmath38 are simply @xmath41 the condition ( [ def_lon ] ) implies that one is looking for a suitable division of the total data set into time slices for which the variables are locally gaussian distributed @xcite , with a variance that fluctuates from slice to slice .",
    "this definition will always result in a value for the long time scale whenever the kurtosis of the complete time series @xmath42 is larger than @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by considering two special cases . in the first case",
    ", @xmath9 is so small that only one value of @xmath3 is observed in each time slice .",
    "this results in @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 ) . in the second case , @xmath9 is so large that it includes the entire time series @xmath3 .",
    "this results in @xmath46 . as a consequence",
    ", there exists a long time scale @xmath47 for which @xmath48 holds . with the definitions proposed in @xcite , one could formally use superstatistics to analyse the distribution of any time series whenever @xmath22 and @xmath49 .",
    "but clearly not every time series that fulfills these conditions contains time slices of which one can assume that the variables are locally gaussian distributed .",
    "therefore , in the next section we will derive an extra condition that should hold before we assume that a time series at hand can be described by superstatistics .",
    "assume we found the value of @xmath9 for which @xmath50 equals @xmath43 .",
    "this value is denoted as @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the complete time series is divided in @xmath27 time slices of length @xmath21 .",
    "the second and fourth momentum of these time slices are denoted as @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "then one can express the value of the function @xmath50 for @xmath53 as follows @xmath54 for large data series , the kurtosis of the complete data set @xmath42 is in good approximation equal to @xmath55 because @xmath56 .",
    "formula ( [ kappa_ef ] ) shows that the value of @xmath42 can be calculated starting from the second and fourth momentum of the time slices of length @xmath21 .",
    "now we assume that these time slices contain variables that are approximately gaussian distributed .",
    "we will determine the influence of the deviations from this approximation to the value of @xmath42 .",
    "remember that the moments of purely gaussian distributed random variables are given by ( [ moments ] ) .",
    "however , the variables of a time series are never perfectly gaussian distributed .",
    "we define @xmath57 as the deviation of the fourth momentum from @xmath58 for the time slices of length @xmath21 @xmath59 then expression ( [ kappa_ef ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath60 .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when the gaussian approximation is reasonable in the time slices of length @xmath21 , the contribution of the term @xmath61 to the value of @xmath55 will be small as compared to the contribution of the term @xmath62 . therefore , we expect the gaussian approximation to hold when @xmath63 with @xmath64 we showed that the value of the kurtosis of the complete data set @xmath42 can be expressed as a function of the moments of the times slices of length @xmath21 only .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 basically measures the contribution of the deviations from the gaussian approximation in these time slices to the value of @xmath42 .",
    "more details about the derivation and the interpretation of expression ( [ rule_extra ] ) can be found in appendix [ appa ] . in the next section",
    "we will show that the extra constraint @xmath63 resolves some of the ambiguities of the original approach @xcite .",
    "the major problem of the definition ( [ def_lon ] ) of the long time scale @xmath21 is that it will always give a value for @xmath21 whenever the kurtosis of the complete time series @xmath42 is larger than @xmath43 .",
    "for example , a time series containing gaussian distributed random variables of constant variance with just one outliner can have @xmath49 and @xmath22 without being superstatistical .",
    "also a time series containing q - gaussian @xcite distributed random variables with constant variance can be wrongly classified as being superstatistical . in this section",
    "we use surrogate time series to illustrate that the extra constraint @xmath63 is a useful tool to decide whether a given time series is superstatistical .",

    "this is the dynamics of the example discussed in the introduction , a brownian particle moving through a slowly fluctuating environment .",

    "however , in order to make the resulting surrogate time series superstatistical , the time scale @xmath76 of the fluctuating parameter @xmath70 must be larger than the time scale @xmath77 on which local equilibrium is reached . in this way",
    ", the probability distribution of @xmath3 will relax to a gaussian distribution before the next change of the value of @xmath70 occurs . therefore , we chose @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "in practice we keep the value of @xmath70 constant and iterate the langevin equation over @xmath79 steps .",
    "then we change the value of @xmath70 and iterate the discrete langevin equation again over @xmath79 steps .",
    "we repeat this procedure @xmath80 times .",
    "the result of this procedure is a time series with @xmath81 data points .",
    "we construct two data sets , with different values of the parameters of the distribution ( [ fbeta_surro12 ] ) , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "then we apply the superstatistical approach to these time series .",

    "the corresponding values of @xmath86 are equal to @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "because both inequalities @xmath22 and @xmath63 hold , we conclude that the data series at hand can be described within the superstatistical approach , and that our method to extract the relevant time scales works very well .",

    "the second surrogate data series is constructed out of the first by replacing one of the elements of the first time series by an outliner . as a consequence of this",
    ", the kurtosis of the second time series will generally be larger than @xmath43 and is equal to @xmath93 for our particular example .",
    "therefore , expression ( [ def_lon ] ) would formally give a value for the long time scale when applied to the second data series .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",

    "finally we calculated the value of @xmath86 for the second surrogate data series and obtained @xmath97 .",
    "clearly , the inequality @xmath63 does not hold in this case and the data series at hand can not be described with the superstatistical approach . after removing the outliner ,",
    "one is left with a data series containing just gaussian variables of constant variance ( equivalent to the surrogate data set we started from ) and no value for the long time scale can be found , see fig .",

    "this example shows that one has to be careful when using the superstatistical approach to study data series that contain outliners .",
    "apparently , our criterion @xmath63 can help to identify truly superstatistical dynamics .",

    "our aim here is to identify this time series as being not superstatistical , since there is no long time scale on which the variance changes .",
    "the kurtosis diverges in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "that is the reason why the analysis presented in this section will be restricted to data series containing q - gaussian random variables with @xmath105 .",

    "clearly , the three curves are almost indistinguishable .",
    "more importantly , the curves are increasing functions of the kurtosis ( determined by @xmath100 ) .",
    "this shows that the extra constraint @xmath63 will reject the time series containing purely q - gaussian distributed random variables as being superstatistical when the value of the kurtosis is large enough .",
    "when the value of the kurtosis is close to @xmath43 , the value of @xmath86 will also become small .",
    "however notice that in these cases the corresponding q - gaussian distribution is also better and better approximated by the gaussian distribution .",
    "this means that the assumption of local equilibrium can be relaxed to global equilibrium . as a consequence",
    ", there is no reason to the study these time series within the superstatistical approach , because the usual equilibrium statistical mechanics ( i.e. gaussians with constant variance ) can be used in very good approximation .",
    "after testing our method with various types of surrogate data , we now apply our superstatistical analysis to real experimental data .",

    "contrary to other turbulence data there is no inertial range for these data and no scaling exponents of velocity increments can be defined .",
    "but in @xcite it was shown that the existence of two effective time scales is well supported by the data .",

    "the result is @xmath126 .",

    "we then applied the proposed techniques to two real experimental data series , velocity time series measured in turbulent taylor - couette flow and time series containing the normalized log returns of the closing prices of some stock market indices . for the turbulence data the inequalities @xmath22 and @xmath63",
    "were immediately seen to hold , whereas for the share prices the outliners had to be removed first in order to obtain a realistic superstatistical model .",
    "we conclude that the superstatistical approach can be successfully used to study both data sets .    since the early work of black and scholes @xcite , various techniques borrowed from the field of the theoretical physics were successfully used to study the evolution of stock markets prices and their derivatives .",
    "some recent work in the context of option pricing involves for example the use of continuous - time random walks @xcite , perturbation expansions around the black - scholes formula @xcite and the use of path integrals @xcite .",
    "other authors focus on stochastic volatility and its extraction from a long sequence of data @xcite .",
    "common in all these papers is the observation that the volatility of the log returns @xmath5 of the stock market prices is a stochastic variable with certain distribution .",
    "however the type of this distribution is still under debate .",
    "often the volatility is defined as the average of @xmath130 over a time slice with certain length @xmath9 .",
    "this results in @xmath150 values for the volatility , with @xmath4 the total number of data points .",
    "then one constructs a histogram with these @xmath8 values and searches for the best fit to this distribution using some known distribution .",
    "usually , one examines different values of @xmath9 and observes that the result of the fitting procedure is not crucially dependent on the arbitrary choice of @xmath9 .",
    "notice the differences with the method presented in this paper .",
    "the length of our time slices coincides with long time scale @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , in the context of superstatistics , the value of @xmath9 is fixed by the definition of @xmath21 .",
    "we also use another measure for the volatility . instead of studying the average of @xmath130 over a time slice we study the inverse of the average of @xmath151 .",
    "the reason for this is that in the second step of our method we need the distribution of the latter variable to construct the distribution @xmath31 .",
    "our careful analysis of the different approximations of the superstatistical approach shows that for the hydrodynamic turbulence data our techniques can be applied directly whereas for the economical time series it is better to first remove the outliners .",
    "when outliners are removed , our data sets can be described equally well by gamma superstatistics and lognormal superstatistics .",
    "when outliners are included , gamma superstatistics seems to do the best job .",
    "our approach is inspired by the theory of statistical hypothesis testing . in this context",
    ", the null - hypothesis is the assumption that the data series at hand can be described by the superstatistical approach .",
    "then one has to calculate the values for @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath65 .",
    "one accepts the null - hypothesis when @xmath21 exists and @xmath22 and @xmath63 .",
    "an interesting topic for future research is a statistical analysis of the threshold behavior of @xmath152 and @xmath86 . also other conjectures to falsify the null - hypothesis can be examined .",
    "generally this work will further help to understand the behavior of complex systems with time scale separation , making direct contact with experimental measurements .",
    "we are very grateful to harry swinney for providing us with the measured turbulence data .",
    "gratefully acknowledges private discussions with bart partoens .",
    "the superstatistical long time scale @xmath21 is defined as the value of @xmath9 for which @xmath50 equals @xmath43 , see expression ( [ kazondergem ] ) for the definition of @xmath50 .",
    "assume that we have found the value of the long time scale .",
    "this means that the complete time series is divided in @xmath27 time slices of length @xmath21 .",
    "the superstatistical model assumption is valid when the variables within these time slices are in good approximation gaussian distributed with a certain variance @xmath51 , with @xmath153 .",
    "we defined @xmath57 as the deviation of the fourth momentum from @xmath58 in the @xmath13th time slice of length @xmath21 , see expression ( [ def_theta ] ) .",
    "continue by dividing the complete time series in @xmath154 time slices of length @xmath155 with @xmath156 .",
    "we will show in this appendix that the value of @xmath157 can be expressed as a function of @xmath51 and @xmath57 only .",
    "the contribution of @xmath57 to the value of @xmath157 is a measure for the deviations from the gaussian distribution in the time slices of length @xmath21 .",
    "first notice that the moments within the @xmath13th time slice of length @xmath158 can be written as a sum of the moments within the time slices of length @xmath21 @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",
    "this gives for the fourth momentum and @xmath161 @xmath162 where @xmath163 to understand the meaning of @xmath164 and @xmath165 , we study an example .",
    "assume @xmath166 which means that we look for the first time slice of length @xmath158 .",
    "this time slice contains the first @xmath167 time slices of length @xmath21 , with corresponding values of the inverse variance @xmath168 respectively . for this special case , the expressions for @xmath164 and @xmath165 simplify to @xmath169 @xmath164 is the variance of @xmath170 calculated over @xmath167 values of this parameter .",
    "@xmath165 is the average of @xmath171 over @xmath167 values of this parameter .",
    "@xmath164 vanishes when the fluctuations of @xmath172 are small .",
    "@xmath165 vanishes when the gaussian approximation for the time slices of length @xmath21 holds .",
    "we continue by summing the expression @xmath173 over all the time slices @xmath154 .",
    "this results in an expression for @xmath174 @xmath175 notice that this formula explains the difference in profoundness of the minimum between the two graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] . for both curves ,",
    "the contribution of @xmath176 is small compared to the contribution of @xmath177 and can be ignored ( remember these graphs are obtained for surrogate data , where we imposed gaussian distributed random variables ) .",
    "however , the values of @xmath178 are clearly different for the two graphs , because of the difference in the imposed distribution @xmath89 , see fig .  [ fig02 ] .",
    "the narrower the distribution @xmath89 , the smaller the fluctuations of the parameter @xmath172 , the less profound the minimum of the graph of @xmath94 .    the contribution of @xmath165 to @xmath173 vanishes when the gaussian approximation in the time slices of length @xmath21 holds .",
    "so this term measures the deviations from pure gaussian behavior in these time slices .",
    "we propose to study the difference between the exact value of @xmath174 with @xmath179 and expression ( [ kappa_approx ] ) with @xmath180 for all @xmath13 to decide whether a given time series can be described within the superstatistical approach .",
    "clearly , this difference will show fluctuations as a function of @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to evaluate this difference in the limit @xmath181 in order to quantify the influence of @xmath165 to the exact value of @xmath174 .",
    "for the special case @xmath182 , formula ( [ apa1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath183 then we obtain for @xmath184 ( or @xmath55 , because there is only one time slice for this special case ) @xmath185 . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that for large data series , the kurtosis of the complete data set @xmath42 is in good approximation equal to @xmath55 because @xmath56 .",
    "when the gaussian approximation is reasonable in the time slices of length @xmath21 , the contribution of the term @xmath61 to the value of @xmath55 will be small as compared to the contribution of the term @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , we expect the gaussian approximation to hold when @xmath63 with @xmath186 the value of @xmath65 basically measures the contribution of the deviations from the gaussian approximation in the time slices of length @xmath21 to the value of the kurtosis of the complete data set .    finally we illustrate the physical interpretation of the formulas we derived above by applying them to the real experimental data that we already studied in section [ section_dist_fb ] .",
    "we repeated the calculation of @xmath94 as a function of @xmath9 with formula ( [ kazondergem ] ) .",
    "the result can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ( solid line ) .",
    "then , we evaluated expression ( [ kappa_approx ] ) with @xmath180 for all @xmath13 ( @xmath113 ) . clearly , the difference between the solid line and the curve represented by ( @xmath113 ) is small .",
    "this shows that the contribution of the term @xmath187 to the value of @xmath157 is small as compared to the contribution of the term @xmath188 .",
    "hence the gaussian approximation in the time slices of length @xmath21 is reasonable because the term @xmath187 measures the deviation from this approximation .",
    "the value of @xmath86 corresponds to the difference between the solid line and the curve represented by ( @xmath113 ) in the limit @xmath189 . for this example",
    "we obtain @xmath126 .      in this appendix",
    "we calculate the mathematical expectation of the kurtosis @xmath133 of a time series with length @xmath9 averaged over a gaussian statistics @xmath190 to calculate these @xmath9 integrals it is convenient to consider a transformation to hyperspherical coordinates @xcite @xmath191 with @xmath192 $ ] , @xmath193 $ ] and @xmath194 $ ] .",
