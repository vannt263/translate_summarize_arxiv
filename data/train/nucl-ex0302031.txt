    "the results presented here are based on phobos data taken during the first two rhic physics runs for au - au collisions at @xmath0 19.6 , 130 and 200 gev .",
    "event centrality ( impact parameter ) is characterized by the number of participating nucleons , @xmath2 , allowing direct comparison to elementary systems , like @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the phobos detector consists mainly of silicon pad sensors to perform particle tracking , vertex detection and multiplicity measurements .",
    "this set of detectors has nearly full azimuthal coverage over a large pseudorapidity range @xmath6  5.4 .",
    "details of the layout of the si sensors can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our methods for event triggering and centrality selection have been previously described @xcite .",
    "the raw data came in the form of energy depositions from the passage of charged particles above threshold through individual si pads , known as hits .",
    "the position of the primary collision vertex was determined on an event - by - event basis by extrapolating tracks found in the spectrometer arms and/or the vertex detector .",
    "the particle emission pattern created in heavy - ion collisions can be probed by measuring azimuthal anisotropy about the event plane , _",
    "i.e. _ , elliptic flow .",
    "the event plane was determined by a standard subevent technique @xcite using hits in symmetric and uniform regions of the octagonal barrel multiplicity detector .",
    "the second fourier coefficient of the hit azimuthal angle distribution , v@xmath7 , ( elliptic flow ) was evaluated by correlating the event plane to hits in a different region of the multiplicity detectors and corrected for event plane resolution .",
    "details of this flow analysis are provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "flow results are shown in fig .",
    "[ v2etaener ] , where the error bars indicate 1@xmath8 statistical errors .",
    "the 90% confidence level systematic errors are shown as boxes for the 200 gev data points . the flow signal changes little with the increase in the center - of - mass energy of the collision from 130 to 200 gev . fig .",
    "[ v2etaener ] shows a substantial drop in v@xmath7 as a function of @xmath9 in contradiction with the idea of longitudinal boost invariance over a broad rapidity range in rhic collisions .",
    "fig .  [ limfrag ] shows charged particle pseudorapidity distributions scaled by the number of participant pairs , @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 ) , measured at three different rhic energies for peripheral ( @xmath12 ) and central events ( @xmath13 ) , in the left and right panels , respectively .",
    "shifting into the rest frame of one of the colliding nuclei clearly demonstrates the `` limiting behavior '' in the fragmentation region , _",
    "i.e. _ , the distributions are independent of beam energy over a substantial range in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "similar behavior has been observed in @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , and @xmath16 @xcite collisions over a large range of energies . in fig .",
    "[ limfrag ] the extent of the limiting fragmentation region significantly grows with collision energy in sharp contrast to a boost - invariant scenario .",
    "comparison of the data at a fixed beam energy between the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ limfrag ] demonstrates that even though the shapes of the distributions dramatically change , the extent of the fragmentation region is nearly independent of centrality .",
    "the total charged particle multiplicity , @xmath17 , was determined by integrating @xmath18 , where the low energy data along with fits to the higher energy data was used to extrapolate out to larger @xmath14 for the higher energies . repeating this procedure at each beam energy for all centrality classes results in fig .",
    "[ ntot ] , which shows @xmath19 is centrality independent .    in fig .",
    "[ total_ratio ] , @xmath19 in central heavy - ion collisions @xcite is compared to @xmath16 and @xmath20 data over a large range in collision energy , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 is observed to lie below @xmath3 at low energies , passing through the @xmath3 data around @xmath22 gev , and then gradually converging with the @xmath16 trend above cern sps energies .",
    "these comparisons can be made clearer by dividing all of the data with a fit to the @xmath16 data @xcite as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ total_ratio ] .",
    "the @xmath20 data ( open squares ) follows the same trend as @xmath16 , but agrees better if rescaled to an `` effective energy '' @xmath23 ( open diamonds ) , which approximately accounts for the leading particle effect seen in @xmath3 collisions @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds that bulk particle production in @xmath3 and @xmath16 data does not depend in detail on the collision system , but rather the energy available for particle production . in this scenario ,",
    "the au - au data suggests a substantially reduced leading particle effect in central collisions of heavy nuclei at high energy @xcite .",
    "modulation of the leading particle effect in nuclear collisions may be the result of multiple scattering .",
    "for example , each participating nucleon is typically struck three times on average as it passes through the oncoming au nucleus for @xmath24 .",
    "this rescattering could transfer much more of the initial longitudinal energy into particle production .",
    "this naturally leads to the scaling of total particle production in heavy - ion collisions with @xmath2 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ ntot ] , suggestive of the `` wounded nucleon model '' @xcite but with the scaling factor determined by @xmath16 rather than @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recent results from phobos at rhic indicate clear evidence of limiting fragmentation in au - au collisions . also , longitudinal boost invariance occurs only over a limited region , because this fragmentation region grows with beam energy , along with the pronounced drop in flow at high @xmath25 .",
    "finally , there is a striking similarity of particle production in @xmath16 and particle production per participating nucleon pair in au - au collisions .",
