    "in the outer solar system beyond the orbit of neptune is a large belt of minor planets , the kuiper belt , whose dynamics has been understood , over the past two decades , to be significantly controlled by the gravity of the giant planets , jupiter ",
    "neptune , either through secular or resonant perturbations or by gravitational scattering . however , there are a few known kuiper belt objects [ kbos ] that are unlikely to be significantly perturbed by the known giant planets in their current orbits . in the dynamical classification scheme for the small bodies of the outer solar system ,",
    "such objects ( semimajor axis , @xmath1 , and perihelion distance , @xmath2 , exceeding 150 au and 40 au , respectively ) would likely belong in a class known as `` detached objects '' , distinct from the classical kbos , the resonant kbos and the scattered / scattering kbos  @xcite . @xcite call them `` extreme '' kbos [ ekbos , henceforth ] . upon querying the minor planet center s catalog ,",
    "we identify six kbos having @xmath3  au and @xmath4  au ; two of these are numbered and four are unnumbered : sedna ( 90377 ) , 2010 gb174 , 2004 vn112 , 2012 vp113 , ( 148209 ) , 2013 gp136 .",
    "their orbital inclinations are in the range 11.933.5 degrees ( to the ecliptic ) , not especially remarkable for kbos .",
    "however all of these objects have extremely large orbital eccentricity , @xmath5 , suggesting large orbital perturbation in their past history .",
    "this is rather at odds with their current large separations from the known giant planets .",
    "a natural hypothesis is that these objects orbital dynamics were or are dominated by the gravitational perturbations of a planet in the heliocentric distance range of a few hundred au .",
    "@xcite hypothesized a `` rogue '' planet , a short - lived planet larger than an earth - mass , to explain the ekbos .",
    "@xcite proposed an extant hypothetical distant planet to explain an apparent clustering of the arguments of perihelion of the ekbos .",
    "@xcite have also argued for this hypothesis by calling attention to the clustering of the eccentricity vectors and orbit poles of some distant kbos .",
    "these authors suggest a planet mass of @xmath6 , and an orbit with semimajor axis @xmath7  au , and eccentricity @xmath8 . @xcite",
    "provide an analysis of _ cassini _ tracking data , arguing that , for the favored planet parameters of @xcite , the residuals in the orbital motion of saturn are reduced with the existence of such a planet at current true longitude near @xmath9 ; however their analysis can not exclude a large range of true longitudes , @xmath10 , where the planet would be too distant to sufficiently perturb saturn .    here",
    "we report additional support for the extant distant planet hypothesis , and we narrow the range of its parameters and its current location .",
    "we point out hitherto unnoticed peculiarities of the orbits of the ekbos : we find that the orbital period ratios of these objects are close to integer ratios .",
    "such ratios are not dynamically significant unless the ekbos are in mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) with a massive planet .",
    "we identify an orbital period of the hypothetical planet which is in simple integer ratios with the four most distant ekbos .",
    "we show that the resonant dynamics provide constraints on the planet s orbital parameters and its mass and can also narrow the possible range of its current location in its orbital path .",
    "the wide range of the perihelion  to - aphelion distances of each ekbo may overlap those of the hypothetical planet [ hp , henceforth ] . in this circumstance",
    ", the extreme eccentricities of the ekbos may be a natural consequence of gravitational scattering encounters with the planet .",
    "the dynamical survival of scattered objects over solar system age could be simply due to the long timescales of close encounters at these distances , or it could be due to enhanced dynamical stability offered by phase - protection in mean motion resonances with hp . in their analysis , @xcite emphasized the secular effects of the planets in aligning the orbits of the ekbos , but also noted that transient resonant interactions would be important .",
    "here we investigate the possibility of extant mmrs of the known ekbos with the unseen planet .    examining the orbital periods of the six ekbos as listed in the minor planet center s catalog , and ordering them in order of decreasing orbital period ( so sedna is ekbo#1 , with the longest period orbit ) , here is what we find for the ratios @xmath11 : @xmath12 these values are close to the following rational ratios : 8/5 , 2/1 , 8/3 , 10/3 , and 6/1 , sufficiently intriguing to investigate further .",
    "we proceeded as follows .",
    "we computed the best - fit orbits for these six ekbos , as well as their uncertainties , using the orbit - fitting software developed by @xcite ; for these orbit - fits , we included all of the astrometric measurements for the objects listed in the minor planet center .",
    "we find the following best - fit semimajor axes and their 1@xmath13 uncertainties ( all quoted in au ) : @xmath14 these osculating barycentric elements agree well with the heliocentric mpc orbits when both are converted to heliocentric cartesian positions and velocities .",
    "we then consider some simple possibilities for hp s resonant orbit .",
    "assume that its orbital period @xmath15 is longer than @xmath16 , but not by too much , else its gravitational effects would not be very strong .",
    "so , we consider @xmath17 values of 2/1 or 3/2 or 4/3 .",
    "we find that the case of @xmath18 ( hence @xmath19  au ) is particularly striking , for it yields period ratios close to 5/2 , 3/1 , and 4/1 for @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the other simple choices ( @xmath17 values of 2/1 or 4/3 ) yield larger integer ratios for @xmath23 . although these larger integer ratios can not be ruled out _ prima facie _",
    ", we limit this first study to the small integer ratio mmrs ; other mmrs will be considered in a future study .",
    "the orbit period @xmath15 of hp is assumed to be 3/2 times sedna s best - fit orbital period , @xmath24  11,411  years .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines indicate the rational ratios 3/2 , 5/2 , 3/1 4/1 , 5/1 and 9/1 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ f : pratios ] , we plot the period ratios @xmath25 for the best - fit orbits with their uncertainties .",
    "we observe that , within 3@xmath13 uncertainties , four of the six ekbos have periods near n/1 or n/2 ratios with hp , when we take the latter s period to be 1.5 times sedna s best - fit period .",
    "we also observe that the error bars are not insubstantial and one can be skeptical of any perceived coincidence with simple ratios .",
    "we remark that our procedure for computing the uncertainties weights all published observations equally and may overestimate the true errors .",
    "secondly , one might also be skeptical of the period ratio coincidences because not all possible n/1 and n/2 period ratios in the range shown are occupied . on this point",
    ", we can remark that ( a ) the larger n values lead to shorter period orbits in which hp s influence is diminished and neptune s influence looms larger , potentially destabilizing the resonances with hp , and ( b ) the small number of currently known ekbos will occupy only a small fraction of all possible n/1 , n/2 period ratios .",
    "thirdly , one can ask if the proximity to the resonant ratios is different from random .",
    "we answer this question approximately , as follows . for integer values @xmath26",
    ", there are 31 distinct rational numbers @xmath27 in the range @xmath28 , so the mean distance between said rationals is @xmath29 .",
    "we can compare this mean value to the distances of the observed period ratios to the resonant ratios .",
    "taking account of the 3@xmath13 observational uncertainties , the latter are 0.007 , 0.27 , 0.27 , 0.26 , 0.21 , and 0.46 , respectively ( listed in increasing period ratio , as in fig .  [ f : pratios ] ) .",
    "the shortest period ekbo , 2013 gp136 , presents the largest distance ( from the 9/1 ratio ) , as is evident in fig .",
    "[ f : pratios ] .",
    "sedna s very small distance to the 3/2 ratio is explained by its very small orbital uncertainties and because its period ratio of 3/2 is fixed by hypothesis .",
    "the remaining four values are similar to the mean distance between the rationals , indicating that they are not strongly distinct from random . however , this statistical argument depends upon how many rationals are allowed and it does not consider any physics of mmrs",
    ". we will show later ( section 2.2 ) that the libration widths of the specific mmrs are similar to these apparent distances from exact resonant ratios ; hence , libration in mmrs is possible even with the significant apparent distances from exact resonant ratios .",
    "we therefore proceed with investigating the implications of these mmrs for the four longest period ekbos .",
    "1truein -2.1truein      stable resonant orbits of the ekbos will avoid close approaches with hp , and will have a discrete number of geometries for the conjunctions of the ekbo with the planet .",
    "these are described by librations of the critical resonant angle , @xmath30 as usual , in the definition of the resonant angle , @xmath31 and @xmath2 are integers , @xmath32 the mean longitudes and @xmath33 the longitudes of perihelion ; we use the prime to refer to orbital parameters of the planet , the parameters of the ekbo are unprimed .",
    "depending upon the orbital eccentricity , @xmath34 may be stable at either 0 or at @xmath35 or at both .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ f : resonantorbits ] the trace of the resonant orbits ( of zero libration amplitude ) in the frame co - rotating with the mean angular velocity of hp .",
    "also included here are the traces of a few possible coplanar orbits of hp , with eccentricity @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we observe that for sedna , stable libration is likely only near @xmath38 , and unlikely near @xmath39 , because the latter would allow small encounter distances .",
    "( this is the opposite of the geometry for the low eccentricity regime in which stable ( unstable ) librations are centered at @xmath40 . )",
    "consequently , conjunctions with hp occur near one of three longitudes , @xmath41 and @xmath35 from sedna s longitude of perihelion .",
    "moreover , the long term stability of sedna would limit @xmath42 .",
    "likewise , a coplanar orbit of 2010 gb174 with @xmath38 limits @xmath43 ; however , in the geometry with @xmath39 , the limit is @xmath44 . the orbit of 2004 vn112 limits @xmath45 for @xmath38 .    of course , strict coplanarity of hp is possible for at most one ekbo , because the ekbos orbits are not coplanar .",
    "[ f : hpplane ] shows the ecliptic latitude and longitude of the orbit normal vectors of each of the four potentially resonant ekbos .",
    "we see that they are somewhat clustered , approximately within one quadrant of ecliptic longitudes ; they have relative inclinations 715 degrees to their mean plane .",
    "the non - coplanarity of the orbits with hp s orbit plane may relax the upper limit on @xmath46 , especially if the ekbo s argument of perihelion @xmath47 ( relative to hp s orbit plane ) were near @xmath48 .",
    "this would have the effect of lifting the ekbo s aphelion away from the hp orbit plane and thereby increasing the closest approach distances and enhancing dynamical stability , and it librates about @xmath49 with a period of about 4 megayears  @xcite . ] .",
    "such a configuration is associated with the so - called `` periodic orbits of the third kind '' envisioned by henri poincar ( as noted by @xcite ) and computed by @xcite @xcite and @xcite for the three dimensional circular restricted three body problem .",
    "such periodic orbits are characterized by simultaneous stationarity of the resonant angle @xmath34 ( at 0 or @xmath35 ) and of the argument of perihelion @xmath47 ( at @xmath50 or @xmath35 or @xmath51 ) .",
    "physically , we can visualize these periodic orbits as having a fixed orbit plane and a fixed eccentricity vector ( i.e. , the apsidal precession rates of both node and pericenter vanish ) . in the particular case of @xmath52 , the particle reaches aphelion when it is at its largest excursion away from the plane of the planet .",
    "we computed the values of @xmath47 relative to the mean plane of the four longest period ekbos , finding that they are @xmath53    -1.2truein within 45 degrees of @xmath51 .",
    "the region shaded in magenta identifies the subset for which the relative inclinations of the ekbos are also within 10 degrees of the stationary inclination values at the periodic orbit of the third kind.,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.2truein    we look for an alternative hp orbit plane for which @xmath47 is proximate to @xmath48 , within some specified tolerance , for all of the four ekbos .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "let @xmath54 be the ( unknown ) unit vector normal to the hp orbit plane .",
    "let @xmath55 be the unit vector in the orbit plane of an ekbo and normal to its eccentricity vector .",
    "we ask whether @xmath55 can be rotated by no more than a specified amount , @xmath56 , in the ekbo s orbit plane , such that @xmath57 changes sign ; if so , this would indicate that the ekbo has @xmath47 within @xmath56 of @xmath51 , near the periodic orbit of the 3rd kind . by demanding that all four ekbos satisfy this constraint",
    ", we identify the range of possible @xmath54 .",
    "the results of this search are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : hpplane ] , in which we plot in grey the ecliptic longitude and latitude of the allowed @xmath54 s for @xmath58 .",
    "we narrow the possible hp planes further by examining the inclinations of the ekbos to possible hp orbit planes .",
    "consulting the results of @xcite , we find that the stationary inclinations ( relative to hp s orbit plane ) are @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , respectively , for the specific mmrs and the observed eccentricities of the four ekbos . of course , these ekbos are likely librating with non - zero amplitude about the pertinent periodic orbit , so we look for those @xmath54 s that yield inclinations within @xmath61 of these values . carrying out this search",
    ", we find the range indicated in magenta in fig .",
    "[ f : hpplane ] satisfies this constraint .",
    "we conclude that an hp orbit plane with inclination near @xmath62 and longitude of ascending node near @xmath63 allows all four resonant ekbos to be in proximity of the periodic orbits of the third kind .",
    "resonant perturbations from hp provide phase - protection if an ekbo is sufficiently close to the exact resonant orbit .",
    "how close is close enough depends upon the planet mass .",
    "we now quantify this condition .    in the usual canonical variables , @xmath64 the orbital perturbation equations are given by @xmath65 where the perturbation hamiltonian is @xmath66 here the first equation gives the newtonian perturbation potential ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 are the position vectors of an ekbo and of hp , respectively , in jacobi coordinates  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; i.e. , they are relative to the barycenter of the sun and the known planets ) , whereas the second equation gives an approximation for the resonant perturbation",
    ". the dependence of the resonant perturbation on the canonical variables can be expressed as a product of an amplitude @xmath69 which is a function of only the canonical momenta , and a phase @xmath70 which is an even function of the resonant angle .",
    "( @xmath71 also depends on the orbital parameters of hp , which will be assumed to be constant . ) without loss of generality , we can define @xmath71 and @xmath72 such that @xmath73 for @xmath74 . for the ekbos whose extreme eccentricities are near unity",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath71 will be of order a few .",
    "when we require numerical values ( below ) , we will adopt @xmath75 ; but this value can , in principle , be determined more accurately with numerical averaging of the perturbation potential .    the mean motion of the ekbo is @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the resonant perturbations of the mean motion are given by @xmath77 , whence we obtain the following equation of motion for @xmath34 , @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "this equation for @xmath34 resembles the nonlinear pendulum .",
    "the small amplitude oscillation frequency is given by @xmath80 for the resonances of interest , the corresponding libration periods are on the order of a few megayears for a few - earth - mass planet .",
    "by analogy with the pendulum , we divine that @xmath34 ( hence the conjunction longitudes @xmath81 ) can execute librations about stable equilibrium points provided @xmath82 . thus the required condition for resonance is that the deviation of the mean motion of the ekbo from the exact resonant value , @xmath83 , should not exceed @xmath84 .",
    "then , by kepler s third law , the resonance width in semimajor axis is given by @xmath85 computing the widths of the 3/2 , 5/2 , 3/1 and 4/1 resonances for the four ekbos of interest , we find that a @xmath86 planet yields @xmath87 values comparable to the uncertainties in the semimajor axes of these objects .    the more severe condition on the planet mass obtains when we demand that the ekbos are in libration about periodic orbits of the third kind .",
    "the frequency of small amplitude oscillations about these periodic orbits or @xmath88 mmrs , are often inaccurately referred to as `` kozai within mmr '' .",
    "they can be considered to be the discrete sequence whose limit for @xmath89 is the kozai - lidov resonance  @xcite .",

    "is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 are a resonant ekbo s mean motion , semimajor axis , eccentricity and inclination ( relative to hp s orbit plane ) , @xmath92 is the planet s semi - minor axis , and @xmath93 is a numerical coefficient whose asymptotic value is @xmath94 for @xmath95 ( @xmath93 will be larger for @xmath1 approaching @xmath96 ) . for numerical estimates ,",
    "we adopt @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we find that , for @xmath99 , the small amplitude oscillation periods for the four ekbos are 0.60.94  gyr , a factor of a few smaller than the age of the solar system .",
    "we conclude that @xmath86 is approximately the minimum mass necessary to maintain periodic orbits of the third kind for the four ekbos .",
    "each resonant ekbo constrains the longitude of hp because the critical resonant angle must librate about either 0 or @xmath100 . for illustration , consider the libration of @xmath101 about @xmath100 for sedna s 3/2 resonant orbit .",
    "given that sedna is presently near its perihelion , @xmath102 , the planet can be in proximity to one of three longitudes : @xmath103 or @xmath100 or @xmath104 from sedna s longitude of perihelion , @xmath33 . the trace of the resonant orbit in the rotating frame ( fig .",
    "[ f : resonantorbits ] ) shows that libration of @xmath34 would allow the planet to be located as far as @xmath105 from these longitudes .",

    "the former offers dynamical stability of the four ekbos by means of libration of the critical resonant angles , and the latter offers enhanced dynamical stability by means of additional libration of the argument of perihelion associated with _ periodic orbits of the third kind _ ( a class of periodic orbits of the three dimensional restricted three body problem ) .    in the case of coplanar mmrs , the planet s orbital eccentricity is limited to @xmath121 by the putative 3/2 resonant orbit of sedna , and to @xmath44 by the putative 5/2 resonant orbit of 2010 gb174 . for non - coplanar orbits , including the periodic orbits of the third kind , the planet s eccentricity may be larger than these limits .",

    "our analysis supports the distant planet hypothesis , but should not be considered definitive proof of its existence .",
    "the orbital period ratios have significant uncertainties , so the near - coincidences with mmrs may simply be by chance for a small number of bodies .",
    "we encourage further observations of these ekbos to reduce the uncertainties in their orbital periods ; a factor of @xmath126 reduction in the uncertainties would provide a clear test of our specific mmr hypothesis for a @xmath124 planet .",
    "future work should also examine other possible sets of mmrs .    as a final point , we note that the long orbital timescales in this region of the outer solar system may allow formally unstable orbits to persist for very long times , possibly even to the age of the solar system , depending on the planet mass ; if so , this would weaken the argument for a resonant planet orbit .",
    "in future work it would be useful to investigate scattering efficiency as a function of the planet mass , as well as dynamical lifetimes of non - resonant planet - crossing orbits in this region of the outer system .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility that resonant orbital relations could be a useful aid to prediction and discovery of additional high mass planets in the distant solar system makes a stimulating case for renewed study of aspects of solar system dynamics , such as resonant dynamics in the high eccentricity regime , which have hitherto garnered insufficient attention .",
