    "light front field theories have been the subject of considerable interest in the past few years as they promise to provide a practical tool for solving the problem of highly relativistic bound states @xcite .",
    "there are two major approaches to obtaining the bound state wave functions in the light - cone framework the light front tamm dancoff ( lftd ) method @xcite and the discretized light cone quantization ( dlcq ) method @xcite  both of these based on diagonalizing the light cone hamiltonian in the basis of fock states .",
    "both of these approaches are beset by the usual ultraviolet divergences of field theory coming from large transverse momenta , as well as by infrared divergences near @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the longitudinal momentum .",
    "the infrared divergences can be classified into two different categories`spurious ' ir ( infra - red ) divergences and ` true ' ir divergences .",
    "the spurious ir divergences are just a manifestation of the ultraviolet divergences of equal time theory and can be regularized by an ir cutoff on small values of longitudinal momentum @xcite .",
    "the ` true ' ir divergences are the bona - fide infrared divergences of the equal time theory and are present due to particles being on mass shell . these can be taken care of by giving the photon a small mass @xcite .",
    "in the present work we suggest an alternative treatment of this latter kind of ir divergences . addressing this excercise may seem unnecessary in the case of qed , since a simple solution ( i.e. giving photon a small mass ) already exists .",
    "however , the suggested formalism may turn out to be useful in future work on non - abelian gauge theories , where giving mass to the gauge particles violates gauge invariance .",
    "both lftd and dlcq are based on the old - fashioned hamiltonian perturbation theory , wherein one calculates the matrix elements of the light front hamiltonian between fock states . in the present paper",
    ", we propose another set of basis states  the coherent states  to calculate these matrix elements .",
    "the usefulness of coherent states in the proof of cancellation of ir divergences in equal time theories has been well established @xcite .",
    "chung has shown that the ir divergences of qed are eliminated to all orders in perturbation theory in the matrix elements by an appropriate choice of initial and final soft photon states@xcite .",
    "fadeev and kulish investigated the asymptotic behaviour of the qed hamiltonian and showed that when a particle mass becomes negligible compared to the energy scale , the asymptotic hamiltonian need not coincide with the free one .",
    "this leads to a redefinition of asymptotic states@xcite :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the asymptotic evolution operator and @xmath5 is a fock state .",
    "they further showed the cancellation of ir divergences when the matrix elements were calculated between these coherent states . in the light - front theories ,",
    "one can make use of this property of coherent states to separate the two kinds of ir divergences .",
    "as a first step in this direction , we have , in this paper , calculated the lowest order radiative correction to the three point vertex in null plane qed using the coherent state basis . this calculation has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite  henceforth referred to as i in the fock state basis .",
    "the main subjects of i are the ultraviolet and spurious ir divergences , and the problem of ` true ' ir divergences has been treated by giving the photon a small mass .",
    "we shall use their expression for the vertex correction _ without _ giving the photon a mass , and show that the true ir divergences present in this expression are cancelled in the coherent state basis by additional contributions coming from the emission and absorbtion of soft photons .",
    "the present formalism has been developed for continuum light - cone qed . however ,",
    "if applicable to discretized case , it may help to provide a solution to the problem of troublesome zero modes@xcite .",
    "in discretized light cone qed , one has to eliminate the @xmath6 , @xmath7 state by an artificial ir cutoff in order to obtain convergence .",
    "the present work was inspired by the hope that the coehrent state formalism developed here may provide an alternative solution to this problem .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii , for the sake of completeness we shall set our notation and present the relevant result of i. in section iii , we shall define the asymptotic region and coherent states in the light - cone framework .",
    "section iv presents the main result of this paper .",
    "we calculate the transition matrix element between coherent states and show the cancellation of true ir divergences .",
    "section v contains some concluding remarks regarding the possible usefulness of coherent state formalism in dlcq calculations .",
    "appendix a contains some useful properties of coherent states and appendix b presents the details of the calculation in section iv .",
    "we shall use the notation of i.    the light - cone qed hamiltonian is given by @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the free hamiltonian as a function of independent degrees of freedom , and @xmath10 is the three point vertex interaction . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are non - local effective four point vertices corresponding to instantaneous fermion and photon exchange respectively .",
    "detailed expressions for @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not needed for our purposes , and can be found in i.    @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be expanded in terms of creation and annihilation operators as usual , @xmath15 @xmath16\\;,\\ ] ] @xmath17 @xmath18\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21= \\delta ( q^+ - q^{\\prime + } ) \\delta^2 ( q_\\perp - q_\\perp^ \\prime ) \\delta_{\\lambda,\\lambda^\\prime } = \\delta^3 ( q - q^\\prime ) \\delta_{\\lambda,\\lambda^\\prime}\\;.\\ ] ]    the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of annihilation and creation operators .",

    "for massive particles as well as for massless particles with @xmath59 , the condition @xmath60 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : irdiv ] ) is equivalent to putting an ultraviolet regulator on large values of @xmath61 in the usual space time formulation .",
    "however , for a massless particle at @xmath62 , the divergences near @xmath1 are the true ir divergences of equal time theory , and in this region the condition @xmath63 does not follow from the condition of an ultraviolet cutoff on @xmath61 .",
    "the ir divergences in equal time qed are cancelled in the cross sections when a sum is taken over all possible initial and final states with any number of soft photons having momenta below the threshold of obesrvability .",
    "chung @xcite suggested that the origin of ir divergences lies in an inappropriate choice of initial and final states to represent the experimental situation and showed that the matrix elements do not have ir divergences if initial and final states are chosen to be appropriately defined coherent states instead of the usual fock states .",
    "kulish and faddev @xcite argued that since the asymptotic hamiltonian does not coincide with the free one in qed , the matrix elements should be calculated between coherent states instead of the fock states .",
