    ", we only mention two technical issues that are relatively easy to deal with .",
    "first , note that in order to apply lemma  [ lem : lowerboundgeneral2 ] , we can not keep @xmath141 as defined in  ( [ eq : def_c ] ) ; this time , we set @xmath636 we do not necessarily have @xmath637 anymore but still it is the case that @xmath638 .",
    "( recall that @xmath85 in the proof of part ( a ) . ) this time there is no need to reduce the number of cliques for the union bound to work , so we may keep @xmath639 , which simplifies the argument slightly .",
    "the last difference is with the application of lemma  [ lem : vu ] .",
    "this time the expected value of @xmath640 ( see  ( [ eq : expectation_for_vu ] ) ) is not large enough for the lemma to be directly applied .",
    "however , as standard in such situations , one can increase the probability @xmath24 to some value @xmath641 for which the expected value of @xmath642 is of order greater than @xmath643 ( which equals @xmath39 in the case @xmath85 we deal with in part(a ) ) as required .",
    "for such a value @xmath644 , it follows that whp   for any pair @xmath348 we have @xmath645 , and by standard coupling arguments the same holds for @xmath24 .",
    "the rest of the proof is not affected .",
    "exactly the same adjustments are required for part ( b ) , this time with @xmath547 .",
    "let us pick up two points for further thought .",
    "* we investigated the clique colouring number @xmath8 for random graphs @xmath47 , and in theorem  [ thm : gnp ] we obtained fairly good estimates for values of @xmath1 , other than @xmath646 where @xmath399 drops dramatically as @xmath24 increases . by parts ( a ) and ( c ) , for suitable @xmath647 ( going to 0 slowly ) , if @xmath648 then @xmath649 whp ; whereas if @xmath650 then @xmath651 whp . for intermediate values of @xmath24 ,",
    "all we say in part ( b ) is that @xmath8 lies whpbetween the values @xmath652 and @xmath653",
