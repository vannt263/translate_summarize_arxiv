    "the continuous random network model of network glasses is widely accepted as a model for materials like vitreous silica and amorphous silicon  @xcite .",
    "although it is more than eighty years since zachariasen proposed this model of glasses  @xcite , and experimental evidence has been compelling over the years , especially through diffraction experiments  @xcite , it has never been quite conclusive since the probability distribution of rings of various sizes has been elusive to determine explicitly experimentally .",
    "this situation has now changed dramatically with the discovery and imaging  @xcite of two dimensional bilayers of vitreous silica . here ,",
    "not only the distribution of rings , but the actual detailed atomic ring structure has been imaged for the first time in real space , removing all speculation from this subject ( at least for this class of materials ) .",
    "these are the first examples of which we are aware of real space imaging of a random network and as such represent tours de force .",
    "previously only small _ defect _ patches have been imaged , as for example for graphene as reported by geim  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we provide the first atomic level computer model for a vitreous silica bilayer and demonstrate some intriguing and unexpected features that are shown to agree with experiment .",
    "there is a symmetry plane through the center of the bilayer where all the oxygen atoms that connect the tetrahedra in the lower and upper planes of the bilayer lie .",
    "each tetrahedron comprises an sio@xmath0 unit and the whole bilayer is a perfect corner - sharing continuous random network with the same chemical formula sio@xmath1 as @xmath2 bulk vitreous silica .",
    "each monolayer is amorphous with rings from 4 up to about 9 in size , consistent of course with euler s theorem that the average ring size is 6 . because of the amorphous nature of the monolayer and the need for oxygen bridges connecting the upper and lower layers , it is necessary for the two layers to have the same ring structure and be _ topologically _ identical to form a complete corner sharing tetrahedral network .",
    "the result that the two layers are also _ geometrical _ mirror images of each other is quite surprising at first sight in a system that is _ a priori _ without any symmetry , but comes about from understanding the nature of the constraints within the network as explained later .",
    "this is consistent with our detailed atomic modeling and also is in accord with the experimental results  @xcite which show that the upper and lower layers do lie one on top of the other as required by a symmetry plane .",
    "we note that this does _ not _ imply that there is a three fold axis between the two upper and lower tetrahedral units ( tetrahedral pair ) through the common central oxygen atom - rather this si - o - si angle through the central oxygen has a distribution of values throughout the sample , as do all the other si - o - si angles in the bilayer",

    "thin vitreous sio@xmath3 films ( interpreted as bilayers ) have been grown on mo(112 ) @xcite , ru(0001 ) @xcite and graphene @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : rings_expt ] shows the experimentally - obtained ring statistics from references  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "a key observation is that the ring statistics obtained from the two experimental samples are not the same , although this is not surprising in view of their different preparation conditions , analogous to various fictive temperatures used to characterize the preparation conditions for bulk silica  @xcite .",
    "what is unclear is the extent to which these differences in ring statistics reflect the finite system sizes under study or the more complex and more interesting dependence of the structure on the precise preparation conditions ( including the nature of the substrate ) .",
    "the ring statistics are a fundamental quantity and their dependence on sample size imaged and on preparation conditions will be an important area for future study , especially experimentally .",
    "the simplest non - trivial ( second cumulant ) measure of the ring statistics @xmath5 should be related to the static structure factor @xmath6 , as in bulk vitreous silica  @xcite .",
    "recent simulation work , in which amorphous graphene ( a - g ) configurations were generated using both _ bond - switching _",
    "monte carlo and molecular dynamics methods , highlights how networks constructed primarily from 5- , 6- and 7-membered rings may adopt a range of structures @xcite .",
    "a useful simple metric for distinguishing between the different samples is the second moment of the ring size distribution ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the mean ring size for an ideal two - dimensional network constructed from purely three - coordinated sites ( @xmath9 from euler s theorem ) .",
    "this metric conveniently captures the _ major _ changes in ring statistics from sample to sample in a single number .",
    "the values of @xmath5 for the experimental data presented in figure [ fig : rings_expt ] are 0.904 and 0.886 ( from references @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "the initial sio@xmath3 bilayer configurations are generated from _",
    "ideal _ a - g coordinates ( figure [ fig : construction ] ) , which were themselves generated using a `` bond - switching '' monte carlo algorithm ( as described , for example , in reference @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the a - g configurations generated in this manner are guaranteed to be constructed exclusively from three - coordinated carbon local environments .",
    "this method is superior to others in the sense that it produces no coordination defects or dangling bonds , and is periodic with a super - cell whose size can be chosen and varied .",
    "table  [ tab : mu2 ] lists the values of @xmath5 for these a - g configurations , while figure  [ fig : rings_expt ] shows the detailed ring size distributions for these computer generated structures .",
    ".variances , @xmath5 , in the second moment of the ring size distribution for the eight configurations studied here , labelled by the number @xmath4 of atoms in the original graphene layers , or equivalently the number of si atoms in a monolayer .",
    "the resulting bilayer therefore has @xmath10 sio@xmath3 units .",
    "also shown are the two experimentally - observed configurations . [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the difference between the bilayer and bulk bads can be rationalised as follows .",
    "the mirror symmetry relationship between the top and bottom layers of the bilayer means that ions of the same charge sit on top of one another perpendicular to the plane containing the bilayer . as a result , the ( repulsive ) like - like electrostatic interactions",
    "are effectively maximised , leading to relatively obtuse si - o - si bond angles centred about the oxygen ions which bridge the two layers , and resulting in the peak at @xmath11175@xmath12 .",
    "a simple geometric argument indicates that the presence of these relatively obtuse angles has a knock - on effect for the si - o - si angles centred about the oxygen ions which are in one of the bilayer planes , which will be relatively acute .",
    "this is an area that needs more study as there will always be a competition between the preferred si - o - si angles from chemistry and the requirements of the network topology .",
    "this effect will influence whether similar vitreous bilayers can be made from germanium and also whether aluminum ions can be alloyed with silicon ions in these vitreous silica bilayers .",
    "figure [ fig : bad](b ) shows the si - si - si bond angle distributions obtained using the harmonic and the ts potentials at the same densities as in figure [ fig : bad](a ) .",
    "the results are compared to the c - c - c bad generated from the original a - g configuration .",
    "recall that for crystalline graphene the bond angle is @xmath13120@xmath12 .",
    "the bilayer bads show a sharp peak at @xmath1390@xmath12 which corresponds to si - si - si triplets in which the si atoms are split between the two layers comprising the bilayer , while the higher broader peak corresponds to in - plane si .",
    "the harmonic and ts potentials show similar distributions which are significantly broader than the a - g distribution .    to quantify the presence of a mirror plane after relaxation , which does not impose any symmetry , we determine the variance of the oxygen atom positions ( @xmath14 ) perpendicular to the bilayer plane .",
    "the oxygen atoms can be considered as sitting in three distinctive quasi - planes corresponding to the central layer ( which _ joins _ the two original monolayers ) and the two layers above and below this central layer .",
    "table [ tab : mirror ] lists the variances for the 400 and 864 sio@xmath3 molecule systems obtained using the harmonic potential ( at two densities ) and the ts ( in the respective energy minima densities ) .",
    "the central atoms are clearly confined to a single plane while the atoms in the upper and lower layers show identical variances .",
    "the existence of the mirror plane is confirmed by determining the variance in the positions of the mirrored atoms in the upper and lower planes which is @xmath15 to within the numerical precision used . in principle",
    "the mirror symmetry can be broken once the potential contains coulomb terms etc .",
    ", as the argument given in the section _ symmetry planes _ based upon constraints does not hold with more complex forces .",
    "however in practice it seems these deviations are very small , although in principle present .",
    "we also note that this symmetry in the @xmath14 perpendicular to the bilayer plane , holds not only at the macroscopic 9(average ) level , but also at the local level between corresponding atoms above and below the central symmetry plane .    the most important results of this section , and paper , are summarised in figure  [ fig : summary ] where the flexibility windows and corresponding energy minima for the two amorphous and one crystalline sample are shown .",
    "it should be noted that the ts minima lies within the flexibility window as expected .",
    "in addition it lies towards the top , high area end , of the window reminiscent of the relationship observed in @xmath2 zeolites  @xcite .",
    "the argument given for the zeolites was that coulomb inflation in the pores between the negative oxide ions caused the sample to swell to be very close to the maximum allowed while remaining inside the flexibility window .",
    "such an argument can not be given here , as there are no large pores as in zeolites - but we propose that coulomb inflation , between the oxide ions , may still be the explanation within the rings of the bilayer .",
    "the silicon ions are less important as they are smaller .",
    "however we do not find this argument entirely convincing , and more work on understanding the subtleties of the effects of coulomb interactions in ionic framework structures is needed .",
    "note that the the high density end of the window for harmonic potentials is to the left and determined by repulsive forces between neighboring ions .",
    "the figure also shows the corresponding energy minima from the ts potential ( @xmath16 ) coloured as for the corresponding flexibility windows .",
    "the blue line highlights the experimental density range.,width=264 ]",
    "the existence of a symmetry plane in an amorphous sample is surprising and quite unlike anything that we have encountered before .",
    "this symmetry emerges from the disordered state as the network takes advantage of the larger conformational space available when a symmetry plane is present compared to without .",
    "hence symmetry is induced in a system which at first sight seems a canonical example of a system without symmetry .",
    "the argument for it is compelling as outlined here , and confirmed both by detailed atomic computer modeling and by experiment . of course",
    "the individual tetrahedral units are close to perfect tetrahedra because of the strong local chemical bonding , but these pack in a disordered way .",
    "the local symmetry of perfect tetrahedra is not necessary for the argument for the symmetry plane to hold .",
    "residual degrees of freedom in a structural unit are often referred to as floppy modes  @xcite .",
    "consider two tetrahedral units ( which we will call a _ tetrahedral pair _ ) with a common oxygen atom - that is si@xmath1o@xmath17 as shown in figure  [ fig : structure ] .",
    "there are @xmath4 such units made from the @xmath10 units of sio@xmath1 in the bilayer structure .",
    "a rigid body has 6 degrees of freedom in three dimensions , and for any two vertices of adjacent tetrahedra to coincide requires 3 constraints ( x@xmath18 = x@xmath1 , y@xmath18 = y@xmath1 and z@xmath18 = z@xmath1 , where 1 and 2 refer to the two tetrahedral vertices that come together ) .",
    "we now give counting arguments  @xcite for the case without symmetry and then with symmetry between the bilayers from a ( proposed ) reflection plane in the middle of the two layers .",
    "_ without symmetry_. consider the two separate tetrahedra in the tetrahedral pair shown in figure  [ fig : structure ] ; each with the usual 6 degrees of freedom for a rigid body in three dimensions .",
    "that makes 12 degrees of freedom in total .",
    "joining the common oxygen atom requires 3 constraints ( to make the tetrahedral pair ) and the 6 remaining oxygen ions each require 3 constraints , which are shared so that there are @xmath19 floppy modes , which is the expected result that the system is isostatic  @xcite - that is the structure just has enough constraints to be rigid and can not be moved ( subject to the usual remarks about boundary conditions _",
    "etc_.  @xcite ) .",
    "this result is expected as the bilayer is just a special case of a network of corner sharing tetrahedral units which are all isostatic  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen easily as each individual isolated tetrahedron has 6 degrees of freedom , and four shared corners each with 3 constraints - hence the number of floppy modes per tetrahedron is @xmath20 and we have an isostatic network ; that is no floppy modes .",
    "_ with symmetry_. first define an external plane and position it at @xmath21 .",
    "then move a single tetrahedron so one vertex lies in this plane but is free to move in the @xmath22 plane .",
    "this tetrahedron initially has 6 degrees of freedom , and putting an atom somewhere in the external plane requires a single constraint .",
    "the 3 other oxygen atoms require @xmath23 constraints to link the corners - the second tetrahedron in the tetrahedral pair is fixed by the reflection symmetry and therefore has neither independent degrees of freedom nor independent constraints associated with it .",
    "thus there are @xmath24 remaining degrees of freedom for each tetrahedral pair and hence a total of @xmath25 degrees of freedom for the whole bilayer .",
    "the important observation here is that with corner sharing tetrahedra , there are a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom _ if _ there is a reflection plane .",
    "this allows the bilayer structure _ to roam over a region of conformational space _ while maintaining all the constraints .",
    "this leads to a flexibility window analogous to that found previously in zeolites  @xcite .",
    "as discussed later , we find that with a more realistic potential the bilayer settles within the flexibility window at a preferred density .",
    "this is a pretty remarkable and unexpected result .",
    "the above arguments can be streamlined and made very compact .",
    "looking at the lower monolayer , disconnected from the upper monolayer , then if there is a reflection plane only a single constraint is required at oxygen that is not shared with another tetrahedron therefore a reflection plane leads to a macroscopic number of floppy modes @xmath26 .",
    "yet another distinct demonstration of this result can be given as follows .",
    "start with planar collection of @xmath4 corner - sharing triangles .",
    "there are @xmath27 degrees of freedom and @xmath28 constraints giving no remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "that is such a network ( example is a kagome lattice ) is isostatic and only flexible if there is a surface and ( o@xmath29 ) floppy modes .",
    "now consider a @xmath2 flexible framework of tetrahedra connected with the same @xmath30 topology of corner sharing triangles ( each tetrahedron has three connected corners ) , then there are @xmath31 degrees of freedom and @xmath32 constraints giving a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom @xmath33 . if further , the remaining vertex of each tetrahedron , so fixing one of its cartesian coordinates , then the total number of degrees of freedom per tetrahedron is @xmath25 .",
    "adding the reflected monolayer to the original monolayer gives @xmath10 sio@xmath1 units with @xmath25 degrees of freedom for the bilayer , as before .",
    "note that these arguments apply to tetrahedra of arbitrary shape and size , so if there are some al ions within tetrahedra in the lower layer at some composition , they should be mirrored in the upper layer based on the arguments in this sections , although coulomb repulsions between them would discourage this .",
    "aluminum and silicon tetrahedra are both nearly perfect but have different sizes  @xcite and so attempting to construct such bilayers would be something interesting to try experimentally .",
    "the situation is very different in conventional zeolites , where loewenstein s empirical rule  @xcite for alumino - silicates states that ( in essence ) every",
    "we have shown how the recently discovered vitreous silica bilayer can be computer - modeled by progressive assembly , starting from an amorphous graphene sheet , and making various decorations and then relaxation with appropriate potentials .",
    "this pathway is of course not physical , but represents a convenient way of computer - generating such structures .",
    "this system is probably the first network glass where the ring structure can be experimentally observed directly by stm and stem measurements with atomic resolution , making it a paradigm system for future study .",
    "an interesting observation is the unexpected mirror symmetry plane through the center of the bilayer , which seems to defy the logic which says that such bilayers should pucker .",
    "the fact that the top monolayer lies exactly on top of the lower monolayer , means that a single layer is seen in the experimental stem image , making structural interpretations much easier , and confirming the symmetry argument given here .",
    "this is a very unusual situation of a symmetry induced in a disordered system .",
    "although additional terms in the potential , like the coulomb terms , may result in this symmetry being broken , this is not observed in the experiments , or in the computer simulations , at the current level of accuracy .",
    "it should be noted that amorphous graphene shows no such symmetry and is expected to show considerable puckering , unless constrained from doing so by a sufficient applied tension  @xcite .",
