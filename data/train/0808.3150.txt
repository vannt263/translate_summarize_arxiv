    "<S> however , when the heavy stars are relatively rare ( @xmath8 ) , they scatter mostly on light stars , sink to the center by dynamical friction and settle into a much steeper cusp with @xmath9 , while the light stars form a @xmath6 cusp , resulting in strong segregation ( i.e. @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the present - day mass function of evolved stellar populations ( coeval or continuously star forming ) with a universal initial mass function , separate into two distinct mass scales , @xmath11 of main sequence and compact dwarfs , and @xmath12 of stellar black holes ( sbhs ) , and have @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that it is likely that many relaxed galactic nuclei are strongly segregated . </S>",
    "<S> we review indications of strong segregation in observations of the galactic center and in results of numeric simulations , and briefly list some possible implications of a very high central concentration of sbhs around a mbh . </S>"
