    "classical nova explosions occur in accreting binaries with a white dwarf ( wd ) as the primary and a late - type dwarf or giant as the secondary .",
    "hydrogen - rich accreted material is accumulated on the wd surface until a critical mass is reached that ignites a thermonuclear runaway ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the released energy and mass propagate through the circumstellar matter and are expected to form a shock structure similar to , but in much smaller scales both in time and space than , those found in supernova remnants ( snrs ) . from the analogy to snrs",
    ", we naturally expect both thermal and non - thermal emission in the x - ray band if we can observe classical novae with a sufficient agility and sensitivity .",
    "thermal emission in the hard x - ray ( 110  kev ) band from high - temperature plasma produced by adiabatic shocks has been routinely reported in many classical novae due mainly to the _ swift _ satellite ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , no clear detection has been reported of non - thermal x - ray emission from charged particles accelerated by shocks , as it requires high sensitivity in the super - hard x - ray ( @xmath010  kev ) band .",
    "successful detection of non - thermal x - rays will make classical novae another agent of cosmic particle acceleration .",
    "also , because super - hard x - ray photons can penetrate through an extreme extinction of @xmath8  @xmath1  10@xmath9  mag , it will eventually give a tool to unveil the currently - inaccessible phenomena shielded by a thick ejecta material in the initial phase of classical nova explosions .",
    "in this letter , we report the result of the x - ray observations from the classical nova v2491 cyg using the _ suzaku _ satellite .",
    "we focus on the detection of super - hard emission extending up to 70  kev , the highest energy x - rays ever reported from classical novae .",
    "the results of the remaining data will be presented separately .",
    "v2491 cyg @xcite was discovered on 2008 april 10.728  ut at a galactic coordinate of ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) @xmath12 ( 67.22874@xmath13 , 4.35315@xmath13 ) .",
    "we define the epoch of the discovery as the origin of time in this letter .",
    "the evolution of the nova was extremely fast @xcite , declining at a rate of @xmath14 @xmath1 4.6  d @xcite , where @xmath14 is the time to fade by 2  mag from the optical maximum . using an empirical relation between the maximum magnitude and the rate of decline among classical novae @xcite , in which intrinsically brighter ones fade faster ,",
    "a distance was estimated as @xmath110.5  kpc @xcite .",
    "the wd mass is considered to be on the higher end from the rapid development of the light curves @xcite .",
    "intensive monitoring both by ground - based and space - based observations revealed some distinctive characteristics of this source . in general , classical novae continue to decline in the optical brightness , but v2491 cyg exhibited a clear rebrightening followed by a sudden fading around day 15 .",
    "a similar rebrightening was found only in two other cases : v1493aql @xcite and v2362cyg @xcite .",
    "@xcite attempted to explain this unusual behavior by a sudden release of magnetic energy .",
    "v2491 cyg is also one of the few examples with x - ray detection prior to the nova @xcite with possible spectral changes among several observations @xcite .",
    "the optical rebrightening and the pre - nova x - ray activity suggest that v2491 cyg might host a magnetic wd .",
    "the onset of the nova triggered an x - ray monitoring campaign using the _ swift _ satellite @xcite .",
    "no emission was found on day 1 , but x - rays emerged clearly on day 5 with extremely hard continuum emission @xcite as well as a line - like feature near 6.7  kev attributable to k@xmath2 in our quick look .",
    "these x - ray features are quite rare in classical nova explosions , yet are important for understanding their high - energy behavior .",
    "we therefore requested a @xmath120  ks target - of - opportunity observation by _",
    "suzaku _ and obtained a well - exposed spectrum on 2008 april 1920 ( day 9.1 in the middle of the observation ) . in order to follow the spectral evolution",
    ", we requested another @xmath120  ks time on may 9 ( day 28.9 ) .",
    "the data were processed with the pipeline version 2.2 .    _ suzaku _ has two instruments in operation @xcite : the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) sensitive at 0.212  kev and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ; @xcite ) above 10  kev .",
    "the utility of the unique combination of detectors covering a wide energy range is illustrated by previous _",
    "suzaku _ studies of classical novae @xcite .",
    "the xis is equipped with four x - ray ccds at the foci of four x - ray telescope modules @xcite .",
    "three of them ( xis0 , 2 , and 3 ) are front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds and the remaining one ( xis1 ) is back - illuminated ( bi ) .",
    "the absolute energy scale is accurate to @xmath155  ev and the energy resolution is 160190  ev ( fwhm ) at 5.9  kev .",
    "each xis covers a 18@xmath318  field of view ( fov ) with an energy - independent half power diameter of 1823 .",
    "the xis2 is not functional , thus we used the remaining three ccds .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal clocking mode with a frame time of 8  s.    the hxd is a non - imaging x - ray detector consisting of several components sensitive at different energy ranges .",
    "we focus on the pin detector operating at 1070  kev with an energy resolution of @xmath13.0  kev .",
    "passive fine collimators restrict the fov to 34@xmath334  ( fwhm ) .",
    "thanks to the surrounding anti - coincidence scintillators , the narrow fov , and the stable and low background environment in a low earth orbit , the pin achieves unprecedented sensitivity in the super - hard x - ray band .",
    "figure  [ fg : image ] shows the xis image on day 9 .",
    "v2491 cyg is clearly detected as a very hard source at the center with a total count rate of 4.5@xmath310@xmath16  s@xmath7 ( 0.212  kev ) along with other softer sources .",
    "we constructed a background - subtracted spectrum on day 9 ( red and black symbols in fig .",
    "[ fg : spectrum ] ) , which is characterized by a hard flat continuum extending beyond 10  kev and a fe k@xmath2 line presumably from at 6.4  kev , at 6.7  kev , or at 7.0  kev between 6 and 7  kev .",
    "no emission in the soft band is visible . on day 29 ,",
    "the spectrum became much softer , and the hard continuum and the fe k@xmath2 line emission disappeared .",
    "the detailed results of the second spectrum are presented in takei et al . in prep .",
    "we see a high prospect of pin detection on day 9 , in which the xis spectrum shows very flat continuum emission extending beyond 10  kev .",
    "we examine the signal against the background , which is a combination of the instrumental non - x - ray background ( nxb ) and the x - ray background .",
    "the x - ray background consists of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) emission and the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) .",
    "the majority of the background is the nxb ; the cxb is @xmath12 orders smaller than the nxb , and the grxe is totally negligible with @xmath171 order smaller than the cxb toward v2491 cyg @xcite .    in figure  [ fg :",
    "spectrum_hxd ] , we compare the observed signal against the model background .",
    "the nxb model was simulated by taking account of the cut - off - rigidity history and the elapsed time from south atlantic anomaly passages during the observation .",
    "the 1  @xmath18 reproducibility of the nxb is @xmath151.8  % in flux @xcite .",
    "the cxb model was constructed by convolving the detector responses with the cxb model derived by _ heao-1 _",
    "observations @xcite . a significant signal up to 70",
    "kev was detected at a @xmath173  @xmath18 level on day 9 .",
    "the detection is also significant even when subtracting the maximum allowable nxb model .",
    "the detection is further confirmed by subtracting another nxb model constructed differently by accumulating the pin data of our own observation during the earth occultation . in contrast , no significant pin emission was detected on day 29 .",
    "we attribute the pin emission on day 9 to v2491 cyg for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the flux of the pin emission is consistent with the extrapolated flux of the flat hard continuum in the hard end of the xis spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fg : spectrum ] ) , ( 2 ) no other x - ray source with a comparable hardness was found in the xis image ( fig .",
    "[ fg : image ] ) , ( 3 ) no super - hard x - ray source is known within the pin fov by the _ integral _ @xcite and the quick - look data by the all - sky monitor in the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) , and ( 4 ) the absence of the pin emission on day 29 is consistent with the fact that the extrapolated xis emission is too weak for any pin detection .",
    "we now fit the resultant background - subtracted xis and pin spectra on day 9 simultaneously .",
    "we start with the fe k@xmath2 feature between 6 and 7  kev . we fitted the feature locally with a gaussian line and obtained the best - fit energy and equivalent width of 6.6@xmath190.1  kev and @xmath1240  ev , respectively .",
    "the detection of the line was found significant at a @xmath03  @xmath18 level both by the f - test and a monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "we attribute the feature to the k@xmath2 emission line at 6.7  kev .",
    "we further examined the presence of possible accompanying lines at 6.4  kev by k@xmath2 and at 7.0  kev by k@xmath2 , but these lines were found insignificant .",
    "the presence of the k@xmath2 line and the absence of the k@xmath2 line indicate a thermal origin of the emission by plasma with a temperature of @xmath1510  kev .",
    "the plasma at this temperature is incapable of producing the flat super - hard continuum , so an additional harder spectral component is required .",
    "we fitted the entire spectrum with two different combinations of models .",
    "the first one is optically - thin thermal plasma ( apec ; @xcite ) plus a power - law model , which is respectively for the thermal features in the hard band and the flat continuum across both bands .",
    "the second combination employs a bremsstrahlung model in place of the power - law model .",
    "these models are attenuated by an interstellar extinction model ( tbabs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fe abundance relative to h in the plasma model was not constrained well by the data , and we therefore fixed it at solar @xcite .",
    "we obtained a statistically acceptable fit for the first combination .",
    "the best - fit parameter values are compiled in table  [ tb : parameter01 ] for the amount of extinction ( @xmath20 ) , the thermal plasma temperature and flux ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , and the power - law photon index and flux ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "the extinction - corrected luminosity at 10.5  kpc was also derived for each component ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "for the second combination of models , the electron temperature of the bremsstrahlung emission is constrained to be @xmath0100  kev , which is much higher than the post shock temperature in a strong shock by the ejecta propagating at @xmath14000  km  s@xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the spectrum on day 9 is better explained by a combination of 3  kev thermal plasma and power - law emission with a photon index of 0.1 attenuated by a heavy extinction .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the nxb reproducibility for the pin brings little change in the result by about @xmath190.3  kev in @xmath21 , @xmath190.08 in @xmath23 , and @xmath1915% both in @xmath22 and @xmath24 .    llllll comp . & par .",

    "we have found the super - hard x - ray emission extending up to 70  kev from v2491 cyg on day 9 . the spectrum can not be explained by a simple bremsstrahlung model with a reasonable temperature .",
    "the best - fit power - law model is very flat with a photon index of 0.1@xmath190.2 .",

    "the rapid decay rules out the possibility of comptonization of nuclear @xmath44-ray lines from radioactive species such as @xmath45na @xcite or rekindled accretion @xcite .",
    "super - hard x - ray emission was studied in two other classical novae to date ; v382vel by _ bepposax _",
    "@xcite , and rsoph by _ rxte _ @xcite and _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "similarly to v2491 cyg , these observations were conducted a short time after the outburst ( days 3 and 15 for rsoph and v382vel , respectively ) .",

    "the spectrum is clearly seen up to 70  kev , which is not explained by a simple bremsstrahlung model with a reasonable temperature but by an extremely flat power - law model .",
    "the power - law emission from v2491 cyg suggests the presence of an accelerated population of electrons with non - thermal energy distribution .",
    "non - thermal particles in classical nova explosions are suggested in some radio observations and theoretical studies of rsoph .",
    "@xcite found evidence of synchrotron emission in a high - resolution radio interferometer observation .",
    "@xcite argued for the presence of diffusive shock acceleration based on the fact that the blast wave decelerated at a much faster rate than that predicted by the standard adiabatic shock model .",
    "our result is the first to claim a non - thermal signature from classical nova explosions in the x - ray band .",
    "the extremely flat photon index of 0.1@xmath190.2 in the power - law radiation poses a challenge to understand the radiation mechanism as well as the acceleration mechanism of electrons to produce the radiation .",
    "if the dominant radiation is inverse compton or synchrotron emission and the electrons lose energy radiatively , the electron population has a number index from @xmath460.8 to @xmath461.8 in the power - law energy distribution at injection . if bremsstrahlung emission is the dominant radiation and the non - relativistic electrons lose energy via ionization losses with ambient matter , the injected electrons have a number index from @xmath460.4 to 1.1 .",
    "these values are too hard for standard diffusive shock acceleration , in which a number index of 2.0 is expected @xcite .",
    "additional explanations , such as multiple scattering in the inverse compton process or the acceleration by magnetic reconnections , would be necessary .",
    "alternative interpretations to the non - thermal model for the super - hard emission include a multiple temperature hot ( @xmath1710  kev ) plasma with an extreme extinction ( @xmath1710@xmath47  @xmath5 ) and comptonized blackbody emission @xcite .",
    "the former is unlikely due to the lack of reprocessed emission ( e.g. , k@xmath2 ) and the fact that such a large extinction can not be realized by the typical amount of ejecta ( @xmath110@xmath48  @xmath49 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter requires blackbody emission of @xmath15  kev , which is too hot for the wd surface emission .",
    "the authors appreciate the reviewer , klaus beuermann , for useful suggestions .",
