    "it is a great pleasure for me to dedicate this article to prof .",
    "ta - you wu .",
    "i first met prof .",
    "wu many years ago , when i was an undergraduate student and he was the head of the theory group in the national research council of canada .",
    "his important contributions to physics , to the training of physicists , and his seminal role in the development of science and physics in china , can be found elsewhere so they will not be repeated here . on this happy occasion of his 90th birthday ,",
    "the physical societies of chinese mainland , taiwan , hong kong , and overseas have jointly organized a meeting in his honour .",
    "this meeting was held in taipei from august 11 to 15 , 1997 .",
    "i was fortunate to be involved in the organization of this five - day meeting , and am happy to report that over three hundred physicists from all over the world participated , including four ethnic chinese nobel laureates and a field medalist , as well as many leading physicists , especially those of chinese ancestry .",
    "twelve plenary talks and more than two hundred papers in the parallel sessions were delivered .",
    "the success of this meeting can undoubtedly be attributed to the great admiration and respect the participants have for prof .",
    "wu , which motivated them to come from afar to dedicate their work to him .",
    "i will base this article on the talk i gave at that conference .",
    "it is about the ` magic ' of bose - einstein ( be ) symmetry in the context of high - energy scattering .",
    "the ` magic ' stems from a _ factorization _ ( or _ decomposition _ )",
    "theorem which i will discussed below .",
    "the experimental demonstration of be condensation in the last two years @xcite revives the interest in this old but important subject .",
    "the condensation can be traced to an effective attraction of bosons at short distances , induced by the _ constructive interference _ in the symmetrization of bosonic wave functions .",
    "these effects are well known and i will not dwell on them any further .",
    "instead , i would like to ask whether be _ destructive interference _ plays any role in physics , and if so where does it become important . certainly not at high temperatures , where phase informations are lost , but interestingly it manifests itself in high - energy scattering processes .",
    "in fact , the presence of such destructive interference is crucial in preventing certain theoretical disasters to occur .",
    "the more bosons there are the more important this interference effect will be .",
    "i shall come back to illustrate what i mean by this with some examples .",
    "constructive and destructive interferences are often two sides of the same coin .",
    "consider for example a simple system of two particles with product wave function @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are normalized and orthogonal to each other . when be symmetrized , the normalized wave function becomes @xmath4/\\sqrt{2}$ ] . at @xmath5 , @xmath6 , producing a _ constructive interference _",
    ", which in the case of many - body wave functions leads to the effective attraction and condensation observed at low temperatures .",
    "since both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are normalized , to preserve probability this enhancement at @xmath9 must produce a depletion somewhere else , and this is just the _ destructive interference _ mentioned earlier as being important in high - energy scatterings .",
    "it should be clarified at this point that ` high energy ' means high _ total _ energy , and not necessarily high kinetic energy .",
    "large mass in the presence of low kinetic energy would qualify as high energy as well .",
    "the latter occurs in systems involving heavy baryons and heavy quarks .",
    "the second example discussed below is of this latter variety .",
    "let me now discuss two examples illustrating the importance of be destructive interference at high energies .",
    "consider first high - energy ( @xmath10 ) near - forward elastic scattering .",
    "since each loop - integration can potentialy produce a @xmath11 factor , the effective coupling constant is @xmath12 , which can be large even when the coupling @xmath13 is small .",
    "consequently at high energies perturbation diagrams of all orders are to be included , resulting in many gauge bosons being exchanged .",
    "be symmetrization of these virtual bosons is carried out by summing feynman diagrams in which gauge vertices are permuted in all possible ways .",
    "the theoretical effect of be symmetry can therefore be seen by comparing the sum with the individual feynman diagrams . as mentioned before",
    ", individual diagrams can grow with a positive power of @xmath11 , and the power generally increases with the order of the perturbation diagram .",
    "this can easily lead to the violation of froissart bound ! fortunately , in electron - electron scattering via multiple - photon exchanges , such a disaster is averted , and unitarity restored , when the feynman diagrams are added together .",
    "this is so because _ all _ positive powers of @xmath11 are cancelled in the sum .",
    "_ what causes such a magical cancellation ?",
    "_ as we shall discuss later , it is the be destructive interference .    in qcd things",
    "become considerably more complicated .",
    "explicit calculation up to the sixth order @xcite shows that , depending on the colour of the exchange channel , some but not all of these powers of @xmath11 may be cancelled .",
    "in fact , it turns out that none of the @xmath11 powers are cancelled in the colour - octet channel . instead",
    ", their contributions pile up to form a reggeized gluon @xcite , thereby using another mechanism to restore unitarity .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of qed discussed above , where photons do not reggeize and the restoration of unitarity relies on cancellations .",
    "_ why do we have this drastic difference between two gauge theories ? _ the answer can be found in the different way be symmetry is being implemented in the two cases .",
    "gluons carry a new _ nonabelian _ quantum number , ` colour ' , so for them both colour and spacetime coordinates must be be symmetrized .",
    "this produces the qualitative difference between qcd and qed noticed above , but it also makes nonabelian be symmetrization considerably more difficult to analyse @xcite .",
    "i will now discuss briefly a second example which deals with _ real _ rather than _ virtual _ bosons . in the pi - nucleon yukawa theory derived from qcd with a large number of colours @xmath14 ,",
    "the yukawa coupling constant is proportional to @xmath15 , so every feynman tree diagram with @xmath0 pions grows like @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "one might conclude from this that the theory favours the production of a large number of pions , and that high - order loop diagrams are terribly important .",
    "fortunately this is not so because in summing the @xmath17 tree diagrams to enforce be symmetry , the large amplitudes coming from individual diagrams get quite thoroughly cancelled out , leaving behind only a residue going down with @xmath14 like @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this cancellation once again can be attributed to _ be destructive interference _ @xcite .",
    "incidentally , this is a ` high - energy ' process even though the pions carry little kinetic energy because the mass of the nucleon is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "these two examples illustrate the _ theoretical _ consequences of be destructive interference .",
    "i believe these interferences also have directly observable _ phenomenological _ consequences , but unfortunately i have not had time to work them out as yet .",
    "the destructive interference phenomenon discussed above follows from a far more fundamental property : the high - energy be - symmetrized tree amplitude satisfies a _ factorization ( or decomposition ) theorem _ @xcite .",
    "this theorem allows the amplitude to be decomposed into sums of products of more primitive objects which i choose to call _ atoms_. an atom may have any number of bosons , and it differs from a feynman diagram only in that it carries the _ ` adjoint colour'_. discussions on its precise meaning , as well as the significance of this decomposition , will be postponed to later sections .    for abelian amplitudes",
    "this theorem simply degenerates into the well known _ ` eikonal formula ' _ @xcite .",
    "we may therefore think of this decomposition as a _ nonabelian eikonal formula_.    in the following sections we shall disucss these and other topics in a more quantitative way .",
    "consider the tree amplitude of fig .  1 in which all components of the bosonic momenta @xmath19 are much less than the energy @xmath20 of the source particle .",
    "in what follows the final momentum @xmath21 is always taken to be onshell , @xmath22 , but the initial momentum @xmath23 may or may not be .",
    "the bosonic momenta are always arbitrary so they can be sewed up with other bosons to turn the tree diagram into a loop diagram . in that way",
    "the formulas developed below for tree amplitudes can be applied to loop diagrams as well .    in this kinematical regime , we can approximate the denominator of a propagator by ignoring the quadratic term @xmath24 in the expression @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a sum over a number of @xmath19 s",
    ". we shall refer to this approximation as the _ eikonal approximation_. it can be shown that this amounts to ignoring the effect of recoil and treating the trajectory of the source particle in configuration space as a straight line throughout . this approximation will be used in the rest of the discussions , with @xmath27 .",
    "we shall also assume the absence of numerators for the propagators of fig .  1",
    ", so if @xmath28 represents the @xmath29th vertex , the offshell scattering amplitude for fig .  1 is given by a^*[123n]&=&_i=1^n1 _ j=1^i_j+i._1_2_3_n + & & a^*[123  n ] .. [ offshell ]    for easy reference , we shall generically refer to the vertex factors @xmath28 as ` colour matrices ' and the nonabelian quantum numbers carried by the bosons as ` colours ' .",
    "there is no implication in this terminology that @xmath30 has to be an @xmath31 matrix , nor even that they have to be the generators of any group .    for the onshell amplitude",
    ", @xmath32 leads to @xmath33 .",
    "the last propagator is absent but it is convenient to include explicitly in the amplitude the onshell @xmath34-function , thus making a[123n]&=&-2i ( _ i=1^n_i)_i=1^n-11 _ j=1^i_j+i._1_2_3_n + & & a[123 ",

    "be symmetrization of the bosons are carried out by summing the @xmath17 permuted feynman diagrams over the symmetric group @xmath40 : m^*_n&=&_\\{s}s_n^n!a^*[s ] , + m_n&=&_\\{s}s_n^n!a[s].[sum ]    the absence of a numerator factor in the propagator does not mean that the source particle can not carry a spin . to illustrate this point",
    "let us assume the source particle to carry spin @xmath41 , and a momentum @xmath42 . in the high energy approximation ,",
    "the numerator factor @xmath43 is equal to @xmath44 , so if @xmath45 is the true vertex factor for the diagram , it is equivalent to a theory without the numerator factor , but with @xmath46 as the vertex .",
    "for example , for vector coupling ( @xmath47 ) to a spin-1 particle , the effective vertex @xmath48 is proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "physically this simply says that the spin current is negligible compared to the translational current in the high energy limit .",
    "similarly , for axial vector coupling ( @xmath50 ) to a pion , the effective vertex @xmath48 is proportional to @xmath51 , so in this case ` colour ' is really spin and isospin .",
    "similar arguments can be applied to source particles of higher spins . in this way we are again invoking the familiar statement that spin is in some sense immaterial at high energies .",
    "for abelian bosons we may assume all @xmath52 , so @xmath39=a[s]$ ] and @xmath38=a^*[s]$ ] . let us first look at the simplest case , with two bosons .      in this case m^*_2&=&a^*[12]+a^*[21]=1_1+i1_1+_2+i + 1_2+i1_1+_2+i",

    "moreover , for onshell amplitudes , the result of adding two @xmath54 distributions is to produce a sharply peaked _ interference pattern _ @xmath55 , with constructive interference at @xmath56 and complete destructive interference at @xmath57 .",
    "the more @xmath34-functions there are , the more sharply peaked the interference pattern will be .",
    "for that reason we shall measure the ` amount of spacetime interference ' by the number of @xmath34-functions present .",
    "_ factorization _ persists to arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "the result is @xcite m_n^*&=&_\\{s}s_n^n!a^*[s]=_i=1^n1_i+i,[offn ] + m_n&=&_\\{s}s_n^n!a[s]=_i=1^n .[onn]it is not difficult to understand why these sums factorize .",
    "the only difference between the @xmath17 feynman diagrams is the order of emission of the bosons .",
    "when summed over all possible orderings , each boson is allowed to be emitted independently at any place along the source , hence factorization results .",
    "eikonal approximation is needed to derive factorization because we have implicitly assumed the source not to recoil in the above argument .",
    "otherwise it does make a difference whether a boson is emitted before or after a recoil takes place .",
    "the algebra becomes more complicated in the nonabelian case because the vertex factors @xmath28 do not commute with one another .",
    "the case for @xmath53 is still trivial to work out , but the combinatorials for an arbitrary @xmath0 are fairly involved , so we will be content just to state the final result here .      by adding and subtracting @xmath58\\s_1\\s_2",

    "( [ offn ] ) and ( [ onn ] ) .    for offshell amplitudes",
    ", this complete factorization leads to a poissonian multiplicity distribution for the production of photons .",
    "it enables the amplitudes of all orders to be summed up to an exponential form , thus allowing an eikonal and a geometrical interpretation @xcite .",
    "it is also this exponential form that allows the infrared divergences to be cancelled @xcite .    for onshell amplitudes ,",
    "the appearance of @xmath78 indicates for example that the photons bremstrahlung from electron - electron scattering must be emitted in the forward - backward directions .",
    "since the abelian cases are rather well known , we shall now pass on to the nonabelian situation .",
    "each onshell amplitude consists of a @xmath34-function ( see eq .",
    "( [ onshell ] ) ) , whose argument is the sum of @xmath79 s of the bosons .",
    "when a be - symmetrized _ onshell _ amplitude @xmath66 is decomposed into the sum of feynman amplitudes , as in ( [ sum ] ) , the dependence on the remaining @xmath80 @xmath79 s is of the form @xmath81 ( see ( [ onshell ] ) ) , which has a broad distribution in the @xmath79 variables .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath66 is decomposed in terms of sums of products of _ atoms _ , as in ( [ sumatom ] ) , @xmath82 additional @xmath34-functions appear in the term with @xmath83 atoms . just as in sec .",
    "3.1 , these @xmath34-functions may be thought of as peaked interference patterns produced by the coherent addition of the various broad feynman amplitudes .",
    "constructive interference occurs when the argument of the @xmath34-function is zero , and complete destructive interference occurs whenever the argument is nonzero . in a high - energy scattering amplitude , is _ the overall interference effect _ constructive , or destructive ?",
    "at least in the two examples being discussed in the introduction , both of them appear to be destructive for the following reasons .",
    "schematically the @xmath11 factors found in the elastic scattering feynman amplitudes come from integrations of the form @xmath84 . with interference ,",
    "some @xmath54 s are changed to @xmath55 s . since @xmath85",
    ", the @xmath11 dependence disappears .",
    "this shows that cancellation of @xmath11 factors in elastic scattering is a be _ destructive interference _ effect .    for qed ( [ sumatom ] )",
    "has @xmath80 atoms and @xmath80 additional @xmath34-functions .",
    "this is why a complete cancellation of @xmath11 occurs in electron - electron scattering mediated by the multiple exchange of photons .",
    "for qcd atoms of all sizes appear , leaving behind fewer @xmath34-functions and less @xmath11 cancellations .",
    "in particular , there are no extra @xmath34-functions in the term with a single atom , so that term gives rise to no @xmath11 cancellations .",
    "eventually these uncancelled powers of @xmath11 will sum up to be a power of @xmath86 , bringing reggeization to the gluon .",
    "since atoms always carry octet colour , this happens only in the octet channel , which is why the gluon may reggeize but the photon may not .",
    "other terms contain more than one atom so additional @xmath34-functions are present and some amount of @xmath11 cancellations occur @xcite .",
    "the multiple commutators appearing in an atom may be interpreted as exhibiting colour interference . to see how this comes about",
    "let us compare this with a feynman amplitude , where the ` colour matrices ' @xmath28 appear as ordinary products . if each matrix is coupled to a boson in the `",
    "adjoint representation ' , then a feynman amplitude with @xmath0 vertices is coupled to @xmath0 bosons whose total colour spreads over a wide range , a range that involves any colour obtainable by coupling @xmath0 adjoint colours .",
    "in contrast , when these @xmath0 colour matrices appear as a multiple commutator , only adjoint representation survives .",
    "the adjoint commutator may therefore be thought of as a _ colour interference _",
    "pattern , obtained by coherently adding up several broad colour distributions to yield a pattern which is sharply peaked at the adjoint colour and zero at all other colours .    it is this colour interference that averts a potential disaster @xcite in the inelastic pi - nucleon process @xmath87 in large-@xmath14 qcd .",
    "imagine using fig .  1 to describe this process .",
    "it is known that this feynman diagram is of order @xmath16 . on the other hand",
    ", it is also known that the full amplitude , obtained by summing over the @xmath17 permutations of the pions , must behave like @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "what is the mechanism for @xmath88 powers of @xmath14 to be cancelled out in the sum ?",
    "the answer turns out to be ` colour interference ' , at least for tree diagrams @xcite .",
    "a similar cancellation must take place for loop diagrams as well , but i have not yet been able to figure out how it works there .",
    "a colourless nucleon is made up of @xmath14 quarks .",
    "even if all these quarks are in the @xmath89 state , arbitrary spin and isospin alignments for the @xmath14 quarks are allowed , thus producing many nucleon resonances with spins and isospins ranging from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "it turns out to be these high - spin / isospin resonances that give rise to the unacceptably large contribution @xmath16 in the amplitude .",
    "if somehow these contributions can be suppressed in the sum , then there is a chance to obtain the right answer @xmath18 .    in the rest system of the heavy nucleon ,",
    "whose mass @xmath92 is proportional to @xmath14 , @xmath93 is @xmath94 times the pion energy in this frame .",
    "our notation is such that the @xmath79 for the outgoing pions are positive and the @xmath79 for the single incoming pion is negative . since the pions are massive , it is impossible for the sum of any number of _ outgoing _",
    "@xmath95 s to vanish , so any term that involves a @xmath34-function with this sum as its argument would disappear . as a result ,",
    "only single - atom terms survive in the atomic decomposition ( [ sumatom ] ) . however , the ` colour ' ( actually spin and isospin here ) of a single atom is composed of multiple commutators , all of them having only the adjoint ` colour ' ( meaning singlet and triplet spins and isospins here ) .",
    "this makes it impossible for nucleon resonances of high spin / isospin to contribute , and it can be shown that this makes the total sum to behave correctly like @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the sharpness of spacetime interference can be measured by the number of additional @xmath34-functions present .",
    "the sharpness of colour interference can be measured by the number of commutators around . since in every term of the atomic decomposition ( [ sumatom ] ) ,",
    "the sum of these two is always equal to @xmath88 , a complentarity exists between the two kinds of interferences .",
    "if one is large , then the other is small , and vice versa .",
    "the decomposition formula ( [ sumatom ] ) can be considered as a resummation formula for eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) , with both spacetime and colour interferences , and hence cancellations , automatically built in .",
    "most multliloop feynamn diagrams can not be computed analytically , though in the presence of a large parameter ( _ e.g. , _ @xmath11 or @xmath14 ) one might hope in certain cases to compute it approximately . even so one can expect to compute it only up to the leading approximation , _ viz .",
    ", _ the leading power of @xmath11 or @xmath14 .",
    "if such leading contributions to individual feynman diagrams cancel out in the sum , we would be left with no means to calculate other than tackling the subleading contributions , which is very difficult .",
    "that is not all , for the subleading and the sub - subleading contributions may also be cancelled .",
    "such is the case in the elastic scattering of two electrons where all powers of @xmath11 are cancelled , and is also the case for the @xmath96 inelastic scattering problem where @xmath80 powers of @xmath14 are cancelled .",
    "the atomic decomposition now offers a new way to do such calculations . since all interference and cancellation effects",
    "are already built into the atoms , or the factorization , no further unwanted cancellations will occur if we take the large @xmath11 or large @xmath14 limit .",
    "this atomic decompostion can actually be implemented in a graphical way , by making trivial changes to the feynman diagrams to turn them into _ nonabelian cut diagrams _",
    "@xcite suitable for such calculations . as a matter of fact ,",
    "besides not having to deal with cancellations at the end , individual nonabelian cut diagrams are actually easier to calculate than individual feynman diagrams .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that many seemingly unrelated phenomena can be understood by the _ factorization _ and _ interference _ effects inherent in be symmetrization .",
    "it is interesting that by taking this symmetrization early in the calculation one can produce a new and powerful calculational scheme in terms of the _ nonabelian cut diagrams_. the only approximation needed to obtain these generic and common results is to have sources to be energetic or massive .",
    "many physical phenomena seem to fall into this category , so we are hopeful that the technique and the understanding developed here can be used to study a variety of unsolved nonabelian problems .    9 contribution to the volume",
