    "the standard model of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) envisions a supermassive ( @xmath2 ) black hole in the core of a galaxy .",
    "the black hole is fed gas from an accretion disc . around the disc",
    "is a geometrically thick torus of dust and molecular gas .",
    "the disc and torus receive gas from the galaxy s interstellar medium , and from various processes ( tides , bow shocks , winds , irradiation ) that strip material from the stars that pass through this region .    the ultra - violet and optical spectra of quasars , and their lower - luminosity cousins in the nuclei seyfert galaxies , have two types of emission lines :",
    "narrow forbidden and permitted emission lines ( @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 ) , and broad permitted emission lines ( @xmath5 km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the narrow lines are constant ; the continuum and the broad lines vary .",
    "the narrow lines arise from lower - density gas at larger distances from the nucleus .",
    "seyfert nuclei come in two types thought to represent different viewing angles .",
    "seyfert 1 spectra exhibit both broad and narrow emission lines , while in seyfert 2 spectra the broad lines are absent or visible only in a faint linearly polarized component of the spectrum .",
    "the current consensus is that the thick dusty torus blocks our view of the blr when viewed at @xmath6 , but some blr light scatters toward us after rising far enough above the plane to clear the torus .",
    "the narrow line region ( nlr ) in nearby seyfert galaxies is resolved by _ hst _ imaging studies with resolutions of @xmath7  arcseconds .",
    "the nlr typically has a clumpy bi - conical morphology , aligned with the axis of radio jets , and suggesting broadly - collimated ionization cones emerging from the nucleus , perhaps collimated by the dusty torus .",
    "the blr and continuum production regions are unresolved by _",
    "echo mapping experiments use light travel time delays revealed by variability on 1 - 100 day timescales to probe these regions on @xmath8 arcsecond scales .",
    "just how large is the blr ?",
    "if the emission lines are powered by photo - ionization , then we may employ a model to estimate the size of the photo - ionized region .",
    "photo - ionization models such as cloudy ( ferland , et al .",
    "1998 ) consider the energy and ionization balance inside a 1-dimensional gas cloud parameterized by hydrogen number density @xmath9 , column density @xmath10 , and distance @xmath11 from the source of ionizing radiation @xmath12 .",
    "the calculated emission - line spectrum emerging from such a gas cloud depends primarily on the ionization parameter , @xmath13 where the luminosity of hydrogen - ionizing photons is @xmath14 with @xmath12 the luminosity spectrum emitted by the nucleus .",
    "re - arranging this equation yields @xmath15 by comparing the flux ratios observed for the broad emission lines in the spectra of agns against those predicted by the single - cloud photo - ionization models , typical parameters in the photo - ionized gas are found to be @xmath16 and @xmath17@xmath18 . with these conditions , the light travel time across the radius of the ionized zone is @xmath19 where @xmath20s@xmath21 is appropriate for the seyfert 1 nucleus of ngc  5548 .",
    "on the basis of such predictions , astronomers searched for reverberation effects on timescales of months before eventually realizing that reverberation was occurring on much shorter timescales .",
    "a compact variable source of ionizing radiation launches spherical waves of heating or cooling that expand at the speed of light , triggering changes in the radiation emitted by surrounding gas clouds .",
    "the light travel time from nucleus to reprocessing site to observer is longer than that for the direct path from nucleus to observer .",
    "thus a distant observer sees the reprocessed radiation arrive with a time delay reflecting its position within the source .",
    "the time delay for a gas cloud located at a distance @xmath11 from the nucleus is @xmath22 where the angle @xmath23 is measured from 0 for a cloud on the far side of the nucleus to @xmath24 on the line of sight between the nucleus and the observer .",
    "the delay is 0 for gas on the line of sight between us and the nucleus , and @xmath25 for gas directly behind the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shell ] ) .",
    "the iso - delay contours are concentric paraboloids wrapped around the line of sight .",
    "such time delays are the basis of echo mapping techniques .    the validity of this basic picture is well supported by the results of intensive campaigns designed to monitor the variable optical , ultra - violet , and x - ray spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "notable among these are the agn  watch campaigns ( ` http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~agnwatch/ ` ) . in seyfert 1",
    "galaxies , the variations observed in continuum light are practically simultaneous at all wavelengths throughout the ultra - violet and optical , but the corresponding emission line variations exhibit time delays of 1 to 100 days , probing the photo - ionized gas 1 to 100 light days from the nucleus .",
    "this corresponds to micro - arcsecond scales in nearby seyfert galaxies .      the ionizing radiation that drives the line emission includes x - ray and euv light that can not be directly observed .",
    "however , quite similar variations are seen in continuum light curves at ultra - violet and optical wavelengths .",
    "these observable continuum light curves provide suitable surrogates for the unobservable ionizing radiation . the reprocessing time ( hours )",
    "is small compared with light travel time ( days ) in agns .    in the simplest reprocessing model",
    ", the line emission @xmath26 is taken to be proportional to the continuum emission @xmath27 , with a time delay @xmath28 arising from light travel time and from local reprocessing time , thus @xmath29 since the reprocessing sites span a range of time delays , the line light curve @xmath26 is a sum of many time - delayed copies of the continuum light curve @xmath30 , @xmath31 this convolution integral introduces @xmath32 , the `` transfer function '' or `` convolution kernel '' or `` delay map '' , to describe the strength of the reprocessed light that arrives with various time delays .    since light travels at a constant speed , the surfaces of constant time delay are ellipsoids with one focus at the nucleus and the other at the observer . near the nucleus , these ellipsoids are effectively paraboloids ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shell ] ) .",
    "@xmath32 is in effect a 1-dimensional map that slices up the emission - line gas , revealing how much gas is present between each of the iso - delay paraboloids .",
    "the aim of echo mapping is to recover @xmath32 from measurements of @xmath26 and @xmath30 made at specific times @xmath33 . to fit such observations ,",
    "the linear model above is too simple in at least two respects .",
    "the first problem is additional sources of light contributing to the observed continuum and emission - line fluxes .",
    "examples are background starlight , and narrow emission lines .",
    "when these sources do not vary on human timescales , they simply add constants to @xmath26 and @xmath30 , @xmath34",
    "d\\tau .\\ ] ]    a second problem with the linear reprocessing model is that the reprocessed emission is more generally a non - linear function of the ionizing radiation .",
    "for example , when a cloud is only partially ionized , the line emission increases with the ionizing radiation , but as the cloud becomes fully ionized the line emission may saturate or even decrease with further increases in ionizing radiation .",
    "for single clouds we therefore expect the response function @xmath35 to be highly non - linear ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlin ] ) .",
    "the marginal response @xmath36 is generally less than the mean response @xmath37 , and may become negative when an increase in ionizing radiation reduces the line emission .",
    "the total response is of course a sum of responses from many different gas clouds , those closer to the nucleus being more fully ionized than those farther away .",
    "if clouds are present at many radii , so that zones of constant ionization parameter can simply expand , then the effect of averaging over many clouds is to produce a total response that is monotonically increasing and less strongly non - linear . such a response may be adequately approximated by a tangent line , @xmath38 for ionizing radiation changes in some range above and below a mean level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlin ] ) .",
    "observations support the use of this approximation  plots of observed line fluxes against continuum fluxes show roughly linear relationships , with @xmath39 so that extrapolation to zero continuum flux leaves a positive residual line flux .    for these reasons , it is usually appropriate in echo mapping to adopt the linearized reprocessing model , equation  [ eqn : linearized ] , with the `` background '' fluxes , @xmath40 for the line and @xmath41 for the continuum , set somewhere in the range of values spanned by the observations . in this model ,",
    "the delay map @xmath32 senses each gas cloud in proportion to its marginal response to a change in ionizing radiation .",
    "the roughly linear responses from partially - ionized clouds are fully registered , while the saturated or diminished responses of more fully ionized clouds have a reduced effect .      with reasonably complete light curves , it is usually obvious that the highs and lows in the line light curves occur later than those in the continuum . to quantify this time delay , or lag ,",
    "a common practice is to cross - correlate the line and continuum light curves .",
    "the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) is @xmath42 several methods have been developed and refined to compute ccfs from noisy measurements available only at discrete unevenly - spaced times , either by interpolating the data ( gaskell & sparke  1986 , white & peterson  1994 ) or binning the ccf ( edelson & krolik 1988 , alexander 1997 ) .",
    "the resulting ccfs generally have a peak shifted away from zero in a direction indicating that changes in the emission lines lag behind those in the continuum ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : ccf ] ) . the ccf lag  @xmath43 ",
    "at which @xmath44 has its maximum value , serves to quantify roughly the size of the emission - line region .",
    "since a range of time delays is present , described by @xmath32 , what delay is measured by the cross - correlation peak ? since @xmath26 is itself",
    "a convolution between @xmath30 and @xmath32 , and since convolution is a linear operation , we have @xmath45 the ccf is therefore a convolution of the delay map with the continuum auto - correlation function ( acf ) , @xmath46 the acf is symmetric in @xmath28 , and thus always has a peak at @xmath47 .",
    "with rapid continuum variations , the acf is sharp , and the ccf peak should be close to the strongest peak of @xmath32 .",
    "this tends to favour short delays from the inner regions of the blr ( perez , et  al .",
    "1992a ) . when continuum variations are slow , however , the acf is broad , smearing out sharp peaks in @xmath32 , and shifting @xmath43 toward the centroid of @xmath32 .",
    "thus the cross - correlation peak depends not only on the delay structure in @xmath32 , but also on the character of the continuum variations .",
    "different observing campaigns may therefore yield different lags even when the underlying delay map is the same .",
    "more refined echo mapping analyses aim to recover the delay map @xmath32 rather than just a characteristic time lag .",
    "these echo mapping methods generally require more complete data than the cross - correlation analyses .",
    "three practical methods have been developed .",
    "the * regularized linear inversion * method ( rli ) ( vio , et  al .  1994 ,",
    "krolik & done  1995 ) notes that the convolution integral , @xmath48 becomes a matrix equation , @xmath49 when the times @xmath33 are evenly spaced .",
    "if the times are not evenly spaced , interpolate .",
    "if the matrix @xmath50 can be inverted , solving the matrix equation yields @xmath51 if the continuum variations are unsuitable , the matrix has small eigenvalues and the inversion is unstable , strongly amplifying noise in the measurements @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this problem is treated by altering the matrix to reduce the influence of small eigenvalues , thereby reducing noise but blurring the delay map .",
    "the related method of * subtractive optimally - localized averages * ( sola ) ( pijpers & wanders 1994 ) aims to estimate the delay map as weighted averages of the emission line measurements , @xmath54 since @xmath55 , we may write this as @xmath56 the estimate @xmath57 is therefore a blurred version of the true delay map @xmath58 . with suitable continuum variations ,",
    "the weights @xmath59 can be chosen to make the blur kernel @xmath60 resemble a narrow gaussian of width @xmath61 centred at @xmath62 .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 then controls the trade - off between noise and resolution in reconstructing @xmath32 .",
    "these direct inversion methods work best when the observed light curves detect continuum variations on a wide range of timescales .",
    "the * maximum entropy method * ( mem ) ( horne , welsh & peterson 1991 , horne  1994 ) is a very general fitting method allowing the use of any linear or non - linear reverberation model . as an extension of maximum likelihood techniques",
    ", mem employs a `` badness of fit '' statistic , @xmath63 , to judge whether the echo model being considered achieves a satisfactory fit to the data . the requirement @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the number of continuum and line measurements , ensures that model fits as well as is warranted by the error bars on the data points , without over - fitting to noise .",
    "mem fits are required also to maximize the ` entropy ' , which is designed to measure the ` simplicity ' of the map . for positive maps @xmath66",
    ", the entropy @xmath67 is maximized when @xmath68 .",
    "mem thus steers map @xmath69 toward default values @xmath70 . with the default map set to @xmath71 the entropy steers each pixel toward its neighbors , and",
    "mem then finds the ` smoothest ' positive map that fits the data . for further technical details",
    "see horne ( 1994 ) .",
    "[ fig : faketest ] illustrates recovery of a delay map from a mem fit to fake light curves .",
    "the lower panel shows an erratically varying continuum light curve .",
    "the line light curve in the upper panel is smoother and has time - delayed peaks . a smooth continuum light curve @xmath30 threads through the data points , and extrapolates to earlier times .",
    "convolving this light curve with the delay map @xmath32 , shown in the upper left panel , gives the line light curve @xmath26 , fitting the data points in the upper right panel .",
    "dashed lines give the backgrounds @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the mem fit with @xmath72 adjusts @xmath30 , @xmath32 , and @xmath40 to fit the data points while keeping @xmath30 and @xmath32 as smooth as possible .    in this simulation test , the true transfer function , @xmath73 ,",
    "is accurately recovered from the data .",
    "the fake dataset represents the type of data that could be obtained with daily sampling over a baseline of 1 year .",
    "while this is rather better than has been achieved so far , future experiments ( kronos , robonet ) specifically designed for long - term monitoring will make this simulation more relevant .",
    "having shown that we can recover the delay map @xmath32 , given suitable data , how may we interpret it ?",
    "this is relatively straightforward if the geometry is spherically symmetric .",
    "consider a thin spherical shell that is irradated by a brief flash of ionizing radiation from a source located at the shell s centre .",
    "the flash reaches every point on the shell after a time @xmath74 .",
    "since recombination times are short , each point responds by emitting a brief flash of recombination radiation .",
    "a distant observer sees first the flash of ionizing radiation , and then the response of reprocessed light from the shell arriving with a range of time delays .",
    "the time delay is 0 for the near edge of the shell , and @xmath25 on the far edge of the shell . the iso - delay paraboloids slice up the spherical shell into zones with areas proportional to the range of time delay ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shell ] ) .",
    "the response from the spherical shell is therefore a boxcar function , constant between the delay limits 0 and @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] ) .",
    "any spherically symmetric geometry is just a nested set of concentric spherical shells .",
    "the delay map for a spherical geometry is therefore a sum of boxcar functions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] ) .",
    "since all the boxcars begin at delay 0 , the delay map must peak at delay 0 , and decrease monotonically thereafter .",
    "the contribution from the shell of radius @xmath11 may be identified from the slope @xmath75 evaluated at the appropriate time delay @xmath76 .",
    "( the case of anisotropic emission is discussed in section  [ sec : aniso ] below . )",
    "[ fig : hbmap ] shows a maximum entropy fit of the linearized echo model of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : linearized ] to  and optical continuum light curves of ngc  5548 ( horne , welsh & peterson 1991 ) . subtracting the continuum background @xmath41 ,",
    "convolving with the delay map @xmath32 , and adding the line background @xmath40 , gives the  light curve .",
    "the three fits shown , all with @xmath72 , indicate the likely range of uncertainty due to the trade - off between the ` stiffness ' of @xmath32 and @xmath30 .",
    "the  map has a single peak at a delay of 20 days , and declines to low values by 40 days .",
    "this suggests that the size of the  emission - line region is 10 - 20 light days .",
    "this is 10 to 20 times smaller than the 200 light day size estimated in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : blrsize ] on the basis of single - cloud photo - ionization models . with clouds",
    "this close to the nucleus , the ionization parameter @xmath77 would be higher unless gas densities are increased by a factor of 100 , to @xmath78@xmath18 .",
    "the  response in ngc  5548 is smaller at delay 0 than at 20 days .",
    "this lack of a prompt response conflicts with the monotonically decreasing delay map we expect for a spherical geometry .",
    "one interpretation is that there is a deficit of gas on the line of sight to the nucleus .    however , more likely this is a signature of anisotropic emission of the  photons arising from optically thick gas clouds that are photo - ionized only on their inward faces ( ferland , et  al . 1992 , obrien , et  al .",
    "the preference for inward emission of  photons reduces the prompt response by making the reprocessed light from clouds on the far side stronger than that from clouds on the near side of the nucleus . with inward anisotropy ,",
    "the impulse response of a spherical shell is a wedge , increasing with @xmath28 , rather than a boxcar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] ) .",
    "the sum of wedges has a peak away from zero .",

    "the rich information coded in high quality time - resolved spectrophotometry of a reverberating emission - line spectrum can be extracted only by fitting observations in far greater detail than has previously been attempted . here",
    "we extend previous echo mapping methods to map simultaneously the geometry , kinematics , and physical conditions characterizing the population of photo - ionized gas clouds . to do this",
    "we fit simultaneously the complete reverberating spectrum , including the reverberations observed in the fluxes and profiles of numerous emission lines .",
    "these fits incorporate explicitly the predictions of a photo - ionization model such as cloudy , thus accounting for the non - linear and anisotropic responses of emission - line clouds to changes in the ionizing radiation .",
    "we characterize a gas cloud by its density @xmath9 , column density @xmath10 , distance from the nucleus @xmath11 , azimuth @xmath23 , and doppler shift @xmath89 .",
    "the entire population of gas clouds is then described by a 5-dimensional map @xmath111 .",
    "we omit the cloud s position angle @xmath95 around the line of sight , and the perpendicular velocity components , because the data provide no useful constraint on these .    assuming that the shape of the ionizing spectrum is known , and that the time - dependent ionizing photon luminosity is @xmath112 , then the ionization parameter obtaining at time @xmath101 is @xmath113 the reprocessing efficiency @xmath114 for emission line @xmath115 depends in a unique way on @xmath77 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the reprocessing efficiencies are evaluated with a photo - ionization code , e.g.  cloudy , for chosen element abundances . to save computer time ,",
    "these are pre - calculated on a suitable grid of cloud parameters , e.g. equally spaced in @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 ( korista , et  al .",
    "results required for any cloud parameters are subsequently found rapidly by interpolation in the grid .    because clouds are irradiated on their inward faces , the reprocessed line emission is generally anisotropic .",
    "we allow for this by letting @xmath119 depend on @xmath23 .",
    "cloudy computes the emission emerging inward , @xmath120 , and outward , @xmath121 . for intermediate angles we interpolate linearly in @xmath92 .",
    "the observed spectrum is a sum of three components : direct light from the nucleus , reprocessed light from the surrounding gas clouds , and background light , ",
    "e.g. from stars , @xmath122 the direct light is @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the distance and the spectral shape is @xmath125    the reprocessed light is a sum over numerous emission lines , where @xmath126 and @xmath119 are the rest wavelength and the reprocessing efficiency for line @xmath115 .",
    "the gas clouds are distributed over a 3-dimensional volume . at each location",
    "the cloud population has a distribution over density @xmath9 , column density @xmath10 , and doppler shift @xmath89 .",
    "the reprocessed light arising from such a configuration is @xmath127 here @xmath128 , @xmath129 is a gaussian profile to apply the appropriate doppler shift , and the dirac @xmath130 functions ensure that the appropriate time delay and ionization parameter are used at each reprocessing site .    to fit the above model to observations of @xmath131 , we adjust @xmath124 , @xmath112 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 . the 5-dimensional cloud map @xmath58 can have loads of pixels , @xmath134",
    ". the constraints available from reverberating emission - line spectra will not be sufficient to fully determine the cloud map .",
    "however , once again mem may be employed to locate the `` smoothest '' and `` most symmetric '' cloud maps that fits the data .",
    "computers are now fast enough to support this type of detailed modelling and mapping of agn emission regions .      fig .",
    "[ fig : shellfit ] shows a simulation test designed to determine how well the geometry and physical conditions may be recoverable from emission - line reverberations .",
    "the adopted blr model places clouds with density @xmath135@xmath18 and column density @xmath136@xmath137 on a thin spherical shell of radius @xmath138d .",
    "synthetic light curves are computed showing reverberations in 7 ultra - violet emission lines , using cloudy to calculate the appropriate anisotropic and non - linear emissivities .",
    "the synthetic light curves are sampled at 121 epochs spaced by 2 days , and noise is added to simulate observational errors .",
    "the mem fit does not assume a spherical shell geometry , but rather it considers every possible cloud map @xmath139 , and tries to find the simplest such map that fits the emission line light curves .",
    "the mem fit adjusts 4147 pixels in the cloud map @xmath139 , 143 points in the continuum light curve @xmath30 , 7 emission - line background fluxes @xmath103 , and 1 continuum flux @xmath41 .",
    "note that the fit assumes the correct column density and distance .",
    "the fit to @xmath140 data points achieves @xmath72 .",
    "the entropy steers each pixel in the map toward its nearest neighbors , thus encouraging smooth maps , and toward the pixel with the opposite sign of @xmath92 , to encourage front - back symmetry .    on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : shellfit ] , we see that the recovered geometry displays the appearance of a hollow shell with the correct radius , and that the density - radius projection of the map has a peak at the correct density .",
    "the shell spreads in radius by a few light days , with lower densities at larger radii to maintain the same ionization parameter .    on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : shellfit ] , we see that the 8 light curves are well reproduced by the fit .",
    "the highs and lows are a bit more extreme in the data  a common characteristic of regularized fits .",
    "to the left of each emission - line light curve , three delay maps are shown corresponding to the maximum brightness ( solid curve ) , minimum brightness ( dashed ) , and the difference ( dotted ) .",
    "all the lines exhibit an inward anisotropy except .",
    "all the lines have positive linear responses except , which has a positive response on the near side of the shell and a negative response on the far side .",
    "this simulation test has used reverberation effects in emission - line light curves to map the geometry and density structure in the photo - ionized emission line zone .",
    "the 2-dimensional map clearly reveals the correct hollow shell geometry , and moreover the correct density is also recovered .",
    "these promising results suggest that there are good prospects for probing the geometry and physical conditions in real agns .",
    "because the primary aim of this meeting is to discuss ways in which quasars may be useful as standard candles for cosmology , i will conclude with a brief discussion of two methods , both relatively new , which may allow the determination of redshift - independent distances to active galaxies .",
    "both methods employ echo mapping time delays to measure the physical size of something .",
    "emission line time delays measure the sizes of regions of ionized gas surrounding the nucleus .",
    "continuum time delays measure the sizes of reprocessing zones on the reverberating surface of an irradiated accretion disc .",
    "the ionizing photon luminosity @xmath141 can be estimated from an observed flux @xmath142 as @xmath143 where @xmath124 is the distance and @xmath144 is a `` spectral shape '' factor that converts the observed flux @xmath142 to an ionizing photon flux @xmath145 if the ionizing radiation is not isotropic , the flux @xmath142 in our direction differs from that seen by the photo - ionized gas clouds .",
    "that uncertainty may be absorbed into the factor @xmath144 .    from the definition of the ionization parameter @xmath77 ,",
    "the radius of the photo - ionized zone is given by @xmath146 reverberation results allow us to measure @xmath147 from a time delay @xmath28 .",
    "we therefore find that the distance is @xmath148 since @xmath28 is measured by reverberation , while @xmath77 , @xmath9 , @xmath144 , and @xmath142 are found from the emission - line spectrum , we have a means of estimating the distance without using the redshift . for redshift @xmath149 ,",
    "the hubble constant is then @xmath150    the above results apply only for the over - simplified case of photo - ionized gas characterized by single values of the ionization parameter @xmath77 and density @xmath9 .",
    "this is intended only as an illustrative sketch of the method . in a more realistic model ,",
    "the gas clouds have not single values but rather a cloud distribution function @xmath151 .",
    "we discussed this type of fitting in section  [ sec : conditions ] .      * steady - state accretion discs . *",
    "the effective temperature on the surface of a steady - state accretion disc decreases with radius as @xmath152 where @xmath99 is the black hole mass and @xmath153 is the accretion rate . if the disc surface radiates as a blackbody , the spectrum arising from the disc",
    "is obtained by summing blackbody spectra weighted by the projected areas of the annuli , @xmath154 here @xmath124 is the distance , @xmath94 is the inclination of the disc axis relative to the line of sight , and @xmath155 .",
    "the optical / ultra - violet spectra of agns have `` big blue bump '' components that are attributed to thermal emission from accretion discs .",
    "observed spectra are generally redder than the characteristic @xmath156 spectrum predicted by disc theory ( e.g.  francis et  al .",
    "the spectral signature of an accretion disc is therefore not very convincingly demonstrated . however , observed spectra are contaminated e.g.by starlight from the host galaxy ( e.g.  welsh et  al .",
    "taking difference spectra cancels out the contamination and measures the variable component of the light .",
    "the difference spectra are usually bluer and can be in satisfactory agreement with the predicted spectrum for the change in brightness of an irradiated accretion disc ( collier et  al .",
    ".    * echo mapping accretion disc temperature profiles . * in order to map the temperature profiles of accretion discs , we need some way to measure the temperature , and some way to measure the radius at which that temperature applies .",
    "we use a time delay to measure the radius , and a wavelength to measure the temperature .",
    "the disc surface is irradiated by the erratically variable source located near its centre , launching heating and cooling waves that propogate at the speed of light outward from the centre of the disc .",
    "this effectively reprocesses the hard x - ray and euv photons that irradiate the disc into softer ultra - violet , optical , and infra - red photons .",
    "a distant observer will note that the reprocessed light arrives with a time delay @xmath157 the heating wave requires a time @xmath74 to reach radius @xmath11 , and the reprocessing site at radius @xmath11 and azimuth @xmath23 is at a distance from the observer that is larger by @xmath158 relative to the centre of the disc .",
    "note that for the annulus at radius @xmath11 , the mean time delay , averaged around the annulus , is always @xmath74 regardless of the inclination , but the range of time delays depends on the inclination .",
    "if the disc is face on ( @xmath159 ) then all azimuths have the same time delay .",
    "if the disc is edge on ( @xmath160 ) then the far edge of the disc at @xmath120 has the maximum time delay @xmath76 , and the near edge at @xmath161 has a time delay of zero .",
    "we use the blackbody spectrum to associate each wavelength with a temperature . the planck spectrum for a blackbody temperature @xmath162 , @xmath163 peaks at the dimensionless frequency @xmath164 . when irradiation increases @xmath162 slightly , the change in the spectrum , proportional to @xmath165 , peaks near @xmath166 .",
    "to map the temperature profile of an irradiated accretion disc , we measure the time delay at different wavelengths .",
    "when we observe a change in the spectrum at wavelength @xmath100 , we are measuring the reprocessed light from disc annuli where temperatures are @xmath167 with @xmath168 .",
    "ultra - violet , optical , and near infra - red light curves give time delays for hot gas with @xmath169k , warm gas with @xmath170k , and cold gas with @xmath171k , respectively .",
    "if the temperature decreases with radius , the time delay should increase with wavelength .",
    "for the temperature profile of the steady - state disc , the time delay is @xmath172 this @xmath79 prediction has recently been verified in the case of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  7469 ( collier , et  al .",
    "the observed @xmath173 therefore allows a measurement of @xmath174 , @xmath175 substituting for @xmath174 in the expression for @xmath176 , we find the distance , @xmath177 note that this distance is determined independently of the redshift of the agn .",
    "finally , for redshift @xmath149 , the hubble constant is @xmath178    the above is of course only an outline description of the method . in practice one fits a model of reverberations in an irradiated disc to observed light curves .",
    "this new method is based on fairly straightforward physics ",
    "light travel time delays to measure radius , and blackbody spectra to associate a temperature with each wavelength .",
    "the results for ngc  7496 give @xmath179  km  s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 ( collier , et  al .",
    ".    the unknown disc inclination may not be too serious a problem because at high inclinations the dusty torus should obscure the broad emission line region .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies are therefore expected to have @xmath180 .",
    "the @xmath181 uncertainty may be reduced further by applying the method to a sample of seyfert 1 galaxies with random inclinations in the above range .",
    "the use of blackbody spectra may be questioned , but can be checked by seeing if the same distance is found at different wavelengths .",
    "this test holds up for ngc  7469 ( collier , et  al .",
    "if the method can be shown to work for a larger sample of objects , it may serve to calibrate agns as standard candles for cosmology .",
