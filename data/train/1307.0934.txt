    "the properties of nuclear matter has been an area of considerable interest for the past few decades .",
    "such studies are quite important in nuclear physics , ( e.g. in the context of nucleon - nucleon (",
    "n - n ) interaction , structure and properties of finite nuclei , and dynamics of heavy ion collisions ) , astrophysics ( nucleosynthesis , structure and evolution of neutron stars @xcite , big bang cosmology ) and also particle physics ( production or interaction of hadrons ) .",
    "one of the fundamental concerns in the study of nuclear matter is the nature of the n - n interaction .",
    "this problem is solved usually in a self - consistent manner in various different approaches which can be broadly classified into three general types , namely the _ ab initio _ methods , the effective field theory method and methods based on phenomenological density functionals .",
    "the _ ab initio _ methods include the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approach @xcite ; the relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach @xcite , the green function monte - carlo ( gfmc ) method @xcite using the basic n - n interactions given by boson exchange potentials .",
    "the other approach of this type pioneered by the argonne group @xcite is also known as the variational approach .",
    "the effective field theory ( eft ) methods @xcite are based on chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the third type of approaches are based on the phenomenological models with effective density dependent interactions such as gogny or skyrme forces @xcite ( see also @xcite for a systematic analysis of skyrme models ) and the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models @xcite .",
    "the parameters of these models are evaluated by appealing to the bulk properties of nuclear matter and properties of closed shell nuclei .",
    "the rmf - models represent the n - n interactions through the coupling of nucleons with isoscalar scalar mesons , isoscalar vector mesons , isovector vector mesons and the photon quanta besides the self and cross - interactions among these mesons @xcite .",
    "although implemented at hartree level only , these models have been very successful in simulating the observed bulk properties of nuclear matter including the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , mass and radii of neutron star as well as in explaining properties of finite nuclei .",
    "recently , the rmf model has also been extended to include the hartree - fock theory and the short range repulsion using unitary operator method @xcite to study the symmetric nuclear matter .    in all these approaches mentioned above nucleons",
    "are treated as structureless point objects .",
    "however , incorporation of stucture of nucleon with meson couplings at the basic quark level in the study of saturation properties of nuclear matter can provide new insight .",
    "with such a hope there has been several attempts based on simple bag - model or some phenomenological potential models to address the nucleon structure .",
    "using such quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) models nuclear equations of state ( eos ) have also been constructed @xcite and properties of nuclear matter have been studied in great detail in a series of works by saito , thomas and collaborators @xcite and by others @xcite .    quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "is the underlying theory of the strong forces that hopefully would also explain nuclear stability .",
    "therefore the study of changes in nuclear properties due to the fundamental parameters of qcd in particular with the variation of light quark masses is legitimate .",
    "the sensitivity of the relative binding energy to the relative change in light quark masses was investigated for nuclei a=3 - 8 and computed in @xcite for different argonne potential models , considering cases including the urbana model ix three - body force , and for thorium in @xcite .",
    "more recently , ref .",
    "@xcite computed the variations in the nuclear binding of light elements like deuteron , tritium , @xmath0li , @xmath1c and @xmath2o from the changes in quark masses in a one boson - exchange model .",
    "although , there are sizable differences between @xcite and @xcite , they agree within a factor less than 2 , which can be due to different nuclear models , and the detailed form of computing the meson mass and coupling constant variations . in another study ,",
    "the anthropomorphic principle was used to constrain variations in the quark masses and fine structure constant from the abundances of carbon and oxygen in the universe essential for life @xcite .",
    "the nuclear equations of state and the nuclear matter binding energy , can also be affected by quark mass variations with interesting implications for the stability of heavy nuclei and stars .",
    "this motivates a study of such effect within relativistic models of nuclear matter such as qmc models .    in the present study ,",
    "we have developed a modified quark - meson coupling model ( mqmc ) @xcite , which is based on a suitable relativistic independent quark potential model rather than a bag to address the nucleon structure in vacuum .",
    "in such a picture the light quarks inside a bare nucleon are considered to be independently confined by a phenomemenologically average potential with equally mixed scalar - vector harmonic form .",
    "such a potential has characteristic simplifying features in converting the independent quark dirac equation into an effective schrdinger like equation for the upper component of the dirac spinor which can be easily solved .",
    "the implication of such potential forms in the dirac framework has been studied earlier by several authors @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the spin - orbit interaction is absent in such models due to exact cancellation of terms coming from the vector and the scalar part of the potential taken in equal proportonal .",
    "this is a welcome feature for baryon sector , where the contribution from spin - orbit interaction to baryon mass spliitings is already known to be negligible @xcite .",
    "eichen and feinberg @xcite in a gauge invariant formalism , assuming the confinement mechanism to be purely color - electric in character , obtained similar lorentz structure of the potential .",
    "this typical lorentz structure of the confining potential renders dirac equation solvable for all possible quark eigen - modes . due to the harmonic nature of the potential ; the quark orbitals corresponding to the lowest eigen - mode is realised here in the familiar gaussian form that makes the perturbative treatment of the residual interactions such as the short range one - gluon exchange and quark pion coupling arising out of chiral symmetry restoration in pcac - limit as well as that due to the spurious centre of mass motion in the ground state , simple and straight forward in comparison with other models .",
    "therefore , it has provided a very suitable alternative to the otherwise successful cloudy bag - models and has been extensively applied with remarkable consistency in baryonic as well as mesonic sector@xcite .",
    "taking gluonic and pionic corrections together with that due to centre of mass motion ; baryon mass spectra in vacuum had been successfully reproduced in this potential model @xcite .",
    "this model has also been quite successful in studying nucleon structure functions in deep inelastic scattering @xcite . in view of this",
    "we would like to adopt this model here to address the nucleon structure properties of nucleons and nuclear matter .",
    "corrections due to the spurious centre of mass motion as well as those due to short range one gluon exchange and quark -pion coupling would be accounted for in a perturbative manner to obtain the nucleon mass in vacuum .",
    "then the ( n - n ) interaction in nuclear matter is realized by introducing additional quark coupling to sigma ( @xmath3 ) and omega ( @xmath4 ) mesons through a mean field approximations .",
    "the relevant parameters of the interaction are obtained self consistently while realising the saturation properties such as the binding energy , pressure and compressibility of the nuclear matter .",
    "we examine the effective nucleon mass , nuclear sigma term as well as the effective quark- condensate at saturation density in comparison with the respective values at zero density .",
    "we also study their variations including the sensitivity of the nuclear matter binding energy with the variation of the light quark masses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we provide a brief outline of the model describing the nucleon structure in vacuum where the nucleon mass can be obtained by appropriately taking into account the centre of mass correction , pionic correction and gluonic correction .",
    "the mean - field properties of symmetric nuclear matter in this model is discussed in sec .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "iv . finally , in the last section , the conclusions are drawn .",
    "we choose from a phenomenological point of view a flavor independent potential @xmath5 confining the constituent quarks inside the nucleon in accordance with @xcite , where @xmath5 is @xmath6 with @xmath7 here @xmath8 are the potential parameters .",
    "this confining interaction is believed to provide phenomenologically the zeroth order quark dynamics of the hadron , and corrections , like gluon exchange can be added perturbatively .",

    "is obtained as in equation ( [ eq:12 ] ) .",
    "however , there may be appropriate correction to @xmath25 due to possible residual interactions such as the quark gluon interaction at short distances originating from one gluon exchange and quark pion interaction arising out of the requirement for restoration of chiral symmetry at the @xmath26 level as well as that coming from the spurious center of mass motion of the ground state nucleon .",
    "we next consider these corrections for the zeroth order energy @xmath25 of the nucleon core as follows .      in this model , the quark constituents are independently bound by a potential with fixed center to obtain the quark orbitals in the nucleon , which are used to construct a composite nucleon wave function .",
    "if the composite nucleon is to be considered as a translationally invariant state , its wave function must be corrected for the effects of spurious center of mass ( cm ) motion .",
    "for center of mass correction , earlier workers @xcite had followed the prescription given by peierls - yoccoz @xcite .",
    "however , here we will extract the center - of - mass energy to first order in the difference between the fixed center and relative quark co - ordinates , using the method described by guichon _",

    "the vector part of the potential poses no problem in this respect . therefore , in the present model , chiral symmetry in @xmath46 sector is restored by introducing in the usual manner , an elementary pion field @xmath47 of small but finite mass @xmath48 mev through the additional terms in the original lagrangian density @xmath49 , so as to write , @xmath50 where , @xmath51 the lagrangian density @xmath52 corresponding to the quark pion interaction is taken to be linear in isovector pion field @xmath47 such that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the phenomenological pion decay constant and @xmath55 is the effective quark - pion coupling strength .",

    "note that , @xmath116 is identified with @xmath190 at finite density .",
    "alternatively , the nucleon sigma term @xmath140 can be related to the quark condensates at low densities as @xcite @xmath191&= & \\sigma_n\\rho_b+\\cdots\\nonumber\\\\ & = & m_q\\frac{\\partial \\cal e}{\\partial m_q } \\label{sig2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath192 is the energy density of nuclear matter , which is given as @xmath193    nuclear and nucleon sigma terms versus baryon density with quark mass @xmath157 mev . ]    here @xmath194 in the calculation to the energy density from the nucleon kinetic energy plus the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "@xmath194 is said to be small at low densities .",
    "then , from equation ( [ sig2 ] ) one can obtain the nuclear matter sigma term per nucleon as @xmath195 which is distinct from the individual nucleon sigma term in nuclear matter , due to the nucleon kinetic energy and the interaction among the nucleons in the nuclear medium .",
    "now , we calculate @xmath140 using ( [ sig1 ] ) and @xmath196([sig3 ] ) at various densities with the results shown in figure [ fig12 ] and figure [ fig13 ] respectively for @xmath157 and 50 mev .",
    "the difference in the two results from ( [ sig1 ] ) and ( [ sig3 ] ) at various densities are plotted in figure [ fig13 ] . at zero density",
    "we found @xmath197 mev for @xmath157 mev and @xmath198 mev for @xmath161 mev .",
    "the experimental value extracted from pion - nucleon scattering is @xmath199 mev @xcite . at saturation density",
    ", we find @xmath140 to be @xmath200 mev for @xmath157 mev @xmath201 mev for @xmath161 mev .",
    "the sensible quantity for the stability of nuclei is the relative variation of the binding energies with the quark mass , written below for nuclear matter : @xmath202 } { { \\cal e}/\\rho_b - m_n}= k_{nm}(\\rho_b ) \\frac{\\delta m_q}{m_q } ,   \\label{vb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath203 at nuclear saturation density .",
    "the general trend of @xmath204 with the density , follows from the results presented in figure [ fig12 ] , it is negative and the magnitude increases for larger densities , as we see in figure [ fig14 ] , which suggests that compact objects could be more sensitive to variations in quark masses .",
    "we compare our result of @xmath205 - 1.02 at the saturation density with the values of the sensitivity @xmath206 for nuclei a=3 - 8 found in the range 1 to 1.5 , computed in @xcite for different argonne potential models , considering cases including the urbana model ix three - body force , and for thorium @xmath207@xcite .",
    "more recently , ref .",
    "@xcite computed for oxygen @xmath208 , and the sensitivity for other light nuclei with a one boson exchange model .",
    "variation of nuclear and nucleon sigma term versus baryon density with quark mass @xmath157 mev . ]",
    "it is to be noted here that in the present model the ratio of the quark condensate in the leading order @xmath209 are somewhat smaller than the results found in ref @xcite with a skyrme model of the nucleon and of the nuclear force .    comparing our result with the ratio @xmath210 = 0.9",
    "we find that the condensate ratio at saturation density ( low density ) essentially comes out as @xmath211 @xmath212 as found by saito and thomas @xcite .",
    "this result is intermediate between the cubic dependence found by brown and rho @xcite and the linear dependence proposed by cohen _ et .",
    "however , if we take the quark mass @xmath150 as 300 mev , we also get the saturation property with reasonable agreement with the standard values except for the nucleon sigma term . at @xmath150",
    "= 300 mev , the value of @xmath213 is much higher as compared to the experimental value .",
    "note that the quark mass at zero barionic density is few times larger than the current up - down quark masses , which was necessary in order to approach the nucleon sigma term in the vacuum .",
    "presumably , such value of the quark mass is parameterizing the complexity of the nucleon wave function beyond the valence state , which should contribute to the nucleon and nuclear matter matrix element of the @xmath214 operator .",
    "however , we expect that the typical changes in the sigma term due to the nuclear environment will be kept in more refined description of the nucleon wave function . noteworthy to mention that , although we have employed such simplified nucleon , we have obtained results for the sensitivity of the nuclear binding energy comparable with the ones found in previous studies .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the eos for nuclear matter using a modified - quark - meson - coupling - model ( mqmc ) .",
    "the properties of nuclear matter were calculated relying in a self - consistent method starting with a relativistic quark model with chiral symmetry for independent nucleons .",
    "the nucleon in the nuclear medium is composed by the three independent relativistic quarks confined by an equal admixture of scalar - vector harmonic potential in a background of scalar and vector mean fields .",
    "we computed the corrections from the center of mass motion , pionic and gluonic exchanges within the nucleon to obtain its effective mass .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction in nuclear matter is then realized by the quark coupling to the scalar ( sigma ) and vector ( omega ) mesons through a mean field approximation .",
    "several basic characteristics of nuclear matter , such as the compressibility , the nucleon effective mass and nuclear sigma term show better agreement with the experimental data than those obtained in a model with point - like nucleons .",
    "we have compared our results obtained with the quark - meson - coupling model which is based on the bag model and with the ones obtained within the non - linear walecka model .",
    "the sensitivity of the nuclear binding energy was computed giving @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) , and we found that the sensitivity rises with density , as the nuclear sigma term tends to vanish for large densities .",
    "the calculation of @xmath217 receives sizable effects from the nuclear interaction and kinetic energy , which decreases the sensitivity by almost a factor of 2 from the value computed only considering the individual nucleon sigma term at the nuclear matter density .",
    "finally , we have to mention that the model quark mass at zero barionic density is few times larger than the current up - down quark masses , in order to approach the nucleon sigma term in the vacuum .",
    "this quark mass is effectively taken care of the complexity of the nucleon wave function beyond the valence state , assumed here , which of course should contribute to the mean value of the @xmath214 operator in the nucleon and nuclear matter states .",
    "we expect that the typical changes in the sigma term due to the nuclear environment will be kept in more realistic descriptions of the nucleon , beyond the valence state , as our comparison with other models show that the values of the sensitivity are quite compatible .",
    "further implications of this model for nuclear matter and compact stars , would be taken up in our future work .",
