    "the solitons were shown to possess a high mobility and thus play a role of effective mass carriers in surface diffusion process .",
    "it is interesting to note that the highest diffusion rate is observed at the initial stages of c - i transition when the number of solitons is small .",
    "as their number grows , the diffusion rate decreases , so the coverage dependence of the diffusion coefficient is non - monotonic .",
    "this behaviour resembles the non - monotonic dependence of material strength on the concentration of dislocations : the strength increases when the dislocations are so numerous that they are pinning each other ."
