    "resonances are strongly decaying particles which have lifetimes of about a few fm / c . compared to other stable particles ( such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , etc . ) , resonances have unique characteristics to probe various properties of the hot dense matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "first , in a hot dense matter , resonances are in close encounter with other strongly interacting hadrons .",
    "these resonances in - medium effects related to the high density and/or high temperature of the medium can modify various resonance properties , such as masses , widths and even the mass line shapes  @xcite .",
    "resonances extremely short lifetimes will enable us to directly measure these in - medium effects .",
    "second , resonances can decay between the chemical and kinetic freeze - outs of the fire ball and their decayed daughters can undergo a period of interaction with the hadrons in the medium .",
    "this resonance decayed daughters re - scattering effect can destroy part of the primordial resonance yields  @xcite .",
    "hadrons in the medium can interact with each other to re - generate resonance signals  @xcite . thus measuring resonance yields and their ratios to corresponding stable particles in relativistic heavy ion collisions compared to elementary p+p collisions",
    "will enable us to probe the dynamics between the chemical and kinetic freeze - outs .",
    "third , some resonances , such as @xmath2 , @xmath17 , etc . , are heavy mesons with their masses close to baryons .",
    "thus we can study various physics topics through these heavy meson resonances , such as to identify whether the nuclear modification factor in the intermediate @xmath18 region depends on mass or particle species ( i.e. meson / baryon ) .",
    "during the second rhic run ( 2001 - 2002 ) , rhic ( the relativistic heavy ion collider ) performed au+au and p+p collisions at @xmath6=200 gev . in the star ( the solenoidal tracker at rhic ) detector , the au+au collision minimum bias trigger was defined by requiring coincidences between two zdcs ( zero degree calorimeter ) which measured the spectator neutrons .",
    "the au+au collision central trigger was defined using the scintillator ctb ( central trigger barrel ) and both the zdcs .",
    "the p+p collision minimum bias trigger was defined using coincidences between two bbcs ( beam - beam counter ) that measured the charged particles multiplicity near beam rapidity . in this analysis ,",
    "about 2 m au+au minimum bias triggered , 2 m au+au central triggered and 6 m p+p minimum bias triggered collisions events are used , which were taken mainly using the tpc ( time projection chamber ) in the star detector . +   + through the ionization energy loss ( @xmath19 ) in the tpc , charged pions and kaons are identified with momentum up to about 0.75 gev / c , protons and anti - protons are identified with momentum up to about 1.1 gev / c . the @xmath20(770 )",
    "resonance invariant mass spectra are reconstructed using the like - sign technique  @xcite via the decay channel @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath2(892 ) and @xmath22(1232 ) resonances invariant mass spectra are reconstructed using the event - mixing technique  @xcite via the decay channels @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath26 signals used in the @xmath27 reconstruction are measured from a decay topology method via @xmath28 .",
    "from the reconstructed @xmath20(770 ) , @xmath29(892 ) and @xmath22(1232 ) resonances invariant mass spectra , a relativistic breit - wigner function multiplied by a phase space factor is used to fit with the resonance signals and the resonance masses are extracted from the fit .",
    "figure 1 shows the measured @xmath20 and @xmath30 masses in p+p and au+au collisions as a function of @xmath18 and the @xmath22 mass as a function of charged hadron multiplicity in p+p and au+au collisions . from this figure",
    ", we can see that a significant downward @xmath20 ( compared to the average @xmath20 mass measured in @xmath31 and p+p collisions ) and @xmath30 ( compared to monte carlo studies which have the 896.1 mev / c@xmath32 @xmath30 mass input and consider the same kinematic cuts and acceptance in real data analysis ) mass shift at low @xmath18 region has been observed and this downward mass shift is @xmath18 dependent .",
    "these @xmath20 and @xmath30 mass shifts at low @xmath18 region indicate that the resonances in - medium effect may have already modified the resonances properties and low @xmath18 resonances have less chances to escape the medium compared to higher @xmath18 resonances so that low @xmath18 resonances properties can be more likely to be affected by the in - medium effects . a significant @xmath22 ( compared to the @xmath22 mass in",
    "@xcite ) mass shift toward low masses has also been observed in p+p and au+au collisions and this mass shift becomes smaller as the multiplicity increases while the @xmath20 mass shift becomes larger as the multiplicity increases .",
    "this @xmath22 and @xmath20 mass shift multiplicity dependence can be possibly explained by the resonances @xmath33-channel interaction in the medium which might be able to push the @xmath20 mass down and push the @xmath22 mass up based on their observed masses in p+p collisions  @xcite .",
