    "<S> within the approximation of dominant charging collisions the explicit microscopic calculations of the fokker - planck kinetic coefficients for highly - charged grains moving in plasma are performed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that due to ion absorption by grain the friction coefficient can be negative and the appropriate threshold value of the grain charge is found . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary solutions of the fokker - planck equation with the velocity dependent kinetic coefficient are obtained and the considerable deviation of such solutions from the maxwellian distribution is established . </S>",
    "<S> + pacs number(s ) : 52.27.lw , 52.20.hv , 52.25.fi    * v *    in the systems close to equilibrium brownian particles keep stationary random motion under the action of stochastic forces which are compensated by the particle friction and thus , the work produced by the langevin sources is equal to the energy dissipated in course of the brownian particle motion . </S>",
    "<S> this energy balance is described by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the form of the einstein law . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and the einstein relation can be violated in the case of non - equilibrium systems ( even in the stationary case ) , in particular in the open systems . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the classical lord rayleigh work [ 1 ] many studies of the non - equilibrium motion of brownian particles with additional ( inner , or external ) energy supply have been performed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , such studies are of great importance for physico - chemical [ 2 , 3 ] and biological [ 4 ] systems in which non - equilibrium brownian particle motion is referred as the motion of active brownian particles . </S>",
    "<S> recently the dynamical and energetic aspects of motion for the active brownian particles have been described on the basis of the langevin equation and the appropriate fokker - planck equation [ 5 , 6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of negative friction ( negative values of friction coefficient ) of the brownian particles was regarded , as a result of energy pumping . </S>",
    "<S> for some phenomenological dependences of the friction coefficient as a function of the grain s velocity the one - particle stationary non - maxwellian distribution function was found .    </S>",
    "<S> the traditional formulations of the non - equilibrium brownian motion are based on some phenomenological expressions for the friction and diffusion coefficients . in particular , it means that deviations from the einstein relation , as well as the velocity dependence of these coefficients are postulated and high level of uncertainty for the application of such models to the real systems takes place . here </S>",
    "<S> we will consider another situation , when the kinetic coefficients can be calculated exactly on the basis of the microscopically derived fokker - planck equation for dusty plasmas [ 7,8 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown that in the case of strong interaction parameter @xmath0 ( here @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the charge numbers for the grains and ions respectively , @xmath3 is the grain radius , @xmath4 is the ion temperature ) the negative friction coefficient appears for some velocity domain . </S>",
    "<S> if the charging collisions are dominant , this domain is determined by the inequalities : @xmath5 for @xmath6 , but @xmath7,@xmath8 ; and @xmath9 for @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason for manifestation of negative friction is clear : the cross - section for ion absorption by grain increases with the relative velocity between the ion and grain decrease due to the charge - dependent part of the cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a moving highly - charged grain @xmath11 the momentum transfer from ions to the grain in the direction of grain velocity is higher than in the opposite direction .    </S>",
    "<S> naturally , the coulomb scattering and particle friction related to the ion - grain and neutral - grain elastic collisions will increase the threshold for negative friction and even can suppress it for some plasma parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , the latter are rather sophisticated processes , and their theoretical description within various approximations can shadow the physics of the phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> some estimate of the influence of such processes will be also done below , but the detailed description of their influence should be a matter of further consideration . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the problem of microscopic investigation of negative friction in dusty plasmas is so fundamental , that it deserves a description of its simplest manifestation ( which occurs in the case of dominant charging collisions ) to be considered in this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> we start from the fokker - planck equation for the spherical grains in dusty plasma with typical narrow charge distribution around a negative value @xmath12 , that permits to put all grain charges to be equal . </S>",
    "<S> we also ignore the increase of the grain mass [ 9 , 10 ] assuming that neutral atoms generated in the course of the surface electron - ion recombination escape from the grain surface into a plasma . </S>",
    "<S> than , for the conditions @xmath13 , @xmath3 , where @xmath14 is the ion mean free path length and @xmath15 is the plasma screening ( debye ) length , the friction and diffusion coefficients in the fokker - planck kinetic equation @xmath16 and @xmath17 [ 8 ] are given by :    ( q , ) & = & -_=e , im_m_gdv vvv^2 _ g(q,|v - v|)|v - v| + & & f_(,v,t ) , + d(q , ) & = & _ = e , i 12 ( m_m_g)^2 dv ( vv)^2v^2 + & & _ g(q,|v - v|)|v - v| f_(,v,t ) , + _ </S>",
    "<S> g(q , v)&= & a^2 ( 1 - 2e _ qm_v^2a ) ( 1 - 2e_qm_v^2 a ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 is the cross - section for grain charging within the orbital motion limited ( oml ) theory . in this approximation </S>",
    "<S> all electrons and ions approaching to the grain on the distance less than @xmath3 are assumed to be absorbed . </S>",
    "<S> subscript @xmath19 labels plasma particle species . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of notation is traditional . to include the processes of the electron , ion and atom scattering we have to summarize the appropriate coefficients on the different type of the processes . in the case of dominant charging collisions integration in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) can be performed explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> the ion part of @xmath20 ( which exceeds the electron one at least in @xmath21 times ) is the following    _ i(q , ) & = & -a^2n_iv _ ti , + i_1()&= & ( -12 + 14 ) - 12 e^- , + i_2 ( , ) & = & . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 are the densities of the electrons and ions , @xmath23 is the error function and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the terms @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe the parts of @xmath27 related to purely geometrical and charge - dependent collecting cross - sections , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the integration for @xmath28 leads to the expression :    d(q , ) & = & 43 ( m_im_g)a^2 n_iv_ti ( t_im_g ) , + k_1 ( ) & = & 316 , + k_2 ( , ) & = & 38 ( + 1 ) .    as follows from the physical reason and directly from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , the coefficient @xmath29 is always positive . at the same time for some values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> the friction coefficient @xmath27 can be negative . to find the root @xmath32 of the equation @xmath33 let us consider for two limiting cases @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for @xmath34 eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) gives    _ i(,)=2a , where a=13 ( m_im_g)a^2n_iv_ti . equation ( 4 ) has a root @xmath32 , which exists and is small ( according to the conditions of applicability for this expansion ) only for @xmath36 , but @xmath37 : ( ) = 5(-1)3 - 1 ( -1 ) . therefore the function @xmath38 is negative at @xmath39 , if @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) shows that for @xmath40 , when @xmath41 is positive for all @xmath30 , the derivative @xmath42 changes its sign at @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> near @xmath44 the friction @xmath41 decreases as function @xmath30 , if @xmath45 and increases , if @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath47 and arbitrary values of @xmath31 eq .  ( 2 ) gives    _ </S>",
    "<S> i(,)=32 a. it means that for @xmath10 and large @xmath30 the equation @xmath48 has a root @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , for all @xmath36 there exists appropriate @xmath32 , which is the root of that equation . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is confirmed by the exact numerical calculations of @xmath32 ( fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotically ( for @xmath50 ) @xmath38 tends to zero as @xmath51 and is positive for @xmath52 . for the case of the negative friction ( @xmath53 ) the maximum of the coefficient @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> is located at the point @xmath54 :    _ m(1 + 2 ) , _ </S>",
    "<S> i(_m , ) a. for the diffusion coefficient @xmath55 the expansions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 lead to    d_i ( , ) & = & 4a ( t_i m_g ) , 1 + d_i ( , ) & = & 4a(t_im_g ) 38 ( ) ^1/2 , 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the typical behaviour of @xmath38 and @xmath55 calculated numerically on the basis of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) is shown in figs .  2 , 3 .    the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation with the kinetic coefficients ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) for the grain distribution function @xmath56 is f_g(q , v ) = cd_i(q , v ) , where @xmath57 is a constant , providing normalization @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dependence of this solution for different values of @xmath31 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to get some analytical estimates let us consider the vicinity of the point @xmath59 . in such case the integration in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) leads to the non - maxwellian distribution function , which for @xmath36 possesses a maximum at @xmath60 :    f_g(q,)&= & ( m_i2t_i)^3/2 2y_3/2(1+/2 ) ^-1 \\ { -m_g v^22t_i^ * } . here    </S>",
    "<S> y_()&= & _ 0^d^-1 + & = & ( 2)^-2 2 d_- ( ( 1- ) ) + t_i^ * & = & 2t_i ( 1 + 2 ) , = m_g2m_i ( 1 + 2 ) , + & = & ( 5 ^ 2 + 4 - 3)10(2 + ) and @xmath61 is the cylindrical parabolic function . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) is relevant , if the integral over @xmath30 converges , what is valid for positive @xmath62 . at the same time , as was mentioned above , for the applicability of the expansions ( 4 ) , ( 8) the inequality @xmath63 with @xmath64 is required . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) , ( 8) , that the asymptotic behaviour of the distribution function is non - exponential @xmath65 , but for the values of @xmath31 under consideration it is not essential for calculations of the averages , due to the rapid convergence of the integrals over @xmath30 . in particular , the average kinetic energy @xmath66 of grains is    k()= ( m_gm_i)t_iy_5/2()y_3/2 ( ) that gives @xmath67 for @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ion absorption by grains can lead to grain heating and grain average kinetic energy ( or their effective temperature ) can be much higher , than the electron and ion temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be applied to the explanation of the experimental data [ 11 , 12 ] , as it was already suggested in [ 7,8 ] on the basis of the velocity independent approximation for @xmath20 and @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider now the case @xmath10 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath69 can be represented for all values of @xmath30 with a good accuracy by the function @xmath70 $ ] that gives    f_g & = & cd ( , ) \\ </S>",
    "<S> { m_gm_i } , where d_i ( , ) |_1 at_im_g . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident , that @xmath71 given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 13 ) is non - exponential .    </S>",
    "<S> finally for the domain @xmath72 we can omit the term @xmath73 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) and the distribution @xmath74 becomes maxwellian with the effective grain temperature : t_eff = 2t_i^*1- = 2t_i(1 + 2)1- .    </S>",
    "<S> the above conclusions are in a good agreement with the results of numerical calculations of @xmath71 on the basis of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) ( fig .  4 ) .    if we take into account the processes of atom - grain and ion - grain elastic scattering the coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 should include additional terms . to estimate , for example , contribution of atom - grain and ion - grain scattering we can consider @xmath77 calculated on the basis of the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) with the appropriate transport cross - sections . for the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 the friction coefficient is    ( , ) & = & 2a . </S>",
    "<S> the negative friction exists for small @xmath30 , if the coulomb scattering is strongly suppressed , when the coulomb logarithm @xmath78 is small [ 1315 ] , that is typical for strong interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the root of the function @xmath75 is shifted to the region of large , @xmath31 , which is determined by the atom density @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the result of rough estimate for the case @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is the landau length ) gives    ( ) = 53 - 1 . </S>",
    "<S> in general , a more detail consideration of scattering processes and the effects of strong interactions between the grains [ 15 ] , is needed for the exact description of the region of negative friction .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , ion absorption by grains can generate negative friction and provide the substantial increase of the average grain kinetic energy in comparison with the temperatures of the other plasma components . </S>",
    "<S> microscopical justification of negative friction on kinetic level is presented and deviation of the grain distribution function from the maxwellian distribution is found . for dusty plasma , as for an open system , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the form of einstein relation is not applicable . </S>"
