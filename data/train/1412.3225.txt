    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence is an important part of astrophysical processes , which gives rise to global cosmic magnetic fields . over the last few decades",
    ", the peculiarities of mhd turbulence have attracted the interest of researchers in astrophysics and fluid dynamics , stimulating numerous theoretical and numerical studies .",
    "recently , significant attention has been paid to the role of magnetic helicity in fully developed mhd turbulence .",
    "magnetic helicity , together with the energy and cross - helicity , is one of the three integrals of motion in ideal mhd , but , compared to energy , the dimensions of helicity have an extra length unit , so magnetic helicity is prone to the inverse cascade and condensation at the largest available scales @xcite .",
    "the so - called catastrophic quenching problem @xcite is an example of the importance of taking into account the conservation law of magnetic helicity . in consequence , the growth rate of a large - scale magnetic field under large magnetic reynolds number",
    "is predicted to be much less than is required for cosmic dynamos . the transparent boundary and effective transport of the magnetic helicity",
    "are usually considered to get rid of the disagreement between theory and astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "the construction of the corresponding equations is still the subject of discussion @xcite .",
    "verification of such models might be possible with expected observations of magnetic helicity in real cosmic fields : estimations of magnetic helicity in solar active regions have been performed recently @xcite , and there is a possibility that magnetic helicity will be detected in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the separation of magnetic helicity into the large - scale and small - scale terms is a standard approach in mean - field models of large - scale dynamos , where the effect of turbulence is taken into account through the components of the effective electromotive force @xcite .",
    "this separation leads to the problem of correctly estimating of the influx of the magnetic helicity , generated at small ( subgrid ) scales , into the large scales described by the mean - field equations @xcite .",
    "we stress that only the numerical simulations resolving the whole range of scales seem to be capable of highlighting all large - scale dynamo mechanisms .",
    "there are a few reliable results on the spectral transfer of magnetic helicity .",
    "the role of magnetic helicity has been studied relatively well in free decaying mhd turbulence . under free decay ,",
    "the magnetic helicity of the initial field draws off some of the magnetic field energy in the largest scales . as a result",
    ", the energy dissipation follows different scenarios of decay , determined by the initial distribution of the magnetic helicity @xcite .",
    "direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of statistically stationary turbulence with a substantially helical magnetic field are complicated because they require adequate separation of the forcing scale and dissipation scale for the energy and magnetic helicity .",
    "an attempt at this kind of simulations was performed by @xcite , who showed that the inverse cascade of the magnetic energy and helicity is provided by local interactions during turbulence development and by non - local interactions in the saturated state . however , in this model , the spectral fluxes of magnetic helicity and energy were not separated .",
    "the significant direct cascade of magnetic helicity obtained can be explained by the proximity of the dissipation scale to the forcing scale .    here",
    ", we try to highlight the role of magnetic helicity by separating its source from the source of energy .",
    "we consider mhd turbulence that is stationary forced at the largest scale , with a source of magnetic helicity that is localized at a scale inside the pronounced inertial range . in our research , we focus on the possibility of a simultaneous direct cascade of energy and _ oncoming _ inverse cascade of magnetic helicity , and we examine the influence of the magnetic helicity on the standard kolmogorov energy cascade .",
    "adding an _ ad hoc _ dissipation term at large scale helps to achieve a statistically stationary state .",
    "so we deal with the dynamo processes at large reynolds numbers involving mhd turbulence effects which are of obvious astrophysical interest .",
    "studying fully developed turbulent flows demands numerical simulations that clearly resolve the forcing , inertial and dissipation scales . under a condition of sufficient scale separation , one can produce the universal behavior of turbulent transport of three ideal quadratic invariants known in 3d incompressible magnetohydrodynamics : the total energy @xmath1 and the magnetic helicity @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the velocity field , @xmath4 is the magnetic field , @xmath5 is the vector potential ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 means volume averaging .",
    "however , even recent direct numerical simulations using billions of grid points hardly provided an inertial range of scales wider than one decade @xcite .",
    "this is the reason we turn to the shell models of turbulence .",
    "these models can not take into account the spatial complexity of turbulent flows but reflect such properties of real mhd turbulence as spectral distributions , intermittency and chaotic reversals of large - scale modes ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , these models produce an extended inertial range and accurate dissipation rate using realistic values for the governing parameters ( high kinetic and magnetic reynolds numbers , low or high magnetic prandtl number ) .",
    "shell models are low - dimensional dynamic systems that are derived from the original mhd equations by a drastic reduction of the number of variables .",
    "these models describe the dynamics and spectral distributions of fully developed mhd turbulence through a set of complex variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 , which characterize the kinetic energy @xmath10 and magnetic energy @xmath11 of pulsations in the wave number range @xmath12 ( called the shell @xmath13 ) , where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the shell width in a logarithmic scale , typically chosen to be equal 1.618 ) .",
    "model equations are @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the kinetic and magnetic reynolds numbers , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are vectors in space @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the total number of shells .",
    "the structure of equations ( [ eq ] ) mimics the original mhd equations ",
    "the bilinear form @xmath23 is like @xmath24 and terms @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 specify external forces acting in the shell @xmath13 .",
    "we use the @xmath28 suggested by @xcite , which can be rewritten in a general form as @xmath29 \\nonumber \\\\ -i k_n \\lambda^{-5/2}[\\frac{1}{2}(x_{n-1}y_n+x_ny_{n-1})+\\lambda x^*_ny_{n-1}^*\\nonumber\\\\ -\\lambda^2(x_{n+1}y_{n+1}+x_{n+1}^*y_{n+1}^*)+\\frac{1}{2}(x_ny_{n-1}^*+x_{n-1}^*y_{n } ) \\nonumber\\\\   -\\lambda x^*_ny_{n-1}+\\frac{\\lambda}{2}(x_{n+1}^*y_{n+1}-x_{n+1}y_{n+1}^*)].\\phantom{xx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the non - dissipative limit , equations ( [ eq ] ) conserve the total energy @xmath30 , the cross - helicity @xmath31 and the magnetic helicity @xmath32 . for",
    "a comprehensive review of mhd shell models , refer to @xcite .",
    "the key point of our modelling is a particular forcing design to create stationary cascades .",
    "we excite the turbulence in the classical way by injecting kinetic energy at the largest scale .",
    "namely , we take @xmath25 at @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) only , in the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is constant and @xmath37 is a random phase that remains constant during each time interval @xmath38 .",
    "then , the time - averaged energy injection rate becomes @xmath39 , and the injection rates of the kinetic helicity and cross - helicity vanish under the condition that @xmath38 is shorter than the large - scale turnover time .",
    "the magnetic forces @xmath26 and @xmath27 are introduced to simulate the source and sink of magnetic helicity , acting at shells @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . for magnetic helicity injection , the force is taken as @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "then , the injection rate for magnetic helicity is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the relative magnetic helicity .",
    "we note here that the force ( [ eq.f1 ] ) does not change the magnetic energy and becomes zero for marginal values @xmath46 .    to produce an stationary inverse cascade of magnetic helicity and avoid its accumulation at the largest scale , we introduce a large - scale sink of the magnetic helicity as an additional dissipation @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "this gives magnetic energy dissipation with a rate @xmath49 and magnetic helicity dissipation with a rate @xmath50 . in the non - helical case ( @xmath51 ) , this dissipation tends to zero .",
    "the force ( [ eq.f3 ] ) imitate in the shell model the real open boundary condition typical for astrophysical objects with cosmic magnetic field .",
    "our reference case of simulations is stationary forced mhd turbulence without injection of magnetic helicity .",
    "we numerically evolve equations  ( [ eq ] ) for @xmath52 and use amplitude @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the force ( [ eq.f0 ] ) , which provides the energy injection rate @xmath55 at the scale @xmath34 . the corresponding spectrum and spectral flux of the total energy are shown in figure  [ spec1 ] .",

    "the injected magnetic helicity is transferred toward scales larger than @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the magnetic helicity spectral flux @xmath60 is negative . to achieve the stationary state of turbulence , we remove the magnetic helicity at @xmath34 ( @xmath69 ) using force ( [ eq.f3 ] ) with @xmath70 .",
    "this value of @xmath71 is sufficient to keep balance of the injection and dissipation rates of magnetic helicity @xmath72 for any @xmath73 .",
    "figure  [ spec1](a ) shows a stable inverse cascade of magnetic helicity with almost constant spectral flux @xmath60 for different values of @xmath73 , which do not noticeably influence the direct cascade of energy characterized by positive energy flux @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ spec1](b ) shows that the helicity injection does not change the energy spectrum , except for a small bump near @xmath68 .    to emphasis the bump , we present in figure  [ spec1a](a ) the compensated spectra of the total , kinetic and magnetic energies separately for the helical case .",
    "the non - helical spectrum is close to horizontal , which corresponds to kolmogorov s power law with exponent @xmath74 .",
    "increasing @xmath73 leads to an increase of @xmath60 and to the growth of relative magnetic helicity @xmath75 over the whole spectrum , as is shown in figure  [ spec1a](b ) .",
    "however , a more intensive injection than @xmath64 does not change the situation because @xmath76 reaches the limit equal to unity and the forcing is saturated . in this saturated state , the spectral slope at wave numbers smaller than @xmath68 tends to the @xmath0 power law .",
    "recall that there is energy injection at @xmath68 and the corresponding scale is rather far from the energy forcing scale and the dissipation scale .",
    "the physics behind this bump should be explained by local distortion caused by pure magnetic helicity injection .",

    "the viscous suppression of small - scale modes removes some triads from non - linear interaction and makes the spectral energy transfer less efficient , which leads to a pileup of energy at the end of the inertial range of scales .",
    "note that in shell models this effect could be reproduced by using a non - local model that includes interactions of remote shells @xcite .",
    "( a )    ( b )    , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 vs the wave number @xmath81 for the non - helical case @xmath62 ( a ) and helical case @xmath64 ( b).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 vs the wave number @xmath81 for the non - helical case @xmath62 ( a ) and helical case @xmath64 ( b).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we suggest that the effect of the magnetic helicity on the energy spectrum could be clarified by considering energy transfers between kinetic and magnetic field modes of different scales . shell - to - shell energy transfer in magnetohydrodynamics has been suggested and considered in frame of dns by @xcite .",
    "an analogous formalism had been derived in terms of shell models @xcite . instead of shell - to - shell transfers ,",
    "we prefer to use the spectral fluxes as defined by @xcite : @xmath82 where each @xmath83 denotes the spectral energy flux from @xmath84 to @xmath85 . in the flux notation",
    "the subscripts @xmath13 has been dropped for convenience , e.g. @xmath83 is a function of @xmath13 and must be understood as @xmath86 .",
    "definitions ( [ fluxes ] ) satisfy the total energy conservation condition so that @xmath87 figure  [ 4fluxes ] shows these four components of the energy flux ( [ fluxes ] ) for the non - helical and helical cases . for non - helical turbulence ( see figure  [ 4fluxes](a ) ) the term @xmath80 is negligible with respect to other three , which are constant over the inertial range .",
    "injection of the magnetic helicity results in the negative flux @xmath80 ( see figure  [ 4fluxes](b ) ) .",
    "@xmath80 has a minimum near @xmath68 and scales as @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "thus the flux of magnetic helicity is necessary associated with the inverse flux of magnetic energy , that is described by @xmath80 . since the total energy flux through any wave number inside the inertial range must be constant , fluxes @xmath90 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 compensate for the drop caused by @xmath80 .",
    "one can see the corresponding growth of these fluxes at @xmath68 in figure  [ 4fluxes](b ) .",
    "this growth is provided by intensification of the kinetic and magnetic fields near @xmath68 . as a consequence , a bump forms in the energy spectrum .",
    "note that all the above results were obtained for positive @xmath73 , which provide an injection of positive magnetic helicity only .",
    "changing of the sign does not affect the results , except for the sign of the magnetic helicity spectral flux .",
    "@xmath60 for @xmath91 becomes positive corresponding to an inverse ( negative ) cascade of negative helicity .",
    "finally we address the question of what happens if the small - scale source of magnetic helicity produces a fluctuating magnetic helicity injection , being zero averaged over time . to examine this case",
    ", we introduce a force that injects magnetic helicity in an alternating manner .",
    "namely the sign of the injected helicity corresponds to the actual value of magnetic helicity .",
    "this can be done by modifying force ( [ eq.f1 ] ) via multiplying by @xmath76 so that @xmath92 the injection rate , caused by this force , is @xmath93 .",
    "the resulting energy spectrum and magnetic helicity flux are shown in figure  [ fig : e1](a ) .",
    "one can see that the effect is similar to that obtained with the force ( [ eq.f1 ] ) , which injects magnetic helicity of fixed sign .",
    "the particularity of the result is that the averaged helicity spectrum ( see figure  [ fig : e1](b ) ) does not differ from the spectrum for the non - helical case ( compare black and red curves ) .",
    "as expected , the force ( [ eq.f7 ] ) just amplifies the amplitude of the magnetic helicity fluctuation and increases the characteristic time between the changes in its sign .",
    "the time during which the magnetic helicity has the same sign becomes sufficient to initiate the inverse cascade .",
    "recall that injected negative helicity cascades to large scales under a positive spectral flux .",
    "however , the flux @xmath80 is negative anyway .",
    "so we have found a situation in which any characteristics of the magnetic helicity does not reveal the inverse cascade ( the spectral distribution of both magnetic helicity and its flux do not change ) , while the associated flux of magnetic energy can be detected , namely by the contribution to the energy flux , provided by the term @xmath80 .",

    "in fully developed mhd turbulence , a source of magnetic helicity at small scale provides a negative spectral flux , which coexists with the direct energy flux in the inertial range . near the scale of helicity injection",
    "a bottleneck - like effect appears , which leads to a local reduction of the spectral slope .",
    "we found that the key quantity for understanding this effect is the magnetic - to - magnetic energy spectral flux .",
    "this flux , being negligible in the non - helical case , is negative and clearly associated with an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity independent of the sign of the injected helicity .",
    "the same effect can be obtained even for an alternating source of small - scale magnetic helicity with a zero - mean injection rate . in spite of the rather special conditions in our modelling , a similar scenario to some extend can develop in realistic situations , e.g. magnetic helicity injection into the corona in emerging active regions @xcite .",
    "the physical implications of the simulations presented in the paper are the following reasoning about the large - scale dynamo mechanism .",
    "mirror symmetry breaking of magnetic field fluctuations at small scales initiates an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity .",
    "this leads necessarily to a magnetic energy spectral flux from small scales to large scales , which consequently causes the growth of a large - scale magnetic field in the kinematic dynamo regime .",
    "the large - scale magnetic energy becomes saturated when the inverse spectral fluxes of the magnetic energy and helicity are compensated by corresponding outflows at the largest scale .",
    "figure  [ fig : e4 ] shows that the reduction of a large - scale dissipative force ( [ eq.f3 ] ) results in accumulation of magnetic energy at large scales .",
    "we believe that this qualitative scenario was implicitly assumed in earlier studies .",
    "however , we have succeeded in demonstrating the scenario for the developed mhd turbulence , with an extended inertial range , using a model based on local interactions of scales .",
    "we note that mixing of local and nonlocal interactions is not avoidable even in the recent large - scale dynamo simulations due to a lack of resolution .",
    "actually , we have posed the problem of the realisability of a large - scale dynamo in terms of the efficiency of mode interactions , which provide a magnetic - to - magnetic inverse energy spectral flux and emphatically recommend this for consideration .",
    "in addition , we have found that the magnetic helicity injection in the alternating manner ( being zero averaged in time ) plays the same role .",
    "apparently the mechanism considered for the magnetic energy condensation at large scale can be interpreted as the fluctuating magnetic @xmath97-effect , which allows the large - scale dynamo to persist at values of the reynolds numbers relevant for astrophysical conditions .",
    "in contrast to the dynamo recently suggested by @xcite , which was also obtained for a large - scale magnetic field at large @xmath18 , our dynamo model does not contain any shear - like terms nor kinetic helicity forcing .",
    "the result obtained is important for the theory of astrophysical dynamos , showing that a large - scale dynamo can be affected by the magnetic helicity generated at small scales . in particular , it means that for mean - field dynamo models one should consider the possible flux of magnetic helicity from small ( subgrid ) scales .",
    "note , that this contribution by small - scale turbulence for a large - scale dynamo can be described by multi - scale models , which use mean - field equations for the large scales and shell equations for the small scales @xcite .",
