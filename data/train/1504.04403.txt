    "it is increasingly important to develop an improved understanding of collective processes and the nonlinear dynamics of intense charged particle beam systems .",
    "while there has been considerable progress in three - dimensional numerical and analytical investigations of the nonlinear vlasov - maxwell equations describing intense beam propagation , there is also considerable interest in the development and application of simplified one - dimensional kinetic models to describe the longitudinal nonlinear dynamics of long coasting beams @xcite in linear ( linac ) or large - major - radius ring geometries .",

    "the weakly nonlinear analysis in ref.@xcite showed that disturbances moving near the sound speed evolve according to the korteweg - devries ( kdv ) equation @xcite .",
    "the classical kdv equation , which arises in several areas of nonlinear physics in which there are cubic dispersive corrections to sound - wave - like signal propagation , also has the appealing feature that it s exactly solvable using inverse scattering techniques .",
    "while the analysis in ref.@xcite reveals many interesting properties of the nonlinear evolution of longitudinal disturbances in intense charged particle beams , it is restricted to the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "in the present analysis , we remove the restriction to the weakly nonlinear regime , and make use of the 1d kinetic model developed in ref.@xcite , allowing for moderate to large - amplitude modulation in the charge density of the beam particles .",
