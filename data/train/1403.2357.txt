    "lattice boltzmann methods ( lbm ) has been matured as an advantageous method for computational fluid dynamics during past three decades@xcite .",
    "a lattice boltzmann system can be understood as a mathematical model involving a system of many particles , similar to that of the classical boltzmann kinetic theory but involving only a discrete set of particle velocity values .",
    "there are two fundamental dynamical processes in a lattice boltzmann model , namely , advection and collision .",
    "the collision allows particles to interact locally and to relax to a desired equilibrium distribution .",
    "the most popular model used for the collision process is the so called bgk operator involving only a single relaxation time parameter@xcite .",
    "although the bgk has enjoyed many advantages and successes , one of the apparent drawbacks is that all its transport coefficients , such as viscosity and thermal conductivity , are equal ( subject to a constant scaling factor ) , resulting in unit prandtl number .",
    "there have been various attempts in the past to extend the collision process by introducing more than one tunable relaxation parameter@xcite in a generic linearized collision matrix form@xcite .",
    "however , the outcome have been a mixed one .",
    "these extensions are able to allow a variable prandtl number , however they all suffer from generating a spurious non - galilean invariant term ( proportional to mach number ) whenever prandtl number is not unity . obviously such a spurious term is neither present in the physical thermohydrodynamics@xcite , nor in the lattice boltzmann models with the bgk collision operator .    in this paper",
    "we analytically describe the underlying origin of the problem that has plagued existing lattice boltzmann models with multiple relaxation times@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we present a new theoretical procedure for formulating a collision operator that avoids such a problem . consequently , the resulting thermohydrodynamic system with an an arbitrary prandtl number will not contain aforementioned non - galilean invariant artifact .",
    "the theoretical framework of the new formulation is based on projecting the collision operator onto an orthogonal moment basis of hermite tensor polynomials , according to that presented in previous studies@xcite .",
    "however , unlike its predecessors in which the collision operator realizes moment fluxes in the absolute reference frame ( i.e. , a reference frame in which the lattice is at rest ) , the new formulation enforces conditions on moment fluxes in a relative reference frame with respect to the local fluid velocity@xcite .",
    "most distinctly , the new formulation ensures the non - equilibrium moment flux for thermal energy ( temperature ) in the relative reference frame as an eingen - vector of the collision operator .",
    "collision operators constructed in accordance to these conditions will not suffer from the aforementioned non - galilean artifact .",
    "in particular , an explicit analytical form of such a collision operator based on leading order hermite polynomials is proposed that admits two independently controllable parameters , one for viscosity and another for thermal diffusivity@xcite .",
    "we analytically show that the correct thermohydrodynamic equations are obtained for an arbitrary prandtl number without the previously known spurious term .",
    "in addition , a numerical verification analysis is carried out for a simple benchmark case to demonstrate the consequence .",
    "a standard lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) is conventionally expressed in the form below@xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle distribution function for velocity value @xmath2 at @xmath3 . here",
    "the so called lattice units convention is adopted in which @xmath4 .",
    "the fundamental hydrodynamic ( conserved ) moments are constructed out of @xmath1 by summing over all the particle discrete velocity values @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and constant @xmath8 is the dimension of particle velocity space ( depending on the choice of a lattice type ) .",
    "macroscopic quantities @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 denote mass density , fluid velocity and temperature at @xmath3 in a fluid system , respectively . in eqn.([eqn1 ] ) , @xmath12 represents a collision process among particles . for a lattice boltzmann model with thermodynamic degree of freedom , conservation of energy",
    "is imposed along with that for mass and momentum , so that , @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath2 , or @xmath15 .",
    "( note that we only considered particle kinetic energy for an ideal gas system ) .",
    "in addition to obeying the conservation laws , a collision process drives a lattice boltzmann system to a desired local equilibrium at some appropriate relaxation rate(s ) .",
    "symbolically , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the local equilibrium distribution function , and it gives the same values as @xmath18 for the three conserved hydrodynamic moments , eqn.([moments ] ) .",
    "most commonly the equilibrium distribution @xmath17 is given as a polynomial function of @xmath19 , @xmath10 and @xmath20@xcite . without affecting the discussions thereafter and for simplicity , we choose the following explicit form @xmath21   \\label{feq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be understood as an expansion of the asympototic exponential form@xcite , @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath23 . in the above , the weighting factor @xmath24 satisfies a set of generic conditions on moment tensors ( valid for all lattice types and lattice boltzmann models)@xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath27-th order kronecker delta function tensor ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for recovering correct thermohydrodynamics , @xmath284 , and terms up to @xmath29 in eqn.([feq ] ) need to be retained@xcite .    for a fluid in the newtonian flow regime in which deviations from local equilibrium are small",
    ", one may formally represent @xmath12 in a linearized form@xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the collision matrix . to define a fully closed mathematical description , an explicit form for @xmath31",
    "must be provided that satisfy some essential properties , such as conservation laws , symmetry , as well as relaxation to the equilibrium .",
    "the simplest of such an explicit form of the collision matrix is the so called `` bgk '' model@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a standard kronecker delta function . here",
    "the scalar @xmath34 is the only relaxation time responsible for all transport coefficients .",
    "obviously the resulting prandtl number @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is unity .",
    "one of the earliest attempts to construct an explicit collision operator for a variable prandtl number was made nearly two decades ago@xcite , in that a set of fundamental conditions was presented in terms of the following eigen - value relations , @xmath37 corresponding to the moments of fluid momentum and energy fluxes , respectively .",
    "obviously these eigen - value relations are trivially satisfied by the bgk collision model and @xmath38 .",
    "it is a straightforward algebra to show that the resulting viscosity and the thermal conductivity are directly related to these two eigen values , @xmath39 where @xmath40 . the ratio of viscosity and thermal conductivity defines the so called prandtl number , @xmath41 more recently the eigen - value based concept was made more theoretically systematic through expansions in moment space spanned by the hermite polynomials@xcite , briefly described below @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the standard @xmath27-th order ( `` discretized '' ) hermite polynomial@xcite .",
    "notice that the summation in eqn.([collh ] ) starts from @xmath45 because of the conservation laws . a more explicit expression of eqn.([collh ] ) for terms up to @xmath46",
    "is given below , @xmath47     \\label{collh2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath48 being the non - equilibrium momentum and energy flux tensors , respectively .",
    "the sign `` @xmath49 '' in eqn.([collh2 ] ) is a short notation for the contraction operation between two tensors into a scalar .",
    "note in eqn.([collh2 ] ) , we have renamed @xmath50 to @xmath51 and @xmath52 to @xmath53 because of their direct connections to viscosity and thermal conductivity . due to orthogonality of the hermite polynomials , collision matrix in eqn.([collh2 ] ) ( and in eqn.([collh ] ) ) fully satisfies the eigen - value relations eqn.([eigen ] ) , so that it directly leads to the resulting eqn.([transp ] ) for transport coefficients@xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the first part in eqn.([collh2 ] ) , associated with the momentum flux tensor was discovered earlier@xcite .    the theoretical analysis and the results presented above are clear and generally applicable for all conventional lattice boltzmann models .",
    "however , there has been one well known problem as pointed out in the previous section , the collision models with multiple relaxation times formulated in this existing framework contain a spurious non - galilean invariant term in the resulting energy equation whenever the prandtl number is not unity .",
    "as we shall explain in this section , the root cause of the non - galilean invariance problem is the representation of the collision operator based on the velocity moments in the absolute reference frame . from the continuum kinetic theory@xcite , we know that the fundamental hydrodynamic quantities are related to the conserved moments defined in the relative reference frame with respect to the local fluid velocity @xmath10 . for instance",
    ", the temperature is a local root - mean - square of the particle relative velocity values , @xmath54 this in turn indicates that their corresponding moment fluxes must also be in accordance to the relative reference frame representation@xcite .",
    "therefore , the central task in formulating a `` hydrodynamically correct '' collision operator in the lattice boltzmann models is to comply with such a fundamental requirement .",
    "the non - equilibrium momentum and energy tensor fluxes in the relative reference frame are defined as , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the relative particle velocity with respect to the local fluid velocity @xmath57 .",
    "the energy flux vector in the relative reference frame is thus obtained from contracting the 3rd order tensor @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 . in the above equation ,",
    "greek indices denote tensor components in cartesian coordinates , and the summation convention is adopted for repeated greek indices .    due to the conservation laws",
    ", we easily see that the two non - equilibrium momentum fluxes ( eqn.([fluxes ] ) and eqn.([noneqfluxes ] ) ) from the absolute and the relative reference frames are identical . in order words ,",
    "the non - equilibrium momentum flux is invariant no matter it is in the absolute or the relative reference frame . @xmath61 in contrast , however , the non - equilibrium energy flux vectors in the two reference frames are different , and are related according to @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the familiar non - equilibrium energy flux vector in the absolute reference frame .",
    "this non - invariance in non - equilibrium energy flux between the absolute and relative frames is the leading cause for the non - galilean invariance artifact in resulting thermohydrodynamics for a non - unity prandtl number .    for recovering the right thermohydrodynamics from a lattice boltzmann model with a variable prandtl number ,",
    "the key step is to construct a collision operator which ensures the conservation laws as well as thermohydrodynamic fluxes in the relative reference frame .",
    "a set of fundamental conditions required for such a collision operator is given below , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , or @xmath67 , and @xmath68 \\label{fcolli}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , eqn.([consvr ] ) is automatically satisfied by a lattice boltzmann model ( eqn.([consv ] ) ) .",
    "on the contrary , eqn.([fcolli ] ) is not at all guaranteed from its counter part in the absolute reference frame .",
    "in fact , one can verify that a collision operator admitting the original absolute reference frame based eigen - value relations , eqn.([eigen ] ) , leads to a different result for energy flux below , @xmath69 recall eqn.([qrelation ] ) , we see that the eqn.([wrong ] ) is not equal to eqn.([fcolli ] ) unless @xmath70 .",
    "also we can realize that the bgk collision operator trivially satisfies all these moment conditions in both reference frames .",
    "fundamental conditions , eqn.([fcolli ] ) , can also be casted in the form of the collision matrix @xmath31 , for momentum and energy fluxes in the relative reference frame into the following eigen - value relations ( as compared to eqn.([eigen ] ) ) @xmath71 formally understood to be valid when projected onto the space spanned by @xmath72 .    in compliance with the relations in eqns.([consvr]-[fcolli ] ) , we construct a collision operator , for example , with the following explicit form : @xmath73     \\label{collh2r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the above collision form is identical to the previous form , eqn.([collh2 ] ) , except that the 3rd order moment tensor @xmath74 is replaced by @xmath75 .",
    "the symmetric 3rd order moment tensor @xmath75 is defined as , @xmath76   \\label{wtensor}\\ ] ] where the scalar @xmath77 . using the fundamental lattice isotropy conditions eqn.([iso ] ) , the proof for eqn.([collh2r ] ) satisfying the conditions eqns.([consvr])-([fcolli ] ) ( and eqn.([eigenr ] ) ) is a straightforward algebra , and is not presented here .",
    "one essential feature to be mentioned about the new collision operator is that , unlike the standard hermite moment expansion in eqn.([collh ] ) ( and in eqn.([collh2 ] ) ) , the exact parity between each hermite basis function @xmath44 and its coefficient @xmath78 ( moment of the same @xmath44 ) is no longer held by eqn.([collh2r ] ) .",
    "the new coefficient is a function that also includes appropriate other ( lower order ) hermite moments .",
    "recovery of the correct thermohydrodynamics for arbitrary prandtl numbers by the new collision operator form is theoretically shown in appendix a.      the new theoretical formulation addresses thermal fluid flows in general . but in order to demonstrate the consequence , we have performed a numerical simulation of representative case in the linearized hydrodynamic regime using a two - dimensional 37 speed lattice model@xcite , corresponding to a ninth - order accurate gauss - hermite quadrature .",
    "we have employed fourth order hermite expansion of maxwellian distribution for equilibrium@xcite for accurate thermohydrodynamic representation .",
    "we perform a simple flow simulation with the following initial conditions , @xmath79 ; \\quad n = 2\\pi / l_x\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a sinusoidal perturbation is given to the temperature on top of the lattice temperature @xmath80 , which satisfies the isotropy condition given by eqn.([iso ] ) .",
    "an inverse perturbation is given to the density to maintain the pressure ( @xmath81 ) approximately constant to avoid any acoustic modes . in order to exemplify the difference between the two collision models , we introduce a translational velocity @xmath82 ( constant in space and time ) to mimic a flow in a moving reference frame .",
    "a velocity shear is also added , which will result in non - zero momentum flux tensor @xmath83 .",
    "the amplitude of the perturbations are kept at @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the mean density @xmath86 is kept at one .",
    "all simulations are carried out in one dimensional grid , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , as there are no variations along the y - axis .",
    "under such an initial condition the temperature diffusion of the perturbation follows a simple exponential decay , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the thermal diffusivity at mean temperature and density , @xmath91 obviously , such a decay rate for a galilean invariant model should be independent of the translational velocity value @xmath82 .",
    "the simulations are carried out for different prandtl numbers and translational velocity values for both previous collision model@xcite , eqn.([collh2 ] ) , and current collision model eqn.([collh2r ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "a small fixed viscosity value , @xmath92 , corresponding to @xmath93 is used for all the simulations .",
    "different thermal diffusivity values are chosen to get the prandtl number values ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 .",
    "figure 1 shows the ratio of the resulting thermal diffusivity from the simulation to the theoretical diffusivity @xmath94 , for different translational velocity values .",
    "one can see that the previous collision model exhibits an apparent non - galilean invariant behavior in thermal diffusivity at non - unity prandtl numbers , while the new model largely removes this error .",
    "we have verified that the remaining error is in part related to a lack of isotropy in the lattice velocity set higher than ninth order quadrature .",
    "in this paper , we present a theoretical framework for formulating lattice boltzmann models resulting in the correct thermohydrodynamic equations with an arbitrary prandtl number . unlike the previous approaches , lattice boltzmann models derived under the new framework do not suffer from the well - known non - galilean invariant artifact when prandtl number is not unity .",
    "the critical difference of the present approach from previous ones is that the collision operator complies with a set of fundamental conditions pertaining to thermohydrodynamic fluxes ( eqn.([fcolli ] ) ) in the relative reference frame .",
    "a new explicit form of the collision operator is expressed that is generally applicable for a class of lattice boltzmann velocity types .",
    "the latter are those that sufficiently meet the generic set of moment isotropy conditions , eqn.([iso ] ) .",
    "it is important to point out that the non - galilean invariance problem is not only a symptom of the specific hermite expansion based formulations ( e.g. , eqn.([collh ] ) or eqn.([collh2 ] ) ) . except bgk",
    ", this problem has been prevalent among most lattice boltzmann models having multiple relaxation times in their collision process .",
    "the use of moments in the relative reference frame was previously proposed for formulating certain isothermal `` mrt '' type of lbm models@xcite .",
    "recovery of correct thermohydrodynamics at arbitrary prandtl numbers has not been met in previous lbm models .",
    "a few fronts in thermohydrodynamics may be expanded to beyond the current framework of collision operator representation .",
    "first of all , some potential energy or internal degrees of freedom may be incorporated so that the specific heat values are not restricted to the dimensions of lattices used@xcite .",
    "care must be taken , however , in order to ensure the galilean invariance via a proper hermite expansion remains to be preserved ( see a related discussion in the paragraph below ) .",
    "another extension is pertaining to boundary conditions , to ensure consistency with a thermohydrodynamic system with non - unity prandtl numbers . indeed , a ( soild ) boundary should also bear a prandtl number effect in its thermodynamics ( equilibrium and non - equilibrium ) as well as the boundary momentum and heat fluxes . on the other hand , unlike collisions in a fluid flow domain , the issue of a relative reference frame may not arise if the boundary is stationary ( i.e. , @xmath95 at wall ) , and it may also seem straightforward conceptually ( albeit pontentially algebraically involved ) for a moving boundary with a prescribed velocity . another important point that deserves further investigations in the future :",
    "the current framework only addresses the prandtl number related galilean invariance issue associated with the pre - existing inadequate formulation of collision operators@xcite . with the new collision operator form",
    ", the correct full thermohydrodynamic equations are analytically shown to be recovered as long as a sufficient order isotropy ( quadrature ) ( of ninth order or higher ) is applied ( see appendix ) .",
    "unfortunately , though significantly reduced , the galilean invariance artifact is still conspicuously observed numerically at finite translational velocity values in the resulting thermal diffusivity at non - unity prandtl numbers , via the thermal decay test case in the previous section . though simple",
    ", it needs to be said that that the thermal decay problem is known to be far more non - trivial and delicate than that for a transverse shear fluid velocity@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , such an observed small residual error ( @xmath96 ) in thermal diffusivity in our numerical tests requires more understanding in the future .",
    "one reason we know is that the higher order hermite polynomials and lattice isotropy beyound those for deriving the thermal diffusion term are exhibiting an higher impact at non - unity prandtl numbers .",
    "this has been directly verified by either reducing or increasing quadrature orders in a lattice velocity set used in the test . on the other hand",
    ", one needs to find the theoretical origin of such an increased sensitivity at non - unity prandtl numbers .",
    "borrowing from the notion of gauge transformation , one may notice that the explicit collision operator form eqn.([collh2r ] ) presented in the preceding section is not unique for satisfying the set of conditions eqns.([consvr])-([fcolli ] ) .",
    "for instance , more terms of higher order hermite tensors may be added , similar to terms in eqn.([collh ] ) but not in eqn.([collh2 ] ) .",
    "obviously , due to the orthogonality property of hermite tensor polynomials , additional terms corresponding to higher order hermite tensor polynomials will not alter the results for the lower order ones@xcite .",
    "in particular , adding terms with hermite tensor polynomials of order higher than 3 to the collision expression eqn.([collh2r ] ) will not change its property in regard to the conditions eqns.([consvr])-([fcolli ] ) .",
    "furthermore , such a systematic procedure of adding terms of higher order hermite tensor polynomials can also be used to extend the conditions of eqns.([consvr])-([fcolli ] ) beyond the second and the third order moments . the key realization in formulating a collision operator via",
    "the hermite expansion framework is to relax the parity constraints between each hermite basis function and its coefficient , so that the latter includes not only the moment of its own hermite function but also appropriate moments from the lower order hermite functions , as a result of particle velocity in the relative reference frame .",
    "collision operators satisfying an extended set of moment conditions may be relevant for fluid flows in broader regimes including complex and non - newtonian fluid physics .",
    "to demonstrate that the new fundamental conditions eqns.([consvr ] ) - ( [ fcolli ] ) ( or eqn.([eigenr ] ) ) give rise to the correct thermohydrodynamic equations with a variable prandtl number , we give a brief derivation below .",
    "expanding eqn.([eqn1 ] ) in taylor series in powers of spatial and time derivatives and neglecting terms beyond the 2nd order , we have @xmath97 f_i({\\bf x},t ) \\approx \\omega_i({\\bf x},t ) \\label{lpde}\\ ] ] we then apply the standard multiple scale expansion procedure for time and spatial scales as well as for the distribution function@xcite , @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes a small parameter .",
    "the higher order parts of the distribution function ( @xmath100 ) represent deviations from local equilibrium of various degrees , and having vanishing contributions to the conserved quantities , @xmath101 with @xmath14 , @xmath2 , or @xmath15 . separating terms according to powers of @xmath99 , so the following set of hierarchical relations results @xmath102 the first equation in eqn.([hierac ] ) above is trivially satisfied with a matrix operator representation .",
    "we can then take summations of the conserved moments @xmath103 .",
    "in particular , from the second equation in eqn.([hierac ] ) and applying the eigen - value relations , eqn.([eigenr ] ) , we get @xmath104 notice the term proportional to @xmath105 in the second equation above would be missing if the absolute reference frame based collision form , eqn.([collh ] ) , or the eigen - value relations eqn.([eigen ] ) , were used instead .",
    "after recombining terms of all orders , we get the overall set of equations for the conserved moments , @xmath106 = 0 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\partial_t ( \\rho [ \\frac{d}{2 } t + \\frac{1}{2 } { \\bf u}^2 ] ) + \\nabla \\cdot [ { \\bf q}^{(0 ) } + { \\bf q}^{(1 ) } ] = 0 \\label{contin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the momentum and energy fluxes of different orders are dependent solely on the equilibrium distribution function , @xmath107 once again , the term proportional to @xmath108 in the resulting @xmath109 expression above would be missing if an absolute reference frame based formulation were used .",
    "the remaining derivations on @xmath110 and @xmath111 are straightforward , since they no longer rely on properties of a collision operator and only depend on the form of the equilibrium distribution and its spatial and time derivatives ( in the leading order ) . using the 4th order form , eqn.([feq ] ) , for @xmath112 and applying the generic lattice isotropy conditions , eqn.([iso ] ) , up to @xmath113",
