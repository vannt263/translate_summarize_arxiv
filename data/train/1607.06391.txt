    "in this work , we derive simple analytical formulae characterizing the shock evolution in a non - radiative supernova remnant ( snr ) . in order to obtain an analytical solution",
    ", we constrain our discussion to a simple situation : spherical expansion in a smooth medium ( no clouds ) with negligible external thermal pressure .",
    "thermal conduction , magnetic fields and acceleration of cosmic ray particles are also neglected for simplification .",
    "possible extension of the current model to more complicated situations will be studied in future work .",
    "the work presented here focuses on the evolution of a remnant in the post supernova phase .",
    "a point explosion with an ejecta mass of @xmath0 and total energy of @xmath1 is assumed as our initial condition .",
    "the energetic explosion then drives a blast wave into the surrounding ambient medium . at early times , when the ejecta mass @xmath2 the swept up medium mass , the evolution of the remnant can follow two different evolutionary tracks depending on the spatial density distribution of the ejecta envelope . if the ejecta envelope has a shallow density profile @xmath3 with power law index @xmath4 , the early evolution of a snr is simply characterized by the free expansion ( fe ) of the ejecta . on the other hand ,",
    "if the ejecta envelope has a steep density profile @xmath3 with power law index @xmath5 , the early evolution of a snr is instead described by the so called self similar driven wave ( ssdw ) solution @xcite . as the blast wave expands",
    ", @xmath6 gradually increases with time and eventually becomes dynamically important . when @xmath7 , the expanding snr has already lost the memory of ejecta mass @xmath0 and starts to follow the self similar sedov - taylor ( st ) solution @xcite .",
    "conventionally , the evolution of a non - radiative snr is divided into two phases , the ejecta dominated ( ed ) phase when @xmath8 and st phase when @xmath9 .",
    "the term `` st phase '' however is misleading , as in the st phase the evolution of a snr does not necessarily follow the st solution @xcite . it is more accurate to consider the st phase as an ambient medium dominated phase .    analytic approximations for the shock evolution in a non - radiative snr have been discussed extensively in @xcite ( hereafter tm99 ) for a uniform ambient medium .",
    "later , , @xcite , and @xcite extended the solution in tm99 to the wind density profile medium for an ejecta envelope with a steep density profile ( power law index @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , their solutions are not compared with numerical simulations .",
    "all these analytical solutions are based on the method of tm99 . from here on , we refer to the tm model as the combination of the above solutions . in the tm model ,",
    "the blast wave solution contains two parts , _ a general ed solution _ for the ed phase and _ a general st solution _ for the st phase .",
    "the transition time @xmath11 defined in tm99 , which separates the _ general ed solution _ from the _ general st solution _ , is slightly different from the time when @xmath12 and in many cases is obtained through fitting with numerical simulations .",
    "the _ general ed solution _ is obtained by assuming the pressure behind the blast wave is proportional to that behind the reverse shock .",
    "it has two different forms depending on whether the reverse shock is in the envelope or the core of ejecta .",
    "general st solution _ is an offset power law that smoothly connects the _ general ed solution _ with the st solution .",
    "the solution for the reverse shock in the tm model also contains two parts . in the ed phase ,",
    "the reverse shock position is derived by assuming the reverse shock radius is proportional to blast wave radius . in the st phase ,",
    "the reverse shock is described by a solution with constant acceleration in the unshocked ejecta frame .    here",
    "we present a new analytical method to derive approximate solutions describing the shock evolution in a snr from the ed phase to the st phase .",
    "the method is based on dimensional analysis and depends on only the asymptotic behaviors of the remnant , i.e. the fe solution and the ssdw solution for @xmath13 and the st solution for @xmath14 . since no assumption about the dynamical structure of the remnant is required as in the tm model , the analytical approximations discussed here are much simpler than the tm model solutions .",
    "the method presented here could potentially be extended to other problems involving the transition between two adjacent asymptotic limits .    in section 2",
    ", we develop the analytical approach used to derive the approximate solutions",
    ". then we use the new method to study the forward shock evolution in a non - radiative snr .",
    "analytical approximations for both ejecta envelope with a shallow density profile @xmath4 and a steep density profile @xmath5 are discussed in detail . in section 3 ,",
    "we summarize the analytical approximations for the forward shock and then compare them with numerical simulations and the tm model .",
    "we focus on two particular interesting cases : snr evolution in the interstellar medium with a constant density profile and snr evolution in circumstellar material with a wind density profile .",
    "a reader who is only interested in the final expressions of the analytical approximations can go directly to this section . in section 4",
