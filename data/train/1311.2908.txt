    "the _ ab initio _ calculation of hadron mass spectra and other hadron observables remains an outstanding theoretical question .",
    "recent observations of `` tetraquark '' states in the quarkonium spectrum point to the pressing need for theoretical methods which can address such systems . in the current `` supercomputing era , '' the computational tools necessary for such large - scale calculations are now readily available",
    ".    the recently developed basis light - front quantization ( blfq ) @xcite approach is a promising tool for tackling hadron problems .",
    "blfq combines the well - known advantages of light - front dynamics @xcite with modern developments in _ ab initio _ nuclear structure calculations , such as the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the light - front hamiltonian formulation to non - relativistic quantum mechanics allows the quantum field theoretical bound state problem to be formulated as large , sparse matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "state - of - the - art methods developed for ncsm calculations can then brought to bear on the hadron problem .",
    "blfq has so far been applied to the problem of a free electron in qed .",
    "honkanen @xcite and zhao @xcite calculated schwinger s electron anomalous magnetic moment to high precision within the blfq approach .",
    "more recently , blfq has been applied to time - dependent problems in non - perturbative quantum field theory , such as non - linear compton scattering @xcite .    here , we present the first application of blfq to a bound state problem , using the positronium system as a test case .",
    "we develop a two - body effective interaction that acts only on the two - particle sector of the basis .",
    "our calculation is thus equivalent to a ladder truncation on the light front .",
    "in blfq , hadron observables are calculated by solving the equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy - momentum 4-vector operator .",
    "using light - cone gauge , the operator @xmath2 can be constructed .",
    "this operator plays the role of the hamiltonian in ncsm calculations , and is often referred to as the `` light - cone hamiltonian '' @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "one can then calculate the matrix elements of this operator in a basis to produce a matrix , which can be diagonalized to find the mass eigenvalues ( squared ) and light - front amplitudes .",
    "the approach is thus non - perturbative .",
    "since the basis is infinite dimensional , it must be truncated for the problem to be tractable on a computer .",
    "three separate truncations are made in blfq .",
    "the first is truncation on the number of fock sectors .",
    "since we are solving a quantum field theory , the basis must , in principle , contain `` sectors '' with all possible numbers and species of particles that can be generated by the interactions within @xmath2 . the operator @xmath2 contains terms which change particle number and thus couples the sectors .",
    "for example , the `` physical '' positronium state , could be expressed schematically as @xmath4 in order to have a finite basis , then , we must truncate the fock sectors at some point .",
    "this truncation will be made by physical considerations . for the moment",
    "we restrict ourselves to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 sectors .",
    "this should be sufficient for generating the bohr spectrum of positronium .",
    "we do not yet make any attempt to examine the limit of increasing the number of fock sectors .",
    "secondly , we need a truncation on the light - front longitudinal modes .",
    "we discretize the longitudinal momentum by putting our system in a longitudinal box of length @xmath7 and applying periodic boundary conditions ( bcs ) .",
    "specifically , we choose periodic bcs for bosons and anti - periodic bcs for fermions .",
    "thus @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an integer for bosons , or a half - integer for fermions . for bosons ,",
    "we exclude the `` zero modes '' , i.e. @xmath10 . in the many - body basis",
    ", we select the value of the total longitudinal momentum @xmath11 , where the sum is over particles .",
    "we then parameterize this using a dimensionless variable @xmath12 such that @xmath13 . for a given particle @xmath14 ,",
    "the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16    due to the positivity of longitudinal momenta on the light front @xcite , fixing @xmath17 serves as a fock space cutoff and makes the number of longitudinal modes finite @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath17 determines our `` resolution '' in the longitudinal direction , and thus our resolution on parton distribution functions .",
    "real physics corresponds to the limit @xmath18 .",
    "finally , in the light - front transverse direction we employ a 2d harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis .",
    "that is , the basis functions are the eigenfunctions of the potential @xmath19 .",
    "each value of the _ oscillator energy parameter _",
    "@xmath20 determines a unique complete basis .",
    "convergence rates depend upon @xmath21 but the final converged results should not . the basis is made finite by restricting the number of allowed oscillator quanta according to @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the radial and orbital quantum numbers of the 2d harmonic oscillator , respectively . of course",
    ", real physics is obtained in the continuum limit of @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , we use an m - scheme basis . that is , our many - body basis states have a well - defined value of @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the helicity .",
    "these basis states do not , however , have a well - defined value of total @xmath28 .",
    "since our basis is constructed in single - particle coordinates , the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion of the system is contained in our solutions .",
    "this problem is also faced in ncsm calculations .",
    "the use of the ho basis combined with the @xmath29 truncation is a great advantage here since it allows for the exact factorization of the wavefunction into `` intrinsic '' and `` cm '' components , even within a truncated basis .",
    "the cm motion can then be removed from the low - lying spectrum by introducing a lagrange multiplier proportional to @xmath30 ( also known as the lawson term ) to the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the extra term essentially makes cm excitations very costly energetically and thus forces the cm part of the wavefunction to be the ground state of cm motion . in this way ,",
    "spurious cm excitations are removed from the spectrum of interest .",
    "it is important to note that , in ncsm calculations , the exact factorization only happens if the isoscalar kinetic energy is used .",
    "that is , the proton and neutron mass are treated as the same . on the light front",
    ", the kinetic energy can be written as @xmath31 comparing to the non - relativistic form @xmath32 we see that , on the light front , the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath15 is analogous to mass .",
    "thus the equivalent to using the isoscalar kinetic energy in the ncsm is for the particles to have _ equal longitudinal momentum splitting_. for two fermions , this situation corresponds to @xmath33 ( similarly @xmath34 for three fermions ) .",
    "indeed , in initial applications of blfq it was found that cm factorization only occured when the total longitudinal momentum was split equally among the constituents . in order to generalize the factorization ,",
    "the following alternate coordinates were introduced @xcite :",
    "@xmath35 when the hamiltonian is expressed in these coordinates , exact cm factorization is obtained for all eigenstates even in a basis with arbitrary distributions of longitudinal momenta as well as an arbitrary numbers of sectors .",
    "an illustration of the exact cm factorization in blfq is given in refs .",
    "we truncate the fock space to include only @xmath5 , and @xmath6 states . we wish to formulate an effective potential acting only in the @xmath5 space that includes the effects generated by the @xmath6 space . in the formalism of effective potentials , we consider the @xmath36 space to be the @xmath5 space and @xmath37 space to be the @xmath6 space .",
    "let @xmath38 be the operator that projects onto the @xmath36 space , and @xmath39 be the operator that projects onto the @xmath37 space .",
    "we choose the bloch form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the bloch form of the effective hamiltonian has several advantages compared to the traditional tamm - dancoff effective hamiltonian used in previous studies of positronium on the light front @xcite .",
    "the bloch effective hamiltonian has only unperturbed energies in the energy denominators , as opposed to an energy eigenvalue which then needs to be found in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian is also automatically hermitian .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian is given by :    @xmath40 .",
    "\\label{eq : heff}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath41 is the light - cone hamiltonian introduced above .",
    "states @xmath14 and @xmath42 are states in @xmath36 space ( @xmath5 ) , while state @xmath23 is in the @xmath37 space ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xmath43 is the unperturbed energy of state @xmath14 , etc .",
    "note that if @xmath44 this reduces to the usual formula from second - order energy shift in perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , note that , due to the definition of @xmath45 , both the `` hamiltonian '' and the `` energy '' have mass - squared dimensions .",
    "the mass eigenvalues are thus the square root of the eigenvalues of @xmath45 .",
    "the derivation of , based on a perturbative expansion of the okubo - lee - suzuki effective hamiltonian @xcite , is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "@xmath46 is the part of the hamiltonian that acts within the two - particle space .",
    "it contains two pieces .",
    "first , it contains the two - particle kinetic energy .",
    "secondly , it contains the light - front instantaneous photon exchange interaction .",
    "thus it can be expressed as @xmath47 the instantaneous photon exchange interaction @xmath48 contains a singularity of the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the incoming ( outgoing ) fermion .",
    "this singularity is not physical and must be cancelled .",
    "since we are interested in primarily the effects of repeated photon exchange , we will only include those combinations of terms in @xmath52 and @xmath53 which generate the photon exchange .",
    "we neglect the combinations which result in the photon being emitted and absorbed by the same fermion .",
    "that is , we do not incorporate the fermion self - energy , and therefore no fermion mass renormalization is necessary in this model .",
    "in addition , we work with unit - normalized eigenstates and a fixed value of the coupling constant .    in light - front _",
    "s_-matrix perturbation theory @xmath44 . in momentum space ,",
    "the sum in reduces to a sum over the polarization states of the photon : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a unit null vector .",
    "the second term in generates a term identical to the instantaneous photon exchange term of the light - front hamiltonian , but opposite in sign .",
    "that is , a piece of the second term on the rhs of cancels the instantaneous exchange piece ( @xmath48 in ) of the first term on the rhs of , leaving the effective interaction free of light - front small-@xmath15 divergences @xcite .    in our non - perturbative calculation @xmath56 and the cancellation of small-@xmath15 singularities",
    "does not occur in general .",
    "this leaves the effective potential with an unphysical singularity , and the resulting interaction is unstable with increasing @xmath17",
    ". the numerical calculation , as a result , does not converge to a finite number in the continuum limit .    to cure this pathology , we introduce a counterterm of the form @xmath57 , \\label{eq : ct}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the resulting effective potential is @xmath60}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this form the cancellation of the instantaneous diagram does occur , and @xmath61 is free of unphysical light - front small-@xmath15 singularities .",
    "we note that our choice of counterterm is equivalent to the prescription used in previous work in light - front effective potentials @xcite .    by substituting in the terms from the lfqed hamiltonian , along with the free - field momentum - space mode expansions",
    ", the effective potential can be easily derived , and the cancellation of the instantaneous diagram verified . the sum over intermediate states",
    "is performed in momentum space , before translating the result back to the ho basis .",
    "the result , after cancelling the instantaneous interaction , is @xmath62 } \\nonumber\\\\&&\\times \\left(2\\pi\\right)^2\\delta^{(2)}\\left(\\sqrt{x_1}q_1+\\sqrt{x_2}q_2-\\sqrt{x_1'}q_1'-\\sqrt{x_2'}q_2'\\right ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the 4-component dirac spinors and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is a fictitious photon mass ; see below . ) the integral is evaluated using repeated 2d talmi - moshinsky ( tm ) transformations @xcite . with the help of these tm transformations , the integral",
    "can be reduced down to a single 2d integral , which is evaluated numerically .",
    "the details of the calculation will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the effective potential @xmath61 has one remaining singularity we have not yet discussed . in the event that @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the integrations diverge in the low transverse - momentum limit .",
    "the singularity thus corresponds to the case where the photon has zero momentum .",
    "the exact same singularity was found within the context of a bloch hamiltonian on the light front in ref .",
    "the integral has no singularity if @xmath69 .",
    "this is why we have introduced @xmath66 as a regulator for this physical infrared divergence .",
    "thus , in addition to examining the limits @xmath18 and @xmath25 , we must also consider the limit @xmath70 .",
    "in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the hyperfine splitting between the @xmath71 and @xmath72 states of positronium scales as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the fine structure constant . at physical coupling , the expected hyperfine splitting and even the binding energy are then uncomfortably small relative to the precision of our numerical integrals .",
    "since we would like to use the hyperfine splitting to test our blfq results , we use a large coupling of @xmath75 to exaggerate both the binding energy and the hyperfine splitting .",
    "we then compare our results not to experiment , but to the predictions of non - relativistic quantum mechanics at this unphysical value of @xmath74 .",
    "this value of @xmath74 also allows a direct comparison to the discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the numerical results were obtained using the hopper cray xe6 at nersc .",
    "scalapack software @xcite was used for the diagonalization . in this particular implementation of blfq ,",

    "those authors also find an overall overbinding , and a hyperfine splitting of the correct order of magnitude .",
    "they do not report a numerical result for the @xmath92 state .",
    "we have calculated the spectrum of the positronium system in the non - perturbative basis light - front quantization approach . instead of tackling the problem directly with a dynamical photon",
    ", we have introduced a two - body effective interaction , which implements the effects of photon exchange , but not the fermion self - energy .",
    "thus no mass renormalization was necessary in this calculation .",
    "the final converged results agree qualitatively with the expectations of nrqm and previous work in dlcq , with a tendency toward overbinding .",
    "we note that previous authors @xcite who have worked on ladder truncation of positronium on the light front have seen a slight dependence on the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory .",
    "these authors claim that the divergence they see will be cancelled when crossed ladder graphs are included in the interaction kernel .",
    "while currently we see no evidence of such a divergence , we accept that it is present and believe that we are simply not yet at high enough @xmath29 to be sensitive to it .",
    "these issues will be explored in future work .",
    "our two - body effective potential model should also be applicable to heavy quarkonia if we include a confining potential , such as the one motivated by `` soft wall '' ads / qcd @xcite . the effective interaction implemented here",
    "could then be interpreted as providing a first correction to the basic ads / qcd spectrum .",
    "implementation of the problem with one or more dynamical photons in the basis requires the implementation of a non - perturbative renormalization scheme , such as the fock sector dependent scheme of karmanov _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cancellation of unphysical light - front singularities would need to occur numerically within the matrix diagonalization , and not analytically as is done here .",
