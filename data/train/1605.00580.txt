    "hamaker constants  @xcite , @xmath0 , dominate the wettability  @xcite of solvents , which is one of the critical properties in industrial applications of sol - gel methods  @xcite , including solution processes for semiconductor devices .",
    "@xcite microscopic insights on the wettability  @xcite relates the hamaker constant with molecular interactions , which can be , in principle , evaluated from _ ab initio _ simulations . from the asymptotic behavior of molecular binding curves , or potential energy surfaces ( pes ) , @xmath4 , the hamaker constant can be computed as @xmath5 , provided that only a binding with a single @xmath6 matters and a naive superposition is expected .",
    "@xcite the index , add , then stands for additive and @xmath7 denotes the molecular density which appears when the superposition integral is counted . though we can find several such prototypical works  @xcite of the _ab initio _ assessment applied to simple and highly symmetric molecules , we would immediately encounter troubles when attempting to apply the framework to practical solute molecules .",
    "most molecules of industrial interest are not so highly symmetric that we can not generally expect the additivity of the interaction .",
    "@xcite in these cases , too many alignments of coalescence are possible due to the anisotropy of molecules , bewildering us how to model the coalescence with the confidence for capturing the nature of the system .    the main subject of the present paper is how to estimate @xmath0 for the practical solute molecules via @xmath8 with plausible considerations mainly for the anisotropy .",
    "once we could establish such a scheme , such database of molecular interactions aided by recent _ ab initio _",
    "methods  @xcite can provide the hamaker constants over various liquids .",
    "it would help to predict , control , and design such solution processes including not only wettablities but also suspensions and solvabilities by using empirical molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "@xcite    the present study has been originally motivated by the demand to estimate @xmath0 for a cyclohexasilane molecule , si@xmath1h@xmath2 ( chs ) , which is used as an ink for printed electronics technology to fabricate polycrystalline si film transistors .",
    "@xcite the ink including si - based precursors is sprayed on a substrate , which is sintered to form an amorphous si thin film , without using expensive vacuum equipment in the conventional semiconductor processes .",
    "the ink printing process has hence attracted recent interests for realizing more saving and lower environmental impact technology .",
    "@xcite controlling the wettability of these inks is of rather general interest because the technology is about to be applied further to fabricate oxide or carbon nanotube film semiconductor devices  @xcite by using various inks instead of si - based ones . for going beyond conventional / experimental preparations of inks ,",
    "several simulations have been made to analyze the wettability of droplets on ink - jet processes dynamically using molecular dynamics  @xcite or empirical models  @xcite .",
    "the predictability of these simulations strongly depends on the force fields that are currently prepared by empirical parameterizations of lennard - jones type potentials .",
    "the _ ab initio _",
    "assessment for these parameterizations is obviously recognized as an important breakthrough in getting more universal applicability .    for chs",
    ", there is no reference to @xmath0 , and then we tried evaluating @xmath8 from its binding curve . besides the anisotropy discussed above , the commonly available framework , dft ( density functional theory ) , is known to fail to describe molecular interactions mostly , and the dft performance strongly depends on exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals adopted .",
    "@xcite in the present case , the interaction of this system , chs , is of non-@xmath9 staking nature , known as an _",
    "aliphatic - aliphatic _ one  @xcite between the @xmath10 bonds at the homo ( highest - occupied molecular orbital ) levels of the monomers . unlike _ aromatic - aromatic _ interactions of _",
    "e.g. _ benzene dimer , there has been only a few investigations on _ aliphatic - aliphatic _ interactions and hence no established scheme of how to treat the anisotropy of molecules in the evaluation of binding curves even for moderately tractable size and symmetry of the target molecules . as is well - known , accurate correlated methods such as ccsd(t ) are required to get enough reliable estimations of molecular interaction .",
    "@xcite such methods are , in general , quite costly in the sense of the scalability on the system size @xmath11 , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath12 for ccsd(t )  @xcite .",
    "such severe scalabilities obstruct the applications to larger molecules being likely in the practical cases .",
    "in contrast , dmc ( diffusion monte carlo ) method is quite promising and its applicability to more practical issues gets rapidly extended .",
    "@xcite this framework is regarded in principle as the most reliable that can achieve numerically exact solutions in some cases  @xcite , and there has been so far several applications to noncovalent systems  @xcite , to calibrate even over accurate molecular orbital methods such as ccsd(t ) .",
    "dmc scales at worst to @xmath13 ,  @xcite making it possible to be applied further to larger molecules including molecular crystals .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we therefore applied dmc to evaluate @xmath8 of chs . upon a careful benchmark on benzene molecule ( given in appendix c )",
    ", we have established a scheme ( i ) coping with the anisotropy of the molecules , ( ii ) reducing statistical errorbars and biases that are small enough for a usable predictions , and ( iii ) based on several possible validations on the predicted @xmath0 for which no experimental reference value is available .",
    "the scheme is applied to chs getting @xmath14 [ zj ] which is in a reasonable range validated by several side considerations . by making comparisons with binding curves by dft",
    ", we also provide a useful calibration over several xc for the predictability of @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is then organized as follows : in the main body of the paper , we provide descriptions of the scheme applied to chs , followed by validations of the prediction as briefly as possible so as to concentrate on following the established procedure .",
    "thus , put aside into appendices are detailed descriptions for computational methods ( appendix a ) , some formalism of hamaker constants considered in the present work ( appendix b ) , and all the discussions on the validations of the procedure made on the benzene dimer benchmark ( appendix c - e ) .",
    "technical details about evaluation of @xmath8 for chs are also given alongside the benzene case in the appendices .",
    "summaries of the paper are given as concluding remarks at the end of main text .",
    "for detailed correction schemes , such as bsse ( basis set superposition error ) , cbs ( complete basis set ) schemes as well as time - step error in dmc are given in supporting information .",
    "[ dimer - pattern ] . computational details for the evaluation are given in appendix a. for the chs monomer structure , we took the chair conformation  @xcite since it is known to be most stable .",
    "the monomer geometry is optimized at the b3lyp/6 - 311 g level using gaussian09 .",
    "@xcite to plot a binding curve , we vary binding distances of a dimer coalescence , keeping each of the monomer structures fixed to the above one .",
    "this is valid to some extent because we focus on @xmath6 extracted from the long - range behavior where each of the monomer structures may be almost the same as that of an isolated monomer .",
    "the inter - monomer distance is defined as that between the centers of gravity of the monomers .",
    "[ ljfitting ] shows dmc binding curves for each coalescence configurations , compared with ccsd(t ) references .",
    "the sandwich ( type a ) configuration is identified to give the most stable binding energy @xmath15 over the others , @xmath16 98 % at @xmath17k as given in table  [ table : two - body ] .",
    "our careful benchmark for benzene case given in appendix c clarifies that the deepest binding configuration almost dominates hamaker constants .",
    "we can therefore concentrate only on the type a binding curve to extract @xmath6 from its asymptotic behavior .",
    "hereafter we adopt a symbol , @xmath18 , as a @xmath6 value for the most stable coalescence configuration .",
