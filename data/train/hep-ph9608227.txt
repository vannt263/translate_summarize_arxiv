    "the using of artificial neural network ( ann ) for solving a very different physical problems become very extensive and promising in the last years ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stage of complexity of physical processes together with the huge number of data to be proceed makes the  classical type  calculation so complicated that the results sometimes can be reached on the very edge of reality .",
    "one of the best examples of such situation is the extensive air shower ( eas ) physics .",
    "it is possible , in principle , to describe the eas using the monte  carlo technics .",
    "main processes concerning particle traverse through the air are known to some extend .",
    "some believe that the contemporary knowledge of high energy hadronic collisions is good enough to lead us to solutions of some important cosmic ray physics problems .",
    "even if it is so , the problem is how to evaluate the physical answer from the cosmic ray experiment data .",
    "the only one way possible at present is to compare the results of monte  carlo calculations with the measurements .",
    "the most common result of such comparison is the complain that the data obtained from the measurement are not in a very close agreement with the assumed model monte  carlo predictions .",
    "( some  physical  discussions are about the question :  how far they disagree ?  .",
    "but this is not a physical question ! )",
    "the main goal is in the complexity of the problem .",
    "( the monte ",
    "carlo programs used are about hundreds of thousands line long .",
    "the first question is how much we can trust them .",
    "this is also not a  physical  question , but we should bear it in minds . ) the best , most popular i should say , monte  carlo codes to simulate a high energy hadronic interactions have to contain two main sources of uncertainty .",
    "first , due to the absence of the theory of strong interactions to build models some more or less strong physical assumptions about the interaction pictures are needed .",
    "some simplifications during the modeling is a natural way to do so and it can also be treated as a source of uncertainty (  unremovable  ) .",
    "the another one is the values of the model parameters which can not be taken from the theory and have to be fitted to some ( mainly accelerator ) experiment results .",
    "the contemporary monte ",
    "carlo programs needs about hundred parameter ( some of them very well known , some unknown at all ) .",
    "the question arises : how the cosmic ray physics can be driven from such a unpure  theoretical  predictions ?",
    "let us look at that problem from the other side .",
    "the very best existing ( and those which will be build in near future ) experimental apparatus consist of large number of different detectors distributed over a wide ( effective ) area .",
    "the data collected give a possibility to study different characteristics of the eas .",
    "each of them is * somehow * connected to the different ",
    "part  of the shower development .",
    "the bold letters were used to stress the connection which exists for sure , and which is unknown for the reasons given above .",
    "the question of the major importance in cosmic ray physics is about the nature of primary cosmic rays : energetic and mass spectrum .",
    "the detail knowledge of the connections between cosmic ray flux on the top of the atmosphere and the detector response in the array on the ground level is certainly appreciated , but the lack of it do not make a further study hopeless .",
    "some general features observed in eas on ground level related to the mass of primary cr particle are more or less _",
    "model independent_. calculations shows that many of the shower parameters depends on the mass but all those dependencies are smeared due to individual shower development fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "these fluctuations are also related to the nature of the primary particle . to get the maximum information on the shower registered by a complex and extended array there are at least two general ways .",
    "first is to get a set of parameters describing the shower in the most complete way .",
    "this can be understood as a contraction of the rough experimental multidimensional space ( in which each of the dimension is given by a single detector signal ) to the much less dimensional space of some shower parameters .",
    "this reduction can be more or less fortunate and there is no arbitrary way to do this .",
    "the further analysis of that contracted space can be done in a conventional way by comparing the experimental points with the monte  carlo simulated showers ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of experiment dedicated to primary mass determination",
    "the most required contraction is to reduce all measurement space to one  dimensional which will be interpreted as a primary mass response of the apparatus .",
    "sometimes ones require that the reduction procedure should be also the most effective one .",
    "this means that it should minimize the interpretation errors . to find such best data evaluation procedure",
    "a different methods can be used .",
    "the well defined one is the principal component analysis procedure discussed e.g. in ref .",
    "the disadvantage of all that procedures is in the fact that all of them rely very strong on the monte ",
    "carlo simulation programs .",
    "the proof of the exactness of the methods is very hard and is always connected with the believe of the accuracy of the shower development description .",
    "the second way is the object of that paper .",
    "the rough experimental data space can be reduced promptly using the artificial neural networks .",
    "the ann can be trained on a monte  carlo simulated array responses with the known initial cosmic ray particle .",
    "the reduction of the dimensionality of the output we wish to have is done by definition using the general rules established in monte ",
    "carlo sample .",
    "the question of the correctness of the ann procedure is more complicated mainly because the theory of such a method is poorly known .",
    "the nature of the process of network self  organizing is a enigma , and the rules developed by the network during training are far from the standard  physical  ones . for the very complicated networks the are even hard to extract .",
    "the proof of correctness is much harder than for a known statistical methods , even if possible in general .",
    "but , as someone says ,  the proof of the pudding is in the eating ",
    "i want to show that the method can be satisfactory used in some cases .    in the present work",
    "i want to show some preliminary results concerning the ann analysis using as an example the muon part of the array of the kascade experiment in karlsruhe ( ref .",
    "the muon array consists of 192 detectors of 3.2 @xmath0 each spread over 200 @xmath1 200 m surface .",
    "the energy threshold of muon is 0.1 gev .",
    "i want study to what extend the information from these counters can be analyzed with the help of ann technics .",
    "the minimizing procedures usually used for estimation of some distribution parameters need two conditions to be fulfilled .",
    "one is to have a measurement of the shower statistically accurate enough to be used .",
    "the problem can be seen very well in fig .",
    "[ easmi ] where the typical muon detector responses for the shower in the array of the kascade geometry is presented .    in the most of showers the numbers registered by the muon detectors oscillated around the very few .",
    "the large statistical density fluctuations are expected .",
    "another condition is that the assumption about the real distribution one trying to fit is a correct one . in literature",
    "there are usually a few possibilities and which one to chose is a question of taste .",
    "the differences is expected not to be large , but a word ",
    "large  has not a precise meaning .",
    "the ann method is , by definition , not bothered by both such problems . to show that , i want to present the results concerning the total muon number determination for individual showers by the kascade  like experiments .",
    "it should be pointed out here also that the traditional minimization methods of the muon lateral distribution determination need additional information about the extensive air shower usually obtained from the measurement of the electromagnetic component part of the experiment .",
    "they are the shower core position and the shower axis inclination angles .",
    "for the results presented in that section those shower parameters are not used .",
