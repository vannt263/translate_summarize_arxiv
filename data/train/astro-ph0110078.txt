    "research on galaxy interactions has so far mainly focussed on normal galaxies .",
    "however , given the large number ratio of dwarf - to - normal galaxies in the local universe , close encounters among gas - rich dwarf galaxies may not be rare and have a considerable impact on the star formation history and dynamical state of these systems . whether interaction / merging with a faint stellar or gaseous companion is the genuine process driving starburst activity in blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies ( cf .",

    "however , the hypothesis that interactions can efficiently trigger star formation activity in gas - rich dwarfs received observational support by a number of recent studies ( e.g. ii zw 33 , walter et al .",

    "optical broad band and h@xmath5 data of ii zw 70/71 were obtained during several observing runs with the 2.2 m calar alto telescope equipped with cafos and the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) with alfosc . near  infrared exposures were taken with omega prime at the calar alto 3.5 m telescope , and with the recently commissioned ingrid camera at the ing 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) .",

    "optical and nir data were calibrated through observations of standards and using field stars from the 2mass catalogue .",
    "surface brightness profiles ( fig .",

    "the surface brightness profiles of both bcds can be approximated by an exponential fitting law at radii where the luminosity contribution of the starburst becomes small ( ii zw 70 : 16@xmath1024 , ii zw 71 : 26@xmath1035 ) . for the lsb hosts of",
    "ii zw 70 and ii zw 71 we derive , respectively , a @xmath7 band central surface brightness of 22.2@xmath110.15 mag/@xmath6  and 21.2@xmath110.1 mag/@xmath6  and an exponential scale length of 580 pc and 675 pc . such structural properties are in the range of those inferred previously for lsb hosts of ie / ne bcds ( cf .",

    "roughly 20% of the emission registered below 26.2 @xmath7 mag/@xmath6   or @xmath33% of the total @xmath7 band light of ii zw 70 is accounted for by the extension se .",
    "this faint feature which can be traced on the available deep optical exposures out to 165 ( @xmath39 kpc ) from the optical maximum of ii zw 70 deserves a closer inspection .",
    "the average colors of the unresolved continuum therein are substantially bluer ( @xmath17 + 0.4 mag , @xmath18 mag ) than those determined for the main body of the lsb host .",
    "such colors lend support to the hypothesis that the se extension is composed of stars having recently formed within the h streamer connecting the bcds rather than stars pulled - out from the lsb host of ii zw 70 during the interaction .",
    "the non - detection of h@xmath5 emission at the location of feature se ( cairs et al . 2001 ) in connection with its blue broad band colors are consistent with an age of @xmath19 yr if an instantaneous formation process is assumed .",
    "the results obtained here support the view that a substantial piece of information on the dynamical response and secular evolution of the stellar lsb component in interacting dwarf galaxies is potentially present in their very faint outskirts . a continued investigation of the formation process and nature of the extension se / nw in ii zw 70/71 as well as the search for similar interaction - induced features in other pairs of dwarf galaxies is apparently of great interest ."
