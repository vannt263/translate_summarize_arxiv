    "one of the many interesting features of bose - einstein condensed atoms is that they can support solitary waves , in particular when these are confined in elongated traps . under typical conditions , these gases are very dilute and are described by the familiar gross - pitaevskii equation , a nonlinear schrdinger equation with an additional term to describe the external trapping potential .",
    "it is well known that the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( with no external potential ) supports solitonic solutions through the interplay between the nonlinear term and dispersion . in the presence of an external trapping potential ,",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation becomes non - integrable .",
    "in elongated quasi - one - dimensional traps , it is reasonable to approximate the three - dimensional solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation by separating longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the resulting effective one - dimensional nonlinear equation has a nonlinear term that is not necessarily quadratic @xcite .",
    "still , such nonlinear equations support solitary - wave solutions , which must be found numerically .",
    "solitary waves have been created and observed in trapped gases of atoms @xcite . in the initial experiments @xcite the effective interaction between the atoms was repulsive . in this case , the solitary waves are localized depressions in the density , which are known as  grey \" solitary waves .",
    "these waves move with a velocity less than the speed of sound .",
    "when the minimum of the density ( at the center of the wave ) becomes zero , they do not move at all and thus become  dark \" .    more recently , the two experiments of refs.@xcite considered the case of an effective attraction between the atoms and observed  bright \" solitary waves , i.e. , blob(s ) of atoms which preserve their shape and distinct identity .",
    "@xcite created an initial state of many separate solitary waves .",
    "while these independent waves were seen to oscillate in the weak harmonic potential in the longitudinal direction , they did not merge to form one solitary wave .",
    "in other words , they behaved as if the effective interaction between two of these waves were repulsive .",
    "numerous theoretical studies have been motivated by the experiments of refs.@xcite , see e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "reference @xcite offered an explanation for the observed effective repulsion between solitary waves .",
    "as argued there , the experiments had been performed in a manner that gave rise to a phase difference of @xmath0 between adjacent solitary waves . according to an older study @xcite , solitary waves with a phase difference equal to @xmath0",
    "indeed repel each other .    in the present study we use a toroidal trap @xcite as a model for examining the time evolution of a system that initially has two solitary waves using numerical solutions to the corresponding time - dependent one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "remarkably , such toroidal traps have been designed @xcite , and very recently persistent currents have been created and observed in such traps @xcite .",
    "the basic conclusion of our study is that the effective repulsion between solitary waves is due to conservation laws and thus fragile .    in what follows ,",
    "we first present our model in sec ii . in sec.iii",
    "we examine the dynamics of the gas in the case of weak dissipation , starting with perfectly symmetric / antisymmetric initial conditions and with no external potential along the torus .",
    "we observe that the symmetric configuration of two blobs merges on a short time scale ; the blobs in the initially antisymmetric configuration remain distinct and separated . using these results as  reference \" plots , we examine in sec.iv the effect of a weak random potential on perfectly symmetric / antisymmetric initial conditions .",
    "we also examine in sec.v the time evolution of states that deviate slightly from perfect symmetry / antisymmetry in the absence of any random potential . in both cases ,",
    "the symmetric ( or nearly symmetric ) initial configuration shows essentially the same behavior as the reference symmetric system . on the other hand , the antisymmetric configuration with the addition of an extra weak random potential and the nearly antisymmetric configuration with no external potential both lead to a merger of the two blobs after a moderate transient time . in the antisymmetric case , the final state is strongly influenced by weak deviations from the  ideal \" case .",

    "the antisymmetric case shown in figs.[fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] is of greater interest . here ,",

    ", there are two localized blobs",
    ". however , parity is no longer a conserved quantity in this case .",
    "there is no symmetry in the system to preserve the node that was built into the initial conditions . as a result",
    ", the two blobs eventually merge into one in contrast to the results of fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "in other words , the apparent repulsion of the two solitary waves is not present at sufficiently large @xmath54 .",
    "in another set of runs , we set the random potential to zero and select slightly asymmetric initial configuration , with @xmath55 . our initial condition is thus not a parity eigenstate and our calculations show that again the two initially distinct blobs merge after a characteristic timescale .",
    "the qualitative features of this calculation are the same as in the case of a random potential described in the previous section .    in the case of an almost symmetric initial configuration ,",
    "@xmath34 shown in fig.[fig6 ] , the two separate blobs merge rapidly , very much as in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] . on the other hand , the almost antisymmetric case ,",
    "@xmath39 shown in figs.[fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] , shows a plateau in the energy and a period of  quasi - equilibrium \" during which the two blobs have relatively well - determined shape and location .",
    "eventually , however , the two blobs merge again into a single solitary wave , much as in fig.[fig10 ] but unlike fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "according to the results of our study , the observed repulsion between bright solitary waves in the experiment of ref.@xcite implies that the conservation laws were not substantially violated during the time interval investigated .",
    "more precisely , it suggests that deviations from axial symmetry in the trapping potential must have been small , the initial configuration was very close to a ( negative ) parity eigenstate , and that dissipation must have been weak .",
    "it is instructive to estimate the timescale , @xmath56 , for our study . if one considers a value of @xmath9 equal to the longitudinal size of an elongated trap , @xmath57 mm , then @xmath58 sec , which is a rather long timescale for these experiments .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the characteristic timescale over which the experiment of ref.@xcite was performed was significantly smaller than the timescale required to see the separate blobs merge .",
    "higher temperatures would enhance the dissipation in the gas and would decrease the characteristic time that is required for the blobs to merge . to the extent that the deviations from axial symmetry in the trapping potential and the antisymmetry in the initial configuration considered here are representative of the actual experimental situation , our results support the explanation offered in ref.@xcite .",
    "direct experimental determinations of these quantities and of the strength of dissipation would thus be welcome .",
    "it would also be of interest to investigate the long time stability ( or instability ) of the configurations observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the questions examined here may also have important consequences on possible technological applications .",
    "for example , propagation of such solitary waves in waveguides may serve as signals that transfer energy or information . therefore , understanding and possibly controlling the way that such waves interact with each other may be important .",
    "recent experimental progress in building quasi - one - dimensional and toroidal traps should make such experiments easier to perform and worth investigating .",
