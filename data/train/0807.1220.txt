    "the determination of @xmath1 , the ratio of the radiation - corrected hadronic cross section to the calculated lowest - order cross section for muon pair production is presented in two ranges of centre - of - mass energy , @xmath14 . the motivation for these studies is different in the two @xmath14 ranges .",
    "the measurements of @xmath1 at seven values of @xmath14 between 6.964 and 10.538  gev test the asymptotic freedom of the qcd coupling @xmath15 in the range of @xmath14 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , quarks are produced .",
    "the values of @xmath15 are extracted by comparing the measurements of @xmath1 to a perturbative qcd calculation at the four - loop level @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath1 in the region just above the @xmath20 threshold ( @xmath21 to 4.260  gev ) exhibit a rich structure ( for example see ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; this reflects the production of @xmath20 resonances .",
    "interesting features include an enhancement at @xmath8 threshold @xmath22 and a broad plateau beginning at the @xmath10 threshold @xmath23 .",
    "there is considerable theoretical interest in the composition of these enhancements @xcite .",

    "the cleo - c detector @xcite is used to study the data around @xmath20 threshold .",
    "the principal differences between the cleo iii and cleo - c detectors are the reduction in solenoid field from 1.5 to 1.0  t and the replacement of cleo iii s four - layer silicon - strip detector by a six - layer all - stereo inner drift chamber .",

    "hadronic events are selected from these data by placing criteria on individual tracks and showers , as well as the whole event .",
    "tracks used in the analysis are required to be of good quality , originate from close to the interaction point and have a momentum between 1 and 150% of the beam momentum .",
    "showers must have at least 1% of the beam momentum and not be associated with a track .",
    "several event variables are used to discriminate against background .",

    "the efficiency of the selection increases from 82.1% at @xmath28 to 87.4% at @xmath29 . the dominant background remaining after the event selection is from @xmath30 events , which is estimated from simulation .",
    "other remaining backgrounds are estimated to give contributions smaller than the systematic uncertainty assigned to the event selection .",
    "radiative corrections must be applied to the measured total hadronic cross section to determine @xmath1 .",
    "corrections are applied for soft photon radiation and vacuum polarisation .",
    "in addition , corrections are applied for hard initial state radiation to the continuum and lower mass @xmath31 resonances .",
    "furthermore , at three energy points , a correction is applied for the interference between a nearby @xmath32 resonance and the continuum .",
    "several sources of significant systematic uncertainty are considered : luminosity , radiative corrections , multiplicity corrections and event selection criteria .",
    "the relative uncertainty on the luminosity is between 0.9% and 1.1% depending on @xmath14 .",
    "the uncertainty from the radiative corrections is dominated by those for the hadronic vacuum polarisation , which has an uncertainty of 1.0% .",
    "some disagreement is found comparing the charged track multiplicity distribution in data and simulation .",
    "therefore , the efficiency is determined as a function of multiplicity before applying to the data .",
    "this procedure is estimated to have an uncertainty between 0.4% and 1.4% depending on @xmath14 . the uncertainty related to other selection criteria",
    "is estimated to be between 1.0 and 1.4% depending on @xmath14 .",

    "details of the uncertainty on the selection efficiency can be found in ref .",
    "the signal functions for the determination of @xmath3 and @xmath2 production mechanisms depend on the modelling of initial state radiation and the helicity amplitudes for @xmath61 ; variations of these models over a broad range of assumptions leads to the systematic uncertainty .",
    "variations in the @xmath60 and @xmath59 selection criteria are used to estimate the uncertainty related to signal extraction in the @xmath37 modes . the uncertainty on the normalisation arises from that on the measured luminosity and the branching fractions of the modes reconstructed @xcite .",
    "the total systematic uncertainties are between 3.4% and 6.8% for two - body production mechanisms ; the multi - body production mechanisms @xmath62 and @xmath13 have systematic uncertainties of 12% and 25% uncertainties , respectively .",

    "in addition , the total hadronic cross section is determined in a manner similar to that described in section  [ sec : cleoiii_r ] .",
