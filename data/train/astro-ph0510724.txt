    "studies made with the spitzer space telescope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this redshift range is somewhat higher than what optical surveys ( possibly affected by dust obscuration ) infer . at the same time",
    ", a more recent sub - mm study @xcite indicates no compelling evidence for the far infrared luminosity of radio sources to rise with redshift .",
    "the above observations have prompted investigations of the effect of rgs on cosmological evolution and distribution of large scale structures in the universe .",
    "preliminary work indicates that rgs can have substantial impacts on the formation , distribution and evolution of galaxies and large scale structures of the universe ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter gkw01 ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter gkw03 ; @xcite , hereafter gkwo ; @xcite , hereafter gkwb ; @xcite ) .",
    "one important aspect of this process is the role played by the huge expanding rg lobes in triggering extensive star formation in a multi - phase intergalactic medium .",

    "recently , @xcite also argued that efficient ultraluminous starbursts can be triggered by agn jets .",
    "a very significant fraction of the volume of the universe in which star formation has occurred was impinged upon by the growing radio lobes during the quasar era ( gkw01 and references therein ) .",
    "when these radio lobes propagating through the protogalactic medium envelop cooler clumps of gas embedded within the hotter gas which fills most of the volume , the initial bow shock compression triggers large - scale star formation , which is sustained by the persistent overpressure from the engulfing radio cocoon .",

    "for the radio lobes to have an important role in impacting star formation and spreading magnetic fields and metals , they need to occupy a significant portion of this relevant volume of baryons , which , however , was a small fraction of the total volume of the universe during most of the quasar epoch .",
    "a prerequisite for a more accurate computation of this rg impacted volume is a good model of the evolution of radio sources , both individually and as a function of @xmath6 .",

    "* ) indicate that radio source sizes grow in a more complex way than self - similar predictions , they are still reasonable approximations overall .",
    "the power evolutions in these models are dominated by adiabatic losses as the lobe expands , synchrotron radiation losses in the lobe magnetic field and inverse compton ( ic ) losses off the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",

    "however , to properly claim success for a theoretical model a _ quantitative _ statistical test is required ; we present some in this paper . a quantitative comparison of cosmological radio source evolution model predictions with an observational data sample ( the 3c data from @xcite ) has been done by @xcite .",

    " 5.3 ) we compared the model predictions with the observational samples as follows . in a single run a random initial population of millions of sources",
    "was generated such that after evolution of each source in the ensemble and after comparing each to the flux limits , the ensemble produced simulated samples ( for the 3c , 6c and 7c catalogs ) which were of sizes comparable to or larger than the real surveys .",
    "the simulated samples were then reduced in size , if necessary , by uniformly selecting sources from them . in particular , this was done by selecting every ( @xmath204)th source from a simulated survey , where @xmath205 is the number of sources in one of the real surveys 3c , 6c or 7c and @xmath206 ( usually @xmath207 ) , is the number of sources in the simulated survey .",
    "finally statistical tests ( whose results are tabulated ) were done on the @xmath208 $ ] data from the real surveys and a similar sized simulated sample generated from a single random seed .",

    "as a radio source gets older , its power ( @xmath19 ) vs. linear - size ( @xmath20 ) track becomes steeper .",
    "while this is true for all models , the rate of steepening is different in the three models , as seen from fig .  1 .",
    "these @xmath19@xmath20 tracks have been generated using the default parameters of each model ( given in table 1 ) , by allowing each source ( with beam powers and redshifts given in the plot ) to evolve at frequency @xmath211 mhz .",

    ", it is found that the luminosity falls off faster for sources with high power and high redshift . the higher the redshift of a radio source , the shorter the fraction of its life which can be detected by flux limited radio surveys .",
    "this point was noted by @xcite and was stressed by @xcite , who coined the phrase _ youth - redshift degeneracy _ to describe it .        for our first attempt to quantitatively compare the simulated radio surveys to the actual data , we used 1-dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov ( 1-d ks ) statistical tests .",
    "based on the results of such tests we chose some parameter variations for the models on which two more statistical tests were done (  5.3 ) . in the 1-d ks tests ,",
    "each of the distribution s key characteristics @xmath208 $ ] of the radio sources detected in the simulated surveys were compared to those of the sources in the real radio surveys 3c , 6c , and 7c , according to procedures given at the end of  4.3 .",
    "the ks probabilities , @xmath213 , that the two data sets being compared are drawn from the same distribution function , were taken to be a figure of merit of each model used in the simulation .",
    "high values of @xmath214 ( close to 1.0 ) indicate good fit , and very small @xmath214 imply that the model and data distributions are significantly different .",
    "we consider twelve test statistics in total ( the twelve probabilities found from the ks statistics for comparisons of each of @xmath215 for each of the three radio surveys ) , which quantifies the closeness of the model fits to the data .    in order to quantify the overall success of a model we would prefer to have a single figure - of - merit instead of twelve individual ones , but",
    "there is no obvious way to produce such a statistic , particularly since the three surveys have significantly different numbers of objects .",
    "a likelihood type test would involve the product instead of the sum of the ks probabilities , but given the extremely small values of these products we rejected this figure of merit as not providing a useful discrimination between the models .",
    "here we have combined the 1-d ks probabilities in two ways .",
    "first , we add the ks probability statistic for comparisons of @xmath215 ( i.e. @xmath216 ) for the three surveys , weighting the statistic of a survey by the square - root of the number of simulated sources detected in that survey .",
    "so the first overall figure of merit of a model , which we denote as @xmath217}$ ] , is given by : @xmath218 } =    % \\left [ { \\cal p}(p)+{\\cal p}(d)+{\\cal p}(z ) \\right]_{total } =    \\left [ { \\cal p}(p)+{\\cal p}(d)+{\\cal p}(z)+{\\cal p}(\\alpha ) \\right]_{3c } +   \\nonumber \\\\   \\sqrt{\\frac{n_{6c}}{n_{3c}}}\\left [ { \\cal p}(p)+{\\cal p}(d)+{\\cal p}(z)+{\\cal p}(\\alpha ) \\right]_{6c } + \\nonumber \\\\   \\sqrt{\\frac{n_{7c}}{n_{3c}}}\\left [ { \\cal p}(p)+{\\cal p}(d)+{\\cal p}(z)+{\\cal p}(\\alpha ) \\right]_{7c } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 are , respectively , the number of sources detected in each of the simulated surveys with a particular parameter set used in the model . as noted above ,",
    "if the simulations `` detect '' too many sources as compared to the data , then each of the resulting simulation survey samples for 3c , 6c , 7c are reduced by uniformly removing sources to make the final simulation sample sizes equal to that of the data samples .",
    "the second figure of merit we employ adds the ks statistic probabilities for @xmath19 and @xmath6 to twice the probability for @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath222 for the three surveys , using the same weighting method .",
    "we denote this as @xmath223}$ ] .",
    "this second choice was considered because results for @xmath19 and @xmath6 usually correlate ( due to flux - limit arguments ) ; thus double weighting the probability for @xmath20 dilutes the impact of the @xmath224 $ ] correlation . unsurprisingly , in most of the runs we have performed the combined test statistics @xmath217}$ ] and @xmath223}$ ] behaved in a similar fashion .",
    "unfortunately , for the complicated problem of radio source cosmological evolution , which involves many parameters and several dimensions , any figure of merit based upon 1-d ks tests is a crude approach in comparing models with observations .",
    "we attempted to use multi - dimensional statistical tests ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which , in principle , could yield a more robust single figure of merit for the fit of our distributions to the data in @xmath225 $ ] space . unfortunately , the limited sizes of the observational samples ( @xmath226 ) preclude obtaining reliable results from such generalizations of the ks test . here",

    "the main problem is that too many high-@xmath6 and too few low-@xmath6 sources were produced by the models as compared to the data .",

    "the @xmath19 and @xmath6 fits were best for @xmath238 , making the overall performance look fairly good , but the @xmath20 fits were all very bad .",
    "as will be discussed further below , the former modification ( @xmath235 ) produced a clear overall improvement for the brw model too .",

    "simulations were done by setting the parameter values at the end points of physically reasonable ranges ; for example we might perform two additional runs using the same initial population but we would set a parameter to half or twice its default value .",

    "we performed simulation runs with default parameters for each of the models , using initial populations with @xmath239 ( which gives the least bad fits ) ; we then set @xmath37 to values in the range 50 - 600 myr ( in intervals of 50 myr ) , and obtained the following results .",
    "for the kda model , the combined ks probabilities , @xmath217}$ ] or @xmath223}$ ] lacked a single maximum over the range in maximum age considered , and peaked at both 150 myr and 500 myr .",

    "the actual survey data has negligible numbers of such small sources which would not normally be considered fr ii types . as any such small source ( with @xmath245 kpc )",
    "will not be regarded as a fr ii radio galaxy , we decided to put a linear size cut - off in our simulations .",
    "for the kda and mk models a cut - off of 1 kpc was adopted . for the brw model we found that a cut - off of 10 kpc gave much better fits than did a 1 kpc cut - off .",
    "so in brw we considered sources only with total linear sizes greater than 10 kpc .",
    "the kda and mk simulations did not produce many sources with linear size @xmath246 kpc , hence it did not make much of a difference if we imposed a 10 kpc or a 1 kpc size cut - off . in the results presented henceforth , these @xmath20 cut - offs have been incorporated .      in order to further explore the parameter space of the models in search of better fits ,",
    "initial ensembles were generated using @xmath235 , @xmath244 myr for the kda and mk , and @xmath235 , @xmath247 myr for the brw simulations ( see  5.2.3 ) .",
    "the following prespription was then followed for each .",
    "the sources in one large random population were evolved several times , according to one of the three radio lobe power evolution models . during each evolution one of the model parameter values",
    "was varied around its default value ( as in  5.2.2 ) .",
    "all the parameters of each model given in table 1 were varied , with only one variation per evolution run .",
    "only those parameter variations that gave any improvement in statistics over the default parameter case of the same model , or were essentially as good as the default , were considered further . for these",
    "parameter sets three more initial populations were generated having the same size and the same @xmath66 and @xmath37 values for the different models , but with different pseudo - random seeds .",
    "these additional ensembles were then evolved using the `` improved '' parameter sets for each model , and the 1-d ks statistics were found . at this point we had the ks test results for a set of four simulations of each of the `` improved '' parameter variations .",
    "the three cases involving variations of a single parameter ( previous paragraph ) which gave the best statistics ( highest mean @xmath217}$ ] of the 4 runs ) were then found .",
    "simulations were then performed in which two of those parameter changes giving better fits were simultaneously employed .",
    "if these `` 2-change '' variations continued to give better performances , all three changes were incorporated together in a single run , to see if yet better fits could be obtained .",
    "the spectral index ( @xmath12 ) at the rest frame of a source at 151 mhz was estimated for each source in the simulated surveys by considering @xmath248 [ @xmath131 ( mhz ) ] as the independent variable and @xmath249 as the dependent .",
    "the specific powers at the @xmath63 corresponding to the source (  4.3 ) were calculated at three frequencies , namely , @xmath174 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 mhz .",
    "a quadratic polynomial was fitted to the @xmath249 vs. @xmath248 [ @xmath131 ( mhz ) ] data .",
    "the fit coefficients @xmath252 and @xmath253 where @xmath254 , were obtained . these were used to find the spectral index as @xmath255 .",
    "the ks tests for the fits for the spectral index ( @xmath12 ) for all surveys employing each model are uniformly bad ( as indicated from the @xmath231 values in tables 3  5 ) .",
    "the poor qualitative fits to the @xmath12 distribution were already noted by @xcite for their models .",
    "still , it is the brw model which gives the least unsatisfactory ks statistics for @xmath12 fits .",
    "the ks statistics for @xmath12 fits were extremely bad for the kda model . here",
    ", the spectral index distributions consist of a dense cluster at @xmath256 , with no sources having smaller @xmath12 while some have steeper spectral indices up to @xmath257 .",
    "there is a weak @xmath258 anti - correlation until @xmath259 kpc , after which there is a trend of increasing @xmath12 as @xmath20 increases ; but this involves only a few giant sources .",
    "the brw model also produced mostly very poor @xmath12 fits , but occasionally it gave quasi - acceptable ks statistics , with @xmath260 . here",
    ", the spectral indices are almost uniformly distributed within @xmath261 , with some sources at smaller @xmath12 .",
    "there is also a weak @xmath258 anti - correlation in the brw model which extends throughout the simulated results .",
    "the mk model produced the worst ks statistics for @xmath12 . here",
    ", the spectral indices came out very steep , with @xmath262 almost always found .",
    "the distribution includes a cluster at @xmath263 , and an extension to very steep spectra @xmath264 .",
    "here there is a clear trend for @xmath12 to be higher as @xmath20 increases in the simulations for all three catalogs .",
    "thus , it is clear that all of the models considered to date require modifications if they are to produce adequate representations of the observed radio spectral indices .",
    "making such modifications is a key goal of our future work .      in order to check the robustness of the quantitative tests we performed some additional statistical analyses .",
    "we selected the cases of parameter variations that gave the highest combined probability , @xmath217}$ ] , of each model , according to the amplified 1-d ks test results ( described in  5.2.4 ) .",
    "we compared these nominally superior parameter sets for each model with the default versions ( those with no parameter changes ) by performing additional statistical tests on them .",
    "we used the 2-dimensional ( 2-d ) ks test procedure from @xcite , which is based on the work of @xcite , which is a variant of an earlier idea due to @xcite .",
    "the relevant 2-dimensional 2-sample ks probabilities ( or the significance level indicating that the two populations are drawn from the same distribution ) , @xmath214 , give a quantitative measure of the model fits . the comparisons of the model simulated samples to the real data samples are done in a way analogous to that for the 1-d ks tests (  4.3 ) .",
    "the 2-d ks probabilities for comparisons of the properties @xmath265 and @xmath12 , taken two at a time , for the data and the models , were computed . table 6 shows results for both the default versions and the parameter sets giving the highest total 1-d ks probability , denoted as _ varied _ in the table .",
    "the results are listed in a similar way as are the 1-d ks statistics in previous tables .",
    "the first column gives the model and parameter variation ( if any ) .",
    "the third , fourth , fifth , sixth , seventh and eighth columns list the ks probabilities for comparisons of @xmath266 $ ] , @xmath267 $ ] , @xmath268 $ ] , @xmath269 $ ] , @xmath270 $ ] and @xmath271 $ ] respectively ; in each case the three rows give results for 3c , 6c and 7c , respectively .",
    "it is non - trivial to compare the models as there are 18 values of @xmath214 which must be considered .",
    "the general trends are discussed in  6 .",
    "we considered the spearman partial rank correlation coefficients between the four relevant source characteristics @xmath265 and @xmath12 .",
    "following @xcite , we calculated the partial rank correlation coefficients with four variables , e.g. , @xmath272^{1/2}},\\ ] ] for the correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 independent of @xmath6 and @xmath12 . here",
    "the three - variable partial correlation coefficient is @xmath273 with @xmath274 being the spearman correlation coefficient between two variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the significance level associated with the 4-variable correlation is @xmath275 where , @xmath205 is the size of the sample considered .",
    "the relevant spearman partial rank correlation coefficients involving @xmath208 $ ] for the data and for the models for those cases for which the 2-d ks tests were done are given in table 7 .",
    "the four - variable correlation coefficients ( @xmath276 , etc ) were computed by combining the observed data or the model `` simulated '' data for all the relevant surveys : 3c , 6c and 7c iii .",
    "we do so in order to dilute the tight @xmath266 $ ] correlation in a single flux - limited complete sample ( brw ) , and to detect the correlations which exist between other characteristics .",
    "the 2-variable correlation , @xmath274 , was always negative ; however , in the 4-variable case , with the effects of @xmath6 and @xmath12 removed , @xmath277 showed a small positive correlation .",
    "we also examined the correlation coefficients of the data and model simulations in each survey , 3c , 6c , or 7c , separately .",
    "we have performed quantitative tests of three detailed models for rg evolution .",
    "this is the first attempt to perform such statistical tests involving 4 radio source observables over 3 complete radio surveys . during our multi - dimensional monte carlo simulation procedure we found that it is very difficult to get acceptable simultaneous fits to the radio properties @xmath265 and @xmath12 for all three redshift complete subsamples of the 3c , 6c and 7c radio catalogs",
    "this is true using either the default parameters suggested by each of these three leading models , or when considering extensive variations upon them involving changing one or more of the parameters to plausible different values .",
    "usually the @xmath19 and @xmath6 fits were correlated , due to flux limiting arguments discussed before .",
    "the fits to the 6c survey were generally better compared to those for 3c and 7c ; this is because of the smaller number of sources in the 6c catalog and the nature of the ks test .",
    "our weighting of the `` total 1-d ks probability '' by the square root of the number of sources helps to compensate for this .",
    "it was most difficult to get acceptable fits to the faintest sources cataloged in 7c .    when varying the model parameters from their default values the greatest improvement came from steepening the power law index for the initial beam power distribution to @xmath239 from @xmath232 used by @xcite .",
    "this change improved the kda and mk model performances greatly ( tables 3 and 5 ) .",
    "the ks statistics for the brw models were never wonderful , especially the @xmath20 fits ( table 4 ) ; nonetheless , varying the maximum age assumed for the sources from 500 myr to 150 myr for the kda and mk models and to 250 myr for the brw model also produced better fits .",
    "we found the following trends for the ratios of number of sources detected in the 6c and 7c simulations and the number in the actual catalogs , as compared to 3c ( ratio@xmath278 and ratio@xmath279 respectively ) .",
    "for the kda and brw models , the detection number ratio was more consistent for 6c than for 7c simulations ; i.e. , ratio@xmath278 was closer to 1.0 ( which it should equal ideally ) than was ratio@xmath279 . for the mk model , the detection number ratios for 6c and 7c ( which were in the range @xmath280 ) were equally consistent .",
    "though we calculated the detection number ratios , we do not display them nor did we formally consider them in comparing the models .",
    "these ratios can be made closer to 1 by varying the redshift birth function or the rlf ( eq .  1 ) , and so are not good tests of the models per se .    from the 2-d ks test results we find that the @xmath266 $ ] , @xmath267 $ ] and @xmath268 $ ] planes can be reasonably fitted by the `` varied '' models , particularly those for kda and mk .",
    "most of those probabilities are @xmath281 for the kda and most exceed 0.05 for mk .",
    "all of the @xmath214 s of the `` varied '' brw model not involving @xmath12 are higher than those of the default brw model .",
    "improvements are also seen for all of the non-@xmath12 mk @xmath214 s using the `` varied '' model .",
    "this is the case for only 7 of 9 @xmath214 s of the kda `` varied '' model .",
    "these models can not fit any plane involving @xmath12 , with all the @xmath12-related 2-d ks probabilities @xmath282 for every model .",
    "these 2-d results provide support for the hypothesis that the `` varied '' models based on 1-d ks tests are indeed better fits . by comparing the values of 2-d ks probabilities in the models of table 6 ,",
    "we conclude that kda model is the best ( having the highest number of @xmath214 s close to 1 ) in fitting the observational data , very closely followed by mk , and finally brw .    from the 4-variable correlation coefficient results ( table 7 )",
    "we see that the kda model is able to match the survey data correlations very closely ( at least for @xmath265 ) .",
    "the matches to the data correlations are less good for the brw and mk models .",
    "the parameter variation cases which were the best fits ( i.e. , gave highest combined @xmath217}$ ] ) when judged with respect to 1-d and 2-d ks tests , are not necessarily the better cases according to the correlation analyses .",
    "the kda default performs better than the kda _ varied _",
    "( 1-d ks best fit ) case . for brw and mk models , the default and",
    "the _ varied _ cases perform comparably ( i.e. , sometimes the default verison is a better match to the data correlations and sometimes the _ varied _ fit is better ) .    considering the signs of the four - variable coefficients , the mk model predicts @xmath283 $ ] anti - correlation and @xmath284 $ ] correlation which are trends opposite to the survey data and to the other models .",
    "the sign of the @xmath285 $ ] correlation of the surveys is only predicted by mk , while the other models produce an anti - correlation ; however , given the very poor @xmath12 distribution for the mk model this advantage is meaningless .    from the correlation coefficient analyses we conclude that the kda model fits the data most closely , followed by brw , and finally mk .",
    "similar trends are also seen if we examine the coefficients obtained by considering each survey separately .",
    "we plotted slices through the @xmath286 $ ] volume ( @xmath19 vs @xmath6 , @xmath19 vs @xmath20 , @xmath20 vs @xmath6 , and @xmath12 vs @xmath6 ) for each of the simulated surveys , and examined their consistency by comparing them with the overall trends in the @xmath286 $ ] planes of the actual data .",
    "the actual data is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the simulated data are shown in figs 3 , 4 and 5 for the kda , brw and mk models , respectively .",
    "the plotted simulations are for one of the best ( in a statistical sense ) parameter sets for each model .",
    "plots for other good parameter values appear similar , while those for worse parameters ( according to our ks summary statistic ) look less like the data .",
    "sources are detected out to similar values of redshift , power and size in the 3c simulations as in the data .",
    "the kda and mk models show very similar trends in @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the unique features of the brw model results are discussed below .",
    "unsurprisingly , the values of @xmath19 and @xmath6 exist in a cluster in the @xmath287 plane , above a lower curve determined by the flux limit of the survey .",
    "all of our simulated surveys of all models miss many of the low @xmath6 - low @xmath19 sources seen in the data .",
    "very high @xmath6 sources ( @xmath288 ) are underproduced in all the 7c simulations , and a similar , but less pronounced , trend is also present for 6c .",
    "all the 3c simulations present a greater scatter in @xmath19 for high @xmath19 ",
    "high @xmath6 sources ( @xmath289 ) when compared to the data .",
    "a few powerful , high @xmath6 sources are detected in the 3c simulations at @xmath290 which are not present in the data .",
    "the scatter in @xmath19 is naturally less in the 6c survey because of the upper ( as well as lower ) flux limit .",
    "examining the @xmath240 planes of the simulations , we find that the kda and mk models overproduce small and large high power sources in 3c , and underproduce the large weaker sources .",
    "the underproduction of low @xmath6 sources is manifested in the @xmath240 planes of the 6c and 7c simulations as the absence of less powerful sources ( due to the @xmath287 correlation ) .",
    "there is a strong @xmath240 evolution seen in the brw model , which is most pronounced in the 3c and 6c simulations .",
    "the 3c simulation overproduces powerful smaller sources and misses several large ones .",
    "the 6c and 7c simulations underproduce less powerful , smaller sources . again , the kda and mk models show too weak @xmath240 anti - correlations than does the data ( at least for 3c ) , whereas the brw model shows too strong an anti - correlation .",
    "the 6c and 7c simulations show a paucity of low @xmath6 and high @xmath6 sources in the @xmath291 planes of all the models .",
    "the kda and mk models overproduce very small and very large 3c sources at all redshifts .",
    "the brw simulation presents a stronger anti - correlation of linear size with redshift , specially for 3c , where there are no large sources at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the @xmath291 evolution ( decrease of @xmath20 as @xmath6 increases ) occurs due to imposing survey flux limits .",
    "this is a ramification of the `` youth -redshift degeneracy '' discussed in  5.1 .",
    "the high redshift sources show a very steep decline of their luminosities with age ( seen from the @xmath240 tracks in fig .  1 ) and fall below the survey flux limits at young ages , as their radiating particles undergo severe inverse compton losses off the cmb and adiabatic expansion losses as they are transported from the high pressure hotspot to the lobes .",
    "thus , we can only detect these high @xmath6 sources at an early age when they are still above the limiting survey flux .",
    "these younger high @xmath6 sources are naturally smaller and yield the weak `` linear size evolution '' ( seen in the @xmath291 plane ) .",
    "both the kda and mk simulations do not show this effect as clearly as does the actual data . on the other hand ,",
    "the brw simulations show stronger @xmath291 anti - correlations than do the data .",
    "there are several observational features ( including trends in the @xmath286 $ ] planes of the data samples ) that can not be explained by any models considered so far .",
    "the @xmath267 $ ] diagram for the 3crr data show a clear anti - correlation with large scatter .",
    "another interesting feature is the clump of sources in the 6ce @xmath267 $ ] diagram near @xmath292 kpc , @xmath293 w hz@xmath2 sr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "neither of these is reproduced in the models .",
    "the kda and mk model simulations predict too many very large @xmath294 mpc and powerful sources ( more in 3c , some in 7c ) , which are not present in the data .",
    "this feature has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the brw @xmath229 were very low for many cases ( especially for 3c ) , and the brw @xmath267 $ ] diagrams for all 3 simulated surveys showed too strong a @xmath267 $ ] anti - correlation .",
    "this arises because the brw model simulations produce too many small but powerful sources .",
    "a possible explanation of this problem could be synchrotron self - absorption of the radiation emitted by such small powerful sources , which is not included in the model .",
    "thus some small sources should fall below the survey flux limit at a frequency of @xmath174 mhz . including this effect could improve the relative performance of the brw model .",
    "an important point to remember is that all three models considered here are incomplete in the sense that they do not incorporate enough physics to predict the complete physical conditions prevailing in fr ii radio sources .",
    "consideration of additional factors may be necessary in these models .",
    "first , the environmental density ( @xmath295 ) could vary with redshift and it must eventually deviate from its power law behavior with distance .",
    "the beam power @xmath296 distribution might vary with redshift and the maximum lifetime of agn activity ( @xmath37 ) could vary with redshift and jet power . also , the birth function of radio sources with redshift ( rlf ) , could have a greater variation with luminosity .",
    "we have compared the leading models of radio lobe power evolution for fr ii rgs , namely the kda , brw and mk models , using a simulated radio survey prescription ( following brw ) .",
    "each of the dozens of simulated radio surveys we computed required the generation and analysis of a few @xmath193 to @xmath297 radio sources and hence substantial amounts of computing power .",
    "the total number of monte carlo simulations done exceeded @xmath298 and over a billion individual rgs were evolved ; this was necessary to narrow down the set of parameters for each model to the `` best fit '' ranges described in the present work .",
    "one - dimensional ks tests were done to narrow down the parameters of the different models to locate more desirable ones .",
    "these preferred parameter sets of the models were then compared with the data by using 2-d ks tests , and correlation coefficient analyses .",
    "hydrodynamical modeling of classical double radio sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that the pressure in the nearly self - similarly growing lobes falls with time while the hotspot pressure does not vary much .",
    "the @xcite model examined here assumed that the head pressure falls with time ( and is proportional to that of the cocoon ) , so this is a weakness of that model . @xcite adopted a constant hotspot pressure ( implying more adiabatic losses for particles in the hotspot of older sources ) while considering the adiabatic expansion of particles out of the hotspots to the lobes .",
    "they showed a rough qualitative agreement between their simulated and real 3c and 7c data in the @xmath299 $ ] space .",
    "@xcite modified the brw picture by proposing an acceleration mechanism occurring throughout the head region ; they obtained @xmath267 $ ] tracks in somewhat better accord with 3crr data , but did not consider @xmath286 $ ] distributions .",
    "our much more extensive simulations and statistical analyses , based on ks tests and correlation coefficients , provides a quantitative way to directly compare these three models .",
    "we note that despite the hundreds of simulations we computed which did employ substantial variations on the default parameters for each rg model ( only a portion of which are displayed in this paper ) we could not completely cover the entire plausible parameter space .",
    "we also note that other figures of merit could have been devised to distinguish between the goodness of fits of the data to the various simulation results , since no really suitable multi - parameter statistic is available for samples of this size . keeping these caveats in mind ,",
    "we believe both that we have covered the vast majority of the sensible parameter ranges and that our choice of combined ks probabilities is a good way to compare different simulations . in this spirit , we now present our conclusions comparing how the models performed in different aspects of consistency between the simulations and data .",
    "our key result is somewhat disappointing . despite investigating a wide range of parameters",
    "we find that no existing model gives excellent fits to all the data simultaneously .",
    "however , from the statistical test results , the kda model appears to give better fits than do the brw or mk models . explicitly judging from the 1-d ks test results , the mk model frequently produces acceptable statistics for @xmath19 , @xmath6 and @xmath20 .",
    "the kda simulations also often give adequate statistics .",
    "the brw simulations do not give as good statistics as do the mk and kda models .",
    "after incorporating the 10 kpc linear size cut - off the statistics for some brw models improve , but are still not as good as those given by the other two models . according ot the 2-d ks test results , the kda model fits the data most closely , then comes mk , and finally brw . from both the 1-d and 2-d ks test results , planes in the @xmath300 $ ] space",
    "can be reasonably fitted by some parameter variation of the models ( fits determined by higher values of the ks probabilities ) , but it is difficult to get acceptable @xmath12 fits .",
    "both the ks tests dictate that the `` varied '' model parameters of all the models ( tables 6 and 7 ) are better fits to the data as compared to the default parameter values .",
    "however , in terms of reproducing the correlations between the source properties ( spearman partial rank correlation coefficient ) , the default models perform better than ( kda ) or comparable to ( brw , mk ) the `` varied '' models .",
    "the kda model correlations match the survey data correlations most closely , followed by brw and then mk .    our analyses used the redshift birth function of radio sources from @xcite s radio luminosity function .",
    "we conclude that , using @xcite s rlf , the kda and mk models perform better than brw in fitting the 3crr , 6ce and 7crs survey data when compared with respect to ks - based statistical tests , and the kda model provides the best fits to the correlation coefficients .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers which aim at comparing the performances of radio source evolution models .",
    "our goal is to develop one which is a good fit to all the observational data .",
    "we are performing similar tests on a modified model we are developing , whose results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "this new model incorporates conical jet expansion for a fraction of a radio source s lifetime within the brw and mk models .",
    "this allows us to incorporate a variable hotspot size in the models , which is supported by observations @xcite . here",
    "the hotspot pressure varies as a function of the linear size or the source age , which is a more practical possibility for hotspots of rgs evolving over 100s of myr .    in the future",
    ", we plan to extend this work by allowing redshift variations in the environmental density profile ( in particular , we will allow for variations of @xmath74 , @xmath73 and @xmath72 with cosmic epoch ) .",
    "we also will consider jet propagation through ambient media which change from power law density decline to constant densities ( which change with @xmath6 ) at scales around 100 kpc .",
    "@xcite gives preliminary work on the implications of the volumes attained by radio sources considering cosmological evolution of the ambient gas density .",
    "our final aim is to estimate the volume fraction of the relevant universe occupied by radio lobes , and hence to test the robustness of the exciting , but preliminary , conclusion that expanding radio galaxies play a significant role in the cosmological history of the universe .",
