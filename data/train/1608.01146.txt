    "the chemistry of metal clusters on graphene involves complex bonding between metal clusters and gas molecules when gases such as hydrogen are introduced , resulting in difficulty of experimental measurements and analysis .",
    "in particular , hydrogen adsorption on graphene  supported metal clusters often leads to controversial arguments over how hydrogen is adsorbed , whether the hydrogen adsorption takes place on the metal clusters or on defect sites of graphene , whether spillover effects occur , and what types of bonds between hydrogen and metal are formed .",

    "the resulting temperature - dependent desorption curve is shown in fig .",

    "the tds spectrum presents three hydrogen desorption peaks .",

    "this quantity can be used to evaluate the gravimetric density ( @xmath32 ) of the system , i.e. , the ratio of loaded hydrogen mass over total system mass ( from now on , we consider hydrogen and not deuterium ) . the general formula for @xmath32 can then be written as @xmath33 with @xmath34 the mass of titanium ( @xmath35 ) , graphene ( @xmath36 ) , and hydrogen ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "@xmath31  h@xmath0 molecules have a mass of @xmath38 kg .",
    "the sample has a size of 12.4  mm@xmath39 , and graphene a mass density of @xmath40 kg / m@xmath39,@xcite which results in a mass of the graphene of @xmath41 kg . on the same sample area , 0.84 ml of ti correspond to @xmath42 atoms , corresponding to a weight of @xmath43 kg . using eq .",

    "the approximate desorption energy barriers @xmath45 from the measured desorption temperatures @xmath46 were then estimated .",
    "first - order desorption is assumed , based on the reported molecule - like dimer arrangement of hydrogen atoms on graphene,@xcite and similar to what has been observed for hydrogen release from graphite@xcite and rh(110).@xcite defining @xmath47 as the time from the start of the desorption ramp to the moment at which the desorption temperature @xmath46 is reached , @xmath47 equals @xmath48 with @xmath49 the temperature at the start of the ramp ( here @xmath50  k ) and @xmath51 the heating rate ( here @xmath52  k / s ) .",

    "this desorption peak can therefore be classified as related to physisorption ( @xmath60  ev / molecule ) . on the other hand , for the desorption peaks at 420  k and 580",
    "k @xmath61  ev / molecule or 0.55 ev / atom and @xmath62  ev / molecule = 0.75 ev / atom were obtained , respectively , suggesting these peaks are related to chemisorption ( @xmath63  ev / molecule ) . in using the redhead equation,@xcite the same values for the desorption energy barriers were obtained .",
    "these estimates of the relation between desorption temperature and desorption barrier are also consistent with other values reported for hydrogen desorption from various materials.@xcite    these multiple hydrogen release peaks address a controversial issue relating to the hydrogen adsorption sites . the location of such sites is often debated to be either on the graphene side or the metal side @xcite .",
    "calculations provide controversial predictions , suggesting that multi ",
    "bonding states between hydrogen and ti clusters might be involved .    in order to reveal the details of the interaction between hydrogen and ti clusters on graphene , hydrogen adsorption over ti@xmath17 @xmath18 clusters on graphene",
    "is simulated .",
    "hydrogen adsorption at various adsorption sites is considered : on clean graphene , on graphene with a defect site , on graphene with a defect site which is filled by a ti@xmath64 cluster , and on ti@xmath17 @xmath18 clusters on graphene .",
    "hydrogen adsorption is performed by adding molecular h@xmath0 in a stepwise manner until the ti@xmath17 clusters are fully hydrogenated .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , the hydrogen desorption energy on clean graphene is calculated to be 27 kj / mol ( or 0.28 ev / h@xmath0 ) , which indicates that hydrogen is adsorbed on graphene by physisorption . on the other hand , hydrogen adsorption at the defect in graphene has a relatively high desorption energy of 313 kj / mol . here h@xmath0 is dissociated and adsorbed as h atoms at the edge of the defect .",
    "these cases represent the two different bond types , namely physisorption and chemisorption , that occur during hydrogen and graphene interaction , where physisorption is based on weak van der waals forces between the h@xmath0 molecule and graphene , while chemisorption is based on c  h chemical bonds that form after h@xmath0 molecule dissociation .",
    "conversely , the hydrogen desorption energy from a ti@xmath64 cluster occupying a defect site in graphene is significantly low at 3 kj / mol .",
    "this could be attributed to the strong bond between ti@xmath64 and the defect site of graphene mediated by a charge transfer .",
    "calculated desorption energies for hydrogen adsorbed on clean graphene , defect site of graphene , defect site of graphene filled with ti@xmath64 cluster , and ti@xmath17 @xmath18 clusters on graphene .",
    "strong ionic character and weak ionic character represent chemisorption while physisorption is mediated by van der waals force.,width=85 ]    according to the first principle calculations , hydrogen adsorption on ti@xmath64 clusters on graphene is governed by physisorption as no charge transfer is involved between h@xmath0 molecules and ti .",
    "this is in agreement with previous work showing that up to four h@xmath0 molecules can be stored by single graphene  supported ti atoms @xcite .",
    "however , larger clusters ti@xmath17 @xmath65 behave differently .",
    "ti@xmath0 induces dissociative adsorption of the first h@xmath0 with 0.5 electrons transfered from ti@xmath0 to each h atom .",
    "this behavior , previously observed in isolated small ti clusters @xcite , can be described as a polarized covalent bond with partial ionic character .",
    "the second and third h@xmath0 are weakly adsorbed in molecular form where electron transfer between ti and h@xmath0 is not involved .",
    "a similar behavior is also observed for hydrogen adsorption on ti@xmath17 @xmath66 .",
    "structural details of the different bond types between hydrogen and ti@xmath16 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c  e ) .",
    "chemical bonding is seen in ti@xmath16:1h@xmath0 where h@xmath0 is dissociated and adsorbed as h atoms , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) .",
    "a weaker bonding is observed in ti@xmath16:4h@xmath0 . though the molecules are fully dissociated , the charge transfer and ionic character slightly decrease , and the binding energy is lower . as more h@xmath0 molecules",
    "are added , the physical character of the interaction prevails , forming a shell of physisorbed molecules as in ti@xmath16:9h@xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](e ) .",
    "bader charge analysis provides further information for an understanding of the multi - bonding between hydrogen and ti clusters .",
    "two regimes of charge transfer from h to ti are identified , namely `` strong '' in the range of @xmath67 electrons / h and `` weak '' with @xmath68 electrons / h ; for physisorption , a charge transfer is not involved .",
    "in addition , bader analysis reveals interesting results in hydrogen adsorption at the defected site of the graphene where h is positively charged by 0.5 electron which is the opposite charge state of hydrogen on ti clusters .",
    "as the size of the ti clusters grows , not only can more hydrogen be adsorbed but also the number of hydrogen atoms that fit in each type of bond increases .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] : a ti@xmath16 cluster , for example , can store up to 9 hydrogen molecules .",
    "first principle calculations reveals that positively charged ti clusters are not able to dissociate h@xmath0 , leading to a weak h@xmath0 adsorption through physisorption , while neutral ti clusters tend to transfer their electrons towards h@xmath0 , resulting in h@xmath0 dissociation and chemical bonding of h. similar results were reported for ti clusters adsorbed on fullerenes.@xcite one can conclude that the bond type between h@xmath0 and ti clusters is strongly dependent on the charge state of the ti clusters . in particular",
    ", initially introduced h@xmath0 tends to dissociate and be adsorbed through chemical bonding due to the large charge transfer from the ti clusters . as the number of adsorbed h@xmath0 on the ti cluster increases , the strength and the ionic character of the bonds between h@xmath0 and the ti cluster weakens .",
    "once ti clusters are fully positively charged , h@xmath0 is then adsorbed in molecular form via physisorption . as a result ,",
    "three bonding regions are both observed in experiment and calculations as shown in figures [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] , respectively .",
    "thus , the link between experimental hydrogen desorption shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and three different types of bonding between hydrogen and ti clusters based on first principle calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] is established .",
    "in addition , the gravimetric density of hydrogen is evaluated where hydrogen storage capacity is estimated to be 5.1% , corresponding to 2.4 hydrogen molecules for each ti atom , in line with previous studies of ti functionalized graphene on sic@xcite and above the values obtained for non - functionalized graphene based materials in same conditions ( @xmath691% at rt).@xcite a rough estimation of the corresponding volumetric density leads to an optimal value @xmath690.2",
    "kg / l , which would allow interesting automotive applications .",
    "this however implies the capability of building 3d frameworks with controllable inter - layer spacing or porosity ( a value of @xmath69 1 nm is assumed in the estimate ) .",
    "therefore , future developments of these studies for h - storage applications shall involve not only the optimization of the ti clusters concentration and distribution , but also the chemical functionalization of the sheets aimed at building 3d frameworks with controlled structural properties .",
    "in conclusion , the bonding mechanisms between hydrogen and graphene  supported ti clusters are experimentally and theoretically investigated .",
    "ti clusters are synthesized on graphene using vacuum deposition techniques .",
    "tem confirms that nanometer ",
    "sized ti clusters are formed on graphene .",
    "tds shows that three hydrogen desorption peaks from hydrogenated ti clusters occur .",
    "first principle calculations reveal three bond types : chemical bonding with strong ionic character , weak chemical bonding with smaller ionic character , and physisorption .",
    "in particular , we show that the physical origin for this rests on the charge state of the ti clusters .",
    "when ti clusters are neutral , h@xmath0 is dissociated and adsorbed through ionic bonding , while h@xmath0 is adsorbed in molecular form over positively charged ti clusters .",
