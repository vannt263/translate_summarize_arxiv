    "in perturbative double compton scattering @xcite , an incoming photon interacts with an electron , and two photons are emitted .",
    "this process , which is represented by the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fg ] , can be described by perturbative quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and requires no other special theoretical input .",
    "experimental evidence ranges from the first measurements more than 50 years ago  @xcite to the more recent  @xcite .",
    "however , if the emission process takes place inside an intense laser field , then the physics changes , and the electron line is dressed by multiple interactions with the laser field ( see fig .  [ fig_feynman_diag ] ) .",
    "the emission of two photons is a purely quantum process which can not be described by classical radiation theory  @xcite .",
    "an exception is encountered only for the case of the sequential emission of two quanta which occurs when the intermediate propagator hits a resonance pole , given by a resonant dirac ",
    "volkov state . in that case ,",
    "to which we will return to later in the paper , the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_feynman_diag ] break apart into two distinctive blocks for the emission of the two photons .",
    ", final four momentum @xmath0 ) .",
    "the electron line is denoted by a single customary fermion line .",
    "the frequencies of the two emitted photons with wave four vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 may be different and thus may be their wavelengths ; this is explicitly indicated in the panel .",
    "[ fg ] ]    the most interesting geometry for the process is the backscattering case , where a relativistic electron counterpropagates against an intense laser beam of comparatively low frequency ( on the order of a few ev ) . in ordinary compton scattering ,",
    "the electron is usually assumed to be at rest , and the scattering of a highly energetic photon is considered . because the kinematics is inverted in the backscattering case , one sometimes refers to this scenario as `` inverse compton scattering '' . during the emission",
    ", the electron interacts with the laser field via an arbitrary number of interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_feynman_diag ] ) ; the process can be described by fully laser - dressed dirac ",
    "volkov propagators @xcite .",
    "so , we may refer to the process depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_feynman_diag ] as `` inverse laser - dressed double compton backscattering . ''    ]    note that for a single - photon compton backscattering , the highest photon energy attainable is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the laser photon energy and @xmath5 is the lorentz factor of the incoming electron . for a defined scattering geometry , the energy of the emitted photon thus is uniquely defined , and it coincides with the energy of the emitted classical ( larmor ) radiation in the specified direction provided the laser photon energy is much smaller than the electron mass and lorentz boost factors are taken into account . if the electron absorbs @xmath6 laser photons during laser - dressed single compton scattering , the energy maximum changes to @xmath7 , where the laser intensity parameter @xmath8 is defined in eq .   below",
    "( @xmath9 is proportional to the laser intensity ) .",
    "when two photons are emitted in laser - dressed double compton scattering , their maximum energy sum is limited by @xmath10 . as we will show , it is possible to designate energy and angular regions in which the double scattering process dominates over single scattering , which is crucial for an experimental verification  @xcite .    interestingly , as noted in @xcite , the two photons emitted during the process are entangled because of the quantum nature of the process . in order to quantify the entanglement , the emission directions of the two quanta can not be used with good effect , because they represent continuous variables in three dimensions .",
    "however , the polarization components of the two photons along the emission lines can be uniquely decomposed in a two - dimensional space composed of unit vectors ( effectively a one - dimensional space ) , and measured independently . triggering on simultaneous two - photon events",
    ", one can then measure the entanglement quantitatively : an appropriate measure is the so - called concurrence @xcite which measures the polarization entanglement of the two quanta .    the usual double compton scattering , which involves the absorption of only one laser photon , has a rate which is proportional to the square of the laser four - vector amplitude , i.e. , proportional to its intensity .",
    "therefore , we may refer to the single scattering process as the `` linear '' process . with rising laser intensity",
    ", the rate deviates from the simple linear intensity dependence , it becomes more and more indispensable to include higher - order effects , and the process becomes nonlinear .    in order to bring the current investigation into perspective , we would like to mention other work performed in connection with two - photon emission from free electrons : indeed , a pair of photons may be produced by electrons accelerated by any kind of external field .",
    "probably the most well known process of this kind is double bremsstrahlung @xcite , but also photon pair creation in a magnetic field @xcite , and in a crossed field @xcite has been considered .",
    "the process under investigation in this paper is complementary to those mentioned above , and may provide for better control of the properties of the produced photons by adjusting the laser parameters .",
