    "in particular , the asymptotic state of such an _ open _ system depends both on the unitary action induced by the system hamiltonian , and the action of the environment , conventionally called ` dissipation ' . a recent idea of `` engineering by dissipation '' @xcite ,",
    "the creation of designated pure and highly entangled states of many - body quantum systems by using specially designed dissipative operators , has promoted dissipation to the same level of importance as the underlying unitary dynamics .",

( [ lind ] ) preserves the complete positivity of the evolution if all coupling rates are non - negative at any instance of time , @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "the challenge here consists in explicit numerical evaluation of the matrix form of this operator",
    ".    to use spectral methods ( complete / partial diagonalization and different kinds of iterative algorithms @xcite ) to calculate @xmath30 as eigen - element of a superoperator would mean to deal with @xmath31 scaling of computationally expensive operations .",

    "a direct propagation of eq .  ( [ lind ] ) for a time span long enough for @xmath37 to approach the attractor is not feasible for @xmath1 for two reasons : first , direct propagation requires to numerically propagate @xmath38 complex differential equations with time - dependent coefficients , and second , accuracy might become a problem for large times .",

    "systems with @xmath41 states may still be too small , for example , to explore mbl effects in open periodically - modulated systems .",
    "is it possible to go beyond this limit ? and if so how far ?",
    "we attempt to answer these questions by unraveling of the quantum master equation ( [ lind ] ) into a set of stochastic realizations , called `` quantum trajectories '' @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to transform the problem of the numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ lind],[pc ] ) into a task of statistical sampling over quantum trajectories which form vectors of the size @xmath4 .",
    "the price to pay for the reduction from @xmath31 to @xmath4 is that we now have to sample over many realizations .",

    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] , [ eq : jump ] ) this time scales as @xmath44 ; this is due to the multiplication of the quadratic scaling of a dense matrix - vector multiplication and a linear scaling of the jump frequency .",
    "the latter scaling is , however , model specific and may differ for other physical systems so that the overall computation time may vary substantially with the type of hamiltonian and/or dissipators under study . on top ,",
    "the numbers we present in table [ table1 ] depend on the values of the coupling constant @xmath45 and the period of modulations @xmath26 .",
    "this is so because these parameters control the rate of the jumps .",

    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] , [ eq : jump ] ) .",
    "we start with the performance of the algorithm , table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the idea of the algorithm mimics a float : the algorithm constantly attempts to ` float to the surface ' , i.e. , to increase the time step of integration towards its maximal value @xmath46 while every next jump pulls it downwards to @xmath47 , see fig .  [ fig : husimi ] .",
    "the average time between two consequent jumps is the mean of the local maxima in the depicted saw - like time sequence of @xmath48 .",
    "there is no problem in overestimating @xmath46 , simply because the time step will rarely reach its maximum .",
    "the shortest time step , @xmath47 , or , equivalently , the depth @xmath49 , is tuned to the values needed to reach the desired accuracy .",
    "next we turn to the averages @xmath50 over the realizations and the corresponding statistical variances @xmath51 $ ] of the matrix elements , as discussed in detail in section  [ sampling ] .",
    "both quantities converge to `` limit cycles '' if the propagation time @xmath52 , @xmath53 , is much larger than all relaxation times .",
    "this means that for @xmath54 the density matrix converges to a time - periodic quantum attractor , i.e. , @xmath55 , and the variances also become time - periodic functions , @xmath56 \\backsimeq \\operatorname{var}[\\varrho^\\mathrm{att}_{kl}(\\tau)]$ ] , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b .",
    "the crumpled caustic - like shapes of the limit cycles is a result of the projection on a plane of a global limit - cycle living in @xmath57-dimensional space .",

    "can be performed stroboscopically , i.e. , after every period @xmath26 . in our simulations we used as the transient time @xmath58 and then performed the stroboscopic sampling of @xmath59 .",
    "the attractor density matrix at any other instant of time @xmath60 can be sampled by shifting the starting time of the sampling , @xmath61 , or simply by performing an extra - sampling at all needed intermediate points .    with @xmath62 samples per trajectory ( that amounts to an additional propagation for the time @xmath63 ) it became possible to collect @xmath64 samples for the model of dimension @xmath65 ( i.e. , with @xmath66 indistinguishable bosons ) by running the program on @xmath67 cores during three days . for some choice of parameters the sample density matrix displays a standard diagonal - dominated structure , see fig .",

    "the husimi distribution of the sample density matrix is depicted in fig .",

    "there is an intriguing similarity between the distribution of the quantum attractor and the phase - space structure of the classical attractor ( its stroboscopic section , to be more precise ) produced by the mean - field equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : thetadot ] ) .",
    "this allows us to conjecture that the attractor density matrix is resolved with good accuracy .",

    "it was not possible , however , to go beyond @xmath70 when evaluating the corresponding husimi distributions . ] .",
    "the primary aim of this study was to estimate the numerical horizon of a high - accuracy sampling of non - equilibrium dissipative quantum attractors , i.e. , the asymptotic solutions of periodically driven open systems , by using the quantum trajectory method .",
    "our main result is that it is possible to resolve asymptotic density matrices of systems of several thousand of states by using even a small cluster ( with @xmath71 cores ) on a time scale of a few days .",
    "the benefit of having access to the whole density matrix is the possibility to extract more detailed information about non - equilibrium regimes encoded in the matrix structure such as purity and many - body entanglement @xcite .",
    "naturally , the next step must be a systematic analysis of the errors , statistical and numerical ones .",
    "we reserve this objective for further studies . here",
    ", we would like to surmise on further optimization of the sampling procedure .",
    "an immediate idea is to use a reduced adaptive basis , constructed by using coherent states @xcite .",
    "this however demands a priori knowledge of the attractor s structure .",
    "this insight can be obtained by using models of small sizes , @xmath72 .",
    "another possibility is the choice of more optimal initial conditions which in turn will substantially reduce the transient time @xmath73 ( for example , one can use an extrapolation of the largest - eigenvalue eigenstate of the density matrix for a small system ) .",
    "altogether , we expect that such improvements could increase @xmath4 further by a factor of @xmath74 .",
    "research areas where quantum attractors are of potential interest were already mentioned in section [ introduction ] . here",
    ", we briefly recall them .",
    "first , this is many - body localization @xcite where the action of temporal modulations @xcite and dissipation @xcite so far have been considered separately .",
    "a combined action of both factors presents an intriguing challenge .",
    "a complementary task is to extend the idea of `` dissipative engineering '' @xcite to periodically - modulated quantum systems .",
