    "the sharp feature in the curve describing the @xmath42 transition rates ( fig .",

    "the cause of this irregularity is once again traced to the near degeneracy of a single - particle state and a two - particle one - hole state .",
    "the remaining irregularities for @xmath7 in the curves presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] have similar origins .",
    "we calculate lifetimes of @xmath0 and @xmath2 levels in neutral ag and in ag - like ions with @xmath37 using third - order mbpt results for dipole matrix elements and energies . in table",
    "[ tab - life ] , we compare our lifetime data with available experimental measurements .",
    "this set of data includes results for a limited number of levels in low-@xmath8 ions ( up to @xmath58 ) .",

    "these results are listed in columns labeled @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the largest difference between the calculations in different approximations occurs for @xmath30 and @xmath28 levels for @xmath8 = 51 and 52 when @xmath65 transition energies become very small and contributions from the second and third orders become very important .",
    "it should be noted that for some levels of neutral ag and ag - like ions with @xmath8 = 48 and 49 , @xmath64 agrees better with @xmath62 than with @xmath63 .",
    "the accuracy of lifetime measurements is not very high for ag - like ions , and in some cases the lowest - order results @xmath62 , which are equivalent to the dirac - fock results of @xcite were enough to predict the lifetimes .",
    "the more sophisticated theoretical studies published recently in refs .  @xcite were restricted to @xmath66 transitions and did not include wavelength data . in two last columns of table  [ tab - life ] , we compare our theoretical wavelengths , @xmath67 with experimental measurements , @xmath68 . in the cases",
