    "the observations were taken in good photometric conditions , with typical seeing @xmath12 0.8 , and reaching a depth of _ g _ @xmath8 25.5 and _ i _ @xmath8 24.5 with s / n of 10 .",
    "the megacam data were initially reduced by cfht staff using the _ `` elixir '' _ pipeline which performs the standard bias , flatfield , and fringe corrections , and determines the photometric zero - point .",
    "the typical night - to - night variation of the zero - point is around 1 - 2% @xcite .",
    "the data are further processed by the cambridge astronomy survey unit , as described in full detail by @xcite .",
    "the near - ir data were taken in october 2008 , as part of a survey designed to look at red stellar populations in local group galaxies .",
    "it used the wide - field camera ( wfcam , @xcite ) on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",

    "the observations were done in three near - ir bands , j , h and k , with seeing of 0.8  or better , using the microstepping option to improve the pixel sampling to 0.2 .",

    "the pipeline , which is part of the vdfs , also does full astrometric and photometric calibration based on the 2mass point source catalogue and is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the nightly zero - point variation on photometric nights is @xmath18% .",
    "the reduced images were stacked and microstepped to produce individual detector frames .",
    "these were then resampled to form a 0.333 arcsec per pixel science mosaic @xcite .",
    "low resolution spectra of the new gcs were obtained during two nights in september 2010 using the isis instrument mounted on the william herschel telescope ( wht ) .",
    "several exposures were made of each object with varying integration time depending on the brightness of the target .",

    ".journal of the spectroscopic observations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ tab : cal ] shows the metallicities derived with the above relation and affirms our conclusion that the clusters are all indeed metal poor .",
    "although we do not use our spectra to derive metallicities here , we note that the similarly strong balmer lines visible in figure [ fig : samplespectra ] for pa - n147 - 1 and pa - n147 - 2 supports the similar metallicities derived from their broadband colours .",
    "there is also a hint at a radial metallicity trend with gcs with projected radii @xmath19  kpc having systematically lower [ fe / h ] values by @xmath20  dex compared to the central population . for comparison , table [",
    "tab : cal ] also shows metallicities for some of the previously - known gcs derived from spectroscopic studies @xcite , and from colour - magnitude diagram isochrone fitting @xcite . there is generally a good agreement with past studies , lending further confidence to our metallicity estimates .",
    "the only exception is fjj vii in ngc 185 for which a difference larger than 1 dex is seen between our measurements and the spectroscopic measurements of @xcite .",
    "we currently have no explanation for this .",
    "an oft - used statistic when comparing gc systems hosted by different galaxies is the gc specific frequency , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the total number of gcs in the system , and @xmath23 is the integrated absolute v magnitude of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "this quantity can be thought of as the formation efficiency of gcs relative to field stars , although the interpretation is more complicated if one considers that fractions of these populations may have been accreted rather than formed in situ . in the case of dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the globular cluster specific frequency is poorly constrained at present due to incompleteness in terms of imaging and gc detection , but it is critical for understanding what kinds of dwarf galaxies may contribute gcs to the halos of more massive systems .",
    "significant effort has been made to constrain this value for des and past surveys have focused mainly on dwarf galaxies that reside in dense environments , such as the fornax and virgo clusters @xcite .",
    "the study by @xcite found an overall trend of increasing @xmath24 with increasing @xmath25 ( decreasing galaxy luminosity ) , which has also been found in dwarf irregulars although with smaller samples @xcite .",
    "@xcite find dwarf galaxies with the highest @xmath24 values in their sample to be within 1 mpc of the virgo cluster core , which they interpret as an environmental effect .",
    "however , these authors also find that des within 40 kpc of the most massive galaxies in the virgo cluster have few or no gcs , suggesting that they have probably been stripped away by the tidal forces from the central hosts .",
    "using our updated gc census , the specific frequencies for ngc 147 and ngc 185 were recalculated and found to be 8@xmath13 2 and 5.5@xmath130.5 , respectively .",
    "this is a slight increase from the previous values which were @xmath26 for ngc 147 and @xmath27 for ngc 185 .",
    "the uncertainties quoted for ngc 147 allow for the possibility of hodge iv and sd-10 not being genuine gcs , as well as the uncertainty in the galaxy luminosity . in the case of ngc 185 ,",
    "only the uncertainty in the galaxy luminosity was taken into account .",
    "figure [ fig : sn ] shows the @xmath24 versus @xmath25 values for des observed in the fornax and virgo clusters and in the leo group , taken from the studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the error bars are due to the uncertainty in the host galaxy luminosity and the uncertainty in the total number of gcs found around each galaxy , which has been corrected for background contaminants and spatial incompleteness . on the same figure",
    "overplotted are the updated @xmath24 values for ngc 147 and ngc 185 .",
    "the @xmath24 values are within the range found for des of comparable luminosity observed by @xcite , albeit residing in different environments , and appear to follow the trend of increasing @xmath24 value with decreasing galaxy luminosity .",
    "another interesting property shared by the gc systems of ngc 147 and ngc 185 , and the gc systems of de galaxies found in rich environments , is their optical colours .",
    "the mean ( v - i)@xmath1 colours of ngc 147 and ngc 185 gcs are 0.85 and 0.84 with standard deviations of 0.09 and 0.03 respectively . in their study of des in the fornax and virgo galaxy clusters ,",
    "@xcite have reported the peak of the mean ( v - i)@xmath1 colour distribution to be 0.90 for galaxies with absolute magnitudes between -15.0 and -16.0 , and 0.85 for galaxies with absolute magnitude between -14.0 and -15.0 .",
    "this makes the gc systems of ngc 147 and ngc 185 nearly indistinguishable from those hosted by similar luminosity des in rich clusters , suggesting that the large - scale present day environment has little impact on either @xmath24 or mean optical colour .",
    "detailed surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed complex substructure in the halo of m31 , consisting of loops , streams and filaments .",
    "this inhomogeneous halo is thought to have formed over an extended period of time via the accretion and disruption of dwarf galaxies .",
    "m31 also hosts an extended population of gcs , with clusters found up to distances of 200 kpc from its centre @xcite .",
    "evidence that the outer halo gc system may have formed predominantly by accretion was hinted at by the radial number density profile ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the profile has the form of a broken power law , with characteristic flattening occurring beyond a projected radius of @xmath830 kpc .",
    "such a behaviour is found in the stellar halos of simulated galaxies that form via a combination of accretion and in situ star formation @xcite , with the break in the power law marking the point beyond which the bulk of the matter has been accreted .",
    "more compelling evidence for an accretion origin comes from the fact that gcs in the outer halo are spatially - correlated with the extended substructure of m31 @xcite .",
    "statistical tests have shown that gcs preferentially project on top of stellar streams , with the probability of this being due to chance alignment being less than 1% .",
    "on this basis , it is argued that over 80% of the gcs found beyond 30 kpc from the centre of m31 have probably been donated by captured and disrupted dwarf galaxies .",
    "the fact that there is a significant number of dwarf galaxies in the halo of m31 @xcite , where a few of the more luminous satellites are known to host gcs , shows that the halo is still actively evolving .",
    "if the majority of the m31 halo gcs were indeed donated by captured dwarf galaxies , it might be expected that they share the some properties with the gcs hosted by ngc 147 and ngc 185 .",
    "figure [ fig : gc ] displays the ( v - i)@xmath1 colours as a function of r@xmath28 from the centre of m31 for the gcs hosted by ngc 147 and ngc 185 . we also show confirmed m31 gcs that have r@xmath29 > 30 kpc taken from the revised bologna catalogue @xcite and huxor et al .",
    "2013 ( in prep ) .",
    "the m31 gcs have been de - reddened using extinction coefficients from @xcite .",
    "one can see that the gcs found around the two dwarf galaxies fit comfortably in the range of ( v - i)@xmath1 colours measured for their m31 halo counterparts .",
    "although this does not prove that the m31 halo gcs have been accreted by systems like ngc 147 and ngc 185 , it demonstrates that this idea is not inconsistent with the data . in terms of the number of gcs they currently host ,",
    "only about 8 ngc 147 or 185 systems would be needed to create almost the entire m31 halo gc population that consists of @xmath880 clusters .",
    "such accretions would also donate @xmath30  l@xmath31 of stellar light , consistent with estimates of the halo luminosity @xcite .",
    "we have presented the results of a new search for remote gcs around the m31 satellites , ngc 147 and ngc 185 , using data from pandas .",
    "the search resulted in the discovery of four new gcs , three of which are located close to ngc 147 , while one is near ngc 185 .",
    "probability arguments and newly obtained radial velocities indicate that these objects are likely to belong to the dwarfs and not the m31 halo .",
    "our findings serve as another example of the importance of studying galaxies beyond their optical boundaries .",
    "we present the first homogeneous optical and near - ir photometry for the entire gc systems of these two dwarf galaxies .",
    "we use this to constrain the gc ages and metallicities via the use of colour - colour plots and empirical colour - metallicity relations , finding that , in general , the clusters are old and metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath32 dex )",
    ".    the mean colours of the gcs hosted by ngc 147 and ngc 185 are found to lie at the peak of the colour distribution of the gc systems belonging to des in the fornax and virgo galaxy clusters , despite a large difference in the environments in which they reside .",
    "their @xmath24 values are consistent with the trend of increasing gc specific frequency with decreasing galaxy luminosity generally observed for dwarf galaxies , regardless of their type , and in a variety of environments .",
    "the close similarity between the ( v - i)@xmath1 colours of the gcs belonging to these two dwarf galaxies and those belonging to the m31 outer halo is consistent with the idea that accretion of the former could have contributed to the assembly of the latter .",
