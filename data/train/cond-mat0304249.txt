    "much of the work in the theory of the glass transition has been concentrated in the precursor phenomena present in the high temperature ( or low density ) phase on approaching the glass transition .",
    "the ( equilibrium ) dynamics in this region shows two qualitatively different regimes : a short time relaxation associated with the rattling of particles inside cages formed by their neighbors and a long time structural relaxation which , as density increases ( or @xmath0 decreases ) , takes longer and longer times  @xcite . in supercooled liquids ,",
    "the presence of a crossover temperature below which exponentially decaying correlation functions typical of the liquid phase become stretched has been observed  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this stretching of relaxations is associated to the gradual appearance of heterogeneities in the space / time domain .",
    "understanding the emergence of these heterogeneities is at the heart of the nature of the glass transition and has been the source of a lot of theoretical and experimental work  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a unifying microscopic theory is still lacking and only a few universal properties related to heterogeneities have been found .    in real space ,",
    "dynamical heterogeneities correspond to particles with different mobilities . in computer simulations of simple glass",
    "formers the presence of _ fast _ and _ slow _ particles has been observed .",
    "the typical time scales of the two types of particles can be identified for example by examining the behavior of the non - gaussian parameter associated with the van hove correlation function  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the identification of a growing time scale which seems to diverge at the mode coupling transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this characteristic time arises naturally when computing a suitable time dependent four point correlation function or _ dynamical non - linear susceptibility _  @xcite .",
    "as the temperature approaches @xmath1 from above , this dynamical response shows a growing peak at a characteristic time @xmath2 and then relaxes at long times to its equilibrium value .",
    "this growing characteristic time of the four point functions has been associated with the presence of long lived dynamical heterogeneities ( clusters of very slow or immobile particles ) . from a landscape point of view , the emergence of stretching seems to be consequence of the gradual confinement of the system in low ( free ) energy regions of phase space surrounded by growing barriers as temperature decreases .",
    "the confinement is due in part to the dramatic decrease of escape directions in configuration space on approaching the glass transition  @xcite . in simple models of binary mixtures",
    "it has been found that stretched relaxations are associated with long lived superstructures or `` metabasins '' in configuration space  @xcite .",
    "the relaxation from single metabasins shows a stretched behavior and different metabasins relax with different characteristic times , giving rise to the overall stretching observed for example in the @xmath3 region of the incoherent scattering function .    at variance with the enormous amount of work on the problem of heterogeneities in glasses ,",
    "much less is known about them in systems with quenched disorder  @xcite . differently from true glasses , where the inhomogeneities are dynamically created by the self induced local frustration and persist during a given timescale ,",
    "the quenched disorder induces structural heterogeneities that may have infinite lifetime . in this sense",
    "they can be called",
    "_ quenched heterogeneities_. since the inhomogeneities are pinned by the disorder , they may be easier to detect and characterize than in systems with self induced disorder .",
    "thus , the posed question is to what extent these heterogeneities influence the relaxation properties and how different regions of the sample differ from each other .",
    "moreover , how do they affect the different degrees of freedom present in the system ( like particles and spins ) ?    to answer these questions ,",
    "in this work we address the problem of heterogeneities in systems with quenched disorder by focusing the analysis on the behavior of a two dimensional version of the frustrated ising lattice gas ( filg ) which has been proposed as a simple lattice glass model  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is known that the presence of quenched disorder in the definition of the model introduces some features not typical of real glasses . in",
    "particular it acts as a pinning field for heterogeneities , some of which can have infinite lifetime .",
    "this is reflected in the behavior of dynamical correlation functions and in the non - linear susceptibility and compressibility as will be shown below .",
    "in this context we will consider a measure of local frustration  @xcite , show how it induces the appearance of spatial heterogeneities and how this reflects in the observed behavior of equilibrium density distributions and dynamic correlation functions .",
    "for the sake of comparison with other glassy systems without quenched disorder we also discuss the behavior of the non - linear susceptibility associated with the spin degrees of freedom and of the non - linear compressibility of the density variables .",
    "finally , an analysis of the universal behavior in terms of hole variables recently introduced  @xcite shows that this system seems to be in a different universality class than the previously investigated glass models without disorder .",
    "the frustrated ising lattice gas  @xcite is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath4 at each site of the lattice there are two different dynamical variables : local density ( occupation ) variables @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and internal degrees of freedom , @xmath7 . the usually complex spatial structure of the molecules of glass forming liquids , which can assume several spatial orientations , is in part responsible for the geometric constraints on their mobility .",
    "here we consider the simplest case of two possible orientations , and the steric effects imposed on a particle by its neighbors are felt as restrictions on its orientation due to the quenched variables @xmath8 connecting nearest neighbors sites .",
    "the first term of the hamiltonian ensures that when @xmath9 is large , any two neighboring particles will have their spins satisfying the connection between them .",
    "finally @xmath10 represents a chemical potential ruling the system density ( at fixed volume ) .",
    "this model has been studied mainly through simulations  @xcite in @xmath11 and analytically in mean field  @xcite . in the low density ( high temperature )",
    "phase , the system behavior is liquid like , the dynamics is fast , time - translationally invariant and obeys the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . by increasing the density ( or lowering the temperature ) , the system has a spin glass transition characterized by a divergence of the static nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "this transition point is located quite close to the point where the system suffers a dynamical arrest , where the particles are no longer able to diffuse . after a sub - critical quench ,",
    "the dynamics is slow and history dependent . besides that , it presents aging and violates the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( we refer the interested reader to @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "since bonds are created at random ( with probability @xmath12 of being @xmath13 ) , the system is not homogeneous at the lenghtscale of the lattice spacing .",
    "each site belongs to several minimal plaquets and there is a probability that all ( or neither ) of these are frustrated .",
    "this would influence the dynamics at a local level since the system is no longer invariant under spatial translations .",
    "thus we may ask which are the consequences of these quenched heterogeneities on the equilibrium properties of the system .    when evaluating the partition function at finite density , the configurations in which particles close any frustrated loop will have zero probability .",
    "the average density will no longer be site independent and the density distribution @xmath14 will be inhomogeneous , i.e. will show spatial fluctuations .",
    "homogeneity will only be recovered when @xmath15 . for small densities ,",
    "the distribution will be gaussian while deviations from gaussianity should be evident as the density increases .",
    "the forbidden configurations introduce spatial inhomogeneities that are long lived as they derive from the quenched _",
    "random _ underlying connections . in other lattice models , as well as in structural glasses ,",
    "the disorder is not quenched , what restores translational invariance if the measure time is much larger than the dynamical heterogeneities characteristic time .",
    "an example of a system with quenched but not random frustration , that does not present these inhomogeneities is the fully frustrated version of the filg .    to quantify this we use the ( local ) coarse - grained quantity @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the minimal plaquets containing the site @xmath18 .",
    "that is , for every site , we consider the 4 minimal plaquets that contain that site ( 12 in @xmath19 ) and we check how many of these plaquets are frustrated , i.e. the product of the connections in the loop is negative .",
    "this local frustration parameter was originally considered in the context of dynamical heterogeneities in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this nearest neighbor",
    "plaquet approximation sites that are maximally frustrated have all of its 4 plaquets with negative products and sites with no frustration have all plaquets with positive products .",

    "one can also note that the distributions are asymmetric around @xmath42 : for example , in the case of @xmath43 and @xmath44 the former is broader and shorter while the latter is higher and more concentrated .",
    "a possible explanation is that sites with negative values of @xmath20 are more influenced by higher order plaquets than sites with positive @xmath20 , thus having a broader distribution .    in @xmath19",

    "indeed , we measure the density of holes accordingly to the @xmath20 of the hole site . for small values of @xmath59",
    "there is no difference between these values and all curves collapse .",
    "the fact that for higher densities these curves fall apart is an indication that the holes also have preferred sites and tend to form small clusters .",
    "thus , near @xmath47 , the mechanism leading to diffusion is no longer the pairwise collisions between holes but a more complicated process involving these small clusters , what may lead to a failure of the @xmath48-square law  .",
    "further work along this line has to be done in order to clarify this issue .",
    "in ref.@xcite the nonequilibrium behavior of the model was shown to present interesting aging properties similar to those observed in glass forming systems . here",
    "we address equilibrium density correlations instead and the role of heterogeneities in the low density phase .",

    "the densities are also averaged over the thermal history in each sample .",

    "[ fig.cn ] . nevertheless two regimes can be clearly observed and all the curves can be fitted by stretched exponentials ( not shown ) in the first regime .",
    "the second regime at longer times observed for the largest densities can also be fitted by stretched exponentials with other parameters and probably will tend to develop a plateau at higher densities .     for several values of @xmath10 for a dynamics with spin flip , particle creation - destruction and diffusion.,width=226 ]    for the same values of the chemical potential or mean density shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.cn ] , the diluted spin correlations show a different behavior .",
    "the correlations between spins on occupied sites are defined as @xmath64 the results for several values of @xmath10 are shown in fig .",

    "interestingly , the correlations @xmath65 and @xmath66 decay with very different timescales : density correlations decay much faster than the diluted spin correlations .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "particles can be created / destroyed and diffuse through the lattice , forming clusters of neighboring particles .",
    "once they belong to the same cluster , the nature of the interaction enforces them to have spins satisfying all the bonds in the cluster , otherwise they should move apart .",
    "thus , when a site contributes for the correlation at different times , the contribution will be positive , unless there is enough time for the whole cluster to flip all its spins .",
    "moreover , the percolation transition is just below @xmath34 and the considered clusters are large , making the decorrelation time quite large .     for several values of @xmath10 for a dynamics with spin flip , particle creation - destruction and diffusion .",
    "the symbols are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig.cn].,width=226 ]    the diluted spin correlations start to develop an incipient plateau as the value of the chemical potential increases .",

    "[ fig.taus ] we show an arrhenius plot of the relaxation times showing that they tend to diverge for @xmath67 .",
    "this is different from the behavior observed in the three dimensional model  @xcite , which shows a power law divergence at a finite value of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , while the three dimensional model presents a spin glass transition at a finite chemical potential the two dimensional model only has a transition at @xmath67 .",
    "both correlations can also be measured only for sites presenting a given value of the frustration parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the curves for the 5 possible values ( in @xmath45 ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.cn_mu03 ] and [ fig.cns_mu03 ] for @xmath34 .",
    "fits to stretched exponential decay are also shown for the diluted spin correlations .",
    "they are normalized to unity but , recalling fig .",
    "[ fig.prhosep ] , the number of sites contributing to each one of the curves is different .",
    "the behavior for @xmath68 is very different and almost all curves give the same correlation , only sites with @xmath24 differ slightly from the others ( and their contribution to the overall curve is small ) . on the other hand , for @xmath69 the curves",
    "are strongly resolved and we notice that the dynamics is faster in those sites in highly frustrated regions",
    ". this may be due to the fact that since particle creation - destruction is allowed , particles appearing in these regions have a higher probability to go elsewhere or be destroyed ( as these are regions of less than average densities ) , what makes the decorrelation time small . on the other hand , low frustration regions are those preferred by the particles and correlations take much more time to decay ( as these are regions of larger than average densities ) .",
    "the total correlation ( not shown ) follows closely the @xmath42 or mean frustration curve .",
    "note that all local correlations show stretched exponential relaxations irrespective of the value of the local frustration being high or low . in this scenario",
    "the stretched relaxation does not emerge as a consequence of some kind of convolution of local exponential relaxations with different time scales . at this level of description ,",
    "the stretching , although heterogeneous due to different local frustration , is intrinsic .",
    "as the density increases this scenario does not change qualitatively .",

    "the symbols are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig.cn_mu03 ] .",
    "notice that low frustration sites already show a small plateau , although in the full correlation ( fig .",
    "[ fig.cns ] ) , this is not yet noticeable.,width=226 ]    it is interesting to remark that for high values of @xmath10 the decay of the diluted spin correlation starts to develop a plateau and the sites responsible for this behavior are those that are less frustrated .",
    "the effect is not much pronounced because the summed up effect of @xmath70 and 0 sites is dominant .    as the dynamical heterogeneities have attracted much attention recently ,",
    "several quantities have been devised to quantify them  @xcite . among them , of particular interest is the four point correlation ( or dynamical nonlinear response ) defined as @xmath71 away from the transition , this function presents a maximum at a time @xmath2 that is a measure of the timescale during which the particles forming the heterogeneity are correlated .",
    "the long time behavior of this quantity is a measure of its equilibrium value . in figure  [ fig.het ]",
    "we plot @xmath72 .",
    "analogously to what happens in other glass models it presents a broad peak that shifts to longer times and gets higher as the density increases .",
    "nevertheless an important difference from other models is that after the peak the non - linear compressibility does not decay too much and develops a density - dependent plateau at long times .",
    "the persistence of density correlations is a clear signature of the presence of very long lived heterogeneities , a consequence of the pinning effect of the quenched disorder present in the model .",
    "the possible divergence of the equilibrium ( infinite time ) limit of the non - linear compressibility should point to the existence of a thermodynamic transition associated with the density degrees of freedom not yet observed in this model .     as a function of time for different chemical potentials . for increasing chemical potential ( hence densities ) the peak increases and shifts to longer times.,width=226 ]    analogously , for diluted spin correlations we can evaluate eq .  [ eq.x4 ] using @xmath69 in the place of @xmath68 .",
    "the resultant @xmath73 is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.hetns ] .",
    "the behavior is similar to that observed for the density variables , but instead of a peak we observe a crossover time after which this non - linear susceptibility saturates in a finite density dependent value . in this case",
    "the height of the plateau seems to diverge much more rapidly than for the compressibility giving more plausibility to the presence of a thermodynamic transition in the spin variables , probably for @xmath67 .",
    "the crossover to a plateau , instead of the presence of a peak , clearly points to the appearance of a persistent correlation length associated with the spin degrees of freedom . it would be interesting to check if these persistence is a manifestation of a growing structural correlation length which might diverge at an equilibrium spin glass transition similar to that present in d=3 .     as a function of time for different chemical potentials .",
    "note here the saturation after a crossover time and the stronger growth of the subsequent plateau at variance with the behavior of @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig.het].,width=226 ]",
    "in this paper we considered the role played by heterogeneities present in a model with quenched disorder . differently from self - induced frustration models here the heterogeneities may be pinned by the local frustration and this allows a simple characterization of them .",
    "the effects of these pinned heterogeneities on time correlation functions and distribution of local densities have been analyzed .",
    "the system forms clumps in the liquid phase even when the particles either do not interact or strongly repel each other  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these clumps are long - lived and it would be interesting to study their size distribution and how they are correlated  @xcite .",
    "a simple measure of local frustration  @xcite was considered and a strong correlation with the inhomogeneous density distribution was found . the use of @xmath20 allowed to decompose the local density distributions in components related to the degree of local frustration . however , the use of @xmath20 as a measure of the local frustration considering only the minimal plaquets has to be considered as a first order approximation .",
    "indeed , higher order plaquets , involving larger loops , have to be taken into account in order to obtain the full dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath20 .",
    "for example , in the @xmath45 case , there exists 12 plaquets of second order ( those having 6 bonds ) .",
    "it is an open problem to determine to what extent the present results may change by considering the effects of larger loops in @xmath20 and how they determine the average local density and affect the relaxation properties .",
    "it was shown also that dynamic correlations can be decomposed accordingly to the local values of frustration and in each case the relaxations are essentially stretched although the degree of stretching is of course dependent on the degree of local frustration .",
    "it would be interesting to study the possible relation between _ local _ correlation functions in the out - of - equilibrium regime and the violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite with the local frustration as defined by the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "further insight into the relation of the filg with other models of glasses and spin glasses can be gained by analyzing non - linear responses .",
    "we showed that two such responses associated with different degrees of freedom in the model behave differently in some important aspects . at variance with models of glasses",
    ", the spin non - linear susceptibility shows a crossover time after which the response saturates instead of the characteristic peak observed for example in models with constrained dynamics .",
    "also the rapid growth of the plateau at long times suggests the developing of a structural correlation length associated with a possible spin glass transition .",
    "this remains to be confirmed .",
    "the non - linear compressibility instead shows a broad peak but with a modest further relaxation to a density dependent plateau . in this case",
    "one can associate this plateau with the formation of very long lived _ quenched heterogeneities_. from the observed behavior of these non - linear responses one can conclude that the filg does not behave neither as a proper spin glass nor as a glass sharing some characteristics with both kinds of systems .",
    "although the model considered here has been originally introduced as an attempt to obtain a finite dimensional lattice system with glassy properties similar to structural glasses the main drawback is the lack of invariance under spatial translations already in the liquid phase .",
    "there are several ways to restore this invariance .",
    "for example , by considering spatially coarse - grained variables or by including a temporal evolution of the bonds  @xcite .",
    "as it stands this model still may be interesting to study transport in disordered media ( see  @xcite and references therein ) which has been of much interest recently ."
