    "entanglement is known today as a key feature and resource of quantum mechanics .",
    "it has been found important not only for studying the nonlocal and nonclassical behavior of quantum particles but also for a wide range of applications in quantum engineering and quantum information theory @xcite , such as super - dense coding @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , or the quantum search algorithm @xcite .",
    "apart from the bell states as prototypes of two - partite entangled states , various attempts have been made recently in order to produce and control entanglement also for more complex systems .",
    "owing to the fragile nature of most of these states , however , the manipulation of larger quantum systems still remains a great challenge for experiment and only a few proof - of - principle implementations have been realized so far that generate entangled states with more than two parties in a well - controlled manner .",
    "recently , briegel and raussendorf @xcite have introduced a novel type of multi - partite entangled states .",
    "these ( so - called ) _ cluster _",
    "states are known to exhibit a rather high persistency and robustness of their entanglement with regard to decoherence effects @xcite .",
    "apart from the fundamental interest in these states @xcite and their use in quantum communication protocols @xcite , the cluster states also form the key ingredient for one - way quantum computations @xcite . in general",
    ", a cluster state can be constructed from an array of uncorrelated qubits by carrying out the following two steps : ( i ) the preparation of each qubit in the superposition @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 refer to the distinguishable basis states of some given two - level system , such as the spin projection of a spin-1/2 particle or the polarization of light , and ( ii ) the ( subsequent ) application of the controlled - z operation @xcite @xmath8 between  some or all  pairs of neighboring qubits in order to entangle them with each other .",
    "since the original paper by briegel and raussendorf , the generation of cluster states has attracted much attention and has become a research topic by itself . using a linear - optical set - up , for example ,",
    "a proof - of - principle implementation of a four - qubit cluster state has first been reported by walther and coworkers @xcite , and was utilized also by tokunaga @xcite in order to demonstrate basic operations for the one - way quantum computing . in the framework of cavity qed , in which neutral atoms are coupled to a high - finesse microwave or optical cavity ,",
    "different schemes have been suggested during recent years to generate linear cluster states @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the linear cluster states , the two - dimensional cluster states would enable one to perform also multi - qubit gate operations ( e.g.  quantum gates that act on two or more qubits simultaneously ) in one - way computations @xcite and , therefore , may result in a viable alternative to the conventional ( circuit ) computations in which sequences of unitary gates need to be carried out .",
    "up to the present , nevertheless , only a minor progress has been achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite with regard to schemes that generate two - dimensional cluster states within cavity qed . in this reference ,",
    "the two - dimensional cluster state is obtained by combining two ( or more ) linear cluster states , which however , requires demanding experimental set - up and imposes certain restrictions on the geometry of the output cluster state .    in this paper , we suggest two practical schemes for the generation of two - dimensional @xmath2 and @xmath1 cluster states that are feasible for modern cavity qed experiments .",
    "these schemes work in a completely deterministic way and are based on the resonant interaction of a chain of rydberg atoms with ( high - finesse ) bimodal cavities which , in contrast to a single - mode cavity , support two independent modes of the light field . while only one of these cavities is required for the generation of the @xmath2 cluster states , two ( and more ) cavities are needed to construct cluster states of larger size .",
    "below , we describe the individual steps in the interaction of the rydberg atoms with the cavity modes that are required to perform the suggested scheme . here , we shall introduce also a graphical language in order to display all these steps in terms of quantum circuits and temporal sequences of the interactions that each of atoms undergoes .",
    "after all the atom - cavity interactions have been completed , the cluster state is encoded in the chain of atoms that has passed through one ( in the first scheme for the @xmath0 cluster ) or through two subsequent cavities ( in the second scheme for the @xmath1 cluster ) .",
    "in addition , we also show how the suggested procedure can be extended to construct two - dimensional cluster states of arbitrary size , once a sufficiently large chain of atoms and an array of cavities are provided .",
    "we briefly discuss the implementation of one - way quantum computations within the given set - up in order to demonstrate that our approach is well suited for present - day experiments using bimodal microwave cavities .",
    "in addition , we briefly point to and discuss the main limitations that may arise experimentally in the generation of larger cluster states by using microwave cavities similar to those as utilized in the laboratoire kastler brossel ( ens ) in paris .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we start with a brief reminder on the ( resonant ) interaction of one two - level rydberg atom with a bimodal cavity . in section ii.a",
    ", we then recall the steps that are necessary in order to generate the linear @xmath9 cluster state , and which sets the stage also to discuss the generation of two - dimensional cluster states . in section ii.b ,",
    "we present the scheme for the @xmath2 cluster state and , in section ii.c , for the @xmath1 state as well as for two - dimensional clusters of larger size .",
    "finally , a summary and outlook are given in section iv .     and then passes through a ramsey zone @xmath10 , a cavity @xmath11 , the ramsey zones @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and until the atoms are ionized and observed finally at the detector @xmath14 .",

    "apart from the matching of the atomic frequency ( upper half ) , the lower part of this figure displays the time dependence of the atom - cavity detuning @xmath22 , implying a step - wise change from the resonant @xmath23 interaction regime @xmath24 to the resonant @xmath25 regime @xmath26",

    "the resonant atom - cavity interaction is perhaps the simplest regime that can be used to entangle the circular excited states of a rydberg atom , in a well - controlled way , with the quantized field states of a cavity . for a sufficiently high quality ( factor ) of the cavity mirrors ,",
    "this regime implies a strong atom - field coupling for which the dissipation of energy from the cavity becomes negligible during the interaction period .",
    "indeed , a negligible dissipation is crucial for the engineering of multipartite entangled states between atomic qubits , if the cavity mediates this entanglement formation .",
    "apart from the quality of the cavity , the correct matching of the atomic transition frequency to the resonant frequency of the cavity mode(s ) , the so - called detuning , is also important in order to realize a resonant interaction between the atom and the cavity .    in the following ,",
    "let us adopt here the language of the haroche group @xcite for describing the cavity qed experiments and to specify the states of the atoms and the cavity . in the experiments of haroche and coworkers ,",
    "rubidium atoms are prepared to occupy one of the three rydberg levels with principal quantum numbers 51 , 50 , or 49 , and which are referred to as excited state @xmath27 , ground state @xmath28 , and auxiliary state @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "owing to the particular design of the microwave cavity , however , only the states @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be involved in the atom - cavity interaction because only the @xmath18 transition frequency of an rubidium atom can be tuned to the frequency of the cavity mode(s ) . the classical microwave field from the sources @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 [ cf .",

    "note that neither the state @xmath48 nor @xmath49 appears in the time evolution ( [ e1 ] ) in line with our physical intuition that the photon energy is stored either by the atom or the cavity but should not occur twice in the system .",
    "in contrast to a single - mode cavity , bimodal cavities support two non - degenerate modes of light with ( usually ) orthogonal polarization .",
    "since the frequencies of these cavity modes are fixed by the design and geometry of the cavity mirrors , the atomic frequency @xmath30 need to be ( de-)tuned in the course of the interaction such that the atom can interact resonantly with either the first or the second cavity mode . in the language of quantum information ,",
    "the additional cavity mode gives rise to another photonic qubit that may interact independently with the atomic qubits , while they are passing through the cavity .",
    "from the first experiments with bimodal cavities @xcite , their use has been found an important step towards the generation and control of entangled states . indeed , a number of proposals @xcite has been made in the literature in order to exploit further capabilities of bimodal cavities concerning , for example , the coherent manipulation of complex quantum states or for performing fundamental tests on quantum theory .",
    "below , we shall denote the two cavity modes by @xmath50 and @xmath51 and assume that they are associated with the frequencies @xmath20 and @xmath21 , such that @xmath52 .",
    "for the cavity utilized in the experiments by rauschenbeutel and coworkers @xcite , in particular , a frequency splitting of @xmath53 khz was realized .",
    "owing to this fixed splitting in the frequency of the field modes , we refer to the detuning of the atomic transition frequency with regard to the first cavity mode frequency : @xmath54 , briefly as the atom - cavity detuning .",
    "an entanglement of a rydberg atom with the photon field of the cavity is then achieved in a controlled way by tuning the @xmath18 transition frequency as function of time , so that it is in resonance with either one or the other cavity mode , while the atom passes through the cavity . for a sufficiently fast switch of the detuning @xmath55 ,",
    "i.e.  of the atomic frequency between the two modes of the cavity , a resonant interaction ( regime ) is realized with either mode @xmath50 for @xmath56 _ or _ with the mode @xmath51 for @xmath57 , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig:1](b ) , and where usually a step - wise change from the @xmath58 to the @xmath59 interaction is assumed . in the experiments by haroche and coworkers ,",
    "the detuning is changed by applying a well adjusted time - varying electric field across the gap between the cavity mirrors , so that the required ( stark ) shift of the atomic @xmath30 transition frequency is obtained . instead of the instantaneous ( step - like ) change of the atom - cavity detuning , however , only a ",
    "more or less  smooth switch can be realized for the detuning of the atomic frequency within the finite time of @xmath60 . in practice ,",
    "such a finite switch is not completely negligible and may affect the evolution of the cavity states @xcite .",
    "in the present work , however , we shall not consider the effects of this finite switching time but assume a step - wise change in the detuning as indicated in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .",

    "[ fig:7](e ) .",
    "neither of these two steps do require any additional atom - cavity gates that has not been described and discussed in the previous subsections .",
    "therefore , this procedure enables us to construct the @xmath3 cluster states in a way which is well adapted to our set - up with two bimodal cavities . because the first step can be realized by applying the circuit from fig .",
    "[ fig:4](d ) , we need to display and discuss here only the circuit for the second step .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , where the gates inside of the dashed box must be repeated @xmath166 times .",
    "similar as above , this circuit can be translated in a straightforward way into a temporal sequence of the atom - cavity interactions and single atomic gates .    by having understood the construction of the @xmath1 cluster states , we can use the recipe from fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] to generate the two - dimensional regular cluster states of arbitrary size .",
    "similarly as the @xmath1 cluster state is obtained from the @xmath2 cluster and @xmath78 disconnected qubits , one can insert more cavities into the experimental set - up in order to generate @xmath4 cluster state ( by means of @xmath167 cavities in total ) , and with a proper assignment of the atomic labels to the nodes of the cluster state .",
    "of course , there may arise the question of how many atoms from one atomic chain can be incorporated in a cluster state , in line with the recent developments in cavity qed ? to obtain some rough estimate , let us consider a scenario in which each atomic qubit can be built into the cluster state for the price of a @xmath168 rabi rotation . if we assume that the ( minimum ) distance between any two subsequent atoms in the chain is equal to the double waist length of the cavity mode , then , the number of atoms is approximately related to the lifetime @xmath169 of the atom - cavity system via relation @xmath170 where @xmath171 denotes the required time for a single @xmath96 rabi rotation and @xmath172 is a factor which accounts for all corrections to our idealized scheme .",
    "such corrections may concern the imperfect realization of the rabi and ramsey pulses , the overlapping interaction of two atoms from the chain with the same cavity mode , the effects of noisy channels and stray fields , and others . in practise , such additional disturbances may lead to a much smaller number @xmath78 of atoms that can be treated coherently . for the atomic velocity @xmath173 , that was utilized in the microwave cavity experiments by haroche and coworkers",
    ", a single @xmath96 rabi rotation takes about @xmath174 .",
    "moreover , the lifetime of the atom - cavity system is limited mainly by the radiative lifetime of the atoms @xmath175 ( while the cavity coherence time @xmath176 is much longer ) .",
    "therefore , by making a conservative estimate for the correction factor in eq .",

    "( c ) , i.e.  which transforms the @xmath116 cluster state and the @xmath78 uncorrelated qubits into the cluster state @xmath179 .",
    "the @xmath116 state is given by qubits labeled as @xmath180 and the @xmath78 uncorrelated qubits are labeled as @xmath181 , respectively ( see text for details).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ] +      obviously , the realization of large ( entangled ) cluster states with a trustworthy fidelity is an experimental challenge by itself . in the earlier cavity - qed experiments by rauschenbeutel and coworkers @xcite ,",
    "the generation of a three - partite greenberger - horne - zeilinger state ( that is equivalent to the @xmath182 linear cluster state ) was reported with a fidelity of @xmath183 % , that is just above the threshold which is necessary to prove the generation of this state . in this subsection",
    ", we shall therefore discuss the main limitations that may arise experimentally in the generation of larger cluster states by using microwave cavities similar to those as applied in the laboratoire kastler brossel ( ens ) in paris .",
    "one of the main bottleneck in cavity - qed experiments is the low surface quality of the cavity mirrors , i.e.  the local roughness and the deviations from the spherical geometry .",
    "these defects cause the scattering of photons outside the cavity mode and thus reduce the coherent storage time of photons within the cavity .",
    "the storage time of photons , in turn , limits the number of quantum operations ( gates ) that can be performed successively before the atom - cavity state becomes destroyed .",
    "this rapid loss of coherence during the evolution of the atom - cavity state has stimulated haroche and coworkers to develop a new ultrahigh - finesse cavity devices @xcite for which the quality factor was increased by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "such a high quality factor enables to perform more than hundred quantum logical operations within the lifetime of a photon inside the cavity ( see estimations in the previous subsection ) .",
    "moreover , in order to minimize the contribution of thermal photons that occur in microwave cavities due to thermal fields , the cavity was cooled down to @xmath184 k which yields an average number of @xmath185 thermal photons .",
    "this ensures that the contributions of thermal photons can be neglected for the evolution of the cavity states .    in practice ,",
    "the atoms that are emitted from the atomic source have a spread in their velocities . for a given chain of atoms",
    ", such a spread will lead to small deviations in the time intervals of the atom - cavity interactions and will introduce uncertainties in the duration of rabi and ramsey pulses . in order to minimize this velocity spread , a velocity selector has been placed right after the atomic source @xmath83 in experiments by haroche and co - workers .",
    "this selector reduces the velocity spread to @xmath186 m / s @xcite which being compared to the typical velocity of @xmath187 m / s of the atoms , implies that the error due to the velocity spread is less than one percent and negligible for most purposes . the small spread in the velocities",
    "gives rise also to a small spatial dispersion ( @xmath188 mm ) of the atomic positions while they pass through the cavity .",
    "this spatial dispersion compared to the resonant cavity wavelength ( @xmath189 mm ) implies that only a small deflection from the cavity antinode may occur and may yield a similar small deviation of the atom - cavity coupling from its nominal value .",
    "indeed , the control and manipulation of the resonant cavity frequency is essential in order to achieve a resonant atom - cavity interaction regime .",
    "any deviation from this resonant regime would lead to spurious matrix elements in the atom - cavity gates ( [ m - swap ] ) and ( [ i - swap ] ) . in the experiments by haroche and co - workers ,",
    "the cavity frequency is manipulated by slightly changing the distance between the cavity mirrors . by making use of a piezoelectric stack placed under the lower cavity mirror ,",
    "a fine tuning of the cavity length was achieved with @xmath190 mhz range , which has to be compared to the atomic transition frequency @xmath191 ghz .",
    "again , such small deviations in the length seems to be negligible . in the present work , however , we consider a bimodal cavity scenario in which the atomic transition frequency is tuned to the first or second cavity mode by applying a time - varying electric field across the cavity gap , such that the required ( stark ) shift of the atomic @xmath30 transition frequency is obtained .",
    "as explained in the beginning of this section , a rather smooth switch of the atom - cavity detuning is produced within the finite time of @xmath192 that could affect the evolution of the cavity states @xcite whenever the switching pulse is comparable to the rabi pulse .    finally , in order to describe the real evolution of the atom - cavity system , one would have to include also the interaction with the environment that has been omitted from the present considerations . as pointed out in the beginning of this section",
    ", the resonant atom - cavity interaction regime implies a negligible dissipation of the cavity field during all the atom - cavity interaction time periods . by setting sufficient distance between the atoms in a chain , events with several atoms in the same cavity mode",
    "are avoided .",
    "however , such a distance may yield the cavity to be empty and thus field dissipation would have to be taken into account .",
    "a detailed investigation of the evolution of bimodal cavity states with dissipation has been performed by magalhaes and nemes @xcite and the dynamics of the cavity - field relaxation has been understood . on the other hand , a quantum simulator has been developed in our group @xcite which could be utilized in future studies to investigate the role of decoherence on the evolution of cluster states .",
    "overall , we conclude that further improvement of the cavity mirrors quality factor and the time - varying electric field characteristics are needed in order to produce large cluster states by the suggested schemes with a good fidelity .",
    "in this work , two novel schemes are presented to generate the two - dimensional @xmath2 and @xmath1 cluster states within the framework of cavity qed .",
    "these schemes are based on the resonant interaction of a chain of rydberg atoms with one or two bimodal cavities , i.e.  cavities that support two independent modes ( with orthogonal polarization ) of the photon field . in addition , we have shown and discussed how the scheme for the @xmath1 cluster state can be extended also for the construction of two - dimensional @xmath4 cluster states of arbitrary size .",
    "this is achieved by using @xmath167 bimodal cavities in a row . using the graphical language of temporal sequences and quantum circuits , a comprehensive description of all necessary gates and manipulations",
    "is provided .",
    "we stress that the given scheme(s ) can easily be adapted to the present - day microwave cavity qed experiments although their realization is still a challenge , especially if one is interested in cluster states with @xmath193 .",
    "the results of this paper also suggest that cavity qed provides a suitable framework not only for the generation of cluster states but also for one - way quantum computations which are performed by a sequence of single - qubit projective measurements ( with possible feedforwarding ) . for these computations , a cluster state of appropriate size",
    "is needed together with two types of measurements @xcite : ( i ) measurement in the basis @xmath194 and ( ii ) measurement in the basis @xmath195 where @xmath109 denotes a real number .",
    "those qubits which are not projected ( measured ) finally , encode the output quantum state .    to see how the one - way quantum computations fit into the framework of cavity qed , we can reconsider the set - up displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) . in this figure ,",
    "a particular cluster state is generated within a chain of atoms emitted by the atomic source @xmath83 after it crosses the cavity and microwave sources .",
    "this cluster state , being encoded in the atomic chain , then enters into the detection region , where each ( rydberg ) atom is projected upon one of its levels @xmath196 , @xmath197 , or @xmath198 and by which , therefore , the measurement in the basis ( i ) is performed .",
    "in order to perform also the measurement in the basis ( ii ) , a ramsey zone @xmath13 is installed and applied before the detector .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that a @xmath105 ramsey pulse detuned by the value of @xmath109 from atomic resonance followed by a detection of the atom in the basis ( i ) , is equivalent to a projective measurement in the basis ( [ basis ] ) .",
    "the last ( unmeasured ) atoms inside the atomic chain , encode the final output quantum state .",
    "we may conclude , therefore , that all necessary ingredients are available in order to perform one - way quantum computations in the framework of cavity qed , including also the preparation of the cluster state in the same set - up ."
