    "lvy approximation is still an active area of research in several theoretical and applied directions .",
    "since lvy processes are now standard , lvy approximation is quite useful for analyzing complex systems ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover they are involved in many applications , e.g. , risk theory , finance , queueing , physics , etc . for a background on lvy process",
    "see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in particular in @xcite it has been studied the following impulsive process as partial sums in a series scheme @xmath0 the random variables @xmath1 are supposed to be independent and perturbed by the jump markov process @xmath2 .",
    "we propose to study generalization of the problem ( [ 1adf1 ] ) : @xmath3 here the random variables @xmath4 depend on the process @xmath5 .",
    "we propose to study convergence of ( [ 1bdf1 ] ) using a combination of two methods .",
    "the method proposed by r. liptser in @xcite , based on semimartingales theory , is combined with a solution of singular perturbation problem instead of ergodic theorem .",
    "so , the method includes two steps .    in the first step",
    "we prove the relative compactness of the semimartingales representation of the family @xmath6 , @xmath7 , by proving the following two facts as proposed in liptser @xcite : @xmath8 known as the compact containment condition , and @xmath9 by using singular perturbation technique as presented in @xcite .",
    "finally , we apply theorem 6.3 from @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the time - scaled impulsive process ( [ 1bdf1 ] ) and the switching markov process . in the same section we present the main results of lvy approximation . in section 3",
    "we present the proof of the theorem .",
    "let us consider the space @xmath10 endowed with a norm @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 , a _ standard phase space _ , ( i.e. , @xmath14 is a polish space and @xmath15 its borel @xmath16-algebra ) . for a vector @xmath17 and a matrix @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote their transpose respectively .",
