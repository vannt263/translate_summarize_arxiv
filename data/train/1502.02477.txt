    "we consider two sources of photons 1 , 2 and two detectors @xmath5 .",
    "( see figure 1 . )",
    "we denote the propagator from 1 to @xmath0 by @xmath6 , and similarly for the other source - detector combinations .",
    "neglecting also , for simplicity , the possible difference in arrival times , we find that the probability for simultaneous firing of both detectors due to emissions from the two sources involves @xmath7 the first two terms in this expression are the contributions from the red and blue _ processes _ in figure 1 , while the third term represents interference between them .",
    "this interference term has the remarkable property that random phases associated with the emitters 1 or 2 cancel , since each appears in both a propagator and a conjugate propagator .",
    "the interference term therefore depends only on the relative phase factor introduced by the geometry of the situation .",
    "as one varies the distance between the detectors , one gets positive or negative interference .",
    "the distance between maxima reflects the separation of the sources . for a single extended source , such as a star",
    ", the contrast will wash out at large detector separations .",
    "the rate with which that happens reflects the angular size of the source , and can be used to measure it .",
    "hanbury brown and twiss exploited this effect to measure the radius of sirius and of several other stars .",
    "subsequently , their basic idea has been applied in many other applications , ranging from heavy ion collisions to the study of condensed matter .",
    "@xmath8 +    [ hbtgeometry ]   + figure 1 : geometry of the hanbury brown - twiss intensity interferometer .",
    "two distinct processes contribute to correlated firing of the detectors .",
    "it was implicit , in our preceding discussion , that the detector could not reveal where its photon came from .",
    "if the photons have orthogonal polarizations , for example , they will not interfere . for unpolarized sources ,",
    "this effectively halves the hbt effect .",
    "the question naturally arises : if the emitters do have non - trivial polarization properties , can we access them ?",
    "for example : if we have two very nearby sources , that emit in orthogonal polarizations , can we resolve them ?",
    "unadorned hbt will not serve here , but ( as we shall see ) a simple refinement accesses much more information , and does the job .",
    "let us first consider the simple case where emitter 1 produces photons with polarization described , in a basis of orthogonal linear polarizations , by @xmath9 , while emitter 2 produces photons with polarization @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , let us apply projections @xmath11 at the two detectors .",
    "then the rate for simultaneous firing becomes , as in our earlier discussion , a sum of the separate process terms @xmath12 and the interference term @xmath13    we can generalize this by allowing the sources to emit in mixtures , described by polarization ( density ) matrices @xmath14 . then we get for the uncrossed terms @xmath15 and for the crossed term @xmath16 where in the second line we exploit the hermiticity of @xmath17 .    by letting the @xmath18s interpolate between the two orthogonal polarizations of the sources in our model problem , we obtain interference between them , which could allow us to resolve them .",
    "more generally , use of the @xmath18s can significantly enhance our perception of the sources .    with @xmath19 intensity interferometry accesses the _ cross - polarization _ , an interesting quantity that has been discussed previously @xcite-@xcite",
    "we will call the more general phenomenon linked polarization .",
    "note that in this procedure we have _ gained _ one form of information by _ erasing _ potential information that would have enabled us , in principle , to say which source was responsible for the emission ( even when we ca nt resolve it spatially ) .",
    "that erasure renders two otherwise distinguishable processes to become indistinguishable , and enables their interference .",
    "so far , we have used selective projection to get interference between non - identical emissions .",
    "a more general and powerful technique also exploits entanglement of the detectors . as an extreme example , let us consider that one of our emitters emits bosons @xmath20 , while the other emits fermions @xmath21 . a detector that receives a boson goes into state * b * , while a detector that receives a fermion goes into state * f*. ( see figure 2 . )",
    "@xmath8 +    [ hbtdistinguishable ]   + figure 2 : the same geometry as in figure 1 , but drawn to emphasize the possibility of distinguishable emissions .",
    "@xmath8 + we would like to get interference between the terms in @xmath22 following a similar philosophy to our polarization example , we change the state basis and erase information to access interference .",
    "we can do that directly , using entangled detector states ( procedure 1 ) .",
    "writing @xmath23 we see that by projecting on the entangled state @xmath24 we measure @xmath25    we might also follow the polarization strategy more literally , acting on the detectors separately ( procedure 2 ) . here , with @xmath26 gives us what we want .",
    "procedure 2 requires that we set up coherent superpositions of states that differ by one in fermion number . that may be problematic , because it violates a superselection rule .",
    "procedure 1 is free of that issue , because the two parts of @xmath27 , while they differ in fermion number locally , agree in that respect globally .",
    "below , we shall indicate a geometrical method for realizing this entanglement .",
    "the possibility of measurable boson - fermion interference sheds an interesting light on superselection , emphasizing its global nature .",
    "we can capture both our procedures , and reach a proper generalization , in the following way .",
    "the projectors @xmath11 encode density matrices for the final states of the detectors @xmath5 .",
    "when their states are entangled , however , the density matrix of the entire system will not factorize , and we will need to employ a system density matrix , in the form @xmath28    we should also allow for the interesting possibility of entanglement in the emitters . that is accommodated according to @xmath29    with these notations , we can generalize our formula eqn.([direct ] ) in the form @xmath30 and our formula eqn.([crossed ] ) in the form @xmath31    by comparing experimental data with eqns.([gendirect ] , [ gencrossed ] ) , and determining whether it is consistent with factorization of @xmath32 , we become sensitive to entanglement between the emitters .",
    "this effect could be used as a probe for proposed exotic states of matter that feature long - range entanglement .",
    "it would also be interesting to investigate the possible existence of entanglement and linked polarization in the microwave background radiation .",
    "previously , in order to measure interference between the states of a boson and fermion , we needed to project detector states onto @xmath33 . here",
    "we describe a more geometric way to obtain the desired interference .",
    "say that we have two detectors located at @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the detector located at @xmath0 begins in a fermion accepting state @xmath34 which transitions to @xmath35 if and only if it absorbs a fermion .",
    "similarly , the detector at @xmath1 begins in a boson accepting state @xmath36 which transitions to @xmath37 if and only if it absorbs a boson .",
    "the initial state of the detectors is @xmath38 where we have included states that keep track of the positions of the detectors .",
    "now we put the detectors in an equal superposition of being at their original positions and being in swapped positions as @xmath39 this superposition of swapped and unswapped detectors can be obtained by application of the unitary operator @xmath40 to the spatial states . note that @xmath41 has the property @xmath42 .",
    "if we have a fermion emitter and a boson emitter as before , we will be interested in the terms @xmath43 applying @xmath41 to the terms in eqn .",
    "( [ detectorswapregistered ] ) we obtain @xmath44 projecting on the separable state @xmath45 , we measure @xmath46 as desired .        the preceding strategy , which enables our procedure 1 ,",
    "might also be applied to the interference of photons with different wavelengths .",
    "it is also not difficult to devise , for this application , a quasi - realistic version of procedure 2 , with projection at the separate detectors .",
    "( see figure 3 . )",
    "we imagine producing a definite superposition of atomic states @xmath47 , both of which can transition , upon reception of different - wavelength photons , to a common level @xmath48 .",
    "then the rate for populating @xmath48 will depend on the relative phase between those photons , and exhibits their interference .            a central theme of e@xmath4i@xmath4 is measuring detector states in mixed bases .",
    "we can leverage this technique in situations when there is only a single source . here",
    "we will discuss the interesting case of a single source that is a collection of identical decaying particles .",
    "consider a particle @xmath49 which either decays into two particles of type @xmath50 or two particles of type @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the two decay channels are @xmath52 and @xmath53 which occur with probability amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "typically , when we compute information about a decay process we are interested in the absolute squares of the probability amplitudes @xmath56 , @xmath57 which are measured in standard particle experiments . by considering mixed bases of detector states ,",
    "we gain access to the relative phases between the probability amplitudes",
    "@xmath58 \" denote a source of decaying @xmath49 particles . additionally , we have two detectors at @xmath0 and @xmath1 which are in @xmath59 and @xmath60 accepting states respectively",
    ". we want interference between the terms @xmath61 projecting onto @xmath62 we obtain @xmath63 which gives interference between the probability amplitudes for decay .",
    "a similar procedure can be used to measure relative phases between the probability amplitudes of scattering processes .",
    "the basic concept of e@xmath4i@xmath4 is very flexible . as an example of the possibilities , we outline an alternative realization of the classic mach - zehnder interferometer , wherein entanglement allows us to simplify the geometry .    in mach - zehnder interferometry ,",
    "two alternative paths for a single photon are produced by interposing a beamsplitter and recombining at a detector .",
    "one can complicate propagation in one of the paths by inserting a translucent material and thereby , through the modified interference , obtain information about the material . using the techniques of e@xmath4i@xmath4",
    ", we can measure mach - zehnder interference _ without _ recombination of paths .",
    "consider the setup in figure 4 .",

    "if a photon from the source interacts with an atom in the excited state @xmath70 , then the atom will not absorb the photon and instead the photon will be absorbed by the nearby detector .",
    "we want to consider the terms @xmath71 projecting onto @xmath72 and @xmath73 , each which can be done locally , we get ( up to a constant factor ) @xmath74 which contains the mach - zehnder interference term .",
