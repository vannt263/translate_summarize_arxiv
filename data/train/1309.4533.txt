    "heavy - light meson systems provide some of the best ways to test the standard model and look for signs of new physics . in particular , the constraints on the sides of the unitarity triangle , which come mainly from heavy - light decays and mixings , are limited largely by the size of the theoretical errors in the values of the hadronic matrix elements of weak operators .",
    "lattice qcd provides a means of carrying out non - perturbative calculations of such quantities from first principles and with controlled errors .    in setting up a lattice qcd calculation",
    ", a key choice is the form of the lattice action for the quarks . staggered fermions @xcite are an efficient approach to simulating light quarks .",
    "the `` highly improved staggered quark '' ( hisq ) action @xcite makes it possible to treat charm quarks with the same action as the light quarks .",
    "thus `` all - staggered '' simulations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons are now possible @xcite , and even @xmath5 mesons have been treated in this way by pushing up the heavy quark mass on ensembles with the finest available lattice spacings @xcite .",
    "there are several advantages to this all - staggered approach .",
    "since heavy and light quarks have the same action , there are partially conserved heavy - light axial and vector currents that need no renormalization .",
    "the tuning of the heavy quark mass is also simplified compared to other approaches ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) because difference between `` rest '' and `` kinetic '' masses of the heavy quark due to discretization effects may be neglected .",
    "further , the statistical errors of heavy - light pseudoscalars tend to be rather small , as they are for light - light staggered pseudoscalars .",
    "lattice computations often involve an extrapolation in light quark masses to the physical up and down masses , and always require a continuum extrapolation in lattice spacing .",
    "a version of chiral perturbation theory ( 0.4expt ) that includes the effects of the discretization errors can help to control these extrapolations . here , we develop chiral perturbation theory for all - staggered heavy - light mesons .",
    "we call the theory _ heavy - meson , rooted , all - staggered chiral perturbation theory _ ( ) , where `` rooted '' refers to the fourth root of the staggered determinant , as reviewed below .",
    "staggered quarks have a four - fold degree of freedom , called taste , which is a remnant of lattice doubling . in the continuum limit",
    ", there is an exact @xmath6 symmetry acting on tastes ; this symmetry is broken at @xmath7 in the lattice spacing @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding discretization errors in the light - light sector split the masses of mesons with different tastes , which may be understood using staggered chiral perturbation theory ( s0.4expt ) @xcite . for typical values of @xmath9 ,",
    "the taste splittings of light pseudoscalar mesons can be comparable to the masses themselves .",
    "in short - hand , we say @xmath10 , where factors of @xmath11 to balance the dimensions are always assumed in such relations .",
    "these taste splittings must therefore be included in the leading order ( lo ) light - light lagrangian .    for heavy - light mesons composed of staggered quarks",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "the lo lagrangian in the continuum is of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the residual momentum of the heavy - light meson .",
    "we assume @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath15 , taste violations are of higher order and will be treated as next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections .",
    "the lo heavy - light lagrangian is then taste invariant .",
    "this power counting is consistent with hisq simulations , where the splittings in _ squared _ meson masses remain roughly constant as the valence quark mass increases from the light quark regime to the charm regime @xcite .",
    "therefore the splittings for the masses themselves are much smaller for heavy - light mesons than for light mesons . for example , the taste splitting at @xmath16fm between the root - mean - squared ( rms ) @xmath4 meson and the lightest @xmath4 meson is only about 11 mev @xcite , while it is about 110 mev for the pion .",
    "reference @xcite works out a closely related chiral theory for heavy - light mesons with staggered light quarks but non - staggered heavy quarks ( for example , fermilab @xcite or nrqcd @xcite quarks ) .",
    "that chiral theory has been called _ heavy - meson , rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory _ ( ) . in , heavy - light mesons have a single taste degree of freedom associated with the light quark . as in the current case , the lo  lagrangian in the heavy - light sector",
    "is taste invariant . taste symmetry . ]",
    "since the lo lagrangian determines the propagators and vertices of the one - loop diagrams , those diagrams are very closely related in  and  ( the current case ) .",
    "important differences arise at nlo , however .",
    "such differences affect , for example , the analytic terms that are added on to the one - loop chiral logarithms to give the complete nlo expressions for quantities such as the decay constants .",
    "similarly , mass splittings for heavy - light mesons of different tastes are governed by the analytic nlo terms .",
    "indeed , we prove below that the one - loop diagrams themselves do not give rise to any taste violations in the heavy - light meson masses , despite the fact the light - light masses , which enter those diagrams , do violate taste symmetry .",
    "this feature arises from the combination of exact heavy - quark taste symmetry at lo and the all - orders discrete taste symmetry coming from shift invariance .",
    "thus we need to extend the program developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to include staggered heavy quarks with a taste degree of freedom . in this paper",
    "we assume that the staggered action used ( _ e.g. _ ,  hisq ) is improved sufficiently that we can treat the heavy quark as `` continuum - like , '' with small corrections from cutoff effects .",
    "we refer to this assumption in short - hand as taking @xmath17 , where @xmath1 is mass of the heavy quark , although one should keep in mind that corrections in powers of @xmath18 may in practice be reduced as much or more by the improved action than by the size of @xmath18 _ per se_. under this assumption , we can use the symanzik effective theory ( set ) @xcite to describe the discretization effects on the heavy quarks , as well as on the light quarks .",
    "the set is the effective theory for physical momenta @xmath19 small compared with the cutoff ( @xmath20 ) ; it encodes discretization effects in higher - dimensional operators added to continuum qcd .",
    "when the heavy quark is non - staggered , as in , the heavy - quark doubler states are split from the heavy quark by an amount of order of the cutoff , and are therefore integrated out of the set .",
    "thus the heavy quark fields have no degree of freedom corresponding to taste , and taste violations at @xmath7 appear only in four - quark operators composed exclusively of light quarks .    in the all - staggered case , on the other hand , important taste violations at @xmath7 appear in `` mixed ''",
    "four - quark operators consisting of the product of a heavy quark bilinear and a light quark bilinear , as well as in the product of two light - quark bilinears .",
    "these operators break the taste symmetries of both heavy and light quarks .",
    "( products of two heavy - quark bilinears also appear in the set , but their effect on the heavy - light meson lagrangian is rather trivial since there is at most one heavy quark in all initial and final states considered . )    in the set , the lattice theory has been replaced by a continuum theory .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath8 appears only as a parameter multiplying higher - dimensional operators .",
    "one can then use the fact that @xmath1 is large compared to @xmath11 , to organize heavy quark effects with heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "the heavy quark field @xmath21 in both dimension - four and higher - dimension operators is replaced by a hqet field @xmath22 , where @xmath22 satisfies @xmath23 with @xmath24 the heavy - quark four - velocity .",
    "the dimension - four terms are invariant under heavy - quark spin symmetry , but the higher dimensional terms may violate the symmetry .",
    "finally , when residual momenta and light quark masses are small compared to the chiral scale @xmath25gev , the physics of light - light and heavy - light mesons may be described by a chiral effective theory .",
    "the dimension - four operators give a standard - looking heavy - meson chiral theory , but with additional taste degrees of freedom for both light and heavy quarks .",
    "the higher - dimensional operators may be mapped to the chiral lagrangian using a spurion analysis .",
    "they generate lo terms in the light - light sector that violate light - quark taste symmetry , and nlo terms in the heavy - light sector that violate heavy - quark taste and spin symmetry .",
    "since the four taste degrees of freedom of a staggered quark are unphysical , the fermion determinant is replaced by its fourth root in simulations .",
    "this rooting procedure introduces non - locality : at non - zero lattice spacing , the rooted fermion action is not equivalent to any local action @xcite , which in turn leads to nonlocal violations of unitarity @xcite . in the continuum limit , locality and unitarity are however expected to be restored , an expectation which is supported theoretical arguments  @xcite , as well as other analytical and numerical evidence  @xcite .    in the chiral theory , rooting",
    "is taken into account by multiplying each sea quark loop by a factor of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished either by following the quark flow @xcite to locate the loops , or  more systematically  by replicating the sea quarks @xmath27 , performing a standard chiral calculation , and taking @xmath28 in the result@xcite . here , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and use the quark flow approach .",
    "after the chiral theory is constructed , we first apply it to calculate the taste splittings of heavy - light meson masses at next - to - leading chiral order .",
    "some of the analytic nlo terms break the taste-@xmath6 symmetry of the masses down to @xmath29 symmetry @xcite , while others break the symmetry still further , producing splitting within @xmath29 multiplets .",
    "our results can be used to understand the measured lattice splittings @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the leptonic decay constant of a heavy - light meson at one - loop .",
    "the chiral form we obtain is very useful in the analysis of hisq data for @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite . in general",
    ", we work to lo in @xmath32 , but some higher order terms ( heavy - light hyperfine and flavor splittings ) are considered in the decay constant calculation . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we argue that the inclusion of those terms ( but no other @xmath32 terms ) constitutes a systematic approximation in the power counting introduced by boyd and grinstein @xcite .",
    "as is clear from the above , many features of the analysis of can be used here with only small changes .",
    "however , in reexamining the nlo terms in the lagrangian and current of for use here , we have discovered some minor mistakes : there are a few terms at nlo that were omitted , and a few of the terms listed in the earlier paper can be shown either to be absent or to be redundant with terms already present .",
    "this occurs only for the complicated terms that violate both ( euclidean ) rotation symmetry and taste symmetry .",
    "the errors have no consequences for applications of  in the literature .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in , the lo s0.4expt  lagrangian is constructed for all - staggered heavy - light mesons , and those nlo terms that are the same as in the continuum are briefly discussed .",
    "the @xmath7 terms involving heavy - light mesons are then derived from a spurion analysis in , with a needed reduction of a three - index lorentz tensor into irreducible representations relegated to appendix [ sec : tensor ] .",
    "focuses on taste splittings of heavy - light mesons . finally ,",
    "in , the decay constant in heavy - light systems is calculated to nlo .",
    "our conclusions and some discussion of the results follow in .",
    "in this section , we first introduce our chiral power counting and give our notation for the various contributions that appear at both lo and nlo .",
    "we then consider the lo lagrangian for both the light mesons and heavy - light mesons .",
    "the heavy - light meson field is generalized from that in so that it carries a heavy - quark taste index , in addition to light - quark taste and flavor  or , equivalently , so that it carries meson taste and light - quark flavor indices .",
    "the nlo terms that are invariant under taste symmetry are the same as in the continuum , and are briefly treated in .",
    "we assume the power counting @xmath33 for the light mesons ( `` pions '' ) as in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "@xmath34 is a typical pion momentum , and factors of @xmath11 are implicit .",
    "two additional scales enter with the inclusion of heavy - light mesons .",
    "the first is the residual momentum of the heavy - light meson , @xmath13 , which we take to be of the same order as @xmath34 .",
    "the second scale is the heavy quark mass @xmath1 .",
    "initially , we keep only the leading order in @xmath32 in the following calculations and derive the decay constant of @xmath3 at that order .",
    "we then follow to include hyperfine splittings ( e.g. , @xmath35 ) and flavor splittings ( e.g. , @xmath36 ) in the nlo decay constant calculation .",
    "these splittings are @xmath37 mev , and so not much smaller than @xmath38 , despite the fact that they are formally of order @xmath32 . including the splittings",
    "can therefore be important in practical applications of our results , especially since hisq simulations at physical pion mass are now available @xcite .",
    "furthermore it is consistent to include the splittings at nlo in the power counting of ,    the lo chiral lagrangian is therefore @xmath39 in the heavy - meson fields and @xmath40 in the light - meson fields .",
    "( as usual in hqet , terms of @xmath41 in the heavy - meson fields , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  heavy mass terms , are removed by construction . )",
    "since each loop will bring in two powers of @xmath34 or equivalent scales , we consider terms both of order @xmath42 and of order @xmath43 in the heavy mesons to be nlo , and similarly next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) would include heavy - meson terms of order @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for our purposes here , we need the complete lo lagrangian ( for both heavy and light mesons ) , but only the heavy - meson part of the nlo lagrangian .",
    "we therefore write @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the standard lo light meson lagrangian @xcite , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 denote the heavy - meson terms of order @xmath51 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( or equivalent scales ) , respectively .",
    "we will also need @xmath52 , the left - handed heavy - light current for light flavor @xmath53 and combined taste @xmath54 .",
    "it has the similar expansion @xmath55 where again the subscripts 1 and 2 denote orders in @xmath13 .",
    "we can classify contributions to the nlo terms in eqs .   and by the source of the extra powers of the scale and the nature of any symmetry breaking .",
    "the subscript @xmath13 will denote terms in which the powers come exclusively from additional derivatives as compared to the lo terms , while the subscripts @xmath56 and @xmath9 will indicate insertions of mass or taste - violating spurions , respectively ( together with possible additional derivatives ) .",
    "the taste - violating terms may be further classified according to whether continuum euclidean @xmath29 rotation symmetry is preserved or broken ( `` type a '' or `` type b , '' respectively ) , and whether the heavy - quark taste symmetry is preserved or broken ( `` type 1 '' or `` type 2 '' , respectively ) .",
    "as first pointed out in , type a terms also preserve a @xmath29 taste symmetry of the light quarks , and that feature remains true here .",
    "our classification then gives @xmath57 where @xmath58 comes solely from derivative terms , since mass and taste spurions bring in two powers of the small scale .",
    "after introducing our ( mainly standard ) notation , we give the lo terms @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath59 in the next subsection .",
    "nlo terms that are the same as in the continuum , namely @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are then briefly discussed in .",
    "study of the taste - violating terms , which require a detailed look at the set , are postponed until .",
    "those terms that preserve heavy - quark taste symmetry , namely type a1 and b1 terms , are trivial generalizations of the corresponding terms in @xcite .",
    "those that break heavy - quark taste symmetry , namely type a2 and b2 , are however completely new .",

    "reference @xcite also discusses the extent to which including the splittings as in eq .  , and not other possible @xmath32 effects , is a systematic improvement on eq .  .",

    "@xcite , the lowest pion masses were about half the physical kaon mass , and the power counting of ref .",
    "@xcite was only marginally applicable to the data .",
    "however , for simulations on the hisq ensembles generated by the milc collaboration @xcite , the lowest pion masses are physical , and the assumptions of the boyd - grinstein power counting are well satisfied .",
    "furthermore , including the splittings with such data is not optional : for @xmath3 mesons the hyperfine splitting @xmath486mev , and the flavor splitting @xmath487mev , clearly non - negligible compared to the physical pion mass .    since we have included hyperfine and flavor splittings , which are empirically large even though they are formally of order @xmath32 , it is important to consider whether splittings coming from taste violations should also be included in the heavy - light propagators at one loop . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "taste splittings in squared meson masses are roughly constant as the masses increase from pions to @xmath3 mesons , which means that taste splittings in the heavy - light masses themselves are quite small , @xmath488mev at @xmath16fm for the hisq action .",
    "the taste splittings are indeed higher order compared to the physical hyperfine and flavor splittings .",
    "we note that the taste - violating lagrangian terms in eqs .   and also lead to @xmath7 contributions to hyperfine splittings .",
    "those effects have not been measured in lattice simulations , but we think it is reasonable to assume they are comparable in size to the taste splittings since in most cases the same operators produce both effects .",
    "there is also the question of whether other @xmath32 continuum effects should be included along with the hyperfine and flavor splittings . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , such terms only change the overall normalization of the result for the quantity @xmath489 in eq .   by relatively small amount , of order @xmath490 .",
    "since in any case the value of @xmath491 in eq .   may be considered uncertain by as much as @xmath492 ( the difference between @xmath493 and @xmath494 ) , these additional @xmath32 terms have no practical implications for our results .",
    "we have generalized the chiral lagrangian for heavy - light mesons to the case where both heavy and light quarks have the staggered action .",
    "a fundamental assumption of our work is that lattice spacings is sufficiently small , or the heavy - quark action is sufficiently improved , that we may treat @xmath495 as a small parameter , where @xmath1 is the heavy quark mass .",
    "this is the same assumption required in order to describe heavy quarks with the hisq staggered action in simulations .",
    "the heavy - light part of the lo staggered chiral lagrangian we obtain is identical to that in the continuum , except for extra taste degrees of freedom of the light and heavy quarks .",
    "in contrast with the light - light part of the chiral lagrangian , which includes taste splittings at lo , the heavy - light part of the lo chiral lagrangian is taste - invariant , with three key symmetries : heavy quark spin symmetry , chiral symmetry of the light quarks ( including taste and flavor symmetries ) , and @xmath6 taste symmetry of the heavy quarks .",
    "complications arise at nlo , where these symmetries of the heavy - light lagrangian may be broken by lattice artifacts , as well as by light - quark mass terms .",
    "those nlo contributions that arise from terms in the symanzik effective theory composed exclusively of light quarks may be taken over directly from . in doing so",
    ", we have corrected some minor errors in that reference , which do not affect any existing calculations within that framework .",
    "terms in the symanzik effective theory with heavy staggered quarks are new .",
    "we have derived their consequences for the nlo heavy - light lagrangian , as well as the left - handed current , in some detail . in some cases ,",
    "though , we have not attempted to find the complete set of possible terms , and have contented ourselves with simply listing sufficient numbers of terms relevant to foreseeable practical applications .",
    "we have then applied our lagrangian to calculate , through nlo , the taste splitting of heavy - light mesons and the heavy - light leptonic decay constant . in both these cases , we are able to prove that the one - loop diagrams are taste invariant , despite the fact that they contain pion propagators that break taste symmetry .",
    "this means that taste violations in these quantities at nlo come exclusively from analytic terms , which arise from the nlo lagrangian and current . using our results for the mass splittings , and making assumptions about the dominant operators based on experience with light - light quantities",
    ", we find that we can qualitatively understand the pattern of splittings seen in heavy - light hisq data .",
    "for the decay constant , the nlo taste violations produce a single analytic term that depends on taste of the meson , the term @xmath496 in eqs .   and .",
    "the one - loop diagrams give rise to the same chiral logarithms derived in , because in both cases they are taste invariant .",
    "following , we include the modifications of these chiral logarithms due to heavy - light hyperfine and flavor splittings , which are comparable in size to the physical pion mass , and therefore important for describing modern simulations in which the light quark masses are physical or close to physical .",
    "the resulting chiral form is being used to fit hisq data for decay constants of the @xmath3 system @xcite .",
    "although such fits may be bypassed for data at physical quark masses @xcite , the chiral fits allow one to include data at unphysical quark masses , and thereby one can hope to obtain smaller statistical errors and better control over continuum extrapolation errors .",
    "the work in progress indicates that these hopes are realized in practice .",

    "we are grateful to our colleagues in milc for the use of data on hisq splittings .",
    "in , we need to reduce a 3-index tensor to irreducible lorentz representations in order to find the type - b2 chiral form for the current .",
    "the reduction is done explicitly here . for present convenience",
    "we work in euclidean space and use euclidean rotational symmetry ( plus parity ) instead of lorentz symmetry , so we do not have to worry about upper and lower indices .",
    "consider a tensor @xmath497 , which may be taken to be traceless on the second two indices @xmath498 , where sum over @xmath203 is implied . will be used as a summation index , and sum over it is always implied when it appears twice .",
    "however , all other indices are not summed over , even when they appear more than once . ]",
    "the tracelessness may be assumed because the trace term will simply reproduce type - a contributions , as in the discussion of @xmath286 .",
    "in addition , we may just consider the reduction of the part of @xmath339 that is symmetric on the second two indices , @xmath499 since we will ultimately be interested in writing only the element @xmath500 in terms of irreducible tensors , and the antisymmetric part will not contribute .",
    "the tensor @xmath501 transforms as the product of a vector ( on the first index ) and a traceless symmetric tensor ( on the second and third indices ) . to see what representations appear , we use the fact that @xmath502 to denote irreducible tensors by their spin under the two @xmath115 factors",
    "a vector is the @xmath503 representation , while a traceless , symmetric two - index tensor is the @xmath504 representation .",
    "the product thus contains @xmath505 , @xmath506 , and @xmath503 , where parity interchanges the two @xmath115 factors , making a single representation out of the second component .",
    "the highest representation must be symmetric , and @xmath505 corresponds to a completely symmetric , three index tensor @xmath507 , which is traceless on any pair of indices : @xmath508 .",
