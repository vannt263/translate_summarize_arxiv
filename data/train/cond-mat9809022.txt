    "the time delay in a quantum mechanical scattering problem is related to the energy derivative of the scattering matrix @xmath3 .",
    "although the notion of such a relationship goes back to the historical works of eisenbud @xcite and wigner @xcite , the first to propose a matrix equation linking time delay and scattering matrix was smith @xcite .",
    "he introduced the hermitian matrix @xmath7 , now known as the wigner - smith time - delay matrix , and interpreted its diagonal elements as the time delay of a wave packet incident upon the scatterer in one of @xmath8 scattering channels .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath4 of @xmath5 are referred to as the `` proper delay times '' .    in recent years ,",
    "the issue of time delay and its connection to the scattering matrix has received considerable attention in the context of chaotic scattering @xcite .",
    "examples are the scattering of electromagnetic or sound waves from chaotic `` billiards '' or the transport of electrons through so - called `` chaotic quantum dots '' @xcite . in both cases the scattering matrix @xmath1 and the time - delay matrix @xmath5 have a sensitive and complicated dependence on microscopic parameters , such as the energy @xmath9 , the shape of the cavity , or ( in the electronic case ) the magnetic field . as a result ,",
    "a statistical approach is justified , in which one addresses the statistical distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath5 for an ensemble of chaotic cavities , rather than the precise value of these matrices for a specific cavity .    for the scattering matrix @xmath1",
    ", there is considerable theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite evidence that its distribution is uniform in the group of @xmath10 unitary matrices , restricted only by fundamental symmetries , if the cavity is coupled to the outside world via ballistic point contacts . this universal distribution is dyson s circular ensemble of random - matrix theory @xcite . the fundamental problem is to calculate the distribution of the time - delay matrix @xmath5 for this case of ideal coupling .",
    "known results include moments of @xmath11 @xcite and the entire distribution for the case @xmath12 @xcite of a scalar scattering matrix .    in a recent paper @xcite we succeeded in computing the entire distribution for any dimensionality @xmath8 of the scattering matrix .",
    "we found that the eigenvalues @xmath13 of @xmath5 are statistically independent of the scattering matrix @xmath1 , with a distribution that is most conveniently expressed in terms of the inverse delay times @xmath14 , @xmath15 here @xmath16 depending on the presence or absence of time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry , @xmath17 is the heisenberg time , and @xmath18 is the mean level spacing of the closed cavity .",
    "the function @xmath19 is zero if any one of the @xmath20 s is negative .",
    "this distribution is known in random - matrix theory as the ( generalized ) laguerre ensemble @xcite .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath5 are not independent of @xmath1 , except in the case @xmath21 of broken time - reversal symmetry . for any @xmath22",
    "the correlations are transformed away if @xmath5 is replaced by the symmetrized matrix @xmath23 which has the same eigenvalues as @xmath5 .",

    "we present a detailed and self - contained derivation of these results , focusing on those parts of the derivation that have not or only briefly been discussed in ref .  .",
    "we feel that a detailed presentation of this derivation is important , because it relies on an old conjecture by wigner @xcite that had not been proven before in the literature .",

    "the conjecture concerns the invariance of the distribution functional @xmath2 $ ] of the ensemble of energy dependent scattering matrices under unitary transformations @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 two energy - independent unitary matrices ) .",
    "our proof of wigner s conjecture is based on the hamiltonian approach to chaotic scattering @xcite , which connects the scattering matrix @xmath3 of the open cavity with leads to the hamiltonian @xmath32 of the closed cavity without leads .",

    "historically , the wigner - smith matrix @xmath34 was introduced to study the time evolution of a wave packet .",
    "this application is limited to the average delay time @xcite , essentially because knowledge of the full time dependence requires also higher derivatives of @xmath1 than the first .",
    "still , there exist physical observables that are entirely determined by @xmath5 .",
    "some examples that have been discussed in the recent literature are the capacitance or admittance of a quantum dot @xcite , and the thermopower @xcite .",
    "in addition to the energy derivative @xmath35 , one may study the derivative of @xmath1 with respect to an arbitrary external parameter @xmath36 .",
    "such a parameter can represent the shape of the cavity , the magnetic field , or a local impurity potential .",

    "in summary , we have presented a detailed derivation of the joint distribution @xmath117 of the scattering matrix @xmath1 and the symmetrized time delay matrix @xmath244 of a chaotic cavity with ideal leads .",
    "our result , which was first reported in ref .  , reads @xmath245 where @xmath17 is the heisenberg time and @xmath18 is the mean level spacing in the cavity .",
    "the distribution @xmath117 depends on the eigenvalues @xmath4 of @xmath119 only ; it does not depend on @xmath1 , nor on the eigenvectors of @xmath119 .",
    "our derivation was based on an old conjecture by wigner @xcite , which we have proven in this paper , that the distribution functional @xmath2 $ ] of the ensemble of energy - dependent scattering matrices is invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "we generalized wigner s conjecture to the dependence of @xmath1 on an external parameter @xmath36 and derived the distribution of parametric derivatives .    throughout this paper",
    "we assumed ideal coupling of the chaotic cavity to the electron reservoirs .",
    "this requires ballistic point contacts . for the case of non - ideal coupling ,",
    "i.e.  if the point contacts contain a tunnel barrier , the distribution of the scattering matrix @xmath1 is given by the more general poisson kernel instead of the circular ensemble @xcite .",
    "for this situation , application of wigner s conjecture is not correct and our method can not be used to determine @xmath117 . a possibility to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to separate the direct and the fully ergodic scattering processes , by expressing the scattering matrix for non - ideal coupling as a composition of an @xmath10 scattering matrix @xmath246 of a fully ergodic and chaotic scatterer and a scattering matrix @xmath247 of dimension @xmath248 describing the direct scattering processes @xcite , @xmath249 where the matrices @xmath228 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and @xmath252 are @xmath10 submatrices of @xmath247 , @xmath253 the energy dependence of @xmath247 can be neglected on energy scales corresponding to the inverse dwell time inside the cavity .",
    "thus one obtains a relation between the statistical distributions of the time delay matrices for the cases of non - ideal and ideal coupling .",
    "what remains is the cumbersome mathematical problem to perform the corresponding transformation of the different matrix variables . to our knowledge ,",
    "no closed - form formula for the joint distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath119 is known , except for the case @xmath12 @xcite .    the supersymmetric approach used in refs .",
    "@xcite is typically more general and systematic concerning the issue of non - ideal coupling , since there the particular symmetries of the scattering matrix ensemble in the ideal coupling case are not directly exploited .",
    "on the other hand , this technique is usually restricted to the computation of certain green function averages only , and does not give access to the full distibution of the time - delay matrix .",
    "we believe that , in principle , in the supersymmetric approach it should be possible to determine averages of the form @xmath254 for arbitrary @xmath71 ( and hence the density of delay times ) and for arbitrary coupling , without having to increase the dimension of the supermatrices involved .",
    "however , in order to get access to the full distribution of the matrix @xmath119 , or at least to moments of the type @xmath255 , one has to increase the dimension of the supermatrices accordingly , which makes it apparently impossible to go beyond the case @xmath256 @xcite .",
    "it is amusing that the ( now proven ) half - a - century old conjecture of wigner provides a route to the simple result ( [ eq7.1 ] ) that seems unreachable by later supersymmetric techniques .",
