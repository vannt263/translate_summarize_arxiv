    "low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) is the most popular extension of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is vigorously sought at lep , and has been and will continue to be actively looked for in the previous and forthcoming runs of the fermilab tevatron collider  @xcite .",
    "there are many possible manifestations of low - energy susy . with more than 100 new parameters",
    ", theorists have out of necessity invented high scale models with drastically fewer parameters .",
    "these models can have qualitatively distinct low - energy spectra , leading to a variety of collider signatures . in this paper",
    "we explore the reach of the tevatron in the parameter space of the most commonly considered model , the minimal supergravity model  @xcite . as in many models ,",
    "this model respects gaugino mass unification .",
    "this implies that in the physical low - energy spectrum the electroweak gauginos are significantly lighter than the gluino , so that their production cross sections are the largest in the allowed regions of parameter space .",
    "in addition to a large production cross section we want a significant branching fraction into a channel with relatively small standard model background .",
    "with all this in mind , the trilepton ( 3l ) signal , @xmath2 with @xmath3 or @xmath4 , has been considered a gold - plated mode for susy discovery at the tevatron @xcite , prompting several run i analyses at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "the 3l signal is mainly produced via @xmath5 .",
    "being one of the most extensively studied channels for susy discovery , it was naturally among the main focal points of the run ii workshop @xcite , where the emphasis was placed on optimizing the analysis cuts in order to maximize the run ii tevatron reach .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we took this approach further by considering thousands of sets of cuts in order to determine which one gives the best reach .",
    "we also supplemented our trilepton susy search with two other promising signatures  the inclusive like - sign dilepton  @xcite and ` dilepton plus a tau jet '  @xcite channels .",
    "along with the mandatory plots of the tevatron reach in parameter space , the main result from @xcite was that the sm background has been grossly underestimated in the previous studies ( @xcite , and to some extent in @xcite ) .",
    "we traced the main cause of the problem to the inadequacy of the event generator isajet @xcite in simulating the sm @xmath6 and @xmath7 backgrounds . in isajet",
    "the zero width approximation is used in generating both @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in pythia @xcite",
    ", a breit - wigner distribution is used for the @xmath1- and @xmath8-bosons .",
    "the finite @xmath8-width leads to broader dilepton spectra and hence significantly larger background .",
    "the @xmath0 background is not incorporated in either isajet or pythia .",
    "hence , it has not been taken into account in previous studies ( see , however , refs .",
    "we find that this background is larger than all previously considered backgrounds combined . in light of the importance of the trilepton channel for run",
    "ii , we are compelled to update our analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we were faced with several options as to how to incorporate the @xmath0 process we implicitly refer to the @xmath8-@xmath9 interference as well . ] .",
    "there are several parton level monte carlo generators which use the full set of diagrams ( see fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ) to generate what is loosely called `` @xmath6 '' , but in reality is the @xmath10 process @xmath11 .",
    "three such generators are madgraph @xcite , comphep @xcite and mcfm @xcite .",

    "we want to not only generate @xmath6 events with the correct kinematics , but also to include a full detector simulation as we did in @xcite , making use of the shw package @xcite .",

    "the resulting parton - level cross section was integrated with the cteq4 m structure functions @xcite .    unfortunately , with a standard set of cuts @xcite the @xmath0 background is about 2.7 fb , which is larger than all previously considered backgrounds combined ( 2.1 fb  @xcite ) .",
    "this new source of background dwarfs previous estimates .",
    "for example , it is over 4 times the _ total _ background found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and our total background is now more than 8 times the total background reported in  @xcite .",
    "these recent developments necessitate the invention of new cuts , specifically designed to suppress the off - shell @xmath24 component of the background . one obvious variable to consider is the invariant mass @xmath25 of an opposite sign , same flavor lepton pair in the event .",
    "the inclusion of the off - shell photon contribution increases the relative weight of events with low @xmath25 . in anticipation of this effect , in ref .",
    "@xcite we employed a low invariant mass cut of @xmath26 gev .    in fig .",

    "[ im2l]b we enter both combinations , each with weight @xmath31 .",
    "first we see that neglecting the virtual photon contribution and the @xmath32 interference leads to a significant underestimate of the @xmath6 background .",
    "in fact , the virtual photon contribution diverges in the limit @xmath33 !",
    "second , the low - end invariant mass cut @xmath26 gev that we used in @xcite is clearly not very efficient in suppressing the additional @xmath9 background and the cut threshold needs to be increased .",
    "the optimum threshold will depend on the signal distribution , whose shape is controlled by the value of the chargino mass @xmath34 and is thus parameter space dependent .",

    "we choose the optimal one at each point in susy parameter space ( for further details on our optimization procedure , see  @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ ptl ] we compare the comphep and pythia @xmath23 distributions of the leptons .",
    "we see that most of the additional events due to the @xmath9 contribution tend to have small @xmath23 .",

    "we see that although the inclusion of the @xmath9 background leads to a significant increase in the raw background cross section , the reach is somewhat similar to what was presented in ref .",

    "we use the following notation to describe the set of cuts at each point .",
    "the central symbol indicates the set of lepton @xmath23 cuts : the symbols `` 1 '' through `` 5 '' refer to @xmath58 and @xmath59 gev lepton @xmath23 cuts , respectively .",
    "the left superscript shows the value ( in gev ) of the low - end invariant mass cut ( @xmath60 to 60 gev ) .",
    "a left subscript `` t '' indicates that the cut on the transverse @xmath38 mass was selected .",
    "the right superscript shows the @xmath61 cut : @xmath62 gev ( `` 15'',``20'',``25 '' ) , or no cut ( no symbol ) .",
    "a right subscript denotes the high - end dilepton invariant mass cut : @xmath63 gev ( `` 10'',``15 '' ) or @xmath64 gev ( `` 50'',``60'',``70'',``80 '' ) . and",
    "finally , a tilde over the central symbol indicates that the luminosity limit came from requiring 5 signal events rather than @xmath40 exclusion .    in fig .",
    "[ bc5_m0_small ] we see that in the regions where background is an issue , the combination of the @xmath37 cut and a tighter low - end dilepton mass cut @xmath65 gev is typically preferred . indeed , we find that these additional cuts reduce the @xmath6 background by more than a factor of 3 , from 4.1  fb ( with soft cuts @xcite ) to 1.2  fb .",
    "notice , however , in the small @xmath42 case the transverse mass cut is never enough by itself , i.e. whenever it is chosen , it is almost always supplemented with a @xmath66 cut of 15 to 25 gev ( with the exception of two points with high lepton @xmath23 cuts ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are significant regions where the low invariant mass cut @xmath66 by itself is enough to kill the background , and the transverse mass cut is not needed . in the large @xmath42 case the transverse mass is always chosen at small @xmath49 , but only occasionally at large @xmath49 .",

    "[ bc5_m0_small ] and [ bc35_m0_small ] can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "first , for a given total integrated luminosity , say 10 @xmath67 , one can first roughly look up from fig .",
    "[ 3l ] the sensitivity reach of the tevatron .",
    "then , for the parameter space well inside the sensitivity region , the actual choice of cuts is not so crucial .",
    "however , as one approaches the boundary of the sensitivity region , the choice of optimum cuts as a function of parameter space ( as opposed to a fixed , non - optimized set of cuts ) can enhance the reach by an additional 10 - 20 gev along the @xmath55 direction  @xcite . alternatively , at a given parameter space point near the border , optimization can reduce the total integrated luminosity required to observe or exclude that point by up to a factor of two @xcite .    in conclusion , we find that the trilepton channel remains one of the leading candidates for susy discovery at the tevatron .",
    "the other two channels are in a sense complementary , although not as powerful .",
    "the dilepton plus tau jet channel can be combined straightforwardly with the trilepton channel to maximally increase the reach . with the new very important @xmath68 background",
    "included , the reach of course suffers somewhat .",
    "we find that with only the standard run 2 luminosity of 2 fb@xmath54 the reach is quite limited . with the larger background it is even more imperative that the tevatron collect as much luminosity as possible to have a decent chance at discovering supersymmetry .",
