    "it is widely believed that the most promising candidate for an unified theory including quantum gravity is superstring theory .",
    "it is therefore interesting to prove or disprove superstring theory from an observational point of view . to this end",
    ", primordial gravitational waves have been considered as the most efficient probe , since the gravitational waves can carry the information of the universe at the planck time .    in this paper , we focus on a robust prediction of superstring theory , namely , the parity violation due to the gravitational chern - simons term .",
    "in fact , the chern - simons term appears in the green - schwarz mechanism which is necessary to cancel the anomaly in the theory  @xcite .",
    "it also arises as a string correction  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the existence of the chern - simons term can be probed by the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "this is because the chern - simons term can generate the circular polarization of gravitational waves through the parity violation . while it is difficult to find other effects to produce the circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves",
    "hence , if we detect the circular polarization in the primordial gravitational waves , it would be a strong indication of existence of the chern - simons term in the early universe .",
    "thus , it can be interpreted as an evidence of superstring theory .",
    "in addition to this fundamental motivation , there is a phenomenological interest in chern - simons gravity as an alternative theory of gravity  @xcite .",
    "even from this phenomenological point of view , the circular polarization of gravitational waves deserve detailed investigation .    concerning the issue",
    "if the chern - simons term can produce the primordial gravitational waves with circular polarization , there has been already several works  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that , however , there exists no observable amount of circular polarization of gravitational waves  @xcite , if the background spacetime undergoes the standard slow - roll inflation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to point out that this disappointing result is reversed if we properly take into account another stringy effect .",
    "the point is that the chern - simons term is not the only term that could be induced by the stringy corrections .",
    "there is another term , the so - called gauss - bonnet term .",
    "if we consider the chern - simons term , it would be mandatory to incorporate the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "hence , we consider both terms , the gauss - bonnet and chern - simons terms , and study a possibility to have the circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the reason we expect a different result from the one obtained from the standard slow - roll inflation is the existence of the super - inflationary phase induced by the gauss - bonnet term  @xcite . and more importantly ,",
    "as was firstly discovered in  @xcite , there exists an instability in gravitational wave modes during the super - inflationary stage .",
    "it is this instability that generates the circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "in fact , we show the primordial gravitational waves are fully polarized due to the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we also discuss the detectability of the polarization of gravitational waves .",
    "the detectability of circular polarization of gravitational waves depends on when the super - inflation occurs .",
    "since the curvature perturbation has a blue spectrum in the super - inflationary regime , we need to assume the super - inflation occurs in the late stage of the slow - roll inflation . as a realization",
    ", we propose a two - field inflation model where the circular polarization of gravitational waves could be produced in the bbo  @xcite or decigo  @xcite frequency range .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present basic equations .",
    "first , we study the evolution of the background spacetime in the gauss - bonnet - chern - simons gravity . for the background evolution , the gauss - bonnet term is crucial , while the chern - simons term plays no role .",
    "we show there are two types of inflation , namely , the standard slow - roll inflation and the super - inflation .",
    "next , we derive equations for gravitational waves . here",
    ", the chern - simons term plays an important role . in section iii",
    ", we explain the essential mechanism to produce the circular polarization of gravitational waves .",
    "we quantize the gravitational waves in the super - inflationary background and calculate the degree of the circular polarization of gravitational waves .",
    "there , we will show that the significant circular polarization is created due to the instability caused by the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we note that the model presented in this section is just for illustration .",
    "more realistic modes are considered in the next section . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the detectability of the circular polarization generated during the super - inflationary regime .",
    "we point out the defect of the single - field inflation model .",
    "then , as a model consistent with current observations , we propose a two - field inflation model where gauss - bonnet and chern - simons term couple with the inflaton only in the second stage of the inflation .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "before discussing primordial gravitational waves from the quantum fluctuation during the inflation , we need to reconsider the chaotic inflationary scenario driven by an inflaton @xmath0 with a potential @xmath1 .",
    "although the chern - simons term does not alter the background geometry , the gauss - bonnet term change the inflationary scenario at the early stage of the inflation .",
    "the change would be important for the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "we start with the action motivated from string theory given by  @xcite @xmath2    -\\frac{1}{16}\\int{\\rm d}^4x\\sqrt{-g } \\xi ( \\phi)r^2_{\\rm gb }   + \\frac{1}{16 }   \\int{\\rm d}^4x\\sqrt{-g } \\omega ( \\phi)r\\tilde{r } \\ ,   \\label{act0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term of action is the einstein - hilbert term and @xmath3 is the determinant of the metric @xmath4 .",
    "we have set the unit @xmath5 . in the above action ( [ act0 ] ) ,",
    "we have taken into account the gauss - bonnet term @xmath6 and the chern - simons term @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the levi - civita tensor density .",
    "we have also allowed the coupling of the inflaton field both to the gauss - bonnet @xmath9 and chern - simons terms @xmath10 .",
    "otherwise , these topological terms vanish identically .",
    "it should be noted that , as is well known , the chern - simons term does not contribute to the dynamics of the isotropic and homogeneous universe .    from now on , for simplicity , we consider a typical potential , @xmath11 .",
    "we also specify the coupling function @xmath12 for concreteness , although we keep them in the formula as far as we can . for other coupling functions ,",
    "the analysis is similar and easy to perform .",
    "let us consider the background spacetime with spatial isotropy and homogeneity .",
    "then , the metric is given by @xmath13 \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have also assumed the flat space and used the conformal time @xmath14 . taking the variations of the action ( [ act0 ] ) , we have equations @xmath15 where we have defined @xmath16 . here",
    ", the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath14 .    in the conventional case , namely , without the gauss - bonnet term , the hubble friction in the equation of motion for the scalar field makes the rolling of the scalar field slow .",
    "then , the slow - roll inflation is soon realized for the initial condition with a large hubble .",
    "however , in the presence of the gauss - bonnet term , the force due to the gauss - bonnet term becomes dominant for a large value of @xmath0 .",
    "if the scalar field start with a negative value , the force term accelerate the scalar field and makes the kinetic term dominant .",
    "hence , the situation , @xmath17 , is realized .",
    "thus , eqs.([eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) become @xmath18 the scalar field @xmath0 rolls down from the negative side towards zero according to the above equations ( [ super1 ] ) and ( [ super2 ] ) . now , it is easy to solve eqs.([super1 ] ) and ( [ super2 ] ) as @xmath19 we note that the super - inflation @xmath20 is realized in this phase . here , @xmath21 is the hubble parameter .",
    "as the scalar field rolls down , the gauss - bonnet term decreases .",
    "eventually , the conventional hubble friction overcome the gauss - bonnet effect and the slow - roll inflation commences .",
    "a typical evolution of the spacetime is shown in fig.[evol ] .        in the super - inflationary phase @xmath22",
    ", the weak energy condition is violated .",
    "hence , the system may show the instability .",
    "of course , as you can see in fig .  1 , this instability is a transient one . to make this point clear ,",
    "we rewrite the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) as the autonomous system for @xmath0 and @xmath23 and plot the phase flow diagram in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .     is drawn .",
    "the thick line in the diagram denotes the trajectory corresponding to fig .",
    "this tells that the asymptotic solution breaks down before reaching @xmath24 , and thus the singularity is avoided . ]",
    "this diagram shows that the super - inflationary phase will be followed by the standard phase where the hubble parameter is decreasing .    in the next section",
    ", we will show that the transient super - inflation phase gives rise to the circular polarization of gravitational waves .      in this subsection",
    ", we will deduce the quadratic action for the gravitational waves from the action ( [ act0 ] ) .",

    "the circular polarization has the property @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the right and left - handed circular polarizations , respectively .",

    "the coefficient of the wavenumber @xmath48 may be interpreted as the square of the speed of sound waves .    in the long wavelength limit",
    ", we have the solution @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the constants of integration . in the conventional inflationary scenario",
    ", the first term corresponds to the growing mode which is actually constant when we translated back to the metric perturbations .",
    "hence , the primordial gravitational waves are frozen on super - horizon scales . however , in the presence of gauss - bonnet and chern - simons terms , the role of the growing and decaying modes are interchanged .",
    "this gives rise to an interesting effect on the polarization .",
    "in this section , we present a mechanism to produce the circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the interplay between the instability induced by the gauss - bonnet term and the parity violation due to chern - simons term is essential for the mechanism .",
    "the mechanism is efficient and generic in the sense that both terms are ubiquitous in string theory .",
    "now , let us quantize the gravitational waves and calculate the degree of polarization .",
    "what we should do is to promote @xmath51 to the operator and expand by mode functions @xmath52 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the complex conjugate of @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the annihilation and creation operators .",
    "the mode functions @xmath55 satisfies the same equation for @xmath51 .",
    "once the positive frequency mode @xmath55 is specified , the vacuum is define by @xmath58 then , we can calculate the vacuum fluctuations @xmath59 here , we focus only on the gravitational waves which leaves the horizon during super - inflationary phase , because the gravitational waves still under the horizon when super - inflation ends are the same as those of the slow - roll inflation .    during the stage",
    "prior to the slow - roll inflation , @xmath60 can be approximated as @xmath61 in spite of this simplification , it is still difficult to solve the equation of motion analytically .",
    "hence , we solve the equation at super - horizon scale and sub - horizon scale , separately .",
    "after that , we connect these solutions smoothly at the horizon crossing .",
    "first , let us consider the sub - horizon scale , @xmath62 or @xmath63 . leaving the terms up to the order of @xmath64",
    ", we obtain the equation @xmath65 this can be solved analytically by using confluent hypergeometric functions . instead of doing that",
    ", we estimate the degree of the polarization approximately",
    ". the initial condition can be set by imposing the bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "more precisely , we choose the positive frequency mode @xmath66 in the asymptotic past .",
    "namely , deep inside the hubble horizon , both the left and right polarization modes are simply oscillating . at the time @xmath67",
    ", the asymmetry shows up . after that time , @xmath68",
    ", we can approximate the solutions as @xmath69 where we have used wkb approximation which is valid for the period we are considering . to determine the constants of integration @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ", we have to match solutions smoothly at @xmath72 as @xmath73 apparently , both @xmath74 and @xmath71 are not zero . hence , for the left - handed circular polarization modes",
    "@xmath75 , the solution shows damping oscillation . while , for the right - handed circular polarization mode @xmath76 , the solution grows rapidly .",
    "it is this instability due to the gauss - bonnet term that produces the difference between the left and right - handed circular polarization modes .",
    "the ratio can be quantified by @xmath77 thus , we can expect the fully polarized gravitational waves .    to make the analysis more accurate , we need the solutions to continue to the super - horizon scale , @xmath78 or @xmath79 . on the super - horizon scales ,",
    "the solution can be obtained as @xmath80 this can be solved easily as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants of integration . to determine the constants @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    ", we have to match solutions smoothly at @xmath84 as @xmath85     as a function of wave numbers @xmath48 is shown .",
    "as expected , the gravitational waves are almost 100% circularly polarized . ]    what we want to calculate is the degree of the circular polarization defined as the difference between the power of right and left - handed circularly polarized gravitational waves at the end of the super inflation phase : @xmath86 where @xmath87 represents the time when the super - inflation ends .",
    "we have performed matching analysis and displayed a numerical result in fig.[eta ] . because of",
    "the behavior just before the horizon crossing , namely right - handed circular polarization mode is growing and left - handed circular polarization mode is decaying , consequently the net polarization is produced .",
    "the resultant polarization is sufficiently large and hence detectable by bbo or decigo .    to calculate the spectrum of the polarization of gravitational waves which",
    "is directly observed today , we have to connect solutions from super inflation phase to the slow - roll inflation , radiation dominant , and matter dominant phase .",
    "this part of calculations is standard and does not alter the polarization .",
    "finally , we should mention a subtle point in the calculation . from the definition of @xmath60 ( [ za ] ) ,",
    "it is obvious that there is a point @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "that occurs close to the time when the left - handed circular polarization mode cross the horizon .",
    "there , the solution behaves as @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are constants of integration .",
    "we can see that @xmath93 , in the limit @xmath94 , so it causes no problem to solve the eq.([eom_gw ] ) . however , the relevant quantity is the physical amplitude @xmath95 , rather than @xmath96 , namely , @xmath97 apparently , the physical amplitude diverges at @xmath94 . in the previous work  @xcite ,",
    "this issue was serious , because this divergence means the breakdown of the linear analysis .",
    "it suggests that we should take into account the non - linear effect which is not available . in our case ,",
    "the relevant mode is the right polarization mode which has no divergence problem .",
    "as the breakdown of the linear analysis occurs just at the horizon crossing , the non - linear effects works almost instantaneously .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to assume that the non - linear effect for the left - handed circular polarization mode hardly affects the evolution of the right - handed circular polarization mode .",
    "therefore , we believe the consequence about the degree of polarization does not change .",
    "first of all , we should emphasize that the analysis done in the previous section is explanatory .",
    "the frequency range where the circular polarization is created will change depending on when the super - inflation occurs . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the indirect detection through cmb and the direct detections by interferometer",
    ".    as to the in - direct detection of circular polarization through the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , the required degree of circular polarization has been obtained as @xmath98  @xcite , where @xmath99 is the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "the relevant frequency in this case is around @xmath100 hz . as to the direct detection of circular polarization ,",
    "the required degree of circular polarization has been estimated as @xmath101 around the frequency @xmath102 hz  @xcite , where @xmath103 is the density parameter of the stochastic gravitational waves and snr is the signal to the noise ratio . here , 10 years observational time is assumed .",
    "of course , for the isotropic component of circular polarization of stochastic gravitational waves , one needs to break the symmetry of the detector configuration .     for the power spectrum of primordial gravitational waves as a function of wavenumbers @xmath48",
    "is shown . in the relevant frequency range , we have obtained the spectral index @xmath104 numerically . ]    thus , in order to know if we can detect polarized gravitational waves , we need the degree of the polarization , the intensity of the gravitational waves @xmath103 or the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath99 , and also the spectrum around the relevant frequency ranges . as we have shown already , we can get the polarization @xmath105 easily .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to get the required @xmath103 or @xmath99 provided standard model parameters .",
    "we can calculate the spectrum numerically assuming the bunch - davis vacuum .",
    "we have presented a numerical result in fig.[spectrum ] .",
    "this result can be understood analytically .",
    "in fact , the initial mode function behaves @xmath106 inside the horizon which should match to the growing mode @xmath107 on the super horizon scales . matching condition at @xmath108 gives the @xmath48 dependence of the coefficient @xmath82 as @xmath109 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath110 .",
    "consequently , the power spectrum for the gravitational waves becomes @xmath111 .",
    "since the spectrum has the blue index @xmath112 , the polarization would be detectable even in the low intensity case .",
    "now , the point is the frequency range , namely , the time when the polarization is created . in the following discussion , we will mainly focus on this issue .    in the case of the single inflaton model we have discussed , the frequency where the circular polarization is significant lies around the cmb scale @xmath113 hz .",
    "hence , there is a possibility for the circular polarization to be indirectly detected through the cmb observation , more precisely , through the temperature and @xmath114 mode or @xmath115 mode and @xmath114 mode correlations  @xcite . in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", it is argued that a high degree of polarization is necessary for the polarization to be detected in the future observations .",
    "the high degree of polarization can be attainable by the mechanism we have found in this paper .",
    "however , in this simple model , we have to worry about the curvature perturbations which is also expected to have the blue spectrum during the super - inflation .",
    "one possible way out of this problem is to assume the curvature perturbation created by the inflaton is negligible and to resort to the curvaton scenario  @xcite as is common to the pre - big - bang type models  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear if the concrete realization of this kind of model is possible .",
    "moreover , one may feel that introducing the curvaton mechanism into the scenario is not appealing even if it exists .",
    "fortunately , there exists another interesting possibility",
    ". we will devote the remaining part of this section to the model which is consistent with observational constraints .    to circumvent the problem of the curvature perturbations",
    ", we propose a two - field inflation model defined by the action @xmath116",

    "the main difference between our model and the conventional inflation model is simply the gauss - bonnet and chern - simons term . in the first stage , the field @xmath118 drives the slow - roll inflation . during this stage",
    ", the field @xmath0 takes a constant large field value .",
    "hence , both the gauss - bonnet and the chern - simons terms are decoupled from the system . during this conventional inflationary period ,",
    "the temperature fluctuations of cmb are created .",
    "and the spectrum of the fluctuations is almost flat .",
    "then , at some point , the motion in the direction of @xmath0 is triggered and the gauss - bonnet and chern - simons terms take part in the dynamics . in this second stage ,",
    "the @xmath0 field rolls down the hill rapidly and the gauss - bonnet term induces a super - inflationary phase . during this stage",
    ", the circular polarization of the primordial gravitational waves is produced through the parity violation of the chern - simons term .",
    "subsequently , the second standard slow - roll inflation driven by the same field @xmath0 takes over .    here",
    ", we present an example .",
    "is sticked to the point @xmath119 and the other scalar field @xmath118 slowly rolls down to give rise to the inflation .",
    "at some point , @xmath0 starts to roll down toward @xmath24 .",
    "then , the coupling to the gauss - bonnet term induces the super - inflation where the circular polarization of gravitational waves is created .",
    "subsequently , the standard slow - roll inflation follows . ]",
    "the potential function is @xmath120\\right\\}^2   + \\frac{1}{2}m_\\chi^2   \\chi^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_{\\rm m}}\\right)^2 v_{\\rm m}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameters are set as @xmath121 this potential is shown in fig .",

    "it could be observed directly through the interferometer detector . ]        for this model , the duration of the first and second slow - roll inflation is tunable .",
    "hence , it is possible to have the gravitational waves with the significant circular polarization in the bbo or decigo frequency range ( see fig.[picture ] ) . since the spectrum is blue , even the ground based detectors may find the circular polarization as is pointed out recently  @xcite .    to make a more precise prediction of the polarization of gravitational waves",
    ", we need more complete analysis .",
    "in particular , we should calculate the spectrum of the curvature perturbations of this model .",
    "we leave these details for future publications  @xcite .",
    "we have studied a mechanism to produce the circular polarization of gravitational waves in the string - inspired cosmology .",
    "it turned out that the circularly polarized gravitational waves are ubiquitous in string cosmology .",
    "the point we have observed is that there are two key terms in string theory , namely , the chern - simons term and the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "the chern - simons term violates the parity invariance , therefore it makes a room for the circularly polarized gravitational waves to be produced .",
    "however , in the previous works  @xcite , it had been shown that there is no significant circular polarization of gravitational waves within the conventional inflationary scenario . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that the gauss - bonnet term reversed the previous conclusion .",
    "the gauss - bonnet term has changed the background evolution in such a way that the super - inflationary epoch appears during the conventional inflationary stage . during the super - inflation",
    ", there exists an instability in the tensor modes .",
    "it is the instability that produces a significant circular polarization @xmath105 .",
    "we have also discussed the detectability of the polarization . we have shown that the detectability depends on the specific scenario of inflation . in the single - field inflation model",
    ", the circular polarization would be observable at the cmb scale .",
    "the consistency with the observation of the temperature fluctuations requires the curvaton scenario in this case .",
    "to circumvent the situation , we have also proposed a two - field inflation model . in the two - field model , the frequency range where the circular polarization is produced depends on the parameter . it would be possible to make a model to produce gravitational waves with circular polarization in the bbo or decigo frequency range . in this case ,",
    "curvature fluctuations on large scales are produced by the standard slow - roll inflation .",
    "hence , we do not need the curvaton scenario any more .",
    "there are several directions to be explored .",
    "we should investigate the two - field inflation model in detail  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to seek a concrete realization of the model in the string landscape .",
    "it is also intriguing to search other mechanism to produce a circular polarization of gravitational waves .",
    "one simple possibility is to consider the non - vacuum initial state in lorentz violating inflationary scenario  @xcite .",
