    "two valuable tools have been developed to study lattice - based algebras : the theory of canonical extensions and the theory of topological dualities .",
    "although the two methodologies have largely been developed separately , they have a symbiotic relationship . in this paper",
    "we present a new approach to the canonical extension of a bounded lattice , based on the dual representation due to ploica  @xcite .",
    "this yields a construction with strong affinities with the theory of natural dualities ",
    "one which has clear categorical merits .",
    "we shall consider only lattices which are bounded , and include the universal bounds , @xmath0 and  @xmath1 , in the signature ; we denote the variety of all such lattices by  @xmath2 .",
    "the subvariety of @xmath2 consisting of distributive lattices is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "the canonical extension of a member @xmath4 of @xmath2 is a particular lattice completion @xmath5 of @xmath4 , having two properties , known as _ density _ and _ compactness _ ; we recall the definitions below .",
    "these properties characterise this completion uniquely , up to an isomorphism fixing the original lattice .",
    "the existence of canonical extensions for members of  @xmath2 was first established by gehrke and harding @xcite , drawing on the theory of galois connections ; specifically ,  @xmath5 arises as the complete lattice of galois - stable sets associated with the polarity @xmath6 between the filter lattice @xmath7 and the ideal lattice @xmath8 of @xmath4 given by @xmath9 if and only if @xmath10 .",
    "further insight into the relationship between @xmath4 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath5 was supplied by gehrke and priestley @xcite .    the original investigation by gehrke and jnsson @xcite of canonical extensions in the distributive case built @xmath5 by exploiting priestley duality .",
    "of course , uniqueness of the canonical extension ensures that this construction leads to the same completion as do the ( specialisations of ) the constructions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however the translations between the various concrete realisations of the canonical extension of a distributive lattice are rather indirect .",
    "more significantly , there are obstacles to extending , in a fully satisfactory and transparent way , the duality approach beyond the distributive case .",
    "therefore we contend that it is worthwhile to explore in greater detail than hitherto the interface between canonical extensions and duality theory for lattices , and a categorical context for these .",
    "each of priestley duality for @xmath3 and stone duality for boolean algebras , @xmath13 , is an instance of a natural duality .",
    "indeed , these dualities provided prototypical examples for the general theory , as presented in the text of clark and davey @xcite . in its basic form",
    ", the theory of natural dualities applies to a prevariety @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is some finite algebra .",
    "one sets up functors @xmath16 and @xmath17 between @xmath18 and a suitable category @xmath19 of structured boolean spaces .",
    "here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are hom - functors into , respectively , @xmath15 and @xmath22 , where @xmath22 is an alter ego for @xmath15 , that is , an object in @xmath19 whose underlying set is the same as that of @xmath15 . if , for a suitable choice of @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath23 for all @xmath24 , then we say we have a _ duality _ ; this suffices to give a topological representation for the members of @xmath18 .",
    "( optimally , one also has @xmath25 for all @xmath26 and hence a dual category equivalence between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , but such _ full dualities _ are not of relevance here . ) in the case of @xmath13 and @xmath3 , the algebra @xmath15 is a two - element algebra , and @xmath22 is the set @xmath27 equipped with the discrete topology and , respectively , no relations and a single relation , _ viz . _",
    "the order relation @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the functors  @xmath30 and  @xmath31 act on morphisms by composition , and this is a key feature of the way in which the duality operates .",
    "moreover , by modifying the functors  @xmath30 and  @xmath31 , one arrives at a functorial construction of the canonical extension  one which makes overt its categorical relationship to the duality .",
    "the canonical extension construction can then be viewed in the way shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsquare ] . in the figure",
    ", @xmath32 denotes the functor forgetting the topology and the functor @xmath33 acts in the same manner as  @xmath21 does , but on untopologised rather than topologised structures .",
    "the codomain @xmath34 of  @xmath33 can be taken to be the category of doubly algebraic distributive lattices with complete lattice homomorphisms .",
    "in fact , more is true : there is a hom - functor  @xmath35 adjoint to  @xmath33 such that  @xmath35 and  @xmath33 set up a dual equivalence between  @xmath34 and  @xmath36 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however the functor  @xmath35 is not involved in the factorisation of  @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "we do make use of  @xmath21 : @xmath38    [ ht ]    & & _",
    "+ ^^ & & _ + ^+ & _ g &    unlike @xmath13 and @xmath3 , the variety @xmath2 of bounded lattices is not finitely generated .",
    "this prevents it from coming within the scope of the theory of natural dualities .",
    "however there is available a long - established representation of bounded lattices due to urquhart  @xcite .",
    "this does not stem from a dual category equivalence but it does provide a concrete topological representation of each @xmath39 . of greater relevance to us here",
    ", though , is the recasting of urquhart s work by ploica  @xcite .",
    "this was motivated by natural duality theory , and is in the spirit of that theory .",
    "in barest outline , ploica s extension of the priestley representation is accomplished by replacing total maps into @xmath27 , _ qua _ lattice or _ qua _ partially ordered set , by appropriate maximally - defined partial maps of the same sort .",
    "one may then conjecture that , _ mutatis mutandis _",
    ", the canonical extension of an arbitrary bounded lattice may be obtained in the same manner as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsquare ] by ` forgetting the topology ' at the level of the ploica first dual .",
    "the principal result of section  [ newce ] , theorem  [ canext ] , confirms that this is indeed the case . in preparation ,",
    "section [ prelim ] summarises the key notions presented in ploica s paper @xcite , investigates the basic properties of the corresponding concepts for the topology - free setting , and reveals the interplay between the topologised and untopologised versions .",
    "we emphasise that the validation of our construction of the canonical extension is independent of pre - existing theory of canonical extensions for @xmath2 : we rely solely on the characteristic density and compactness properties , to ensure that , for @xmath39 , our candidate for @xmath40 contains an isomorphic copy of  @xmath4 .",
    "( a detailed discussion of the role of polarities in our framework , and a reconciliation of alternative approaches will be presented separately ( craig and haviar ,  @xcite ) . )",
    "so , at the object level , we have a construction which mimics the duality technnique used in the distributive case .",
    "but it is with morphisms that obstacles arise with duality theory for  @xmath2 .",
    "we are nonetheless able to present a functorial construction , and one in which the canonical extension functor factorises in a manner analogous to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsquare ] .",
    "some sacrifice is unavoidable to achieve this , and in our approach this is the enlargement of the first dual space of  @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , our factorisation aligns with the duality for  @xmath2 due to allwein and hartonas  @xcite and so it is expedient to recast the allwein and hartonas representation at the object level in the ploica style .",
    "we retain a critical feature of the natural duality framework , _ viz . _",
    "that the functors involved behave very like hom - functors . by saying a functor , @xmath41 say , is ` very like ' a hom - functor , we mean that there is some fixed target ,  @xmath42 say ( not necessarily in the codomain of  @xmath41 ) , such that  @xmath41 sends an object  @xmath43 to a specified set of partial maps from  @xmath43 into  @xmath44 and that  @xmath41 acts on morphisms by composition .",
    "thus we are able to retain key features present in the distributive case at the cost of amending the ancillary functors into which the functor @xmath45 splits , but without having to change the very natural way in which these functors act ( see figure [ fig : lsquare ] in section [ cat ] ) .",
    "the major work involved in carrying out our programme is in verifying that the functors we require are well - defined .",
    "once this is done , the lifting of homomorphisms to canonical extensions goes through very cleanly .",
    "we could have worked with the allwein and hartonas duality from the outset and essentially bypassed ploica s representation .",
    "we have elected not to do this for two reasons .",
    "firstly , in certain applications morphisms are not important , and it is then advantageous to have a construction which coincides in the distributive case with the usual duality - based one . secondly , we are able to convert the ploica - style construction at the object level to one based on the enlarged first dual space , and so do not need to start afresh to encompass morphisms .",
    "we note that canonical extensions of lattices provide a platform for studying lattice - based algebras ( also known as lattice expansions ) . a valuable recent survey of canonical extensions for lattice - based algebras , including a discussion of their important role in the semantic modelling of logics , is given by gehrke and vosmaer  @xcite .",
    "in this section we set up the framework within which we shall construct the canonical extension of a bounded lattice @xmath4 . in outline , we look at the structures , and associated maps , obtained by deleting the topology from the dual spaces employed in ploica s representation .",
    "we thereby arrive at a complete lattice which we shall later show serves as @xmath5 .",
    "we begin by recalling some basic definitions concerning completions .",
    "a _ completion _ of a ( bounded ) lattice @xmath4 is defined to be a pair @xmath46 where @xmath43 is a complete lattice and @xmath47 is an embedding .",
    "an element of a completion @xmath46 of a ( bounded ) lattice  @xmath48 which is representable as a meet ( join ) of elements from @xmath49 is called a _ filter element _ ( _ ideal element _ ) . filter (",
    "ideal ) elements are called closed ( open ) elements in the older literature .",
    "the sets of such elements will be denoted @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "a completion @xmath46 of  @xmath48 is said to be _ dense _ if every element of  @xmath43 is both a join of meets and a meet of joins of elements from @xmath49 ; it is said to be _ compact _ if , for any sets @xmath52 with @xmath53 , there exist finite subsets @xmath54 and @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .",
    "canonical extension _ of @xmath4 is a dense and compact completion .",
    "as noted above , every bounded lattice @xmath4 has a canonical extension and any two canonical extensions of @xmath4 are isomorphic via an isomorphism that fixes the elements of  @xmath4 .",
    "the central idea in ploica s representation of bounded lattices  @xcite is the replacement of total maps by partial maps .",
    "let @xmath57 .",
    "a partial map @xmath58 between bounded lattices is called a _ partial homomorphism _",
    "if its domain is a 0,1-sublattice of @xmath59 and @xmath60 is an @xmath2-homomorphism .",
    "a partial homomorphism is said to be _ maximal _ if there is no partial homomorphism properly extending it ; such a map is referred to as an mph for short . by zorn s lemma",
    ", every partial homomorphism can be extended to an mph .",
    "for bounded lattices @xmath4 and @xmath61 , we denote by @xmath62 the set of all mph s from @xmath4 to @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath63 denote , respectively , the two - element bounded lattice and the two - element ordered set with @xmath29 .",
    "the topological structures @xmath64 and @xmath65 are obtained by adding the discrete topology @xmath66 to @xmath67 and  @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "following ploica @xcite , for any bounded lattice @xmath4 , the topological dual space of  @xmath4 is defined in the following way .",
    "we equip the set @xmath69 with the binary relation @xmath70 defined by the rule @xmath71 when needed , we also endow it with the topology @xmath66 which has a subbasis of closed sets all sets of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",

    "the topology of @xmath75 is t@xmath76 and moreover , it is compact ( cf .",

    "* lemma 6 ) ) .",
    "if the lattice @xmath4 is distributive , then @xmath77 , the relation @xmath70 coincides with the pointwise partial order of maps and @xmath75 is the usual dual space of @xmath4 in the priestley duality  @xcite .",
    "ploica s representation of @xmath39 is then obtained in the following way .",
    "one takes the family of continuous @xmath70-preserving partial maps from @xmath75 into @xmath65 , where @xmath70 on @xmath68 is taken to be the usual order .",
    "the maximally - defined members of this set are then shown to form a lattice isomorphic to  @xmath4 , the isomorphism being given by the natural evaluation map @xmath78 .",
    "we recall further details of the construction in section  [ newce ] .    our strategy for obtaining the canonical extension @xmath40 of @xmath4 will be to replace @xmath75 above by @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath80 is the composition @xmath81 , where @xmath32 is the map forgetting the topology .",
    "thus the category we shall use to build the canonical extension will be the category @xmath82 of graphs @xmath83 and partial maps which preserve  @xmath70 .",
    "( we warn that what we are calling a _ graph _ would usually be referred to as a _ digraph_. we also warn that structures of the form @xmath79 will have special properties we shall need to exploit in due course . )",
    "much of our work leading up to theorem  [ canext ] involves checking that the ancillary results on the graphs with topology which underlie the ploica representation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  1 ) have appropriate analogues in the topology - free setting .",
    "initially we let @xmath83 be any graph . for two graphs @xmath84 and",
    "@xmath85 we use the notation @xmath86 to denote the collection of total @xmath70-preserving maps from @xmath87 to @xmath88 . in section [ cat ] we will make use of the set of partial morphisms , @xmath89 .",
    "we note that , by zorn s lemma , every partial @xmath70-preserving map into @xmath68 can be extended to a maximal partial @xmath70-preserving map ; by ` maximal ' we mean here that there is no partial @xmath70-preserving map properly extending it ( in general such an extension will not be unique ) .",

    "but , as the example in fig .  [ fig : nonmax ] demonstrates , @xmath386 need not be maximal .",

    "urquhart was able to set up a dual representation for surjective @xmath2-morphisms but not for @xmath2-morphisms in general .",
    "therefore our example should come as no surprise .",
    "moreover , it is very easy to see that @xmath386 is maximal if @xmath387 is a surjective morphism and  @xmath385 an mph .",
    "a solution to the problem of making duality for lattices functorial was proffered by hartung @xcite , using topological contexts , but this approach does not fit our needs .",
    "our remedy is quite different .",
    "we shall call on the topological representation of bounded lattices due to allwein and hartonas  @xcite .",
    "this is in the same style as that of urquhart , in that it makes use of disjoint filter - ideal pairs of  @xmath4 to construct a dual space for  @xmath4 .",
    "however such pairs are not required to be maximal , as they are in urquhart s representation .",
    "allwein and hartonas thereby overcome the problem encountered by urquhart and are able to set up a dual equivalence between  @xmath2 and a specified category of topological structures .",
    "this is achieved at the cost of working with a greatly enlarged dual space .",
    "a key feature of priestley duality is its ` logarithmic ' property ( cf .",
    "* section  6.3 ) ) . for a finite lattice , moving to a dual space which is bigger than the lattice itself constitutes a major sacrifice , and much of the appeal and power of duality for distributive lattices is lost .",
    "this doubtless explains why the work of allwein and hartonas has attracted little attention .",
    "however the allwein  hartonas duality , recast , insofar as this is necessary , in terms of suitable partially defined morphisms , provides exactly the formalism we need to achieve our aim of linking the canonical extension construction to duality in a functorial way , as in fig  [ fig : lsquare ] .",
    "we shall now outline what we have to do to carry out our programme .",
    "first of all , we require a ploica - style presentation of the allwein  hartonas dual spaces .",
    "the first task is to recognise which partial homomorphisms from  @xmath4 into  @xmath67 correspond to disjoint filter - ideal pairs and appropriately to equip the resulting set of partial homomorphisms with the structure of a graph with topology .",
    "we may consider the full subcategory @xmath392 of @xmath162 whose objects are the enlarged dual spaces ( in our graph formulation , given below ) of members of  @xmath2 .",
    "we then let @xmath376 be the image of @xmath392 under  @xmath393 .",
    "because of their provenance , we shall refer to the objects of  @xmath376 as _",
    "@xmath2-graphs_.    the results of allwein and hartonas @xcite",
    "imply that there are contravariant functors @xmath394 and @xmath395 which are such that @xmath379 for every @xmath39 ; we show that the isomorphism is set up by evaluation maps in the same manner as in proposition  [ lem - eval ] ( see propositions  [ eabar ] and  [ mpm = ea ] ) .",
    "there is now an obvious candidate for the canonical extension of  @xmath4 : we forget the topology on @xmath396 and take the set of all maximal partial morphisms into  @xmath68 . rather than verifying directly that we thereby obtain a dense and compact completion we instead set up an order - isomorphism between our new candidate for the canonical extension and the one based on the ploica representation .",
    "finally we check out that we really do have a well - defined functor @xmath380 making the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsquare ] commute , and at the same time use our diagram to confirm , in a transparent way , that @xmath397 does lift each @xmath2-morphism to a complete lattice homomorphism .",
    "we now implement the strategy we have set out .",
    "let @xmath39 .",
    "then the disjoint filter - ideal pairs of @xmath4 are obviously in bijective correspondence with those partial homomorphisms @xmath385 into @xmath67 , for which @xmath398 is a ( disjoint ) filter - ideal pair of @xmath4 ; let us call them _ special partial homomorphisms _ , sph s for short , and denote the set of all such maps by @xmath399 .",
    "we note that every maximal partial homomorphism into @xmath67 is special but that it is easy to find examples of partial homomorphisms into @xmath67 which fail to be special .",

    "since @xmath546 , there exists @xmath430 such that @xmath547 . by part",
    "( i ) we have that @xmath524 , and since @xmath548 , we get @xmath549 .",
    "this yields that @xmath550 is not @xmath541-preserving , a contradiction .",
    "now let @xmath468 . since @xmath551 , there exists @xmath552 with @xmath553 .",
    "but then @xmath554 and so @xmath550 is not @xmath541-preserving , a contradiction . we have shown the maximality of @xmath525 .",
    "it is easy to see from the definition that @xmath560 is @xmath561-preserving .",
    "suppose there exists @xmath562 such that @xmath563 .",
    "consider first the case where @xmath564 with @xmath565 .",
    "this implies that there exists @xmath566 such that @xmath547 .",
    "consider @xmath404 defined by @xmath407 and @xmath567 .",
    "we can extend @xmath568 to @xmath569 and by lemma  [ 3.5 + 3.7new ]  ( i ) we get @xmath570 .",
    "but @xmath571 and @xmath572 , contradicting @xmath550 being @xmath561-preserving . using the same method",
    "we can show that the existence of @xmath573 implies that @xmath550 can not be @xmath561-preserving .",
    "hence @xmath574 .    by the definition of the lattice order of @xmath575 ( see theorem  [ compl ] )",
    ", it suffices to prove @xmath576 . if @xmath577 then for all @xmath566 , we have @xmath532 where @xmath578 . in particular this",
    "applies to all @xmath579 .",
    "hence @xmath580 and so @xmath581 .",
    "if @xmath582 , there exists @xmath566 such that @xmath547 .",
    "let @xmath583 be defined by letting @xmath407 and @xmath408 .",
    "we know that we can extend @xmath568 to an @xmath584 .",
    "now @xmath585 and so by lemma [ 3.5 + 3.7new](i ) we have that @xmath586 .",
    "since @xmath587 , we have @xmath588 and so clearly @xmath589 .",
    "thus @xmath590 .",
    "the surjectivity of @xmath521 has been proved .",
    "that @xmath521 is an order - isomorphism can be seen from the fact that @xmath261 if and only if @xmath262 ( see theorem  [ compl ] ) , and this occurs if and only if @xmath595 ( by lemma  [ 1.3-mod ] ) , which , in turn , occurs if and only if @xmath596 ( by the definition of @xmath521 ) .          we are almost ready to define the functors needed in our categorical approach .",
    "first , we make some observations about the relationship between the categories we defined earlier : @xmath82 , of graphs and @xmath70-preserving maps , and its topological analogue @xmath162 , of graphs with topology and continuous @xmath70-preserving maps .    from lemma  [ 2.1new ]",
    "we note that any @xmath2-graph @xmath83 is automatically equipped with the quasi - orders @xmath210 and @xmath211 , as previously defined .",
    "thus , when considering  @xmath87 it is not necessary explicitly to state that @xmath210 and @xmath211 are part of the structure of  @xmath87 .",
    "we note too that on @xmath68 ( which is not an @xmath2-graph ) we have quasi - orders @xmath210 and @xmath211 defined as follows : @xmath597 we shall use the symbol @xmath68 to denote both the graph @xmath598 and the doubly - ordered set @xmath599 .    the quasi - order relations @xmath210 and @xmath211 were used by allwein and hartonas  @xcite as well as by urquhart  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , urquhart  @xcite defines two maps @xmath600 and @xmath601 , given by @xmath602 for @xmath603 .",
    "the maps @xmath604 and @xmath605 are order - reversing on @xmath606 and form a galois connection . a subset @xmath603 is defined to be _",
    "@xmath604-stable _ if @xmath607 and _ @xmath605-stable _ if @xmath608 .",
    "the following result is a simple consequence of the theory of galois connections .",
    "now we define morphisms between @xmath2-graphs .",
    "it is obvious that we would want any such morphism to preserve the two quasi - orders @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "we also want morphisms to preserve the way in which these two quasi - orders interact with one another .",
    "this we achieve by requiring that inverse images of stable subsets of the codomain be stable sets in the domain of the morphism .",
    "we state this more precisely below",
    ".            we can now give formal definitions of our categories @xmath392 and @xmath376 : the former consists of @xmath2-graphs with continuous @xmath2-graph morphisms ; the latter is obtained by applying  @xmath393 to  @xmath392 .",
    "lemma  [ lgraph->epres ] serves to tell us that category  @xmath376 ( respectively @xmath392 ) is a full subcategory of @xmath82 ( respectively @xmath162 ) .",
    "let @xmath620 and suppose that @xmath621",

    "since @xmath615 is @xmath210-preserving , we have that @xmath623 , and since @xmath615 is @xmath211-preserving , we have @xmath624 . thus there exists @xmath625 with the required properties , and so @xmath626 .    not for the first time we are faced with the need to reconcile two notions which might possibly not coincide",
    ". we shall now prove that mpe s from @xmath2-graphs into  @xmath68 are exactly the maximal partial @xmath2-graph morphisms into  @xmath68 .",
    "we start by showing the equivalence of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "if @xmath91 and @xmath430 then , by lemma [ 1.3-mod ] , for all @xmath473 we have that @xmath455 .",
    "since @xmath630 implies that @xmath215 , we have for all @xmath473 that @xmath631 and hence @xmath632 . thus @xmath633 .",
    "if we suppose that @xmath252 , then by lemma  [ 1.3-mod ] we have that there exists @xmath473 such that @xmath405 . now by lemma  [ 2.1new](i ) there exists @xmath568 such that @xmath409 and @xmath253 and lemma [ 3.5 + 3.7new](ii ) gives us that @xmath233 .",
    "thus @xmath634 and hence @xmath635 .",
    "we can similarly show that @xmath636 .    now assume ( 2 ) and let @xmath637 . to show that @xmath169 preserves @xmath70 ,",

    "we get @xmath641 , and @xmath247 gives @xmath642 .",
    "lemma [ 2.1new](i ) gives us that there exists @xmath568 such that @xmath643 and @xmath644 .",
    "now @xmath645 means that for all @xmath646 we have @xmath647 and hence @xmath648 .",
    "this implies that there exists @xmath649 such that @xmath650 .",
    "the transitivity of @xmath211 then implies that @xmath651 , a contradiction . in order to see that @xmath169 is maximal ,",
    "suppose that @xmath652 for some @xmath121 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath653 and @xmath654 . if @xmath655 and @xmath656 , then @xmath455 and hence @xmath657 and @xmath658 .",
    "thus any @xmath655 must be in @xmath659 and similarly @xmath660 .",

    ", we get that for any @xmath620 , if @xmath640 and @xmath247 , then @xmath671 and @xmath632 . by the definition of @xmath604 and @xmath605 we see that @xmath657 and @xmath631 .",
    "thus @xmath169 is @xmath210- and @xmath211-preserving on its domain .",
    "since the sets @xmath665 and @xmath666 are the @xmath605- and @xmath604-stable subsets of @xmath68 , we have that  @xmath169 obeys properties ( ii ) and ( iii ) required of an @xmath2-graph morphism .",
