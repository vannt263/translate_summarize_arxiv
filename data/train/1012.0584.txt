    "the @xmath5 years since the discovery of the first exoplanet around a solar - like star @xcite have seen a revolution in our understanding of planet formation and evolution . observations and theoretical modeling have worked hand - in - hand to discover and explain new architectures of planetary orbits .",
    "it is now well known that many exoplanets have large @xmath3 compared to our solar system planetary orbits , indicating an active dynamical history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent rm measurements of many transiting planets are putting further constraints on theoretical models of various planet formation and evolution scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , recent measurements find a large population of highly inclined planetary orbits , and even some retrograde orbits ( see contributions from winn et  al . and triaud et  al . in this volume ) .",
    "planet migration models generally predict alignment between the planetary orbital angular momentum and the stellar spin axis from an aligned protoplanetary disk .",
    "thus high - inclination orbits suggest dynamical evolution to be important in shaping the exoplanet architectures .",
    "alternatively , inclined orbits might also result if the inner portion of the protoplanetary disk itself had been misaligned ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also lai et  al . in this volume ) .",
    "recent high - contrast imaging has revealed another class of planets  giant planets at very large @xmath1 .",
    "timescale considerations for the core - accretion model of planet formation indicates that forming these planets in situ may be hard ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead , we consider formation at closer orbital separations followed by planet ",
    "planet scattering to launch planets in large-@xmath1 orbits from dynamically active systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these simulations predict that these orbits typically also have high @xmath6 .",
    "interestingly , some of the observed large-@xmath1 systems also have disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and dynamical modeling of these disks indicates moderate values of @xmath7 .",
    "we have started to explore the possibility that a planet launched into a large-@xmath1 and high-@xmath3 orbit can later be circularized near its apocenter if the planet enters a debris disk during its apocenter excursion .    in section  [ inclination ]",
    "we summarize our numerical setup and present results for expected inclinations from planet  planet scattering . in section",
    "[ long ] we discuss how planet ",
    "planet scattering followed by circularization due to a residual disk may create moderate-@xmath3 giant planets at large @xmath1 . in section  [ conclude ] we conclude .",

    "the initial innermost planet is placed at @xmath13 , and the other @xmath14 planets are placed with planet  planet separation of @xmath15 hill radii .",
    "the initial @xmath1 s were chosen to avoid mean - motion resonances .",
    "the initial @xmath3 for the planetary orbits are chosen uniformly between @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "initial @xmath18 is chosen uniformly between @xmath19@xmath20 with respect to the initial innermost orbital plane .",
    "all phase angles are assigned random values in the full range .",
    "each of the above configurations is integrated using the hybrid integrator of mercury6.2 @xcite for @xmath21 .",
    "if the energy conservation is poorer than @xmath22 then the full integration is repeated using the burlisch - stoeer ( b - s ) integrator ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : inclination ] shows the distributions of the final inner- and outer - planet orbital inclinations with respect to the initial invariable plane , as well as the relative inclinations between the orbits .",
    "we find that planet ",
    "planet scattering is very efficient at exciting the inclination of planetary orbits .",
    "these high inclinations are not mere reflection of the initial inclinations .",
    "there is in fact no correlation between the initial and final inclinations .",
    "starting from only moderate inclinations planet  planet scattering can create large inclinations extending all the way to retrograde orbits ( although only about @xmath23 in these simulations ) .",
    "the relative inclinations between the planetary orbits in systems where two giant planets remain bound are also high ( median @xmath24 ) . note that the median value is incidentally in good agreement with the recent relative inclination measurement for @xmath25andromidae ( c & d , @xmath26 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our simulations",

    "we explore the following scenario .",
    "a massive disk of rocky material ( possibly relic from the planet - formation process ) remains at large separation from the star .",
    "this disk can remain relatively undisturbed for some time while the planets remain much closer to the star . at some point in the evolution , planet ",
    "planet scattering launches one of the planets into a large-@xmath1 , and high-@xmath3 orbit so that the giant planet enters the disk near apocenter .",
    "the keplerian velocity of the planet near apocenter is less than that of the material in the disk as long as the @xmath3 of the planet is higher than the typical @xmath3 of the disk material .",
    "thus , while in the disk the planet experiences a force due to dynamical friction from the disk in the direction of the planet s orbital velocity , increasing the planet s orbital energy and angular momentum . as a result , the planet s pericenter is raised as the orbit is circularized .",
    "the amount of migration and the timescale for circularization are directly proportional to the disk density .    using the b - s integrator in mercury6.2",
    "we simulate the evolution of a giant planet orbit initially in a large-@xmath1 and high-@xmath3 orbit ( possibly created via a planet ",
    "planet scattering event ) .",
    "the initial @xmath1 , and @xmath3 of the planetary orbit are @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "note that , in this case our @xmath33 is after a planet  planet scattering event in a multi - giant planetary system that has launched a giant planet into this orbit .",
    "a disk of material is distributed initially between @xmath34@xmath30 with a uniform surface density .",
    "the mass in the disk is represented in our simulations by @xmath35 equal - mass particles .",
    "the disk particles interact with the planet but not with each other .",
    "initial @xmath3 and inclination of the disk material are chosen uniformly between @xmath16@xmath36 and @xmath19@xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the planetary orbit is assumed to be aligned with the mid - plane of the disk ( as a first step ) .",
    "we use two models varying the initial disk surface densities ( @xmath38 ) keeping everything else fixed .",
    "our model1 and model2 have @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : long ] shows the evolution of the planetary orbit as well as the surface density contours of the disk . for model1 ( figure  [ fig : long ] , left )",
    ", the planet first migrates outwards from @xmath31 to @xmath41 in @xmath42 .",
    "note that the outward migration happens via circularization of the planetary orbit near the planet s apocenter . at the end of this migration",
    "the planet is in an orbit with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the outward migration is halted when the planet s intrusion severely depletes the disk . until then the planet s evolution is dominated by dynamical friction arising from the disk . during this process",
    "the planet scatters a part of the disk material inwards ( seen as a strip of over - density extending inwards )",
    ". the subsequent evolution of the planetary orbit is governed by random scattering events between the planet and disk particles .",
    "the planet migrates inwards by scattering outwards disk particles that the planet had previously scattered inwards .",
    "this is a much slower process compared to the initial dynamical - friction dominated outward migration .",
    "the @xmath3 is damped throughout the entire process . at the integration stopping time ( @xmath45 )",
    "the planet is in an orbit with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "qualitatively similar behavior is noted in the evolution of the planetary orbit for model2 .",
    "however , in this case the timescale of the outward migration is about @xmath48 times longer ( @xmath49 ) and the magnitude of migration is less by a factor of @xmath48 compared to model1 . at the end of the dynamical - friction - driven outward migration the planetary orbit has @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this stage of evolution is followed by the planet ",
    "disk particle scattering stage during which the planet migrates inwards . at the integration stopping time ( @xmath21 ) for model2 the planetary orbit has @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    in both cases at the end",
    "the planet is ( or will be ) left in a large-@xmath1 , and modest-@xmath3 orbit .",
    "in addition , the total mass in the disk is reduced dramatically .",
    "the intrusion of the giant planet also excites the @xmath3 and inclination of the disk material .",
    "furthermore , a low density disk may remain outside the planetary orbit which may then , over time , grind to create a dust ring via collisions , similar to the one observed in fomalhaut - b .",
    "using numerical simulations we have studied how planet ",
    "planet scattering can naturally create high - inclination orbits .",
    "we have studied whether giant planets can be launched into large-@xmath1 , but modest-@xmath3 orbits , similar in architecture to fomalhaut - b , via planet  planet scattering .",
    "we find that planet ",
    "planet scattering can naturally create many large-@xmath1 orbits , however , these orbits are also expected to have high @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless ,",
    "if a massive outer disk exists and the scattered giant planet near its apocenter enters the disk , dynamical friction from the disk can raise the planet s @xmath1 until the planet reduces the disk density significantly via scattering . then the planet can migrate inwards via scattering some of the remaining disk particles outwards . during the whole process the @xmath3 of the planetary orbit reduces .",
    "we plan to further study this process in detail exploring different disk masses , densities , as well as varying planet masses .",
    "we thank the soc and loc for arranging this excellent conference and the opportunity to present these results ."
