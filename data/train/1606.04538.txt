    "the advanced laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) is designed to detect the final inspiral and merger of compact object binaries comprised of neutron stars ( ns ) and/or stellar - mass black holes ( bh ) @xcite .",
    "the first ligo observing run ( designated o1 ) commenced on 18 september 2015 with the ability to detect binary neutron star ( bns ) mergers to an average distance of @xmath14 mpc , a forty - fold increase in volume relative to the previous generation of ground - based gw detectors @xcite . on 2015",
    "september 14 ligo detected the first gw event ever observed , gw150914 @xcite .",
    "the waveform of gw150914 was consistent with the inspiral , merger , and ring - down of a binary black hole ( bbh ) system ( @xmath15 m@xmath16 ; @xcite ) providing the first observational evidence that such systems exist and merge . while there are no robust theoretical predictions for the expected electromagnetic ( em ) counterparts of such a merger , more than 20 teams conducted a wide range of follow - up observations spanning from radio to @xmath17-rays , along with neutrino follow up @xcite .",
    "this effort included deep optical follow - up observations by our group using decam covering 100 deg@xmath0 ( corresponding to a contained probability of 38%  ( 11% ) of the initial  ( final ) sky maps )  making this one of the most comprehensive optical follow - up campaigns for gw150914 @xcite .",
    "our search for rapidly declining transients to limiting magnitudes of @xmath18 mag for red @xmath19 and @xmath20 mag for blue @xmath21 events yielded no counterpart to gw150914 @xcite .",
    "one result of the broader multi - wavelength follow - up campaign is a claimed coincident detection of a weak short gamma - ray burst ( sgrb ) from the _",
    "fermi_/gbm detector 0.4 s after the gw event @xcite .",
    "however , this event was not detected in integral @xmath17-ray data @xcite and was also disputed in a re - analysis of the gbm data @xcite .",
    "a second high - significance gw event , designated gw151226 , was discovered by ligo on 2015 december 26 at 03:38:53 ut @xcite .",
    "this event was also due to the inspiral and merger of a bbh system , consisting of @xmath22  m@xmath16 and @xmath23  m@xmath16 black holes at a luminosity distance of @xmath24  mpc @xcite .",
    "the initial localization was provided as a probability sky map via a private gcn circular 38 hours after the gw detection @xcite .",
    "we initiated optical follow - up observations with decam 10 hours later on 2015 december 28 , and imaged a 28.8 deg@xmath0 region in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands during several epochs .",
    "here we report the results of this search . in section  [ sec : obs ] we discuss the observations and data analysis procedures . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we present our search methodology for potential counterparts to gw151226 , and the results of this search .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we perform cosmological calculations assuming @xmath25  km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "magnitudes are reported in the ab system .",
    "gw151226 was detected on 2015 december 26 at 03:38:53 ut by a compact binary coalescence ( cbc ) search pipeline @xcite .",
    "the cbc pipeline operates by matching the strain data against waveform templates and is sensitive to mergers containing ns and/or bh .",
    "the initial sky map was generated by the bayestar algorithm and released 38 hours after the gw detection .",
    "bayestar is a bayesian algorithm that generates a localization sky map based on the parameter estimation from the cbc pipeline @xcite .",
    "the sky area contained within the initial 50% and 90% contours was 430 deg@xmath0 and 1340 deg@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "a sky map generated by the lalinference algorithm , which computes the localization using bayesian forward - modeling of the signal morphology @xcite , was released on 2016 january 15 ut , after our decam observations had been concluded .",
    "the lalinference sky map is slightly narrower than the sky map from bayestar with 50% and 90% contours of 362 deg@xmath0 and 1238 deg@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we initiated follow - up observations with decam on 2015 december 28 ut , two days after the gw detection and 10 hours after distribution of the bayestar sky map .",
    "decam is a wide - field optical imager with a 3 deg@xmath0 field of view @xcite .",
    "we imaged a 28.8 deg@xmath0 region corresponding to 3% of the sky localization probability when convolved with the initial bayestar map and 2% of the localization probability in the final lalinference sky map .",
    "the pointings and ordering of the decam observations were determined using the automated algorithm described in soares - santos et al . @xcite .",
    "the choice of observing fields was constrained by weather , instrument availability , and the available time to observe this sky region given its high airmass .",
    "we obtained four epochs of data with each epoch consisting of one 90 s exposure in @xmath1-band and two 90 s exposures in @xmath2-band for each of the 12 pointings .",
    "the first epoch was obtained 23 days after the gw event time ( 2015 december 2829 ut ) , the second epoch was at 6 days ( 2016 january 1 ut ) , the third epoch was at 1314 days ( 2016 january 89 ) , and the fourth epoch was at 2324 days ( 2016 january 1819 ) .",
    "a summary of the observations is provided in table  [ datatable ] and a visual representation of the sky region is shown in figure  [ fig : obs ] .",
    "we processed the data using an implementation of the photpipe pipeline modified for decam images .",
    "photpipe is a pipeline used in several time - domain surveys ( e.g. , supermacho , essence , pan - starrs1 ; see @xcite ) , designed to perform single - epoch image processing including image calibration ( e.g. , bias subtraction , cross - talk corrections , flat - fielding ) , astrometric calibration , image coaddition , and photometric calibration . additionally , photpipe performs difference imaging using hotpants @xcite to compute a spatially varying convolution kernel , followed by photometry on the difference images using an implementation of dophot optimized for point spread function ( psf ) photometry on difference images @xcite .",
    "lastly , we use photpipe to perform initial candidate searches by specifying a required number of spatially coincident detections over a range of time .",
    "once candidates are identified , photpipe performs  forced \" psf photometry on the subtracted images at the fixed coordinates of an identified candidate in each available epoch .    in the case of the gw151226 observations , we began with raw images acquired from the noao archive and the most recent calibration files .",
    "astrometric calibration was performed relative to the pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ) @xmath29 survey and 2mass @xmath30-band catalogs .",
    "the two @xmath2-band exposures were then coadded .",
    "photometric calibration was performed using the ps1 @xmath29 survey with appropriate calibrations between ps1 and decam magnitudes @xcite .",
    "image subtraction was performed using observations from the final epoch as templates .",
    "the approach to candidate selection is described in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",

    "the variability in depth is driven by the high airmass and changes in observing conditions , particularly during the second epoch .",
    "the primary focus of our search is a fast - fading transient .",
    "while the merger of a bbh system is not expected to produce an em counterpart , it is informative to consider the possibility of optical emission due to the presence of some matter in the system . as a generic example",
    ", we consider the behavior of a transient such as a short gamma - ray burst ( sgrb ) with a typical beaming - corrected energy of @xmath33 erg and an opening angle of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "if viewed far off - axis @xmath35 the optical emission will reach peak brightness after several days , but at the distance of gw151226 ( @xmath36 mpc , @xcite ) , the peak brightness will be @xmath37 mag ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) , well beyond our detection limit . if the source is observed moderately off - axis or on - axis @xmath38 , then the light curve will decline throughout our observations , roughly as @xmath39 , and will be detectable at @xmath40 2122 mag in our first observation ( see figures 3 and 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "we can apply a similar argument to the behavior of a more isotropic ( and non - relativistic ) outflow given that any material ejected in a bbh merger is likely to have a low mass and the outflow will thus become optically thin early , leading to fading optical emission . based on this line of reasoning , we search our data for steadily declining transients .",
    "we identify relevant candidates in the data using the following selection criteria with the forced photometry from photpipe . unless otherwise noted these criteria are applied to the @xmath1-band data due to the greater depth in those observations .    1",
    ".   we require non - negative or consistent with zero ( i.e. , within 2@xmath41 of zero ) @xmath1- and @xmath2-band fluxes in the difference photometry across all epochs to eliminate any sources that re - brighten in the fourth ( template ) epoch .",
    "this provides an initial sample of 602 candidates .",
    "we require @xmath42 @xmath1- and @xmath2-band detections in the first epoch and at least one additional @xmath42 @xmath1-band detection in either of the two remaining epochs ( to eliminate contamination from asteroids ) .",
    "this criterion leaves a sample of 98 objects .",
    "we require a @xmath43 decline in flux between the first and third epochs to search for significant fading producing an effectively shallower transient search .",
    "soares - santos et al .",
    "@xcite quantified this effect by injecting fake sources into their observations to determine the recovery efficiency and loss of detection depth from analysis cuts . here",
    ", we forego such analysis to focus the discussion on the effects of contamination in optical follow - up of gw events . ] .",
    "we calculate @xmath41 as the quadrature sum of the flux errors from the first and third epochs ( @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the flux errors from the first and third epochs , respectively ) .",
    "this criterion leaves a sample of 48 objects .",
    "we reject sources that exhibit a significant ( @xmath43 ) rise in flux between the first and second epochs or the second and third epochs to eliminates variable sources that do not decline steadily .",
    "this criterion leaves a sample of 32 objects .",

    "this criterion is designed to remove variable stars and long - timescale transients .",
    "only four events passed our final criterion .",
    "we find that two of those events are coincident with the nuclei of known agn ( pks0129 - 066 and mrk584 ) , indicating that they represent agn variability .",
    "a third candidate is coincident with the nucleus of the bright radio source pmnj0203 + 0956 ( @xmath47 jy , @xcite ) , also suggesting agn variability",
    ".        the final candidate in our search is located at ra = 01@xmath4842@xmath4916@xmath50.17 and dec = @xmath51021342 6  ( j2000 ) , with an offset of @xmath9 arcsec from the galaxy cgcg 386 - 030 ( ra = 01@xmath4842@xmath4915@xmath50.6 , dec = @xmath51021338 5 ; j2000 ) , at @xmath52 or @xmath53 mpc ( 6dfgs , @xcite ) ; see figure  [ fig : ps15cdi ] .",
    "we note that this distance is inconsistent with the 90% confidence interval for the distance to gw151226 based on the gw data @xcite .",
    "we observe this source in a state of rapid decline with an absolute magnitude of @xmath54  mag on 2015 december 28 and @xmath55  mag on 2016 january 1 , indicating a decline rate of @xmath56 mag d@xmath26 ; the decline rate in @xmath2-band is @xmath57 mag d@xmath26 .",
    "additionally , the source exhibits a red @xmath58 color of @xmath59 mag .",
    "we fit these data to a power - law model typical for grb afterglows @xmath60 and find a temporal index of @xmath61 and a spectral index of @xmath62 , both of which differ from the expected values for grb afterglows ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , we compare our observations to a kilonova model with ejecta parameters of @xmath65c and @xmath66 m@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we find that the timescale of the transient agrees with those expected for kilonovae , but the color is bluer than the expected value of @xmath67  mag @xcite .",
    "thus , the properties of this transient differ from those of grb afterglows or kilonovae .",
    "the observations and models are shown in figure  [ fig : ps15cdi ] .",
    "this source was previously detected as ps15cdi on 2015 september 23 by the pan - starrs survey for transients ( psst , @xcite ) ; see figure  [ fig : ps15cdi ] . the absolute @xmath1-band magnitude in the first psst epoch , @xmath68 mag and the shallow decline of @xmath69  mag over @xmath70  d , are consistent with a type iip core - collapse supernova ( sn ) .",
    "a likely interpretation of the rapid decline in our observations is that ps15cdi is a type iip sn undergoing the rapid transition from the hydrogen recombination driven plateau to the radioactive @xmath71co dominated phase @xcite .",
    "the red @xmath58 color in our data is consistent with observations of other iip sn during this phase of evolution ( e.g. , sn2013ej , @xcite ) .",
    "this transition typically occurs about 100  d post explosion @xcite , consistent with the timing of our observations relative to the first detection in psst .    to mitigate the effect of excess flux from ps15cdi still present in our template observations , we repeat the analysis using as templates archival des @xmath1- and @xmath2-band images from 2013 december 19 . these data were processed and image subtraction was performed as described in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "we find that flux from ps15cdi is indeed still present in our original template image , leading to revised first epoch absolute magnitudes of @xmath72 and @xmath73  mag , and a decline rate between the first and fourth epochs of 0.04  mag d@xmath26 , in both @xmath1- and @xmath2-bands .",
    "the transient still exhibits a red @xmath58 colors of @xmath74  mag across all four epochs .    clearly , we can rule out this candidate based on the psst detections prior to gw151226 , but without this crucial information this candidate would have been a credible optical counterpart based on its light curve behavior and distance .",
    "it is therefore useful to develop an understanding of the expected rates for such contaminants to inform expectations in future searches .",
    "we adopt a local core - collapse sn rate of @xmath75  yr@xmath26  mpc@xmath76 @xcite , and a type iip sn fraction of 48% of this rate @xcite .",
    "the rapid decline phase typically lasts about @xmath77  d @xcite , so we consider events that occur within that time frame .",
    "lastly , given its apparent brightness , we assume that ps15cdi represents the approximate maximum distance to which we can observe these events in our data .",
    "we thus find an expected occurrence rate of @xmath78 events in our search area making our detection of ps15cdi somewhat unlikely , and indicating that @xmath79 such events are expected in a typical gw localization region .",
    "our detection of ps15cdi clearly demonstrates the presence and impact of contaminants when conducting optical follow - up of gw events .",
    "core - collapse sne are generally not considered to be a significant contaminant due to their much longer timescales compared to kilonovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a source like ps15cdi , caught in a rapid phase of its evolution despite its overall long timescale , and exhibiting a relatively red color could satisfy a set of criteria designed for finding kilonovae ( @xmath80 mag d@xmath26 and @xmath81 mag ; @xcite ) .    the most effective approach to deal with contaminants like",
    "ps15cdi is rapid , real - time identification .",
    "once a candidate is deemed interesting , optical spectroscopy and nir photometry can quickly distinguish between a sn or kilonova / afterglow origin .",
    "specifically , the kilonova spectrum will be redder , with clear suppression below @xmath82    due to the opacities of @xmath83-process elements @xcite .",
    "by comparison , the sn spectrum will appear bluer and dominated by iron group opacities @xcite , while the afterglow spectrum will exhibit a featureless power - law spectrum @xcite .",
    "if pre - existing templates are not available then the significant aspect is rapid initiation of follow - up observations at @xmath79 d that can distinguish the rising phase of a kilonova or off - axis grb from a declining sn .",
    "we presented the results of our deep optical follow - up of gw151226 using the decam wide - field imager .",
    "our observations cover a sky area of 28.8 deg@xmath0 , corresponding to @xmath84 of the initial bayestar probability map and 2% of the final lalinference map .",
    "we obtained four epochs of observations starting 10 hours after the event was announced and spanning 224 days post trigger , with an average @xmath4 point - source sensitivity of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with an epoch - to - epoch scatter of 0.4 mag , in our difference images .",
    "using the final epoch as a template image , we searched for sources that display a significant and steady decline in brightness throughout our observations , and which are not present in the template epoch .",
    "this search yielded four transients , of which three result from agn variability .",
    "the final event is located at a distance of about 187 mpc offset by @xmath85 from its host galaxy .",
    "it also broadly possesses the observational features of a kilonova in terms of its rapid decline and red @xmath58 color .",
    "however , this source corresponds to the transient ps15cdi , which was discovered in psst about 94 days prior to the gw trigger .",
    "it is a likely type iip supernova , which our observations caught in the steep transition at the end of the plateau phase .",
    "the detection of this event indicates that careful rejection of contaminants , preferably in real time , is essential in order to avoid mis - identifications of optical counterparts to gw sources .",
