    "the equity default swap contract has recently been introduced in the financial markets .",
    "the contract pays a recovery proportion of a notional amount at the time of the occurence of a specific equity event , up to a maturity , that is typically @xmath0 years .",
    "the equity event is defined as the first time the stock price drops below @xmath1 of the price prevailing at contract initiation .",
    "the distribution of this first passage time is then of critical importance in the valuation of the contract .",
    "these distributions are known for the geometric brownian motion model and results have also recently been obtained ( davydov and linetsky ( 2001 ) , campi and sbuelz ( 2005 ) ) for the constant elasticity of variance ( cev ) model .",
    "the prices of european options under these models , however , are not consistent with observed market option prices and such observations call into question the resulting swap prices .    observed market option prices are more closely matched by a variety of pure jump lvy process models for the evolution of the logarithm of the stock price . here",
    "we shall focus attention on the four parameter @xmath2 lvy model introduced by carr , geman , madan and yor ( 2002 ) .",
    "first passage times for such lvy processes require knowledge of the distribution of the supremum and infimum of the process over a fixed time interval .",
    "the product of the laplace transforms of these distributions is known by the famed wiener - hopf factorization .",
    "identification of the law of the infimum and supremum then flounders on the inability to analytically perform the factorization .",
    "again , it is known that if the lvy process has only one - sided jumps , say downwards , then the law of the supremum is known and one may then use the wiener - hopf identity to deduce the law of the infimum .",
    "such strategies have been effectively pursued in rogers ( 2000 ) , novikov , melchers , shinjikashvili and kordzakhia ( 2003 ) , khanna and madan ( 2004 ) and chiu and yin ( 2005 ) .",
    "processes with one sided jumps are dominated by those with two sided jumps in their ability to explain option prices .    for lvy processes with two",
    "sided jumps the double laplace transform in time and the level of the infimum and supremum have been derived by nguyen and yor ( 2002 ) for some lvy processes using bivariate integral representations .",
    "however , the numerical inversion of these transforms involves four integrals and is computationally quite involved .",
    "here we consider an alternative strategy for obtaining the first passage distribution of two sided jump lvy processes . to this end",
    ", we use phase - type distributions , defined as the time until absorption of a finite state continuous - time markov process ( see asmussen ( 1992 ) ) .",
    "it is a well known fact that this class comes close to being complete for obtaining first passage probabilities of the type we consider .",
    "we employ results from asmussen , avram and pistorius ( 2004 ) to obtain closed forms for the laplace transform of first passage distributions for lvy processes when the lvy measure has a phase type distribution .",
    "in addition to providing tractable computational schemes , phase - type distributions have the advantage of forming a dense class so that by increasing the size of the state space , one can in principle get arbitrarily close to a target density and thereby get arbitrarily good approximations of the first passage probabilities .    a particularly important subclass of phase - type distributions is formed by the hyperexponential distributions , i.e. finite mixtures of exponentials .",
    "the underlying markov process then chooses some initial state , stays there an exponential time with rate depending on the state and goes directly to the absorbing state .",
    "this subclass is appealing for the @xmath2 lvy case as the target density is completely monotonic , i.e. a possibly continuous mixture of exponentials , so that by a discretization procedure it is a limit of ( possibly scaled ) hyperexponential densities . in practice",
    ", the fitting can be done either by maximum likelihood ( asmussen , nerman and olsson ( 1996 ) ) as then one wants to capture the shape of the target density , or by minimizing a distance measure paying specific attention to specific features of interest . in particular , in first passage problems a good fit in the tail is crucial , and hyperexponential approximations to pareto tails have been obtained in this way ( feldman and whitt ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "this is the path we follow in this paper .",
    "we approximate the lvy density of the @xmath2 process by a hyperexponential distribution and we then use the first passage time of the approximating  process to determine the laplace transform of the first passage time distribution for the approximating lvy process .",
    "one dimensional laplace transform inversions using the methods of abate and whitt ( 1995 ) then give us both the survival probability and the first passage density for this approximation .",
    "one may wish to evaluate the quality of this approximation to an exact result for the @xmath2 process .",
    "the latter is however not computationally available at this time .",
    "one may obtain alternative approximations by either solving partial integro differential equations or by monte carlo simulation .",
    "the simulation would require the development of appropriate importance sampling methodologies .",
    "we therefore leave these questions for future research .",
    "the same considerations apply with respect to constructing a priori bounds on the error with respect to the exact result .    from the first passage density and survival probability",
    "one may determine the quote on an equity default swap contract .",
    "we estimate the @xmath2 parameters from the prices of options on ford and gm over a three year period and extract daily estimates of quotes on equity default swap contracts using the above hyperexponential approximation .",
    "we compare these prices with market quotes on the @xmath3 rates and we observe that these two separate sets of prices for a credit event , indeed , correlate well .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the details for the construction of the laplace transform of the first passage time for an approximation to the @xmath2 lvy process .",
    "section 3 describes how this transform is used in quoting on equity default swap contracts .",
    "section 4 presents the results of daily calibration of the @xmath2 model to market option prices .",
    "section 5 compares the resulting equity default swap prices with their credit default swap counterparts .",
    "section 6 concludes .",
    "we wish to determine the first passage time of the @xmath2 lvy process to various levels using a phase type distribution to approximate the process . for the laplace transform of the first passage time of the approximating process ,",
    "i.e. a process with a phase type lvy measure , we follow asmussen , avram and pistorius ( 2004 ) .",
    "given that the lvy measure is completely monotone we may employ a very special phase type distribution that approximates the lvy measure as a mixture of exponentials .",
    "the phase type distribution we employ therefore has a simple form . starting from an initial state we have an entrance into a number of states where we stay until absorption .",
    "there are no transitions between states .",
    "suppose the lvy measure has the form @xmath4    our phase type distribution for the positive jumps has @xmath5 states with the generator matrix@xmath6with unnormalized initial state probabilities proportional to @xmath7 for the states @xmath8 and the vector of absorption rates into the final state is @xmath9    the characteristic exponent for the approximation now takes the special form@xmath10   \\notag \\\\ & = & \\mu s+\\lambda _ { + } \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\pi _ { i}^{+}\\left ( \\frac{\\alpha _ { i}}{% \\alpha _ { i}-s}-1\\right ) + \\lambda _ { \\_}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\pi _ { j}^{-}\\left ( \\frac{% \\beta _ { j}}{\\beta _ { j}+s}-1\\right ) + \\frac{\\sigma ^{2}}{2}s^{2 }   \\notag \\\\ \\lambda ^{+ } & = & \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{a_{i}}{\\alpha _ { i}};\\text { } \\lambda _ { \\_}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\frac{b_{j}}{\\beta _ { j } }   \\label{ce } \\\\ \\pi _ { i}^{+ } & = & \\frac{a_{i}}{\\lambda _ { + } \\alpha _ { i}};\\text { } \\pi _ { j}^{-}=% \\frac{b_{j}}{\\lambda _ { \\_}\\beta _ { j}}.   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]where the value of @xmath11 will depend on the diffusion approximation we incorporate for the small jumps .",

    "we next consider the details for the diffusion approximation and the phase type approximation of the @xmath82 process .",

    "the specific values for @xmath86 were obtained using a least squares algorithm that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the left hand side of ( [ fitfn ] ) and the right hand side of ( [ fitfn ] ) evaluated at the @xmath87 points starting at @xmath88 and increasing to @xmath89 in steps of @xmath90 as starting values we employed @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "our application works with the value of @xmath93 fixed at @xmath94 and hence the approximation of equation ( [ fitfn ] ) developed and subsequently used is independent of all parameter variations .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath86 were @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 and @xmath101    we then approximate the @xmath2 lvy density on the two sides by @xmath102    we then have in terms of our general discussion above@xmath103    alternative but somewhat related procedures for fitting hyperexponentials to general densities ( rather than lvy measures as here ) have been considered in feldman and whitt ( 1998 ) , andersen and nielsen ( 1998 ) and asmussen , jobmann and schwefel ( 2002 ) .",
    "for the first passage to a low level we may work with the first passage of @xmath104 to a high level . in this case we reverse the roles of @xmath105 and write @xmath106      above we discussed a procedure to approximate a @xmath2 process @xmath107 by a lvy process @xmath108 with density ( [ lm ] ) and to improve the approximation we would like now to approximate the difference by a brownian motion .",
    "a way to refine the above approximation of @xmath107 by @xmath108 is to approximate the process of small jumps by a brownian motion .",
    "this process of small jumps denoted @xmath109 is obtained using the lvy density of @xmath107 restricted to @xmath110 the process @xmath111 is approximated by a brownian motion with variance@xmath112    in asmussen and rosinski ( 2001 ) it is shown that , if @xmath113 has no atoms , @xmath111 weakly converges to a brownian motion if and only if @xmath114    for a variance gamma process this diffusion approximation fails as    @xmath115    for a @xmath2 process with @xmath116 this diffusion approximation is valid , since@xmath117    ( as @xmath118 in a neighbourhood of the origin , see example 2.3 in asmussen and rosinski ( 2001 ) ) .    in our @xmath2 process approximation we truncated the @xmath2 lvy density at @xmath119 on the one hand but , on the other hand ,",

    "there is a notional amount @xmath127 associated with the receipt side and the actual level of cash flows received is @xmath127 times one minus the recovery rate @xmath128 on the occurence of the equity event .",
    "our calculations employ a recovery rate of @xmath129 these funds are received on the time @xmath130 of first passage of the equity to a level below the specified barrier .",
    "we employ two barriers in our calculations , these are @xmath131 and @xmath1 of the price at initiation .    against this stream of receipts",
    "the equity default swap holder makes periodic coupon payments , typically until the equity event or the maturity whichever is comes first . at the first passage event date we subtract from the receipts the accrued coupons from the last coupon date before @xmath132 to this date .",
    "we denote time measured in days by @xmath39 and in years by @xmath133 for each day @xmath39 we define the function @xmath134 that gives the number of days between the end of day @xmath39 and the last day on which a coupon was paid .",
    "we also denote by @xmath135 the maturity of the contract in days while @xmath136 is the maturity in years . by convention",
    "we take @xmath137 .",
    "let @xmath138 be the first passage event indicator function that takes the value @xmath139 if the first passage of equity has occurred on or before day @xmath140 and is zero otherwise .",

    "the @xmath147 payment @xmath148 occurring on day @xmath146 is then given by @xmath149where the multiplication by the complementary first passage event indicator function recognizes that no coupon payments are made after the first passage event .    for the valuation of claims we employ a discount function @xmath150 that gives the present value of a dollar promised on day @xmath151",
    "there are a variety of approaches to constructing such discount functions",
    ".    the random present value of cash flows to the equity default swap contract , @xmath152 is then given by @xmath153we are supposing here that conditional on the outcome of the first passage event the expected values of future dollars are the same .",
