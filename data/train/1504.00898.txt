    "these include residual - based estimators and the corresponding convergence analysis ( explicit @xcite , and implicit @xcite ) , equilibrated estimators @xcite , and recovery - based estimators @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are four types of errors in the explicit residual - based estimator ( see @xcite ) .",
    "two of them are standard , i.e. , the element residual and the face jump associated with the original equation in .",
    "the other two are also the element residual and the face jump , but associated with the divergence of the original equation : @xmath23 .",
    "the recovery - based estimator studied in @xcite may be viewed as an extension of the popular zienkiewicz - zhu ( zz ) error estimator ( @xcite ) for the poisson equation to the @xmath0 problem with constant coefficients .",
    "more specifically , two quantities related to the solution @xmath12 and @xmath24 are recovered based on the current approximation of the solution in a richer recovery space .",
    "the recovery space in @xcite is the _ continuous _ piecewise polynomial space , and the recovery procedure is done through averaging on vertex patches .",
    "the resulting zz estimator consisting of two terms is shown to be equivalent to the face jumps across the element faces .",
    "the element residuals are not included in the estimator in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop and analyze an efficient , reliable , and robust recovery - based _ a posteriori _ error estimator for the finite element approximation to the @xmath0 interface problem , i.e. , problem   with piecewise constant coefficients .",
    "theoretically , the efficiency refers that the local error indicator is bounded above by the local error , the reliability refers that the global error is bounded above by the global estimator .",
    "the robustness refers that constants in the efficiency and the reliability bounds are independent of the jumps of the coefficients .",
    "the recovered - based estimator introduced in this paper may be viewed as an extension of our previous work in @xcite on the diffusion interface problem to the @xmath0 interface problem , which partially resolve the non - robustness of zz error estimator for interface problems . specifically , we recover two quantities related to @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the respective @xmath0- and @xmath21-conforming finite element spaces ( the lowest order ndlec and brezzi - douglas - marini elements respectively ) . for discussions on which quantities to be recovered and in what finite element spaces ,",
    "see @xcite . the resulting estimator measures the face jumps of the tangential components and the normal component of the numerical approximations to @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "our study indicates that the element residual is no longer higher order than the rest terms in the estimator , the contrary of which is proved to be the case in the diffusion problem ( @xcite ) . as a result , the element residual using recovered quantities is part of our proposed error estimator as well .    theoretically proving a robust reliability bound for",
    "the @xmath0 interface problem is much harder than that for the diffusion interface problem .",
    "this is because one needs to estimate the dual norm of the residual functional over the @xmath0 space . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", one needs to use a helmholtz decomposition of the error ( e.g. see @xcite ) . for the @xmath0 interface problem ,",
    "additional difficulty is that the decomposition has to be stable under a coefficient weighted norm . to obtain such a decomposition",
    "is a non - trivial matter , for the discrete level , a discrete weighted helmholtz decomposition is studied together with its application and analysis for non - overlapping domain decomposition method in @xcite . here for the continuous version , under certain assumptions , we are able to accomplish this task through establishing a weighted identity relating gradient , curl , and divergence of a piecewisely smooth vector field ( see lemma  [ lem : normeqiv ] ) , which is an extension to the technique used in @xcite .",
    "the final decomposition result in our paper is similar to the one in @xcite , the coefficient distribution setting is slightly more general than the one used in @xcite .",
    "our proof uses a piecewise regularity result from @xcite than directly building from extension in @xcite .",
    "another necessary tool for proving a robust reliability bound is a tweaked version of the clment - type interpolation .",
    "we are able to extend naturally from the idea in @xcite for the vertex - based continuous lagrange element to the edge - based ndlec element in three dimensions .",
    "moreover , our quasi - monotone assumption on the distribution of the coefficients is based on edges which is similar to that of @xcite based on vertices in 2d , and our proof borrows the idea from @xcite .",
    "this is the first ndlec interpolation known to achieve such a robust bound .    moving onto the efficiency bound estimate",
    ", we prove the every part of the local recovery - based error estimator can be bounded by the robustly weighted residual - based error estimator . for the local error indicator measuring the irrotational part ( gradient part ) of the error , using the weighted averaging technique ,",
    "the constant in the bounds is independent of the coefficient jumps across the interface .",
    "for the local estimator measuring the jump of the numerical approximation to @xmath25 ( weak solenoidal or curl part of the error ) , the degrees of freedom of the corresponding recovered quantity sits on the edge ( lowest order ndlec elements ) .",
    "consequently , the averaging is performed within an edge patch in 3d , and this resembles the averaging of zienkiewicz - zhu ( zz ) error estimator on vertex patch in 2d .",
    "it is known that , if the averaging is done in vertex patches that span across the interface , zz error estimator ( even correctly weighted ) is not robust with respect to the ratio of the max / min of the coefficients on diffusion interface problem ( e.g. see @xcite ) . here for the @xmath0 interface problem , under the assumption of the quasi - monotone distribution of the coefficients again , we are able to prove that the zz type averaging , if carefully weighted , yields a robust efficiency bound with respect to the coefficient jump .",
    "this is a first known result as well .",
    "numerically , we are able to show that the recovery - based estimator studied in this paper is more accurate than the residual - based estimator in @xcite for several test problems .    this paper is organized as follows . the variational formulation and the @xmath0-conforming finite element approximation",
