    "there are certain scientific problems that provide deep connections between many different scientific fields .",
    "the study of the low - energy states of classical interacting many - particle systems is an exemplar of a class of such problems because of its manifest importance in physics , materials science , communication theory , cryptography , mathematics and computer science .",
    "such many - particle systems have been used with great success to model liquids , glasses and crystals when quantum effects are negligible @xcite .",
    "the total potential energy @xmath3 of @xmath4 identical particles with positions @xmath5 in some large volume in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 can be resolved into separate one - body , two - body , @xmath6 , @xmath4-body contributions : @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the intrinsic @xmath9-body interaction in excess to the interaction energy for @xmath10 particles . to make the statistical - mechanical problem more tractable , the exact many - body potential ( [ full ] )",
    "is usually replaced by a mathematically simpler form .",
    "for example , in the absence of an external field ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) , often one assumes pairwise additivity , i.e. , @xmath12 pairwise additivity is exact for hard - sphere systems and frequently has served to approximate accurately the interactions in simple liquids , such as the well - known lennard - jones pair potential @xcite , and in more complex systems where the pair potential @xmath13 in ( [ pair ] ) can be regarded to be an _ effective _ pair interaction @xcite .",
    "an outstanding problem in classical statistical mechanics is the determination of the _ ground states _ of @xmath3 , which are those configurations that globally minimize @xmath3 and hence are the states that exist at absolute zero temperature .",
    "while classical ground states are readily produced by slowly freezing liquids in experiments and computer simulations , our theoretical understanding of them is far from complete @xcite .",
    "virtually all theoretical / computational ground - state studies of many - particle systems have been conducted for pairwise additive potentials @xcite .",
    "often the ground states of short - range pairwise interactions are crystal structures in low dimensions @xcite , but long - range interactions exist that can suppress any kind of symmetry leading to disordered ground states in low dimensions @xcite .",
    "moreover , in sufficiently high dimensions , it has been suggested that even short - ranged pairwise interactions possess disordered ground states @xcite .",
    "ground states of purely repulsive pair interactions have profound connections not only to low - temperature states of matter but to problems in pure mathematics , including discrete geometry and number theory @xcite , information theory , and computer science .",
    "as will be explained further below , it is known that the sphere packing problem and the number variance problem ( closely related to an optimization problem in number theory ) can be posed as energy minimizations associated with an infinite number of point particles in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 interacting via certain repulsive pair potentials .",
    "both of these problems can be interpreted to be optimization problems involving _ point processes _ , which can then be recast as energy minimizations .",
    "a point process in @xmath1 is a distribution of an an infinite number of points in @xmath1 at number density @xmath14 ( number of points per unit volume ) with configuration @xmath15 ; see ref .",

    "a packing of congruent nonoverlapping spheres is a special point process in which there is a minimal pair separation distance , equal to the sphere diameter .",
    "the sphere packing problem seeks to determine the densest arrangement(s ) of congruent , nonoverlapping @xmath0-dimensional spheres in euclidean space @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "although it is simple to state , it is a notoriously difficult problem to solve rigorously .",
    "indeed , kepler s four - century - old conjecture , which states that the face - centered - cubic lattice in @xmath16 is maximally dense , was only recently proved @xcite . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the packing problem remains unsolved @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the sphere packing problem can be posed as an energy minimization problem involving pairwise interactions between points in @xmath1 ( e.g. , inverse power - law functions in which the exponent tends to infinity ) ; see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "problems concerning the properties and quantification of density fluctuations in many - particle systems continue to provide many theoretical challenges .",
    "of particular interest are density fluctuations that occur on some local length scale @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the minimal number variance associated with points ( e.g. , centroids of atomic or molecular systems ) contained within some  window \" can also be formulated as a ground - state problem involving bounded repulsive pair interactions with compact support @xcite . for spherical windows in the large - radius limit , the best known solutions in @xmath1 are usually point configurations that are  duals \" ( in the sense discussed later in the paper ) to the best known sphere packings in @xmath1 .",
    "the focus of this paper is on two other optimization problems involving point processes in @xmath1 : the _ covering _ and _ quantizer _ problems . roughly speaking",
    ", the covering problem asks for the point configuration that minimizes the radius of overlapping spheres circumscribed around each of the points required to cover @xmath1 .",
    "the covering problem has applications in wireless communication network layouts @xcite , the search of high - dimensional data parameter spaces ( e.g. , search templates for gravitational waves ) @xcite , and stereotactic radiation therapy @xcite .",
    "the quantizer problem is concerned with finding the point configuration in @xmath1 that minimizes a  distance error \" associated with a randomly placed point and the nearest point of the point process .",
    "it has applications in computer science ( e.g. , data compression ) @xcite , digital communications @xcite , coding and cryptography @xcite , and optimal meshing of space for numerical applications ( e.g. , quadrature and discretizing partial differential equations ) @xcite .",
    "heretofore , the covering and quantizers problems were not known to correspond to any ground - state problems .",
    "we reformulate the covering and quantizer problems as the determination of the ground states of interacting particles in @xmath1 that generally involve single - body , two - body , three - body , and higher - body interactions .",
    "this is done by linking the covering and quantizer problems to certain optimization problems involving the  void \" nearest - neighbor functions that arise in the theory of random media and statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "these reformulations , which again exemplifies the deep interplay between geometry and physics , enable one to employ theoretical and numerical optimization techniques to solve these energy minimization problems .",
    "we find that disordered _ saturated _ sphere packings ( roughly , packings in which no space exists to add an additional sphere ) provide relatively thin ( i.e. , economical ) coverings and may yield thinner coverings than the best known lattice coverings in sufficiently large dimensions . in the case of the quantizer problem , we derive improved upper bounds on the quantizer error that utilize sphere - packing solutions .",
    "these improved bounds are generally substantially sharper than an existing upper bound in low to moderately large dimensions .",
    "we also demonstrate that disordered saturated sphere packings yield relatively good quantizers .",
    "our reformulation helps to explain why the known solutions of quantizer and covering problems are identical in the first three space dimensions and why they can be different for @xmath2 . in the first three space dimensions , the best known solutions of the sphere packing and number variance problems are directly related to those of the covering and quantizer problems , but such relationships may or may not exist for @xmath2 , depending on the peculiarities of the dimensions involved .",
