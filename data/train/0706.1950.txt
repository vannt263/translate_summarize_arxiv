    "in organic field effect transistors ( fets ) , charges move in a conducting layer located at the interface between an organic crystal and a gate insulator .",
    "commonly used gate insulators such as sio@xmath0 or al@xmath0o@xmath1 are polar materials .",
    "when an electron moves in the vicinity of such materials , it induces a long - range polarization that modifies its physical properties , forming a _ polaron_. this mechanism is well known in inorganic semiconductor heterostructures such as gaas / alas.@xcite there , however , due to the weak polarizabilities and to the extremely low band masses , the polar coupling only causes a small renormalization of the electronic properties .    in organic fets",
    ", there are two important differences that can eventually lead to much more dramatic effects .",
    "the first is that organic crystals have very narrow bandwidths , due to the weak van der waals bonding between the molecules .",
    "the second is that one can use gate insulators where the static ( @xmath2 ) and high frequency ( @xmath3 ) dielectric constants have a large difference in magnitude , i.e. that are much more polarizable than gaas .",
    "indeed , recent experiments performed on rubrene single crystal fets have shown that the charge carrier mobility at room temperature decreases upon increasing the dielectric constant of the gate material.@xcite at the same time , the temperature dependence of the mobility evolves from a metallic - like to an insulating - like behavior , @xcite which gives strong support to the relevance of polaron formation .    in this work we present a theoretical framework that consistently explains the observed experimental behavior . the model which describes the interaction of the charge carriers with the ionic polarization at the interface , as well as the basic results concerning the formation of small polarons ,",
    "are presented in section 2 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the polaronic hopping mobility is calculated in section 3 , where we briefly discuss the experimental results of ref .",
    "the possible relevance of the long - range coulomb repulsion between the carriers at sufficiently high concentrations is discussed theoretically in section 4 .",
    "the interaction between the carriers and the polar interface is described by the following frhlich hamiltonian @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are respectively the creation and annihilation operators for carriers , whose dispersion is @xmath9 , and for optical phonons of frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the electron - phonon matrix element is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lattice spacing in the organic crystal , @xmath13 is the total surface and @xmath14 is the mean distance between the carriers and the interface .",
    "the strength of the electron - phonon coupling is controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 which is a combination of the dielectric constant of the organic crystal ( @xmath16 ) and those of the gate material .",
    "the above matrix element was derived in the long - wavelength limit . a cut - off at short distances ( at @xmath17 )",
    "is needed in principle to account for the discrete nature of the molecular crystal .",
    "@xcite however , the finite distance @xmath14 already acts as a short - distance cut - off : @xmath18 is exponentially reduced at the brillouin zone boundaries for @xmath19 , in which case we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : mq ] ) for all practical purposes .",
    "a prescription to deal with discrete lattice effects for @xmath20 is proposed in the appendix .    due the interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) , the electrons get `` dressed '' by the ionic polarization of the gate material . if the interaction is sufficiently strong , the carriers become self - trapped on individual ( or few ) organic molecules , forming _ small polarons _ , and hopping - like transport can set in .",
    "the polaron energy in the strong coupling regime is given by @xmath21.@xcite integrating this expression over the whole reciprocal space leads to the simple result @xmath22 the polaron energy turns out to be independent on the phonon frequency @xmath10 , and therefore depends on the particular gate dielectric only through the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noted that the exponential decay of the matrix element @xmath18 does not imply an analogous decay of the polaron energy with distance , but rather yields a @xmath24 behaviour as can be seen from the above result .",
    "the condition for the formation of a small polaron roughly corresponds to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the nearest - neighbor transfer integral . according to the result eq .",
    "( [ eq : ep ] ) , taking @xmath27 as representative for organic crystals and assuming a typical value @xmath28 ( @xmath29 in rubrene ) , we see that the formation of small polarons is expected as soon as @xmath30 .",

    "( [ eq : mob ] ) .",
    "the values of the activation barrier @xmath39 extracted from the fits are reported in the right panel . despite the rather limited experimental temperature range , @xmath39 is a linear function of @xmath23 for the devices with the strongest polarizabilities ( sio@xmath0 , al@xmath0o@xmath1 , ta@xmath0o@xmath51 ) , as expected from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ep ] ) and ( [ eq : act ] ) .",
    "furthermore , from the slope of @xmath39 vs @xmath23 , a typical distance @xmath52 between the carriers and the interface can be estimated , which is comparable with the lateral size of a rubrene molecule .",

    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) ] was not considered in ref.@xcite , which led to a higher estimate for this distance ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "having established that the electron - phonon interactions can be tuned by changing the polarizability of the gate material , we now investigate the possibility of controlling the coulomb interactions between electrons .",
    "it is clear that these are negligible at low carrier concentrations , i.e. in the linear regime of the @xmath55 vs. @xmath56 curves , where the conducticity is directly proportional to the carrier density ( see e.g. fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    however , especially in the devices with strongly polarizable gate dielectrics , a sizable carrier density can in principle be induced at the highest attainable gate voltages .",
    "for example , in a device with a ta@xmath0o@xmath51 layer of thickness @xmath57 , a concentration @xmath58 holes per rubrene molecule can be reached at @xmath59 . at such density ,",
    "the effects of the electrostatic repulsion between the carriers can not be neglected _ a priori_. here we propose a simple theoretical framework to describe their possible consequences on the device performances .",
    "let us start by observing that the coulomb interaction between two electrons in proximity to a polarizable dielectric is screened by the image charges as @xmath60.\\ ] ] in the following we shall assume that the average interelectron distance is larger than the distance @xmath14 between the electrons and the interface , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : image ] ) can be replaced by its asymptotic expression @xmath61 .    in a system of @xmath62 interacting electrons ,",
    "each charge feels instantaneously the sum of the repulsive potentials of the others .",
    "dynamical screening is unlikely in the regime under study , where the motion of the charge carriers is hindered by the formation of small polarons .",
    "for the same reason , if we focus on a given particle while it hops to its neighboring site , the relaxation of the remaining electrons can be neglected to a first approximation : the collective rearrangement of @xmath63 charges necessarily implies several hopping processes , and therefore occurs on a much longer time scale than the individual hopping event under consideration .    from the above arguments ,",
    "if the interacting fluid is initially at ( or sufficiently close to ) equilibrium , it can be expected that moving a given particle from a site to its nearest neighbor will have a net energy cost @xmath64 , that adds to the polaronic hopping barrier @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , such an energy cost can be easily included in the two - site model presented in the preceding section .",
    "it leads to an increased value of the activation barrier @xmath65 , which eventually reduces the carrier mobility compared to the result eq .",
    "( [ eq : mob ] ) for independent polarons .. more generally , the activation barrier in a biased double - well potential is given by @xmath66 . ] the mobility in the presence of electron - electron interactions can thus be expressed as : @xmath67    to get an order of magnitude estimate of this effect , we replace the actual ( uniform ) distribution of polarons by a triangular array of point charges at the same density .",
    "this approximation is expected to be qualitatively correct for the following reasons : first of all , it is known@xcite that the local correlations in an interacting charged liquid are very similar to the ones of a crystallized state . on the other hand , due to the long - range nature of the interaction potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : image ] ) , the result for @xmath64 should depend only weakly on the details of the charge distribution .",
    "finally , the proposed lattice approximation enforces in a simple way the absence of relaxation of the electron fluid mentioned above .",
    "the potential energy of a given particle in a lattice can be expanded for small displacements @xmath68 around its equilibrium position as : @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the radius of the wigner - seitz disk @xmath71 , which is proportional to the average electron - electron distance , and @xmath72 is a geometrical factor characterizing the triangular lattice . in the present approximation ,",
    "the additional energy cost for hopping between molecules induced by the electrostatic repulsion between the carriers is simply given by @xmath73 .",
    "defining the carrier concentration according to @xmath74 leads to @xmath75 in the case of ta@xmath0o@xmath51 . for @xmath76 , we obtain a value @xmath77 that is consistently smaller than the polaronic barrier @xmath78 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mobv ] ) the coulomb interactions between the carriers can reduce the mobility by @xmath79 at room temperature , and even more at lower temperature .",
    "such behavior should be clearly visible as a bending down in the @xmath55 vs @xmath56 curves at the highest attainable values of the gate voltage .",
    "can modify the charge distribution along @xmath14 , therefore modifying the value of the activation barrier according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ep ] ) , ( [ eq : act ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "@xcite this effect , however , should not play a dominant role if the polarons are already `` small '' . ]",
    "@xcite    note that the concentration that can be reached at a given voltage is proportional to the dielectric constant @xmath2 . as a result , for devices of equal thickness , the maximum value of @xmath64 increases with @xmath2 as @xmath80 .",
    "the observation of coulomb interaction effects is therefore more likely in fets with highly polarizable gate materials .",
    "in this paper we have reviewed a model which describes the interaction of the charge carriers with the interface phonons in single crystal organic fets .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the electron - phonon interaction can be tuned by changing the dielectric polarizability of the gate material .",
    "this model consistently explains the evolution of the carrier mobility from a metallic - like to an insulating - like behavior that has been recently observed in refs .",
    "@xcite : increasing the dielectric polarizability of the gate insulator results in a crossover from the weak to the strong coupling regime where the carriers form small polarons , which gives rise to a thermally activated mobility . building on this model",
    ", the possibility of revealing experimentally the effects of the long range coulomb repulsion between the carriers at high concentrations has been analyzed .    in conclusion , although the main interest in organic fets comes from their potential applications in `` plastic electronics '' , the opportunity of tuning several parameters such as the carrier density , the electron - phonon and possibly the electron - electron interactions , makes them an ideal playground for fundamental physics .",
    "any linear electron - phonon interaction of the form of eq . ( [ eq : model ] ) can be transformed to real space as @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 being the lattice sites . a simple prescription to define a _",
    "discrete _ version of the frhlich model , appropriate on a lattice , is to introduce a short - range cut - off of the order of the lattice spacing , which defines a new potential @xmath84 .",
    "the correct periodicity of the matrix element on the brillouin zone can then be restored by setting @xmath85 it is clear that the new matrix element obeys @xmath86 with @xmath87 any reciprocal lattice vector , which is not the case for @xmath18 of eq .",

    "_ frhlich interaction in 3d . _",
    "the essence of the frhlich model is the interaction of a charge ( monopole ) with a field of dipoles in an ionic material ( + and - ions ) .",
    "correspondingly , the usual polar electron - phonon interaction in 3 dimensions , @xmath90 , scales in real space as @xmath91 , namely @xmath92 the simplest way to introduce a lattice cut - off is to flatten off the potential at short range by setting @xmath93 .",
    "alternatively , one can define @xmath94 with @xmath95 of the order of the lattice spacing @xmath12 .",
    "transforming back @xmath96 to reciprocal space leads to the familiar yukawa form .    a physically sound choice for the cutoff length @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3dcut ] ) is to set @xmath42 equal to the energy of self - interaction of a uniform charge distributed on a cube of side @xmath12,@xcite which yields @xmath97 .",
    "however , the polarizability of the medium at short distances is certainly less than what is predicted by continuum theory , so that the above estimate should be considered as a lower bound for @xmath95 .",
    "note that the potential eq .",
    "( [ eq:3dcut ] ) looks essentially similar to the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the interaction with the apical oxygens in the superconducting cuprates , except for the different decay at long distances , reflecting a different physical origin of the interaction ( in that case , @xmath98 ) . as for the short distance cut - off , the authors of ref .",
