    "measurements of masses , total widths and transition rates of heavy quark bound states serve as important benchmarks for the predictions of qcd - inspired potential models , non - relativistic qcd , lattice qcd and qcd sum rules@xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 mesons are bound states of @xmath8 quarks .",
    "the system is approximately non - relativistic due to the large @xmath9 quark mass , and therefore the quark - antiquark qcd potential can be investigated via @xmath10 spectroscopy .",
    "these mesons are intermediate states between @xmath11 to @xmath12 with the processes @xmath13 and decay to ground state @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 state is spin - singlet p - wave bound state of @xmath16 quarks which was observed for the first time by belle collaboration with significance of @xmath17@xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured that this meson often decays into an intermediate two - body states of @xmath18 mesons , then undergoes final state interactions .",
    "this meson ( @xmath19 ) is used to study of the p - wave spin - spin ( or hyperfine ) interaction .",
    "therefore , theoretical calculations on the physical parameters of this meson and their comparison with experimental data should give valuable information as regards the nature of hyperfine interaction .",
    "however , most of the theoretical studies deal with the non - perturbative qcd calculations . the mass and leptonic decay constant of @xmath19 mesons have been calculated @xcite .",
    "these physical parameters help us to calculate the other physical parameters , i.e. , the rates of various decay modes and coupling constants .    in this work ,",
    "we evaluate the strong coupling constant , @xmath20 within the framework of three - point qcd sum rules .",
    "we consider contributions of both @xmath6 and @xmath5 mesons as off - shell states .",
    "the contributions of the bare loop diagram and the two - gluon condensate diagrams as radiative corrections are evaluated .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is on - shell , that may decay to the intermediate @xmath6 and @xmath5 mesons . in this regard ,",
    "the coupling constants help us to describe the intermediate state of two - body decay of meson into b@xmath2 and b@xmath21 mesons when one of these mesons is off - shell .",
    "the intermediate states decay into the final states with the exchange of virtual mesons .",
    "indeed , without understanding the mechanism of intermediate states , we are not able to analyze the results of ongoing experiments properly .    here",
    ", we use the same technique for the study of the couplings such as @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 , @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath30@xcite and @xmath31vertex from qcd sum rule@xcite , @xmath32@xcite , @xmath33@xcite , @xmath34@xcite .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the qcd sum rules technique where analytical expressions of the @xmath35 strong coupling constant are obtained .",

    "in this section , we present qcd sum rules calculation for the form factor of the @xmath36 vertex . the three - point correlation function associated with the @xmath37 vertex",
    "is given by @xmath38 where , the @xmath5is off - shell state , and : @xmath39 where the @xmath6 is off - shell state , @xmath40 is transferred momentum , and @xmath41 is the time ordering operator .    we describe each meson field in terms of the quark field operators as follows : @xmath42 the above correlation functions need to be calculated in two different ways : on the theoretical side , they are evaluated with the help of the operator - product expansion ( ope ) , where the short and large - distance effects are separated ; on the phenomenological side , they are calculated in terms of hadronic parameters such as masses , leptonic decay constants , and form factors .",

    "we compare the coefficient of the @xmath59 structure for further calculation from different approaches of the correlation functions .",
    "also , a similar expression of the physical side of the correlation function for @xmath5off - shell meson is the following :    @xmath60    in the following , we calculate the correlation functions on the qcd side using the deep euclidean space ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) .",

    "these integrals can be calculated by flipping to euclidean space  time and using schwinger representation for the euclidean propagator    [ e7324 ] = _ 0^d ^n-1 e^-(k^2+m^2 )  ,    the borel transformation is as follows :    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is borel parameter .",
    "we integrate over loop momentum and two parameters that we have used in the exponential representation of propagators @xcite .",
    "we also apply double borel transformations over @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the results after the borel transformations are as follows :    [ e7326 ] ( a , b , c ) & = & i ( m_1 ^ 2)^2-a - b ( m_2",

    "the circumflex of @xmath90 in the equations is used for the result of integrals after the double borel transformation .",
    "after lengthy calculations , the following expressions for the two - gluon condensate contributions are obtained :    @xmath91    @xmath92    after applying the borel transformation to both physical and theoretical sides , we equate the coefficients of the @xmath93 structure from both sides(physical and qcd sides ) .",
    "the results related to the sum rules for the corresponding form factors are found to be :    @xmath94e^{\\frac{-s}{m^2}}e^{\\frac{-s^{\\prime } } { { m^{\\prime}}^2}}+\\pi^{i}_{nonper}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where ; @xmath64 and @xmath95 are either @xmath96 or @xmath71 , where ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "in this study , we calculate the form factor with both the @xmath98 and pole masses .",
    "the values given in the review of particle physics are @xmath99gev and @xmath100gev@xcite , which correspond to the pole masses @xmath101gev and @xmath102gev@xcite . a summary of the other input parameters are given in table i.        the sum rules contain auxiliary parameters , namely borel mass parameters @xmath115 and continuum threshold ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) .",
    "the standard criterion in qcd sum rules is that the physical quantities are independent of the auxiliary parameters .",
    "therefore , we search for the intervals of these parameters so that our results are almost insensitive to their variations .",
    "one more condition for the intervals of the borel mass parameters is the fact that the aforementioned intervals must suppress the higher states , continuum and contributions of the highest - order operators . in other words , the sum rules for the form factors must converge . as a result , we get @xmath118and @xmath119 for both @xmath120 and @xmath6off - shell associated with the @xmath121 vertex .",
    "we depict the dependence of strong coupling constants on borel parameters for @xmath6 off - shell in figs . 3 and 4 )",
    "these figures indicate the weak dependence of form factor of @xmath6 off - shell in terms of the borel mass parameters in the chosen intervals .",
    "we find stable behavior of coupling constant in terms of the borel mass parameters for the @xmath5 off - shell case and we find it unnecessary to show the other figures .    the continuum thresholds @xmath116 and @xmath117 are not arbitrary , but correlated to the energy of the first excited state with the same quantum number as the interpolating current .",
    "thus , we choose the following regions for the continuum thresholds in @xmath116 and @xmath117 channels :            as a final remark , we should say that we follow the standard procedure in the qcd sum rules where the continuum thresholds are supposed to be independent of the borel mass parameters and of @xmath124 .",
