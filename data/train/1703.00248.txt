    "the physics of glass - forming liquids , especially at higher temperature , continues to generate considerable research effort .",
    "these substances of extraordinary practical and technological importance still present considerable scientific challenges in the description of the glass - formation mechanism ( nature of the glass transformation ) and of the nature of the atomic structure at intermediate- and long - range length scales that characterize the solid .",
    "standard x - ray and other scattering techniques fail in this respect to give a conclusive answer about the atomic structure of topologically disordered solids and the development of new investigation tools is desirable since there is no way to distinguish via scattering the structure of the liquid from that of the topologically disordered solid except through the vastly different relaxation time scales .",
    "opinions as to why divergent time scales characterize the formation of the topologically disordered solid differ , however , and no agreement on a justification from structure for the mechanical properties below the glass transformation temperature @xmath0 has to date been reached",
    ". why should indeed a microscopically liquid - looking assembly of interacting particles behave ( mechanically ) like a crystalline solid remains to date a true mystery .",
    "owing to such difficulties much theoretical and computational research on the description of the topologically disordered solid and its properties takes its moves from the study of the corresponding liquid for which much has been understood thanks to equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "though understandable , this approach would correspond to be wanting to understand the physical properties of a crystalline solid from the study of its melt , which of course would present some formidable challenges given the ergodicity - breaking phenomenon that characterizes crystallization . in this essay",
    "it is proposed that the glass transition is of a purely kinetic nature and the use of equilibrium statistical mechanics is at its very limit of applicability since ergodicy also gets broken , though perhaps not so sharply and completely as for crystals , through the onset of the glassy state .",
    "the idea is then to try to learn something about the structure below @xmath0 and the kinetic character of the glass transition starting from the phenomenology of the better understood supercooled liquid state ( defined for temperatures @xmath1 in the range @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the ( equilibrium ) crystallization temperature ) and folding that knowledge in the study of the low - temperatures properties of laboratory amorphous solids .",
    "the return to low - temperatures is for glasses in a sense akin to starting to study the crystalline solid through x - ray and other ( e.g. neutron- ) scattering techniques at `` zero '' temperatures assuming the atoms in fixed positions .",
    "however since at those temperatures the glass would look like a liquid in a static scattering experiment , one has to exploit other specific degrees of freedom of the cold , topologically disordered solid that are not present for the perfectly ordered crystals .",
    "these are the so - called tunneling systems ( tss ) , local defects described in terms of new local degrees of freedom and that can be exploited  much as the atomic nuclei in nmr research  to probe the atomic structure and properties of the glassy state .",
    "the only difficulty is that these ts probes are not entirely localized , each comprising several atoms as a rule , and have not been fully understood to date .",
    "however , progress in their characterization and in the understanding of their microscopic nature is advancing also in view of some recent challenges posed by the discovery of puzzling magnetic effects in non - magnetic glasses that can not be attributed ( despite some interesting attempts ) to trace paramagnetic impurities . moreover , in the strategic research for reliable solid - state qubits to be deployed for the fabrication of working quantum computers ( e.g. through use of josephson - junction superconducting devices ) the problems posed by the tss ( ubiquitous in the junctions ) are paramount .",
    "these new challenges foster enhanced research efforts that have culminated in the development of an extended tunneling model @xcite that relies on a new scenario for the intermediate - range atomic structure of glasses .",
    "the new model and structural scenario afford a reasonable - though not complete - explanation for the low-@xmath1 anomalies in glasses and in turns the structural scenario can be evolved at higher temperatures to formulate a possible mechanism for the onset of the glass transition from the supercooled state .",
    "preliminary aspects of the structure that is expected are tested in this essay and seem to corroborate some known facts about the glassy state . in this new framework of ideas ,",
    "research in the previously - exotic low-@xmath1 regime begins to give very useful hints about the onset of the glassy state from the supercooled liquid at much higher temperatures .",
    "the interplay of knowledge coming from the high-@xmath1 supercooled liquid state and from the low-@xmath1 cryogenic properties thus begins to provide a productive symbiosis for the understanding of this still mysterious , though ubiquitous , state of matter .    at low temperatures ( cryogenic ) glasses",
    "are believed to be characterized by special low - energy excitations ( tss ) which are usually described through the use of double - welled potentials ( dwps ) and of so - called two - level systems ( 2lss ) with energy asymmetry and tunneling barrier broadly distributed throughout the mass of the amorphous solid @xcite . while little is still known about the character ( atomic , polyatomic or cluster - like ) of the tss ,",
    "the general agreement is still that the intermediate - range atomic structure of glasses should be conveniently well described by zachariasen s 1932 continuous random network ( crn ) model @xcite ( thus homogeneously disordered , just like for a liquid ) and the 2lss therefore result out of two slightly similar , probably localized atomic configurations . with this by now classic characterization , the 2lss have been employed mainly in the 1970s and 80s to explain with some success the anomalies in the physicsl properties of glasses at low and ultra - low temperatures , a research field thus far completely detached from the quest for the nature of the glass transition .    yet , systematic deviations from the behaviour predicted by the standard tunneling model ( stm ) occasionally challenge ( or have challenged ) the validity of the model in the case of multi - component glasses with tunable content of the good crystal - forming ( gcf ) component ( e.g. ( sio@xmath4)@xmath5(k@xmath4o)@xmath5 with changing @xmath6 , the concentration of the alkali component , @xcite ) and especially in glasses of the compositions type bao - al@xmath4o@xmath7-sio@xmath4 and then in the presence of a weak magnetic field @xcite . in such glasses ( unfortunately the mixed alkali - silicate glasses have not yet been investigated in a field , but the prediction is important magnetic effects there , and @xmath6-dependent also ) a puzzling non - monotonous magnetic - field dependence in many properties has been unveiled in some physical properties @xcite .",
    "the magnetic effect is typically ( but not always ) weak , but orders of magnitude larger than expected from basic thermodynamic - science considerations .",
    "the stm by itself is unable to account for the compositional and magnetic effects , therefore a suitable extension of the celebrated tunneling model for both situations has been proposed by the present author @xcite .",
    "this so - called extended tunneling model ( etm ) rests upon the existence ( particularly in the multi - component glasses ) of small regions of enhanced regularity ( rers ) in the intermediate - range atomic structure of the somewhat incompletely - frozen ( in fact ) amorphous solid .",
    "a complete mathematical description and intimate physical justification of the etm thus requires at the very least a partial ( or complete ) demise of the zachariasen - warren s vision of the intermediate - scale structure of glasses and amorphous solids in general .",
    "as it happens , an alternative to the homogeneously - disordered approach of zachariasen - warren has been proposed and developed in the former soviet union and in some places in the west .",
    "well before zachariasen - warren , lebedev @xcite and his followers in skt .",
    "petersburg ( but randall in london , uk , too @xcite ) proposed that glasses should be made up of ( initially , true ) polycrystallites of sufficiently small size as to justify the x - ray peak rounding which was observed experimentally in diffractometers .",
    "since the thermal and mechanical properties of glasses are reported not the same as those of polycrystalline solids , the concept of `` crystallite '' has evolved , meaning finally a failed micro - crystal of some sort . also because finite clusters can not be crystalline , strictly speaking .",
    "the evolution of the crystallite concept can be found in reviews by porai - koshits ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and the latest views rely on concepts such as `` cybotactic groupings '' , meaning atomic regions that can be rather extended and interpenetrating , but where the atomic ordering - though not complete due to finite size , thus highly defective - is better achieved than in the rest of the solid .",
    "a recent overview can be found in the works by wright @xcite , and in the russian literature recent ideas have been put forward also by bakai @xcite .",
    "the latter author envisages in fact better - ordered clusters being preferentially nucleated below @xmath3 through some kinetic mecanisms that have the clusters survive and grow at the expense of true micro - crystalline nuclei that have no time to grow . at the glass transition these",
    "ill - formed , but better - ordered clusters merge together and get to form a polycluster that is the macroscopic skeleton of the solid glass .",
    "evidently , looser material is also present in a patchwork atomic structure , characterized by spatial and ( above @xmath0 ) temporal heterogeneities .    in this review",
    "we provide a scenario for the intermediate - range atomic structure of glasses , the cellular model , which is very much reminiscent of the polycluster theory of bakai and a formulation within which the phenomenological assumptions for the etm s mathematical framework ( given in several papers by the present author ) become completely - or at least to a large extent - justified .",
    "the cellular or polycluster model provides for a definitely more realistic mathematical formulation of this framework in terms of a tetrahedric four - welled tunneling quasi - particle potential , as said , the simplified triangular three - welled version of which is nothing but a poor - man s , probably rather realistic , version affording a much speedier mathematical description . within this cellular approch to the structure of glasses the most significant local tunneling potentials ( probably in terms of number density ) turn out to be the dwps , this for a single ( or very few ) atomic particle(s ) , and the said tetrahedric four - welled potential ( tfwp ) for a correlated cluster of @xmath8 charged real atomic particles .",
    "a reasonable and very useful simplification for the tfwp is thus the replacement of the @xmath9 interacting and tunneling atomic particles with a single fictive quasi - particle subject to a triangular tunneling potential ( twp ) and carrying renormalized parameters ( charge , magnetic threaded area , energy asymmetry as well as tunneling probability ) , quantum - mechanically moving about one face of the full tetrahedric potential .",
    "the renormalization gets fully justified by the proximity of ( on average ) four similarly quasi - ordered , close - packed atomic cells ( rers or better - ordered regions ) and the reasonable assumption that most of the charged particles will avoid the interstice s tetrahedral potential s centre .",
    "we present again , therefore , a brief mathematical description of the twp and its quantum mechanics in those limits appropriate for practical applications .",
    "we then show the main results obtained for the description of the density of states ( dos ) and the temperature and magnetic - field dependence for the specific heat of some specific glasses , then for the dielectric constant ( real and imaginary parts ) in the linear - response regime , and for the polarization echo - always in the presence of a magnetic field ( limiting to results obtained for the multi - silicates ) .    with this scenario of the cellular , or polycluster structure of real glasses assimilated",
    ", the question of the description of the glass transition is one of the next challenges .",
    "having nucleation theory , and for better - ordered or bakai clusters in mind the growth of such clusters with a cooling rate @xmath10 can be considered and the temperature at which the polycluster appears is taken to be @xmath0 . with some phenomenological assumptions in the light of standard adam - gibbs theory ( where the rers , or wright s better - ordered clusters , appear as crcs or coherently - rearranging clusters ) @xcite , the dependence of @xmath0 from @xmath10 is worked out and the known logarithmic dependence can be recovered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the cellular model for the structure of glasses , now a complete departure from zachariasen s continuous random - network model , and then examine the likely tunneling states that would emerge from such cellular picture , to conclude that only dwps and tfwps should be relevant for the physics of glasses below the glass transition temperature @xmath0 . in section 2 we also review the basic relevant quantum mechanics of the three - welled , poor man s version of the tfwp , a version that has been used to date to obtain a reasonable single explanation for all of the anomalies ( and deviations from the stm predictions ) due to composition changes and to the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we also show how to evaluate the magnetic density of states ( dos ) @xmath11 and , in section 3 , we briefly review some of the magnetic - field dependent low - temperature physical properties that have been studied to date , such as the heat capacity @xmath12 comparing with some of the published data for the multi - silicate glasses .",
    "we then do the same for the dielectric constant , real part @xmath13 and ( just comment on the ) imaginary part @xmath14 as well , also showing some comparison with available data at low ( khz ) frequency , and then we examine the application of the etm to the explanation of some of the data for the polarization ( or , electric ) echoes in the silicates ( only commenting about glycerol , for which case the etm has been able to explain the so - called isotope effect , which is in fact a mere mass substitution effect ) .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion on how the cellular model can be implemented to gain information on the size of the better - ordered cells making up the polycluster structure of amorphous solids .",
    "the typical values for the cell size extracted from low - temperature experiment parameters are then compared with available high resolution electron microscopy ( hrem ) imaging of insulating glasses that show such structure .",
    "it is shown that estimates from low temperatures and from hrem imaging compare reasonably well . a brief derivation of the model s prediction for the cooling rate dependence of @xmath0 is also provided and this section 4 contains also our conclusions .",
    "glass - forming liquids are an important class of materials for technology and ubiquitous applications , nevertheless the atomistic structure of glass in relation to its physical properties remains a mystery .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the widespread conception is that the atomic arrangement of a glass should be the same as that for a liquid , as is indeed implicit in zachariasen s 1932 proposed continuous network picture @xcite , which has been widely adopted by scholars ( at least in the west , see below ) .",
    "this picture differs from that of a liquid only in that a dynamical arrest has occurred , without specifying its ultimate origin .",
    "relaxation times diverge `` near '' @xmath0 , but why ? in a spin - glass the ultimate origin of dynamical arrest is magnetic frustration ( with or without disorder ) , but for ordinary structural glasses it remains mysterious and an important open issue @xcite . in the opinion of the present author , lack of justification for this arrest is the primary roadblock for the achievement of a theory of the glassy state encompassing all aspects of glass physics in every possible temperature range . as mentioned in the introduction , prior to zachariasen s scheme , however , the soviet scientist a.a .",
    "lebedev had proposed , in 1921 , the concept of  crystallites \" @xcite , small crystal - like ( yet not truly ordered ) regions jammed against each other in random orientation to contain altogether all ( actually , almost all ) atoms in the glassy substance .",
    "later , randall proposed that these be real micro - crystals and explained the rounded - up x - ray spectra from glasses in this manner @xcite .",
    "however , the density of glasses is typically some 10% less than that of poly - crystalline aggregates and the thermal properties of glasses too can not be explained by means of the lebedev - randall picture . despite these observations ,",
    "the east - west dychotomy continued to these days .",
    "the zachariasen - warren model of glass structure was for instance criticized by hgg @xcite in the west right in the early days of x - ray crystallography and a good review of the status quo of this controversy has been recently provided by wright @xcite who concludes , from a re - analysis of x - ray and neutron - scattering data from many different covalent - bonded and network glasses that indeed so - called _ cybotactic groupings _ ( better - ordered regions ) may well be present and frozen - in in most glasses , particularly if multi - component ( or - one could add - polymeric @xcite ) .",
    "the formation of _ polyclusters _ , instead of jammed crystallites , in most glasses is the latest scenario by the eastern school @xcite , which is based on observations and kinetic reasoning .",
    "as nicely set out by bakai @xcite , the incipient crystals forming at and below @xmath3 ( melting point ) are in constant competition with kinetically swifter ( for glass - forming liquids ) embryo clusters ( or crystallites ) that can win thermodynamically and kinetically over crystals during a rapid enough quench forming a polycluster spanning the whole of the sample .    on the experimental side , the concept of de - vitrification has been gradually taking sway with reports of metallic glasses @xcite and also of monocomponent high - coordination covalent solids , like amorphous si , forming _",
    "paracrystals _ in their amorphous solids @xcite .",
    "therefore , the stance will be taken in this new review that only the purest mono - component glasses may ( perhaps ) abide to the zachariasen - warren dogma of the continuous random - network model for a glass , whilst the vast majority of real glasses @xcite will be organized differently at the intermediate - range atomic structure level .",
    "solid - like fluctuations of finite size are , in fact , likely to form already around and below the crystallization temperature @xmath3 , the formed solid - like clusters continuously breaking up and reforming in the supercooled state between @xmath3 and @xmath0 , which is indeed widely known to be characterised by the so - called dynamical heterogeneities ( dh ) .",
    "the slower - particle regions of the dh are , in the present author s view , to be identified with the solid - like ( better - ordered ) clusters and the faster - particle dh regions with the liquid - like ( completely disordered ) clusters that become thinner and thinner as @xmath0 is approached . in this vision , the lower temperature glassy structure ( now entirely solid - like ) inherits the inhomogeneous dh structure of the supercooled state , the slower , solid - like better - ordered regions having grown to a limit size ( e.g. a maximum average radius @xmath15 ) that is determined by the onset of the polycluster .",
    "-1 mm    the structure now proposed is a cellular - type arrangement of better - ordered atomic regions ( regions of enhanced ordering , rers ) that can have complicated , maybe fractal , but definitely compact shapes with a narrow size distribution and the interveening regions ( let s call them interstitials ) between them populated by still fast - moving particles ( normally charged and possibly dangling - bonded ions ) .",
    "the insterstitial regions between the rers are here the equivalent of the concept of _ cages _ , that is often discussed in the glass structure s literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we remark that a cellular - type structure was already embodied within the `` crystallite '' idea of lebedev , but now no micro - crystals are claimed here to exists ( except definitely in the ceramic - glasses case , to a good extent ) .",
    "the rers are more like wright s `` cybotactic regions '' @xcite or treacy s `` paracrystals '' @xcite ( there for a - si , not a quenched - melt solid ) and issue from the dh picture for the glass - forming supercooled liquid state above @xmath0 ( see e.g. fig .  [ fig1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the dh picture does indeed recognise the presence of regions of `` slower '' and `` faster '' particles , and an inspection of the slower - particle regions of the supercooled liquid reveals that these are also better ordered ( solid - like ) whilst the faster - particle regions are rather much more liquid - like .",
    "dh are ubiquitous in perhaps all supercooled liquids @xcite and the claim ( though still somewhat speculative ) here is that the slower - particle regions will grow on approaching @xmath0 , albeit only up to a finite size and will now be giving rise to the rers in the frozen , glassy state below @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , simulations in the frozen glassy state of the slower- and faster - particle regions do confirm that a dh - like picture applies also below @xmath0 @xcite and with the slower - regions s size @xmath16 increasing as @xmath17 .",
    "earlier simulations ( always for model systems ) @xcite did point out the difficulty of simulating the dh picture below @xmath0 and came up with a picture of these slower - regions growing , and possibly diverging in size , on approaching @xmath0 . in the present reviw",
    ", however , the stance will be taken that the slower - regions average ( even maximum ) size growths in real systems , but does not diverge at @xmath0 or at any other characteristic temperature .",
    "full experimental or numerical proofs of this fact are , unfortunately , still lacking and should be considered as a reasonable working hypothesis in this paper .",
    "indeed , the absence of a diverging characteristic length is , in a nutshell , the central enigma of the problem of the glass transition .",
    "we remark in passing that a cellular structure ( mosaic - like ) for the glasses had been proposed by de gennes @xcite in the past and , in the context of the low - temperature anomalies , by baltes @xcite who was able to explain the linear in @xmath1 anomaly in the heat capacity @xmath18 ( but not those in the acoustic properties , though , which require the introduction of tunneling ) .",
    "a very similar picture is that of the polyclusters of bakai @xcite , as was already mentioned , but in the present approach the thermal genesis of the cells , or rers , is ascribed directly to the dh scenario already present above @xmath0 . in this approach",
    "the rers , like grains or domains in the frozen structure below @xmath0 , are the thermal - history continuation of the slower - particle regions of the dh above @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ mosaicstructure ] we show how the rers themselves ( and not the single particles ) can get to grow to a limit intermediate - maximum size @xmath15 and randomly close - pack together in the proximity of the glass transition temperature @xmath0 , thus forming a highly correlated polycluster .",
    "the random close - packing process gets to be completed at a lower temperature @xmath19 ( @xmath20 possibly to be identified with the kauzmann temperature ) thus giving the glass transition more the character of a crossover .",
    "the spheres represent regions of better - ordered atomic particles that have grown to a limit maximum size and hinder each other s further growth . in the interstitial regions",
    "( voids between the spheres ) , not shown , are the remainder of the incipient glass particles : these are more liquid - like and mobile , while the rers that are shown need not be spherical nor completely mutually exclusive , partial coalescence being allowed . , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "-60 mm    as temperature drops further below @xmath20 , the cells or rers can slightly increase in size , consolidating their growth at the expense of the species present in the interestitials between the rers .",
    "this idea of consolidation at lower temperatures is shown pictorially in fig .",
    "[ lowtstructure ] .",
    "the cells and interfaces between the cells will contain the bulk of the tunneling systems .",
    "these 2lss are atomic tunneling states arising from the cells own disorder , but most of the 2lss should be located at the meeting point between two cells ( two rers ) . in the interstitial spaces between cells the remnant faster particles of the dh at @xmath21 give rise for @xmath22 to regions where a large number @xmath9 ( on average , per interstitial ) of charged atomistic tunneling particles are constrained to move in a coherent fashion due to the high coulomb repulsion forces between them .",
    "[ cellstructure ] shows in a schematic way how the atomic / ionic matter can get organised below @xmath0 in a real glass .",
    "-3 mm    since the charged ions ( dangling bonds , most likely ) should act as a coherently tunneling ensemble , it seems natural to simplify the description of the physics at the lower temperatures using only phonons , propagating in the collection of cells now jammed against each other , and remnant ergodic localized degrees of freedom acting as tss .",
    "these tss will be of two types : the 2lss within the cells and at their points of contact ( owing to inherent disorder in the cells atomic arrangement ) and effective quasi - particles sitting in the close - packed cells interstices and now representing the collective motion of the coherently - tunneling ions which are trapped in each interstice ( fig .",
    "[ cellstructure ] ) .",
    "-3 mm    the quasi - particle will be subjected to an effective potential of distorted tetrahedral topology characterized by four wells for each rer interstice , with minima inside each rer or - depending on the material - at the rer meeting points and a high barrier in the interstice s centre .",
    "_ de facto _ this 3d interstitial tfwp potential can be replaced by four local 2d potentials for the four quasi - particles describing the coherent tunneling of the faster - moving particles sitting near each face of the distorted tetrahedron , close to a group of three ( on average ) quasi - ordered cells ( fig .",
    "[ threewells ] ) .",
    "because of the better - ordering implicit in this model of the glassy intermediate - range atomic structure , and in each cell , the three wells of each effective local 2d potential for the tunneling quasi - particles ( four per interstice , on average ) should be near - degenerate in terms of their ground - state energy asymmetries : @xmath23 . with this ,",
    "still qualitative , picture in mind we now turn to the mathematical description of the physics of the remnant and still ergodic degrees of freedom ( phonons in the cells network - likely the origin of the boson peak - 2lss and atss ( anomalous tunneling systems , four in each interstice ) ) . for our model of a real glass , by construction",
    "the 2lss will be much more numerous than the atss .    in this approach @xcite the relevant degrees of freedom , beside the phonons ,",
    "are generalised dilute gases of independent 2lss described by the stm and of fictitious quasi - particles tunneling in twps .",
    "the formulation of the stm ( the 2ls model ) for the low temperature properties of glasses is very well known @xcite .",
    "one assumes a collection of dwps distributed in the substance and represented each by a 2@xmath242 effective hamiltonian of the form , in the potential - well ( or real - space ) representation : @xmath25 here the two parameters @xmath26 ( the energy asymmetry ) and @xmath27 ( twice the tunneling parameter ) are typically characterized by a probability distribution that views @xmath26 and @xmath28 ( the latter linked to the particular dwp energy barrier ) broadly ( in fact , uniformly ) distributed throughout the topologically disordered solid  @xcite : @xmath29 where some cutoffs must be introduced when needed and where @xmath30 is an elusive material - dependent parameter , like the cutoffs . in fact , eq .",

    "the phase interference from separate tunneling paths is only likely to give rise to an exceedingly weak quantum effect .",
    "hence , it will be those tss nesting between the rers that will give rise to an enhanced quantum phase interference and these tss can be minimally described ",
    "most appropriately and conveniently  through hamiltonian ( [ 3lsmagtunneling ] ) and with a distribution of asymmetries thus modified in order to favour near - degeneracy  @xcite : @xmath72 @xmath73 being a dimensionless ( which is pleasing ) material parameter .",

    "the etm has also shed much new light into the composition - dependent anomalies  @xcite . the new physics provided by the magnetic - field dependent ts dos , as mentioned , comes from a term due to the near - degenerate twps  @xcite and that gets to be added up to the constant dos from the stm 2lss ( having constant density @xmath81 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the atss concentration , while @xmath84 is a magnetic - field dependent dimensionless function already described in previous papers  @xcite and @xmath85 is a material and weakly @xmath78-dependent energy cutoff : @xmath86 moreover , after an irrelevant renormalization of parameters : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 being suitable ( material parameters ) cutoffs .",

    "having conceived a heterogeneously disordered , cellular make - up of the glassy state , it seems natural to ask what the implications for the onset of the glassy state would be .",
    "the crucial question is the definition of the glass transition , which can only be kinetic in nature given the continuity that is being advocated between the dynamical heterogeneities of the supercooled state and those of the glassy state .",
    "namely , it is envisaged that the better - ordered regions , or rers or solid - like clusters in the supercooled state grow in size with decreasing temperature till a limit size @xmath15 is reached . thereafter a mutually hindering state sets in for the maximally grown rers and they must grow through a completely different ( and much slower ) mechanism for consolidation to take place at the expense of the material ( if any ) in the interstitial spaces .",
    "naively we can take the temperature where @xmath15 is attained as the glass transition temperature @xmath0 .",

    "we can describe the dependence of @xmath0 , the temperature where the polycluster forms , on the cooling rate @xmath10 by envisaging a characteristic microscopic time @xmath105 for the cells rearrangement and an entropy ( per atomic species ) for the many ways the polycluster can be formed from the cooperative nucleation of such cells : @xmath106\\ ] ] much in the same spirit as in adam - gibbs treatment for the onset of the glassy state @xcite . on dimensional grounds , and treating this entropy as a response susceptibility for the glass transition , one then writes ( if @xmath107 is a characteristic energy , per atomic species , for the polycluster formation ) : @xmath108=\\frac{w_0}{t_g}\\ ] ] if the written form of the above susceptibility is regarded as a curie - like approximation in which the nucleating cells are not yet interacting , then the molecular - field improved form of the curie - weiss type would lead us to write @xmath109=\\frac{w_0}{t_g-\\theta } \\label{glasstrans}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is a characteristic temperature below @xmath0 that takes nucleating cell - cell interactions into account . a graphical study of the above eq .",

    "a full derivation from nucleation theory of the above reasoning will be reported elsewhere .",
    "qualitatively at least , our cellular - structure based etm explains all low - temperature experimental observations so far [ for a more complete discussion see @xcite ] .",
    "looking at the parameters which have been used for the best fits , one can not fail to recognize ( see e.g. table [ table91 ] ) that for the echo experiments the extracted values of the cutoffs for the parameter combinations @xmath112 are approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those used for the other experiments , namely for @xmath18 and @xmath113 .",
    "the latter have been carried out inside higher temperature ranges , as it turns out .",
    "this could be explained through a mechanism where the number of elementary atomic tunneling systems @xmath9 within each single one ats ( hence inside each interstice , or cage , between the rers or mosaic cells or grains ) gets to be characterised by a temperature dependence @xmath114 .",
    "namely : there is a consolidation mechanism especially important at the lowest temperatures where ions from the interstices get to be absorbed in the cells ( see fig .",
    "[ lowtstructure ] ) and the resulting number of coherently tunneling particles making up each ats diminishes with diminishing temperature .",
    "we have conducted an analysis of the paramagnetic magnetization of samples of duran , bas and bk7 glass reported in the literature as a function of temperature using the idea of the cell model and ats tunneling in the interstices with a temperature - dependent @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "we have obtained in this way good fits to the data and an estimate of the fe impurity concentrations that are in agreement with the concentrations extracted from the low - temperature @xmath18 data ( tables [ tab_imp_extr ] and [ tab_imp_extr_dur ] ) .",
    "the number @xmath9 of coherently tunneling ions making up each ats then enters the parameter combination @xmath112 as @xmath116 ^ 3 $ ] times a combination of factors specific for a single atomic tunneling particle and the @xmath1- dependence of the extracted combination of cutoff and other tunneling parameters receives its rationale . though it might seem surprising that the tunneling parameter @xmath46 of a collection of @xmath9 coherently tunneling atomic particles gets to scale like @xmath9 times a microscopic tunneling parameter , we remark that this is similar to what happens in the theory and experiments of a drop of coherent atoms in a bose - einstein condensate trapped and subject to a double - welled tunneling potential @xcite    at this point one could ask if the low temperature experiments hold some information on the cell size for the proposed polycluster structure of glass , given that we have extracted values of the ats concentration in the form of the quantity @xmath117 ( where @xmath83 is the ats number ( mass ) density ) ( see tables ) . it is reasonable to assume , in fact , that on average four atss sit in each interstice between four tetrahedrally close - packed cells and this allows for a determination of the cell size @xmath16 . if @xmath16 is the cell s radius , the volume of the interstitial space is @xmath118 and therefore we have , on average : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the solid s mass density .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 could be determined , in principle , from the normalization condition for the ats parameter distribution : @xmath121 however @xmath122 remains unknown from the fits to the data , so we can only make the reasonable guess that the quantity @xmath123 is of order 1 , to estimate @xmath124 .",
    "we then get the estimating formula for the average cell radius @xmath125^{1/3 } \\label{estimate}\\ ] ] so that at this point we can use the values of @xmath117 obtained in section 3 to give cell size estimates .",
    "we use , for the silicates : @xmath126 5 @xmath24 10@xmath127 g@xmath128 ( bas glass ) , 9 @xmath24 10@xmath127 g@xmath128 ( duran ) and [ as obtained in @xcite ] 1 @xmath24 10@xmath127 g@xmath128 ( bk7 glass ) .",
    "then , from the literature @xcite we get : @xmath129 3.1 g @xmath130 ( bas glass ) , 2.3 g @xmath130 ( duran ) and 2.5 g @xmath130 ( bk7 glass ) . using the above estimating formula",
    "( [ estimate ] ) we arrive at the size of the cells in terms of their radius : @xmath131 1.63 @xmath24 10@xmath132 cm or 163 @xmath133 ( bas glass ) , 1.54 @xmath24 10@xmath132 cm or 154 @xmath133 ( duran ) and finally 3.00 @xmath24 10@xmath132 cm or 300 @xmath133 ( bk7 glass ) .",
    "thus , from the low temperature experiments we get to estimate that for these silicates the cell size should be some 300 to 600 @xmath133 in diameter ( 2@xmath16 ) .",
    "is this a reasonable estimate ?    while high - resolution electron microscopy ( hrem ) images for the mentioned silicate glasses are not available in the literature , some hrem images of ( inevitably ) very thin samples of related glasses can be found .",
    "these are presented below , for the case of amorphous sio@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ cellfig](a ) ) , amorphous ( b@xmath4o@xmath7)@xmath134-(pbo)@xmath135 ( fig .",
    "[ cellfig](b ) ) and amorphous lio@xmath4@xmath136sio@xmath4 ( equimolar mixture , fig . [ cellfig](c ) ) .",
    "the cellular structure of these thin glass samples is clearly visible in these images , with the estimates for the diameter size 2@xmath131 500 @xmath133 , 600 @xmath133 and , respectively , 500 @xmath133 .",
    "while the second glass is not a silicate , the size of the cells as seen in hrem imaging for the two other silicates compares very favourably with the estimates for other silicates obtained from the low temperature work .",
    "it is therefore tempting to conclude that the estimate from the tunneling data at low temperatures lead to cellular sizes that are compatible with hrem imaging .",
    "this is also consistent with estimates for the number @xmath9 of coherently tunneling atomic particles that make up each ats .",
    "while @xmath9 depends on temperature as stated , estimates @xcite range from 10 to 10@xmath137 and while the nature of the microscopic tunneling entities is still unknown and should depend on composition ( in the case of pure sio@xmath4 this @xmath9 should be close to 1 ) these values are not incompatible with a cell size of some 500 @xmath133 in diameter . the question of the nature of the atomic coherently tunneling particles making up each ats in each cellular interstice remains completely unanswered .      in conclusion ,",
    "the cellular glass - structure backed ats etm for the magnetic effects in multi - component glasses ( the multi - silicates bas ( or albasio ) , duran and bk7 ) and contaminated mono - component vitreous glycerol has been fully justified in terms of a ( not entirely ) new vision for the intermediate - range structure of real glasses . in this scheme the particles are organized in regions of enhanced regularity ( rers ) and more mobile _ charged _ particles trapped in the interstices ( or cages ) between the close - packed rers .",
    "these are coherent ( owing to proximity and strong coulomb forces ) atomic tunnelers that can be modeled in terms of single quasi - particles with highly renormalized tunneling parameters .",
    "this model explains a large number of experimental data and facts with remarkable consistency also in terms of cross - checks like the determination of the concentration of trace paramagnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "the fact that pure amorphous silica ( spectrosil - i , for example @xcite ) shows no detectable magnetic effects is a consequence of the extremely small size of the rers for a - sio@xmath138 , deprived of almost any nucleation centres for both mosaic cells ( rers ) and polycluster formation .",
    "these rers will therefore trap a very small number @xmath9 of dangling - bond ionic particles , or none at all given the covalent nature of the si - o bonds .",
    "hence , no magnetic effects are observable in this purest , single - component sio@xmath4 glass .",
    "we remark at this point that the etm with two types of tss is not the only theoretical explanation that has been put forth for the explanation of the magnetic effects at low temperatures in the multi - silicate glasses .",
    "it is however the only theory that successfully explains all of the experimental data so far , including those for the compositional effects , and that links the deviations from the stm to the real structure of glasses at the intermediate atomic range .",
    "two other approaches have been in fact proposed to date , the one already mentioned based on the coupling of the 2lss to nuclei in the sample carrying neqms @xcite and the one based on the coupling of the 2lss to paramagnetic fe@xmath139 impurities @xcite .",
    "these two other approaches have shortcomings that will not be discussed here , since their model justification has no bearing on the real atomic structure of glasses and on the glass - forming process from glass - forming liquids ( the zachariasen - warren picture being  in fact  always tacitly assumed ) .",
    "polymeric glasses should also be well described by the present cellular model ( possibly also their surfaces @xcite ) .",
    "the present theory on the one hand bears heavily on the true structure of real glasses and it implies that the amorphous state should no longer be regarded as a dynamically arrested liquid , but rather as a new type of solid .",
    "it also shows on the other hand that the magnetic ( and compositional ) effects are a mere manifestation of the heterogeneous , cellular - type intermediate atomic structure of real glasses which abandons the zachariasen - warren picture for good . a cellular - type structure that has been advocated for by scientists , especially ( but not only ) in the ex - ussr , now for almost a century .",
    "it is not impossible that with this vision in mind the tss could become in the near future the right probes with which to study the structure of real glasses in the laboratory .",
