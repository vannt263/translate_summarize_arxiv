    "the odd - even mass differences has traditionally been attributed to nucleon pairing ( the largest part ) and breaking of the time reversal double degeneracy of the single particle levels ( the smallest part ) .",
    "other effects may contribute as well .    both experimentally and theoretically one observes significant , systematic deviations from the simple laws @xcite and it therefore seems worthwhile to make use of the recently updated , extensive and accurate , nuclear mass table @xcite to look more carefully for trends in the experimental odd - even staggering .",

    "the results were almost constant , when considering scattering , but for @xmath80 there was a clear decrease as a function of neutron excess .",
    "this transition was seen for both neutrons and protons .    to make the model globally applicable the separated results were recombined . since the odd - even @xmath6 configuration had a very modest influence on @xmath28 it was neglected .",
    "the neutron - proton pairing term accounted for the displacement of the odd-@xmath5 nuclei relative to the even-@xmath5 nuclei .",
    "similarly , odd-@xmath6 nuclei were displaced for @xmath27 .",
    "this resulted in two global expressions for the odd - even staggering effect as given in eqs  ( [ finaleq_light ] ) and ( [ finaleq_heavy ] ) .",
    "these odd - even terms have to be included in phenomenological expressions of the nuclear binding energy where the largest contributions , liquid drop and shell effects , can be maintained from previous studies .",
    "the separated and the combined expressions were compared to a two - term model , with a @xmath1 dependency , and our @xmath81 dependence showed greater accuracy both locally and globally .",
    "the overall root mean square deviations in all our fits are always ( significantly ) less than @xmath96  mev .",
    "there is as yet no theoretical explanation for a systematic neutron excess dependence of the odd - even staggering for heavy nuclei , i.e.  when nuclei fill the large shells , but the fact that the data follow the fit curves suggests that a  direct or indirect  dependence on isospin projection should be considered on top of the previously included physical explanations for odd - even staggering @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that calculations including three - nucleon forces have now been used @xcite to study the variation of the odd - even staggering in the heavy ca isotopes .",
    "the rapid progress in nuclear theory these years may give a new perspective on this old problem ."
