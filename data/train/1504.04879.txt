    "they show that @xmath17 .",
    "any smooth projective variety that looks sufficiently like @xmath18 then possesses a cohomology class @xmath6 with @xmath19 .",
    "hence , this class can not be in the image of the cycle class map .",

    "tate s conjecture is for smooth projective varieties @xmath4 defined over a field @xmath20 finitely generated over its prime field and for a fixed prime @xmath5 different from @xmath21 .",
    "it asserts that the cycle class maps in @xmath5-adic cohomology @xmath22 are surjective , where @xmath23 varies over all open subgroups of @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the algebraic closure of @xmath20 .",
    "there is an integral version of tate s conjecture in which @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath27 , but , like the integral hodge conjecture , it is false and it appears that it was not expected by tate .",

    "non - torsion classes not in the image of the cycle class map ( either in singular cohomology over @xmath28 or in @xmath5-adic cohomology ) were constructed over uncountable fields by kollr using very general hypersurface high - degree hypersurfaces in @xmath29 .    since the examples mentioned so far use either torsion cohomology classes or an uncountable ground field , colliot - thlne and szamuely asked in  @xcite*remark  2.2.3 whether a modified integral tate conjecture asserting the surjectivity of @xmath30 could still be true for smooth projective varieties over finite fields .",
    "however , in  @xcite , pirutka and yagita constructed counterexamples to the surjectivity of   over finite fields for @xmath31 .",
    "their examples are smooth projective approximations to the classifying spaces @xmath32 in characteristic @xmath33 for @xmath34 a simply connected affine algebraic group in the following cases : @xmath35 at the prime @xmath36 , @xmath37 at the prime @xmath38 , and @xmath39 at the prime @xmath40 .",
    "each of these groups has @xmath41 for some generator @xmath8 , and they show that @xmath8 is not in the image of the cycle class map .",
    "this result gives new counterexamples to the integral hodge conjecture and , by using integral models and reduction modulo @xmath33 , gives counterexamples to the modulo - torsion integral tate conjecture over finite fields , answering the question of colliot - thlne and szamuely .",

    ".    in all of these examples over finite fields , the argument actually goes by embedding the disruptive group @xmath11 into @xmath34 and then showing that some @xmath44 restricts to the class @xmath45 found by atiyah and hirzebruch . in other words , they show that @xmath19 in the atiyah - hirzebruch spectral sequence .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to return to these questions and give a different type of argument , for certain groups of type @xmath1 , relying on representation theory .",
    "let @xmath34 be a quotient of @xmath46 by a central subgroup @xmath47 .",
    "then , @xmath48 is injective , and we can write @xmath49 as @xmath50 , some multiple of @xmath51 of the standard @xmath52-dimensional representation of @xmath46 .",

    "namely , we use the fact that @xmath71 is generated by the chern classes of polynomial representations of @xmath34 .",
    "we then determine generators for the representation rings of @xmath55 and @xmath56 and compute , using a short ` sage `  @xcite program , the second chern classes of all of these representations .",
