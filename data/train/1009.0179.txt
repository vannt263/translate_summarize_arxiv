    "vesta is the largest basaltic fully differentiated asteroid .",
    "remote visible and near - infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of basaltic mineralogy on vesta s surface and the possible presence of other components @xcite . a large number of small asteroids that show a similar surface composition , the so - called v - type asteroids , populates the inner main belt @xcite .",
    "v - type asteroids have dimensions less than a few tens of km that can not sustain differentiation processes , therefore they must have been originated from one -or more- much larger , differentiated parent body .",
    "thus , it has been suggested that vesta is the parent body for v - types @xcite .",
    "+ to support this scenario , apart from the aforementioned compositional similarity , it has been shown that many v - types and vesta belong to a large asteroid family @xcite . to reinforce this link ,",
    "a 460  km wide crater has been detected on vesta @xcite . +",
    "another interesting aspect concerning vesta and v - types is that their visible and near - infrared spectra have been found to be similar to those of a particular suite of meteorites , namely the howardite , eucrite and diogenite achondrites ( heds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "+ on the other hand , it is also clear that neither all v - types nor heds are compatible with being derived from vesta ; therefore , it is suspected that they originate from multiple differentiated parent bodies @xcite . in this respect , it is significant that a few v - types have been discovered beyond the 3:1 mean motion resonance @xcite which can not be related to vesta on dynamical basis @xcite and -at least in the case of magnya- also on compositional basis @xcite .",
    "+ despite the general scenario described above is largely accepted , there are some observations that remain unexplained .",
    "first of all , v - types generally exhibit stronger absorption bands than vesta and steeper continuum both in the visible @xcite and in the 0.4 - 1.6  @xmath0 m  region @xcite .",
    "+ the reason for these discrepancies is not yet clear .",
    "possible causes are indicated in composition / texture differences or due to the effects of some alteration process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , like for instance those that have been demonstrated to cause optical alteration on silicate - rich s - type asteroids @xcite . however , on s - types the 1 and 2  @xmath0 m  absorption bands tend to become shallower by increasing space weathering ( i.e. increasing spectral slope ) , while this effect is not observed on v - types .",
    "v - type asteroids that have reddest slopes also show strong 1 and 2  @xmath0 m   absorption bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "vesta is found to be most comparable to howardites with a fine - grained size distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ on the other hand , the laboratory experiments conducted on heds and pyroxenes confirm that v - type materials should alter under the effects of ion bombardment and micrometeorite impacts , in a way similar to s - types , although the alteration timescale is likely somehow reduced @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we present a comprehensive model of space weathering of candidate v - types detected via sdss photometry @xcite .",
    "the present analysis aims to investigate whether or not v - type surfaces are affected by space weathering processes .",
    "we identify several interesting facts that support the presence of space weathering alteration , although its behavior appears distinct to what found on s - types .",
    "+ in doing so , our findings disclose interesting aspects of surface properties of vesta and v - types that are useful also in the context of the nasa dawn mission @xcite for what concerns mission planning and vesta s data interpretation .",
    "it has been demonstrated for s - type asteroids that visible spectral slopes can be successfully used to model the optical alterations of asteroidal surfaces due to space weathering .",
    "spectral slopes have been evaluated using different methods , mainly photometric data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectroscopy @xcite , leading basically to the same conclusions . + concerning v - types , spectroscopic data are available only for a restricted number ( @xmath170 ) of objects , preventing any significant characterization of the whole population .",
    "for this reason , in the present work , we will make use of sdss photometry reported in the moving object catalog v3 ( mocv3 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which allows the analysis to be extended to include a large number of objects ( 388 and 466 family and non - family v - types , respectively ) .",
    "v - types have been selected according to @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also include 52 v - types identified by the spectroscopic surveys smass , s3os2 , and sineo @xcite which are not included in the sdss mocv3 .",
    "it is important to underline that the list established by @xcite consists of _ candidate _ v - types and that spectroscopic data are needed for a robust identification .",
    "nevertheless , a comparison between candidate v - types and confirmed ones displays a good match @xcite .",
    "+ spectral slopes have been evaluated by linear best fit of the albedo using the sdss bands g , r,i , z. one sigma errors of sdss albedoes have been used as weighting factors for the fitting procedure . as for spectroscopic data",
    ", we first evaluated the albedo in g , r , i , z bands through cubic spline of the spectra and then proceeded with linear best fit .",
    "albedoes have been normalized to the r band @xcite .",
    "previous analysis of s - types and ordinary chrondrites ( ocs ) showed that the space weathering on asteroids is a process that , if no other alteration is present , is expected to progressively evolve over time until eventually a sort of saturation is reached .",
    "moreover , its efficiency depends on the location and past orbital evolution of the asteroids .",
    "+ in this work , the study of space weathering is done according to the model developed in a series of papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this model demonstrated that the aging , location , and past evolution can be condensed into a single parameter , named exposure @xmath2 .",
    "the exposure is proportional to the dose of radiation / ion received from the sun and scales as    @xmath3    where @xmath4 are the keplerian elements of the body , and @xmath5 is its average collisional age @xcite . for mbas we used proper elements",
    "given their stability on a longer timescale .",
    "ages are derived according to the collisional evolution of main belt asteroids @xcite .",
    "collisional lifetimes depend upon the diameters , which have been estimated using the measured average geometric albedo ( 0.3 ) of a sample of v - types @xcite .",
    "the collisional age of v - types spans from about 0.5 to 2.7  ga .",
    "these extremes correspond to the smallest and largest bodies of the sample , which have estimated diameters of about 1  km and 10  km , respectively . in what follows",
    ", it is assumed that the formation of vesta s family occurred sometime before the oldest age in the sample , namely @xmath6  ga , so that asteroid s age are set by subsequent collisional evolution .",
    "although vesta s family age is not well constrained , a recent work of @xcite found evidence for a much earlier origin , possibly dating 3.5 - 3.8  ga ago , than previously assumed @xcite .",
    "+ for the neos , given their short evolution timescale in near - earth space ( @xmath7  myr ) , the major contribution to their space weathering alteration comes from their past evolution into the main belt .",
    "therefore , for each neo we set @xmath8 equal to its computed average source distance @xcite and @xmath9 ( the average of mbas ) .",
    "the main results of our model can be investigated with the help of the slope - exposure scatter plot . for this purpose , we separated v - types belonging to the vesta dynamical family from non - family members @xcite .",
    "results are shown in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "for comparison , the trend derived for s - types is also shown . note that the latter is computed by the least - square fitting of s - type visible spectra of mbas detected by smass and s3os2 surveys ( a total of 750 objects ) , using the sdss bands fitting procedure , as described above .",
    "this trend is very close to the one derived by means of spectroscopic data in @xcite ( valid for @xmath10 ) , ensuring that the procedure adopted here is robust .",
    "figure [ f1 ] also reports v - type neos along with average slopes and range of slopes for a sample of 50 heds .",
    "note that these he d samples have similar grain size ( @xmath11  @xmath0 m ) ; thus , the observed spread in slope is likely due to differences in composition , rather than due to grain size effects .",
    "+ a number of interesting results can be derived from figure [ f1 ] .",
    "first of all , v - types are , on average , redder than heds .",
    "this difference is minimized for eucrite meteorites .",
    "to better study this difference , we report the slope histograms in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "the average slope gap between eucrites and mba v - types is about 0.6  @xmath0m@xmath12 , similar to that of s - types and ocs @xcite .",
    "the largest difference , of about 1.0  @xmath0m@xmath12 , is found for diogenites and mba v - types . + it is not easy to understand the origin for this marked difference with available data",
    ". it could be due , for instance , to systematic differences in grain size or observational conditions , such as the phase angle .",
    "however , it is hard to believe that these factors can be entirely responsible for the observed slope variations for the following reasons . concerning the grain size , we computed the effect of the particle size on the slope by analyzing two eucrites and one diogenite for which spectra with different particle sizes ( in the range 25 - 250  @xmath0 m ) have been gathered ( relab database ) . in this range ,",
    "the slope increases with decreasing particle sizes by about 0.4  @xmath0m@xmath12 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , to obtain the observed reddening on asteroids , their particle size should be much smaller than 25  @xmath0 m , a conclusion which seems unrealistic given the low - gravity environment of v - typesm , and only 10 - 20% of the particles have sizes",
    "@xmath13  @xmath0 m .",
    "moreover , thermal inertia modeling shows that asteroid s regolith is much coarser than the lunar one ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "] . moreover , we recall that the he d slopes used here are virtually the reddest , given that the particle size of these samples is below 25  @xmath0 m . concerning the phase angle of observations , it spans from about 2 to 30  deg , which is not too different from geometry conditions during spectra acquisition of he d samples @xcite .",
    "there also seem to be differences between family and non - family v - types .",
    "the latter shows a larger slope scatter and has a considerable number of objects having slope @xmath14  @xmath0m@xmath12 and @xmath15  @xmath0m@xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "these two extreme classes of object are separated by the bulk of the slope distribution , and might represent two distinct populations of objects .",
    "the `` blue '' non - family v - types ( @xmath14  @xmath0m@xmath12 ) are compatible with heds , and do not show any effect of spectral alteration",
    ". + the `` red '' v - types ( @xmath15  @xmath0m@xmath12 ) , are much redder than heds .",
    "their exposure is not systematically different than other v - types ; therefore the observed red slope is not justifiable in terms of space weathering .",
    "possible interpretations are that : either i ) they are s - types that are erroneously classified as v - types or ii ) if basaltic , they have a peculiar composition which is not sampled by heds . after a close look at sdss data for these objects",
    ", it seems that i ) could be ruled out ; however , v - nir spectroscopy is needed for a secure classification ( see end of this section for further comments on this issue ) .",
    "moreover , these extreme slope objects do not have any significant difference in terms of orbital parameters with respect to other v - types .",
    "although less evident , blue and red objects are also present among family v - types .",
    "+ interestingly , neo v - types are somehow in between heds and mbas .",
    "this is , at least for some neos , in agreement with their computed intermediate exposure , as also found for s - types @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the optical properties of neos can be affected by other processes like close encounters @xcite .",
    "the effects of the latter on v - type neos will be investigated in a future work .",
    "+ alternatively , several differences with s - types can be noted .",
    "the most striking is that the slope shows a negative trend for increasing exposures . in other words ,",
    "the more exposed objects tend to appear bluer , on average , than less exposed ones .",
    "the trend is less pronounced for non - family members , and becomes remarkably noticeable for family members .",
    "a linear best fit performed through minimizing chi - squared error statistics gives the following trends ( expressed in units of slope[@xmath0m@xmath12]/@xmath17)$ ] ) : @xmath18 and @xmath19 for family and non - family v - types , respectively .",
    "error bars are estimated taking into account 1-sigma errors of slope values .",
    "both trends are statistically highly significant with a t - distribution two - tailed probability of significance of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively indicates full statistical significance of the correlation . ] . for comparison ,",
    "the s - types trend is @xmath22 ( two - tailed probability of @xmath23 ) .",
    "+ in light of the above results , the unexplained lack of spectral reddening on vesta can be studied from a new perspective .",
    "first of all , there seems to be a general de - reddening trend with increasing exposures .",
    "these trends are also marginally present in terms of diameters , and become progressively more pronounced in terms of ages and exposures .",
    "this result suggests that the trends are not merely due to an asteroid size effect .",
    "note that vesta being merely the largest body ( i.e. the most exposed ) fits with this trend .",
    "+ the slope scatter of v - types is larger than that of heds , however the latter may be limited due to the relatively low number of samples used in this work . therefore , as for the heds",
    ", it is possible that much of the v - type slope spread may be due to compositional / texture differences .",
    "it could also be ( partially ) due to the presence of s - type -erroneously classified as v - types- interlopers within the lists used in this work .",
    "s - types are expected to have , on average , higher slopes than v - types @xcite . therefore , the possible presence of s - type interlopers may affect the observed excess of red objects , which likely has a negligible influence on the clear slope gap between he d and candidate v - types shown in fig .",
    "the main result of this paper is that v - type slopes are systematically redder than heds ( see fig . [ f1 ] ; fig .",
    "thanks to a large sample of candidate v - types , the present work considerably extends previous results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and allows quantitative estimates of the reddening of v - types .",
    "the spectral mismatch mimics what was found for ocs and s - types @xcite .",
    "the observed discrepancy could be due to factors such as systematic compositional / texture differences , different conditions of observations or space weathering .",
    "we showed that observational conditions and texture are unlikely to be the source of the observed discrepancy .",
    "therefore , either the marked slope shift between heds and v - types is due to systematical differences in composition , or it can be ascribed to some kind of space weathering alteration . the previous hypothesis would imply that the suite of he d compositions is not representative of the whole v - type population . while this is certainly an open possibility , it is mandatory to obtain v - nir spectra of small v - types to confirm . in the case",
    "that the slope mismatch is due to space weathering processes , it is possible to constrain the reddening timescale on the basis of the collisional ages .",
    "although a precise estimate is not possible with present data , an upper limit for the reddening timescale is set by the youngest v - type mbas which have ages of @xmath10.5  ga . moreover , 58% of v - type neos have a slope compatible with heds ( within 1-sigma of average values ) , while only about 20% of s - type neos are compatible with ocs @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if no other effect comes into play , it can be inferred that v - type s space weathering timescale is larger than a factor of @xmath13 with respect to that of s - types .",
    "+ the possibility that space weathering is responsible for the spectral mismatch is also reinforced by the few experiments published to date of ion bombardment of bereba eucrite and johnstown diogenite @xcite .",
    "they both exhibit reddening ( and darkening ) .",
    "note that these experiments also confirm a slower timescale with respect to ocs .",
    "+ the true nature of the spectral mismatch still remains elusive in several aspects ; nevertheless some noteworthy characteristics have been identified . in particular , we explore in detail the possibility that the spectral mismatch is due to space weathering processes . + first of all , the spectral slope anti - correlates with exposure to solar wind .",
    "this is the opposite of what was found for s - types and other spectral types @xcite .",
    "therefore , if some kind of sun - related space weathering is operating on v - types , either it behaves in a different manner with respect to s - types or other factors wipe out the reddening - exposure relation . concerning the latter , a possibility is represented by a composition gradient across v - types , from eucrite - like for the smallest members ( @xmath11  km ) to diogenite - like for the largest members ( @xmath110  km ) .",
    "this putative composition gradient would help to explain the observed slope - exposure trend for two reasons : i ) diogenites are bluer , on average , than eucrites ; and ii ) according to the few experiments available , the reddening of diogenites seem less pronounced than for eucrites , although the space parameters of he d compositions and alteration processes are far from being exhaustively investigated .",
    "+ note that the above explanation is preferred with respect to other possibilities , e.g. grain size variation , since the latter would require a grain size finer than @xmath24  @xmath0 m  ( i.e. higher slope ) for smaller objects .",
    "this is the opposite of what is expected , since smaller objects tend to have a larger grain size due to the low gravity .",
    "also , the substantial presence of s - type interlopers among the red v - types would not greatly affect the observed slope - exposure trend since they are nearly equally distributed in terms of @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "+ if confirmed , the above compositional trend among family v - types could be the result of cratering ejecta from various depths in vesta s crust ( eucrite is expected in the upper crust , while diogenite is expected in the lower crust ) ; or may be due to different episodes of cratering occurring in regions with different compositions .",
    "however , since large fragments are expected to originate in the near - surface spall region , the second hypothesis seems more probable .",
    "this may also be confirmed by the variety @xmath25ar-@xmath26ar shock ages of heds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spectral data of v - types seem to indicate that both mineralogies are present @xcite , but the limited sample prevents a firm conclusion .",
    "+ the proposed scenario could be tested as soon as more v - nir spectra of small v - types would become available .",
    "note that the above discussion holds for both family and non - family v - types .",
    "for the latter , however , the anti - correlation is less pronounced , and it becomes nearly flat if the outliers ( red and blue ) are excluded .",
    "this could be an indication that most non - family v - types have a different origin with respect to family v - types .",
    "+ the nasa dawn mission will aid in understanding the weathering process on vesta , thanks to spectral imaging and global mapping .",
    "therefore , the possibility to have detailed spectral information of specific areas of different composition and texture will shed light on the different effects of space weathering on basaltic asteroids .",
