    "quantum mechanical systems provide new resources to solve problems which are difficult to solve on classical computers .",
    "if we had a large quantum computer today , we could break cryptographic codes @xcite , perform a variety of search algorithms @xcite , estimate eigenvalues of operators @xcite , or simulate quantum systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , the latter would enable a better understanding of the quantum world by enabling analyses of complex chemical reactions or demonstrating new states of matter .",
    "however , questions like what are the physical quantum states that can be reached efficiently ? or what kind of physical processes can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer ? still remain open .",
    "since richard p. feynman conjectured that an arbitrary discrete quantum system may be _ simulated _ by any other @xcite , the simulation of quantum phenomena became a fundamental problem that a quantum computer , i.e. , a universally controlled quantum system , may potentially solve in a more efficient way than a classical computer .",
    "the basic idea is to imitate the evolution of a physical system by cleverly controlling the evolution of the quantum computer .",
    "quantum simulation is the process of faithfully imitating a physical phenomenon using a quantum computer .",
    "although feynman s illuminating conjecture seems appealing , it was only recently proved generally valid @xcite . experimentally demostrating that one has universal control and",
    "thus can quantum imitate an arbitrary physical process constitutes an extremely challenging enterprise .",
    "it is important to notice that the efficiencies of quantum simulating the evolution of a physical system and of obtaining the sought - after information about a physical property must be established separately in most cases . a demonstration that evolution",
    "can be simulated efficiently  @xcite , that is , can be simulated with polynomial resources as a function of problem size , is in general insufficient for showing that the desired property ( e.g. , the ground state energy of a given hamiltonian ) can be obtained efficiently also . in general , the exponentially large hilbert space that characterizes those physical systems and",
    "the inherent quantum parallelism of a quantum computer are insufficient for showing that an algorithm for quantum computation efficiently solves a problem .",
    "we pointed out in  @xcite that in a quantum computation , it is necessary to demonstrate that in addition to maintaining adequate accuracy ( noise , approximations , and statistical error control ) one also has to demonstrate the polynomial scaling of the three main steps of a simulation , initialization , propagation and measurement .",
    "some quantum processes can be simulated very well and efficiently on classical computers .",
    "simulating quantum phenomena using stochastic approaches reduces the problem to quadratures , which are multidimensional integrals that can be computed using monte carlo techniques . in general , the complexity of deterministic @xmath0-dimensional integration is of order @xmath1 ( i.e. , exponential in @xmath0 ) , where @xmath2 is some stipulated error and @xmath3 quantifies the smoothness of the integrand . on the other hand ,",
    "the expected complexity of monte carlo integration is of order @xmath4 , and hence independent of @xmath0 and @xmath3 ( assuming that the variance of the integrand is finite ) .",
    "the reason for introducing these statistical techniques was to overcome the exponential complexity of deterministic approaches such as the lanczos method @xcite .",
    "realistic models of liquid or solid @xmath5he have been simulated to experimentally measured precision for a few years @xcite .",
    "recently developed loop - cluster algorithms allow highly efficient and informative simulation of many quantum spin models of magnetism @xcite .    an important class of problems for which classical computers have major difficulties is the simulation of interacting fermionic systems ( almost all _ large - scale _ simulations of fermions are done by the monte carlo method ) .",
    "in fact , as noted in  @xcite , feynman and others prior to him intuited this difficulty .",
    "unless an approximation is made , the various quantum monte carlo algorithms must inevitably sample from a multivariate distribution @xmath6 that has regions of phase space where it is negative that are comparable to regions where it is positive ( because the state function belongs to the totally antisymmetric representation of the permutation group ) .",
    "in general , the nodal hyper - surface @xmath7 separating the regions is unknown ( an exception being when symmetry considerations alone determine it ) , making it impossible to solve the problem by independently sampling from each region where @xmath6 has a definite sign .",
    "the sign problem is prohibitive on a classical computer because it results in the variance of measured quantities growing exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "still other applications require sampling from a complex - valued distribution @xmath6 .",
    "this occurs , for example , if the simulation is done as a function of real minkowski time or if time - reversal symmetry is broken . in previous work",
    "@xcite , we have discussed how certain sign problems can be overcome using quantum network algorithms .    in this paper",
    "we describe how quantum simulation of many - body problems can be realized in liquid state nmr quantum information processors ( qips ) @xcite .",
    "the constituents of the system may represent particles with arbitrary exchange statistics and generalized pauli exclusion principle ( such as fermions obeying fermi statistics ) , spins , etc .",
    "in particular , we show how to efficiently imitate a resonant impurity ( localized state ) scattering process in a metal ( which is made of fermions ) , using the nuclear spins of a trans - crotonic acid molecule .",
    "this problem is physically modeled by a fano - anderson hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that the universal control achieved by the liquid state nmr qips enables efficient simulation of some fermionic ( and other particle statistics ) systems , providing relevant information about the particular phenomenon or system of study @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show how the spectrum of the fano - anderson hamiltonian can be determined .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "[ standardmodel ] we introduce the conventional model of quantum computation and use it to describe the physics of the liquid state nmr setting as a universal quantum simulator . in sec .",
    "[ simulation ] we show quantum algorithms for obtaining relevant physical properties of quantum systems satisfying different particle statistics , by mapping their algebras of operators into the spin-1/2 algebra ( conventional model ) . in sec .",
    "[ fanoanderson ] we introduce the fermionic fano - anderson model , and show how to simulate it in the liquid state nmr device .",
    "its experimental implementation as well as the results , and the conclusions are described in sec .",
    "[ experimentalimplementation ] and sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , respectively .",
    "in this section we introduce liquid state nmr quantum information processing methods , emphasizing the fact that they can be mathematically described in terms of pauli ( spin-1/2 ) operators @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of such methods can be found in @xcite .    in the conventional model of quantum computation",
    "the fundamental unit of information is the quantum bit or _ qubit_.",
    "a qubit s pure state , @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , is a linear superposition of the logical states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and can be represented by the state of a two - level quantum system such as a spin-1/2 .",
    "similarly , a pure state of a register of @xmath0 qubits is represented as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a product of states of each qubit in the logical basis , e.g. , its binary representation ( @xmath15 , etc . ) , and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "a quantum register can also be in a probabilistic mixture of pure states , i.e. , a mixed state , which is described by a density matrix @xmath18 , with @xmath19 representing the state of the register in the pure state @xmath20 , with probability @xmath21 .",
    "every density operator can be written as a sum of products of the pauli spin-1/2 operators @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , and @xmath24 $ ] ) and the identity operators @xmath25 acting on the @xmath26-th qubit of the register @xcite .",
    "the pauli operators can also be used to describe any unitary operation acting on the state of the register . in particular",
    ", every unitary operation can be decomposed in terms of single - qubit rotations @xmath27 $ ] , by an angle @xmath28 around the @xmath29-axis , and two - qubit interactions such as the _ ising gate _",
    "$ ] @xcite , defining a universal set of elementary gates . in fig .",
    "[ sm1 ] we show the quantum circuit representation of these basic operations .",
    "finally , in the conventional model of quantum computation the measurement is assumed to be projective and is described by projectors that can be expanded in terms of pauli operators .",
    "liquid - state nmr methods allow us to physically implement a slightly different version of the conventional model of quantum computation , with respect to the initial state and the measurement process . in this",
    "set - up the quantum register is represented by the average state of the nuclear spin-1/2 of an ensemble of identical molecules .",
    "since all molecules are equivalent , in the following analysis we will first consider only one of them .",
    "the spin state of each nucleus ( qubit ) of a single molecule is manipulated using resonant radio - frequency magnetic pulses ( rf pulses ) .",
    "the molecule is placed in a strong magnetic field @xmath31 tesla , so that the spin of the @xmath26-th nucleus precesses at its ( larmor ) frequency @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ larmor ] ) . in",
    "the frame rotating with the @xmath26-th spin , its qubit state can then be rotated by sending rf pulses in the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane at the resonant frequency @xmath35 .",
    "if the duration of this pulse is @xmath36 , the corresponding evolution operator in the rotating frame is @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the amplitude of the rf - pulse and @xmath39 is its phase in the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane ( @xmath40 )",
    ". then one can induce single spin rotations @xcite along any axis in the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane by adjusting @xmath36 and @xmath39 .",
    "single - qubit rotations around the @xmath41-axis can be implemented with no experimental imperfection or physical duration simply by changing the phase of the abstract rotating frame we are working with .",
    "we have then to keep track of all these phase changes with respect to a reference phase associated with the spectrometer .",
    "nevertheless , these phase tracking calculations are linear with respect to the number of pulses and spins , and can be efficiently done on a classical computer . together with the rotations along the @xmath33- or @xmath34-axis",
    ", the @xmath41-rotations can generate any single qubit rotation on the bloch sphere .",
    "on the other hand , the spin - spin interactions present in the molecule allow us to perform two - qubit gates and achieve universal control . to first order in perturbation ,",
    "this interaction ( called the @xmath42-coupling ) , has the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 denote the corresponding pair of qubits and @xmath45 is their coupling strength . under typical nmr operating conditions ,",
    "these interaction terms are small enough to be neglected when performing single - qubit rotations with rf pulses of short duration .",
    "nevertheless , between two pulses they are driving the evolution of the system . by cleverly designing a pulse sequence , i.e. , a succession of pulses and free evolution periods , one can easily apply two - qubit gates on the state of the system .",
    "indeed , the so - called _ refocusing techniques_ principle consists of performing an arbitrary ising gate by flipping one of the coupled spins ( @xmath46-pulse ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ refocalisation ] .",
    "the interaction evolutions before and after the refocusing pulse compensate leading to the effective evolution @xmath47 where the effective coupling strength @xmath48 is being determined by the difference between the durations @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we have so far described a quantum register as consisting of nuclei of a single molecule .",
    "however , liquid state nmr uses an ensemble of about @xmath51 molecules in a solution maintained at room temperature ( @xmath52 ) . for typical values of the magnetic field",
    ", this thermal state is extremely mixed .",
    "clearly , this is not the usual state in which we initialize a quantum computation since qubits are nearly randomly mixed .",
    "nevertheless , known nmr methods @xcite can be used to prepare the so - called _ pseudo - pure state _ ( @xmath53 ) @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a density operator that describes a pure state and @xmath56 is a small real constant ( i.e. , @xmath56 decays exponentially with @xmath0 ) .    under the action of any unitary transformation @xmath57 this state evolves as @xmath58 the first term in eq .",
    "[ ppstate ] did not change because the identity operator is invariant under any unitary transformation .",
    "therefore , performing quantum computation on the ensemble is equivalent to performing quantum computation over the initial state represented only by @xmath55 .",
    "after the quantum computation is performed , we measure the orthogonal components of the sample polarization in the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "note that the invariant component of @xmath61 does not contribute to the signal since @xmath62 .",
    "since the polarization of each single spin , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , precesses at its own larmor frequency @xmath32 , a fourier transformation of the temporal recording ( called fid , for free induction decay ) of the total magnetization needs to be performed . by doing so",
    ", we obtain the expectation value of the polarization of each spin ( averaged over all molecules in the sample ) .",
    "summarizing , a liquid state nmr setting allows us to initialize a register of qubits in a pseudo - pure state , apply any unitary transformation to this state by sending controlled rf pulses or by free interaction periods , and measure the expectation value of some quantum observables ( i.e. , the spin polarization ) .",
    "hence , these systems can be used as quantum information processors ( qips ) .",
    "richard p. feynman @xcite described a quantum computer as a universal reversible device governed by the laws of quantum physics and capable of exactly simulating any physical system .",
    "although he analyzed the problem of simulating physics assuming that every finite quantum mechanical system can be imitated exactly by another one ( e.g. , a set of qubits ) @xcite , he was unsure whether this statement remained valid for the simulation of fermionic systems .    in this section",
    "we describe how to obtain information about physical properties of any quantum many - body system ( fermionic , bosonic , anyonic , etc . ) by using a set of qubits ( spin-1/2 ) controlled by nmr techniques . a more complete description of these methods based on the existence of one - to - one mappings between the algebras used to describe the system to be simulated and the quantum computer @xcite , as well as indirect measurement algorithms @xcite , can be found in previous works @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the measurement of correlation functions of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is any time ( or other continuous parameter ) dependent unitary operator , using indirect measurement techniques @xcite .",
    "in addition to the qubits used to _ represent _ the physical system to be simulated ( i.e. , the system of qubits ) , an extra qubit called _ ancilla _ is required ( fig .",
    "[ qa1 ] ) .",
    "this qubit will be used as a probe to scan the properties of the system of qubits .",
    "it has to be initialized in the superposition state @xmath67 by applying the hadamard gate @xcite to the polarized state @xmath68 .",
    "then , it interacts with the system of qubits , initially in the state @xmath69 , through a controlled unitary operation @xmath70 . after this interaction ,",
    "we can show @xcite that @xmath71 ; that means we get the desired result by measuring the expectation values of the ancilla qubit observables @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .    using the same techniques we can determine the spectrum of an observable @xmath74 when choosing @xmath75 .",
    "figure [ qa2 ] depicts this algorithm @xcite .",
    "since the initial state can always be written as a linear combination of eigenstates of @xmath74 , that is , @xmath76 , with @xmath77 the eigenstates of @xmath74 having eigenvalues @xmath78 , and @xmath79 complex coefficients , a measurement on the polarization of the ancilla qubit gives @xmath80 .",
    "having the time - dependent function @xmath81 for a discrete set of values @xmath82 , the eigenvalues @xmath78 can in principle be obtained by performing a discrete fourier transform ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "note that the determination of each single value @xmath83 requires a different experiment .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath78 denote the spectrum of a system hamiltonian @xmath84 when replacing @xmath85 . in this case",
    ", the operation @xmath86 can be efficiently implemented  @xcite .",
    "however , methods for finding an initial state with an overlap @xmath79 that does not vanish exponentially with increasing system size , are in general not known .",
    "this issue arises , for example , when trying to obtain the spectrum of the two - dimensional hubbard model approaching the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .    nevertheless , the same basic procedure can be used when interested in obtaining dynamical correlation functions of the form @xmath87 ( i.e. , @xmath88 in eq . [ correl1 ] ) , where @xmath89 is the time evolution operator of a time - independent hamiltonian @xmath84 , and @xmath90 , @xmath91 are unitary operators . in fig .",
    "[ qa3 ] we show the circuit for an algorithm capable of obtaining these correlation functions after some simplifications @xcite .",
    "the evolution has three different steps : first , we perform a controlled operation @xmath92 .",
    "second , we perform the @xmath93 operation on the system , and third , a controlled operation @xmath94 .",
    "spatial correlation functions can also be obtained when replacing the operator @xmath93 by the space translation operator .",
    "again , this algorithm can be performed efficiently whenever the initial state @xmath69 can be prepared efficiently .",
    "the algorithm described above can be easily implemented with liquid - state nmr methods , since the result of the simulation is encoded in the expectation values of single qubit observables .",
    "so far , the algorithm applies only to the simulation of systems described in terms of pauli operators , such as spin-1/2 systems .",
    "however , other systems with different particle statistics can also be simulated with these algorithms after mapping their operator algebras onto the pauli spin-1/2 algebra @xcite . in the next section",
    "we introduce the fano - anderson model , a simple fermionic system , and show how to simulate it on a liquid - state nmr qip using these methods .",
    "the quantum simulation of the one - dimensional fermionic fano - anderson model provides a starting point for simulations of quantum systems with different kinds of particle statistics .",
    "the one - dimensional fermionic fano - anderson model consists of an @xmath95-sites ring with an impurity in the center ( see fig . [ fa1 ] ) , where spinless fermions can hop between nearest - neighbors sites with hopping matrix element ( overlap integral ) @xmath96 , or between a site and the impurity with matrix element @xmath97 . taking the single - particle energy of a fermion in the impurity to be @xmath56 , and considering the translational invariance of the system , the fano - anderson hamiltonian can be written in the wave vector representation as @xcite @xmath98 where the fermionic operators @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) create ( destroy ) a spinless fermion in the conduction mode @xmath103 and in the impurity , respectively . here",

    "[ hamilt2 ] is almost diagonal and can be exactly solved : there are no interactions between electrons in different modes @xmath103 , except for the mode @xmath107 , which interacts with the impurity . therefore , the relevant physics comes from this latter interaction , and its spectrum can be exactly obtained by diagonalizing a @xmath108 hermitian matrix , regardless of @xmath95 and the number of fermions in the ring @xmath109 .",
    "nevertheless , its simulation in a liquid - state nmr qip is the first step in quantum simulations of quantum many - body problems .    in order to use the algorithms presented in sec .",
    "[ simulation ] , and to successfully simulate this system in an nmr qip , we first need to map the fermionic operators onto the spin-1/2 ( pauli ) operators .",
