    "polynomial convexity of real submanifolds of @xmath1 is a well - studied subject in complex analysis due to its deep relation to the approximation problems , pluripotential theory and banach algebras ( see , for instance , @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "m.  gromov @xcite found remarkable connections between the polynomial ( or the holomorphic disc ) convexity of real manifolds and global rigidity of symplectic structures . in the present work",
    "we prove that a generic lagrangian surface in @xmath0 is polynomially convex near an isolated singularity which is topologically an unfolded whitney umbrella .",
    "this study is inspired by the work of a.  givental @xcite , where he proved in particular that a compact real surface @xmath2 admits a smooth map @xmath3 , isotropic with respect to the standard symplectic structure on @xmath0 , such that the singularities of @xmath4 are isolated and either self - intersections or unfolded whitney umbrellas .",
    "more precisely , if we denote by @xmath5 and @xmath6 the standard coordinates in @xmath0 , then @xmath7 is the standard symplectic form on @xmath0 . a smooth map @xmath8 is called _ symplectic _ if @xmath9 .",
    "since such a map is a local diffeomorphism , we call it a ( local ) _ symplectomorphism_. a smooth map @xmath10 from a smooth real surface @xmath2 is called _ isotropic _ if @xmath11 .",
    "a.  givental  @xcite showed that near a generic point @xmath12 , which is an isolated singular point of @xmath4 of rank one , the map @xmath13 is a local normal form for @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , this means that there exists a local symplectomorphism near @xmath14 sending @xmath15 onto a neighbourhood of the origin in @xmath16 .",
    "the set @xmath17 , as well as @xmath15 near @xmath14 , is called the _ unfolded ( or open ) whitney umbrella_. our main result is the following .",
    "[ t : ga ] suppose @xmath8 is either a generic real analytic symplectomorphism near the origin , or the identity map .",
    "then there exists a neighbourhood of the point @xmath18 in the surface @xmath19 with compact polynomially convex closure .",
    "the case where @xmath20 is the identity map is considered separately since it is not generic .",
    "this implies that the whitney umbrella @xmath17 is polynomially convex near the origin .",
    "the above theorem also holds under weaker assumptions , namely , if @xmath20 is a generic local real analytic diffeomorphism and @xmath21 , the differential of @xmath20 at zero , is symplectic , or if @xmath20 is a @xmath22-smooth symplectomorphism with the jet at the origin satisfying some additional assumptions .",
    "see section  5 for details .",
    "denote by @xmath23 the open euclidean ball of @xmath0 of radius @xmath24 centred at @xmath25 . as an application of theorem  [ t : ga ] we obtain the following result .",
    "[ c:1 ] let @xmath20 be as in theorem  [ t : ga ] .",
    "then for @xmath26 sufficiently small , any continuous function on @xmath27 can be uniformly approximated by holomorphic polynomials .    it will be shown in section 4 that the genericity assumption of theorem  [ t : ga ] imposes restrictions only on the 2-jet of @xmath20 at the origin .",
    "more precisely , it suffices to require that such a jet does not lie in a real algebraic submanifold of codimension 2 ( after the standard identification of the space of 2-jets at the origin with the euclidean space ) .",
    "our approach is based on the observation that @xmath19 is contained in the zero locus set @xmath28 of a strictly plurisubharmonic function with a unique critical point at the origin .",
    "hence @xmath28 is a strictly pseudoconvex hypersurface smooth everywhere except the origin .",
    "this allows us to consider the characteristic foliation induced on @xmath19 by the embedding @xmath29 .",
    "the origin is a unique singular point for this foliation .",
    "it follows by the hopf lemma that if @xmath30 is a holomorphic disc with boundary attached to @xmath19 , then its boundary is transverse to the leaves of the characteristic foliation at every point different from the origin .",
    "suppose now that the structure of leaves of the characteristic foliation near the origin is topologically the same as the phase portrait of a dynamical system near a saddle stationary point on the plane .",
    "then the boundary of @xmath30 will _ touch _ a leaf of the characteristic foliation proving that such a holomorphic disc does not exist .",
    "this observation suggests a strategy for the proof of our main result .",
    "the proof consists of two parts .",
    "first , we use oka s characterization theorem for hulls @xcite , developed and adapted to the case under consideration in the work of g.  stolzenberg @xcite , j.  duval @xcite and b.  jricke @xcite .",
    "this enables us to generalize the above argument and prove polynomial convexity of @xmath19 near the origin under the assumption that the phase portrait of the characteristic foliation is topologically a saddle ( sections 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper ( sections  47 ) is devoted to the study of the characteristic foliation near the origin . in section 4",
    "we write explicitly a 5-jet of the corresponding dynamical system on the plane ; the origin is a stationary point with a high order of degeneracy . at the end of this section",
    "we describe explicitly the genericity assumption on the @xmath31-jet of @xmath20 .",
    "section 5 is expository : for the reader s convenience we recall relevant tools from the local theory of dynamical systems ; in particular , we explain where the real analyticity assumption comes from . in sections  6 and  7",
    "we give a complete topological description of the phase portrait of the above dynamical system proving that it is a saddle .",
    "the problem remains open to determine local polynomial convexity for nongeneric whitney umbrellas as we have no counterexamples to theorem  [ t : ga ] if the genericity assumption is dropped .",
    "our method relies on the properties of the phase portrait of the dynamical system associated with the characteristic foliation near the umbrella , and can not be applied if some specific terms in the low - order jets at the origin of the map @xmath20 vanish . on the other hand , in applications to topological properties of surfaces",
    "the generic situation is often sufficient .",
    "furthermore , our method works in some nongeneric cases , for instance , for the standard umbrella @xmath17 ( this case is treated separately in sections  4 and  6 ) .",
    "convexity ( polynomial , rational or holomorphic ) of a lagrangian or totally real manifold @xmath32 embedded into @xmath1 have been studied by several authors ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . it is well known that the local polynomial convexity can fail near points where @xmath32 is not totally real . in the complex dimension @xmath33 ,",
    "the tangent space of @xmath32 is a complex line , so such points are called _ complex _ ; generically these points are isolated in @xmath32 .",
    "the complex geometry of these points is well understood by now .",
    "there are three types of generic complex points : elliptic , hyperbolic and parabolic ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , and the local polynomial convexity depends on the type .",
    "h.  bishop @xcite and c.  kenig - s.  webster @xcite proved that a neighbourhood of an elliptic point in @xmath32 has a nontrivial hull .",
    "on the other hand , f.  forstneri and e.  l.  stout @xcite proved that @xmath32 is locally polynomially convex near a hyperbolic point .",
    "the parabolic case is intermediate and in general both possibilities occur .",
    "this case was studied by b.  jricke  @xcite .",
    "these results and their development have several important applications , in particular , to the problem of complex and symplectic filling and topological classification of 3-contact structures .",
    "in general , a compact real surface does not admit a lagrangian or totally real embedding into @xmath0 , for instance , torus is the only compact orientable real surface admitting a lagrangian embedding into @xmath0 . by comparison ,",
    "givental s result is quite general as it applies to _ all _ compact surfaces .",
    "this makes it natural to study self - intersections and whitney umbrellas on immersed lagrangian manifolds in analogy with local analysis of real surfaces near complex points .",
    "currently , only few results are obtained in this direction .",
    "the present work is the first step in the study of the most general case where whitney umbrellas arise .",
    "our result implies that local convexity properties near a generic real analytic lagrangian deformation of the standard whitney umbrella are similar to those of a hyperbolic point .",
    "this is a necessary step leading toward understanding of the global geometry of immersed lagrangian manifolds containing whitney umbrellas .",
    "we thank s.  nemirovski and v.  shevchishin for bringing our attention to this problem and for helpful conversations .",
    "also we would like to thank the anonymous referee for many constructive comments that helped improve the exposition of the paper .",
    "the work on this paper was started in the fall of 2010 when the first author visited university lille - i and the laboratoire paul painlv , and was completed when the second author visited indiana university and the university of western ontario in the fall of 2011 .",
    "we thank these institutions for their support and excellent work conditions .",
    "the map @xmath34 given by is a smooth homeomorphism onto its image , nondegenerate except at the origin , where the rank of @xmath35 equals one .",
    "it satisfies @xmath36 , and so @xmath17 is a lagrangian submanifold of @xmath37 with an isolated singular point at the origin .",
    "thus , @xmath38    the crucial role in our approach is played by an auxiliary real hypersurface @xmath28 defined by @xmath39 clearly , @xmath17 is contained in @xmath40 .",
    "note that the hypersurface @xmath28 is smooth away from the origin , and strictly pseudoconvex in @xmath41 for @xmath42 sufficiently small .",
    "suppose now that @xmath8 is a local smooth diffeomorphism near the origin such that its linear part @xmath21 at the origin is a symplectic map .",
    "without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath43 .",

    "we perform an additional complex linear change of coordinates  @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 be a linear transformation given by the @xmath60 matrix @xmath61 this matrix commutes with @xmath62 and so gives rise to a nondegenerate complex linear map in  @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath63 and @xmath64    the differential at the origin of the composition @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 where we used identities to simplify the matrix .",
    "further , a direct calculation shows that @xmath67 and therefore , the matrix @xmath68 is symmetric with positive entries in the main diagonal .",
    "the determinant @xmath69 of @xmath68 coincides with that of the matrix in corresponding to a @xmath70-linear map of @xmath0 .",
    "hence @xmath71 is also positive .",
    "let @xmath72 , and @xmath73 it follows from and that    @xmath74    in particular , the function @xmath75 is strictly plurisubharmonic in a neighbourhood of the origin , and the hypersurface @xmath76 is strictly pseudoconvex in a punctured neighbourhood of the origin .",

    "@xmath25 in @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 , the assertion of the lemma follows .",
    "in this section we explain the strategy of the proof of theorem  [ t : ga ] .",

    "we consider the characteristic foliation of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "characteristic foliations are invariant under biholomorphisms .",
    "therefore , in order to study the characteristic foliation on @xmath19 with respect to @xmath92 , it is sufficient to study the characteristic foliation of @xmath93 with respect to @xmath76 .",

    "for the proof of proposition  [ l:2 ] we need to determine the topological structure of the _ orbits _ or _ maximal integral curves _ associated with the vector fields defined by   and  .",
    "both systems have higher order degeneracy ( the linear part vanishes ) at the origin , and consequently it is a _",
    "nonelementary _ singularity of   and  .",
    "therefore , standard results , such as the hartman - grobman theorem , do not apply here .",
    "instead , we will use some more advanced tools from dynamical systems",
    ". we will be primarily interested in understanding the topological picture of   and   near the origin up to a homeomorphism preserving the orbits . in this section",
    "we outline relevant results and recall some common terminology .",
    "the local phase portrait of a vector field near a nonelementary isolated singularity can be determined through a finite sectorial decomposition .",
    "this means that a neighbourhood of the singularity is divided into a finite number of sectors with certain orbit behaviour in each sector .",
    "if the vector field has at least one _ characteristic _ orbit ( i.e. , orbits approaching in positive or negative time the singularity with a well - defined slope limit ) , then the boundaries of the sectors can be chosen to be characteristic orbits .",
    "the overall portrait is then understood by gluing together the topological picture in each sector .",
    "the general result due to dumortier  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) can be stated as follows :    _ suppose that a @xmath22-smooth vector field @xmath411 singular at the origin in @xmath46 satisfies the ojasiewicz inequality @xmath417 for @xmath418 is some neighbourhood of the origin",
    ". then @xmath411 has the finite sectorial decomposition property , that is , the origin is either a centre ( all orbits are periodic ) , a focus / node ( all orbits terminate at the origin in positive or negative time ) , or there exists a finite number of characteristic orbits which bound sectors with a well - defined orbit behaviour ( hyperbolic , parabolic , or elliptic ) .",
    "if the vector field @xmath411 has a characteristic orbit , then its phase portrait is determined by its jet of finite order @xmath419 , in the sense that any other vector field with the same jet of order @xmath419 at the origin has the phase portrait homeomorphic to that of @xmath411 .",
    "further , whether the vector field @xmath411 has a characteristic orbit depends only on a jet of @xmath411 of some finite order . _",
    "the original proof of the above result in @xcite is based on the desingularization by means of successive ( homogeneous ) blow - ups .",
    "after each blow - up the singularity is replaced by a circle , and after a finite number of such blow - ups one obtains a vector field with only nondegenerate singularities .",
    "the construction of the blow - up maps depends only on a finite order jet of the original vector field at the origin . from the configuration of the singularities of the modified system on the preimage of the origin under the composition of blow - ups ,",
    "it is always possible to deduce if the original vector field has a characteristic orbit .",
    "if such an orbit exists , then the singularity is not a centre or a focus , and the phase portrait is determined by a jet of finite order .",
    "further , the ojasiewicz inequality holds for any real analytic vector field in a neighbourhood of an isolated singularity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and , in particular , in our case , in view of lemma  [ l : iso ] .    alternatively , it is possible to use _ quasihomogeneous _ blow - ups , which are chosen according to the newton diagram associated with @xmath411 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage is that this gives a computational algorithm for constructing the sectorial decomposition for a particular system . a detailed discussion of this approach for real analytic systems is given in bruno @xcite in the language of normal forms .",
    "using bruno s method we will show that for a real analytic @xmath20 in general position , the vector field defined by will always have a characteristic orbit , and its phase portrait near the origin is a saddle .    if in theorem  [ t : ga ]",
    "the map @xmath20 is smooth , then the vector field corresponding to the characteristic foliation is only smooth , and the ojasiewicz inequality imposes additional assumption on the vector field , and therefore on @xmath20 .",
    "the ojasiewicz condition depends on the jet of the vector field at the origin and holds for all jets outside a set of infinite codimension in the space of jets , but it is not clear whether for a generic smooth symplectomorphism the inequality is satisfied .",
    "however , assuming that the ojasiewicz condition does hold , the topological picture of the characteristic foliation is determined by its finite jet at the origin .",
    "therefore , we may consider a polynomial vector field obtained by truncation of at sufficiently high order without distorting the phase portrait of the system .",
    "after that we may apply bruno s method to determine its geometry .",
    "thus , in theorem  [ t : ga ] we may assume that @xmath20 is a generic smooth symplectomorphism such that the vector field corresponding to the characteristic foliation satisfies the ojasiewicz inequality .",
    "if in theorem  [ t : ga ] the map @xmath20 is a real analytic diffeomorphism with @xmath21 symplectic , then all of the arguments go through provided that the vector field vanishes at the origin only .",
    "the latter holds for the following reason : consider near the origin the complexification @xmath420 of the real analytic map @xmath421 .",
    "then @xmath422 is a holomorphic map such that @xmath423 , in particular , @xmath424 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath30 has rank 2 outside the origin , it follows that the jacobian of @xmath420 does not vanish on @xmath292 , and therefore , @xmath420 is a local biholomorphism near any point on @xmath292 . but",

    "now we need to investigate the situation near points where the above expression vanishes . for this",
    "we solve the quadratic equation @xmath682 the discriminant of this equation is @xmath683 since @xmath684 , it follows that @xmath685 . here",
    "@xmath71 is defined by .",
    "thus , equation always has two simple roots : @xmath686 ( since we consider the generic case , we can assume that @xmath687 ) .",
    "we point out that @xmath688 are either both positive or both negative .",
    "we need to investigate the dynamics near each point @xmath689 . for that we first need to translate @xmath688 to the origin via @xmath690 in the new",
    "coordinates the system becomes @xmath691 this is a system for which the origin in an elementary singularity ( the linear part is not zero ) . to determine the dynamics we need to understand the sign of the coefficients of the linear part , i.e. , of @xmath692 and @xmath693      first note that @xmath694 and @xmath695 depend only on the coefficients @xmath698 , i.e. , only on the linear part of the map @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , it is enough to prove the claim for linear symplectomorphisms .",
    "if @xmath20 is the identity map , then it is easy to see that @xmath694 and @xmath695 are of the opposite sign .",
    "suppose that for some linear symplectic map @xmath699 , the sign of @xmath694 and @xmath695 is the same . since the symplectic group is connected , there is a path @xmath700 connecting the identity and @xmath699 , and since @xmath701 depend continuously on @xmath20 , there exists a symplectic map on @xmath102 for which one of the @xmath701 is zero .",
    "since @xmath702 , it has to be @xmath694 .",
    "so @xmath703 .",
    "therefore , @xmath704 this implies that @xmath705  contradiction .",
    "this proves the claim .",
    "since @xmath701 are of different sign , it follows that both for @xmath696 and @xmath697 , system   is a saddle at the origin .",
    "now we are able to describe the overall dynamics in @xmath706 . in @xmath707-",
    "coordinates we have the following : @xmath605-axis as well as the lines @xmath708 and @xmath709 are the integral curves .",
    "more precisely , the integral curves are six half - lines : @xmath710 , @xmath711 , @xmath712 , @xmath713 , @xmath714 , @xmath715 , and one interval @xmath716 .",
    "the phase portraits near the points @xmath717 and @xmath718 are saddles , whose orbits in between the lines @xmath708 and @xmath709 are glued together , and are asymptotic to @xmath719 , @xmath720 or to @xmath721 , @xmath722 ; they do not touch @xmath723 .",
    "other orbits are asymptotic to @xmath721 , @xmath724 or to @xmath724 , @xmath719 or to @xmath725 , @xmath722 or , finally , to @xmath725 , @xmath720 ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "going back to the original system via the inverse transformation to  , we see that the @xmath605-axis blows down to a point , and we have two integral curves @xmath726 entering the origin , while other integral curves are contained in the compliment of these two curves .",
    "now , if we choose @xmath26 sufficiently small in , we see that both curves @xmath726 enter @xmath706 .",
    "this completes _ case 5 .",
    "_    now if we combine all 5 cases together , and glue the integral curves from all cases , we see that the phase portrait at the origin of system   is a saddle ( fig .  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "with this analysis we can now conclude the proof of proposition [ l:2 ] .",
    "indeed , let @xmath95 and @xmath96 be the curves @xmath726 .",
    "if @xmath100 is a small compact not contained in the union of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , then one of the hyperbolas of the characteristic foliation will touch @xmath100 at some point .",
