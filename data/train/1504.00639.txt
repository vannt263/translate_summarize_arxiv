    "[ fig : exp1_1 ] . for every value of @xmath61 ,",
    "the energy harvested by beaconing is higher than for probing .",
    "this is due to restriction of probing , where at most one etx can charge the erx during a beacon period .",
    "the beaconing protocol allows multiple etx to be turned on at the same time .    as the @xmath61increases , the harvested energy decreases for both protocols  beaconing and probing .",
    "naturally , the higher the threshold is , the less probability that the etx would be triggered on by neighboring erx .",
    "as expected , the freerun mode has the highest harvested energy in almost every testing point , because all etxs are switched on all the time .",
    "we are now ready to present the fundamental result of this paper , _ proving the `` green '' aspect of the designed wptn_. in addition to harvested energy we show total energy used ( in kj ) by all etx during the whole experiment , refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : exp1_0 ] .",
    "we clearly see the power saved by the beaconing and probing protocol , compared with the freerun mode ( for probing  by almost five times ) . since freerun mode switches etx all the time , the energy consumption by etx is highest and constant over @xmath61 .",
    "we discuss the reason behind this gain in detail in subsequent sections .      the power consumption of the probing protocol is higher than for beacon in our measurements .",
    "the main reason is that probing needs erx to receive the probing command from the etx , measure the signal strength and send feedback packets to the charger .",
    "the etxs request erx to measure harvested power in every beacon round .",
    "note that probing protocol uses three message types to trigger the charging phase , see protocol  [ alg : erx_states ] , while beaconing protocol uses only one message to trigger charging , see protocol  [ alg : beaconing_implementation ] .    as the @xmath61increases , the power consumption by the erx with probing decreases .",
    "the reason is that the larger the @xmath61is , the less probability that etx will accept charge request messages from the erx .",
    "then larger @xmath61causes less number of etx to associate with the erx on probing , which further causes less number of communication messages at erx .",
    "compared with the beaconing protocol , probing stays on a stable level for each @xmath61 . at 70dbm ,",
    "the efficiency of probing is around three times larger than beaconing . at 50dbm , the efficiency of beaconing increases .",
    "the main reason is that @xmath61  represents the range that etx evaluates whether the erx can be successfully charged or not .",
    "the larger the @xmath61is , the smaller the threshold range is , and the higher energy erx can harvest in the range .",
    "therefore , smaller @xmath61value results in higher efficiency .",
    "the benefit of using smaller threshold @xmath61is that the power transmission efficiency increases .",
    "the drawback is that decreasing range causes decreasing harvested energy , see fig  [ fig : exp1_1 ] .",
    "the freerun mode always takes the lowest charging efficiency because it can not estimate whether erx is inside or outside the wptn and what is the possible harvesting power .",
    "if the receiver is outside the wptn or in the area with very low power radio , switching on etxs will waste a lot of power . in the experiment ,",
    "the disappearing time of erx is 15s .",
    "we conjecture that if the disappearing time increases the efficiency of freerun mode will be even lower .",
    "probing protocol keeps relatively high and stable accuracy from 70dbm to 50dbm .",
    "high accuracy causes the high efficiency in probing based protocol as shown in fig  [ fig : exp1_2 ] . in probing ,",
    "only one etx is allowed to charge the erx which potentially decreases the accuracy .",
    "we hypothesize that if multiple etxs could exploit probing - like protocol at the same time the accuracy and efficiency could further increase",
    ".    the accuracy of beaconing increases as the threshold increases from 70dbm to 50dbm  the higher @xmath61value is , the closer the erx must be to an etx for triggering the charging . and",
    "the closer the erx is to the charger , the higher the probability that the etx can charge the erx .",
    "freerun mode naturally has the worst charging accuracy  the erx can hardly harvest sufficient energy at certain positions while etxs are continuously switched on .      to verify theoretical analysis of time to charge in both protocols",
    ", we have conducted an experiment , where we have placed erx less than 50 cm to each of etx devices ( to ensure erx is within charging range of all etxs ) . to emulate erx being within charging range of a given erx",
    ", we would connect or disconnect powercast device from arduino microcontroller .",
    "for each value of @xmath13 from @xmath62 ( one etx connected ) to @xmath63 ( four etxs connected ) we have performed an experiment where erx appears randomly in the network 50 times .",
    "afterwards , we measured the time it takes from appearing in the network to being charged .",
    "a cdf values of those experiments are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_to_charge_results ] . in this figure experimental results ( solid lines ) are compared against theoretical results ( dashed lines ) . for fig .",
    "[ fig : beaconing_time_n4k1]fig .",
    "[ fig : beaconing_time_n4k4 ] additionally a cdf of @xmath64 is added .",
    "we see that beaconing is faster in reaching etx than probing , however with increasing @xmath13 time to charge for probing becomes very low as well ( almost instant connection after approximately two seconds ) . for beaconing ,",
    "irrespective of number of etx , the time to charge stays constant .",
    "the discrepancy between experimental and numerical results is due to approximation of not taking into account propagation and processing time .",
    "nevertheless the analysis follow the trends of the experimental results in all cases reasonably well .",
    "in this experiment , we have tested the performance of wptn , in which the erx is inside the communication range while outside the charging range of etx .",
    "we change the experiment setup in fig .",
    "[ fig : wptn_setup ] by turning etx 1 and 3 by 180 degrees around its axis .",
    "results in this testing scenario and previous section are depicted as _",
    "back _ , and _",
    "normal_. etx @xmath61is set to 70dbm .      in both normal and back condition ,",
    "the harvested energy of beaconing protocol is larger than the probing protocol . by beaconing protocol",
    "the harvested energy in back condition decreases by 45% from the normal condition , which fits with the experiment setup by turning two chargers 180 degrees back .",
    "the decreasing percent in probing from normal to back condition is 32% , which is smaller than in beaconing protocol .",
    "this is because probing selects the etx that can charge energy over the threshold @xmath61 .",
    "as expected , the power consumption of etxs in beacon protocol and freerun mode maintains at the same level in both normal and back conditions .",
    "beacon protocol does not give etxs the function to know whether the charging power is efficiently harvested not .",
    "therefore , as in the back condition , even if the erx is outside the charging range , the charger still switches on as it hears the request message from the erx .",
    "lots of energy is wasted in the back condition by beaconing protocol . in probing protocol",
    ", the ` back ' etxs ( etx 1 and etx 3 ) will switch off , after they evaluate the harvested energy at the erx is low .      for both protocols , beaconing and probing ,",
    "the scheduling of the communication in erx are not influenced by the topology of wptn .",
    "so the power consumption in communication in both normal and back conditions are almost the same .      by beaconing protocol",
    ", the efficiency in the back condition decreases by 45% from the normal condition .",
    "the decrease in probing protocol from normal to back condition is 25% , which is much smaller than for beaconing .",
    "the smaller decreasing percent is because probing protocol makes etx work only when the charged energy is over @xmath61 .",
    "the 25% decrease mainly comes from the probing period when the etx is turned on and asks the erx to measure the harvested power . in our hardware implementation",
    "the probing period is very short ( 4s ) and we speculate that increasing the probing period can further increase the efficiency of probing based protocol in the back condition .",
    "the accuracy trends in the non - line of sight scenario are the same as in line - of - sight case , sec .",
    "[ sec : accuracy_los ] . also , as in the previous case probing protocol obtains the highest accuracy and confirms its supremacy over the other two considered approaches .",
    "with these results we do believe we open up a new research direction within wptn and we are aware of many points of improvement",
    ". we list the most important ones here .    1",
    ".   considering beaconing protocol , the charge request rate should be optimized with respect to power consumption and harvested energy of the erx .",
    "for example , the beacon period can adapt to the number of erxs in the wptn .",
    "since as long as one erx calls the charger to switch on there is no need to trigger etxs for every erx .",
    "considering probing protocol , the probing frequency should be optimized with respect to power consumption of probing as well .",
    "erxs should optimize the probing scheduling considering static and dynamic conditions .",
    "for example , when the erx is static , there is no need to make the receiver measure harvested power with high frequency , since the harvested power is not expected to fluctuate much in such case .",
    "3 .   wptn should optimize the combinations of the subset of switched on etxs to take advantage of the constructive signal combined at the erx . measuring all possible combination of the subset of the neighboring etxs to switch on consumes too much time and power at the erx .",
    "thus a novel charge control algorithms are required to enable green wptn with multiple etxs operating at a time .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a new class of charging control protocol for wireless power transfer networks ( wptns)denoted as ` green'that conserve energy of the chargers .",
    "the purpose of such protocol is to maximize three metrics of interest to wptns ( that we introduced here for the first time ) : ( i ) etx charge accuracy , ( ii ) etx charge efficiency and ( iii ) erx harvested power , which in - turn minimize unnecessary uptime of wptn energy transmitters .",
    "we prove that this problem is np - hard .",
    "to solve it we propose two heuristics , denoted as ` beaconing ' ( where energy receivers simply request power from transmitters ) and ` probing ' ( based on the principle of charge feedback from the energy receivers to the energy transmitters ) .",
    "the strength of our protocols lies in making few assumptions about the wtpn environment .",
    "we conclude that each protocol performs its task best in two special cases .",
    "experimentally we show that for large distances between chargers and receivers , probing is more efficient and accurate but harvests less energy than beaconing and has higher communication cost . as the charger to receiver distance increases ,",
    "the efficiency of the beaconing - based protocol increases ( since communication range is well correlated with charging range ) .",

    "<S> unfortunately , wireless power transfer itself  especially through radio frequency radiation rectification is fairly inefficient due to decaying power with distance , antenna polarization , etc .. consequently , idle charging needs to be minimized to reduce already large costs of providing energy to the receivers and at the same time reduce the carbon footprint of wptns . in turn , </S>",
    "<S> energy saving in a wptn can be boosted by simply switching off the energy transmitter when the received energy is too weak for rectification . therefore in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose , and experimentally evaluate , two `` green '' protocols for the control plane of static charger / mobile receiver wptn aimed at optimizing the charger workflow to make wptn green . </S>",
    "<S> those protocols are : ` beaconing ' , where receivers advertise their presence to wptn , and ` probing ' exploiting the receiver feedback from wtpn on the level of received energy . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that both protocols reduce the unnecessary wtpn uptime , however trading it for the reduced energy provision , compared to the base case of ` wptn charger always on ' . </S>",
    "<S> for example , our system ( in our experiments ) saves at most @xmath080% of energy and increases 5.5 times the efficiency with only @xmath017% less energy possibly harvested . </S>"
