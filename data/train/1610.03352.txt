    "ever since topological superfluids / superconductors with majorana modes were predicted to exist  @xcite , it has been a major research goal to detect them .",
    "experimental evidence for majorana modes have been reported in 1d wires  @xcite , and sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 is a promising candidate for realising a 2d topological superconductor  @xcite .",
    "an unambiguous detection of topological superconductivity / superfluidity is however still lacking , partly due to the complexity of these condensed matter systems .",
    "there are several proposals to use the clean and highly flexible atomic quantum gases to overcome this difficulty .",
    "the first scheme was based on fermi gases interacting via a @xmath3-wave feshbach resonance  @xcite , but these systems suffer from short lifetimes  @xcite .",
    "other quantum gas proposals include schemes based on optical lattices  @xcite , synthetic spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , driven dissipation  @xcite , dipolar molecules  @xcite , and mixed dimension fermi - fermi mixtures  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , none of these systems have been realised so far .",
    "very recently , two of us ( zw and gmb ) demonstrated that a mixed dimension fermi - bose mixture constitutes a promising system to realise a 2d topological superfluid  @xcite . in this proposal ,",
    "identical fermions are confined in a 2d plane and they interact via density modulations in a surrounding bec . due to the high compressibility of the bec ,",
    "this induced interaction is strong , and one can moreover control the range by varying the bec coherence length .",
    "this flexibility can be used to make the critical temperature of the topological superfluid high , while keeping three - body losses small .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to examine this promising scheme in a setup , where the fermions are moving in a 2d optical lattice .",
    "optical lattices offer the particular advantage of single site resolution spectroscopy  @xcite , which presents unique opportunities to detect and manipulate majarona edge modes  @xcite .",
    "we therefore investigate the phase diagram of identical fermions moving in a 2d square lattice immersed in a 3d bec , which gives rise to an attractive induced interaction between the fermions . as a result , the ground state of the fermions is a topological @xmath0 superfluid , but the system also suffers from a phase separation instability originating from an underlying particle - hole symmetry in the lattice . taking the competition of these two instabilities into account , we calculate the zero temperature phase diagram of the fermions as a function of the bose - fermi coupling strength and the filling fraction . we show how to use the flexibility of the bose - fermi system to tune the interaction in order to maximise the pairing strength , while keeping the system stable against phase separation .",
    "the key point to solve this delicate problem turns out to be to adjust the range of the interaction by changing the bec coherence length , so that it induces pairing on neighboring sites , while it does not lead to a significant long range interaction effects beyond nearest neighbors .",
    "we finally calculate the bkt critical temperature for the superfluid phase and discuss experimental realisations .",
    "we consider fermionic atoms of mass @xmath4 moving in a 2d square lattice in the @xmath5-plane . the lattice is immersed in a 3d bec consisting of atoms with mass @xmath6 , which is weakly interacting with @xmath7 , so that it can be accurately described by bogoliubov theory . here",

    "we have the usual bogoliubov relation @xmath38 with @xmath39/2 $ ] and @xmath40/2 $ ] .",
    "since the bosons live in 3d whereas the fermions are confined to a 2d lattice , we expect the bec to be essentially unaffected by the fermions . on the other hand ,",
    "the fermions interact with each other via the bosons and we will in this section derive an effective hamiltonian describing this .",
    "one fermion will either attract or repel the bosons thereby changing the local density of the bec , which is felt by the second fermion .",

    "the chern number is @xmath96 for a filling fraction @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "there is therefore a topological phase transition at half filling , @xmath100 , where the spectral gap closes at the points @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the brillouin zone .",
    "the system becomes unstable towards phase separation when the induced interaction between the fermions is too attractive , which originates from the underlying particle - hole symmetry due to the lattice .",

    "the region of phase separation can be determined by the maxwell construction .",
    "due to the particle - hole symmetry , this simplifies into the condition that a system with average filling fraction @xmath104 phase separates into regions with filling fractions @xmath108 and @xmath109 determined by @xmath110 .",
    "the resulting range of filling fractions where the system phase separates , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chempot ] for @xmath67 .",
    "we also see from fig .",
    "[ fig : chempot ] that this range shrinks with increasing temperature .",
    "indeed , the system does not separate at all for @xmath107 .",
    "the reason is that the entropy of mixing stabilises the system against phase separation for a non - zero temperature .     as a function of filling fraction @xmath104 for @xmath84 , @xmath105 , and different temperatures .",
    "the solid ( blue ) curve for @xmath67 has the maxwell construction indicated , where the system is unstable towards phase separation for the filling fractions between the vertical dashed lines , and superfluid outside that region .",

    "we now present @xmath67 phase diagrams taking the pairing and phase separation instabilities into account . in fig .",
    "[ fig : heatmap ] , we plot phase diagrams as a function of the filling fraction @xmath104 and the bose - fermi coupling strength @xmath111 for two different values of the bec coherence length : @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",

    "the vertical line at half filling indicates a topological phase transition between a superfluid state with chern number @xmath96 and @xmath98 .",
    "as expected , an increasing coupling strength @xmath111 increases the pairing .",
    "however , it also increases the range of densities where the system phase separates . because of this competition",
    ", it is not simply a matter of increasing @xmath111 in order to increase the pairing .",
    "if the attraction becomes too strong , the system simply phase separates into regions with filling fractions close to @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which strongly suppresses pairing .",
    "instead , one has to tune @xmath111 to an intermediate value to optimise the pairing . for a given @xmath111 , one should choose an average filling fraction @xmath104 in the phase separated region , i.e.  @xmath117 .",
    "the system will then phase separate into two superfluid regions with filling fractions @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which have the same pairing strength .",
    "an important conclusion from fig .",
    "[ fig : heatmap ] is that a smaller coherence length @xmath59 allows one to obtain a larger pairing strength by tuning @xmath120 .",
    "indeed , the maximum value of the pairing one can achieve by tuning @xmath120 is @xmath121 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 with @xmath124 , compared to @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath123 with @xmath127 .",
    "the positions @xmath128 and @xmath129 of the maxima are indicated by the numbered circles for @xmath112 and for @xmath130 in fig .",
    "[ fig : heatmap ] .",
    "the reason that one can achieve a larger pairing for smaller @xmath131 , is that it determines the range of the induced interaction .",
    "since phase separation is mainly driven by long range interactions whereas pairing is mainly driven by the nearest neighbour interactions , a smaller range will suppress pairing less than it suppresses phase separation . as a result of this delicate competition",
    ", a small coherence length effectively favours pairing , since it allows a stronger coupling strength before the system phase separates .",
    "this shows that our proposed system is very useful for realising a topological superfluid in a lattice , since it allows the tuning of both the strength and the range of the induced interaction .",
    "since the fermi system is 2d , the superfluid phase melts via the bkt mechanism  @xcite . in this section",
    ", we calculate the critical temperature @xmath132 of this transition following the approach of ref .",
    "the melting is determined by the phase stiffness of the order parameter , which can be calculated from the free energy cost associated with imposing a phase twist on the system . if the overall phase ( in addition to the @xmath0 phase winding ) of the order parameter changes by a small amount @xmath133 between neighbouring sites along the @xmath134-direction , the corresponding change in the free energy is @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the phase stiffness along the @xmath134-direction .",
    "imposing such a linear phase twist on the system is equivalent to using periodic boundary conditions on a system described by the gauge transformed hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath137 here , @xmath138 is the @xmath134-coordinate of particle @xmath139 and we gauge transform each particle with half the angle @xmath140 , since the order parameter @xmath141 involves two particles . from eq .",
    "( [ stifnessdef ] ) , it is sufficient to calculate the energy shift due to the gauge transformation to second order in @xmath133 to determine the superfluid stiffness .",
    "expanding eq .",
    "( [ gaugetransform ] ) to second order in @xmath133 , and calculating the corresponding corrections to the energy yields after a lengthy but straightforward calculation  @xcite @xmath142 \\label{stifness}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the superfluid stiffness along the @xmath134-direction . here",

    "we find that @xmath146 for @xmath0 pairing .",
    "the critical temperature for the superfluid phase can now be determined by the bkt condition  @xcite @xmath147    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkt ] , we plot the calculated phase stiffness @xmath148 as a function of temperature for the two different parameter sets and shown in fig . [",
    "fig : heatmap ] .",

    "[ fig : heatmap ] .",
    "this condition yields the bkt transition temperatures @xmath150 and @xmath151 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 respectively . in these calculations",
    ", we use that the critical temperature @xmath154 of the bec typically is much larger than @xmath132 , so that we can set @xmath67 when calculating the induced interaction mediated by the bec .",

    "[ fig : heatmap ] .",
    "the critical temperature is determined when @xmath148 crosses the line @xmath149 , which is also plotted . ]",
    "despite the fact that we have used the flexibility of the bose - fermi system to optimise the interaction for topological pairing , the obtained bkt critical temperatures are still fairly low .",
    "the reason is that phase separation in the lattice prohibits the use of too strong interaction , in contrast to the case of a homogenous 2d fermi gas  @xcite .",
    "we note however that the critical temperatures are much higher than for the topological superfluid of dipoles moving in a 2d lattice with the same density  @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to increase the critical temperature by decreasing the bec coherence length even further . but",
    "a coherence length much shorter than the lattice spacing is not experimentally realistic , since it requires a very high density of the bec .",
    "another possibility is to suppress the phase separation instability by increasing the temperature .",
    "unfortunately , we saw from the discussion in connection with fig .",
    "[ fig : chempot ] , that the phase separation instability is essentially unaffected by the low temperatures @xmath155 , since @xmath156 .",
    "since the bose - fermi mixture is a very tunable system compared to other proposals , the fact that we obtain rather low critical temperatures indicates that it will be experimentally challenging to realise a topological superfluid using atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "this should be compared with the similar bose - fermi system without a lattice , where high critical temperatures can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "the advantage however of using an optical lattice is the available schemes for directly detecting the majorana edge states .",
    "current experiments with single site resolution  @xcite could specifically image the edge states using for instance their time - evolution in real space  @xcite or rf spectroscopy  @xcite . intriguingly , we note that since the two phase separated regions with filling fractions @xmath118 and @xmath119 have chern numbers @xmath96 and @xmath98 respectively , there will be topologically robust edge states at the boundary between these two phases .",
    "in this paper , we have analysed the phase diagram of identical fermions in a 2d square lattice immersed in a 3d bec .",
    "the attractive induced interaction between the fermions mediated by the bec was shown to give rise to topological @xmath0 pairing as well as phase separation .",
    "we calculated the phase diagram at zero temperature as a function of the bose - fermi coupling strength and the filling fraction .",
    "the bose - fermi mixture was demonstrated to allow one to maximise topological superfluid pairing by tuning the range of the interaction , so that it favours pairing between nearest neighbour fermions , while long range interaction effects leading to phase separation are suppressed .",
    "we then calculated the bkt critical temperature for the superfluid phase , and we finally discussed the prospect for an experimental realisation of a topological superfluid in the present system .",
