    "global demand for consumption of agricultural crops for food , feed , and fuel is increasing rapidly ( edgerton , 2009 ) . to satisfy the growing worldwide demand ,",
    "one option would be to continue improving plant productivity per surface unit .",
    "however , after decades of increase , slower rates of yield improvement , stagnation or even loss of productivity are presently observed in major crops ( ray _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "this situation is likely imputable to the combination of two concomitant challenges that agriculture is facing : negative effects of global climatic change and pronounced societal demand for limiting agriculture environmental costs or prejudices , for example by reducing the use of chemicals in disease management programs ( sutton , 1996 ) . in this context , it is necessary to continue the genetic improvement of the main crops while at the same time adapting the cultural practices towards sustainable production systems .    in general",
    ", selecting plant traits associated with crop yield improvement is difficult because depending on the specific environment where the crop is grown , a number of trade - offs occurs , with often compensating effects when scaling up from plant to crop level ( sinclair _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) .",
    "the experimental effort to identify important traits is tremendous due to the numerous possible genotype x environment combinations that would need to be tested .",
    "moreover , in the case of pluriannual crops , collecting data repetitively over years is practicable neither on complex phenotypes nor at fine scales . to save time , labor and resources and to make the investigation on crop performance possible ,",
    "approaches based on modeling to implement computer - based experiments have recently emerged ( da silva _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014__b _ _ ; casadebaig _ et al .",
    "_ , 2015 ; martre _ et al .",
    "_ , 2015__a _",
    "this strategy is made possible thanks to the development over the past two decades of a number of simulation models , based on mathematical equations representing various biological processes in relation to plant growth and development as a function of environment ( climate , soil and management ) and a number of genotype - dependent parameters .",
    "those parameters are expected to be more heritable than complex traits , less prone to genotype x environment interactions and to have a less complex genetic architecture ( heslot _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ) .",
    "they represent a range of functional traits , i.e any morphological , physiological , phenological or behavioural features measurable at the individual level ( violle _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) . in this case ,",
    "simulation is a tool to predict trait x trait and trait x environment interactions when upscaling from plant traits to the crop level .    depending on their structure ,",
    "those models can be referred to as _ process - based crop models _ or _ structural - functional plant models_. the first ones are defined at the plot scale , often without an explicit representation of the individuals and focus on predicting crop performance , mainly harvestable organs yield or quality .",
    "small differences in the physiological framework ( e.g radiation - based or water - based biomass production ) lead to different families of worldwide - used process - based model ( ritchie and otter , 1985 ; keating _ et al . _ , 2003 ; brisson _ et al . _ , 2003 ; stockle _ et al . _ , 2003 ) .",
    "such models are used in an increasing number of studies to explore the genotype x environment landscape and assist breeding programs to take advantage of genetic and environmental resources more efficiently ( e.g. chapman _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; hammer _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ; jeuffroy _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ) . in functional - structural plant models , the plant structure ( i.e.  its topology and geometry ) as well as a number of functions allowing the plant to interact with its environment ( i.e.  light interception , photosynthesis , carbon allocation , etc",
    ". ) are more explicitly represented ( dejong _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ) .",
    "depending on the objectives , such models focus on representing the structure ( e.g. , trunk and wood , nikinmaa _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) and its development ( fournier and andrieu , 1999 ; costes _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ; lopez _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) , and the fruit development ( allen _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) .",
    "the concept of _ ideotype _ has been proposed as the idealized appearance of a plant phenotype , `` a biological model which is expected to perform or behave in a predictable manner within a defined environment '' ( donald , 1968 ) .",
    "while a plant phenotype is defined as the expression of its genotype in a particular environment through functional traits , an ideotype could be defined as an ideal combination of traits optimizing crop performances under given biophysical environments and crop management .",
    "this definition provides the breeder with a guide for cultivar characterization , to search for particular features in progenies .",
    "model - assisted phenotyping and ideotype design is a research domain with recent developments ( martre _ et al . _ , 2015__b _ _ ) .",
    "it can be formulated as an optimization problem of model inputs related to plant traits ( quilot - turion _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; semenov and stratonovitch , 2013 ; da silva _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014__b _ _ ; semenov _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ) , allelic combinations ( e.g. letort _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) or management practices ( grechi _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; wu _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "different purposes are targeted with these approaches such as the adaptation to climate change ( semenov and stratonovitch , 2013 ; semenov _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014 ) or the multicriterion assessment of cultivar ( qi _ et al .",
    "_ , 2010 ; quilot - turion _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "despite observing correlation in traits used as inputs in simulation models ( e.g earliness at flowering and vegetative development ) , correlations are not formally considered in current ideotype design approaches based on trait optimization .",
    "consequently , failing to account for trait correlations can lead to numerical experiments less grounded in biological reality and ultimately impossibilities for the breeder to develop cultivars based on the designed ideotypes .",
    "these correlations are observed at the phenotypic level , thus resulting from differences in the variances and covariances at the genetic ( g ) and environmental ( e ) level ( and their interactions , gxe ) or to correlations between consecutive years or branching orders in perennial plants ( segura _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "multi - environmental trials allow separating the variance and covariance components for g , e and gxe . however",
    ", such process is generally based on the simplistic assumption that covariance structure for e does not depend on the genotype , and vice versa .    here , we propose a notion of _ feasibility _ , that can be viewed as the probability to extract progenies having the expected ideotype from the cross between given genitors thanks to the meiosis .",
    "the distribution of a trait thus reflects its dispersion and the possibility of its selection , with many individuals close to the mean value of the progeny and some individuals having more extreme phenotypes than their parents ( heterosis or transgressive traits ) . in this perspective",
    ", some trait associations may be unlikely due to negative and antagonistic correlation between traits , possibly resulting from physiological antagonisms .",
    "on the contrary , some traits may be difficult to dissociate because of a lack of genetic recombinants due to close positions of their respective key genes along the genome ( linkage ) .",
    "in addition , several genes may interact thus having a joined effect on a given trait ( epistasis ) or one gene may have an effect on several traits simultaneously ( pleiotropy ) .",
    "the architecture of variances and correlations between traits reflects the feasibility to select traits jointly with an expected genetic gain from their combination .    in our approach",
    ", we defined a feasibility criterion based on the observed joint distribution of the traits used as model parameters as a possible answer to improve the realism of ideotype design .",
    "introducing real data is a solution to control optimization process , in a way similar to data assimilation for dynamic models which can be used to improve predictions . in an operational point of view",
    ", we focus on _ empirical _ correlations observed at the plant level ( grown at agronomic plant populations ) and aforementioned distinctions between genetic and environmental variances are not considered in this work .",
    "indeed , due to the sample size , these empirical , phenotypic correlations were expected to be more robust .",
    "the present work will consider two use cases to design realistic and efficients plant ideotypes : the apple tree orchard and the sunflower crop .",
    "the study will rely on two numerical models : a functional - structural plant model of the apple tree ( mapplet , costes _",
    "et al . _ , 2008 ) and a process - based model for the sunflower crop ( sunflo , casadebaig _ et al . _ , 2011 ; lecoeur _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ) .",
    "additionally , the two cases target different steps of the breeding process , considering different sources for genetic variability : ( 1 ) upstream for apple tree , as we use a segregating population to screen for ideotypes and ( 2 ) downstream for sunflower , as we use a collection of released cultivars . for both cases , we will use a unified multi - objective optimization formulation to solve the ideotyping problem using a metric of performance returned by the numerical model and the introduced metric of feasibility based on observations . while the main objective of our approach was to improve the realism of model - based ideotype design , no modification of the simulation models was required : the approach we propose is therefore suitable to different types of simulation models ( process - based , functional structural ,  ) or input data .",
    "section _ material and methods _ presents the two models , the associated research problem and the available data on existing phenotypes .",
    "the multi - objective approach is described in section _ phenotype optimization _ along with",
    "the optimization algorithms used to solve the problem .",
    "the section _",
    "results _ describes the feasibility criterion for each use case , and the set of ideotypes obtained by optimization .",
    "finally , we discuss the results in terms of morphological and physiological characteristics of the ideotypes , and discuss the links between our feasibility criterion and genetic material .",
    "in the apple tree , breeding programs mainly focused so far on major traits such as disease resistance and fruit quality , even though other traits such as the regularity of bearing , an optimized distribution of fruit in the canopy were considered highly desirable ( lespinasse _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ; laurens _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) . for apple tree , dwarfed spur - types have been proposed as ideotype for high density orchard ( dickmann _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ) despite the spurred habit being generally associated with biennial bearing ( looney and lane , 1984 ) , whereas weeping apple trees have been preferred for low - input regular bearing tree because they were considered prone to regular bearing ( lespinasse _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ) .",
    "more recently , new criteria linked to the adaptation to climatic changes have been proposed , mainly regarding the tree architecture ( leaf area , branching ) , phenology ( flowering , vegetative shoot and fruit maturation ) and the tree tolerance to periods of water deprivation during the growing season .",
    "the architecture of a tree determines the 3d foliage distribution and consequently the light interception efficiency , thereby having impact on water transport and transpiration as well as carbon acquisition and allocation ( costes _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) . for these reasons",
    ", the improvement of light penetration within tree canopies has been a constant objective of training systems conception ( lauri , 2002 ) .",
    "the optimization of tree architecture could be achieved through genetics and breeding to complement and eventually reduce human intervention .",
    "ideally , the within - species genetic variability could be used for defining ideotypes and plant breeding .",
    "however , it remains difficult to integrate architectural traits in breeding programs due to the complex changes in trait values during tree development ( laurens _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "there exist few methods to quantify and objectively compare the impact of training systems or cultivars on light interception efficiency , if we exclude digitizing which relies on hard and time consuming field measurements .",
    "moreover , the complexity of fruit tree structure , the large number of trees required for experiments in quantitative genetics , as well as their long growth period makes it difficult to use real trees for exploring the link between the genetic variation of tree architecture and light interception throughout tree development .    in this context , mapplet appeared as a new tool for exploring in silico large ranges of tree geometries and topologies .",
    "initially parameterized for fuji cultivar , mapplet was used in virtual experiments in which apple trees were simulated and coupled with m@xmath0slim , i.e.  multiscale lightinterception model , which is a model capable of combining detailed and statistical description of foliage at different scales to estimate radiation attenuation ( da silva _ et al . _ , 2008 ) .",
    "_ in silico _ explorations of different combinations of geometrical and topological traits and their consequences on light interception , considered as one of the key parameters to optimize fruit tree production , were performed ( han _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; da silva _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014__a__,_b _ ) .",
    "mapplet is a functional - structural plant model that simulates apple tree development over years , considering both topology and geometry in interaction with the environment , in the present case gravity ( costes _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) . in mapplet",
    ", the growth and branching processes are simulated with markov chains and hidden semi - markov chains , respectively , estimated on previously collected data set ( costes and gudon , 2002 ; costes _ et al . _ , 2003 ; renton _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) .",
    "at the macro scale , the growth units ( gu ) are represented by four states depending on their length ( _ long _ , _ medium _ , _ short _ and _ floral _ ) , which succession is modeled by a markov chain , which parameters consist in initial and transition probabilities and observation distributions ( see costes and gudon ( 2002 ) for details ) . at the phytomer scale , the branching structures of long and medium gu are characterized with zones , each zone being characterized by a specific mixture of laterals . the succession of these zones is modeled with a hidden semi - markov chain ( hsmc ) which parameters depend on the parent shoot length ( renton _ et al .",
    ". in this case parameters consist ( i ) in initial and transition probabilities and ( ii ) parameters of occupancy and observation distributions .    for geometrical development ,",
    "the branch bending is supported by a biomechanical model ( almras , 2001 ; taylor - hell , 2005 ) , where the torques imposed by gravity and phototropism are applied to each internode and then recursively extended to the entire axis , taking into account the intra - year dynamics of primary , secondary and fruit growth .",
    "the biomechanics model uses as input organ weight , issuing from organ growth functions , diameters issuing from the pipe model and a young s modulus .",
    "the simulation of secondary ( cambial ) growth is supported by the pipe model ( shinozaki _ et al .",
    "_ , 1964 ) , thereby the internode widths are eventually accumulated from the diameters of the corresponding distal ends ( including the apical meristems and the leaf petioles )",
    ". each organ geometry results from a normalized logistic function with three to five parameters ( see da silva _ et al . _",
    "( 2014__a _ _ ) for details ) .",
    "the model also includes parameters such as phyllotaxic and branching angle .",
    "outputs consist of 3d mock - ups and multi - scale tree graphs ( mtg , godin and caraglio , 1998 ) representing the progression of tree form and topology over time .",
    "the model was first assessed by comparing those descriptors between simulated and digitized trees ( costes _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "following previous investigations ( han _ et al . _ , 2012 ; da silva _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014__a _",
    "_ ) , we decided to focus on four key geometrical traits : branching angle ( ba ) , internode length ( il ) , top shoot diameter ( tsd ) and leaf area ( la ) .",
    "we defined the performance metric as the projected leaf area ( pla ) for five - year - old trees .",
    "these traits were chosen because of their assumed influence on the leaf 3d distribution and therefore on light interception .",
    "since petiole angles are constant in the current version of mapplet , the leaf orientation was assumed to be mainly influenced by branching angle and branch bending .",
    "the latter depends , for a given wood elasticity , on the weights imposed by leaves and internodes along an axis .",
    "according to the pipe model , the internode widths are recursively accumulated from the diameters of corresponding distal ends , from the shoot top to the shoot base .",
    "so the top shoot diameter is also expected to have an impact on branch bending and consequently on leaf spatial distribution .",
    "internode length , which determines the intervals between leaves , may impact leaf density and the branching of the canopy .",
    "finally , the area of individual leaf is , along with the number of leaves , a major component of the total interception surface of the tree .",
    "however , not all leaf area captures light and the projected leaf area allows accounting for the overlaps and mutual shading of leaves in the canopy .",
    "topological variables are not considered in this study : hence , the topology is constant over all geometries ( in practice , this is achieved by using the same markov chains samples for all trees ) . to avoid drawing conclusions specific to a particular configuration , the performance is taken as the mean over three well - distinct topologies . in summary , denoting @xmath1 the topologies , the performance can be defined as :    @xmath2    with @xmath3 .",
    "the genotype - dependent parameters were obtained by measuring 123 apple tree hybrids issued from the biparental cross between ` starkrimson ' and ` granny smith ' .",
    "these 123 apple tree phenotypes were planted and measured during several years in an experiment reported in segura _",
    "( 2008 ) , providing us with a dataset of 6,150 trees and 123 average measures of the four geometrical traits on different individuals .",
    "the intervals of variation for each trait are reported in table 1 .",
    "the min and max values for the four studied parameters correspond to the min and max values observed within the progeny . for reference ,",
    "those extremes can be compared to the parameters for the fuji cultivar : 45 for ba , 0.03 for il , 0.003 for tsd and la .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table 4 : four optimal phenotypes for sunflo . *",
    "our approach allowed to virtually recombine plant traits , starting from phenotypes measured in existing populations to finally obtain a set of optimal phenotypes maximizing performance and feasibility ( figure 3 , tables 3 - 4 ) .",
    "this result is first discussed from a biological perspective , i.e the morphological and physiological characteristics in the optimal set of phenotypes , for the apple - tree and sunflower use - cases .",
    "we then discuss the influence of the input dataset on the outcome of our approach and how the feasibility criterion could be defined in relation with the type of genetic material ( e.g rils or hybrids ) .",
    "finally , we discuss how such a multi - objective optimization method is a less data - intensive alternative compared to emergent molecular breeding methods such as genomic selection or gene - based modeling to estimate the breeding value of plant phenotypes .      considering both apple and sunflower use - cases , the performance : feasibility optimization approach resulted in _ paths _ of improvement that can be used in trait - based breeding ( figure 5b and 5d ) .",
    "such paths could be followed to target values of the most promising traits , while indicating when modifications would yield an unlikely plant phenotype , based on traits covariance .      for the branching angle ( ba )",
    ", values close to 2/3 in the range of variation explored ( table 1 ) appeared as both the most feasible and the optimum ( table 3 . ) .",
    "this value corresponded approximately to 80 from the vertical and to opened branches .",
    "moreover , due to branch bending , such a basal branching angle will lead to even higher top branching angle .",
    "no real improvement can be expected for this trait since there was no increase in the performance value associated to its variation ( figures 5a and 5b ) .",
    "this results is consistent with more erected trees with low branch angles would be less efficient to capture light , probably due to higher leaf overlaps ( da silva _ et al . _ , 2014__b _ _ ) .",
    "in contrast , large increase in performance can be expected from an increase in internode length , leaf area and top shoot diameter ( table 3 , figures 5a and 5b ) .",
    "a particular behavior was observed for internode length variation since the maximum value in the explored range was reached before the maximum performance .",
    "this indicated that internodes longer than 5 cm could increase light interception .",
    "however , in addition to being less feasible , these extreme phenotypes could be instable in a biomechanics point of view and the corresponding shoots are likely to be unable to support apple fruit weight ( almras and fournier , 2009 ) .",
    "such limitation was observed for internode length only whereas higher leaf area and top shoot diameter were continuously associated to higher performance ( figure 5b ) .",
    "this suggested that values higher than those considered could be explored for higher light interception , despite such phenotypes would be associated with low feasibility ( table 3 . ) . the increase in performance obtained with an increase in top shoot diameter was less rapid than with leaf area .",
    "this suggests that exploring values far from the presently explored range could lead to significant performance improvement , here viewed as light interception .",
    "finally , the optimal phenotypes designed by the present approach exhibit characteristics quite different from those of the fuji variety used in the initial version of mapplet ( costes _ et al . _ , 2008 ; da silva _ et al .",
    "_ , 2014__b _ _ ) .",
    "indeed , more opened branching angles , longer internodes and higher leaf areas were preferred for optimizing light interception .",
    "the values of two traits ( lls and le ) out of the eight considered were nearly constant in the optimal set of solutions ( figure 5c ) , indicating that once fixed to their optimal values , these traits had no impact in the performance : feasibility trade - off ( figure 3b ) .",
    "the designed sunflower ideotype for the considered growth environments had a below than average potential individual leaf area ( @xmath4 in table 4 ) whose expansion is more sensible to water deficit ( @xmath5 in table 4 ) , compared to the population of phenotyped hybrids . for these two traits , the convergence towards a fixed value indicated that they were central for the cultivar adaptation in the sampled environments : any modifications in these traits would lead to sub - optimal solutions ( either in performance or feasibility ) .",
    "on the other hand , the modification of the six remaining traits actually had an impact in the performance : feasibility trade - off of the ideotypes ( i.e.  important slopes in figure 5d ; table 4 ) .",
    "the most efficient ideotype had a late maturity date ( tdm3 ) and mid - late flowering date ( tdf1 ) .",
    "its aerial architecture was defined by a low leaf number ( tln ) , a symmetric leaf profile ( llh ) and a low extinction coefficient ( k ) . a sensitive control of the stomatal conductance ( tr )",
    "was also found to be an important characteristic , i.e the stomatal conductance starts to decline for a moderate water deficit .",
    "however , these optimal characteristics were found to be hard to obtain , at least for maturity and control of stomatal conductance , as their values were out of the @xmath6 $ ] feasibility range .",
    "interestingly , even if the environments we used for testing had an important soil water capacity , the characteristics of the designed ideotype depicted a plant rather adapted to water deficit : a moderate leaf area and light extinction and adaptative traits ( le , tr ) .",
    "these characteristics lead to water efficient plants , with a lower water loss due to transpiration ; either because the leaf area is lower or because transpiration rate is reduced under water deficit ( higher le value ) .",
    "as the aim of this study was to focus on the definition of a feasibility criterion in a multi - objective optimization approach , we have chosen not to consider a large target population of environments . however , considering more diverse environmental and management factors would probably affect the characteristics of the optimal set of ideotypes , eventually leading to ideotypes linked to specific growth conditions . in this case , we could assume that few key traits are responsible for the cultivar global adaptation capacity whereas secondary traits support alternative resource use strategies that are needed to adapt to uncertain environmental conditions .",
    "* is the feasibility function a reasonable representation of the biologic reality ? *",
    "our feasibility function is entirely dependent of the dataset at hand , which implies that the diversity of phenotypes selected by the optimization process results from the traits variance in the population .",
    "this variance corresponds to genetic variability ( collection of hybrids ) or heterosis ( bi - parental progeny ) , in which case it also depends on parents chosen for crossing .",
    "on the one hand , polymorphism , i.e.  the existence of several alleles at a locus , increases the capacity to obtain diverse phenotypic traits . on the other hand",
    ", the genetic distance between parents will also impact this capacity , more distant parents increasing the differences between alleles .    in our study ,",
    "the variation considered in the apple tree case resulted from a biparental segregating population with low relatedness of the parents ( segura _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "a larger distribution of the traits , and possibly different correlations could be expected from different crosses or in populations with increased genetic diversity , such as multi - parental populations ( bink _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ; blanc _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) and core collections ( lassois _ et al . _ , 2016 ) .",
    "in the sunflower case , the observed variability in the traits resulted from the upstream selection of the commercial hybrids and the variability in this material probably only covers a narrow portion of the diversity present in core collections .",
    "as we have no kinship information on this material we can assume that average values for each trait are considered as the most feasible , which is reflected by our definition of the feasibility function ( maximum at the center of the cloud and smallest values at the edges of the domain ) . if other plant material would be used , with more complex genetic structure , it would be necessary to account for kinship matrix in a way comparable to pedigree - based ( bink _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) or gwas analyses",
    ". this would allow accounting for genetic correlations between individuals in addition to correlations between traits as presently proposed",
    ".    more generally , our approach could benefit from defining the feasibility function according to the type of the genetic material screened in the optimization process . in the proposed function ( eq .",
    "5 ) , the proximity of a virtual phenotype to a particular existing individual will only indirectly be accounted for . in the sunflower case , because the breeding process actually produced those hybrids , an alternative feasibility function could be defined that would reach its maximum at those particular trait combinations ( figure 6 ) . in this case , virtual phenotypes that would match existing one would be more present in optimal solutions , even if they are farther from the population mean .",
    "we did not conduct such tests because it was not central in our proof of concept study .",
    "however , the global approach and optimization algorithm would support alternative feasibility functions without modifications .",

    "_ , 2014 ) or even predictors computed from simulation modeling ( technow _ et al .",
    "_ , 2015 ) .",
    "additionally , phenotypes measured in the training population for genomic selection could also be used to estimate a feasibility function based on observed correlations between traits , similarly to our approach .",
    "this function is likely to improve the accuracy of the genomic selection model for estimating breeding values in the next generation ( e.g. marulanda _ et al .",
    "_ , 2015 ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , gene - based modeling ( white and hoogenboom , 2003 ; yin _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) , where gene or qtl action is represented through linear effects of specific alleles on crop simulation model parameters ( messina _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ; chenu _ et al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) , intrinsically accounts for feasibility at the expense of an intensive phenotyping ( i.e.  on large populations ) and modeling step , i.e.  to develop genetic models for all influent genotype - dependent parameters of the simulation model .",
    "consequently , gene - to - phenotype predictions can be improved to account for gene x environment interactions either by ( 1 ) augmenting genomic selection frameworks with new types of predictors or ( 2 ) relying on numerical models and optimization methods to identify optimal combinations of traits ( or alleles , depending on the input type ) .",
    "we suggest that our approach fit in the second option , and can improve the realism of ideotypes designed with model - based optimization methods while requiring marginally less phenotyping work as compared to the gene - based modeling option ; i.e.  the measurement of traits ( crop - model parameters ) on a given genetic material to estimate the feasibility criteria .",
    "crop simulations models are powerful tools to ease ideotype design , whether for their ability to perform large scale experiments or for the possibility they offer to explore a large variety of trait combinations . however , as stated in ( martre _ et al .",
    "_ , 2015__b _",
    "_ ) , an essential question of the approaches proposed for optimizing the genetic parameters is the lack of integration of genetic constraints on virtual cultivar , which can lead to impossibilities for the breeder to produce them .",
    "+ we argue that introducing the use of correlations between genetic parameters into a feasibility criterion , which is not formally considered in current approaches , is an efficient way of increasing realism in model - based ideotype design approaches .",
    "relying on multi - objective optimization allowed us to explore the space of potential phenotypes , while targeting this exploration to realistic trait combinations and avoiding misleading solutions . + here",
    ", we provided a proof of concept study for this approach and showed that it could provide trait - based breeding methods with paths describing desirable and realistic trait modifications ( both in direction and intensity ) .",
