    "circular rydberg states ( @xmath6 ) have attracted attention in the past two decades , in part because the transitions among these states are resonant with typical modes of microwave cavities .",
    "a convenient mechanism for the preparation of these states has been described in  @xcite . when coupled to the modes of a microwave cavity , the metastable rydberg atoms undergo rabi oscillations , leading to a direct verification of the concept of field quantization  @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the resonant cavity to the rydberg atom can be used for the generation of entangled einstein ",
    "rosen pairs of atoms  @xcite .",
    "a further field of interest has been the theoretical simulation of atomic non - dispersive wave packets , which can be realized with the `` assistance '' of a background laser field with a specific `` kepler '' frequency ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this partial list of applications is supplemented here by an investigation of relativistic and radiative effects in highly - excited hydrogenic states , without any consideration of the additional interaction with a cavity .",
    "the electron density of circular rydberg states ( @xmath7 ) resembles kepler circular orbits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , the characteristic shape of wave function is restricted to the maximum-@xmath8 subcomponent ( see also fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . for states with nonmaximal @xmath9 ,",
    "the shape of the electron density is manifestly different . for all circular rydberg states ,",
    "the wave function is spread out considerably in comparison to lower states , on a length scale of @xmath10 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath11 is the radial coordinate , @xmath12 is the bohr radius and @xmath2 is the ( high ) principal quantum number .",
    "relativistic and radiative effects in rydberg atoms allow for a simultaneous perspective on four different physical regimes : _ relativistic _ and _ qed radiative _ effects in the transition in the borderline region between _ classical _ and _ quantum _ physics .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned reasons for studying rydberg atoms , the current paper is also inspired by a recently completed analysis of radiative corrections for laser - dressed states  @xcite . in  @xcite , an experimental setup based on the hydrogen @xmath13@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) transition",
    "is discussed in detail . a coherent - wave light source with the appropriate frequency",
    "has recently become available  @xcite . because the @xmath13 ground state is fully stable against radiative ( spontaneous ) decay , the incoherent atomic fluorescence ( in the case of the @xmath13@xmath14 transition ) is described to excellent accuracy by the mollow spectrum  @xcite .",
    "a further promising setup for studying the laser - dressed lamb shift would be provided by a transition from the metastable @xmath16 state to a high-@xmath2 ( rydberg ) @xmath4 state .",
    "rydberg states have a small radiative decay width , which would facilitate the observation of the predicted dynamic corrections to the lamb shift  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the frequency required for the excitation process @xmath17 ( high @xmath2 ) is smaller and therefore _ a priori _ less problematic to realize experimentally than the @xmath13@xmath14 transition . in the formalism of  @xcite",
    ", the self - energy correction analyzed here contributes to the lamb shift of `` bare '' atomic levels ; this contribution is an essential part of the laser - dressed lamb shift , which may be observed in incoherent light scattering by hydrogenlike atoms .",
    "another motivation for the current work is to find actual values of the bethe logarithms for highly - excited states , since the bethe logarithm gives a significant contribution to radiative level shifts .",
    "this is true of hydrogenlike , as well as heliumlike  @xcite and lithiumlike  @xcite systems .",
    "one of the most extensive systematic studies  @xcite of hydrogenic ( one - loop ) bethe logarithms currently available in the literature extends only up to @xmath18 , and only approximate values are available for higher excited circular rydberg states  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is of interest to study the asymptotics of quantum electrodynamic corrections as a function of the quantum numbers .",
    "such results can for instance be useful in comparing different calculational approaches to these corrections , and for obtaining general expressions valid for arbitrary quantum numbers within a specific manifold of states .",
    "certain asymptotic structures have recently been conjectured for radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of highly - excited ( bare ) atomic states is motivated by recent experiments : e.g. , in  @xcite , the evaluation of self energies of circular states of orbital quantum number @xmath19 was required .",
    "the consideration of quantum electrodynamic corrections for highly - excited states is also relevant , in part , to the analysis of quantum electrodynamic corrections to dielectronic recombination resonances  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we thus study radiative corrections for highly excited hydrogenic states .",
    "specifically , after recalling basic facts about relativistic corrections in sec .  [ subsec1 ] , we proceed to the study of radiative effects in secs .",
    "[ subsec2 ] and  [ subsec3 ] , with an emphasis on the radiative decay width of circular states in sec .",
    "[ subsec3 ] .",
    "the main part of the investigation reported here is contained in  [ subsec4 ] , where a numerical calculation of bethe logarithms for highly and very highly excited circular states is described ( see table  [ table1 ] below ) .",
    "this investigation then leads to the asymptotic formulas for bethe logarithms which yield a relative accuracy of @xmath20 or better , for general states within a specified manifold .",
    "the self - energy corrections studied in sec .  [ subsec4 ] are the by far dominant radiative corrections for circular rydberg states .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "this paper follows the usual convention for hydrogenic quantum numbers : the principal quantum number is denoted by  @xmath2 , the orbital angular momentum by  @xmath21 and the total electron angular momentum by  @xmath22 . as is customary in the literature , @xmath23 denotes the nuclear charge number of the hydrogenlike ion under consideration , and @xmath24 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "natural units ( @xmath25 ) are used throughout the text .",
    "we briefly recall some basic facts about relativistic corrections to highly - excited states in hydrogenlike systems .",
    "the numerical values of the coefficients multiplying the relativistic corrections of order @xmath26 are typically small for high-@xmath2 states . in order to illustrate this point , we briefly recall the expansion of the dirac bound - state energy in a hydrogenlike system in powers of @xmath27 up to order @xmath28 ( see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ? * eq .  ( 2 - 87 ) ) ) : @xmath29   + { \\cal o}(z\\alpha)^6\\,.\\ ] ] the @xmath28-term is the dominant relativistic correction for low-@xmath23 hydrogenlike systems and is responsible , in particular , for the fine structure . by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ enj ] ) , we infer that for circular states ( which have @xmath30 ) , the @xmath28-term scales as @xmath31 , which contrasts with the familiar @xmath32-scaling valid for fixed  @xmath22 .",
    "as we will see below , _ radiative _ corrections in rydberg states also tend to display faster asymptotic behaviors ( in  @xmath2 ) than states with a fixed angular momentum .      in this article , we study radiative effects in highly - excited hydrogenic energy levels .",
    "our focus is on the self - energy and the radiative lifetime . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the self - energy and the radiative lifetime are intimately related to each other .",
    "namely , the radiative lifetime of a hydrogenic state is proportional to the imaginary part of the expectation value of that state @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the renormalized self - energy operator discussed in ch .  7 of  @xcite , and @xmath35 is the relativistic ( dirac ) wave function .",
    "the self - energy is just the real part of @xmath33 and leads to the familiar shift of the energy levels .",
    "as is well known , the real part of the one - loop self - energy shift @xmath36 may be written as @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is a dimensionless quantity , and the the notation @xmath39 follows the usual spectroscopic characterization of the hydrogenic state  @xmath35 .",
    "it is customary in the literature to suppress the dependence of @xmath40 on the quantum numbers @xmath2 , @xmath22 and @xmath21 and write @xmath41 for @xmath38 .",
    "the decay width @xmath42 is the reciprocal of the lifetime @xmath43 and is given by @xmath44 for states with the same angular momentum quantum numbers , the decay rate decreases with @xmath2 approximately as @xmath32 , and the lifetime correspondingly goes as @xmath45 ( see ref .",
    "this is also manifest in the definition  ( [ eseasf ] ) of the scaled self - energy function @xmath38 , the structure of which reflects the usual , familiar scaling of the effect with @xmath2 ( for fixed @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .      to a good approximation ,",
    "the lifetime of a highly - excited hydrogenic state does not depend on the spin of the electron , and it is only the principal quantum number and the orbital angular momentum which enter into the leading - order ( nonrelativistic ) expression for the decay rate of excited hydrogenic states .",
    "we denote the ( leading - order ) decay width of a state with principal quantum number  @xmath2 and orbital angular momentum  @xmath21 by the symbol @xmath46 . here , we are particularly interested in states with @xmath47 , and our goal is to study the dependence of the lifetime on the bound - state quantum numbers . for the manifold of states with @xmath47 , based on the formalism introduced in  @xcite , we obtain the following general expression ,    @xmath48 & = &   \\label{firstterms } \\frac{2\\alpha}{3}\\ , \\frac{(z\\alpha)^4 m}{n^5 }   \\times \\left\\ { 1 +   \\frac{1}{n } +   \\frac{7}{8 n^2 } +   \\frac{35}{48 n^3 } \\right .",
