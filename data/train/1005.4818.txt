    "a crucial point in the study of astrophysical dynamos is to understand the mechanism by which they saturate .",
    "nevertheless , a consistent description of this process has rarely been considered in mean - field dynamo ( mfd ) modeling and only a heuristic description is often used .",
    "an important phenomenon happens when the dynamo operates in closed or periodic domains : the turbulent contribution to the dynamo equation , i.e. , the @xmath1 effect , decreases for large values of the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "this process is known as catastrophic quenching and can pose a problem in explaining the generation of magnetic field in late type stars like the sun or the galaxy , where @xmath2 could be of the order of @xmath6 or @xmath7 , respectively",
    ".    in the last few years the nature of the catastrophic quenching has been identified as a consequence of magnetic helicity conservation ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "it has been found that in the nonlinear phase of the dynamo process , conservation of magnetic helicity gives rise to a magnetic @xmath1 effect ( @xmath8 ) with a sign opposite to the inductive contribution due to the helical motions , i.e. , the kinematic @xmath1 effect .",
    "as the production of @xmath8 depends on @xmath2 , the final value of the magnetic field should also follow the same dependence . however , real astrophysical bodies are not closed systems , but they have open boundaries that may allow a flux of magnetic helicity .",
    "the shedding of magnetic helicity may mitigate the catastrophic @xmath1 quenching .",
    "these ideas have been tested in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) in both local cartesian and global spherical domains . in the former @xcite",
    "it has been clearly shown that open boundaries ( e.g.  vertical field boundary conditions ) lead to a faster saturation of a large - scale magnetic field compared with cases in closed domains ( perfect conductor or triple - periodic boundary conditions ) . in the latter , it has been found that it is possible to build up large - scale magnetic fields either with forced turbulence @xcite or with convectively driven turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models generally used vertical field boundary conditions .    in flux - transport dynamos @xcite as well as in interface dynamos of the solar cycle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) the quenching mechanism has been considered either through an _",
    "ad hoc _ algebraic equation or by phenomenological considerations @xcite , but most of the time the models do not consider the effects of magnetic helicity conservation .",
    "an exception is the recent paper by @xcite , where these effects have been considered in the context of an interface dynamo .    in general",
    "the magnetic helicity depends on time , so it is necessary to solve an additional dynamical equation for the contribution of the small - scale field to the magnetic helicity together with the induction equation for the magnetic field . in the past few years",
    ", some effort has already been made to consider this dynamical saturation mechanism in mfd models like in the 1d @xmath9 dynamo models presented in @xcite , in axisymmetric models in cylindrical geometry for the galactic @xmath10 dynamo @xcite , and also in models with spherical geometry for an @xmath9 dynamo @xcite .",
    "the role of various kinds of magnetic helicity fluxes have been explored in several papers @xcite .",
    "our ultimate goal is to develop a self - consistent mfd model of the solar dynamo , with observed velocity profiles and turbulent dynamo coefficients computed from the dns .",
    "this is a task that requires intensive efforts .",
    "hence we shall proceed step by step , starting with simple models and then including more realistic physics on the way . in this work we will study the effects of magnetic helicity conservation in simplified @xmath10 dynamo models for a considerable number of cases .",
    "more importantly , we shall perform our calculations in spherical geometry , which is appropriate for describing stellar dynamos , with suitable boundary conditions , and considering shear profiles which are a simplified version of the observed solar differential rotation .",
    "we shall also explore how magnetic helicity fluxes affect the properties of the solution .",
    "two classes of fluxes are considered in this paper : a diffusive flux and a shear - driven or vishniac - cho ( hereafter vc ) flux @xcite .",
    "we consider models with either radial or latitudinal shear .",
    "the effects of meridional circulation will be investigated in detail in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec.aodyn ] we describe the basic mathematical formalism of the @xmath0 dynamo , give the formulation of the equation for @xmath8 and also justify the fluxes included . in section  [ sec.model ]",
    "we describe the numerical method and then , we present our results in section  [ sec.results ] starting from a dynamo model with algebraic quenching to models with dynamical @xmath1 quenching and different fluxes . finally , we provide a summary of this work in section  [ sec.conc ] .",
    "in mean - field dynamo theory , the evolution of the magnetic field is described by the mean - field induction equation , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the mean magnetic and velocity fields , respectively , @xmath14 is the molecular diffusivity , @xmath15 is the mean electromotive force obtained using a closure theory like the first order smoothing approximation , where @xmath16 gives the contribution of the small - scale components on the large - scale field , @xmath1 is the non - diffusive contribution of the turbulence , @xmath17 is the turbulent magnetic diffusivity , @xmath18 is the mean current density , and @xmath19 is the vacuum permeability .    in spherical coordinates and under the assumption of axisymmetry , it is possible to split the magnetic and the velocity fields into their azimuthal and poloidal components , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we shall not consider the meridional component of the flow , i.e.  @xmath22 .",
    "then , the toroidal and poloidal components of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) may be written as @xmath23_{\\phi }   + \\eta d^2b\\ ; , \\quad , \\\\   \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial t } & \\!=\\ ! & \\alpha b + \\eta d^2a\\ ; , \\label{eq.ina}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the diffusion operator , @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the distance from the axis , and @xmath27 is the poloidal field .",
    "the two source terms in equations ( [ eq.inb ] ) and ( [ eq.ina ] ) , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , express the inductive effects of shear and turbulence , respectively . the relative importance of these two effects may be quantified through the non - dimensional dynamo numbers : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the angular velocity different between top and bottom of the domain .",
    "note that equations ( [ eq.inb ] ) and ( [ eq.ina ] ) are valid only in the limit @xmath33 , known as @xmath0 dynamo .",
    "the inductive effects of the shear may be understood as the stretching of the magnetic field lines due to the change in the angular velocity between two adjacent points .",
    "on the other hand , the kinematic @xmath1-effect is the consequence of helical motions of the plasma which produce screw - like motions in the rising blobs of the magnetic field . using the first order smoothing approximation it",
    "may be expressed as : @xmath34 where , @xmath35 is the correlation time of the turbulent motions and @xmath36 is the small - scale vorticity .",
    "the saturation value of the magnetic field may be obtained by multiplying @xmath37 by the quenching function @xmath38 , which saturates the exponential growth of the magnetic field at values close to the equipartition field strength given by @xmath39 .",
    "this form of algebraic quenching was introduced heuristically ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has been often used as the standard quenching mechanism in many dynamo simulations .",
    "however , it does not give information about the back reaction process and is independent of any parameter of the system like the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "a consistent description of the quenching mechanism will be presented in the following section .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that when the amplitude of the magnetic field reaches values near the equipartition , the @xmath1-effect is modified by a magnetic contribution , the so called magnetic @xmath1 effect , denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "it is usually the case that @xmath8 has a sign opposite to @xmath37 resulting thus in the saturation of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite have shown that @xmath8 is proportional to the small - scale current helicity of the system , hence it is possible to write @xmath1 as a sum of two contributions , one from the fluid turbulence and other from the magnetic field , as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mean density of the medium , assumed here as a constant , and @xmath42 is the current density of the fluctuating field .",
    "the mathematical expression that describes the evolution of @xmath8 may be obtained by taking into account the magnetic helicity evolution @xcite , which leads to : @xmath43 where @xmath44 with @xmath45 is a suitable choice for the wave number of the forcing scale , the magnetic reynolds number @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the flux of the magnetic @xmath1 effect related to the flux of the small - scale magnetic helicity , @xmath48 through : @xmath49 according to previous authors @xmath8 has a finite value in the interior of the domain in absence of fluxes ( @xmath50 ) , and its sign is usually opposite to the sign of @xmath37 in such a way that the final amplitude of the total @xmath1-effect decreases , and so does the final value of the magnetic energy .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that the catastrophic quenching could be alleviated by allowing the flux of small - scale magnetic ( or current ) helicity out of the domain , so that the total magnetic helicity inside need not be conserved any longer .",
    "alternately , we may introduce those fluxes in the equation for @xmath8 ; see equation ( [ eq.flux ] ) .",
    "several candidates have been proposed for the helicity fluxes in the past @xcite . amongst them",
    "are the flux of magnetic helicity across the iso - rotation contours , advective and diffusive fluxes and also the explicit removal of magnetic helicity in processes like coronal mass ejections or galactic fountain flows , for the case of the galactic dynamo .    from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the nature of the flux terms in the equation for @xmath8 has not been demonstrated with sufficient rigor .",
    "however , several dns have pointed to its existence .",
    "firstly , the shearing box convection simulations of @xcite showed that in the presence of open boundaries , the large - scale magnetic field grows on temporal scales much shorter than the dissipative time scale .",
    "they concluded from this that open boundaries may allow the magnetic helicity to escape out of the system .",
    "these experiments seem to be compatible with the flux proposed by @xcite , whose functional form may be expressed as ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for further details ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean rate of strain tensor and @xmath53 is a non - dimensional scaling factor . as we assume @xmath22 , this flux has the following three components : @xmath54   \\ ; , \\\\",

    "secondly , @xcite performed @xmath9 dynamo simulations driven by forced turbulence in a box with an equator .",
    "they found that the diffusive flux of @xmath8 across the equator can be fitted to a fickian diffusion law given by , @xmath57 they also computed the numerical value of this diffusion coefficient , and found it to be of the order of turbulent diffusion coefficient .",
    "they also found that the time averaged flux is gauge independent .",
    "both results were later corroborated by simulations without equator , but with a decline of kinetic helicity toward the boundaries @xcite .",
    "additionally , magnetic helicity may be advected by the mean velocity with a flux given by @xmath58 , or it may be expelled from the solar interior by coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) or by the solar wind .",
    "this flux , @xmath59 , may account for @xmath60% of the total helicity generated by the solar differential rotation , as estimated by @xcite .",
    "it can be modeled by artificially removing a small amount of @xmath8 every @xmath35 time @xcite , or also by a radial velocity field that mimics the solar wind .",
    "the total flux of magnetic helicity may be written as the sum of these contributions , @xmath61 since in this dynamo model we do not include any component of the velocity field other than the differential rotation , in this study we will consider only the first two terms on the rhs of equation ( [ eq.fluxes ] ) .",
    "we solve equation ( [ eq.inb ] ) , ( [ eq.ina ] ) and ( [ eq.am ] ) for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath8 in the meridional plane in the range @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we consider two different layers inside the spherical shell . in the inner one the dynamo production terms are zero and go smoothly to a finite value in the external layer .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity changes from a molecular to a turbulent value from the bottom to the top of the domain .",
    "this is achieved by considering error function profiles for the magnetic diffusivity , the differential rotation , and the kinetic @xmath1 effect , respectively ( see fig .",

    "the boundary conditions are chosen as follows : at the poles , @xmath73 , we impose @xmath74 ; at the base of the domain , we impose a perfect conductor boundary condition , i.e.  @xmath75 . unless noted otherwise , we use at the top a vacuum condition by coupling the magnetic field inside with an external potential field , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "a good description of the numerical implementation of this boundary condition may be found in @xcite .",
    "the equations for @xmath62 and @xmath63 are solved using a second - order lax - wendroff scheme for the first derivatives , and centered finite differences for the second - order derivatives .",
    "the temporal evolution is computed by using a modified version of the adi method of @xcite as explained in @xcite .",
    "this numerical scheme has been used previously in several works on the flux - transport dynamo and the results were found to be in good agreement with those using other numerical techniques @xcite .    in the absence of magnetic helicity fluxes ,",
    "equation ( [ eq.am ] ) for @xmath8 corresponds to an initial value problem that can be computed explicitly .",
    "however , as we are going to include a diffusive flux , we use for @xmath8 the same numerical technique used for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "they found that this critical value , @xmath141 , diminishes with increasing the amount of shear . since we have used a strong shear ( @xmath86 ) we use nominal values of @xmath142 , but without any algebraic quenching .",
    "the term @xmath143 develops a multi - lobed pattern which travels in the same direction as the dynamo wave , this confirms that the vc flux follows the lines of iso - rotation .",

    "a similar secondary dynamo is found to be working for a different distribution of shear and @xmath37 @xcite . as with pf boundary condition ,",
    "large values of @xmath53 result in a numerical instability of the magnetic field in the simulation with vf .",
    "the main result of this section is that the vc flux does not alleviate catastrophic quenching of the dynamo for large values of @xmath80 ( see the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.en.vc.flux ] a and c ) .",
    "the reason for this may be related to the fact that the radial flux has components that are either proportional to @xmath166 or to @xmath167 ( equation [ eq.vcfr ] ) .",
    "as @xmath167 vanishes on the top boundary , and @xmath166 is small , the vc flux is not able to dispose of @xmath8 across the boundary .",
    "this might change if diffusive fluxes became important near the top or if a different boundary condition on @xmath63 were applied .",
    "we have developed @xmath0 dynamo models in spherical geometry with relatively simple profiles of @xmath37 and shear ( @xmath168 and @xmath169 ) .",
    "we choose potential field ( also vertical field in some cases ) and perfect conductor boundary conditions for the top and bottom boundaries , respectively .",
    "we estimate the critical dynamo number by fixing @xmath86 and varying @xmath72 while using algebraic quenching .    using a dynamo number , @xmath170 , that is slightly super - critical , we solve the induction equations for @xmath63 and @xmath62 together with an equation for the dynamical evolution of the magnetic @xmath1 effect or @xmath8 .",
    "we find that for positive ( negative ) values of @xmath72 in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere , @xmath8 is mainly negative ( positive ) , with narrow fractions of opposite sign in regions where @xmath37 or @xmath171 are equal to zero .",
    "we find that the kinematic phase is independent of @xmath80 .",
    "however for @xmath172 there exists a phase of relaxation post saturation in which the averaged magnetic field oscillates about a certain mean .",
    "the larger the @xmath80 , the more pronounced are the damped oscillations and the longer is the relaxation time ( fig .",
    "[ fig.no.flux ] ) .",
    "the final value of the magnetic energy obeys a @xmath173 dependency ( @xmath174 for magnetic field , fig .",
    "[ fig.brms ] ) , which is in agreement with earlier work @xcite .",
    "we argue that including equation ( [ eq.am ] ) in mfd models is appropriate for describing the quenching of the magnetic field in the dynamo process .",
    "since we observe large - scale magnetic fields at high magnetic reynolds numbers in astrophysical objects , there must exist a mechanism to prevent the magnetic field from catastrophic quenching .",
    "we have studied the role that diffusive and vc fluxes may play in this sense .",
    "their contribution may be summarized as follows :    1 .   in the presence of diffusive fluxes",
    ", @xmath8 has only one sign in each hemisphere ( negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in southern ) and is evenly distributed across the dynamo region ( fig .",
    "[ snaps.flux ] ) .",
    "2 .   for @xmath99",
    "the mean values of @xmath8 are similar to models without diffusive fluxes , whereas for @xmath175 , @xmath176 has smaller values that seem to be independent of @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.brms ] , middle ) .",
    "3 .   even a very low diffusion coefficient , e.g.  @xmath177 , causes @xmath136 to depart from the @xmath174 tendency and converge to a constant value which is then around @xmath178% of the equipartition value for large values of @xmath80 , but below the value of @xmath179 used in this study ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig.brms ] , top ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath125 result in larger final field strengths .",
    "5 .   in models with",
    "only radial shear the vishniac - cho flux contributes to @xmath8 with a component that travels in the same direction as the dynamo wave .",
    "this produces a different radial and latitudinal distribution of the magnetic @xmath1 effect that also affects the distribution of the magnetic fields .",
    "however , it does not help in alleviating the quenching at high @xmath180 . on the contrary ,",
    "the larger the coefficient @xmath53 , the smaller is the resultant magnetic field .",
    "6 .   in models with",
    "only latitudinal shear the vc flux travels radially outward but it remains concentrated at the center of the dynamo region . in a given hemisphere the resultant distribution of @xmath8 has both positive and negative signs . the part of @xmath8 that has the same sign as @xmath37 enhances dynamo action .",
    "this effect is more evident in models with vertical field boundary conditions ( figs .",
    "[ snaps.vc.flux]b-d ) . 7 .   in models with vacuum and vertical field boundary conditions and @xmath154",
    ", the vc flux increases the final value of the magnetic field by a factor of two compared to the case without any fluxes .",
    "the magnetic field in models with @xmath181 and with non - zero vc flux decays after the kinematic phase since the total @xmath1 effect becomes subcritical ( see dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.en.vc.flux ] a and c ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath53 produce narrow bands of @xmath8 which drives intense dynamo action in these regions .",
    "this positive feedback between the magnetic field and @xmath8 causes the simulation to become numerically unstable in the absence of any other quenching effect .    from the above results it is clear that diffusive fluxes are much more important in alleviating catastrophic quenching when compared to the vishniac & cho fluxes ( in the form of equation [ eq.vcf ] ) for a large range of @xmath80",
    "this is somehow intriguing since it is known from dns that shear in domains with open boundaries does indeed help in alleviating the catastrophic quenching .",
    "it may be understood as a result of the large value of @xmath159 compared with @xmath72 and also to the top boundary condition for the azimuthal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the results presented above indicate that considerable work is still necessary in order to understand the role of larger - scale shear in transporting and shedding small - scale magnetic helicity from the domain .    in snapshots of the meridional plane as well as in butterfly diagrams we notice that the diffusive fluxes do not significantly modify the morphology and the distribution of the magnetic field when compared with cases without fluxes or even with simulations with algebraic @xmath1 quenching . on the other hand , for models with vc flux the distribution of @xmath8 becomes different and so does the magnetic field .",
    "this is clear from the butterfly diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ but.vc.flux]b , which exhibits a magnetic field confined to equatorial latitudes reminiscent of the observed butterfly diagram of the solar cycle .",
    "even though this result corresponds to a simplified model , it illustrates the importance of considering the dynamical @xmath1 quenching mechanism for modeling the solar dynamo .",
    "similar changes in the distribution of @xmath8 and @xmath182 are expected to happen when advection terms are included in the governing equations .    in the simulations presented here ,",
    "@xmath183 and @xmath1 effects are present in the same layers .",
    "an interesting question is whether the quenching of the dynamo is catastrophic when both layers are segregated , as in the parker s interface dynamo or the flux - transport dynamo models .",
    "we address this question in detail in two companion papers @xcite .",
    "we should notice that the back reaction of the magnetic field affects not only the @xmath1 effect , but also the other dynamo coefficients , including the turbulent diffusivity .",
