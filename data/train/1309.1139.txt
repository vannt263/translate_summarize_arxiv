    "the chiral @xmath1-wave ( @xmath2 @xmath3 )  phase in both superconductors @xcite and ultracold atomic systems @xcite has attracted significant attention in recent years , mainly because its vortex core supports a unique bound quasiparticle ( non - abelian ) excitation with zero energy known as a majorana fermion .",
    "a two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological system with well isolated vortices can be thought of as a quantum computing device where a unitary transformation ( braiding vortices @xcite ) , the basic operation of any quantum computer , is performed in a degenerate space @xcite topologically protected from other nontopological excited states by an energy gap @xcite . in chiral @xmath1-wave superfluid systems , this energy gap is proportional to the @xmath1-wave superfluid gap parameter .",
    "increasing the @xmath1-wave superfluid pairing , then , can increase the energy gap , which , in turn , makes the topologically protected computation less susceptible to finite temperature effects .",
    "however , for a wave with finite angular momentum , there is a centrifugal barrier in its scattering potential which prevents the wave from penetrating the interior and scattering effectively from the two - body potential .",
    "thus , for typical ground state atoms , the @xmath1-wave superfluid pairing is highly suppressed .",
    "the advent of cold - atom systems opened up the possibility of  using electromagnetic fields to tune and design two - body interactions capable of enhancing chiral @xmath1-wave superfluid pairings @xcite . the same goal may also be achieved in a bose - fermi mixture since bosons can induce and hence modify the fermi - fermi interaction in a fermi gas @xcite .  in a dipolar quantum gas @xcite ,",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction represents a control knob inaccessible to nondipolar bosons .",
    "thus , mixing dipolar bosons with fermions opens up new possibilities @xcite .",
    "experimentally , great progress has been made in recent years in achiving dipolar quantum gases consisting of either heteronuclear molecules with electric dipoles @xcite or atoms with magnetic dipoles @xcite .  in this article",
    ", we consider a quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) cold - atom mixture of nondipolar fermions of mass @xmath4 in a spin - polarized fermi gas and bosons of mass @xmath5 in a dipolar condensate where all the dipoles are oriented along the axial ( @xmath6 ) direction .",
    "the collective excitation of such a system was discovered @xcite to exhibit , at finite momentum , a minimum analogous to the  roton \" minimum in superfluid helium @xcite .",
    "dutta and lewenstein @xcite pointed out recently that the existence of dipolar bosons in such a model can significantly enhance the unconventional superfluids in the spin - polarized fermi gas .  the underlying physical mechanism @xcite is the ability to enhance the induced fermi - fermi attraction by lowering the energy cost of the phonons of the dipolar condensate near the roton minimum @xcite ( see the main text for detail ) .",
    "this raises the questions of how  the enhanced induced interaction , usually ignored in the stability analysis of the bose - fermi mixture , affects the stability property of the mixture , and how this same enhanced interaction affects the effective mass of the fermions near the fermi energy and hence the @xmath1-wave superfluid critical temperature .  in what follows ,",
    "we apply the hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - field theory to gain insight into these questions and identify the parameter space in which the mixture is stable against density fluctuations and the @xmath1-wave superfluid pairing can be resonantly enhanced .",
    "to begin with , we divide the interactions ( in momentum space ) into a short - range part , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 , characterized with s - wave scattering lengths @xmath10 , between a boson and a fermion , and @xmath11 , between two bosons , where @xmath12 , and a long range part , @xmath13 , due to the dipole - dipole interaction , where @xmath14 is the induced dipole moment , @xmath15 the second - order legendre polynomial , and @xmath16 the polar angle of wavevector @xmath17 .  thus , @xmath18 @xmath19 is the total bose - bose interaction .",
    "the particles in the mixture are confined , by sufficiently high harmonic trap potentials along the axial dimension , to a quasi-2d plane where the axial degree of freedom is frozen  to the zero - point oscillation and can thus be factored out .  integrating out the axial degree of freedom via the relations @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the axial oscillator lengths , we arrive at a qasi-2d dipolar bose - fermi mixture characterized by the effective 2d interactions @xmath24 @xmath25 , and @xmath26   , \\label{ubb(k)}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 measures the dipolar interaction relative to the s - wave contact interaction , and @xmath28 is a well - behaved function @xcite which increases monotonically from 0 to @xmath29 ,",
    "reaching @xmath30 of its full value when @xmath31 , and erfc@xmath32 is the complementary error function .  in arriving at these effective interactions",
    ", we have assumed that the axial oscillator lengths are sufficiently large compared with the relevant scattering lengths so that atoms experience essentially 3d collisions and there is no need to consider the confinement induced resonances @xcite .  using the bogoliubov perturbative ansatz and diagonalization procedure @xcite , we can describe the dipolar bose gas near zero temperature ( @xmath33 ) as a uniform dipolar condensate of number density @xmath34 plus a collection of phonon modes that obey the dispersion spectrum @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the phonon speed and @xmath37 measures the healing length , @xmath38 , in terms of @xmath39 .",
    "( from now on , @xmath17 stands for @xmath40 , the in - plane wavevector , for notational convenience . )    in a dipolar condensate , there is a competition between the side - to - side arrangement of two dipoles where the dipole - dipole interaction is the most repulsive and the head - to - tail configuration where the dipole - dipole interaction is the most attractive . in the 3d ( or large @xmath39 )",
    "limit , the head - to - tail configuration and hence the attractive interaction can be significant , and @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ ubb(k ) ] ) reduces to @xmath42 . in this limit ,",

    "( [ phonon spectrum ] ) acquires an imaginary frequency in the long wavelength limit , and the condensate is unstable against collapse .  in the 2d ( or small @xmath39 ) limit , the head - to - tail arrangement is suppressed , and @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ ubb(k ) ] ) asymptotes to the effective 2d contact interaction @xmath46 , which is @xmath47 times more repulsive than if the dipole interaction were absent . in the quasi-2d case , which is our focus here ,",
    "the head - to tail configuration is not completely suppressed .",
    "this is the origin of the attractive part in eq .",
    "( [ ubb(k ) ] ) , which depends on @xmath48 defined in eq .",
    "( [ g(x ) ] ) .  as a result , in quasi-2d space ,",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath29 does not automatically mean condensate collapse as in the 3d limit .  instead ,",

    "[ fig:1](a ) , and only when the roton minimum crosses zero , becoming imaginary , does the condensate become unstable ( against the formation of a density wave ) .",
    "integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom , we obtain a total effective hamiltonian , @xmath51 , for a quasi-2d mixture with an effective area @xmath52 and fixed particle number densities , @xmath34 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 accounts for the dipolar condensate energy , and @xmath55   \\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}}^{\\dag}\\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\nonumber\\\\ &   + \\frac{1}{2a}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{q}}u\\left ( q\\right )   \\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}}^{\\dag}\\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime } -\\mathbf{q}}^{\\dag}\\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime}}\\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\text { , } \\label{hfe}\\ ] ] describes an effective fermi gas in which fermions interact via the two - body interaction potential ( in the static limit @xcite ) , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 note that fermi statistics prohibits two fermions in a spin - polarized fermi gas to participate in s - wave scattering .  in our model , two fermions of the same spin can interact indirectly by exchanging virtual phonons with the help of the intermediate states containing one phonon without violating the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "equation ( [ phonon - induced interaction ] ) describes precisely this phonon - mediated fermi - fermi interaction .",
    "the fermi pairings can benefit from this induced interaction , which is now tunable by varying the roton minimum , provided that fermions and bosons can form stable mixtures near the roton minimum .",
    "thus , we first address the stability issue using the energy density , @xmath58 , where , for simplicity , the average is performed assuming that the fermions are in the normal gas phase ( at @xmath59 )  and thus distribute according to @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61here , @xmath62 is the step function and @xmath63 the ( 2d ) fermi momentum .",
    "a straightforward application of the hartree - fock mean - field theory @xcite finds , @xmath64 where the first line , which will be denoted as @xmath65 , represents the energy of the mixture when the induced interaction is ignored , and the terms in the second line represent , respectively , the direct ( hartree ) and the exchange ( fock ) energy of the induced interaction hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hfe ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that the latter , which is defined as @xmath66 , can be reduced to  the 1d integral@xmath67 where @xmath68 is a function of @xmath69 defined as @xmath70 when @xmath71 and @xmath72 otherwise .  the quantity @xmath73 , in both eqs .",
    "( [ energy densities ] ) and ( [ exchange energy density ] ) , is a unitless coupling parameter defined as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the ( 2d ) density of states independent of the fermi energy @xmath76 .",
    "the same @xmath73 also appears in the gap equation  ( [ gap l ] ) we will use to estimate the critical temperature .",
    "the uniform mixture is unstable against small changes in densities if any of the following inequalities , ( a ) @xmath77 , ( b ) @xmath78 , and ( c ) @xmath79 , occur .",
    "the analysis below , however , focuses only on the instability towards phase separation ( c ) as it always precedes collapse of the condensate ( a ) and that of the fermi gas ( b ) for the parameters of interest .",
    "it is well - known , from stability analysis of the bose - fermi mixtures in which the phonon - induced interaction is insignificant and is thus neglected , that the dimensionality plays an important role .",
    "this is because the kinetic energy of the fermi sea depends on the fermi surface gemometry , which is strongly influenced by the dimensionality .",
    "the kinetic energy ( of the fermi sea ) is @xmath80 in 3d and @xmath81 in 1d .",
    "thus , contrary to 3d mixtures , which are stable only when @xmath82 is below a threshold @xcite , 1d mixtures are stable provided that @xmath83 is above a threshold @xcite .",
    "2d mixtures are distinct in the sense that the 2d kinetic energy follows the square law , @xmath84 .",
    "a simple analysis of @xmath85 indicates that the mixture is either stable or unstable , and the transition from the stable to unstable mixture takes place when @xmath73 exceeds the threshold value @xmath47 irrespective of the particle number densities .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    this transition is not a clear cut anymore when the hartree - fock energies are included because @xmath53 and @xmath34 enter @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ phonon - induced interaction ] ) ( via the fermi wavenumber @xmath87 and the relative healing length @xmath50 ) in a complicated manner . thus , the functional dependencies of @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ exchange energy density ] ) on @xmath34 and @xmath53 can be highly asymmetrical and nontrivial .",
    "figures [ fig:1](b)-(e ) showcase four sets of stability diagrams in density space with different @xmath73 when the hartree - fock energies are included .",
    "as can be  seen , the region of instability depends on densities and grows in size as @xmath73 increases .  the density space is mainly occupied by the stable states ( yellow ) for small @xmath73 , and by unstable states ( green ) for sufficiently large @xmath73 .  [ the light blue area ( in which @xmath50 is lower than @xmath89 ) is the region where the roton minimum becomes imaginary . ]  but , the instability , particularly in the region where the roton minimum is low , develops when @xmath73 is far less than @xmath47 ( which equals @xmath90 for @xmath91 ) as indicated by the green areas in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "in the parameter space that hosts the single uniform mixture , the interaction induced by bosons , being attractive , provides identical fermions with the opportunity to form odd - parity superfluids .  to investigate this possibility ,",
    "we begin with the 2d equation for the gap parameter , @xmath92 which is coupled to the fock potential , @xmath93 via the quasiparticle energy spectrum , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .  in the space spanned by the eigenfunctions of the @xmath6-component of angular momentum , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the polar angle of vector @xmath17 .  in this space , by virtue of the circular symmetry of the interaction , the gap parameters of different @xmath100-waves , @xmath101 , are all decoupled , satisfying@xmath102 where @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the energy cutoff ( set to twice the fermi energy @xmath76 @xcite in our estimate below ) .  as such",
    ", one can define independently a critical temperature@xmath106   , \\label{tc}\\ ] ] for each @xmath100-wave superfluid , where @xmath107 or @xmath108 in arriving at eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) , we have assumed that only states near the fermi energy contribute to the gap equation ; we have used the @xmath59 normal fermi gas , where the fermi surface is well - defined , to estimate both the fermi momentum , @xmath63 , and the effective mass , @xmath109 , on the fermi surface , due to the fock exchange potential @xmath110 , where@xmath111 thus , our predictions remain quantitatively accurate only in the weak coupling regime , but , nevertheless , are expected to shed light on some qualitative aspects of superfluid pairings under more general circumstances .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we consider an example in which @xmath112 which translates into @xmath113 @xmath114 .",
    "a numerical investigation finds that the @xmath1-wave pairings dominate other odd superfluid pairings ( not shown ) when the product , @xmath115 , exceeds @xmath116 .  as the roton minimum",
    "is lowered [ fig . [ fig:2](a ) ] , the @xmath1-wave interaction , @xmath117 ( @xmath440 ) , increases [ fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) ] , while , at the same time , the effective fermi mass also experiences a significant increase [ fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ] .",
    "for a particle in a lattice , its effective mass can be changed by changing the energy band structure . in our work here , fermions are submerged in a background of dipolar condensate .",
    "the ( effective ) mass of a fermion is different from its bare value since a fermion is now dressed with phonons of the dipolar bec . this polaronic effect , which is typically small and negligible , is seen to increase appreciably when the roton minimum energy is lowered [ fig . [ fig:2](b ) ] .",
    "it is interesting to point out that while increasing the @xmath1-wave interaction surely enhances the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) , increasing the effective fermi mass also serves to enhance the exponential factor as it amounts to amplifying the coupling constant , @xmath118 by a factor @xmath119 according to eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) .",
    "these translate into a dramatic increase in the corresponding critical temperature for the @xmath1-wave  superfluid phase as clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) .    [ ptb ]    fig2.eps    in our system ,",
    "the induced interaction is independent of the sign of @xmath120 @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the superfluid with @xmath122 is degenerate with the superfluid with @xmath123 .",
    "a question arises : what is the nature of the @xmath1-wave superfluid in our model at @xmath59 ?  in principle , the gap parameter becomes the superposition of these two superfluids , @xmath124   $ ] , where @xmath125 .",
    "the ground state energy due to the superfluid pairing is then minimized when @xmath126 is maximum @xcite .",
    "a variational analysis of @xmath126 obtained from the gap equation ( [ gap ] ) at @xmath59 @xcite indicates that only when @xmath127 or @xmath29 does the gap parameter reach its maximum value of @xmath128 so that @xmath129 ( up to a global gauge transformation ) .",
    "thus , our system realizes at zero temperature the ground state phase of chiral @xmath0 waves whose gap parameters can be resonantly enhanced by tuning the roton minimum .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied , within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach , the @xmath1-wave superfluid pairings in a quasi-2d dipolar bose - fermi mixture .  in a quasi-2d trap setting",
