    "this paper is intended to provide a complete quantum mechanical description of the instability inherent in zero - temperature atom - molecule bose systems with attractive interparticle interactions , but with positive scattering length . at low - density",
    "it is well - known that the pressure in these systems is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the s - wave scattering length and @xmath2 is the number density .",
    "this suggests that despite being innately attractive , the ensemble can remain stable against collapse if there is a nonnegative scattering length @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we find a ground state that tends toward collapse , with the expected , positive - pressure case realized only at the cost of including an inherent quantum instability @xcite .",
    "elucidation of this result is provided by a series of derivations presented in the following sections .",
    "+ because many - body interactions are built up from the pairwise sum of those between individual particles , section [ twobodyscattering ] begins with a review of the low - energy two - body scattering . after relating the scattering length to the interaction strength",
    ", it is shown that a separable interaction not only captures the low - energy physics , but yields analytically tractable results .",
    "in addition , we include coupling to a molecular feshbach state , thus enabling a tuning of the effective scattering length through a resonance .",
    "solving the two - body problem provides a convenient context to model the many - body atom - molecule system , which is the subject of section [ hamiltonianofcoupledsystem ] .",
    "as discussed in section [ gaussianvariationalprinciple ] , a gaussian variational procedure is used to find the lowest energy states of the system . upon deriving general variational expressions for these states , the static ,",
    "uniform case is considered in section [ staticuniformsolution ] where it is found that a collapsing two - piece ground state persists even in the case of a positive scattering length .",
    "+ notwithstanding , the expected solution can be obtained by allowing the chemical potential to assume complex values , where the imaginary part quantifies the decay of the condensate .",
    "section [ complexmu ] demonstrates this result for the special case of a uniform system whereas section [ decayinnonuniformcase ] proves the persistence of this feature even when the uniformity constraint is removed . in the final section ,",
    "we expand in small oscillations , obtaining a pair of discrete excitation frequencies corresponding to the collapsing solution .",
    "additionally , the expected energy per particle resides within a continuum of excitations above the collapsing ground state .",
    "energy conservation indicates that the decay represents a transition into the continuum , thus revealing that the expected solution evolves into states that tend toward collapse as well .",
    "this analysis completes the result as it reveals the imaginary part of the chemical potential to be associated with a decay rate into collective modes of the collapsing lower state .",
    "because microscopic models of many - particle assemblies are built from all pairwise interactions between the constituents , a reasonable place to begin is by considering the interaction just between two particles . after identifying the s - wave scattering length as the relevant low - energy scattering parameter , this quantity",
    "is then related to the interaction strength . in doing so",
    ", we recognize relationships that any model potential must satisfy in order to accurately describe the interparticle interaction . from this analysis , we find that the separable potential is simple enough to be of calculational advantage , yet nonetheless retains sufficient flexibility to depict low - energy scattering .",
    "+ with the separable interaction , the scattering description is extended to include the possibility of molecular binding , a crucial element in the loss mechanisms at work in atomic condensates @xcite .",
    "due to the presence of the hyperfine - induced molecular state , there exists a feshbach resonance that occurs when the effective scattering length becomes unbounded upon tuning an externally applied magnetic field . in completing the analysis ,",
    "an effective range equation is derived for this coupled system . from these two - body results",
    ", a many - body hamiltonian may be postulated in which subsequent investigation reveals the properties of the collective .      in the center of mass ,",
    "two - body scattering processes are equivalent to reduced masses , @xmath3 , impinging on a force center that is identical to the interparticle interaction . within the influence of this potential , @xmath4",
    ", the reduced mass obeys the full time independent schrdinger equation , @xmath5 where the hamiltonian is a sum of a free kinetic term plus the potential , @xmath6 .",
    "long before collision , the incoming particles lie far outside the potential s range , thus allowing the incident flux to be represented as plane waves obeying the free schrdinger equation , @xmath7 it is convenient to relate the plane waves to the full scattering state , @xmath8 , by introducing the @xmath9 operator , @xmath10 from this definition , the solution to the full schrdinger equation ( [ tbse ] ) may be written @xmath11 where the free - particle green s function , where @xmath12 is the actual particle mass , not the reduced mass .",
    "hence , the energy eigenvalue is denoted as @xmath13.]has the coordinate space representation @xmath14 in this expression , the integral is evaluated with complex contour integration in the standard way . ]",
    "+ obtaining the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath15 requires the usual expansion @xmath16 , where the leading term is kept in the denominator , but the first two terms are retained in the exponential in ( [ tbgreen ] ) .",
    "substitution of this expanded green s function into ( [ tbsesol ] ) leads to the asymptotic scattering wave function , @xmath17 { } e^{i \\mathbf{k } \\cdot \\mathbf{x } } - \\frac{1}{8 \\pi }      \\langle k \\mathbf{\\hat{x } } | { \\mathcal t } ( 2 k^2 ) | \\mathbf{k } \\rangle \\frac{e^{i k x}}{x } .\\ ] ] comparing this with the usual form @xmath18 , it is seen that , up to an overall constant , the matrix element is simply the scattering amplitude : @xmath19 where the polar angles are those between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "+ since we will ultimately be concerned with zero - temperature bosonic systems , it is useful to examine the low - energy form of the scattering amplitude .",
    "figure [ radial_wavefn ] shows the radial wave function , which at `` zero energy '' has a linear form where the s - wave scattering length is the axial intercept : @xmath22 comparing @xmath23 with the asymptotic form of the wave function , the scattering length is identified as the zero energy @xmath9 matrix element , @xmath24    [ h ]      a two - body model interaction is sought that is not only consistent with the low - energy scattering physics summarized by fig.[radial_wavefn ] , but that leads to analytically tractable results as well .",
    "in particular , it is required that there exist the possibility for either positive or negative scattering lengths in the case of attractive interactions . to address these considerations",

    ", the scattering length carries a subscript to distinguish the background value from the case where a feshbach state is included .",
    "+ equation ( [ tba_lambda ] ) is consistent with the intuitive results depicted in fig.[radial_wavefn ] , thus demonstrating that the separable form captures the low - energy scattering physics . according to ( [ tba_lambda ] )",
    ", an attractive interaction @xmath34 can yield either positive or negative scattering lengths , which is qualitatively consistent with fig.[radial_wavefn ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "alternatively , a repulsive interaction @xmath35 only gives rise to non - negative scattering lengths , which is as required .",
    "henceforth , we confine our attention to attractive interactions in which the range is allowed to vanish for simplicity . in this limit , we take @xmath36 , with @xmath25 approaching zero from below in such a way that @xmath37 remains finite .",
    "+      up to this point , all that has been considered pertains to the case of a single channel outcome in which two particles enter in a particular state or channel , scatter , then reemerge in the same channel .",
    "since there also exists the possibility for bound states to arise , an analysis is undertaken in which the energetically favored channel of the scattering state is coupled to the energetically unfavorable molecular state .",
    "this coupled channels analysis forms the basis of the description of the feshbach resonance , a phenomenon in which the effective scattering length becomes unbounded . + as shown in fig.[channel_potentials ] , the difference in electronic spin configuration gives rise to a distinct potential for each of the scattered and bound states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the schematic illustrates the molecular binding energy , @xmath38 , as the energy difference between the bound state and two free atoms , relative to the molecular ( closed channel ) potential .",
    "analogously , the detuning , @xmath39 , is defined as the same , but relative to the scattering ( open channel ) potential .",
    "since both potentials arise due to a difference in spin states , the detuning , and hence the binding energy , can be adjusted using the zeeman interaction in the presence of an applied magnetic field , @xmath40 .",

    "specifically , the condition @xmath428 also precludes @xmath361 from existing , thus giving the continuous part of the spectrum , @xmath429 since the form of @xmath430 is the same regardless of whether @xmath212 or @xmath230 , eq .

    "note that the real part of the energy per particle lies inside the continuum of the collapsing state . due to energy conservation",
    ", this upper solution can only evolve into a state at the same level , suggesting the coherent decay be interpreted as a transition into collective phonon excitations which inherit the same collapsing behavior as their associated ground state .",
    "hence , the condensate is initially lost through decay into the phonons of the lower level , as opposed to a physical loss of particles .",

    "we have considered the case of an atom - molecule condensate in which the interactions were attractive yet the effective scattering length was positive .",
    "this situation raised the question of whether the condensate collapsed due to the mutual attractions or remained stable in accordance with the positive scattering length . starting with a two - body analysis , a separable potential was used to realistically model the interparticle interaction . due to its success",
    ", this separable form was implemented in the many - body hamiltonian .",
    "equations of state were then obtained from the application of a variational principle that utilized a gaussian trial wave functional for the many - body state . despite the positive scattering length ,",
    "a collapsing solution was obtained , consisting of a relatively low - density piece having only a molecular component to its condensate . at higher density",
    ", there occurred a quantum phase transition after which the solution comprised both atomic and molecular condensate components . only by allowing the chemical potential to assume complex values could the experimentally observed case be obtained .",
    "as the phase of the order parameter , the chemical potential has an imaginary part quantifying a decay rate , assigned a physical meaning through a small oscillation analysis about the equilibrium solutions .",
    "expanding around the stationary points revealed two discrete eigenfrequencies associated with the low - density molecular condensate solution .",
    "moreover , the experimentally observed energy per particle lay within an excitation continuum of the collapsing two - piece lower state . from energy conservation ,",
