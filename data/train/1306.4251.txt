    "<S> this low dimensionality of fluctuations might also survive in finite field and drive the critical behavior at @xmath34 . a hint in this direction is provided by the strong temperature dependence of the magnetization @xmath93  @xcite and the thermal expansion @xmath30  @xcite that both behave as @xmath94 close to the critical field @xcite . from a quantum critical scaling point of view </S>",
    "<S> such a strong divergence as a function of @xmath18 implies a low spatial dimensionality @xmath16  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a neutron scattering study in the bicritical regime would be useful not only to determine the dimensionality but also the dynamics of the critical fluctuations . </S>",
