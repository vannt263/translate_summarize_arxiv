    "+ we have to note here that both n - body simulations and analytical methods have problems in describing very accurately some physical properties of dark matter haloes .",
    "this is due to either technical difficulties or to the fact that some physical mechanisms are not taken into account .",
    "for example , in a recent paper @xcite use the results of the millenium - ii simulation , @xcite , to derive a formula of the same form of that given in eq.(13 ) .",
    "millenium - ii simulation has better resolution than millenium , @xcite , simulation . due to the better resolution , the best fitting values of the parameters in eq.(13 )",
    "are changed .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath243 , that is the exponent of the mass of the halo , from @xmath244 becomes now @xmath245 .",
    "obviously the dependence of mass remains weak but such a change in the value of @xmath243 results , for a halo with @xmath246 , to a new merger rate that is @xmath247 larger .",
    "this percentage is too large since it can change the whole picture , at least for large haloes , resulting from our comparison .",
    "additionally , it is interesting to notice fig .",
    "a1 in the appendix of the above paper .",
    "it describes merger rates given by five different algorithms .",
    "these algorithms are used to analyze the results of the same simulation and to study fragmentation effects in fof ( friends of friends ) merger trees . from this fig .",
    "it is clear that differences due the use of different algorithms may be larger than the differences between analytical methods and n - body simulations derived by our study and shown in our fig.9 . + from the above discussion it is clear that the results of n - body simulations are very sensitive not only to the resolution but also to the halo finding algorithm .",
    "this sensitivity can lead to completely different results .",
    "the following example is very characteristic : @xcite studied , among other things , the value of the spin parameter as a function of the mass of dark matter haloes .",
    "they found that the fof algorithm results to a spin parameter that is an increasing function of mass while a more advanced halo finding algorithm , that they been proposed , results to a spin parameter that is a decreasing function of mass ! on the other hand , n - body simulations have the ability to deal with complex physical process .",
    "for example the destruction of dark matter haloes as well as the the role of the environment are factors that are not taken into account in most of the analytical methods .",
    "this is an additional reason for the presence of differences between the results .",
    "+ summarizing our results we could say that : sc approximates better the merger rates of small haloes while ec the merger rates of heavy haloes .",
    "this is obviously an interesting information , but since it has been resulted from a specific solution for the problem of the distribution of progenitors , a further study of different solutions is required .",
    "the finding of a solution that approximates satisfactory merger rates from n - body simulations , independently on the redshift and mass should be an important achievement .",
