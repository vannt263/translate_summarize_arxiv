    "flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) along with bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) constitute the most extreme subclass of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( rlagns ) called blazars , with observed luminosity outshining their host galaxies .",
    "the dominant radiation sources in these objects are believed to originate from relativistic jets that are very strongly doppler boosted by being viewed at angles @xmath0 10@xmath1 with the observer s line of sight ( los ) ( e.g.  urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "this gives rise to flux variability in all electromagnetic ( em ) bands , from radio to very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - rays , strong optical ( @xmath23% ) and radio polarization as well as superluminal motion and anisotropic radiation .",
    "the variability of blazars may either arise from accretion disc ( ad ) instabilities or changes intrinsic to the relativistic jet , although interstellar scintillation can also cause observed radio variations ( e.g.  heeschen et al .",
    "these fluctuations have been observed at all accessible timescales ranging from a few minutes through days and months to even decades .",
    "blazar variability is often broadly divided into three temporal classes .",
    "changes of few hundred to few tenths of magnitude observed in the flux of a source from minutes to less than a day are categorized as intra - day variability ( idv ) or or micro - variability or intra - night variability ( e.g.  kinman 1975 ; wagner & witzel 1995 , clements , jenks , & torres 2003 ; rector & perlman 2003 ; xie et al .",
    "2004 ; gupta et al .",
    "2008a ) , while variations taking place from several days to few months are usually known as short time variability ( stv ) and those taking from several months to many years are usually called long term variability ( ltv ; gupta et al .",
    "2004 ) ; in the latter two classes blazar variability often can exceed even 5 magnitudes .",
    "= 6.0 in = 9.0 in    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath3 @xmath4 slope and @xmath5 intercept of ci against v ; + @xmath6 pearson coefficient ; @xmath7 null hypothesis probability +    colour  magnitude ( cm ) plots on few months timescales for the three sources are shown in figure 7 .",
    "we have fitted straight lines ( ci = @xmath8v + @xmath9 ) to colour index , ci against v magnitude plots for each source .",
    "the fitted values for the slope , @xmath8 , and intercept @xmath9 , are listed in tables 7 , 8 and 9 for pks 1510 - 089 , pg 1553 + 113 and mrk 501 , respectively , along with the linear pearson correlation coefficients , @xmath10 and the corresponding null hypothesis probabilities , @xmath11 .",
    "a positive slope here means positive correlation between the ci and the brightness of the source .",
    "here we consider the result significant only if the null hypothesis probability is @xmath12 and pearson correlation coefficient , @xmath13 . a significant positive correlation in these plots",
    "would physically imply that the source follows a bluer - when - brighter ( bwb ; or redder when fainter ) trend , i.e. , the source tends to be bluer when its brightness increases , while a negative slope would indicate an opposite correlation between the source magnitude and ci , indicating that the source exhibits redder - when - brighter behaviour ( rwb ) behaviour .",
    "the correlation analysis results between brightness of the source and the colour indices are also given in tables 79 .",
    "for these sources we did not find any strong correlation ( pearson correlation coefficient , @xmath14 ) between v band magnitude and colour indices on several months timescale .",
    "the cm relationship at diverse timescales can help us understand the emission mechanisms responsible for blazar variability and also help pin down the emitting regions .",
    "different cm relationship in bl lacs and fsrqs could be due to the existence of two varying modes , i.e. , larger flux variations with lesser spectral changes or vice versa .",
    "raiteri et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found at most weak correlations between the source magnitude and the colour indices for the bl lacerate object s5 0716 + 714 , that are similar to our results .",
    "agarwal et al .",
    "( 2016 ) also found no evidence for the source to display spectral changes with magnitude on either of the timescales even when the bl lac s5 0716 + 714 was rapidly variable .",
    "the cm relation in blazars has been found to vary among their outburst state , active state , and the faint state ( sasada et al .",
    "optical emission from blazars is generally a combination of jet and ad radiation and usually dominated by that from the relativistic jets .",
    "however , fsrqs are usually low frequency synchrotron peaked sources , thus having a substantial contribution to the blue - uv continuum arising from thermal contamination from the ad which is expected to produce a slowly and weakly variable bluer emission component .",
    "the position of the thermal blue bump and its strength in comparison to the jet emission also affect the spectral behaviour of fsrqs .",
    "when relativistically beamed jet synchrotron emission dominates the ad emission , the bwb trend can be explained by acceleration of relativistic particles or due to injection of fresh electrons having even harder energy distribution .",
    "sun et al .",
    "( 2014 ) recently proposed a timescale dependent colour variation model , according to which a bwb trend in blazars is strongest for timescales of @xmath15 30 days and it eventually weakens with as timescale increases to above 100 days .",
    "our results seem to complement this model . densely sampled and",
    "simultaneous multiband photometric observations will be helpful in understanding the cm relationship in greater detail and in better contraining models .",
    "blazar variability studies can help us examine the radiation mechanisms in more detail while also provide an insight on the location , size , structure , and dynamics of the emitting regions ( ciprini et al .",
    "most mechanisms for variability in rlagns are expected to arise within the relativistic jet whose emission is doppler boosted . the only significant extrinsic variability in blazars is probably seen in the radio band , where strongly frequency dependent interstellar scintillation is found to be dominant mechanism of variability at low radio frequencies .",
    "intrinsic processes operate across all em bands , and include directly those causing changes in the jet radio emission .",
    "some of these clearly arise from synchrotron and compton losses which cause electron energy losses but energy gains can come from the fresh injection of particles with energy distribution higher than that of the previous ones . both of these processes can co - exist but operate on different timescales .",
    "the initial origin of variability could be located in ad based fluctuations propagating into the jets , or it could start with changes in the outgoing flow , usually related to shocks in the blazar jets . according to the dominant shock - in - jet model , synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic )",
    "processes are the most common basic processes ( hughes , aller , & aller 2011 ) .",
    "when those intense emitting regions are found in the highly relativistic doppler boosted jets pointed at very small angles with respect to the los , variations are significantly amplified and frequency shifted owing to relativistic beaming .",
    "changes in the jet geometry due to changing jet direction can cause variations in the bulk doppler factor of the relativistic blobs traveling along the jet ( usually in range 10 - 30 ) , which in turn can lead to blazar variability at realtively long time - scales ( hovatta et al .  2009 ; rani et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the key processes responsible for blazar variability probably are due to a jet not being a stationary object which gives rise to various instabilities , turbulence ( e.g.  marscher 2014 ; calafut & wiita 2015 ) and developing or decaying shocks .",
    "these act on a range of timescales . if @xmath16 is the the doppler factor , since @xmath17 , an increase in @xmath16 causes an increase in flux ( villata & raiteri 1999 ) and also in the observed frequency ( @xmath18 ) . during their low states ,",
    "blazar variablity can be attributed to ad instabilities since thermal emission from the central region of blazars can dominate over jet emission then . then the variability can be explained by orbits of hot spots on the ad , including eclipsing of the hot spot by parts of the disk between the individual spot and the observer ; this aspect directly depends on the geometry of the ad and also on the viewing angle of the observer . even though optical band is a narrow part of the complete em spectrum , it is critical in determinibg the presence of additional components other than synchrotron continuum , such as ad emission or host galaxy contribution .",
    "the presence of both bwb and rwb trends in some blazars can be explained by superposition of both blue and red emission components where the redder one is attributed to the synchrotron radiation from the relativistic jet while the blue component could come from the thermal emission from the ad .",
    "the bwb trend may indicate that two components , one variable ( with a flatter slope , @xmath19 ) ( @xmath20 ) and another stable ( with @xmath21 ) , contribute to the overall emission in the optical regime .",
    "it also could be possibly explained with a one component synchrotron model if the more intense the energy release , the higher the particles frequency ( fiorucci , ciprini , & tosti et al .",
    "then the bwb trend could be explained if the luminosity increase was due to injection of fresh electrons with an energy distribution harder than that of the previously cooled ones ( kirk et al .",
    "1998 ; mastichiadis & kirk 2002 ) .",
    "the bwb trend could also be due to doppler factor variations in a spectrum slightly deviating from a power law ( villata et al .",
    "if optical emission is combination of emission from both jet and ad , then as the jet brightens from a low state , the colour of the combined emission gets redder as synchrotron emission from the relativistic jets is intrinsically redder than that of the ad , producing rwb behaviour .",
    "however , if even higher energy electrons are injected causing further brightening , then we get a bluer colour ( bwb ) ; this is usually dominant during an outburst state .",
    "we found a weak bwb trend , i.e. , a spectrum becoming flatter when the object is brighter , in two of the sources while the opposite was found dominant in one of them .    in this paper",
    ", we have performed multiband optical photometry for three tev blazars namely : pks 1510@xmath22089 , pg 1553@xmath23113 and mrk 501 between 2012 and 2014 in a total of 95 nights in b , v , r , and i passbands .",
    "this allowed us to study flux and colour variability characteristics on diverse timescales . during our 7 nights of observation for idv for pg 1553@xmath23113",
    "we detected clear microvariability on a single night using f - statistics and @xmath24-test ( at 3@xmath25 significance for both ) .",
    "but if we include pv cases ( at @xmath26 for either tests ) then we can say we found the source to be variable on intraday timescales on 6 out of these 7 nights .",
    "carini ( 1990 ) monitored about 20 blazars and found idv in most of them .",
    "he also noticed that probability of detecting idv increased to 80% when observed for more than 8 hours .",
    "later , a sample of 34 bl lacerate objects were observed by heidt & wagner ( 1996 ) when they found that about 75% of the sample displayed significant variations when observed for @xmath15 6 hours .",
    "carini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that less than 10% of his blazar sample displayed variability on intraday timescales when observed for only @xmath27 4 - 5 hours .",
    "thus , the chances of observing idv in blazars is greatly improved when observed for more than 6 hours .",
    "the results in this study are consistent with these earlier observations .",
    "clearly , idv results can be further improved by more dense and lengthier observations .",
    "we searched for flux and colour variability on few months to few years timescales and found significant flux variations on these timescales with moderate colour variations for all three tev blazars .",
    "we also studied the correlation between the v magnitude of the source and corresponding variations in the ( b - i ) , ( b - v ) , ( r - i ) , and ( v - r ) colour indices .",
    "our observations did not reveal the presence of significant correlated spectral variability in these targets on short timescales .",
    "variability studies of larger blazar samples on minutes to years timescales are extremely important since they can provide information on numerous blazar parameters .",
