    "<S> we present an analytical method for determining the designability of protein structures . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our method to the case of two - dimensional lattice structures , and give a systematic solution for the spectrum of any structure . using this spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> the designability of a structure can be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> we outline a heirarchy of structures , from most to least designable , and show that this heirarchy depends on the potential that is used . </S>",
    "<S> +    _ e^-i _ str \\{r_i } _    the protein design problem asks which and how many amino - acid sequences fold into a given protein structure . this problem , </S>",
    "<S> having obvious practical and evolutionary significance , attracted considerable attention and effort of experimentalists @xcite and theorists @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , tang and coworkers carried out a thorough study of the design problem for a simple square and cubic lattice model of proteins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors enumerated all sequences made of two types of monomers and all conformations for 2-dimensional 36-mers and 3-dimensional 27-mers . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation provided a density of states in sequence space for the studied models , i.e. how many sequences have a given energy in a given conformation . for each conformation , </S>",
    "<S> the `` designability , '' which is defined as the number of sequences that have this conformation as a ground state , was determined in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it was found that designability varied from conformation to conformation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the structures that possess certain degrees of symmetry turned out to be most designable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result tempts one to speculate that the factor of designability may be the cause of symmetries observed in real proteins . </S>",
    "<S> + the physical reason for the observed relationship between geometric properties of conformations and their designability remained unclear . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is important to evaluate how robust is this relationship with respect to choice of lattice model , model protein `` alphabet , '' and interaction parameters between model aminoacids . </S>",
    "<S> recent numeric studies @xcite and @xcite showed that the set of the most designable structures does indeed depend on the potential and aminoacid alphabet used . + a deeper understanding of the designability problem requires an analytical solution that may shed light on the general geometric features that make structures designable . such a solution will facilitate an informed connection between model results and real proteins . </S>",
    "<S> + in this letter we present a statistical mechanical analysis of designability , and give an analytical solution to the problem on a two - dimensional lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the analogy between protein design and a class of statistical - mechanical spin models established in earlier works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we use the standard lattice model to represent protein conformations . on a lattice </S>",
    "<S> , a structure is defined as a self - avoiding walk of length @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of a sequence of residues @xmath1 in a structure with coordinates of the monomers @xmath2 is @xmath3 @xmath4 is defined to be 1 when @xmath5 and @xmath6 are nearest - neighbors on the lattice and not sequence neighbors along the chain . for real proteins the definition of a contact requires a choice of a cut - off distance . </S>",
    "<S> the folding potential is given by a symmetric matrix @xmath7 whose entries are the pairwise interaction energy between aminoacid residues of types @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> + in any instance of the design problem , the structure @xmath10 is given ( we will refer to this structure as the `` target conformation '' for design ) , and we are asked to find all sequences whose native ( folded ) state is @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the number @xmath11 of such sequences is the _ designability _ of the structure . since the residues of a protein </S>",
    "<S> are tightly packed in space , only maximally compact lattice structures are generally studied . on a square lattice </S>",
    "<S> these correspond to self - avoiding walks that completely fill a square . </S>",
    "<S> the folding potential @xmath12 is therefore assumed to have a non - specific attractive term ( which we have omitted ) , that favors compact conformations . </S>",
    "<S> + in order for a sequence to fold and to be stable in the desired target conformation it must have lowest energy in this conformation compared to its energy in all alternative conformations . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of energies of alternative conformations is qualitatively similar to that of a random heteropolymer , i.e. it consists of a continuum part , with a high density of states whose lowest energy is @xmath13 , and of a few discrete energy levels lying below @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the value of @xmath13 is self - averaging @xcite , i.e it depends on amionacid composition rather than on a particular sequence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while this description is strictly applicable to three - dimesional heteropolymers ( see though @xcite , it was shown in @xcite that it qualitatively applies to two - dimenisonal case . + </S>",
    "<S> thus the issue of designability is reduced to the question of how many sequences with a given aminoacid composition can fold into a given conformation with an energy @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> each structure has a sequence - space energy spectrum given by the energy density @xmath15 the above expression corresponds to a system of @xmath0 spins @xmath1 confined to an interaction geometry dictated by @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of possible residue types . in this language </S>",
    "<S> the aminoacid composition of a sequence is equivalent to total magnetization and is denoted by the letter @xmath19 , which is in general a @xmath18-dimensional vector . </S>",
    "<S> the probability @xmath20 that a sequence @xmath21 of composition @xmath19 , will fold into a structure @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , is @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the temperature of the thermodynamic `` freezing '' transition in random heteropolymers having composition @xmath19 , and @xmath26 is the effective number of conformations per monomer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these properties of @xmath13 render it a valuable link between sequence and structure space . </S>",
    "<S> if we know the spectrum @xmath27 of a structure @xmath22 over all sequences of fixed composition c , we can compute its expected designability as follows : @xmath28 on a two - dimensional square lattice , maximally compact structures have a property that makes the spectrum calculation @xmath27 analytically tractable . if the ends of the chain are prescribed to be neutral </S>",
    "<S> - they do not interact with any monomers - then the entire structure can be decomposed into a direct product of one - dimensional loops and strands . </S>",
    "<S> a loop is a collection of @xmath29 monomers in which monomer @xmath30 is in contact with monomer @xmath31 , for @xmath32 , and monomer 1 is in contact with monomer @xmath29 ; if monomer 1 and monomer @xmath29 are not in contact , we call the collection a strand . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the decomposition of a particular 36-mer into strands and loops ( ends have been allowed to interact in this figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> this decomposition derives from the restriction that nearest neighbors along the chain are not in contact , leaving each monomer in the interior of a structure exactly 2 contacts to make . </S>",
    "<S> since this excludes branched systems of contacts , the only possibilities left are loops and strands . </S>",
    "<S> monomers lying on the square border of a structure can make only one contact because the chain must occupy two of the three neighboring sites . </S>",
    "<S> strands , therefore , must begin and end on the border of a structure , and loops must lie entirely within it . </S>",
    "<S> since the corners of a structure can not interact , a square structure of length @xmath0 has @xmath33 interacting border sites . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there must be @xmath34 strands in each structure . including the ends of the chain would add at most 2 branched systems , or would change the number of strands by at most 2 . </S>",
    "<S> while the number of strands is largely the same for all structures , the distribution of lengths of strands is structure - dependent , and will prove to be the determinant of designability . + we restrict this discussion to systems with two types of aminoacids , which we denote + 1 and -1 , although the general methodology can certainly be applied to larger alphabets . following the analogy between protein design and spin models @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , aminoacid types will be called `` spins '' in what follows . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction energies are taken to be @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . the general aim is to compute @xmath27 , which can be deduced from the partition function at composition c , over all sequences @xmath38 : @xmath39 note that composition in the 2-spin case is a scalar corresponding to the net magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the delta function can be expressed as a fourier integral , and if we define the parition function for the @xmath40-th loop or strand to be @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the set of all spins in the @xmath40-th loop or strand , we can write @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the number of strands and loops , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 can be computed by the transfer matrix method ; we define the transfer matrix @xmath47 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the eigenvalues of @xmath47 , we have for a loop , @xmath54 , while for a strand @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the length of the @xmath40-th loop or strand . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for strands is more complicated than that for loops because the first and last monomers in a strand have to be summed over separately . by diagonalizing @xmath47 , the following expression for strands </S>",
    "<S> can be derived : @xmath57 / ( \\lp - \\lm ) \\label{zstrand}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the eigenvalues can be calculated , and one observes that if @xmath58 , we get @xmath59 , while @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this situation corresponds to any potential for which @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we will call this the symmetric potential , because any such potential is the same as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 . under the symmetric potential , @xmath65 for loops , and @xmath46 for strands simplifies considerably to @xmath66 if @xmath0 is the chain length of a structure , the total partition function ( [ z(c ) ] ) for the symmetric potential now becomes @xmath67 using the binomial expansion , the integral can be calculated exactly and the density of states , @xmath68 obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the following is a plot of @xmath69 using @xmath70 , @xmath71 , n = 36 , and c = 0 :    under the symmetric potential , a structure s spectrum depends only on its length , composition , and the number of strands . </S>",
    "<S> since these three are the same for each structure , the spectra of all structures are identical ( up to end - effects ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that all structures have the same expected designability , with fluctuations only due to the effects of interacting ends and to any sequence - dependent terms of @xmath13 . for large @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> these terms will be insignificant . </S>",
    "<S> + the symmetric potential is a singular case in that structural features play no role in designability . </S>",
    "<S> it has previously been identified in @xcite as an important special case for design . </S>",
    "<S> we now show how designability becomes sensitive to structure under perturbations of this potential . </S>",
    "<S> + under the symmetric potential , one eigenvalue is zero . if we add a small perturbation @xmath72 to the potential , so that @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , we would expect one eigenvalue still to be small compared to the other . under a perturbed potential , then , @xmath76 . starting from the general expression for strands ( [ zstrand ] ) , we observe that if @xmath77 , we have two geometrical series in @xmath78 , and we can rewrite it as : @xmath79\\ ] ] where @xmath80 . the corresponding expression for loops </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath81 using these expressions in equation ( [ z(c ) ] ) for @xmath82 results in a product of the loop and strand @xmath83 s . </S>",
    "<S> we can expand this product in @xmath84 , and obtain the following kinds of terms : the principal contribution - @xmath85 - ( zero - order in r ) is a structure - independent term corresponding to the symmetric potential . </S>",
    "<S> terms coming from a single loop of length @xmath56 look like @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> terms coming from a single strand of length @xmath56 are : @xmath87 \\label{strandpert}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> strands of length 2 contribute no terms . </S>",
    "<S> thus , strands have terms at all powers of @xmath84 less than @xmath89 , while loops only perturb at @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> since the smallest possible loop is of length 4 , strands of lengths greater than 2 are much more important to the structure of the spectrum than loops of any length . </S>",
    "<S> + to calculate a perturbed spectrum , one still has to back - transform the fourier variable @xmath91 in each term . setting @xmath92 </S>",
    "<S> , the perturbed eigenvalues must satisfy @xmath93 and @xmath94 . the principal contribution to the partition function </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath95 which can be computed by binomial expansions of @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> the only difficulty in doing so comes from odd powers of a square - root term in the expression for @xmath52 which would normally lead to a power series expansion rather than a finite binomial expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation we make in our computation is to replace the odd powers of the square root with the next even number , so that we have terminating binomial expansions at all powers . to compute a perturbation of the form </S>",
    "<S> @xmath97 we use @xmath98 and obtain : @xmath99 which is similar to @xmath100 except for another binomial that can be expanded . </S>",
    "<S> computing perturbations of any order is therefore relatively straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> + we performed computations to check our theory with a full enumeration of sequences and structures that was published by tang and coauthors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors used a potential ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) which can be rescaled to the perturbed potential @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath64 , @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> the following is a log plot of the principal ( structure - independent ) contribution to the spectrum of a 36-mer :    this lowest - order approximation of the density of states bears a striking resemblance to the spectrum calculated by full enumeration for 3d structures ( c.tang private communication ) . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately our request to provide sample densities of states for 2d structures had not been granted by the authors of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> qualitative features such as the shape and the anomalous speckeled pattern emerge from our theory . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern of the spectrum is essentially a splitting of the states of the symmetric potential due to the perturbation @xmath72 . + the expected designability ( [ expectdesign ] ) depends on the value of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the following is a plot of the change in expected designability due to the first - order strand perturbation as a function of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the logarithm of negative numbers was taken in absolute value and plotted as a negative value . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the expected designability of the structure due to this perturbation is negative for a large range of @xmath13 in the lower part of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> since strands of lengths greater than 2 will contribute a first - order perturbation , the more such strands in a structure , the less designable it will be . </S>",
    "<S> the most designable structures will , therefore , contain the maximum number of strands of length 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the major effect determining designability ; adding higher - order terms does not change this result . </S>",
    "<S> the effect which 2-strands have on designability is due to the condition @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> one can also perturb with @xmath106 and obtain the opposite result : 2-strands are not desirable . </S>",
    "<S> all the plots shown here correspond to composition @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> similar plots are obtained over a large range of @xmath19 , with significant qualitative differences for @xmath108 close to @xmath0 , i.e. as the sequence approaches a homopolymer . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion remains unchanged by these differences because at extreme compositions we expect very few sequences to design any given structure . </S>",
    "<S> + deciding whether or not a strand of length @xmath109 is better for designability than a strand of length @xmath110 requires looking at the change in expected designability due to higher order perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that up to strands of lengths 5 , the shorter the strand , the more designable the structure . </S>",
    "<S> for longer lengths , differences in designability become very small , and resolution of these differences requires precise knowledge of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> + we have presented a general , analytical approach to the protein design problem , and by applying it to the case of two - dimensional structures , we have shown how it effectively recognizes features that make some structures much more designable than others . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed us to identify a heirarchy of designability based on strand lengths . </S>",
    "<S> future work should generalize these results to larger alphabets ( which leads to a @xmath18-th degree polynomial in @xmath111 ) , and to lattices of dimension three ( which leads to highly branched systems of contacts ) . </S>",
