    "the magellanic clouds ( mc ) offer an exemplary insight into galaxy interactions , which are known to be an important driver of galaxy evolution .",
    "this is due to their proximity to the milky way ( mw ) that allows for detailed mapping of their gaseous and stellar components , the 3d kinematics of their stellar component , and the chemical - abundance makeup of these components .",
    "the strongest clues to their interaction are the h i features known as the magellanic stream ( ms ) , the bridge , and the leading arm ( la ) ( e.g. , nidever et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "earlier work attributed the formation of these structures as being due to the tidal interaction between the clouds and the mw , with the understanding that the smc s tidal disruption produced the ms and la ( e.g. , gardiner & noguchi 1996 , connors et al .",
    "another scenario for the origin of the ms is ram - pressure stripping of the lmc gas due to the motion of the cloud through the gas in the galactic halo ( mastropietro et al .",
    "2005 ) ; this model however can not explain the la .",
    "this earlier work was based on proper - motion measurements of small absolute value and the mw halo being modeled primarily as an isothermal sphere , which led to bound orbits of the clouds around the mw .",
    "more recent work offers a somewhat different picture .",
    "the hst proper - motion measurements of the clouds by kallivayalil et al .",
    "( 2006a , b , hereafter k06 , see also piatek et al .",
    "2008 ) indicate that the clouds are on their first passage ( besla et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ) about the mw .",
    "the ms and la are made of material pulled out from the smc as in older models , however , the interaction is due solely to the lmc , far from the gravitational influence of the galaxy ( besla et al .",
    "a more recent proper - motion study of the clouds encompassing a 450 deg@xmath1 area was presented by vieira et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter v10 ) based on southern proper motion material ( e.g. , girard et al .",
    "v10 were able to determine the most precise _ relative _ motion between the clouds due to the global solution performed on the contiguous area encompassing the clouds ; this will help better constrain the recent interaction between the clouds . while the size of the proper motions for both clouds are slightly smaller than those from k06",
    "( i.e. , less energetic orbits ) the results agree within formal uncertainties .",
    "see also the costa et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ground - based ccd measurements , which advocate smaller absolute value proper motions and the discussion about the accuracy of such measurements in diaz & bekki ( 2012 , hereafter db12 ) .",
    "thus , the new picture that the clouds are on a more energetic orbit than earlier work had implied , appears real . however , there is still room for debate regarding the first - passage scenario proposed by besla et al .",
    "( 2007 ) or a two mw - pericentric passage scenario proposed by db12 who explored a large orbital parameter space centered on the v10 proper motions and realistic mw halo potentials .",
    "the consensus is that the ms , la and bridge are of tidal origin , and formed from material pulled out from the smc in its interaction with the lmc and perhaps the mw",
    ". the galaxy s gravitational influence can help explain the bifurcation ( putman et al .",
    "2003 ) of the ms , as proposed by db12 , and also suggested by the earlier work of connors et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in the besla et al .",
    "( 2010 ) model , no such bifurcation is seen . moreover , the besla et al .",
    "( 2010 ) model implies that the clouds will have a close encounter in the near future rather than in the near past , as indicated by many other observations .",
    "the main criticism for tidal models is the absence of older stars in the ms and bridge . only young , blue stars were known to exist in the bridge from the early work of irwin et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , with the inference being that they were born in situ .",
    "attempts to find older stars in the bridge and ms as tidally stripped material have failed . however , there are recent indications that older stars in the bridge do exist ( monelli et al .",
    "2011 ) , and perhaps previous searches of these stars were not wide enough and not necessarily in the right place ( db12 ) .",
    "another piece of evidence that tidal models are indeed on a sure footing is the study of olsen et al .",
    "( 2011 , hereafter o11 ) who isolated a population of red giants , supergiants and carbon stars in the lmc with peculiar kinematics .",
    "their radial - velocity analysis indicated that these stars are either counter - rotating in a plane nearly coplanar with the lmc s disk , or have prograde rotation in a disk inclined by @xmath3 with respect to the lmc s disk .",
    "they also determined the abundances of 30 such stars as well as bona fide lmc stars .",
    "they found that the kinematically distinct stars have lower metallicities than do lmc stars ; specifically , [ fe / h]=@xmath4 dex , while lmc stars have [ fe / h]=@xmath5 dex .",
    "the kinematical and chemical properties of these stars lead o11 to suggest that they were captured from the smc .    in this study",
    ", we focus on two observational aspects that will help better model and understand the lmc / smc / mw interaction .",
    "the first is to provide a reliable map of young , ob - type candidate stars over a @xmath0 deg@xmath6 area that includes the clouds periphery , the bridge , the la and part of the ms .",
    "we select these candidates using photometry from the galaxy evolution explorer survey ( galex ) , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , the southern proper motion program 4 ( spm4 ) , and the american association of variable star observers all sky photometric survey ( apass ) and proper motions from spm4 .",
    "the second aspect , is a proper - motion analysis of the kinematically distinct o11 giants , in the lmc . in this study",
    "we have focused on ob - type candidates and giants in order to be able to reliably eliminate foreground contamination , and to have distant stars with apparent magnitudes in the range where spm4 proper - motion errors are well under control .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we present the catalogs used , followed by the selection of ob candidates in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we present the spatial distribution of the candidates in an area focused on the clouds , then on a larger - scale area encompassing the ms and la . in section 5",
    ", we analyze the proper motions of the o11 sample and show that the proper - motions also indicate a kinematically distinct group reinforcing the conclusions of o11 and further characterizing the kinematical nature of this population . in section 6",
    "we discuss our findings in the context of the dynamical interaction of the clouds and we summarize our results in section 7 .",
    "the fourth installment of the yale / san juan southern proper motion catalog , spm4 contains positions , absolute proper motions and @xmath7 , @xmath8 photometry for over 103 million objects south of @xmath9 .",
    "the catalog construction is described in girard et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ; it is roughly complete to @xmath10 , and the proper - motion precision is 2 - 3 mas  yr@xmath11 for well - measured stars . at the bright end ,",
    "proper motions are on the international celestial reference system via @xmath12 stars , while the faint end is tied to the inertial system via galaxies .",
    "about two thirds of the catalog include @xmath8 ccd photometry obtained with a 4k @xmath13 4k pixelvision ( pv ) camera ( @xmath14/pix ) mounted in the focal plane of the yellow lens of the 50-cm double astrograph at el leoncito , argentina .",
    "initially , an apogee 1 k @xmath13 1 k camera ( @xmath15/pix ) was placed behind the blue lens of the astrograph ; this was later replaced by a 2 k @xmath13 2 k apogee alta camera ( @xmath16/pix ) .",
    "the pv data were used for astrometry and @xmath8 photometry .",
    "the data from the apogee cameras were used to obtain @xmath7 photometry only .",
    "since the @xmath7 ccd area coverage is only about @xmath17 of the pv area coverage , we did not use @xmath7 photometry in the current study .",
    "the ccd data were calibrated using @xmath18 @xmath19 values corrected to the johnson system . while spm4 also includes photographic photometry , we chose not to use it here , as it is less reliable than the ccd data .",
    "hereafter , when mentioning spm4 @xmath8 data , we refer solely to the calibrated pv ccd data . internal error estimates ( girard et al .",
    "2011 ) indicate a @xmath8 precision between 0.02 and 0.04 mags .    to further assess errors in the spm4 @xmath8 photometry from an external comparison ,",
    "we make use of the ogle3 @xmath8 photometry in the lmc ( udalski et al .",
    "since the spm survey uses a diffraction grating in front of the objective , and the area under consideration is dense , crowding will affect the spm4 photometry .",
    "therefore this comparison will not necessarily reflect the average photometric errors in spm4 , but rather an upper limit .",
    "a total of 111735 objects were matched between the two catalogs , within a @xmath20 matching radius , and with @xmath21 . in figure 1",
    "we show the area coverage of ogle3 and that of the intersection of ogle3 and spm4 @xmath8 .",
    "isodensity contours of m giants selected from 2mass ( see section 2.4 ) are also shown .",
    "the coordinates are a gnomonic projection of galactic longitude and latitude centered at @xmath22 . throughout this paper",
    ", the spatial distribution will be represented with these coordinates , unless otherwise noted . in figure 2",
    "we show @xmath8-magnitude differences as a function of @xmath23 , for every tenth data point .",
    "the red line shows a moving median of the differences .",
    "a vertical line at @xmath24 indicates the limiting magnitude of our ob - star candidates .",
    "this shallow limit compared to spm4 s @xmath25 limit is due to the fact that in its construction , spm4 used several input catalogs including 2mass for the faint end ( girard et al .",
    "thus , the shallow @xmath8 limit in spm4 reflects the 2mass limit for these blue objects , rather than the photographic limiting magnitude of the spm plates . from fig .",
    "2 , the scatter in the @xmath8-magnitude differences is @xmath26 mag for @xmath27 and @xmath28 mag for @xmath29 .",
    "since the dominant error in the differences is from spm4 @xmath8 , we will adopt these values as upper limits of the photometric errors in spm4 . the difference between spm4 and ogle3 as given by the moving median in @xmath30",
    "is @xmath31 mag .    .",
    "]    finally , we will also consider here a subcatalog built only in the area of the clouds and described in v10 .",
    "this catalog uses the same material as spm4 , but slightly different processing , with more careful treatment of magnitude - dependent systematics .",
    "the v10 catalog has @xmath32 million objects encompassing a 450-deg@xmath6 contiguous area including the clouds and the bridge ( excluding the central regions of the clouds due to crowding ) .",
    "it was built for the purpose of measuring the individual absolute proper motions of the clouds and a very precise relative proper motion between the clouds .",
    "we will also use the v10 proper motions in the selection of ob candidates to compare with the selection provided by spm4 proper motions .      to increase the area coverage of our study , we supplement the spm4 @xmath8 data with @xmath8 photometry from the aavso all - sky photometric survey - apass , described in henden et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . here",
    "we use the third data release , which includes johnson @xmath33 , sloan @xmath34 and positions for 18.9 million objects .",
    "magnitudes are reliable between @xmath35 to 17.0 ; the pixel scale is 2.57@xmath36 and the field of view is @xmath37 .",
    "the catalog starts to be incomplete at @xmath38 ; it is not yet fully contiguous , missing some @xmath39 in area .",
    "objects were matched by position , using a @xmath20 matching radius .",
    "we compare @xmath8 magnitudes from spm4 with those in apass , in overlapping regions .",
    "for well - measured stars , magnitude differences have a scatter of @xmath40 mag ; assuming errors are similar in both catalogs , this indicates @xmath8 errors of 0.05 - 0.06 mag .",
    "however , there are regions with significant offsets of the order of 0.5 to 1.0 mag ; these regions have the size of the apass field of view , therefore we believe they are some unreliably calibrated fields in apass .",
    "we have carefully examined magnitude differences as a function of declination and ra , and we find that large offsets are not present in the overall clouds and bridge areas ; the largest offsets are present at @xmath41 .",
    "we therefore proceed to use apass @xmath8 data for spm4 objects that do not have ccd @xmath8 data . of the entire list of objects to be examined @xmath17",
    "have @xmath8 from apass ; and of the list of ob candidates , @xmath42 are from apass .      here",
    ", we use the galex fifth data release ( gr5 ) catalog described by bianchi et al .",
    "we focus on the all - sky imaging survey ( ais ) that provides a list of 63.5 million unique sources with photometry in the far uv band ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) and the near uv band @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "only sources with a distance @xmath47 from the field center and with errors @xmath48 mag were included in this catalog .",
    "we match the galex sources with spm4 objects by position using a matching radius of @xmath49 .",
    "duplicate matches within this radius are eliminated by keeping the match with the smallest separation . in our analysis , we use only the @xmath50 band , since the @xmath51 band has far fewer detections .",
    "the spm4 catalog had been cross - matched with 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) prior to release ( girard et al . 2011 ) ; therefore @xmath52 magnitudes are present in the spm4 . in our analysis , we chose to use the @xmath53 band as it is the deepest ir band .",
    "since our ob candidates have extremely blue colors and relatively faint @xmath8 magnitudes ( see section 3 ) , the @xmath53 magnitudes are at the faint end of 2mass , and thus prone to larger errors than the average of 2mass . to verify that our ob candidate selection is not seriously affected by errors at the faint end of 2mass , we also make use of the deeper survey 6x 2mass in a few selected areas .",
    "specifically , we use the 383 deg@xmath6 and 127 deg@xmath6 areas in the lmc and smc respectively .",
    "thus , in addition to the 2mass - based selection we present a 6x 2mass - based selection for comparison .    for illustration purposes we construct isodensity contours of the m giants in the lmc and smc ; these represent an intermediately old population , of [ fe / h ] @xmath54 .",
    "m giants are selected from 2mass within a 400-deg@xmath6 box centered on the lmc , and a 225-deg@xmath6 box centered on the smc .",
    "m giants are selected based on 2mass colors according to the prescription described in majewski et al .",
    "we compile a list of about 4 million objects that have @xmath55 photometry and proper motions . for each object in this list we determine the reddening e@xmath56 from the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) maps and keep for further analysis objects with @xmath57 .",

    "specifically , a@xmath58 = 8.90e@xmath56 . for the @xmath8 band , we used a@xmath59 = 3.1 .",
    "the clouds are known to be affected by differential reddening due to the spatial variations of their intrinsic extinction as show by e.g. , zaritsky et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , haschke et al .",
    "our study in unlikely to be affected by this , as we sample regions in the outskirts of the clouds where the extinction as well as its spatial variation is small according to haschke et al .",

    "the black curve shows model main - sequence colors , while the green curves are white - dwarf models taken from vennes et al .",
    "the white - dwarf models correspond to two limiting masses of 0.4 m@xmath62 and 1.2 m@xmath62 .",
    "we have also matched our list with catalogs of known - type objects , to check their color distribution .",

    "this selection implies that the latest stellar type is b8 according to the models of vennes et al .",
    "the expected contamination in this color range is due to foreground stars such as ob subdwarfs and white dwarfs .",
    "our selection provides 3099 objects of which only two are classified as non - stellar objects : one is a 2mass extended source , the other a leda galaxy .    in figure 4 we show the spatial distribution in galactic coordinates of this sample ( top ) , and the @xmath67 distribution as a function of galactic @xmath68 ( middle ) and @xmath69 ( bottom ) . between @xmath70 to @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "to @xmath73 one can see as a density enhancement the periphery of the lmc and smc s wing .",

    "next , we divide our color - selected sample into four @xmath60 subsamples and explore their spatial and proper - motion distributions . from figure 5 , the most prominent clouds sample is in the color range @xmath78 , while the reddest subsample appears devoid of clouds stars . from the proper - motion distributions shown in figure 6 ,",
    "it is also clear that the color range @xmath78 has a tight proper - motion clump centered around @xmath79 mas  yr@xmath11 and is indicative of a kinematically cold and distant population .",
    "we therefore choose a stringently - defined sample by restricting the color range @xmath80 , i.e. , selecting the bluest two susbsamples shown in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "this will limit our sample to spectral types earlier than b5 ( @xmath81 k ) . by limiting to the bluest colors",
    ", we aim to target only the youngest distant stars , as well as to avoid some of the foreground contamination due to ob subdwarfs , which are known to be less frequent at bluer colors ( e.g. , vennes et al . 2010 ) . to eliminate nearby stars ( i.e. white dwarfs ) we also trim in proper - motion space as follows .",
    "we determine the average proper motion of stars located in the smc wing , then we keep only stars within a proper - motion radius @xmath82 mas  yr@xmath11 from this mean and with proper motion errors @xmath83 and @xmath84 mas  yr@xmath11 .",
    "figure 7 shows the proper - motion cut for the color and magnitude - selected sample ( left ) , and the proper - motion distribution in each coordinate ( right ) .",
    "there are 567 stars in this final sample , which was constructed to be as free as possible from foreground contamination .",
    "some ob - type stars that are genuine members of the clouds s system will be missed due to the circular footprint of galex , as well as due to the lack of photometry ( mostly uv , but some @xmath8 as well , see next section ) .",

    "white gaps are due to the lack of galex data : note the round footprint of the galex catalog . 2mass data and spm4 proper motions are practically everywhere in this area , and thus not highlighted .",
    "the location of the clouds is represented with m - giant isodensity contours from 2mass ( see also section 2.4 ) .",
    "our ob - type candidates are shown with blue circles .",
    "we have also applied the same selection criteria , but replacing the @xmath53-magnitude from 2mass , with that from 6x 2mass , for @xmath86 mag .",

    "the spatial distribution is essentially unchanged from that of the 2mass - only sample . the 6x 2mass sample",

    "finally , we perform one more test . we replace the spm4 proper motions with the proper motions from the catalog of v10 based on the same material as spm4 , but with slightly different processing .",
    "we regard this latter catalog as more accurate and precise than the spm4 , since more careful treatment was possible in this restricted area .",

    "the spatial distribution of ob candidates shows a very well - populated smc wing , with two branches partly surrounding the smc ; the opposite side from the smc wing , i.e. , the north - west periphery of the smc appears devoid of these stars . from the smc wing a rather narrow ( @xmath87 ) band extends toward the lmc , ending some @xmath88 from the lmc periphery , or at ra @xmath89 .",
    "a group of 2 - 3 candidates is present in the periphery of the lmc and in the direction of the band coming from the smc wing at @xmath90 , ( ra , dec ) = @xmath91 ; perhaps this indicates the spot where material from the smc is funneled into the lmc after the close encounter between the clouds . while there appears to be a gap of @xmath88 from the easternmost end of the smc wing to the group of 2 - 3 stars in the lmc s periphery , it is also possible that we miss candidates due to the galex gaps ( see fig . 8) .",

    "the distributions of each of these catalogs together with our ob candidates are shown in figs 12 , 13 and 14 .",
    "most of the matches are in the smc wing / bridge , and in the clump of stars to the left of the lmc bar , where clusters also show an enhancement resembling a spiral arm .",
    "the two clumps found at the ends of the lmc bar appear farther out than the extent of the emission nebulae and associations .",
    "in fact , none of the matches with all three catalogs are in these two clumps at the ends of the bar . in the smc region ,",
    "our candidates that form the two branches that partly surround the smc do not seem to be the edges of a roundish distribution of associations / clusters within the smc .",

    "for this reason , we develop a local , differential solution as follows .",
    "the lmc sample is chosen as a reference sample , while the captured - smc as a target sample .",
    "for each target star , we define a local sample formed from @xmath137 neighboring , reference stars , and calculate the proper - motion difference between target and the average of the reference stars .",

    "we also perform three types of local solutions which differ by the definition of the `` distance '' between reference and target stars .",
    "the first solution uses a metric that is a combination of spatial distance and @xmath8 magnitude difference . the spatial distance between target and reference",
    "is given by the gnomonic projection of celestial coordinates at the location of the target star .",
    "the metric distance is defined as @xmath141 . here ,",
    "@xmath142 and @xmath143 are the spatial coordinates in degrees , @xmath144 is the v - magnitude difference between target and reference star , and the factor 10.0 is used to scale magnitude units and spatial units . for each target star ,",
    "reference stars are sorted in increasing order of the defined distance , and we keep either 50 or 200 reference stars , to represent two different `` sizes '' of the local reference system .",
    "the second local solution uses a strict spatial distance , and keeps the closest 50 or 200 reference objects that also have a @xmath145 mag .",
    "the third local solution uses a strict spatial distance ; however reference stars are also required to have @xmath145 mag and @xmath146 mag .",
    "the color restriction aims to minimize color - dependent systematics .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram of captured - smc / targets stars and lmc / reference stars shown by o11 , their fig .",
    "6 , indicates that the lmc sample contains some bluer stars that are not present in the captured - smc sample ; thus a color - related analysis is a useful check .    with this procedure ,",
    "we obtain on average ( all solutions and parameters ) @xmath147 mas  yr@xmath11 and @xmath148 mas  yr@xmath11 .",
    "unsatisfied with the rather large uncertainties , we decided to include more information to this determination .",
    "we use the formal proper - motion errors from the spm4 catalog for target stars , and thus determine an error - weighted average .",
    "this procedure however is prone to any residual proper - motion systematics and , thus , needs to be checked . to do so",
    ", we use the lmc sample as a test sample .",
    "we randomly choose 285 stars ( mimicking the captured - smc stars ) and treat it as a control sample . since the lmc sample contains 4138 stars , one can devise 14 independent such control samples .",
    "the final result for a default control sample is the average of these 14 independent control samples .",
    "we apply the same procedures described above , and in principle one should obtain proper - motion differences equal to zero .",
    "this is readily obtained when we use simple averages for target control stars ; however , when we use an error - weighted average , we obtain a non - zero value in @xmath149 .",
    "we believe this is due to unaccounted for systematics in the spm4 .",
    "finally , we use the proper - motion differences as obtained by the overall control sample as a zero point offset to be applied to the results obtained with the captured - smc sample .",
    "all these results are summarized in table 2 , where we list the type of solution , the proper - motion difference for the captured - smc sample and the difference for the control sample which is subtracted from the previous number as a zero - point correction .",
    "uncertainties are shown in parentheses .",
    "the outcome of the zero - point correction and its formal uncertainty are also given . in figure 17 , we plot all these zero - point corrected determinations and their formal uncertainties ; they represent the proper - motion difference between the captured - smc sample and the bona fide lmc sample , at the location of each captured - smc star . as our final value",
    "we take a simple average of all these 24 determinations , and as uncertainty the average uncertainty as given by the weighted - average solutions .",
    "this number is @xmath150 mas  yr@xmath11 and @xmath151 mas  yr@xmath11 ; it is represented with a red symbol in fig .",
    "thus , we obtain a proper - motion difference consistent with zero along declination and @xmath152 different from zero along right ascension , which , incidentally , is oriented in the direction of the smc .",
    "having evidence that the two samples are kinematically distinct , we proceed to analyze the kinematics in a physically meaningful picture . from radial velocities alone and assuming circular motions , o11 proposed two kinematical solutions for the captured - smc stars : one is a nearly coplanar counter - rotating disk , the other a prograde disk inclined @xmath153 from the lmc disk . here , we test which of these is preferred given the proper - motion information .",
    "we remind the reader that what we have measured are proper - motion differences between captured - smc stars and lmc disk stars , locally , i.e. , at different regions in the disk which itself rotates .",
    "in addition to the rotation of the lmc disk , the bulk space motion of the lmc will be projected onto the proper motions in variable amounts across the disk of the lmc .",
    "this is also known as the perspective viewing effect on the proper motions .",
    "other effects include the precession and nutation of the lmc disk ; however the amount of precession for instance is rather uncertain , with some studies considering it significant ( e.g. , vdm02 ) , while others negligible ( e.g. , k06 ) .",
    "the equations for the velocity field across the lmc are given in vdm02 , and we use these in a simplified version , i.e. , in a coordinate system parallel and perpendicular to the line of nodes . here , we will neglect the effect of precession / nutation .",
    "also , the space motion of the lmc contributes to the proper motion perpendicular to the line of nodes as a constant ( i.e. , does not depend on the distance from the center of mass ) .",
    "however , the space motion of the lmc has an effect on the proper motion along the line of nodes that slowly varies with the distance from the center of mass . from fig .",
    "16 , it is apparent that the distribution of captured - smc stars has two concentrations , one in the north - west and the other in the south - east , roughly aligned with the line of nodes .",
    "for all these reasons , we define a new coordinate system , centered on the lmc s center , and rotated from the equatorial system by @xmath154 , i.e. , with @xmath142 coordinate along the line of nodes , and positive toward south - east , and @xmath143 coordinate perpendicular to it , and positive toward north - east .",
    "we rotate the proper - motion differences to this system , having now a component parallel to the line of nodes @xmath155 , and another perpendicular to it @xmath156 . in this system , we subtract the contribution of the lmc center of mass proper motion , such that the proper motion at each location reflects only the disk rotation and the perspective viewing ; note that perspective viewing does not affect the run of @xmath156 with @xmath142 .",
    "the lmc disk rotates clockwise , with the near side in the north - east . along the line of nodes , at negative @xmath142 , the rotation is projected onto @xmath156 with negative values ; the converse is true for positive @xmath142 .",
    "we restrict the captured - smc sample to stars within @xmath157 ( i.e. , near the line of nodes ) , and @xmath158 ( i.e. , eliminate the few sparse objects in the periphery of the lmc , and a few objects near the center ) .",
    "we also discard stars with proper - motion differences @xmath159 mas  yr@xmath11 . in principle , our method is applicable , if all stars are distributed along the line of nodes ; however we have a box aligned with the line of nodes , of thickness @xmath160 and length @xmath92 .",
    "given that the orientation of the line of nodes ranges by about @xmath161 from various studies ( e.g. , it is @xmath162 in o11 , and @xmath163 in vdm02 ) , our box of given thickness along the line of nodes can be thought of as absorbing this range .",
    "the objects are distributed roughly equally at positive and negative @xmath143 coordinate .",
    "therefore , we believe that our approximation works well in the context of our proper - motion errors .",
    "these cuts restrict our sample to between @xmath164 and 210 captured - smc stars for the various solutions shown in table 2 .",
    "to calculate the proper motions in this new system , we need a model for the rotation of the lmc disk , as well as the tangential and line - of - sight velocity of the lmc s center of mass , and the angle between the line of nodes and the direction of the tangential velocity . for the rotation , we adopt the model described in o11 , in which the disk has an inclination angle of @xmath165 ( van der marel & cioni 2001 ) , a rotation curve that increases linearly from 0 to 87 km  s@xmath11 between 0 and 2.4 kpc from the lmc s center and is flat afterward .",
    "the position angle of the line of nodes is @xmath166 ( measured from north to east ) .",
    "we assume that the lmc s center is at @xmath167 and the distance to the lmc is 50.1 kpc ( vdm02 ) .",
    "the tangential velocity of the center of mass and its orientation is that from v10 , and its line of sight velocity is @xmath168 km  s@xmath11 ( vdm02 ) .    in figure 18 , we show the proper - motions with respect to the lmc s center of mass @xmath156 ( top ) and @xmath155 ( bottom ) of the captured - smc stars as a function of @xmath142 coordinate .",
    "these are from the local solution @xmath169 with 50 reference stars ( see tab .",
    "2 ) , i.e. , one treatment of the six .",
    "the shaded areas represent the 1-sigma error of linear fits to the data .",
    "we also show the rotation curve of the lmc disk ( red line ) , the rotation curve of a counter - rotating disk ( dashed red line ) ( i.e. , in the same plane as the lmc disk , and with the same amplitude rotation , but in the opposite sense ) , and that of a prograde disk with zero inclination angle , and amplitude of 200 km  s@xmath11 ( blue line ) . in the top plot , these models are easily distinguishable , however , in the bottom plot they depart slightly from zero , and nearly coincide , indicating that rotation has a very small contribution to @xmath155 .    in figure 19 we show a zoomed - in version of fig .",
    "18 , where the data points are replaced with the error - weighted average values of the proper motions at positive and negative @xmath142 .",
    "each weighted average value is from one of the six different local - type solutions ( tab .",
    "the @xmath170 range of the @xmath142 coordinate at positive and negative @xmath142 is shown with grey lines .",
    "the representation of the three model disks is the same as in fig .",
    "the two solutions proposed by o11 for the captured - smc stars are as follows .",
    "the first is a disk of similar inclination to that of the lmc , specifically @xmath171 , but rotating in the opposite sense , with the line of nodes oriented at @xmath172 .",
    "they refer to this solution as the counter - rotating disk .",
    "although our model for the counter - rotating disk differs slightly from the o11 one , namely by @xmath173 in inclination , and @xmath174 in the orientation of the line of nodes , these slight changes do not affect our conclusions .",
    "for instance , the rotation velocity is projected onto @xmath156 as @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the inclination angle .",
    "a change of @xmath177 to @xmath161 implies a change of @xmath178 in @xmath175 , or of the order of @xmath179 mas  yr@xmath11 .",
    "a change of @xmath180 in the orientation of the line of nodes , implies a change of @xmath181 in @xmath175 , or @xmath182 mas  yr@xmath11 .",
    "these values are well below our uncertainties .    from fig .",
    "19 , top panel , it is clear that the counter - rotating disk model is disfavored by the observations , in fact it is discrepant at a @xmath183 level .",
    "the second solution proposed by o11 , is a disk inclined from the plane of the sky at @xmath184 , with a similar orientation of the line of nodes as in their first solution , and rotating in the same sense as the lmc disk .",
    "our proper - motions support this solution , as the sense of rotation is the correct one : positive slope in the run of @xmath156 with @xmath142 .",
    "the proper - motion amplitude should be larger than for prograde rotation with @xmath185 , since the inclination angle is smaller in absolute value , but only by @xmath186 mas  yr@xmath11 ( see above ) .",
    "the limiting case of a disk with @xmath187 and amplitude @xmath188 km  s@xmath11 is shown with a blue line .",
    "the proper motions imply prograde rotation in excess of 200 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "however , it is very likely that the motions of captured - smc stars are non - circular . that this may be the case ,",
    "is also implied by the run of @xmath155 with @xmath142 ( fig .",
    "19 , bottom ) .",
    "the observations disagree with all models at a @xmath189 level .    the escape velocity from the lmc at a distance of 2.5 kpc from its center ( @xmath190 , from fig .",
    "19 ) is @xmath191 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this is estimated by adopting a plummer potential for the lmc with a total mass of @xmath192 m@xmath62 , and a scale radius of 3 kpc ( db12 ) .",

    "however , we have a clear case of a recent interaction with the smc , which is responsible for the newly formed stars in the lmc s periphery , as well as captured - smc stars in the lmc .",
    "we also know that the recent star - formation history of the clouds is coupled , noting the recent study of the ages of young ( @xmath247 gyr ) clusters in the clouds by glatt et al .",
    "their study indicates that there were two periods of enhanced star formation in both clouds , and that these are nearly coincident : in the lmc at 125 myr and 800 myr , and in the smc at 160 myr and 630 myr . clearly , the recent epoch of enhanced star formation in both clouds is due to the recent interaction implied by the orbits .",
    "for the first time , we present the prospect of finding newly formed stars in the la .",
    "the existence of two ob - candidate clumps in regions of high h i column density in the la needs to be further explored spectroscopically for confirmation .",
    "the la is the most challenging structure to reproduce in models of the magellanic system , and as discussed by previous studies ( e.g. , db12 ) , the evolution of this material in the recent past ( 300 myr ) should be influenced by hydrodynamical interactions with the mw hot gaseous halo ( i.e. , ram pressure ) .      in order to explore their recent interaction ,",
    "we use the proper motions of the clouds as measured by k06 and v10 to integrate their orbits back in time as individual point masses in a realistic , three - component milky - way gravitational potential ( johnston et al . 1995 ) .",
    "we then calculate the minimum separation between the clouds ( impact parameter ) , the time as well as the relative velocity at minimum separation .",
    "we also calculate the angle between the relative velocity and the lmc disk at minimum separation .",
    "we assume the lmc s disk has an inclination of @xmath165 and the position angle of the line of nodes is @xmath166 ( e.g. , o11 ) .",
    "the present disk inclination corresponds to an orientation in galactocentric coordinates that is assumed not to change with time .",
    "as we are interested in the most recent interaction between the clouds , we integrate back in time for only 400 myr , compared to several gyr - period orbits ( or unbound orbits , besla et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we vary the input proper motions according to their formal errors , ( where for v10 we use the errors as obtained in the clouds relative proper - motion estimation , i.e. , @xmath248 mas  yr@xmath11 per cloud ) .",
    "distances , radial velocities and the clouds locations are taken from v10 .",
    "proper - motion errors are assumed to have a gaussian distribution ; the distances and radial velocities of the clouds are assumed to have zero errors .",
    "we integrate 1000 such realizations , and determine the range for the inner @xmath249 of the values .",
    "results are summarized in table 3 , where the first column indicates the reference to the proper - motion measurement , the second column shows the minimum separation and the third shows the time when the encounter occured .",
    "the fourth column shows the relative velocity at minimim separation , and the fifth column shows the angle between the relative velocity and the lmc disk , at minimum separation .",
    "rrrrr + & & & & + v10 & @xmath250 & @xmath251 & @xmath252 & @xmath253 + k06 & @xmath254 & @xmath255 & @xmath256 & @xmath257 +    we note that in the k06 tests , 47 realizations place the minimum separation in the future , i.e. , the clouds are currently approaching one another .",
    "also , the distribution of the minimum separation is rather flat between 9 and 20 kpc , and increases toward larger minimum separations . in the v10 tests , there are only 8 such occurrences , and the distribution of the minimum separation has a peak at @xmath258 kpc ; overall the v10 parameters are better constrained than those using k06 .",
    "this simple approach neglects dynamical friction of the clouds with the milky way and the gravitational interaction between the clouds .",
    "since the tidal radius of the lmc is @xmath259 kpc , the gravitational effect of the lmc on the smc will become important for separations smaller than this value .",
    "as such , our estimates of the minimum separation are to be regarded as upper limits .",
    "our simple approach indicates that the impact angle of the smc with respect to the lmc disk is @xmath260 away from being coplanar according to the v10 proper motions , and smaller assuming k06 ( table 3 ) . that the impact is not coplanar is also implied by our analysis of the o11 captured - smc stars , which favors the interpretation that thses to move in a plane inclined by @xmath3 from lmc s disk .",
    "to fully understand this interaction , n - body studies of both clouds in a realistic mw potential are needed .",
    "one such recent study is that of db12 , where the interaction is modeled after a preliminary thorough search in the orbital parameter space that was centered on the v10 proper motions .",
    "their search for a realistic model is further constrained by key observational facts such as the recent ( @xmath261 gyr ) formation of the binary pair necessary for the formation of the ms , the actual spatial distribution and kinematics of the ms , and the current positions and velocities of the clouds .",
    "the only drawback of this major study that aims to reproduce the ms , bridge , and smc morphology , is that the lmc s morphology was not captured , nor was it meant to be , in accordance with the initial goals of the study ; that is the smc is described by an n - body system , while the lmc and mw have analytic potentials .",
    "the best model of db12 places the most recent interaction at a minimum separation of 6.6 kpc some @xmath262 myr ago .",
    "we also mention the recent work by besla et al .",
    "( 2012 ) who use an n - body smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code to model the interaction , where both clouds are modeled as n - body / sph systems with disks , and the mw has a static potential .",
    "besla et al .",
    "( 2012 ) focus on describing the particular morphology of the lmc in light of a collision between the clouds that took place in the recent past .",
    "the lmc model has a bar before the interactions take place .",
    "however , their modeling does not reproduce the current position and velocity of the smc .",
    "the model is constrained by the orbit of the lmc as measured by k06 , and other facts that point to a recent interaction between the clouds . among these",
    "are : the coupled recent star - formation history of the clouds ( e.g. , harris & zaritsky 2009 ) , the off - center stellar bar in the lmc ( the center of the bar is offset by @xmath263 from the kinematic center of h i ; vdm02 ) , the bridge and its gaseous and stellar makeup , and the existence of captured - smc stars in the lmc ( o11 ) .",
    "their description of the interaction accounts for many features of the particular morphology of the lmc , with the most recent interaction having occured 100 myr ago and being a central collision at high inclination with respect to the lmc s disk .",
    "the questions that remain to be answered are related to the particulars of this interaction , such as impact parameter and impact angle with respect to the lmc s disk .",
    "these will determine many of the properties of the present day lmc , smc and bridge .",
    "we qualitatively explore the n - body / sph models by berentzen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that describe the interaction between a barred disk galaxy and a small ( @xmath17 mass of the disk galaxy ) spherical perturber .",
    "the gas amounts to @xmath264 of the disk mass .",
    "these models analyze nearly perpendicular passages with respect to the disk plane , and three impact parameters : central ( 0 kpc ) , minor - axis impact ( 3 kpc ) and major - axis impact ( 6 kpc ) .",
    "all these interactions produce expanding ring structures , off - center bars , spokes and other asymmetries in the stars and gas , and are unlike coplanar interactions that primarily influence the strength of the existing bar of the host galaxy ( berentzen et al .",
    "2004 ) . among the three classes of models presented by berentzen",
    "( 2003 ) , the central and minor - axis impact have their stellar bar destroyed in @xmath164 myr .",
    "this is not the case of the lmc , which has a strong bar seen in its m - giant population . in the major - axis impact , the stellar bar survives ,",
    "has its maximum displacement ( 2.4 kpc ) from the initial position 100 myr after impact , and recenters after 600 myr ( some two disc rotations ) .",
    "the impact produces a radially expanding density wave which becomes first visible in the gas .",
    "since the impact is off - center , the symmetry of the gaseous ring is broken when it encounters the stellar bar or spiral arms .",
    "nevertheless , gaseous density enhancements in ring - like shapes and at the ends of the bar appear to form ( see fig .",
    "17 and 22 in berentzen et al .",
    "2003 , see also simulations by bekki & chiba 2007 , their figs 4 and 5 ) .",
    "thus , the distribution of the ob candidates in the lmc s periphery , the timing of the interaction , and the characteristics of the bar point to an off - center collision of moderate to high inclination with respect to the host s disk .",
    "although the @xmath265 lower limit of the impact parameter is @xmath266 kpc from our simple analysis of the proper - motion data , this may not represent a problem when more realistic models are considered ( e.g. , db12 ) .",
    "the recent interaction of the clouds also tidally strips material from the smc disk in the form of gas and stars and forms the observed magellanic bridge .",
    "this is clearly seen in the recent work of besla et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and db12 , as well as in some earlier work .",
    "for the reasons mentioned above , we follow in more detail the prediction of the db12 work .",
    "they predict that the interaction at @xmath164 myr ago produced two tidal structures , one filling the region between the clouds , and representing the observed bridge , and the other  the counter bridge  extending away from the smc , but rather aligned with the line of sight to the smc , and thus hidden behind the smc .",
    "the simulations show that the counter bridge has an extent of @xmath267 kpc .",
    "it is known that the smc has a significant depth along the line of sight @xmath268 kpc ( subramanian & subramanian 2012 , crowl et al .",
    "2001 ) . here",
    "we suggest the possibility that the two branches of ob candidates extending from the western part of the smc wing and surrounding the cloud are part of this counter - bridge structure .",
    "spectroscopic information to secure distances and radial velocities is necessary to further explore this matter .",
    "the db12 model also predicts the existence of tidally stripped stars in the bridge .",
    "we note that the photometric study by harris ( 2007 ) that sampled twelve fields in the bridge , found no older stars .",
    "however , his fields were placed along the ridge line of the h i density , which appears to be offset from the ob candidates .",
    "one field , ( @xmath269 , ( ra , dec . ) = ( @xmath270 ) ) from his study was placed @xmath271 north from the h i ridge line , i.e. , closer to the location of our ob candidates .",
    "monelli et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reinvestigate two of the harris ( 2007 ) fields , including field @xmath272 with deep and wide - field photometry .",
    "their fig .",
    "3 shows a well - defined main sequence in field @xmath272 as well as in field @xmath273 , thus reinforcing the tidal nature of the bridge .",
    "based on photometry from galex , 2mass , spm4 and apass and on proper motions from spm4 , we select a sample of distant ( low proper - motion ) ob - type candidates in a 7900 square degree area , for the purpose of mapping recently formed stars in the magellanic clouds periphery and bridge , and to explore the presence of such stars in the leading arm and magellanic stream .",
    "we find a well populated lmc periphery with two prominent clumps at the ends of the lmc bar , and the northern side being more abundant than the south . in agreement with earlier work",
    ", we also find a rich smc wing that continues eastward in a narrow band toward the lmc to ra @xmath102 .",
    "this path is offset by @xmath2 from the h i ridge line in the bridge .",
    "a group of 2 - 3 candidates is present in the lmc periphery at r.a .",
    "@xmath274 in the direction of the band extending from the smc wing , and suggesting that this is the site where material from the smc is funneled into the lmc . the western part of the smc wing splits into two branches that partly surround the smc",
    "; they may be part of the counter bridge tidal structure produced in the most recent interaction between the clouds as modeled by db12 .",
    "we also find clumps of ob candidates in the la and coincident with high h i density regions .",
    "although these clumps are located at low galactic latitudes , the known spiral structure of the mw does not offer a compelling alternative explanation .",
    "a few isolated ob candidates are also seen in the ms .",
    "spectroscopic investigation of these candidates is most desirable .",
    "simple calculations based on the clouds proper motions suggest that the most recent interaction took place some @xmath275 myr ago , with an impact parameter between 9 and 18 kpc ( from the v10 proper motions ) .",
    "the sophisticated modeling by db12 indicates a similar impact time , with an impact parameter of 6.6 kpc .",
    "the orbits of the clouds , taken together with aspects such as the off - center lmc bar , the captured smc stars in the lmc ( o11 ) , and the configuration of the ob candidates in the lmc , imply that this interaction was an off - center , moderate to high - inclination collision between the smc and lmc s disk .",
    "we also analyze the spm4 proper motions of the radial - velocity sample from o11 of @xmath134 red supergiants , oxygen- and carbon - rich asymptotic giant branch stars and other giants .",
    "o11 showed that @xmath135 of these stars have distinct kinematics from the rotation of the lmc disk , and proposed that these stars are captured from the smc .",
    "o11 also show that the metallicities of 30 such stars are compatible with the metallicity of the smc s outer regions . under the assumption of circular motions ,",
    "o11 propose two kinematical solutions for the captured - smc stars : a counter - rotating disk , i.e. , similar plane with that of the lmc disk , and retrograde rotation , and a prograde rotation of a disk some @xmath276 away from the lmc disk plane , i.e. , at @xmath277 inclination with the plane of the sky .",
    "the proper motions indicate that 1 ) the captured - smc group is kinematically distinct from the lmc disk sample , 2 ) the counter - rotating disk solution proposed by o11 on radial - velocities alone is rejected at @xmath278 level , while their second solution of a prograde rotation at inclination @xmath277 appears to be a compatible description , although the assumption of circular motions may be unrealistic , and 3 ) the implied orbital velocities for the captured - smc star indicate a marginally bound status to the lmc .",
    "our proper - motion analysis thus reinforces the hypothesis put forward by o11 , that these are not bona fide lmc stars , but rather captured from the smc during their close interaction in the recent past ( e.g. , db12 and references therein ) .",
