    "the temperature gradient in solids causes the formation of an electrical potential difference .",
    "the effect performs direct transformation of thermal energy to electrical one . however , the development of new generation of thermoelectric generators based on quantum effects is complicated @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty while caring out an experiments on measuring the thermoelectric properties of systems of nano - sized scale is the invasiveness of measurements .",
    "that means that the applied temperature gradient causes local changes near the contact and should be taken into account while calculating the final result .",
    "furthermore , the electrical potential difference caused by the temperature gradient is very sensitive to the geometry of the contact .",
    "some attempts aimed to solve the problems resulted in sufficient improvement of thermoelectric figure of merit of bulk materials though were not good enough for practical purposes ( see refs .",

    "the study of thermoelectric properties of individual nanoobjects such as nanoclusters , nanotubes , nanofilms etc .",
    "is rather urgent .    in this paper for thermoelectric power value determination of pd and pt nanoclusters we used the original non - contact technique of recovery of thermoelectric power value of metal nanoclusters deposited on a surface of a conductive substrate @xcite .",
    "the technique is based on the analysis of tunnel current - voltage characteristics ( @xmath0-curves ) obtained by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) .",
    "an advantage of this technique is the lack of necessity of temperature measurements and samples heating , as well as the possibility of local study of single nanoclusters formed on the surface of the conductive substrates .",
    "thermoelectric power value of pd and pt nanoclusters formed by a pulsed laser deposition technique ( pld ) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) surface ( 0001 ) at room temperature was recovered and comparison with previous results on thermoelectric power value of au nanoclusters @xcite was made .",
    "it was found that the value of thermoelectric power of pulsed laser deposited nanoclusters depends on nanocluster s material and shows qualitative difference in size dependence for different materials of nanoclusters .",
    "thermoelectric power value of au and pd nanoclusters of volume more than 10  nm@xmath1 is typical for bulk materials , whereas for nanoclusters of volume of about 0.1  nm@xmath1 the absolute values of thermoelectric power of au and pd are several times greater in the absolute value compared with bulk materials .",

    "samples with pd and pt nanoclusters deposited onto hopg surface were prepared at the high vacuum conditions ( @xmath2 torr ) at room temperature with the use of pld technique implemented on the basis of xsam-800 ( kratos ) ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) spectrometer ( the detailed description of the experimental technique can be found in ref .",

    "the chemical composition of the hopg surface and pd and pt nanoparticles was controlled at the level of 0.1% by means of x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy in the uhv analysis chamber ( @xmath8 torr ) of the multiprobe  mxps  rm  v  afm-25 surface analysis system ( omicron ) .",
    "the size , shape and tunneling @xmath0-curves of the nanoclusters were determined by analysing the omicron uhv afm / stm lf1 scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) images . for this purpose , after the attestation of the chemical composition the sample was _ ex situ _ moved into the probe microscopy chamber of uhv surface analysis system .",

    "the choose of the volume for characterizing the size of nanoclusters was determined by the strongly irregular structure of nanoclusters formed by pld on the substrate surface @xcite that lowers the accuracy of linear size determination . in this case",
    "the volume as the parameter that characterizes the size of nanoclusters allows the correct comparison of tunnel @xmath0-curves of pld nanoclusters of different materials . before starting the discussion of the results obtained in terms of the thermoelectric properties of single nanoclusters",
    "let us discuss the essence of the proposed method of thermoelectric power value recovery of metal nanoclusters deposited on the substrate surface .",
    "the technique of thermoelectric power value recovery is described in detail previously @xcite . as differential tunneling conductance of metallic samples measured by sts technique depends on density of the electronic states ( dos ) and therefore contains",

    "then , from the analysis of experimentally measured tunneling current - voltage characteristics of the test metal samples , with known thermoelectric power value of platinum probe @xmath28 @xmath5v / k , one can restore the local value of the thermoelectric power value of the sample .",
    "the approximations used in this technique were discussed in original papers @xcite .    in this case in accordance with above - mentioned technique the dependence of averaged over the surface of the cluster differential tunneling conductance allows us to recover thermoelectric power value of the cluster @xmath13 of definite volume .",

    "the thermoelectric power value is typical for bulk materials ( @xmath29  @xmath5v / k , @xmath30  @xmath5v / k at room temperature@xcite ) . for nanoclusters of volume of about 0.1  nm@xmath1 the absolute values of thermoelectric power of au and pd",

    "thermoelectric power value of pt nanoclusters in volume ranges 0.5@xmath193 nm@xmath1 remains close to bulk value .",
    "the difference in differential tunneling conductance @xmath22 of au and pd nanoclusters might be caused by different electron structure of studied nanoclusters .",
    "indeed , according to the paper @xcite , dos behaviour at fermi - level is different for these two metals that leads to qualitative difference in differential tunneling conductance behaviour of au and pd nanoclusters and therefore difference in thermoelectric power . in this case for differential",
    "tunneling conductance ( and therefore thermoelectric power ) of pt nanoclusters the behaviour similar to pd nanoclusters should be expected for clusters size less than 0.5 nm@xmath1 .",
