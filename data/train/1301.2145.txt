    "the @xmath5-induced strong energy dependence of the scattering amplitudes @xmath9 arising in these calculations introduces a new feature into the analysis of @xmath1 atomic and nuclear systems as realized for @xmath1 atoms in the early 1970s @xcite .",
    "thus , in nuclear matter , approximated for @xmath10 by the lab system , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are binding energies , and where additional downward energy shift is generated by the momentum dependent term . unlike in the free - space @xmath0 cm system where @xmath15 , this term is found to contribute substantially in the lab system in realistic applications .",
    "therefore , a reliable model extrapolation of @xmath0 amplitudes into subthreshold energies is mandatory in @xmath1 atom and nuclear applications .    below",
    "i give a brief overview of works on kaonic quasibound systems and kaonic atoms where subthreshold @xmath7 amplitudes were used in a physically correct way during the last two years .",
    "it is shown how the energy dependence of these amplitudes , when translated into density dependence , leads to special patterns in kaonic systems .",
    "finally , i focus attention to the recently proposed @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath18 dibaryon around the @xmath19 threshold @xcite and suggest how to search for it in experiments that look for the @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath22 dibaryon , better known as @xmath23 . in lieu of a concluding section , conclusions are marked in boldface throughout this review .",
    "a prototype of such states is @xmath23 which stands for @xmath24 with isospin @xmath20 and spin - parity @xmath21 , dominated by @xmath25 and @xmath4 waves .",

    "all three displayed fits produce deeply attractive real potentials , with depth in the range 180200 mev at the center of ni , and sizable absorptivities measured by imaginary potential depths in the range 7080 mev .",

    "radius @xmath31=3.69  fm in ni , reflecting the sizable contribution of the more compact re  @xmath32 , whereas the r.m.s radii of @xmath33 are all slightly larger than @xmath31 , reflecting the compensating effect of i m  @xmath32 on the rapidly decreasing with density i m  @xmath34 .",
    "the very significant improvement of 30 units in @xmath35 values by going from nlo30 to ihw is due to species where strong interaction observables were measured for more than a single kaonic atom level .",
    "the width ( or equivalently ` yield ' ) of the upper level is normally dominated by i m  @xmath34 , whereas the width of the lower level is dominated by i m  @xmath32 . *",
    "thus , more accurate determination of two level widths in the same kaonic atom are likely to pin down the density dependence of i m  @xmath32 as it evolves with density and overtakes i m  @xmath34 . *",

    "the reverse is observed on the r.h.s . of the figure .",
    "this arises by requiring self consistency : the more excited a @xmath1 quasibound state is , the lower nuclear density it feels , and a smaller downward shift into subthreshold energies is implied by the @xmath62 dependence .",
