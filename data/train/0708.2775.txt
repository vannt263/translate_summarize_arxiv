    "behavior of the vortex system of coupled layered superconductors ( sc ) is one of the most interesting and difficult problem in the thermodynamics of quasi two dimensional ( 2d ) systems .",
    "it demonstrates dimensional crossover and other issues of dimensionality which are of perpetual interest in statistical mechanics .",
    "the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition @xcite in the 2d - vortex system was proposed to explain results of the experiment on measuring of the current - voltage characteristics of bisco monocrystal@xcite .",
    "such a type of transition takes place in 2d systems in which topological defects can exist .",
    "they can be considered as 2d coulomb particles whose interaction energy logarithmically depends on a distance between them . layered sc s without josephson coupling between layers are 2d systems .",
    "2d - vortices are topological defects in these systems .",
    "2d vortex - antivortex dipoles of a finite size can arise as thermal excitations at any temperatures and they dissociate into a gas of free vortices above bkt transition temperature @xmath0 .",
    "properties of these systems are investigated very well@xcite .",
    "but in real layered sc s layers are coupled due to the josephson effect .",
    "they can not be considered as 2d systems .",
    "simplest thermal excitations in coupled layered sc s arise in the form of two 2d - vortices of opposite orientation localized in the same layer which magnetic flux is closed by two josephson vortices or fluxons .",
    "the interaction energy of 2d - vortices in this case logarithmically depends on a distance for a small dipole size and asymptotically tends to linear dependence for a large size@xcite .",
    "investigation of such systems is much more difficult and less developed .",
    "one of the way which was used to analyze the problem consists in studying the thermodynamic of the system of classical particles with the pair interaction potential containing both logarithmic and linear terms ( see for example refs . [ ] ) .",
    "this approach takes into account the linear tension of josephson vortices as a portion of a two - particle interaction energy only while to describe the problem correctly it is necessary to take into consideration a josephson vortex subsystem as an independent participant of thermodynamic processes which has own configuration energy , entropy , self - energy and interacts with the 2d vortex subsystem .",
    "the other approach to the problem is to investigate the anisotropic 3d xy - model .",
    "it was shown that excitations of the same type as in coupled layered sc can exist in this model@xcite .",
    "the anisotropic 3d xy - model was studied numerically using monte carlo simulations@xcite and analytically@xcite .",
    "results of this investigations show that the model undergoes the phase transition of the bkt type at temperature @xmath1 higher then @xmath2 of a planar model and coupling of adjacent layers vanishes at the same temperature .",
    "the attempt to solve the same problem , which our work is devoted to , was made in ref .",
    "the authors base their approach on the quantum 1d sine - gordon model and use the connection of this model with the 2d coulomb gas system .",
    "the partition function of the model is represented in terms of a functional integral over two non - commuting variables .",
    "the model behavior is studied by means of a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) approach .",
    "the rg recursion relations ( rr ) derived in the work have not a fixed point .",
    "however , authors analyzing rr features come to conclusion that the system undergoes phase transition which temperature @xmath3 is controlled by 2d - vortex core energy .",
    "the other approach to the problem discussed was proposed by pierson and valls@xcite .",
    "the authors considered the model which they called a model of @xmath4 layers with lawrence - doniach ( l - d ) type interlayer couplings .",
    "it consists of 2d sine - gordon models in each layers and additional cosine terms with difference of phases of adjacent layers , which describe the josephson coupling . to study",
    "the model behavior authors used rg approach previously expanding the additional cosine term and keeping the quadratic summand only .",
    "the rg rr s have not a fixed point at a small value of the coupling constant but authors give arguments for existing of that at a larger value beyond the range of validity of rr s .",
    "from our point of view such an approach to analyze the model is inadequate to the problem discussed . as nndori",
    "et al.@xcite showed in the case of the quadratic interlayer coupling the model is equivalent to the system of classical particles with long - range pair interaction .",
    "so , such an approach excludes from consideration the contribution of the entropy of the josephson subsystem and the linear tension in the 2d - vortex interaction energy .    in this work",
    "we show that the model considered by pierson and valls@xcite follows from the l - d model@xcite in the london approximation and that its properties is determined by behavior of order parameter singular points of two kinds .",
    "they can be considered as classical coulomb particles which can be associated with 2d - vortices and the josephson subsystem .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the l - d model in the london approximation which describes the system of josephson vortices and transform it into the form available for further generalization . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce 2d - vortices in the l - d model and show the close analogy between the 2d - vortex and the josephson systems . in sec .",

    "ii and iii .",

    "v and vi by means of the rg approach and in the mean field ( mf ) approximation .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "we start from the l - d model@xcite in the london approximation in which fluctuations of the order parameter modulus responsible for transition in a superconducting state are neglected . in this case",
    "the order parameter is normalized so that its modulus is unit and does not depend on coordinates .",
    "such a model describes only the system of josephson vortices in a layered superconductor because 2d - vortices are associated with singular points in which the order parameter turns into zero . in this section",
    "we transform the model into the form suitable for its generalization and discuss briefly its thermodynamic properties .",

    "this point can mimic a fixed point for experimental purposes .",
    "the properties of models which demonstrate similar behavior were investigated by zumbach@xcite .",
    "he termed such a situation as an `` almost second order phase transition '' .",
    "from such a point of view we can suppose that the model asymptotically behaves almost the free fluxon and the 2d - vortex systems in regions of low ( @xmath101 ) and high ( @xmath46 ) temperature and demonstrates the crossover from low temperature @xmath114 behavior to high temperature @xmath115 one in vicinity of temperature @xmath116 corresponding to a slow point .",
    "the turning points of trajectories of different kinds ( 1 - 4 in fig.[fig3 ] ) draw together in close vicinity of a slow point .",
    "this allow us to evaluate the position of this point .",
    "direct numerical calculation of trajectories passing in the vicinity of slow point shows that such a point corresponds to @xmath117 .",
    "the crossover temperature which can be obtained from this relation obeys the equation @xmath118    but a perturbative rg is not a very good approach to find a slow point because the position of this point can be dependent on a cut - off procedure .",
    "so , the expression ( [ e5.4 ] ) can be considered as a rough evaluation of the crossover temperature only .",
    "the fact in which we can be sure is that @xmath119 or the same @xmath120 .    in completion of the section we note that a rg approach is the examination of the hypothesis about a scaling invariance of the model . in the case",
    "considered the rg does not have a fixed point and , thus the hypothesis is not prove to be true , in contrast to the independent 2d - vortex and fluxon models .",
    "in this situation we have to use a different approach to understand reasons of the scaling invariance breaking and to investigate the model behavior in more details .",
    "this is a subject of the next section .",
    "in this section we will consider the model as a two subsystems of classical particles with the long - range coulomb interactions ( [ e2.6 ] ) and ( [ e3.2 ] ) interacting with each other . to obtain the free energy of the model in a mf approximation we use the method developed in ref .",
    "[ ] . this method corresponds to the ring approximation in the case of the coulomb gas@xcite .",
    "the system free energy obtained is a function of concentrations of both 2d - vortices ( @xmath32 ) and fluxon particles ( @xmath65 ) . under the assumption that the system is neutral ( @xmath121 ) the free energy takes the form    @xmath122    the condition of a minimum of the free energy is two equations in equilibrium concentrations @xmath123    the solutions of the equations obtained",
    "numerically are shown in fig.[fig4 ] as temperature dependence of the equilibrium concentrations of the 2d - vortices and fluxon particles by solid lines for more anisotropic system ( @xmath47 ) and by dotted lines for less anisotropic ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "these concentrations always are above the corresponding values of the independent subsystems , which are plotted by the dashed lines , and in contrast to those are finite at any temperatures in the whole region @xmath124 .",
    "this result is easy to understand .",
    "there is bkt phase transition in the independent systems of 2d - vortices and fluxon particles .",
    "the mechanism realizing the transition is follow . a single 2d - vortex ( fluxon particle ) in an infinite sample",
    "has infinite energy . as a result of this",
    "such a particle can not appear in the system as a thermal fluctuation at low temperature @xmath101 ( high one @xmath46 ) .",
    "but in a many body system the competition between the configuration energy and entropy terms in the free energy ( see eqs .",
    "( [ e2.10 ] ) and ( [ e3.10 ] ) ) at @xmath0 ( @xmath59 ) leads to instability of a zero concentration state and to appearance of a finite concentration of free 2d - vortices ( fluxon particles ) .",
    "these particles differ from single ones mentioned above because they have a finite energy due to debye screening .",
    "such free vortices ( fluxon particles ) are , in fact , quasi - particles and can appear in the system as thermal fluctuations .     and by dotted lines for the low anisotropic one @xmath66 . dash and dash and dot lines show asymptotical solutions eqs .",

    "the model discussed describes systems of 2d - vortices and fluxon particles interacting with each other . in the case of coulomb particles",
    "the interaction leads to their mutual screening .",
    "thus , a finite concentration of 2d - vortices ( fluxon particles ) at low temperature @xmath101 ( high one @xmath46 ) exists due to screening of them by fluxon particles ( 2d - vortices ) .",
    "this supposition is easy to verify .",
    "the equilibrium equations ( [ e6.2 ] ) can be simplified in the vicinity of @xmath67 ( @xmath125 ) due to condition @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "asymptotical solutions of the equation take the form @xmath128 in the vicinity of @xmath67 and @xmath129 close to @xmath125 .",
    "the solutions obtained make a clear sense .",
    "the concentration @xmath65 in ( [ e6.3 ] ) coincides with that in the independent fluxon system ( [ e2.11 ] ) .",
    "this is sequent of a very small concentration @xmath32 of 2d - vortices at low temperatures @xmath130 , which can be neglected in comparison with @xmath65 .",
    "the concentration of 2d - vortices @xmath32 in the limit considered is just the boltzmann expression @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the vortex energy containing two terms .",
    "second term is the vortex core energy @xmath98 .",
    "first one is the energy of a 2d - vortex which diverges logarithmically in the case of a single vortex but is limited by the screening length @xmath133 due to a finite concentration @xmath65 of fluxon particles , @xmath134 .",
    "( [ e6.4 ] ) has an analogous structure : the 2d - vortex concentration @xmath32 coincides with that in the independent system eq .",
    "( [ e3.11 ] ) and the concentration @xmath65 is defined by the self - energy of a fluxon particle screened by a finite concentration of 2d - vortices , @xmath135 .",
    "asymptotical temperature dependencies of the concentrations of the particles of both kinds are in a good agreement with the numerical solution .",
    "the concentrations of 2d - vortices and fluxon particles of independent systems are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] by dashed lines .",
    "asymptotical dependencies of concentrations of 2d - vortices at low temperatures and fluxon particles at high temperatures are shown by dash and dot lines .",
    "it is seen that asymptotical behavior of the model at @xmath136 and @xmath137 is very close to that of the independent 2d - vortex and fluxon systems .",
    "the concentrations @xmath32 at @xmath138 and @xmath65 at @xmath46 are exponentially small but finite .",
    "this means that there is no a phase transition in the model discussed but there is a crossover from 3d to 2d type of behavior which takes place in the temperature interval @xmath139 .",
    "thus results obtained in the framework of the mf approximation agree quantitatively with that of the rg analysis . in terms of the mf approximation",
    "they are conditioned by mutual screening of particles of two kinds .",
    "the rg considers this as breaking of the scaling invariance of the model .",
    "now we can see that the reason which leads to this is existence of two competitive lengthes , namely , the screening lengthes @xmath140 and @xmath133 .",
    "we constructed and studied the model of the vortex system of coupled layered superconductors which is based on the l - d one .",
    "the main idea is to consider the josephson and 2d - vortex subsystems as the systems of singular points defined by the conditions ( [ e2.7 ] ) and ( [ e3.1 ] ) . such an approach becomes possible because both singularities interacts according to the 2d coulomb law .",
    "so , they can be interpreted as classical massless coulomb particles which are characterized by their charges and have different structures .",
    "the model partition function can be represented either as a grand partition function of the system with a variable number of particles of two kinds ( [ e4.1 ] ) or as a that of the field model ( [ e4.2 ] ) .",
    "the model was examined by means of the perturbative rg approach and the mf approximation .",
    "results obtained by both methods agree qualitatively with each other .",
    "both approaches show that there is no phase transition in the model in the whole temperature interval @xmath124 were the model is defined .",
    "but the model behaves asymptotically at @xmath136 and @xmath137 as independent 2d - vortex and josephson systems .",
    "crossover from low - temperature 3d behavior to high - temperature 2d one takes place in the interval @xmath139 .",
    "the effect of anisotropy can be cleared by means of comparing of temperature dependencies of free particles concentrations of systems with different value of the parameter @xmath55 in fig .",
    "one can see that more anisotropic system ( @xmath47 ) behaves closer to that of independent 2d - vortex and fluxon particle systems than less anisotropic ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "if the layered system is anisotropic enough it can mimic the bkt phase transition for experimental purposes .",
