    "parametric resonance is a fundamental physical phenomenon that is encountered eventually in every area of science . in different disciplines , however , different facets of this rich phenomenon play a major role and are highlighted .",
    "parametric instability and multistable regimes in nonlinear dynamics @xcite , noise driven transitions among stable states in statistical physics @xcite , wave mixing and frequency conversion in wave dynamics @xcite are topics of primary interest . in electrical and optical engineering",
    "the low - noise properties of parametric amplifiers attract attentions , as well as non - classical statistical properties of the electromagnetic field generated by parametric devices @xcite .    in superconducting electronics ,",
    "the idea of using josephson junctions for quantum limited parametric amplification is under attention and development since the 1980s @xcite . during the last years the field revived by challenges of quantum information technology .",
    "the circuit - qed design , initially proposed for qubit manipulation and measurement @xcite , was employed for developing a variety of parametric devices @xcite .",
    "the circuit - qed approach is based on a combination of extended linear electromagnetic elements ( transmission lines and resonators ) with josephson junctions as nonlinear lumped elements .",
    "the design is flexible , allowing for diverse methods of parametric pumping , phase preserving and phase sensitive amplification schemes , different numbers or input and output ports , distributed josephson nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "the most of developed amplifiers are engineered in such a way that the dominant pump tone is sent through the same port as the signal , and parametric resonance is achieved by mixing them in nonlinear josephson elements .",
    "a different method is available for tunable superconducting cavities  @xcite .",
    "the device consists of a resonator terminated with one ( or more ) dc - squid(s ) that determines the reflection condition at the cavity edge and hence the cavity resonance spectrum .",
    "parametric resonance is achieved by rapid modulation of a magnetic flux through the squid with an appropriate frequency .",
    "a number of interesting parametric effects have been observed with such a device : phase sensitive amplification  @xcite , frequency conversion  @xcite , radiation and multistability regimes above the parametric threshold  @xcite , quantum entanglement of output photons  @xcite , generation of photons out of vacuum noise  @xcite - an analog of the dynamical casimir effect  @xcite .    in this paper we formulate a consistent theory of parametric resonance in a tunable superconducting cavity .",
    "we aim at a unified picture of the phenomenon below and above the parametric threshold . to this end",
    "we include into consideration the squid nonlinearity , and damping due to connection to a transmission line .",
    "the latter provides a stage for studying the parametric amplification .",
    "we develop a full nonlinear description of the cavity resonance dynamics and the amplification effect in the classical limit , and study small quantum fluctuations of amplified and radiative fields . for certainty",
    "we consider parametric excitation of the main cavity mode @xmath0 by pumping with a frequency @xmath1 close to twice the cavity resonance , @xmath2 .",
    "the overall picture of nonlinear parametric resonance in the tunable cavity is rather rich and complicated . at very small pump strength the cavity intrinsic dynamics resembles the one of the duffing oscillator @xcite showing a bifurcation of the cavity response and bistability .",
    "however , the scattering of an external incidental wave is qualitatively different from the duffing case : the scattering is inelastic , the reflected wave undergoes amplification or deamplification depending on the phase shift between the input tone and the pump ( phase sensitive amplification ) .    with increasing pump strength , the amplification effect increases , and at the same time the resonance narrows such that the bifurcation occurs at ever smaller input amplitudes . eventually ,",
    "while approaching the parametric threshold , the cavity response becomes nonlinear at any small input amplitude .",
    "further increase of the pump strength leads to an instability of the cavity zero - amplitude state and the formation of finite - amplitude states accompanied by stationary parametric radiation at the half frequency of the pump .",
    "the radiative states are bistable in a certain window of detuning of the pump frequency from the cavity resonance . outside of this interval at red detuning",
    "the radiative states coexist with the stable zero - amplitude state ( tristability ) , and the latter one becomes dominant at far red detuning .",
    "remarkably all these multistable regimes have been observed in experiment with a high quality tunable cavity @xcite .",
    "the multistability regimes are accompanied by random jumps among the stable states induced by thermal or quantum noise .",
    "these large amplitude fluctuations have small probability away from the bifurcation points and the parametric threshold , but become significant in the vicinity of these critical points ( cf .  ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "these effects are out of the scope of this paper , here we restrict to small quantum fluctuations around well defined classical states outside of the critical regions , both below and above the parametric threshold .",
    "the bifurcation of the duffing oscillator response is employed in josephson bifurcation amplifiers ( jba ) for dispersive qubit readout @xcite .",
    "this method also applies to the parametric regime below the threshold ( josephson parametric bifurcation amplifier , jpba ) .",
    "the novel feature here is the possibility to measure _ amplitude _ of the amplified probing tone , which exhibits strong dispersion with respect to the detuning near the threshold , and can be advantageous for high fidelity qubit readout .    the parametric radiation above the threshold offers yet another strategy for the qubit readout based on the significant contrast between the strengths of the output radiation above the threshold and the amplified noise below the threshold .",
