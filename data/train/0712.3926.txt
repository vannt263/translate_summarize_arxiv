    "neutrinos are one of the most intriguing and fascinating fundamental particles , which make up the universe .",
    "however , they are also one of the least understood particles . studies of neutrinos have played a crucial role in the understanding of elementary particle laws and their interactions .",
    "three types of light neutrinos are known .",
    "the recent observation of neutrino oscillations @xcite has now beyond doubt established the non - zero masses of neutrinos , the flavor change and neutrino mixing .",
    "it has opened a new excited era in neutrino physics and represents a big step forward in our knowledge of neutrino properties and serves as solution of many problems in cosmology , elementary particle physics , and astrophysics .",
    "while neutrino oscillation experiments are sensitive only to differences of squared neutrino masses , the neutrino mass measurements with tritium ( @xmath2 ) and rhenium ( @xmath3 ) @xmath0-decays yield direct information on the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "the idea underlying the measurement of neutrino mass is actually fairly obvious .",
    "a long time ago , it was already pointed out by e. fermi @xcite that the shape of the electron spectrum in nuclear @xmath0-decay , near the kinematical end point , is sensitive to the neutrino mass .",
    "attempts to evaluate the rest mass of the neutrino experimentally were already being undertaken long ago . in 1940",
    "one of the first kinematical measurements of neutrino mass was performed by hanna and pontecorvo @xcite with a proportional chamber filled with tritium .",
    "a limit of @xmath4 on the neutrino mass was obtained , which was determined by the resolution of the detector .",
    "the mainz @xcite and troitsk @xcite tritium @xmath0-decay experiments using the magnetic adiabatic collimation technique , place the present upper limit on the mass of the electron neutrino of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the best published calorimetric limit to the electron neutrino mass obtained from the @xmath0-spectrum of @xmath7 is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we note that the bounds on neutrino mass imposed by the shape of the spectrum are independent of whether neutrino is a majorana or a dirac particle .",
    "a next - generation tritium @xmath0-decay experiment is the karlsruhe tritium neutrino experiment ( katrin ) @xcite , which is presently in construction phase ( it is planned to take data starting 2010 ) .",
    "this experiment is projected for measurement of the neutrino mass with a sensitivity of 200 mev , which will have important implications for the theory of neutrino masses .",
    "if the result will be positive , it will imply a degenerate spectrum of neutrino masses . on the other hand",
    ", a negative result will be a very useful constraint .",
    "there is also a chance that the planned mare experiment @xcite based on arrays of rhenium low temperature microcalorimeters will be able to achieve sensitivity lower than 0.2 ev in future .",
    "the mare approach would have totally different systematics with respect to the katrin .    in view of an enormous experimental progress in the field",
    "there is a request for a highly accurate theoretical description of the electron energy spectrum in the determination of the neutrino masses from the shape of the endpoint spectrum .",
    "the subject of interest has been molecular effects in tritium beta decay @xcite , radiative corrections @xcite , lorentz invariance violations @xcite , interactions beyond the standard model @xcite , relativistic form for the @xmath0-decay endpoint spectrum @xcite etc .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive the relativistic form for the @xmath0-endpoint spectrum in a hadron model .",
    "we shall take advantage of the fact that the nuclei @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the nuclear analogs of the neutron and the proton , i.e. , they form an isospin su(2 ) doublet . a correspondence to the commonly used formulae",
    "will be established .",
    "we note that the considered approach is known also as elementary particle treatment ( ept ) of weak processes , which was developed by kim and primakoff @xcite .",
    "by neglecting neutrino mixing for simplicity and taking into account only left - handed weak interaction , the electron energy spectrum for tritium @xmath0-decay is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fermi constant and @xmath13 is the element of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the momentum , energy , and maximal endpoint energy ( in the case of zero neutrino mass ) of the electron , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 denotes the relativistic coulomb factor .",
    "the transition is superallowed , a mix of fermi and gamow - teller transitions .",
    "the absolute square of the nuclear matrix element is given by @xmath18 where the fermi and gamow - teller matrix elements take the form @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the vector and the axial - vector coupling constants of the nucleon , respectively .",
    "we note that the derivation of the differential decay rate in ( [ eq:1 ] ) involves non - relativistic approximations and that only the @xmath22 states of outgoing leptons are taken into account",
    ".    the fermi matrix element can be evaluated by assuming the exact isospin symmetry as well as the fact that @xmath9 and @xmath10 form an isospin doublet @xmath23 ( the projection @xmath24 is assigned to the @xmath10 and @xmath25 to the @xmath9 ) with the result @xmath26 .",
    "the absolute square of the gamow - teller matrix element can be deduced from the ikeda sum rule by taking into account that the gamow - teller operator has no radial dependence and thus can not scatter into higher shells . in @xmath10 the 1s neutron level is already occupied by two neutrons and therefore in the transition @xmath27 to @xmath28 the neutron would need to be scattered into a higher orbit ( e. g. , 2s ) in the continuum , which is forbidden for the gamow - teller operator . thus only @xmath29 but not @xmath30 can contribute to the ikeda sum rule .",
    "in addition , there are no excited states of @xmath10 . as a consequence @xmath31 .",
    "this result is in a good agreement with the recommended value @xmath32 obtained in nuclear structure calculation @xcite .",
    "the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis proposed by feynman and gell - mann suggests that the vector coupling constant @xmath20 is not renormalized in the nuclear medium , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "the accurately measured @xmath0-decay lifetime of tritium ( @xmath34 ) @xcite is used to adjust the value of axial - vector coupling constant @xmath21 via the calculation of the theoretical half - life @xmath35 in the computation of the integral over the electron energy @xmath15 we adopted the relativistic coulombic factor @xmath17 @xcite , which take into account the finite size of the nucleus .",
    "for @xmath31 we found @xmath36 .",
    "the very good agreement between this result and the bare nucleon value @xmath37 @xcite suggests that the axial - vector coupling constant is only weakly quenched in the tritium .",
    "the dependence of spectrum shape on the mass of neutrino @xmath38 in ( [ eq:1 ] ) follows from the phase volume factors only .",
    "the traditional way to look at the @xmath0-spectrum data is to make a kurie plot , where @xmath39{1 - \\left ( \\frac{m_\\nu}{(e_0 - e_e)}\\right)^2}. \\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for zero mass neutrino , if @xmath40 is plotted against @xmath15 , the result is a straight line that crosses the @xmath15 axis at @xmath41 . for @xmath42",
    "the endpoint shifts to @xmath43 and the rate near the endpoint is depressed , namely the kurie plot has a kink at the endpoint . this distortion will be washed out at the experiment unless the energy resolution is comparable to @xmath38 .",
    "there are open questions related to the presented conventional approach for kinematical study of the @xmath0-decay endpoint of @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , it is not known what the consequences of the considered non - relativistic approximations are .",
    "further , the effect of the nuclear recoil is not taken into account .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the relativistic expression for the maximal electron energy @xmath44 , \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] gives a value about @xmath45 lower than the considered approximation @xmath46 @xcite ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are masses of the tritium atom , @xmath50 and the electron , respectively ) . in view of the planned sensitivity of @xmath51 of the katrin experiment",
    ", there is a request for a consistent relativistic description of the @xmath0-decay of tritium @xcite .",
    "we shall study the @xmath0-decay of tritium , @xmath52 in an analogy with the @xmath0-decay of a free neutron , @xmath53 as the spin - isospin characteristics of @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) nucleus and neutron ( proton ) are the same .",
    "the kinematics of the two processes above differ mostly due to different q - values and the coulomb corrections .",
    "the invariant @xmath0-decay amplitude is given by @xmath56 u(p_i ) .",

    "@xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are four momenta of the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , electron and antineutrino in the laboratory frame , respectively .",
    "the form factors @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 are real functions of the squared momentum @xmath66 .",
    "they are parameterized as follows : @xmath67 the two form - factor cut - offs @xmath68 and @xmath69 are in general different and their values are expected to be of the order of @xmath70 like it is in the case of nucleon form - factors . as it will be discussed",
    "later the @xmath66-dependence of these form - factors is not crucial for tritium @xmath0-decay .",
    "the conserved vector current hypothesis ( cvc ) implies @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 is calculated from the values of magnetic moments of @xmath9 and @xmath10 using the cvc hypothesis as well @xcite .",
    "the axial coupling constant @xmath73 can be determined from the measured half - life of @xmath9 .",
    "the induced pseudoscalar coupling is given by the partially conserved axial - vector current hypothesis ( pcac ) @xmath74 @xmath75 is the mass of pion .    for the spin - summed , lorentz - invariant squared amplitude we get @xmath76\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq:8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with    @xmath77    @xmath78    @xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81    @xmath82\\nonumber\\\\ + m_f \\left [   p_{e\\nu } ( p_{if}- m^2_i )   + p_{ei } ( p_{\\nu f } -2 p_{\\nu i } ) + p_{e f } p_{\\nu i }   \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath83    @xmath84    here ,",
    "@xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 denotes the scalar product of two four - momenta .",
    "the advantage of the presented formalism is that the squared lorentz invariant amplitude is calculated exactly unlike in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an assumption about its dominant constituent was considered .",
    "we note that for @xmath90 the squared amplitude is proportional to @xmath91 , i.e. , the structure is similar as , e.g. , in the case of the muon decay .    for the tritium @xmath0-decay at rest",
    "the differential decay rate is @xmath92 the factor @xmath93 in front of the squared amplitude stands for the average over the spin of the initial state .",
    "the subject of interest is the energy distribution of the electron .",
    "hence , the integration over antineutrino and final nucleus momenta have to be performed in ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "it requires calculation of the following integrals : @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the details of integrations with results are given in the appendix .",
    "the differential decay rate is found to be of the form @xmath97,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq:13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in the calculation we neglected @xmath66 dependence of the form - factors as for the @xmath0-decay of @xmath9",
    "the value of @xmath66 is rather small .",
    "their consideration would lead only to small correction factors , which are not sensitive to neutrino mass .",
    "we find not usefull to present here the explicit form of all @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) factors . instead of",
    "that we conclude about their structure and importance .",
    "our analysis showed that each term of @xmath100 is proportional to @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "so , a common @xmath103 can be put in front of the bracket in ( [ eq:13 ] ) by neglecting a small term @xmath104 .",
    "the importance of different @xmath100 contributions can be studied in the limit @xmath105 , @xmath106 and by making taylor expansion in in @xmath38 , @xmath49 ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "then we have @xmath111 .",
    "\\label{eq:15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in the brackets in ( [ eq:15 ] ) , which is quadratic in y , plays a subleading role . by keeping only the dominant contributions and by introducing a mass scale parameter @xmath112 instead of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we get @xmath113    for the relativistic form of the kurie function we can write @xmath114 with @xmath115 the unknown coupling constant @xmath73 of the hadron current is fixed to the half - life of @xmath116 @xcite with result @xmath117 .",
    "this value coincides well with that of the axial - vector coupling of the nucleon ( see previous section ) .",
    "we have @xmath118 .    by comparing the kurie function in ( [ eq:17 ] ) and ( [ eq:18 ] ) with the commonly used one ( [ eq:3 ] ) we find that they are equal",
    "if @xmath119 is replaced with @xmath120 and @xmath31 is assumed .",
    "this confirms what was generally expected , namely that the relativistic effects are small corrections to the results known in the traditional method due to a small @xmath121-value of the @xmath0-decay of tritium .",
    "however , it was not clear yet whether the recoil of the nucleus , which value is @xmath122 ev for maximal electron energy , affects the endpoint spectra , if sub ev mass of neutrino is measured . within the considered ept of @xmath0-decay of tritium we find that there is no significant modification of the shape of the electron spectra close to the endpoint due to the nuclear recoil .    in fig",

    "special attention is given to the effect of a small neutrino mass ( @xmath124 and @xmath110 ) .",

    "deviation from a straight line depends on the magnitude of neutrino mass @xmath38 .",
    "though , there is no difference with the previously known dependences , it is worth to stress that in this case the relativistic form of the @xmath0-decay kurie plot is used , which also takes the nuclear recoil ( @xmath126 ev ) into account .",
    "the neutrino absolute mass scale , which is very important for particle physics as well as for cosmology and astrophysics , can not be resolved by oscillation experiments .",
