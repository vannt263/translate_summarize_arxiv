    "the last enzyme of the respiratory chain of animal cells and bacteria , cytochrome @xmath0 oxidase ( cco ) , operates as an efficient nanoscale machine converting electron energy into a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient @xcite .",

    "thereafter , in a few microseconds ( @xmath310 @xmath4s ) , a major part of an electron density ( @xmath370% ) is transferred from the cu@xmath1 center to the low - spin heme @xmath5 ( fe-@xmath5 ) .",

    "the redox centers @xmath11 @xmath12 and cu@xmath8 , are located approximately at the same distance @xmath13 from the n - side of the membrane as heme @xmath5 .",

    "the proton path from the negative side of the membrane ( n - side ) toward the p - side ( for pumped protons ) and toward the binuclear center ( for substrate or  chemical \" protons ) goes through the residue @xmath14 ( for the @xmath15 enzyme @xcite ) .",
    "these residues are located at the end of the so - called d - pathway ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "a fraction of the substrate protons can also be delivered to the bnc via an additional k - pathway , which we will not consider here .",

    "one proton and one electron are consumed at the catalytic site to finally produce a water molecule around the bnc .",
    "it should be noted that kinetic phases with similar time scales ( @xmath21s@xmath22s@xmath23s ) have been revealed in other cco enzymes at various transition steps between the states of the enzyme @xcite .",
    "kinetic data obtained in experiments @xcite reflect important details of the still elusive proton pumping mechanism in cytochrome @xmath0 oxidase . to extract these details and gain a deeper insight into the operating principles of the cco proton pump , it is necessary to compare results of experiments with theoretical predictions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a simplified empirical valence bond ( evb ) effective potential was combined with a modified marcus equation to model time - dependent electron and proton transfers in cco in the range of milliseconds .",
    "however , this approach was applied to the single transfer event , not to the sequence of events , and the obtained time scale ( one microsecond ) differs by orders of magnitude from the experimental data ( about 100 microseconds ) .",

    "it should be emphasized , however , that many electron and proton transfers can be separated by only a nanosecond time scale , and , consequently , the experimentally observed kinetic rates comprise contributions of several almost - simultaneous individual electron and proton transfer events @xcite . correspondingly , an approach taking into account the kinetic inseparability of electron and proton transitions can be useful for understanding recent experimental findings @xcite .",
    "we note that kinetic coefficients used in the theoretical analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite were deduced from experiments without independent microscopic calculations of the heights of individual electron and proton barriers .    in the present paper , we analyze electron and proton kinetics in cytochrome @xmath0 oxidase within a simple physical model including four redox centers and four protonable sites electrostatically coupled to each other in the presence of a dissipative environment . using the master equation approach , we reproduce all four kinetic phases observed in ref .",

    "as in the real cco enzyme @xcite , the redox chain of the present model includes four centers : cu@xmath1 ( site @xmath27 ) , heme @xmath5 ( fe - a , site @xmath28 ) , heme @xmath7 ( fe-@xmath7 , site @xmath9 ) , and cu@xmath8 ( site @xmath10 ) , as schematically shown in fig .  1 . the transport chain for protons has four sites : @xmath16 ( presumably related to the residue @xmath14 near the end of the d - pathway ) , @xmath17 ( the pump site above the bnc ) , a protonable site @xmath18 placed on the way from the @xmath17-site to the p - side of the membrane , and , finally , a protonable site @xmath20 located in the proximity of the bnc and related to the oh@xmath19 ligand of cu@xmath8 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the sites @xmath10 and @xmath20 serve as final destinations for the injected electron and for the substrate proton , respectively .",

    "the electrostatic interaction between the redox ( @xmath39 ) and protonable ( @xmath40 ) sites plays a pivotal role in the electron - proton energy exchange .",

    "the obtained values of coulomb parameters correlate well with information about the distances between the active sites @xcite for reasonable values of the effective dielectric constants .    to describe the experimentally observed kinetic phases of the pumping process , we assume that the coupling , @xmath44 mev , between the copper ion cu@xmath8 and the catalytic site @xmath20 ( likely an oh@xmath45 ligand of cu@xmath8 @xcite ) and the coupling , @xmath46 mev , between heme @xmath7 and the pump site @xmath17 are higher than the electrostatic energies @xmath47 mev and @xmath48 mev .",

    "it is argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , that for the cu@xmath104 heme @xmath5 electron transition the reorganization energy must be in the range from 150 mev to 500 mev , which is much lower than the typical values of the reorganization energy for electron transfers in protein .",
    "the low values of electron reorganization energies ( @xmath105  4  kcal / mol ) have also been calculated for electron transfer reactions in _ rhodobacter sphaeroides _",
    "@xcite .    to reproduce the initial kinetic phases , we use the following tunneling energies : @xmath106ev , and @xmath107ev . the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 describe the electron transfers , which are coupled to the slower proton transitions characterized by the energy scales : @xmath110ev , and @xmath111ev .",
