    "the blue compact dwarf galaxy , 18 , was first described as `` a double system of compact galaxies '' having an emission line spectrum with a fairly featureless continuum ( zwicky 1966 ) .",
    "its extremely blue colors and exceptionally low oxygen abundance indicate the present star formation rate exceeds the past average rate ( searle & sargent 1972 ) .",
    "kunth & sargent ( 1986 ) have argued that the metal abundance in 18  o / h @xmath7 0.02 ( o / h)@xmath8 in the hii regions ( skillman & kennicutt 1993 and references therein )  is close to the minimum observable in any self - enriched , hii region .",
    "the prospect that 18 may be forming stars for the first time out of primordial clouds of gas has drawn much attention ( e.g. sargent & searle 1970 ; lequeux & viallefond 1980 ; kunth , lequeux , & sargent 1994 ) , and the galaxy has played a prominent role in determining the primordial he abundance ( lequeux 1979 ; davidson & kinman 1985 ; pagel 1992 ) .    the question of whether 18 formed stars prior to the current burst is not settled , but several recent results support the young galaxy hypothesis .",
    "the colors extracted from ubv imaging studies of blue compact dwarfs typically uncover an older stellar population underlying the starburst .",
    "however , comparable efforts for 18 show no evidence for an old population ( sudarsky & salzer 1995 ) .",
    "broadband hst images do resolve several spatially distinct populations within the main body of 18 , but again show no evidence for an older population ( hunter & thronson 1995 ) .",
    "the three continuum patches strung out to the nw of the main body have progressively redder colors and are probably associated with the galaxy ( davidson , kinman , & friedman 1989 ; dufour & hester 1990 ) .",
    "dufour & hester have speculated that the elements synthesized in these earlier , isolated star formation events escaped without significant mixing into the hi clouds .",
    "the c , n , and o abundances of the main hii regions are well described by a single burst that started about 10  myr ago and restrict models with previous star formation to a short burst at least @xmath9 years ago ( kunth , matteucci , & marconi 1995 ) .",
    "measurements of the metallicity of the hi gas ( kunth , matteucci , & marconi 1995 ; pettini & lipman 1995 ) should distinguish between these chemical evolution models , whose success relies on some primary production of n and a differential galactic wind ( marconi , matteucci , & tosi 1994 ) .",
    "although the structure of the and 21-cm emission has been described previously ( dufour & hester 1990 ; viallefonde 1987 ) , several important questions about the gas dynamics remain .",
    "for example , skillman & kennicutt ( 1993 ) have questioned the assumption that the hi velocity field reflects a rotating disk .",
    "the implied total mass is 13 times larger than the hi mass ( viallefond 1987 ) and causes 18 to deviate significantly from the mass - metallicity relation observed for dwarf irregular galaxies ( skillman 1988 ) .",
    "examining the velocity field on finer scales will determine the contribution of non - virial motions to the large - scale gas motions .",
    "another outstanding question is the role of a galactic wind .",
    "meurer ( 1991 ) has suggested that the emission extending roughly perpendicular to the main hi cloud is a minor axis outflow .",
    "it is important to substantiate this claim with supporting kinematic evidence .",
    "we selected 18 for a case study within a broader program investigating the interplay between star formation and the ism ( martin 1996 ) .",
    "the feedback could have a particularly strong influence on the evolution of 18 since the low metallicity reduces radiative losses and the escape velocity is relatively low .",
    "this paper presents new imagery and longslit echelle spectra of the emission and previously unreported emission (   [ sec : observe ] ) .",
    "the objectives are to describe the kinematics of the ionized gas (   [ sec : observe ] ) , derive a consistent dynamical interpretation (   [ sec : models ] ) , determine the implications for the star formation history of 18 (   [ sec : models ] ) , and estimate what effect mass loss is likely to have on the galaxy s evolution (   [ sec : discuss ] ) . since the results suggest superbubbles mix the interstellar gas on kiloparsec scales , we examine new optical spectra in ",
    "[ sec : chem ] and place limits on the o / h abundance variations in the extended ionized gas .",
    "the results are summarized in   [ sec : sum ] .",
    "narrowband and red continuum images of 18 were obtained 1993 may 17 with the steward observatory 2.3  m telescope equipped with a loral @xmath10 thinned ccd .",
    "the raw ccd frames were processed with standard techniques as described in martin & kennicutt ( 1995 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : outer]ab show the continuum subtracted image .",
    "the nw hii region is centered about 1e of the brightest continuum emission . a small , partial shell of diameter 36 ( 175 pc ) protrudes from the nw side of the nw hii region and",
    "wraps around the continuum emission ( davidson 1989 ; hunter & thronson 1995 ) .",
    "the se hii region is coincident with the second brightest maximum in the continuum emission .",
    "the cores of both hii regions are offset ne of the two maxima in the hi map ( dufour & hester 1990 ) .",
    "the deeper reproduction in  1a reveals additional features absent in the off - band image .",
    "for example , the ridge to the sw is thought to represent a radiation - bounded ionization front being driven into the main hi cloud ( dufour & hester 1990 ) . a prominent shell stretches 15(740 pc ) n - ne from the nw hii region , and bright emission extends symmetrically s - sw of the nw hii region .",
    "faint , diffuse emission ( emission measure @xmath11 pc  @xmath12 for @xmath13  k ) is detected along a position angle of 42 in a band 21(1 kpc ) wide extending 25(1.2 kpc ) and 31(1.5 kpc ) to the ne and sw , respectively .",
    "the 21-cm emission is less extended in this direction ; the principal 30by 60hi cloud is elongated along the optical major axis , pa  @xmath7   328(viallefond 1987 ) .",
    "[ fig : outer ]    the image was flux calibrated using the absolute flux reported by dufour & hester ( 1990 ) through a 1@xmath14 1square aperture centered on the nw hii region .",
    "absolute fluxes were corrected for atmospheric extinction and foreground galactic reddening ( @xmath15 = 0.21 mag ) ; the contribution of [ nii ] lines is negligible . the integrated flux within 30of the nw hii region is @xmath16 , where the 20% uncertainty is dominated by the flux calibration .",
    "assuming the nebula is radiation - bounded , case  b conditions , and an electron temperature @xmath17  k ( e.g. skillman & kennicutt 1993 ) , the flux of hydrogen ionizing photons is @xmath18  s@xmath1 , where @xmath19 is the distance to 18 in units of 10  mpc .",
    "this ionizing luminosity is similar to that of 30  doradus in the large magellanic cloud ( kennicutt 1984 ) .",
    "a spherical , homogeneous nebula of this size would have an rms electron density of @xmath20  @xmath6 .",
    "the ratio of the 2 line fluxes is near the low density limit , so the actual electron density in the emission line filaments is @xmath213 .",
    "the volume filling factor of the ionized filaments must be at least @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the estimated mass of ionized gas is then @xmath24 . to estimate the radial density profile ,",
    "the surface brightness was azimuthally averaged in annuli around the nw hii region . assuming the nebula is spherical , inversion of the surface brightness integral implies @xmath25 within 7(340  pc ) of the nw hii region , and @xmath26 between 7and 15(730  pc ) .",
    "longslit spectra of the line were obtained 1994 april 29 and 30 using the echelle spectrograph on the kpno 4  m telescope .",
    "three position angles were chosen based on the morphology of the emission ( see  [ fig : outer ] ) .",
    "an astrometric offset was used to center the slit on the nw hii region , and three 20 minute integrations were obtained at each position angle .",
    "the 15 slit produced a spectral resolution of @xmath27fwhm .",
    "the instrumental setup , calibration techniques , and data reduction are further described by martin and kennicutt ( 1995 ) .",
    "the seeing varied from 1 - 2fwhm , so spectra were extracted every 18 along the slit to maximize the spatial information .",
    "this binning provided sufficient s / n to measure the line center to an accuracy of 0.1    and fit two - component gaussian line profiles down to the faintest intensities visible in  [ fig : outer]a .    the echellograms reveal the kinematic signatures of two expanding supergiant shells .",
    "figure  [ fig : slit1 ] shows the echellogram along slit 1 , pa = 7.7 . southwest of the nw hii region ( continuum source ) , the line profile splits into two components forming a doppler ellipse .",
    "similar kinematic signatures have been observed in other starbursting , gas - rich dwarfs and almost certainly indicate the presence of an expanding shell of gas ( marlowe 1995 ; martin 1996 ) .",
    "this doppler ellipse extends 19(930  pc ) to the sw , and the maximum separation of the line - of - sight velocities reaches 59 .",
    "fits to the line profile northeast of the hii region are improved with a faint , secondary component redward of the main component , thereby providing some evidence for a second doppler ellipse coincident with the ne shell in the image .",
    "the asymmetry in the line profiles of these shells suggest the superbubbles form the two lobes of a bipolar bubble with polar axis inclined relative to our line - of - sight . in the ne doppler",
    "ellipse the intensity of the blueshifted component is several times higher than that of the redshifted component , but their relative intensities are reversed to the sw .",
    "this effect is illustrated in  [ fig : ha_pv ] , where the symbol `` x '' denotes the position of the weaker component in position - velocity space .",
    "the lack of line - splitting along the other slit positions lends credence to the bipolar bubble interpretation .",
    "we also detect gas with velocities up to @xmath28from the systemic velocity and tentatively associate it with the small shell .",
    "these high - velocity wings are stronger on the blue side of the line profile and coincident with the small shell along all three slit positions . however , since this high - velocity component contributes only 5% of the line flux , the only other region with high enough signal - to - noise to reveal these wings is the se hii region ; and examination of the data along slit  2 shows a similar wing contributes 3% of the flux there . we hesitate to identify the high - velocity gas with an expanding shell because no doppler ellipse is seen where slit  3 crosses the center of the small shell . a champagne flow",
    "( e.g. yorke , tenorio - tagle , & bodenheimer 1984 ) from the young hii regions and stellar winds might provide a better description of the gas kinematics .",
    "the detection of large , expanding shells of gas reopens the question of whether galactic rotation produces all the velocity shear across the gas distribution . in  [ fig : ha_pv ] the solid circles trace the velocity of the dominant component of the emission along each of the three slit positions .",
    "along slit 1 , the velocity is fairly constant to the ne but increases by @xmath29to the sw .",
    "at least part of this velocity shear is likely an artifact of the expansion of the superbubble .",
    "along slit 2 , pa = 156.1 , the velocity gradient is steeper on the se side of the nebula .",
    "since this slit position is nearly parallel to the hi major axis , it might be expected to reveal the galactic rotation curve . however , the change in slope near the nw hii region and the similarity to the velocity gradient along slit  1 leave some ambiguity between the effects of galactic rotation and the expansion of the superbubble .",
    "the velocity is nearly constant along slit  3 , pa = 78.8 , which is 24from the hi minor axis .",
    "along all three slit positions , the large - scale variations in the central velocity of the line appear to be shared by the hi velocity field ( viallefond 1987 ) . given the better spatial coverage of the hi map and the strong suggestion of galactic rotation in it , we provisionally attribute the velocity gradient across echelle slit  2 to galactic rotation .",
    "higher resolution hi observations are needed to determine whether the kinematic signatures of the bubbles are present in the hi and what affect they might have on the global hi velocity field .",
    "a significant perturbation on the local velocity field is already evident in the ne finger of hi , which is coincident with our large shell .",
    "the iso - velocity contours there depart from the overall pattern , and the hi radial velocity decreases by about 20across the shell .",
    "18 was observed with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) on the rntgensatellit ( rosat ) for 16,964 sec during 1992 april 30 - 1992 may 11 .",
    "we requested the data , originally obtained by dr .",
    "c. motch , from the rosat public archive .",
    "an unresolved source is located 26 w and 66 s of the peak red continuum emission .",
    "pointing errors of this magnitude are typical for rosat observations , and we identify the source with 18 .",
    "it is not clear whether a second , fainter source located 82to the nnw is associated with 18 .",
    "after background subtraction , the remaining @xmath30 net counts are insufficient to constrain a spectral fit .",
    "the colors , however , suggest a fraction of the flux is produced by hot , coronal gas in the ism .",
    "the emission is slightly harder than the soft emission from the dwarf 5253 ( martin & kennicutt 1995 ) , but considerably softer than the hard sources , thought to be massive binaries , near the center of 2403 ( martin 1996 ) . to estimate the luminosity , @xmath31 , in the rosat band ( 0.1  2.2 kev ) , a series of power law , bremsstrahlung , and raymond - smith spectral models were normalized to the total counts . for a galactic absorbing column @xmath32  @xmath33 ( heiles 1975 ; stark 1992 )",
    ", all these models produce @xmath34to within a factor of two .",
    "for example , a raymond - smith model for a @xmath35  k plasma of 10% solar abundance with a foreground absorbing column of @xmath36 implies @xmath37  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "until rosat hri observations are obtained , the extent of the source will remain unknown . at 1",
    "kev the fwhm of the rosat / pspc point spread function is 24 , about half the angle subtended by the emission along slit  1 . however , the radius encircling 95% of the photons is substantially larger ",
    "about 45(hasinger 1992 )  so a diffuse halo should not be ruled out .",
    "if the source is found to reside deep within the galaxy , the intrinsic absorption column could be as high as @xmath38  @xmath33 ( kunth 1994 ) ; and the estimated luminosity would be increased by a factor @xmath39 , where the upper limit is derived for a column with solar abundances .",
    "in this section , a simple model for a wind - blown bubble is used with the kinematic and morphological properties described in   [ sec : observe ] to constrain the dynamical age of the superbubble and the mechanical energy supplied to it .",
    "the luminous properties of a starburst which could drive the expansion are computed and compared to the integrated properties of the galaxy .",
    "the dynamical arguments presented in this paper are based on the standard model for a stellar wind bubble with a radiative shell ( e.g. castor , j. , mccray , r. , & weaver , r. 1975 ; weaver , mccray , & castor 1977 ) .",
    "the conceptual framework is illustrated schematically in  [ fig : cone ] .",
    "stellar winds and supernova explosions from hundreds of massive stars fuel a supergiant bubble over timescales @xmath40  yr ( zone 1 ) . the kinetic energy in the ensemble s supersonic wind is thermalized by a stand - off shock , and the high pressure ( zone 2 ) downstream drives a strong shock into the ambient ism ( zone 4 ) .",
    "the swept - up gas condenses into a shell ( zone 3 ) as a result of radiative cooling .",
    "the solution for the shell s evolution as formulated by ostriker & mckee ( 1988 ) provides a convenient power - law parameterization of a density gradient in the ambient medium , @xmath41 ^ { -\\kappa_{\\rho}},\\ ] ] and a time - dependent energy injection rate , @xmath42 ^ { \\eta_{in } - 1}.\\ ] ] in this notation , @xmath43 is the average density of the ambient ism within the fiducial radius @xmath44 , and supernovae and stellar winds supply a mechanical power @xmath45 at time t(1 ) .",
    "the parameters t(1 ) and @xmath44 are not independent and must satisfy the relation @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "the radius of the spherical swept - up shell is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are numerical constants on the order of unity as defined by ostriker & mckee ( 1988 ) and evaluated for a ratio of specific heats @xmath51 .",
    "the shell velocity is @xmath52 solving equations [ eqn : r ] and [ eqn : v ] gives the dynamical age of the bubble , @xmath53 and the ratio of the mechanical power to ambient density , @xmath54 the total mechanical energy injected into a bubble of age @xmath55 is @xmath56      the doppler ellipse discovered sw of the hii regions is not the signature of a spherical shell expanding radially .",
    "the measured radius and velocity would require a burst of star formation in the center of the bubble about 6  myr ago which supplied @xmath57  ergs of kinetic energy . the continuous emission from the fading population",
    "would easily be detected in our red continuum image .",
    "we favor interpreting the data in the context of an expanding bipolar bubble .",
    "the bright emission coincident with the sw shell shares a common symmetry axis with the ne loop , which may form the second lobe .",
    "this polar axis intersects the brightest region of the galaxy  the obvious place for a power source .",
    "the reversal of the shape of the line profile between the two bubbles also supports this interpretation since it is easily explained by tilting the bubble with respect to our line - of - sight .",
    "overall , the kinematic signature is reminiscient of that along the minor axis of m82 , which exhibits the quintessential superwind ( heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ; martin 1996 ) .",
    "however , while the outflow in m82 is clearly confined at its waist by the galactic disk , the collimating mechanism in 18 is not apparent .",
    "the polar axis presumably depicts the projection of the steepest pressure gradient , which we might expect to be perpendicular to the hi major axis .",
    "the proposed polar axis is 43from the pa of the hi major axis in the map of viallefond ( 1987 ) .",
    "we note that the major axis of the very diffuse , extended emission is perpendicular to the hi major axis .    to estimate the radius and expansion speed of the sw lobe from the data , we introduce two simplistic models for the shape and velocity field of the bipolar shell .",
    "a cone of half - opening angle @xmath58 and inclination @xmath59 , as illustrated in  [ fig : cone ] , represents the thick shell behind the outer shock .",
    "we assume the density decreases as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the distance from the starburst , which is consistent with the decline in surface brightness in our image .",
    "the inclination is not large because the shifts of the red and blue components of the sw doppler ellipse with respect to the central velocity are similar .",
    "we estimate @xmath62from the width of the ne loop .",
    "an inclination of @xmath63then produces an intensity contrast of 2  3 , similar to the data .",
    "the radial extent of the doppler ellipse is essentially the length of the polar axis . in our `` isobaric bubble '' model ,",
    "the shell velocity is normal to the conical surface , geometrical corrections are small , and we estimate an expansion speed @xmath64 .",
    "( the variations in the magnitude of the velocity around the shell is thought to be considerably smaller . ) in our `` wind '' model , the flow is radial , mimicking the boundary layer between a freely expanding supersonic wind and the halo , and the deprojected shell speed is @xmath65 .",
    "hence , the shell velocity is uncertain by a factor of 2 .",
    "the uncertainty in the radius is dominated by the difference , about 20% , between the two lobes .    despite the complex geometry , we apply the dynamical model of   [ sec : models ] along the polar axis . we expect to estimate the dynamical age to within a factor of two and @xmath66 to better than an order of magnitude based , primarily , on the uncertainties in radius , velocity , and density gradient ( @xmath67 ) rather than the choice of dynamical model .",
    "the magnitude of the errors are believed to be similar .",
    "for example , the height of the polar lobe is larger than the radius of a spherical bubble supplied with the same energy , but a radial density gradient could also easily increase @xmath68 by a factor of two relative to the constant density case .",
    "our best estimate of the dynamical age from the isobaric bubble and wind geometries are 27  myr and 15  myr , respectively .",
    "the bubble requires @xmath69  ergs of kinetic energy while the wind geometry increases the estimate to @xmath70  ergs .",
    "the mean density of the ambient ism swept up by the shell is expected to be low .",
    "if all the hi gas were compressed into a uniform sphere the size of the bipolar bubble ( @xmath71  kpc ) , the average density would be @xmath723 , where the number density @xmath73 and @xmath74  amu is the average mass per h atom for a composition h : he = 10:1 by number .",
    "adding the density of ionized h in the nebula (   [ sec : imaging ] ) yields an upper limit @xmath753 for the @xmath76 models .",
    "spreading the hi out uniformly over the hi clouds suggests a lower limit of @xmath773 @xmath78 . to explore the effect of a density gradient on galactic scales , we calculated models with @xmath79  and  2 and @xmath80  pc . by an analogous argument , the acceptable ranges for the ambient density interior to @xmath44 are @xmath813 and @xmath823 , for @xmath79  and  2 respectively .",
    "these central densities are similar to estimates of the hi density in the center of the main cloud ( @xmath833 ) and the rms electron density in the nw hii region .      either a recent starburst or an imf heavily biased towards massive stars can produce colors as blue as observed for 18 .",
    "searle & sargent ( 1972 ) ruled out the latter interpretation for 18 with a measurement of the gas phase o / h abundance ratio .",
    "recently the stellar content of the starburst has been studied using very high spatial resolution .",
    "stars down to o9.5 on the main sequence are resolved in broad - band , hst images ( hunter & thronson 1995 ) , and hunter & thronson identify three spatially distinct populations .",
    "first , the stars inside the small shell have ages from 1 5  myr .",
    "the second population in the southern component has no red supergiants ( rsgs ) and is probably younger .",
    "the third population is spread throughout the galaxy , comprises roughly half of the resolved stars , and is likely to be older than the shell population since it contains more red stars .",
    "in addition to this `` general galaxy '' population , an older , unresolved population with the colors of b or early a stars follows the main body of the galaxy and has an age @xmath40  myr .",
    "our detection of high velocity gas near the small shell confirms the observations of davidson ( 1989 ) and supports the conclusion of hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) that the shell population powers the small shell . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : echelle ] , our data do not unambiguously determine the expansion velocity of the shell .",
    "so , it remains unclear whether a few a massive stars that formed early created the shell , or whether a younger bubble is driven by many stars .",
    "the supergiant bubble is clearly older than the shell cluster .",
    "could its dynamical age indicate the duration of the starburst in 18  ? to check the consistency of this hypothesis , we use the evolutionary synthesis models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) to describe the photometric properties of a stellar population which could power the bubble .",
    "we adopt their lowest metallicity models , @xmath84 , and consider only an imf of slope @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "an instantaneous burst model is not a good description of the star formation history of 18 .",
    "a 15  myr old population that produced hydrogen ionzing photons at the observed rate would generate 300 times more blue luminosity than observed .",
    "a continuous star formation rate over the @xmath88  myr lifetime of the bubble seems reasonable ( cf .",
    "meurer 1995 ) and is consistent with the detection of stars only a few million years old ( hunter & thronson 1995 ) .",
    "up to an age @xmath89  myr , the mechanical power , @xmath90 , generated by this burst will grow with time as shown in  56 ( lower right ) of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) , and we incorporate this evolution in our dynamical model by setting @xmath91 and @xmath92  myr . the steep increase in the wind power keeps the shell moving at a constant velocity , which would also be obtained from a @xmath93 density gradient .    the continuous star formation model produces a stellar population whose photometric properties resemble 18 . as shown in table  2 , this result is not very sensitive to our choice of geometry as represented by the `` isobaric bubble '' and `` wind '' models . at dynamical ages of 15  myr and 27  myr , star formation rates of 0.021 ( of 1 to 100 stars ) and 0.017 , respectively , are required to generate the blue luminosity of 18 .",
    "these model populations produce only half of the ionizing luminosity measured and are a bit redder than 18 .",
    "this discrepancy is not bothersome as roughly 20% of the flux comes from the compact source on the eastern edge of the small shell .",
    "we could speculate that this star formation is an isolated , triggered event or that the global star formation rate is increasing",
    ". this population might be too young and hot to contribute substantially to the blue luminosity .",
    "the continuous burst models easily produce enough supernovae and stellar winds to drive the superbubble .",
    "after 15  myr and 27  myr , the kinetic energy imparted to stellar ejecta is @xmath94  ergs and @xmath95  ergs , respectively .",
    "since our echelle data constrain the ratio @xmath66 rather than @xmath96 alone , we can choose the ambient density , @xmath97 , to make our dynamical model consistent with the starburst model of the same age .",
    "the inferred densities , 0.033 and 0.363 , are within the range estimated from the hi data in ",
    "[ sec : geo ] .",
    "the aim of our modeling exercise was to describe the range of star formation histories that could easily explain the gas kinematics in 18 .",
    "uncertainties about the geometry of the superbubble and the distribution of the ambient gas limit the accuracy of our analysis .",
    "we stepped through the analysis for two models representing the likely range of shell velocities .",
    "we found that the star formation necessary to power the superbubble also produces most of the starburst s luminosity .",
    "this epoch of star formation probably started 15  27 myr ago .",
    "we favor a higher age within this range because our `` isobaric bubble '' model is probably the closer analogy to the actual shell kinematics and also predicts a volume - averaged ambient density closer to expectations .",
    "the evolutionary tracks for low metallicity , massive stars are controversial ( e.g. renzini 1992 ) and could introduce errors in the models for the young starbursts . near an age of 4  myr ,",
    "the blue luminosity of the 0.1instantaneous burst brightens 65% more than the solar metallicity models (  9 of leitherer & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "eliminating this jump would increase the ratio of ionizing luminosity to blue luminosity ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "since the error diminishes with age and an increase in @xmath98 would actually improve the agreement with the observations , a small error of this nature will not change our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we use our results from   [ sec : models ] to explore the influence of the superbubble on the evolution of 18 .",
    "a particularly interesting issue is the amount of global mass loss driven by the burst of star formation .",
    "it has been argued on a theoretical basis that a global wind created by the first burst of star formation may eject the interstellar gas from a dwarf galaxy ( e.g. larson 1974 ; saito 1979 ; dekel & silk 1986 ; vader 1986 ) .",
    "the transformation of gas - rich dwarfs to dwarf ellipticals by this mechanism is appealing but is not completely consistent with the systematic structural properties of dwarfs ( ferguson & binggeli 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "it has also been emphasized that the escaping wind should be enriched with metals recently dispersed in type  ii supernovae ( vader 1987 ; deyoung & gallagher 1990 ) .",
    "these differential galactic winds have been independently invoked to explain the locus of blue compact and dwarf irregular galaxies in the n / o - o / h and he / h - o / h planes ( marconi , matteucci , & tosi 1994 ) . in   [ sec : massloss ] , we discuss the conditions necessary for the bipolar bubble to develop into a galactic wind , the escape of the hot gas from the galaxy s gravitational grip , and the mass of cooler gas permanently ejected . in   [ sec : chem ] , we discuss the mass of metals produced by our starburst models and the role of the superbubble in mixing these elements into the interstellar gas . in   [ sec : pilot ] , measurements of o / h abundance variations are presented and discussed .",
    "the power requirement for the superbubble to break free of the ism is characterized by the minimum mechanical power , @xmath99 , necessary for the bubble to grow as large as the gaseous extent of the galaxy . following the derivation of koo & mckee ( 1992 ) , in which the effective scale height is defined by @xmath100",
    "the critical rate of kinetic energy injection is @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the isothermal sound speed and midplane gas density in the ambient medium .",
    "since @xmath102 is intended to serve as a measure of the pressure in the ism , we interpret @xmath102 as the effective one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the hi gas .",
    "the velocity dispersions measured in galactic disks typically fall in the narrow range from 3  10(kennicutt 1989 ) , consistent with estimates of 8for the galactic disk ( mckee 1990 ) .",
    "the hi linewidth provides an upper limit of @xmath104(kunth 1994 ) . from hi observations ( viallefond 1987 ; lequeux & viallefond 1980 ) , we estimate a scale height @xmath105  pc . in units of @xmath106and @xmath107  pc ,",

    "[ sec : models ] were supplied with kinetic energy at time - averaged rates of @xmath111and @xmath112 after 27  myr and 15  myr , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the bipolar bubble will likely break through the hi layer supersonically .    to open a channel for the hot gas inside the bubble to flow out of the galaxy ,",
    "the shell must accelerate and break up from rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "mac low & mccray ( 1988 ) and mac low , mccray , & norman found that the wind luminosity required for this `` blowout '' to occur is larger than @xmath99 .",
    "their numerical simulations suggest that @xmath113 is a sufficient condition for blowout .",
    "large @xmath114 produced blowout when the shell reached a height @xmath115 ; but , for smaller @xmath116 , they suspect the bubble may grow larger in the z - direction before blowing out . for @xmath1173 ,",
    "the ratio of the superbubble s mechanical power to the characteristic luminosity is @xmath118 , and we expect the superbubble to blowout .      the mass of gas that will escape from the galaxy following blowout depends on the depth of the gravitational potential well .",
    "we assume the mass distribution is similar to an isothermal sphere and use the circular velocity , @xmath119 , to estimate the depth of the potential well . for a halo that extends to @xmath120 ,",
    "the escape velocity is given by @xmath121 using bernoulli s theorem , we find the corresponding escape temperature , @xmath122 which describes the specific thermal energy required to establish a smooth , supersonic outflow .",
    "if the velocity gradient along the hi major axis of 18 is produced by a rotating disk , then the deprojected circular velocity is @xmath123 .",
    "the dynamical mass is then @xmath124(viallefond 1987 ) , and halos truncated at 1  kpc and 10  kpc , masses of @xmath125 and @xmath126 respectively , provide representative models . for reference , the escape velocity and escape temperature are tabulated in table  3 as a function of radius .",
    "the predicted temperature for the bubble interior , @xmath127  k ( from eqn .  4 of martin & kennicutt 1995 )",
    ", is considerably higher than the escape temperatures shown in column  4 of table  3 , so the hot bubble interior ( zone 2 ) should easily escape following blowout .",
    "the ensuing question is how much mass resides in this hot phase of interstellar gas . in the canonical superbubble model ,",
    "the hot interior is composed of shocked stellar ejecta and material conductively evaporated off the swept - up shell . from eqn .",
    "9 of shull ( 1993 ) , we estimate that the evaporated mass is @xmath128 , which is more than the @xmath129of enriched gas returned to the ism by the starburst models .",
    "clouds that get run over by the shell and evaporate in the bubble s hot interior may further mass load the bubble ( martin & kennicutt 1995 ) .    unfortunately , the observation provides only a rough upper limit on the mass of hot gas .",
    "if all the flux comes from hot gas of density @xmath130 , the observed luminosity implies a mass of coronal gas @xmath131 for a plasma with cosmic abundance .",
    "( although the value of @xmath130 is unknown , arguments about the gas pressure in the ism suggest it is unlikely to exceed 0.053 . ) at a lower metallicity , the emissivity is expected to be lower , so the inferred mass would be even higher .",
    "this analysis merely demonstrates that thermal emission from hot gas could make a substantial contribution to the luminosity .",
    "although some of the gas in the shell may escape from the galaxy with the hot wind , the starburst will probably not eject the entire ism of 18 .",
    "for example , the escape velocity from the lower mass halo in table  3 is @xmath132near the shell radius .",
    "since the deprojected shell velocity is probably @xmath133 , only fragments of the ruptured shell could coast out of the galaxy .",
    "however , the starburst would have to transfer @xmath134  ergs of kinetic energy to the interstellar gas to accelerate all the hi to 100 , a typical escape velocity in table  3 . in the spherical superbubble model , only 20% of the injected mechanical energy",
    "is converted into the shell s kinetic energy , so the starburst would have to generate at least @xmath135 ergs of mechanical energy to completely eject the ism . in   [ sec : sb ] we estimated values of @xmath96 over an order of magnitude smaller than this , so the complete ejection of the ism is not energetically possible .",
    "our dynamical interpretation of the gas kinematics has two interesting implications for the chemical enrichment of 18 .",
    "first , elements synthesized and ejected by the starburst s massive stars may have been transported @xmath136  pc across the bubble interior in only 15 ",
    "second , most of the oxygen produced may not reside in the warm , ionized gas  a puzzle independently pointed out by others ( kunth & sargent 1986 ) . using a fit to the oxygen yields calculated for 12  100 stars ( prantzos 1994 ) , we derive an oxygen yield @xmath137 for an imf with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1and 100and slope @xmath85 , where @xmath138 is the ratio of the net mass of oxygen produced to the total mass permanently locked up in remnants ( e.g. tinsley 1980 ) .",
    "the starburst models in   [ sec : sb ] formed @xmath139  of 1  100 stars , or about @xmath140  of 0.1  100 stars , so @xmath141 of oxygen are returned to the interstellar gas . if all this oxygen was mixed into the warm , ionized gas , the metallicity of the hii regions would be 5  6 times higher than measured .",
    "the oxygen would have to be mixed throughout the entire mass of hi to produce a homogeneous oxygen abundance as low as 2% @xmath142 .",
    "this unlikely scenario contradicts our hypothesis that the current burst is the first major star formation episode and that the size of the bubble is an indication of the mixing scale .",
    "we suggest that the extra oxygen may still be in the hot phase of the interstellar gas ",
    "zone  2 in  [ fig : cone ] .",
    "assuming a remnant mass of 1.5for the stars in the 12  100 range , we estimate that 10% of the mass turned into stars has been returned to the ism .",
    "the oxygen mass fraction of this gas is then @xmath143 , where the solar value is @xmath144 ( grevesse & noels 1993 ) .",
    "since gas evaporated from the cooler phases of the ism will dilute the hot stellar ejecta (   [ sec : ml2 ] ) , we expect oxygen to comprise @xmath145 of the mass of hot interstellar gas ( i.e. @xmath146 ) .",
    "if the superbubble plays a prominent role in the dispersal of metals over large scales in 18 , significant abundance inhomogeneities might be expected ( cf .",
    "kunth 1994 ) .",
    "we have examined deep longslit , optical spectra of 18 , obtained for a related project ( martin 1996 ) , to search for an abundance edge to the metal - enriched region and to constrain the chemical homogeneity of the ionized gas .",
    "longslit optical spectra of 18 were obtained in 1994 on the mmt using the blue channel spectrograph equipped with a loral 3k @xmath14 1k ccd detector .",
    "a 500 gpm grating blazed at 5410 in 1st order was used with a uv-36 blocking filter and a 1slit .",
    "this configuration provides spectral coverage from approximately 3700to 6800at a moderate spectral resolution , about @xmath147  fwhm .",
    "spectra were obtained at two slit positions , one centered on the nw hii region and rotated to pa 7.6(slit a ) and another positioned across the se hii region at a pa of 131.0(slit b ) ; the total integration times were 12,000 s and 9,900 s , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of the night sky background was recorded on both ends of the slit .",
    "the seeing limited the resolution along the slit to @xmath148 .",
    "care was taken to monitor the effects of varying parallactic angle over the time sequence of frames ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "the data reduction followed standard techniques and employed the iraf software package .",
    "the raw ccd frames were bias subtracted , corrected for pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations and slit illumination , transformed using exposures of an henear arc lamp , and extinction corrected .",
    "a new field flattener was being tested during the november run , and these data required an additional distortion correction .",
    "cosmic rays were removed when the individual frames were combined .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated using observations of standard stars ( massey et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "[ fig : mmt ] demonstrates that the ionized gas across the region where the superbubbles are detected is not primordial .",
    "the [ oiii ] @xmath149 emission extends along slit `` a '' as far ( 23or 1100  pc ) to the sw as the emission line which has comparable intensity .",
    "to the ne the intensity of [ oiii ] falls faster than the intensity but is clearly detected to 21(1030  pc ) .",

    "`` b '' , the emission lines [ oiii ]  @xmath149 and are spatially coincident and detected over 35 .",
    "however , we find no evidence for an abrupt edge to the o - enriched gas within the ionized ism in 18 , as might be expected if the galaxy contains an ultra - low metallicity hi halo ( kunth 1994 ) .",
    "we use the data along slit  `` a '' to place an upper limit on the variation of the o / h abundance ratio within the inner region of the nebula .",
    "the temperature - sensitive line [ oiii ]  @xmath150 is detected over 11(530  pc ) .",
    "this region was divided into four 29 apertures ( a1 to a4 ) , whose positions relative to the nw hii region are shown in  [ fig : oh ] .",
    "table  4 lists the measured line fluxes .",
    "the logarithmic extinction at was derived from the ratio of the and fluxes assuming a stellar balmer absorption equivalent width of 2(e.g .",

    "an external check of the line fluxes for the nw hii region yields excellent agreement with skillman & kennicutt ( 1993 ) , and fluxes from slits `` a '' and `` b '' are consistent at their intersection .    along slit",
    "`` a '' , the line ratio @xmath152 shows evidence for a significant temperature gradient from the sw to the ne side of the nebula , which is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : oh ] .",
    "the photometric errors are dominated by the 2 - 3% uncertainty of our flux calibration for bright lines and by read noise and photon noise in the fainter lines .",
    "these uncertainties were combined in quadrature with the reddening uncertainty to derive the error bars denoted by `` x '' in  [ fig : oh ] .",
    "the error bars denoted by ``  '' include an additional term for the maximum errors introduced by deviations from the parallactic angle .",
    "the o / h abundance ratios shown in figures  [ fig : oh]bc were computed with the iraf interface ( shaw & dufour 1995 ) to the five - level atom program of de robertis , dufour , & hunt ( 1987 ) .",
    "the @xmath153 temperature was calculated from @xmath154 and the parameterization of pagel ( 1992 ) which is based on model calculations by stasinska ( 1990 ) .",
    "the o@xmath155/h abundance was estimated from the heii 4686 flux , and the contribution to the total o / h was found to be much less than the magnitude of our error bars .",
    "our abundance analysis is quite sensitive to @xmath154 .",
    "atmospheric dispersion shifting the auroral line of @xmath156 a few tenths of an arcsecond along the slit relative to the nebular lines could cause a significant error in the temperature measurements . to test for this effect , the frames with @xmath157 and the frames with @xmath158 were separately combined and analyzed .",
    "the results from each set of spectra were similar .",
    "however , we decided to only use the frames taken at the parallactic angle , @xmath157 , for the abundance analysis ; and this selection criterion eliminated most of the frames along slit  b. unfortunately , the small aperture and steep surface brightness profile still make atmospheric dispersion along the slit ( @xmath159 ) a serious concern . for these observations , the atmospheric dispersion between 4000 and 5000 is @xmath160 along the slit ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "the resulting offset along the slit between the profiles of the [ oiii ]  4363and [ oiii ]  5007lines could introduce a systematic error in @xmath152 as large as @xmath161 near the inflection point in the surface brightness profile .",
    "this effect could introduce an artificial gradient in the measured line ratio , but the slope would be in the opposite direction of the trend we measure .",
    "hence , we believe the gradient in @xmath152 is real but adopt the larger error bars to caution the reader about a potential systematic error . we conclude that the o / h abundance ratio in the central 11(530 pc ) is witin 20% that of the nw hii region .",
    "this paper reports new kinematic evidence for expanding , galactic - scale shells of ionized gas in 18 and determines their implications for the galaxy s evolution .",
    "we introduced a dynamical model to quantify the age and power requirements of these superbubbles and an evolutionary synthesis model to associate a stellar population with them .",
    "the mass of metals synthesized by this burst and the metallicity of the hii regions was used to discuss the mass of interstellar gas polluted by the starburst .",
    "the detection of oxygen emission lines from the diffuse gas demonstrates the large spatial extent of the metal - enriched , ionized gas .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn .    1 .",
    "a supergiant shell of ionized gas extends southwestward from the galaxy .",
    "the observed line splitting sets a firm lower limit of 30on the shell s expansion speed",
    ". the shell could be as old as 30  myr .",
    "2 .   on the opposite side of the nw hii region ,",
    "an shell of comparable extent is seen , and the echellogram shows some evidence for a second supergiant shell in this region .",
    "these bubbles may constitute the lobes of a supergiant bubble driven by the starburst and constricted by the morphology of the ambient medium to form a bipolar bubble .",
    "geometrical considerations suggest the shell expands at a speed of @xmath162 .",
    "3 .   the superbubble and starburst may be coeval . a star formation rate of 0.02 ( of 1to 100stars )",
    "yr@xmath1 over the last @xmath3  myr can accelerate the shell and produce the blue luminosity , the ubv colors , and most of the ionizing luminosity of izw18 .",
    "instantaneous burst models fail to produce enough hydrogen ionizing photons .",
    ".   the superbubble will probably blowout of the galaxy , and the hot component of the ism will escape from the galaxy in a galactic wind .",
    "our analysis of the gas dynamics supports the general picture that galactic winds are an important process in the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies ( matteuci & chiosi 1983 ; marconi 1994 ; matteuci & tosi 1985 ) .",
    "the current starburst will probably eject only a small fraction of the galaxy s total gaseous mass .",
    "catastrophic mass loss  proposed to transform gas - rich dwarfs into dwarf elliptical galaxies ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 and references therein )  is unlikely from the current starburst , which may be the first in 18 . whether this is the common outcome of wind driven mass loss from dwarf galaxies is not yet clear ( meurer 1992 ; marlowe 1995 ; heckman 1995 ) .",
    "the detection of the superbubble establishes a timescale ( @xmath163   15 - 27  myr ) and spatial scale ( @xmath163  900  pc ) for dispersing the recently synthesized elements .",
    "oxygen emission lines are detected in the diffuse gas over this spatial scale .",
    "a pilot study of the gas phase metal abundance suggests the sw side of the nebula has a lower @xmath164 and slightly higher oxygen abundance than the ne side .",
    "the emission is slightly harder and brighter than that predicted from the superbubble .",
    "higher resolution observations are needed to determine the fraction of luminosity produced by additional sources .",
