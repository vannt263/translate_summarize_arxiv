    "@xcite was compelling regarding the major role played by the t=1 pairing in n = z nuclei .",
    "these ideas were further developed by bs and broglia and culminated in the review article @xcite , where a very detailed analysis of isovector pairing vibrations was presented .",
    "studies involving isospin effects have undergone a resurgence in recent years as such nuclei become more readily accessible .",
    "moreover , near closed shells , the strength of the pairing force relative to the single - particle level - spacing is expected to be less than the critical value needed to obtain a superconducting solution , and the pairing field then gives rise to a collective phonon .",

    "both features are very common for all isotopes , which suggests the presence of some core excitations in @xmath2ca .    in order to understand the experimental results relativistic rpa ( rrpa ) calculations",
    "have been performed with nl3 @xcite and dd - me2 @xcite interactions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "3 . rrpa predicts low - lying strength with nearly periodic peaked structure caused by the dipole isospin - flip and spin - isospin - flip transitions governed by the pion and effective rho - meson exchange interactions .",
    "the obtained strength , however , shows no enhancement of the strength at lowest energies .",
    "thus , it is expected that correlations beyond rrpa can be responsible for the observed enhancement .",
    "it was realized that the periodic structure observed in the dipole strengths distribution can be associated with the multiparticle - multihole @xmath47 states observed previously in @xmath2ca , and also shown in the left part of fig .",
    "ca(@xmath1he , t)sc reaction at @xmath48 . a folded spectrum ( with fwhm=500 kev )",
    "is shown in red .",
    "the periodic structure of the distribution is clearly visible .",
    "the position of the strong 2@xmath37 transition of the ground state multiplet as well as the results of their coupling to the lowest lying 0@xmath40-states in @xmath2ca are marked .",
    "right part : part of the level scheme of @xmath2ca showing only the 0@xmath40 levels , the level density of the 0@xmath40-states and the shell model prediction for the multiparticle - multihole configurations @xcite.,width=453 ]    coupling the 2@xmath37 state of the ground state multiplet ( which is the strongest channel in the ( @xmath1he , t ) rection ) to the different low - lying 0@xmath40 states in @xmath2ca , the centroids of the bumps at 4,6 and 8 mev can nicely be reproduced .",
    "the density of the states increases rapidly above 8 mev .",
    "the distribution of the 0@xmath40 states is also shown in the right part of the figure .",
    "it has a definite peak at around 10 mev .",
    "coupling this peak to the 2@xmath37 state , one gets the 10 mev peak in the sdr distribution .",
    "such low - lying 0@xmath40 states in @xmath2ca can also be considered as parts of the giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) .",
    "the gmr was investigated by yangblood et al . , @xcite and indeed observed a bump around 10 mev , although the centroid of the gmr was found to be at 19 mev .",
    "we expect also coupling of the 2@xmath37 state to the gmr .",
    "the high energy dipole stench distribution was investigated by gaarde et al .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath2ca(p , n ) reaction at 200 mev bombarding energy and observed such a strong dipole peak at about 22 mev .    according to the shell model calculations of m. sakakura et al.,@xcite the energy of the 4,6 and 8 particle - hole states is also shown in fig .",
    "4 .    such multiparticle - multihole configurations might be associated to monopole multiphonon states as well .",
    "we have a proton - neutron pair connected to such multiphonon states .",
    "the resulting 2@xmath37 states are also coupled to hundreds of other 2@xmath37 states ( we are dealing with an odd - odd nucleus ) , which result in the observed spreading of their strengths .",
    "similar periodic structure is expected in the dipole strengths distribution of @xmath2k excited in the @xmath2ca(n , p ) reaction . for the n = z @xmath2ca nucleus the sum rule for the @xmath49 and @xmath50 strengths reduces to @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "so the cross section of the @xmath2ca(p , n ) and the @xmath2ca(n , p ) reactions should be the same .",
    "for isospin symmetry considerations one expects the same strengths distribution as well for the ( p , n ) and ( n , p ) type reactions .    unfortunately , most of the ( n , p ) reactions were performed at low bombarding energy where the spin - isospin exciations were suppressed . the only reaction , which was studied at intermediate energy ( 152 mev ) was performed by maesday et al . ,",
    "@xcite , but the energy resolution was about 3 mev , which smeared out the structure of the spin dipole strengths distribution .",
    "they observed only one broad peak , which was identified as the gdr .    *",
