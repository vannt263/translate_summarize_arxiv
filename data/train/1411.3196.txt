    "it is always a hard task for the theoretical physicists to come up with a method that can depict the atomic and molecular spectroscopic properties very precisely .",
    "the effects of electron correlations as well as the relativistic effects have to be taken care simultaneously as they are intertwined @xcite . the dirac - hartree - fock method in its four - component formalism",
    "is the best possible way to include the effects of the relativity within a single determinantal description . on the other hand ,",
    "coupled - cluster theory is known to be the most elegant to effectuate the electron correlation @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , the combination of these two methods will surely be the solution to the problem .",
    "the first step put forward in this direction is by kaldor and coworkers .",
    "they implemented relativistic counterpart of the fock - space multi - reference coupled cluster theory ( fsmrcc ) for the cause and applied extensively to both atomic and molecular systems @xcite .",
    "the original idea of fsmrcc theory is based on the construction of an effective hamiltonian using bloch - lindgren equation to extricate some of the roots of the hamiltonian matrix from the set of entire eigen spectrum @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian variant of fsmrcc theory works within a reduced dimensional space , called model space , is the part of the correlation space chosen to construct the effective hamiltonian and rest of the space is known as orthogonal space . the linear combination of suitably chosen active configurations based on energetic criteria is used to construct the model space .",
    "an operator , called wave operator is defined through which the contribution of orthogonal space included , is the tool to construct the effective hamiltonian .",
    "finally , the diagonalization of the effective hamiltonian matrix includes the correlation contribution of the model space and results into the set of desired eigenvalues .",
    "the problem associated with a reduced dimension effective hamiltonian is the problem of intruder state , which leads to the failure in convergence .",
    "it appears that the effective hamiltonian formalism of the fsmrcc theory is not straight forward , conceptually difficult and lot of complicacy is associated with it .",
    "an alternative elegant approach to tackle the problem is to use of the equation - of - motion variant of the coupled cluster theory ( eomcc ) @xcite .",
    "the eomcc is operationally a two step process : ( i ) solution of the coupled cluster equation for the n electron determinant and ( ii ) construction and diagonalization of the effective hamiltonian matrix in the ( n-1 ) electron determinantal space to get the desired set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues .",
    "as eomcc simultaneously treats two hilbert space ( n and n-1 electron space ) in a single problem , the effect of relaxation is also taken care which plays a key role in the accurate description of the electronic states .",
    "the dynamic part of the electron correlation is taken care by the exponential structure of the cc operator whereas non - dynamical part comes through the diagonalization of the effective hamiltonian in the configuration space .",
    "we must admit that the eomcc for the single ionization problem is equivalent to the ( 0,1 ) sector fsmrcc theory and produces identical results for the principal peaks @xcite .",
    "the superiority of the eomcc method over fsmrcc theory is that the numerical instability due to the problem of intruder states in fsmrcc does not arise in eomcc as it is an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the eomcc is capable of giving shake - up states , which play important role in explaining various photo - ionization spectra @xcite",
    ".    the eomcc can be viewed as a multi - state approach where multiple states are obtained in a single calculation and are treated on equal footing .",
    "it works within a single reference description to describe the complex multi - configurational wave function .",
    "it is pertinent to say that eomcc behaves properly at the non - interacting limit but not rigorously size extensive @xcite .",
    "the error due to the size extensivity is reduced due to the presence of higher order block .",
    "furthermore , the eigenstates in eomcc method are obtained directly contrary to the propagator approaches though both the methods are of eom structure @xcite .",
    "recently , we stepped into the domain of fully 4- component relativistic eomcc and employed to calculate single ionization and double ionization potentials but that was for the atomic systems in their closed - shell configuration @xcite .",
    "the molecular relativistic calculations are always more tedious than the atomic ones .",
    "the spherical symmetry can be exploited in the atomic case , which allows the separation of the radial and angular part to use of the reduced matrix elements .",
    "the evaluation of radial integrals can be done using the numerical integration .",
    "it reduces the computational scaling . however , the method is less straight forward as each of the radial integral has to be multiplied by the corresponding angular factor .",
    "the use of anti - symmetrized quantities ( two - body matrix elements ) are common in molecular calculations , which is not suitable for the spherical implementation in the atomic case as different angular factor will arise for the direct and exchange part of the radial integrals .",
    "the complexity associated with the atomic calculations is more than compensated by the need to solve only for the radial equations .",
    "this allows the use of very large basis set and to correlate more number of electrons with numerically evaluated radial integrals to achieve better accuracy of results .",
    "the relativistic effective core potential ( recp ) is routinely used in molecular relativistic calculations @xcite . in recp , only valence and some of the outer - core electrons are treated explicitly and rest of the electrons are replaced by an effective recp operator .",
    "this includes the simulating interaction of explicitly treated electrons with those , which are excluded from the recp calculation .",
    "there are variety of recps depending on how the recps are optimized @xcite . among the various recps ,",
    "the recp with spin - orbit ( so ) interaction is the most popular one .",
    "this is generally done on the basis of separation of the electrons into core and valence and between the scalar and spin - orbit relativistic effects according to the energy .",
    "it allows exclusion of a large number of chemically inert electrons from the scf calculations , which eventually reduces the computational costs for the correlation calculation as compared to the all electron 2-component and 4-component calculation .",
    "the problem associated with this approach is the lack of control over accuracy .",
    "hirata was first to implement relativistic eomcc for the purpose of molecular calculations @xcite .",
    "he combined different electron correlation methods , basis set , and relativistic treatment to make a composite method .",
    "the dynamic part of the electron correlation is taken care with a low rank method including the scalar relativistic effect and employed various basis sets to enable complete basis set extrapolation .",
    "the non dynamical correlation is treated using eomcc method with small basis set .",
    "finally , the so effect is added as the energy difference between the recp+so with recp calculated using a low rank correlated method .",
    "this approach cancels some of the errors associated with the recp methods .",
    "we would rather call hirata s treatment as a good compromise of the different many - body effects to get reasonable results . this approach does not address the complex interplay between the relativistic and correlation effects , which has been taken into account using 4-component single particle wave function and the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian along with the correlation treatment is done by the eom - ccsd method .    in this article",
    ", we consider the implementation of fully 4-component relativistic eomcc method to calculate ionization potentials of molecular systems within the single- and double- excitation approximation ( eom - ccsd method ) .",
    "pilot calculations of molecular ionization potential using eom - ccsd method are presented .",
    "we have also presented results by constructing the ground state wave function at the first order perturbation theory level , which corresponds to the second order perturbation energy as the ground state energy .",
    "we call this as eom - mbpt(2 ) .",
    "these results are compared with the eom - ccsd results to understand the role of electron correlation . to justify the fact that the relativistic and electron correlation effects are non - additive ,",
