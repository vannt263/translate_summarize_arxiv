    "the study of collective behavior  whether of animals , mechanical systems , or simply abstract oscillators  has fascinated a large number of researchers from observational zoologists to pure mathematicians @xcite . in animals , for example , the study of phenomena such as flocking and herding now involves close collaboration between biologists , mathematicians , physicists , computer scientists , and others @xcite .",
    "this has led to a large number of fundamental insights  for example , bacterial colonies exhibit cooperative growth patterns @xcite , schools of fish can make collective decisions @xcite , army ants coordinate in the construction of bridges @xcite , intrinsic stochasticity can facilitate coherence in insect swarms @xcite , human beings coordinate in consensus decision making @xcite , and more .",
    "it has also led to interesting applications , including stabilization strategies for collective motion @xcite and multi - vehicle flocking @xcite .",
    "grazing animals such as antelope , cattle , and sheep derive protection from predators by living in herds @xcite . by synchronizing their behavior ( i.e. , by tending to eat and lie down at the same time ) , it is easier for the animals to remain together as a herd @xcite .",
    "when out at pasture , cattle are strongly synchronized in their behavior @xcite , but when housed indoors during the winter , increased competition for limited resources can lead to increased aggression @xcite , interrupted feeding or lying @xcite , and a breakdown of synchrony @xcite . there is a growing body of evidence that such disruptions to synchrony ( in particular , disruptions to lying down ) can have significant effects on cattle production ( i.e. , growth rate ) and cattle welfare @xcite .",
    "indeed , synchrony has been proposed as a useful measure of positive welfare in cattle @xcite , and the european union regulations stipulate that cattle housed in groups should be given sufficient space so that they can all lie down simultaneously ( council directive 97/2/ec ) . in the winter , cattle have to be housed indoors ; space for both lying and feeding is thus limited , and welfare problems can potentially arise because such circumstances interfere with the inherent individual oscillations of cows .",
    "although cattle synchronize their behavior if space and resources allow , the mechanism by which they do this is not fully understood @xcite . in this paper , we examine interacting cattle using a mathematical setting to try to gain an understanding of possible mechanisms .",
    "viable approaches to studying interacting cows include agent - based models as well as further abstraction via the development and analysis of appropriate dynamical systems to model the cattle behavior . in a recent dissertation @xcite ,",
    "b. franz modified the animal behavior model of ref .",
    "@xcite to develop an agent - based model of beef cattle and conduct a preliminary investigation of its synchronization properties .",
    "given the extreme difficulty of actually understanding the mechanisms that produce the observed dynamics in such models , we have decided instead to take a more abstract approach using dynamical systems .",
    "cattle are ruminants , so it is biologically plausible to view them as oscillators .",
    "they ingest plant food , swallow it and then regurgitate it at some later stage , and then chew it again . during the first stage ( standing / feeding ) , they stand up to graze , but they strongly prefer to lie down and ` ruminate ' or chew the cud for the second stage ( lying / ruminating ) .",
    "they thus oscillate between two stages .",
    "both stages are necessary for complete digestion , although the duration of each stage depends on factors such as the nutrient content of the food and the metabolic state of the animal @xcite .",
    "we thus suppose that each cow is an oscillator , and we choose each oscillator to be a piecewise affine dynamical system in order to incorporate the requisite state - switching behavior in the simplest possible fashion . even with this simple model , each individual cow exhibits very interesting dynamics , which is unsurprising given the known complexities of modeling piecewise smooth dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "piecewise smooth systems have been employed successfully in numerous applications  especially in engineering but occasionally also in other subjects , including biology @xcite . to our knowledge , however , this paper presents the first application of piecewise smooth dynamical systems to animal behavior .",
    "our contributions in this paper include the development of a piecewise affine dynamical system model of a cow s eating , lying down , and standing cycles ; an in - depth analysis of the mathematical properties of this model ; investigation of synchronization in models ( which we call _ herd models _ ) produced by coupling multiple copies of the single cow model in a biologically - motivated manner ; and a discussion of the biological consequences of our results .",
    "although our approach is abstract , the present paper is not merely an investigation of equations with interesting dynamics , as we have also developed interesting biological predictions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ two ] , we discuss the dynamical system that we use to describe the behavior of a single cow .",
    "we present , in turn , the equations of motion , conditions that describe switching between different states ( eating , lying down , and standing ) , and a discrete representation using a poincar section . in section [ three ] , we analyze this _ single cow model _ by studying its equilibrium point , periodic orbits , and bifurcations .",
    "we examine interacting cows in section [ four ] .",
    "we present the coupling scheme that we use to construct our _ herd equations _ , introduce the measure of synchrony that we employ , and examine herd synchrony numerically first for a pair of cows and then for larger networks of cows . in section [ five ] , we comment on our results and briefly discuss variant herd models that can be constructed with different types of coupling .",
    "we then conclude in section [ six ] and provide details of our poincar section and map constructions and analysis in appendix [ app1 ] .",
    "we construct a caricature of each cow by separately considering the observable _ state _ of the cow ( eating , lying down , or standing ) and its unobservable level of hunger or desire to lie down , which can each vary between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we also need a mechanism to switch between different states when the level of hunger or desire to lie down exceeds some threshold .",
    "we therefore model each individual cow as a piecewise smooth dynamical system @xcite .",
    "we model the biological status of a single cow by @xmath2 \\times [ 0,1 ] \\times \\theta\\,.\\ ] ] the real variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent , respectively , the extent of desire to eat and lie down of the cow , and @xmath5 is a discrete variable that represents the current state of the cow ( see the equations below for descriptions of the states ) . throughout this paper , we will refer to @xmath6 as a _",
    "symbolic variable _ or a _",
    "state variable_. one can think of the symbolic variable @xmath6 as a switch that triggers different time evolution rules for the other two variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we model the dynamics of a single cow in different states using @xmath7 where the calligraphic letters inside parentheses indicate the corresponding values of @xmath6 . for biological reasons , the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 must all be positive real numbers .",
    "they can be interpreted as follows : @xmath12    the monotocity in each state ( growth versus decay ) is the salient feature of the dynamics , and we choose a linear dependence in each case to facilitate analytical treatment .",
    "the piecewise smooth dynamical system describing an individual cow is thus a _ piecewise affine dynamical system _ @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in the following sections , this simple model is already mathematically interesting . and @xmath4 in all of the states can be treated similarly using the method we describe in section 2.3 through an appropriate poincar section .",
    "it is expected to produce qualitatively similar results , as the detailed flow between state transitions is irrelevant once the intersections with poincar section have been determined . ]    additionally , note that we could have added an additional positive parameter @xmath13 to each equation to prevent the degeneracy of the @xmath14 equilibrium point that occurs for all three equations . and @xmath4 to a region that excludes the point @xmath15 .",
    "we opt for the latter choice ( see the next subsection for details ) . ]",
    "the dynamics within each state do not fully specify the equations governing a single cow . to close the bovine equations",
    ", we also need switching conditions that determine how the state variable @xmath6 changes .",
    "we illustrate these switching conditions in fig .",
    "[ fig : stateswitch ] and describe them in terms of equations as follows : @xmath16 the positive number @xmath17 allows the point @xmath18 to be excluded from the domain , so that the degenerate equilibrium at that point becomes a so - called _ virtual equilibrium point _",
    "( i.e. , an equilibrium point that is never actually reached by the system ) @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ eq : singlecowe ] , [ eq : singlecowr ] , [ eq : singlecows ] , [ eq : singlecowswitch ] ) form a complete set of equations describing our _ single cow model_. this bovine model is a piecewise smooth dynamical system , to which some important elements of the traditional theory for smooth dynamical systems do not apply , as discussed in depth in the recent book @xcite .    \\times[\\delta,1]\\times\\theta$ ] on @xmath19 , where edges of the square correspond to the borders at which switching occurs . in the right panel , we show the detailed switching situations ; an arrow from one edge to another indicates the change of @xmath6 at that edge from one state to the other .",
    "( the arrows with solid curves are the ones that leave state @xmath20 , those with dashed curves are the ones that leave state @xmath21 , and those with dotted curves are the ones that leave state @xmath22 . ) ]      although it is straightforward to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : singlecowe ] , [ eq : singlecowr ] , [ eq : singlecows ] ) for the fixed state @xmath6 , it is cumbersome to use such a formula to obtain analytical expressions when the flow involves discontinuous changes in @xmath6 ( as specified by the switching conditions ) .",
    "therefore , we instead study the dynamics on the boundaries as discrete maps rather than the flow on the whole domain .",
    "we accomplish this by appropriately defining a poincar section @xcite as the surface @xmath23 which is transverse to the flow of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : singlecowe ] , [ eq : singlecowr ] , [ eq : singlecows ] ) as long as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "( see the appendix for the proof . ) furthermore , any flow for which all four of these parameters are positive intersects @xmath26 recurrently ( again see the appendix ) .    although @xmath26 itself is sufficient to construct a poincar map ( we will use @xmath27 to represent this map on @xmath26 ) , it is convenient to consider the discrete dynamics on an extended poincar section @xmath28 , which we define by adding the other two boundaries of the projected square to @xmath26 to obtain @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are used to represent the sets @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we illustrate the extended poincar section in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : stateswitch ] .",
    "the poincar map on @xmath28 is given by the discrete dynamics @xmath34 derived by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : singlecowe ] , [ eq : singlecowr ] , [ eq : singlecows ] ) with respect to appropriate initial conditions .",
    "as we show in the appendix , this map is given explicitly by @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowdemo ] , we show all possible mappings on @xmath28 and , in particular , illuminate all of the possible cases in ( [ casemap ] ) .",
    "the poincar map @xmath36 can be obtained from @xmath37 ( see the discussion in the appendix ) .     that are derived from the original system .",
    "for example , from @xmath38 , the flow is going to either hit the horizontal @xmath39 , which triggers the state @xmath40 [ case @xmath41 , or hit the vertical @xmath42 , resulting in the transition @xmath43 [ case @xmath44 .",
    "the other three panels similarly demonstrate the other switching possibilities for the variable @xmath6 . ]",
    "in this section , we summarize a few properties of the single cow model in terms of the discrete dynamics @xmath27 on @xmath26 .",
    "specifically , we give analytical results for the emergence and stability of the fixed point ( which is unique ) and the period - two orbits on @xmath26 .",
    "we include detailed derivations of these results in the appendix .",
    "we summarize these results in table  [ tablesummary ] .    for convenience , we assume that the cow is initially in the state @xmath21 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if the cow were to start in other situations , it would eventually come to this state .",
    "furthermore , we have chosen to assign the state value @xmath47 to the point @xmath48 for as a tie - breaker .",
    "similarly , @xmath38 at @xmath49 and @xmath50 at @xmath51 , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlecowswitch ] ) .",
    "the only possible fixed point on @xmath26 is the corner point @xmath52 .",
    "this fixed point is asymptotically stable if and only if the parameters satisfy @xmath53 additionally , ( when the above condition holds ) numerical simulations indicate that the basin of attraction of this fixed point seems to be the entire domain .",
    "the next simplest type of orbits for the discrete map have period two and correspond to cycles of the flow .",
    "a period - two orbit on @xmath26 must contain points for which @xmath38 and @xmath50 appear alternatively .",
    "this can occur in a few different situations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : periodtwo ] ) , which we summarize in the following subsections .",
    "we include further details in the appendix .",
    "note that some of the period - two orbits correspond to higher - period orbits of the discrete dynamics on @xmath28 . for convenience ,",
    "we represent such orbits on @xmath28 , with the understanding that when restricted to @xmath26 ( i.e. , when points with symbolic variable @xmath22 are excluded ) , they all have period two .    . ]",
    "the existence of such an orbit requires the parameters to satisfy @xmath55 this implies that there are infinitely many stable but not asymptotically stable period - two orbits .",
    "the initial value of @xmath3 is @xmath56 and the initial value of @xmath4 ( called @xmath57 , of course ) is in the range @xmath58",
    "if @xmath57 is outside of this range , then one can see using numerical simulations that this orbit will necessarily contain a point in this range that a stable period - two orbit .",
    "the parameters need to satisfy @xmath60 or else any trajectory either converges to a fixed point or a stable period - two orbit ( as discussed above ) .",
    "it is also necessary that @xmath61 there is only one period - two orbit of this type if the above two conditions hold .",
    "this implies that @xmath56 and @xmath62 this periodic orbit is asymptotically stable if and only if @xmath63 that is , the orbit is asymptotically stable if and only if the rate at which a cow becomes sated while it eating is slower than the rate at which it becomes hungrier when it is not eating .",
    "again , we first need @xmath65 additionally , @xmath66 there is also only one period - two orbit of this type ; it has @xmath56 and @xmath67 this orbit is asymptotically stable if and only if @xmath68 this case is analogous to case b , except that the roles of lying down and eating have been reversed .",
    "hence , this period - two orbit is asymptotically stable if and only if the rate at which a cow desires to get up when it is lying down is slower than the rate at which it increases its desire to lie down when it is not lying down .",
    "the appearance of this orbit requires the following conditions to be satisfied : @xmath70 there are infinitely many such orbits , which satisfy @xmath56 and @xmath71 all of these orbits are stable but not asymptotically stable .",
    "we summarize the emergence of low - period orbits ( up to period two ) of @xmath72 in different parameter ranges in table  [ tablesummary ] .",
    ".summary of low - period orbits ( up to period two ) and",
    "their stability of the single cow dynamics restricted to the poincar section @xmath26 .",

    "although one could proceed to analyze more complicated orbits , this is not the main topic of this paper .",
    "instead , we simply illustrate the existence of more complicated ( possibly chaotic ) orbits through a bifurcation diagram ( see fig .",

    "we join successive points on @xmath26 with straight lines , and we note that the actual flow that connects these points are piecewise convex curves . ]",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , there are many biological benefits to achieving synchronized eating and lying down in cattle .",
    "we are thus motivated to construct _",
    "herd equations _ that describe interacting cows by coupling the single cow equations ( [ eq : singlecowe][eq : singlecowswitch ] ) .",
    "we make specific choices motivated by biology and simplicity , though it is of course important to consider both more complicated choices and alternative forms of coupling .",
    "our goal is to highlight just one possible form of the interactions in detail , but we hope that our work will serve as a springboard for rumination of some of the alternatives that we will mention briefly in section [ five ] .    in this section ,",
    "we numerically investigate the effect of coupling in a system of a few cows .",
    "for the purpose of simplifying the exposition of the equations , we use indicator functions defined on the set @xmath86 : @xmath87    the single cow equation in between state transitions ( [ eq : singlecow ] ) can then be written as @xmath88 where we have defined functions @xmath89      there are numerous possible ways to model the coupling between cows .",
    "we have chosen one based on the hypothesis that a cow feels hungrier when it notices the other cows eating and feels a greater desire to lie down when it notices other cows lying down .",
    "( we briefly discuss other possibilities in section [ five ] . )",
    "this provides a coupling that does not have a spatial component , in contrast to the agent - based approach of ref .",
    "we therefore assume implicitly that space is unlimited , so we are considering cows to be in a field rather than in a pen .",
    "we suppose that the herd consists of @xmath90 cows and use @xmath91 to represent the @xmath91-th cow in the herd .",
    "this yields herd equations given by @xmath92x_i\\,,\\\\          \\dot{y_i}=\\big[\\beta^{(i)}(s_i ) + \\frac{\\sigma_{y}}{k_i}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}\\chi_{\\mathcal{r}}(s_j)\\big]y_i\\ , ,      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] with switching condition according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlecowswitch ] ) for each individual cow .",
    "the second terms in both equations give the coupling terms of this system .",

    "its components are given by @xmath94 additionally , @xmath95 is the degree of node @xmath91 ( i.e. , the number of cows to which it is connected ) , and the coupling strengths @xmath96 and @xmath97 are non - negative ( and usually positive ) real numbers corresponding to the strength of coupling .",
    "this is designed to emphasize that animal interaction strengths consider proximity to neighboring animals .",
    "it is important to note that in the case where @xmath98 is time - independent , the dynamics governing the network of interacting cows only changes when at least one of the individual cows changes its state @xmath99 . in practice",
    ", we can solve analytically for the flows in between such transitions ( because they are piecewise affine differential equations ) instead of performing numerical integration in the whole time interval , which might cause numerical instability when the number of transitions becomes large .",
    "we also need a measure for the synchrony between cows . for each cow",

    "interestingly , when the coupling strength is increased , the cows tend to synchronize less when they are coupled via a circular lattice , whereas synchrony is improved if they are coupled via a star graph .",
    "we have also tested numerically other network configurations , such as circular lattices with more than just nearest - neighbor connections and ( erds - reny ) random graphs , and the resulting curves are qualitatively similar to the one shown in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : tencowssync ] . it would be interesting to study what network architectures can lead to good synchrony beyond the star graph , which is an idealized example .",
    "a heuristic reason that synchrony can decrease when coupling is increased in our herd model ( and , more generally , in piecewise smooth dynamical systems ) is that decreasing the difference in the observable variables @xmath78 through coupling does not necessarily reduce the difference in the hidden state variable @xmath6 , and the effect of coupling might well be the opposite from what one would naively anticipate , as we have observed using the circular lattice structure .",
    "moreover , recent work in other contexts has illustrated that increasing the number of connections in a network can sometimes lead to less synchrony @xcite .",
    "although synchronization has been studied extensively for smooth dynamical systems  @xcite and the mechanisms that promote synchrony in such situations are relatively well understood , little is known about networks of coupled piecewise smooth dynamical systems .",
    "it would be interesting to study the influence of network architecture on synchrony for models other than smooth dynamical systems ( such as the herd model considered in this paper ) , which might prove to be important in studying the behavior of interacting animals .",
    "we have only scratched the surface concerning the modeling of herd synchrony in cattle .",
    "we considered each cow as an oscillator , which we modeled as a piecewise affine dynamical system .",
    "our single cow model had interesting mathematical properties , which we discussed in detail .",
    "monotonic dynamics within each state was the most important detail , and we chose affine monotonic dynamics to make the analysis as tractable as possible .",
    "we illustrated herd dynamics through specific coupling choices between cows .",
    "we assumed that the herd is in a field rather than a pen and , in particular , ignored the presence of spatial constraints .",
    "we considered cows that become hungrier when they notice others eating and a greater desire to lie down when they notice others lying down , but numerous other choices would also be interesting to study .",
    "for example , the relative importances of the two aforementioned types of positive coupling can be varied systematically , and the specific functional forms of coupling can also , of course , be different . additionally , it is not clear whether cow synchrony arises from such an active mechanism or whether it can arise from more passive forms of coupling .",
    "in particular , this could entail the incorporation of spatial effects , such as limited eating and bedding areas and the competition of cows for such resources .",
    "the inherent oscillations of individual cows can lead to synchronization even with almost no interactions between individuals @xcite .",
    "synchrony can potentially emerge even if the only interaction between cows occurs when one steps on another one , so such a minimalist but biologically meaningful mechanism ( in which the cows need not even notice whether another cow is feeding or resting ) would be interesting to test against more complicated forms of interaction .",
    "it would also be interesting to use real observations of cattle to compare the synchronization properties in limited space versus  unlimited \" space ( i.e. , pens versus open fields ) , and such experiments are currently in progress .",
    "one could examine spatial effects in the oscillator model of cows by considering more realistic network architectures .",
    "such networks could either come from experimental data ( which has not yet been gathered ) of which cows come into contact with each other or using structures that respect the fact that fields and pens are planar regions .",
    "it would also be interesting to consider different network structures from an abstract perspective in order to test observations such as the different dynamics with the star graph ( which has one high - degree node and many small - degree nodes ) , and also to consider the synchronization dynamics of larger herds .",
    "additionally , herds of cattle are known to have hierarchies , as not all cows are created equal , and this can be incorporated into the model either through an appropriate network architecture or by considering heterogeneity in the dynamics of individual cows .",
    "an alternative modeling choice would be to consider agent - based models for the herd @xcite rather than the oscillator model that we have studied .",
    "agent - based formulations are good at incorporating spatial effects , but they of course have a black - box flavor that makes them very difficult to analyze .    the inherent oscillation between the standing / eating phase and the lying / ruminating phase has interesting biological consequences . for example , to stay together as a herd , it is not necessary for all cows to be exactly synchronized , as is sometimes believed .",
    "it is possible ( and it has been observed often in fields ) for a herd to have some individuals lying down and other individuals standing and grazing around them . from a functional perspective , it is conceivable that this could lead to better spotting of predators than if everyone had their heads down at the same time .",
    "a degree of desychronization ( provided that it did nt lead to the herd breaking up ) might actually be better for each individual than perfect synchronization @xcite .",
    "intriguingly the recent model of groups of animals by dostlkov and pinka , in which each individual can either move or stay in one place , has found evidence ( using optimization of a cost function ) of partial synchronization but that completely synchronized and completely desynchronized situations seem to occur for a much larger set of parameter values @xcite . moreover , their  paradoxical \" prediction that average group size might decrease as the ratio of the grouping benefit to grouping cost increases is in some sense similar ( at least philosophically ) to our prediction that less synchronization can potentially occur even with stronger coupling between individual cows .",
    "although we have framed our discussion in terms of cows , our oscillator framework is very general and should also be useful  perhaps with modifications that are tailored to different species  in studying the behavior of other ruminants .",
    "it is of considerable biological interest to establish empirically which mechanisms for synchrony actually operate in real cows ( and , more generally , in other ruminants and in other animals ) and to discern more precisely the extent to which such synchrony actually occurs .",
    "it is thus important to develop testable predictions that can help one distinguish the numerous possible synchronization mechanisms .",
    "we have taken one small step in this paper , but there is clearly a lot more interesting research on the horizon .",
    "it is also desirable to consider practical situations , such as the effect of changing pen shape , stocking density , size of lying area , feed - trough size and position , and the nutrient quality of the food .",
    "in addition to the many fascinating animal - behavior questions , the research reported in this paper also suggests several interesting abstract questions .",
    "for example , although the theory of synchronization is well - developed and widely used for smooth dynamical systems  @xcite , it is an open problem to predict in general when a system that is composed of coupled piecewise smooth oscillators can achieve a stable synchronous state . in pursuing such considerations",
    ", it would also be relevant to consider different notions of synchrony .",
    "such analysis is of potential importance given the wealth of piecewise smooth dynamical systems that arise in many applications  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effects of delay and changes in the network architecture in time are also expected to affect the synchronization properties , though such considerations are difficult even for smooth systems  @xcite .",
    "we hope that that the model that we have developed in this paper will stimulate research along these lines .",
    "we modeled the eating , lying , and standing dynamics of a cow using a piecewise affine dynamical system .",
    "we constructed poincar maps to examine the system s equilibrium point and low - period cycles in depth and illustrated more complicated behavior using bifurcation diagrams .",
    "we then considered a model of coupled cows  first using two cows and then using networks of interacting cows  in order to study herd synchrony .",
    "we chose a form of coupling based on cows having an increased desire to eat if they notice another cow eating and an increased desire to lie down if they notice another cow lying down .",
    "we constructed a measure of synchrony that keeps track of when each cow is in a given state and showed that it is possible for cows to synchronize _ less _ when the coupling is increased .",
    "we also discussed other forms of coupling and cow - interaction networks that can be studied using our formulation .",
    "this line of inquiry seems very promising and that it will not only lead to interesting future theoretical investigations but can even motivate new experiments .",
    "although we framed our discussion in terms of cows , our framework is general and it should be fruitful in the study of the behavior of other ruminants as well .",
    "the stakes are high when studying animal behavior , and we believe that our model of cattle herds ( and generalizations of our model ) will yield increased understanding of their synchronization properties .",
    "milking these ideas as much as possible should prove to be very insightful from both theoretical and practical perspectives .",
