    "from the observation of neutrino oscillations , we now know that lepton flavors are not conserved",
    ". however , the mixing and small neutrino mass differences seen in oscillations have a negligible effect on charged - lepton flavor violating ( clfv ) reactions .",
    "thus , the clfv reactions provide a discovery window for interactions beyond standard model expectations @xcite .",
    "muons play a central role in searches for clfv @xcite , because they can be produced in large numbers and live relatively long .",
    "one reaction that can be probed with particularly high sensitivity is coherent muon - electron conversion in a muonic atom , @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents a nucleus of atomic number @xmath3 and mass number @xmath4 .",
    "it has the advantage of producing just a single particle , a mono - energetic electron .",
    "it does not have the problem of accidental background that plagues searches for the decay @xmath5 , which can be mimicked by a positron from a normal muon decay and a photon coming from the radiative decay of a different muon , bremsstrahlung , or positron annihilation - in - flight .",
    "various experiments have been performed over the years to search for the conversion @xcite .",
    "the most stringent results come from the sindrum ii collaboration @xcite , which reports an upper limit of @xmath6 for the branching ratio of the conversion process relative to muon capture in gold .",
    "several new efforts are being planned . in the nearest future",
    ", the deeme collaboration @xcite has proposed to reach @xmath7 sensitivity .",
    "larger scale searches , mu2e at fermilab @xcite and comet at j - parc @xcite , aim for sensitivities below @xmath8 . in the long run ,",
    "intensity upgrades at fermilab and the proposal prism / prime at j - parc may allow them to reach @xmath9 sensitivity .",
    "a quite remarkable improvement of about four orders of magnitude , with respect to the current limit , is therefore envisaged .",
    "the success of the conversion searches depends critically on control of the background events .",
    "the signal for the @xmath0 conversion process in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mueconv ] ) is a mono - energetic electron with energy @xmath10 , given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the muon mass , @xmath13 is the binding energy of the muonic atom , and @xmath14 is the nuclear - recoil energy , with @xmath15 the fine - structure constant and @xmath16 the nucleus mass .",
    "the main physics background for this signal comes from the so - called muon decay in orbit ( dio ) , a process in which the muon decays in the normal way , @xmath17 , while in the orbit of the atom . whereas in a free muon decay",
    ", in order to conserve energy and three - momentum , the maximum electron energy is @xmath18 , for dio , the nucleus recoil can balance the electron s three - momentum taking basically no energy .",
    "this allows for the maximum electron energy to be @xmath10 , close to the full muon mass @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the high - energy electrons from the muon decay in orbit constitute a background for conversion searches .",
    "several theoretical studies of the muon decay in orbit have been published .",
    "expressions describing the electron spectrum including relativistic effects in the muon wavefunction , the coulomb interaction between the electron and the nucleus and a finite nuclear size have been available for some time @xcite .",
    "however , the high - energy endpoint of the spectrum , which is the most important region for conversion - search experiments , was not studied in detail .",
    "references @xcite did study the high - energy end of the electron spectrum , and presented approximate results which allow for a quick rough estimate of the muon decay in orbit contribution to the background in conversion experiments .",
    "we have performed a new evaluation of the dio spectrum , considering in detail all the effects needed in the high - energy region @xcite .",
    "our results describe the background contribution for @xmath0 conversion searches , as well as a check on previous low- and high - energy partial calculations @xcite and an interpolation between them .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that not only the high - energy region is relevant for conversion experiments , but the full spectrum is necessary in order to study reconstruction errors in the detector .    to obtain the correct result for the high - energy tail of the spectrum",
    "it is crucial to include nuclear - recoil effects , since they modify the endpoint energy ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : conven ] ) ) . also , to produce an on - shell electron with energy around @xmath12 , either the muon must be at the tail of the bound - state wavefunction or the produced electron must interact with the nucleus .",
    "this tells us that the full dirac equation for the muon as well as the interaction of the outgoing electron with the field of the nucleus must be taken into account .",
    "also , finite - nuclear - size effects will be most important in this region .",
    "order @xmath15 radiative corrections are not expected to significantly modify the results at the endpoint , and are not included in our results .",
    "uncertainties in the modelling of finite nuclear - size effects induce errors in the spectrum that increase as we approach the endpoint , but those errors are never larger than a few percent .",
    "here we present our results for the elements that are relevant for the upcoming conversion experiments .",
    "the deeme collaboration plans to use a silicon - carbide target , whereas the mu2e and comet collaborations are considering aluminum and titanium as targets . in table",
    "[ tab : en ] we give the values of the bound muon energy @xmath20 and the electron endpoint energy @xmath10 , for carbon , aluminum , silicon and titanium .",

    "those results are useful for assessing the dio background events from carbon for the deeme experiment which will search primarily for conversion in silicon .",
    "they also illustrate the electron resolution requirements , as a function of stopping target , needed to reach future high sensitivity goals .",
    "the high sensitivity that the upcoming conversion experiments will reach may also allow them to improve the present bounds on some exotic muon decays , like the decay of the muon into an electron and a majoron ( a goldstone boson that appears in models where lepton number is a spontaneously broken global symmetry ) @xcite .",
