    "kinematic studies of early - type galaxies have revealed a remarkable variety of interesting behavior ; some galaxies have rotation axes `` misaligned '' with respect to their minor axes ( franx , illingworth , & de zeeuw 1991 ) , while in others the inner regions counterrotate with respect to the rest of the galaxy ( statler , smecker - hane , & cecil 1996 ; bender & surma 1992 ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "such intriguing kinematics could plausibly result if these galaxies are the end - products of disk - galaxy mergers ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) , and n - body simulations have gone some ways toward showing that mergers can indeed produce remnants with distinctive kinematics ( hernquist & barnes 1991 ; barnes 1992 , 1998 ; balcells & gonzlez 1998 ) .",
    "however , other theories have been put forward for such kinematic features , particularly in the case of counterrotation ( kormendy 1984 ; bertola , buson , & zeilinger 1988 ) .",
    "distinguishing between major mergers and other explanations for distinctive kinematics in galaxies has been especially difficult .",
    "the projected luminosity profiles and isophotal shapes of simulated disk galaxy mergers are reasonably good matches to those of elliptical galaxies ( eg .",
    "barnes 1988 ; hernquist 1992 , 1993 ; governato , reduzzi , & rampazzo 1993 ; heyl , hernquist , & spergel 1994 ) , but few workers have investigated the projected _ kinematics _ of simulated merger remnants .",
    "hernquist ( 1992 , 1993 ) described principal - axis profiles of projected mean velocity and velocity dispersion for several disk - disk merger remnants , and heyl , hernquist , & spergel ( 1996 ) studied line of sight velocity distributions for a somewhat larger sample of objects .",
    "these studies showed that kinematic misalignments of merger remnants are observable , and indicated that skewness of line profiles could provide information on the initial orientations of the merging disks .",
    "however , while systematically exploring different projections , these studies were limited to equal - mass mergers , and did not examine the structure of line profiles in detail or map velocity fields in two dimensions .",
    "therefore , we studied line of sight velocity distributions for a larger sample of simulated merger remnants .",
    "we examined eight mergers between disk galaxies with mass ratios of 1:1 and another eight mergers between disk galaxies with mass ratios of 3:1 .",
    "we limited our analysis to a single projection along the intermediate axis of each remmant , but we complement a extensive presentation of major - axis kinematics with detailed examinations of individual line profiles and with two - dimensional maps of key kinematic parameters .",
    "this work extends the studies described above to unequal - mass mergers , clarifies the connection between initial conditions and line profile , and provides predictions to be compared with kinematic studies of early - type galaxies using the next generation of integral - field spectrometers .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the rest of section  1 describes the merger simulations and the methods we use to extract line of sight velocity distributions and represent the distributions with gauss - hermite parameters .",
    "sections  2 and  3 present the results for the equal - mass and unequal - mass mergers , respectively .",
    "section  4 compares our results to observational studies and summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the remnants analyzed here came from a modest survey of parabolic encounters between model disk galaxies ( barnes 1998 ) .",
    "each model had three components : a central bulge with a shallow cusp ( hernquist 1990 ) , an exponential / isothermal disk with constant scale height ( freeman 1970 ; spitzer 1942 ) , and a dark halo with a constant - density core ( dehnen 1993 ; tremaine et al .",
    "density profiles for these components are @xmath0 where @xmath1 is spherical radius , @xmath2 is cylindrical radius in the disk plane , and @xmath3 is distance from the disk plane .",
    "adopting simulation units with @xmath4 , the model used in the equal - mass mergers has a bulge mass of @xmath5 , a disk mass of @xmath6 , and a halo mass of @xmath7 .",
    "the bulge scale length is @xmath8 , the disk scale radius and scale height are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the halo scale radius is @xmath11 . with these parameter choices , the model has a half - mass radius @xmath12 , and the circular velocity and orbital period at this radius are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the model may be roughly scaled to the milky way by equating our units of length , mass , and time to @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "in the unequal - mass mergers , the larger model had the same parameters as listed above , while the small model was scaled down by a factor of @xmath18 in mass and @xmath19 in radius in rough accord with the standard luminosity - rotation velocity relation for disk galaxies .    each experiment used a total of @xmath20 particles , @xmath21 assigned to the luminous components , and @xmath21 assigned to the dark halos .",
    "the models were run with a tree code using a spatial resolution of @xmath22 and a time - step @xmath23 . with these integration parameters ,",
    "total energy was conserved to within @xmath24% peak - to - peak .",
    "all eight equal - mass merger simulations used the same initial orbit , leading in each case to close ( @xmath25 ) parabolic encounter .",
    "disk angles for these experiments are listed in table  [ eqmass - angles ] ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the inclination and argument of pericenter ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) , while the subscripts @xmath28 and @xmath29 label the two disks . after merging , remnants were evolved for several more dynamical times before being analyzed .",
    ".initial disk angles for equal - mass merger simulations .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     some salient properties of these merger remnants are summarized here ; for a more detailed discussion , see barnes ( 1998 ) .",
    "all sixteen remnants are ellipsoidal objects with luminosity profiles generally following a de  vaucouleurs law .",
    "the projected half - light radii @xmath30 of the equal - mass remnants range from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , while for the unequal - mass remnants @xmath30 ranges from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "fig .  [ shapes ] shows axial ratios determined from the inertia tensor for the most tightly - bound half of the luminous particles in each object . on the whole , the remnants of equal - mass mergers are triaxial or prolate , while those produced by unequal - mass mergers tend to be more oblate .      for all sixteen simulated remnants we extracted five frames , each containing @xmath21 luminous particles  that is , particles from the bulges and disks of the progenitor galaxies .",
    "each set of five frames is equally - spaced over a total of @xmath24 time units ; this interval is long enough that individual particles are sampled at effectively random orbital phases , but not long enough for the remnant to undergo significant evolution .",
    "we shifted each frame to place the potential minimum at the origin and rotated it to diagonalize the moment of inertia tensor for all particles with a potential less than @xmath35 times the minimum potential . in",
    "what follows , we use @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for the major , intermediate , and minor axes of the remnants .",
    "to measure line of sight velocity distributions as a function of position along a given axis , we created a two dimensional grid , with one dimension representing position and the other dimension representing velocity , thus simulating a slit in a spectrometer .",
    "typically , we placed the slit along the major ( @xmath36 ) axis and projected along the intermediate ( @xmath37 ) axis , although other options were used in preliminary investigations .",
    "the width of the slit was set at @xmath39 , which is roughly @xmath40% of the projected half - light radius .",
    "for each frame from each remnant , the particles falling within the slit were binned in position and velocity .",
    "the grid spacing along the slit was set to a minimum of @xmath41 and increased as necessary to keep the total number of particles falling within the range above a minimum .",
    "the width of the velocity bins was set to a fixed value of @xmath42 , spanning the velocity range @xmath43 with @xmath44 bins .",
    "to map the line of sight velocity distributions across the plane of the sky , we used a generalization of the above procedure .",
    "however , two adjustable bin dimensions were created instead of one along the given slit .",
    "after binning the data , the velocity distribution at each location was fit with a parameterized gauss - hermite series ( van der marel & franx 1993 ) .",
    "the value of each parameter was determined by combining the five frames and performing a least - squares fit ; uncertainties were estimated by comparing fits of individual frames .",
    "gauss - hermite functions are modified gaussians with additional skewness and kurtosis parameters ; they provide an effective way to parameterize the moderately non - gaussian distributions which arise in systems which have undergone incomplete violent relaxation .",
    "the formula for the fitting function is @xmath45 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 this function has five parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath48 has little physical significance in our study .",
    "the mean velocity @xmath49 and velocity dispersion @xmath50 have dimensions of velocity , while the @xmath51 and @xmath52 parameters represent the skewness and kurtosis of the velocity distribution and are dimensionless . when @xmath53 , the gauss - hermite series produces a normal gaussian profile .",
    "when @xmath51 has the same sign as @xmath49 the distribution s leading wing is broad and the trailing wing is narrow , while when @xmath51 and @xmath49 have opposite signs the trailing wing is broad and the leading wing is narrow . when @xmath54 , the distribution has a narrow peak with broad wings , and when @xmath55 , the distribution has a broad peak with narrow wings .      in order to discover which orbital families are responsible for various features in the velocity distributions , we assigned each particle to an orbit family using the algorithm described in fulton & barnes ( submitted ) .",
    "this algorithm follows each particle for a number of radial periods and classifies its orbit by examining the sequence of principal plane crossings . to save time and slightly reduce the effects of discreteness , we calculated the trajectories using a quadrupole - order expansion of the gravitational field ( white 1983 ) . for the present purpose all",
    "`` boxlet '' orbits were counted as boxes ; thus the major orbital families recognized here are z - tubes , which rotate about the minor axis , x - tubes , which rotate about the major axis , and boxes , which do not rotate .",
    "a merger of comparable - mass galaxies usually eliminates many of the initial characteristics of both galaxies in the formation of the new galaxy .",
    "the resulting remnants are supported partly by rotation and may sometimes be flattened , but the overall structure of the galaxies as well as the dynamics are radically changed .",
    "( this is in contrast to the 3:1 mergers , where the disk of the larger galaxy often survives the merger . ) furthermore , the dynamics of individual 1:1 mergers produced with different initial parameters vary greatly .      fig .",
    "[ parame ] plots the gauss - hermite parameters as functions of position along the major axis for remnant  e. this nearly oblate and rapidly rotating object was produced by a direct encounter between disks with inclinations of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; it has a fairly simple structure which contrasts the more complex cases described below .",
    "[ lsvde ] shows examples of line of sight velocity distributions at two different places in the galaxy .",
    "these distributions are shown for all the particles , and for particles sorted by orbital family ( z - tubes , x - tubes , and box orbits ) .    within one about effective radius",
    ", the mean velocity shows a roughly linear trend with position , while at larger radii the velocity profile rises more gradually and may start to level off .",
    "this shape is seen in all but one the remnants studied here , though the profile amplitude and the radius at which it levels off varies from one remnant to another .",
    "the exception , in which the outskirts of the remnant counterrotate with respect to the rest , will be described shortly .",
    "none of the 1:1 remnants attain rotation velocities comparable to their circular velocities , implying that rotation plays a relatively minor role in supporting these objects .    the velocity dispersion profile in fig .",
    "[ parame ] climbs from a local minimum at the center to a gentle peak on either side , and then falls off slowly at greater distances from the origin .",
    "similar profiles are seen in all of the 1:1 remnants ; this uniformity may be understood from the jeans equations , since all of these moderately anisotropic remnants have similar density profiles .",
    "the central regions have a large percentage of particles from the hernquist - model bulges of the progenitor galaxies . these particles still follow @xmath58 density profiles at small @xmath1 and their dispersion therefore scales as @xmath59 , producing the central minima noted above . at larger",
    "radii the rather gradual fall - off in @xmath50 may reflect the increasing contribution of dark matter , which dominates the mass budget beyond about one effective radius .    in this",
    "as in most 1:1 remnants , the @xmath51 parameter is has the same sign as the mean velocity @xmath49 ; as fig",
    ".  [ lsvde]b shows , the velocity profile has broad leading and narrow trailing wings .",
    "this asymmetric profile arises through a combination of box orbits and z - tube orbits .",
    "the former , which have a symmetric and rather narrow velocity distribution , effectively localize the peak of the profile , while the latter , which have a wide distribution with nonzero mean , populate the broad leading wing . further from the center",
    "the trend of @xmath51 with position is reversed , and the outermost points are consistent with @xmath60 ; this may occur because the outer regions of this rather oblate remnant are almost exclusively populated by z - tube orbits .    the @xmath52 profile in fig .",
    "[ parame ] shows a significant peak at the center , falls off rapidly at slightly larger radii , then appears to increase again before becoming statistically consistent with @xmath61 at the outer points plotted .",
    "all the remnants in our sample have @xmath54 at small radii and more nearly gaussian distributions at large radii . however , there are large variations from remnant to remnant , so it s not clear if the results presented for remnant  e should be considered typical . as fig .",
    "[ lsvde]a shows , the distinctly triangular shape of the velocity distribution near the center is almost entirely due to particles on box orbits .",
    "further from the center the fraction of box orbits declines and the velocity distribution of the box orbits becomes less triangular ; both of these trends tend to reduce the measured values of @xmath52 .",
    "having examined the behavior of the parameters on the major axis , we briefly describe two - dimensional maps of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion in fig .  [ mape ] .",
    "mean rotation velocities are highest in the equatorial plane , while elsewhere a roughly cylindrical rotation pattern is seen .",
    "the zero velocity contour is slightly tilted with respect to the @xmath38 axis , indicating a modest amount of rotational misalignment at larger radii .",
    "if the galaxy only contained z - tube orbits , the contours would run parallel to the @xmath38 axis ; the net streaming of particles in x - tube orbits cause the slant and misaligns the rotational axes .    on the whole",
    ", the velocity dispersion falls off rather more rapidly away from the major axis than it does along the major axis ; the dispersion contours are roughly aligned with , although rounder than , the surface density contours .",
    "note , however , the two closed contours representing dispersion _ maxima _ directly above and below the central minimum , and the vertical elongation of the next lower contour .",
    "several more examples of this feature will be presented shortly .      in equal - mass mergers ,",
    "the degree of violent relaxation depends on the initial orientations of the progenitor disks .",
    "thus in contrast to the relatively simple product of a direct encounter just described , mergers of inclined or retrograde disks produce remnants with a wide range of kinematic properties . here",
    "we describe a few examples .",
    "[ paramh ] shows gauss - hermite parameters as functions of major - axis position for remnant  h. this object is similar in shape to remnant  e but rotates more slowly than any other remnant in our sample ; it was produced by a retrograde encounter between disks with inclinations of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "in the course of the encounter , the first disk absorbed a good deal of orbital angular momentum , producing a spheroidal structure which rotates in the same sense as the progenitors once orbited each other .",
    "the second disk , which suffered an exactly retrograde passage , remained relatively thin and retained its original sense of rotation .",
    "this rather peculiar combination of circumstances accounts for the counterrotation seen at large radii . near the center ,",
    "the virtual slit includes a substantial fraction of particles from the first progenitor , while at larger radii the kinematics near the major axis are dominated by particles from the second disk .",
    "this produces a change in the direction of mean velocity as the distance along the major axis from the center increases .    besides its counterrotation",
    ", this remnant has other peculiar kinematic features .",
    "for example , @xmath51 and @xmath49 have opposite signs over most of the range plotted in fig .  [ paramh ] , implying that the velocity profile has narrow leading and broad trailing wings ; this is atypical for an equal - mass merger remnant .",
    "moreover , within the effective radius the @xmath52 parameter is quite high , indicating that the profile s wings are relatively broad in comparison to the overall dispersion .",
    "these broad wings may result from the superposition of two distinct velocity systems with widely - separated mean velocities .",
    "[ mapg ] presents maps of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for remnant  g , a slowly - rotating and relatively prolate object produced by a merger of disks with inclinations @xmath62 and @xmath57 .",
    "this remnant has a large population of x - tube orbits which dominate the net rotation at small radii ; the central regions thus rotate about the remnant s _ major _ axis . at larger radii the angular momentum vector",
    "is largely determined by z - tube orbits , favoring a more normal pattern of minor - axis rotation .",
    "note that the zero velocity contour is inclined with respect to the minor axis , indicating that x - tube orbits still contribute to the net rotation ; moreover , at large radii the x - tube orbits rotate in the opposite direction than they do near the center .",
    "the dispersion contours in fig .",
    "[ mapg ] are elongated perpendicular to the projected density contours , and the highest @xmath50 values are seen in two regions on the minor axis above and below the center of the remnant .",
    "an explanation for this behavior will be given shortly .",
    "as a last example of kinematic diversity among equal - mass mergers , fig .",
    "[ mapc ] presents maps of all four gauss - hermite parameters for remnant  c. like remnant  g just described , this object was produced by a merger of two inclined disks and contains a large number of x - tube orbits . within the effective radius the rotation axis",
    "is severely misaligned with the minor axis , while at larger radii the velocity contours are more nearly parallel to the minor axis .",
    "this occurs because x - tube orbits make a significant contribution to the net angular momentum at small radii , while z - tube orbits play a larger role at large radii .    along the minor axis , the velocity dispersion peaks on either side of the remnant s center .",
    "recall that such minor - axis peaks were also seen in previous dispersion maps ( figs .",
    "[ mape ] and  [ mapg ] ) . in remnants  c and  g the locations of these peaks and",
    "the general shape of the high - dispersion regions resembles the spatial distribution of x - tube orbits .",
    "such orbits encircle the waists of prolate galaxies , and travel roughly along the @xmath37 axis  that is , towards or away from the virtual observer  in the regions of peak dispersion .",
    "further evidence that x - tube orbits are responsible for these peaks appears in fig .",
    "[ lsvdc ] , which compares velocity profiles near the center and near a peak of the dispersion .",
    "the central profile , symmetric and relatively narrow , is dominated by box orbits . in contrast , the profile near the peak is dominated by x - tubes ; with some x - tubes rotating in one direction and the rest in the other direction , the velocity distribution becomes broader .",
    "this effect is strong in remnants  c and  g because they have large populations of x - tube orbits .    if the x - tube population was `` cold '' , so that most particles stayed close to the closed orbits which parent them , the x - tube distribution at the peaks would be composed of two counterrotating streams and corresponding peaks would also occur in the @xmath52 map .",
    "no such peaks are seen in fig .",
    "[ mapc ] ; instead , the @xmath52 map shows a broad ridge of high values extending diagonally from lower left to upper right .",
    "the @xmath51 map , on the other hand , shows a gradient running along the same diagonal , with low values at the lower left and high values at the upper right .",
    "these patterns are considerably clearer than those seen in the other 1:1 remnants ; most of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 maps we have examined seem too noisy to yield definite results .",
    "but we do not yet understand even the relatively simple patterns in the present example .",
    "for example , whereas @xmath49 and @xmath51 vary together in the central region of remnant  e ( see fig .  [ parame ] ) , here the contours of @xmath49 and @xmath51 are roughly orthogonal within one effective radius .",
    "further modeling is needed to disentangle the roles of different orbit families and determine the range of behavior consistent with dynamical equilibrium .",
    "mergers between galaxies of significantly different masses are less violent than equal - mass mergers . for sufficiently large mass ratios , the more massive galaxy may survive essentially unscathed . of the eight 3:1 mergers we examined ,",
    "six have similar kinematic parameter curves and oblate shapes .",
    "this kinematic uniformity arises because the larger disk basically survives the merging process .",
    "[ paramb1 ] plots the gauss - hermite parameters as functions of position along the major axis for remnant  b@xmath64 .",
    "this remnant was produced by a merger between a large disk with inclination @xmath65 and a small disk with inclination @xmath57 ; though somewhat more triaxial than most of the unequal - mass remnants ( see fig .  [ shapes ] ) , it serves to illustrate the kinematic structure of typical 3:1 merger remnants .",
    "velocity profiles at selected positions are shown in fig .",
    "[ lsvdb1 ] .",
    "the mean velocities along the major axis reveal a rotation curve similar to those seen in early type spiral and s0 galaxies ; the rotation velocity smoothly increases with distance from the center , then levels off at larger radii .",
    "the amplitude of this curve is nearly twice that of remnant  e ( fig .  [ parame ] ) .",
    "as the latter is the fastest rotator among our sample of equal - mass mergers , it is at once evident that the 3:1 remnants are kinematically distinct from their 1:1 counterparts .    along the major axis ,",
    "the velocity dispersion declines only gradually out to about @xmath66 , then falls off rapidly at larger radii . as fig .",
    "[ lsvdb1]a shows , the high dispersion at small radii is due to a population of box orbits associated with a central bar or triaxial bulge . at larger radii the dominant orbit family shifts from boxes to z - tubes ,",
    "most of which rotate in the same direction as the initial disk of the larger progenitor .",
    "the relatively low dispersions seen in the outer regions indicate that this disk has survived the merger without a great deal of dynamical heating .",
    "the 3:1 merger remnants often have rather complex major - axis @xmath51 curves , and remnant  b@xmath64 is no exception . within @xmath67",
    "the @xmath51 parameter has the same sign as @xmath49 ; the velocity profile has broad leading and narrow trailing wings , much as in typical 1:1 remnants .",
    "but at slightly larger @xmath68 values @xmath51 abruptly changes sign and the shape of the profile is inverted .",
    "representative profiles at @xmath69 and @xmath70 are shown in figs .",

    "[ paramb1 ] is significant , the measured values rapidly fall to near zero further from the center .",
    "there is some hint that @xmath52 actually becomes negative at intermediate @xmath68 , but this is not compelling as most points have error bars consistent with @xmath71 .",
    "the three rightmost points have positive @xmath52 values which appear significant ; these may be due to incomplete phase mixing as no corresponding upturn is seen on the other side .",
    "[ mapb1 ] presents maps of all four gauss - hermite parameters for remnant  b@xmath64 . as a group ,",
    "the 3:1 mergers have fairly regular velocity fields ; remnant  b@xmath64 is typical in this regard , showing somewhat faster rotation near the disk plane and a nearly cylindrical rotation pattern elsewhere . some asymmetry which may be due to a long - lived warp is evident , but the zero - velocity contour falls close to the minor axis , so there is little kinematic misalignment .",
    "the dispersion contours are somewhat elongated parallel to the minor axis , but @xmath50 falls off monotonically with increasing @xmath72 , showing no sign of the off - axis peaks noted in the 1:1 remnants .",
    "both the good kinematic alignment and the lack of off - axis dispersion peaks are expected in view of the relative scarcity of x - tube orbits in this and most other 3:1 merger remnants .",
    "the @xmath51 and @xmath52 parameter maps show definite large - scale patterns which , however , are not easy to interpret .",

    "curiously , each wing is dominated by particles from a different progenitor .      while most of the unequal - mass merger remnants in our sample are much like the one just described , two have kinematic properties somewhat reminisicent of the equal - mass remnants . these are remnants  a@xmath64 and  a@xmath73 , which  probably not by coincidence ",

    "these kinematic properties indicate that the larger disk , while only slightly thickened by the in - plane merger , has been significantly heated in the radial and azimuthal directions .",

    "during a merger , stellar orbits are scattered by the fluctuating gravitational potential .",
    "however , the potential settles down long before orbits can be completely randomized ; consequently , merger remnants preserve significant `` memories '' of their progenitors ( eg .  barnes 1998 and references therein ) . in this study",
    "we have shown that such memories can be partly recovered from the line of sight velocity profiles of merger remnants .",
    "as pointed out in sections 2.1 and 2.2.3 as well as in previous studies , kinematic misalignments are expected in merger remnants , and especially in equal - mass mergers .",

    "the incidence of severe misalignment probably depend on several factors ; for example , central density profile can have a significant impact on the phase - space available to major - axis tube orbits .",
    "until the factors which favor misalignment are better understood , it s not clear if the observed scarcity of severe kinematic misalignment can constrain the role of equal - mass mergers in the formation of elliptical galaxies .",

    "in particular , we find amplitudes of @xmath51 and @xmath52 similat to those reported in the observational studies .",
    "this shows that major merger can produce remnants with the degree of skewness and kurtosis observed in counterrotating systems .",
    "we expect that as more galaxies are observed further examples with line of sight velocity distributions similar to ours will be found .",
    "also worth noting are the observations of ngc 253 by anantharamaiah & goss ( 1996 ) which found an orthogonally rotating core which was suspected to be caused by a merger event .",
    "one of our 1:1 merger models also produced an orthogonally rotating core ( see fig .",
    "[ mapg ] ) .",
    "early - type galaxies with extended counterrotating populations are rare but not unknown .",
    "some of these systems may have formed by episodic galaxy building ( thakar & ryden 1996 ) , but others are harder to explain in this way .",
    "for example , ngc  4550 ( rubin et al .",
    "1992 ) has counterrotating disks of comparable radial extent and luminosity ; pfenniger ( 1999 ) has proposed this galaxy formed by an in - plane merger of two disk galaxies .",
    "our analysis of remnant  h shows that a somewhat wider range of merger scenarios can produce counterrotating populations .",
    "barnes and hernquist ( 1992 ) and schweizer and seitzer ( 1992 ) , among others , have suggested that s0 galaxies could be made by mergers .",
    "fisher ( 1997 ) has collected a sample of s0 galaxies with line of sight velocity distributions fit using gauss - hermite parameters . comparing his observations to our simulations",
    ", we find a good match between fisher s parameters and the parameters for our disky 3:1 mergers .",
    "the overall shapes of the gauss - hermite parameters plotted on the major axis are remarkably similar , except that our rotation curve near the origin is less steep than the observed s0 galaxies , and some details near the center of our simulations ( such as the first twist in the @xmath51 parameters ) are not apparent in fisher s data .    based on measurements of the ratio of mean velocity to velocity dispersion for a set of faint elliptical galaxies , rix , carollo , and freeman ( 1999 )",
    "have argued that these galaxies rotate too rapidly to be products of dissipationless mergers .",
    "when we compare these measurements to @xmath77 ratios we measured in our simulations ( fig .",
    "[ vsigma ] ) , we find that unequal - mass mergers can not only produce the same peak @xmath77 ratios but also produce the same relations between @xmath77 and radius . moreover , both our results and the results of rix , carollo , and freeman show similar ranges of maximum @xmath77 ratios , with values in the range of @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "we conclude that unequal mass mergers can produce remnants with the dynamics , including the @xmath77 ratios , characteristic of these faint ellipticals .",
    "this result complements a recent study by naab , burkert , & hernquist ( 1999 ) , which finds that unequal - mass mergers can also produce the disky isophotes characteristic of faint ellipticals and s0 galaxies .",
    "we have used gauss - hermite expansions to measure the line of sight velocity profiles of simulated merger remnants .",
    "even relatively modest values of @xmath80 provide enough data to obtain significant detections of non - gaussian profiles .",
    "some key results are listed below .",
    "equal - mass merger remnants exhibit a variety of kinematic features rather than any single unique `` merger signature '' .",
    "however , certain features seem common to most of the remnants in our sample ; these include slowly rotating inner regions , relatively flat dispersion profiles , off - axis dispersion peaks , and velocity distributions with broad leading and narrow trailing wings .",
    "unequal - mass merger remnants show much less variation in kinematic properties ; instead , the larger disk often survives with only moderate damage .",
    "such disk - dominated remnants are characterized by relatively rapid rotation , falling dispersion profiles , and velocity distributions with narrow leading and broad trailing wings . for mass ratios of 3:1 , between half and three - fourths of the remnants in our study had strong disk - like kinematics .",
    "simulated remnants have many kinematic characteristics similar to those observed in early - type galaxies .",
    "for example , we described counterrotating populations , misaligned rotation , and kinematically decoupled cores resembling those reported in some elliptical galaxies , and rapid rotation consistent with faint ellipticals and s0 galaxies .",
    "however , our simulations do nt always match observed galaxies .",
    "for example , the mean velocity and @xmath51 parameters usually have opposite signs in luminous elliptical galaxies ( eg .  bender , saglia , & gerhard 1994 ) , while these parameters often have the same sign in our simulated remnants . more work needs to be done to examine the connections between simulated remnants and real galaxies ; in particular , the effects of random viewing angles must be taken into account before definitive comparisons of models and observations are possible ."
