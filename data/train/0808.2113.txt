    "from last decade , rare decays induced by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) @xmath11 have become the main focus of the studies due to the cleo measurement of the radiative decay @xmath12 @xcite . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "these decays are forbidden at tree level and can only be induced by glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism @xcite via loop diagrams .",
    "hence , such decays will provide helpful information about the parameters of cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite elements as well as various hadronic form factors . in the literature",
    "there have been intensive studies on the exclusive decays @xmath13 @xcite both in the sm and beyond , where the notions @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the pseudoscalar , vector and axial vector mesons respectively .",
    "it is generally believed that supersymmetry ( susy ) is not only one of the strongest competitor of the sm but is also the most promising candidate of new physics .",
    "the reason is that it offers a unique scheme to embed the sm in a more fundamental theory where many theoretical problems such as gauge hierarchy , origin of mass , and yukawa couplings can be resolved .",
    "one direct way to search for susy is to discover susy particles at high energy colliders , but unfortunately , so far no susy particles have been found .",
    "another way is to search for its effects through indirect methods .",
    "the measurement of invariant mass spectrum , forward - backward asymmetry and polarization asymmetries are the suitable tools to probe new physics effects . for most of the susy models , the susy contributions to an observable appear at loop level due to the @xmath16-parity conservation .",
    "therefore , it has been realized for a long time that rare processes can be used as a good probe for the searches of susy , since in these processes the contributions of susy and sm arises at the same order in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "motivated from the fact that in two higgs doublet model and in other susy models , neutral higgs bosons ( nhbs ) could contribute largely to the inclusive processes @xmath2 , as part of supersymmetric contributions is proportional to the @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the physical observables , like branching ratio and forward - backward asymmetry , in the large @xmath17 region of parameter space in susy models can be quite different from that in the sm .",
    "in addition , similar effects in exclusive @xmath18 decay modes are also investigated @xcite , where the analysis of decay rates , forward - backward asymmetries and polarization asymmetries of final state lepton indicates the significant role of nhbs .",
    "it is believed that physics beyond the sm is essential to explain the problem of neutrino oscillation . to this purpose ,",
    "a number of susy so(10 ) models have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "one such model is the susy so(10 ) grand unified models ( gut ) , in which there is a complex flavor non - diagonal down - type squark mass matrix element of 2nd and 3rd generations of order one at the gut scale gut .",
    "this can induce large flavor off - diagonal coupling such as the coupling of gluino to the quark and squark which belong to different generations .",
    "these couplings are in general complex and may contribute to the process of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) .",
    "the above analysis of physical observables in @xmath19 decay is extended in susy so(10 ) gut model in ref .",
    "it is believed that the effects of the counterparts of usual chromo - magnetic and electromagnetic dipole moment operators as well as semileptonic operators with opposite chirality are suppressed by @xmath20 in the sm , but in susy so(10 ) guts their effect can be significant , since @xmath21 can be as large as 0.5 @xcite .",
    "apart from this , @xmath21 can induce new operators as the counterparts of usual scalar operators in susy models due to nhb penguins with gluino - down type squark propagator in the loop .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the forward - backward asymmetries as well as the longitudinal and transverse decay widths of @xmath19 decay , are sensitive to these nhbs effect in susy so(10 ) gut model which can be detected in the future @xmath22 factories .",
    "compared to the @xmath22 meson decays , the investigations of fcnc @xmath23 transition for bottom baryon decays @xmath24 are much behind because more degrees of freedom are involved in the bound state of baryon system at the quark level . from the experimental point of view , the only drawback of bottom baryon decays is that the production rate of @xmath25 baryon in @xmath26 quark hadronization is about four times less than that of the @xmath22 meson .",
    "theoretically , the major interest in baryonic decays can be attributed to the fact that they can offer a unique ground to extract the helicity structure of the effective hamiltonian for @xmath23 transition in the sm and beyond , which is lost in the hadronization of mesonic case .",
    "the key issue in the study of exclusive baryonic decays is to properly evaluate the hadronic matrix elements for @xmath27 , namely the transition form factors which are obviously governed by non - perturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "currently , there has been some studies in the literature on @xmath28 transition form factors in different models including pole model ( pm ) @xcite , covariant oscillator quark model ( coqm)@xcite , mit bag model ( bm)@xcite and non - relativistic quark model @xcite , qcd sum rule approach ( qcdsr ) @xcite , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite and also in the light - cone sum rules approach ( lcsr ) @xcite . using these form factors , the physical observables like decay rates , forward - backward asymmetries and polarization asymmetries of @xmath5 baryon as well as of the final state leptons in @xmath24 were studied in great details in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out that these observables are very sensitive to the new physics , for instance , the polarization asymmetries of @xmath5 baryon in @xmath29 decays heavily depend on the right handed current , which is much suppressed in the sm @xcite .    in this paper , we will investigate the exclusive decay @xmath24 ( @xmath30 = @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) both in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) as well as in the susy so(10 ) gut model @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the branching ratios , forward - backward asymmetries , lepton polarization asymmetries and polarization asymmetries of @xmath5 baryon with special emphasis on the effects of nhbs in mssm .",
    "it is pointed out that different source of the vector current could manifest themselves in different regions of phase space . for low value of momentum transfer , the photonic penguin dominates , while the @xmath33 penguin and @xmath34 box become important towards high value of momentum transfer @xcite . in order to search the region of momentum transfer with large contributions from nhbs ,",
    "the above decay in certain large @xmath35 region of parameter space has been analyzed in supergravity ( sugra ) and m - theory inspired models @xcite .",
    "we extend this analysis to the susy so(10 ) gut model @xcite , where there are some primed counterparts of the usual sm operators .",
    "for instance , the counterparts of usual operators in @xmath36 decay are suppressed by @xmath20 and consequently negligible in the sm because they have opposite chiralities .",
    "these operators are also suppressed in minimal flavor violating ( mfv ) models @xcite , however , in susy so(10 ) gut model their effects can be significant .",
    "the reason is that the flavor non - diagonal squark mass matrix elements are the free parameters and some of them have significant effects in rare decays of @xmath22 mesons @xcite . in our numerical analysis for @xmath24 decays , we shall use the results of the form factors calculated by lcsr approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the values of the relevant wilson coefficient for mssm and susy so(10 ) gut models are borrowed from ref .",
    "the effects of susy contributions to the decay rate and zero position of forward - backward asymmetry are also explored in this work .",
    "our results show that not only the decay rates are sensitive to the nhbs contribution but the zero point of the forward - backward asymmetry also shifts remarkably .",
    "it is known that the hadronic uncertainties associated with the form factors and other input parameters have negligible effects on the lepton polarization asymmetries and polarization asymmetries of @xmath5 baryon in @xmath37 decays .",
    "we have also studied these asymmetries in the susy models mentioned above and found that the effects of nhbs are quite significant in some regions of parameter space of susy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the effective hamiltonian for the dilepton decay @xmath38 .",
    "section iii contains the definitions and numbers of the form factors for the said decay using the lcsr approach . in sec .",
    "iv we present the basic formulas of physical observables like decays rate , forward - backward asymmetries ( fbas ) and polarization asymmetries of lepton and that of the @xmath8 baryon in @xmath39 .",
    "section v is devoted to the numerical analysis of these observables and the brief summary and concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "after integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom in the full theory , the general effective hamiltonian for @xmath40 in susy so(10 ) gut model , can be written as @xcite @xmath41 ,   \\label{effective haniltonian 1}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath42 @xmath43 are the four - quark operators and @xmath44 are the corresponding wilson  coefficients at the energy scale @xmath45 @xcite . using renormalization group equations to resume the qcd corrections , wilson coefficients are evaluated at the energy scale @xmath46 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties associated with the renormalization scale can be substantially reduced when the next - to - leading - logarithm corrections are included @xcite .",
    "the new operators @xmath47 @xmath48 come from the nhbs exchange diagrams , whose manifest forms and corresponding wilson coefficients can be found in @xcite .",
    "the primed operators are the counterparts of the unprimed operators , which can be obtained by flipping the chiralities in the corresponding unprimed operators .",
    "it needs to point out that these primed operators will appear only in susy so(10 ) gut model and are absent in sm and mssm @xcite .",
    "the explicit expressions of the operators responsible for @xmath24 transition are given by @xmath49with @xmath50 . in terms of the above hamiltonian",
    ", the free quark decay amplitude for @xmath23 @xmath51 can be derived as @xcite :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the momentum transfer . due to the absence of @xmath33 boson in the effective theory ,",
    "the operator @xmath55 can not be induced by the insertion of four - quark operators .",
    "therefore , the wilson coefficient @xmath56 does not renormalize under qcd corrections and hence it is independent on the energy scale .",
    "moreover , the above quark level decay amplitude can receive additional contributions from the matrix element of four - quark operators , @xmath57 , which are usually absorbed into the effective wilson coefficient @xmath58 . to be more specific",
    ", we can decompose @xmath59 into the following three parts @xcite @xmath60where the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 are defined as @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 describes the short - distance contributions from four - quark operators far away from the @xmath65 resonance regions , which can be calculated reliably in the perturbative theory .",
    "the long - distance contributions @xmath66 from four - quark operators near the @xmath65 resonance can not be calculated from first principles of qcd and are usually parameterized in the form of a phenomenological breit - wigner formula making use of the vacuum saturation approximation and quark - hadron duality .",
    "the manifest expressions for @xmath64 and @xmath66 can be written as @xcite @xmath67@xmath68with @xmath69    the non - factorizable effects @xcite from the charm loop can bring about further corrections to the radiative @xmath70 transition , which can be absorbed into the effective wilson coefficient @xmath71 . specifically , the wilson coefficient @xmath72 is given by @xcite @xmath73with @xmath74 , \\\\ g_{1}(x ) & = & { \\frac{x(x^{2}-5x-2)}{8(x-1)^{3}}}+{\\frac{3x^{2}\\mathrm{ln}^{2}x}{4(x-1)^{4}}},\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the absorptive part for the @xmath78 rescattering and we have dropped out the tiny contributions proportional to ckm sector @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , @xmath80 and @xmath81 can be obtained by replacing the unprimed wilson coefficients with the corresponding prime ones in the above formula .",
    "with the free quark decay amplitude available , we can proceed to calculate the decay amplitudes for @xmath82 and @xmath83 at hadron level , which can be obtained by sandwiching the free quark amplitudes between the initial and final baryon states .",
    "consequently , the following four hadronic matrix elements @xmath84 need to be computed .",

    "it is suggested that the soft non - perturbative contribution to the transition form factor can be calculated quantitatively in the framework of lcsr approach @xcite , which is a fully relativistic approach and well rooted in quantum field theory , in a systematic and almost model - independent way . as a marriage of standard qcdsr technique @xcite and theory of hard exclusive process @xcite , lcsr cure the problem of qcdsr applying to the large momentum transfer by performing the operator product expansion ( ope ) in terms of twist of the relevant operators rather than their dimension @xcite .",
    "therefore , the principal discrepancy between qcdsr and lcsr consists in that non - perturbative vacuum condensates representing the long - distance quark and gluon interactions in the short - distance expansion are substituted by the light cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) describing the distribution of longitudinal momentum carried by the valence quarks of hadronic bound system in the expansion of transverse - distance between partons in the infinite momentum frame .    considering the distribution amplitude up to twist-6 , the form factors for @xmath37 have been calculated in yuming to the accuracy of leading conformal spin , where the pole model was also employed to extend the results to the whole kinematical region .",
