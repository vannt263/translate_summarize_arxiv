    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) proposes a background independent framework for a theory of quantum general relativity @xcite .",
    "it realizes a canonical quantization of general relativity in 3 + 1 space - time dimensions and defines the hilbert space of quantum states of 3d space geometry and their dynamics ( through a hamiltonian constraint ) .",
    "background independence means that there is no assumed background metric at all and that the quantum state of geometry describes the whole metric of space(-time ) and not simply the perturbations of the metric field around a fixed background metric .",
    "the whole geometry of the space(-time ) needs to be reconstructed from the quantum state : all geometric notions , such as the distance , need to be constructed from scratch since you can not rely on a background geometry to define , for instance , a reference notion of distance that you could use to describe the metric perturbations .",
    "the states of 3d space geometry are ( superpositions ) of spin networks .",
    "these are equivalence classes of labelled graphs under spatial diffeomorphism .",
    "the labels come from the representation theory of the gauge group @xmath0 , representation labels on the edges and invariant tensors ( or singlet states ) at the vertices .",
    "these spin networks thus contained both algebraic ( or combinatorial ) data and topological data such as winding numbers of the edges of the graph . in the present paper",
    ", we will neglect this topological information and work with _",
    "abstract spin networks _ which are purely algebraic objects . this erases all traces of the topology of the original 3d space manifold which we quantize .",
    "this is an open issue in lqg : whether the quantum states of geometry describe both the metric and topology of space or whether they should only describe the metric state in some fixed background ( space ) topology .",
    "the standard lqg framework fixes the background topology , uses embedded spin networks and thus forbids topology changes , whereas the more recent spin foam framework ( see for example @xcite ) , which proposes a path integral formalism for lqg , uses abstract spin networks and allows transitions between different spatial topologies . more generally , it seems possible to extract some topological information from the algebraic data encoded in the spin network ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , on the other hand , the topological degrees of freedom allowed in spin networks leads to interesting proposals , such as a possible inclusion of the standard model for particles in lqg @xcite .",
    "it is essential to better understand the quantum geometry defined by spin networks and how a classical metric can emerge .",
    "a first step would be to develop the concept of _ distance _ on a spin network .",
    "since we are in a completely background independent context and that the spin network ought to define the ( quantum ) state of geometry , the algebraic and combinatorial structures of the spin networks must induce a ( natural ) notion of distance on the  quantum manifold \" defined by the spin network .",
    "moreover , since there is no background metric defining a reference frame , there is no concept of the  position \" of a part of the spin network and we have to deal with _ relations _ between parts of the spin network .",
    "it is therefore natural to try to reconstruct a notion of distance between two parts of the spin network as a function of the correlations between these parts , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "developing a notion of distance , close and far , is a necessary tool to defining a proper coarse - graining procedure of the spin network , which would not rely on an assumed embedding of the spin network in a fixed background manifold but solely on the spin network state itself .",
    "the goal is not to assume but to derive the embedding of the spin network into a classical manifold , which would define its semi - classical limit .",
    "such coarse - graining would thus allow to study the emergence of a classical metric in lqg and the semi - classical dynamics of the theory .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the mathematics of the spin networks and we describe the quantum states of geometry defined by lqg .",
    "we insist that the spin networks are wave functions of the geometry / metric and we remind their interpretation as probability amplitudes .    in section [ arearenorm ] , we remind the definition of surfaces in lqg and describe the ( quantum ) surface states .",
    "surfaces can be thought as made of elementary quantum surfaces patched up together .",
    "we define a coarse - graining of these quantum surfaces in the spirit of the area renormalisation introduced in @xcite .",
    "we explain how renormalisation flow reflects the structure of surface i.e how the elementary surfaces are patched together to form the big surface .    in section [ coarse ]",
    ", we introduce a notion of coarse - grained state of a bounded region of the spin network and we discuss the properties of the coarse - grained state . more details on the relation between the coarse - graining and the usual operation of partial tracing is presented in appendix . in section",
    "[ entanglement ] , we use that tool in order to define the entanglement and correlation between two parts of the spin network .",
    "finally in section [ theidea ] , we argue that these correlations define a natural notion of distance between parts of the spin network . this distance would be determined solely from the algebraic structure of the spin network and would not rely on any background structure .",
    "such a relationship between geometrical quantities ( such as the distance or the metric ) and informational concepts ( such correlations ) supports the growing link between ( loop ) quantum gravity and quantum information @xcite .",
    "loop quantum gravity is a canonical formulation of general relativity , describing the ( quantum ) evolution of the 3d metric @xmath1 on a spatial slice @xmath2 of space - time .",
    "the ashtekar - barbero variables describing the 3d geometry are a @xmath0-connection @xmath3 and a triad @xmath4 ( @xmath5-valued 1-form ) which is its canonical momentum .",
    "the connection @xmath6 describes the parallel transport in the 3d space , while @xmath7 defines the 3d metric via @xmath8 . in these variables , general relativity becomes a @xmath0 gauge theory , with gauss constraints insuring the @xmath0 gauge invariance and other constraints implementing the invariance under ( space - time ) diffeomorphisms .",
    "loop quantum gravity chooses the @xmath6-polarization .",
    "we define wave functions @xmath9 and @xmath7 acts as a derivation operator .",
    "we select _ cylindrical functions _ , which depend on the field @xmath6 through a finite number of parameters .",
    "a cylindrical function is defined with respect to an oriented ( closed ) graph @xmath10 ( embedded in @xmath2 ) .",
    "let us construct the holonomies @xmath11\\in{\\mathrm{su}}(2)$ ] of the connection @xmath6 along the edges @xmath12 of @xmath10 .",
    "a cylindrical function on @xmath10 is defined as a function of these holonomies : @xmath13 ) , \\quad e\\in\\gamma.\\ ] ] moreover , we require that these functions are @xmath0 gauge invariant i.e invariant under gauge transformations of the connection @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "this translates into the requirement of @xmath0 invariance at every vertex @xmath16 of the graph @xmath10 : ( u_e[a])=(g_s(e)^-1u_e[a]g_t(e ) ) , g_v(2 ) , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the source and target vertices of the edge @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , for a fixed graph @xmath10 , we are looking at the space of functions over @xmath19 where @xmath7 and @xmath20 are the number of edges and vertices of @xmath10 respectively .",
    "this space is provided with the haar measure on @xmath21 , which defines the kinematical scalar product of lqg .",
    "this measure defines a hilbert space @xmath22 of wave functions associated to the graph @xmath10 .",
    "the invariance of the theory under spatial diffeomorphisms is taken into account by considering equivalence classes of graphs on @xmath2 under diffeomorphisms .",
    "the ( kinematical ) hilbert space of lqg , @xmath23 , is then constructed as the projective limit of the @xmath24 spaces associated to each ( equivalence class of ) graph , which implements a sum over all possible graphs . for more details",
    ", the interested reader can refer to @xcite .",
    "a basis of @xmath22 is provided by the so - called _ spin network _ functionals .",
    "these are constructed as follows .",
    "to each edge @xmath25 , we associate a @xmath0 representation labelled by a half - integer @xmath26 called _ spin_. the representation ( hilbert ) space is denoted @xmath27 and has a dimension @xmath28 . to each vertex @xmath16 , we attach an intertwiner @xmath29 , which is @xmath0-invariant map between the representation spaces @xmath27 associated to all the edges @xmath12 meeting at the vertex @xmath16 : @xmath30 since the conjugate representation @xmath31 is isomorphic to the original @xmath32 , we can alternatively consider @xmath29 as a map from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "then one can also call the intertwiner @xmath29 an _ invariant tensor _ or a _",
    "singlet state_. once the @xmath35 s are fixed , the intertwiners at the vertex @xmath16 actually form a hilbert space , which we will call @xmath36 . moreover ,",
    "considering the decomposition into irreducible representations of the tensor product @xmath37 , @xmath38 where the @xmath39 are degeneracy coefficients depending on the @xmath35 s , we call @xmath40 the subspace corresponding to the spin @xmath41 component of the tensor decomposition",
    ". then @xmath42 is actually the space of singlets @xmath43",
    "corresponding to the spin @xmath44 component .    a spin network state @xmath45 is defined as the assignment of representation labels @xmath35 to each edge and the choice of a vector @xmath46 for the vertices . to shorten the expressions",
    ", we may omit the indices and use vectorial notations , @xmath47 .",
    "the spin network state defines a wave function on the space of discrete connections @xmath19 , [ spinnetdef ] _ , [ g_e ] = g_e|_v _ e d^j_e(g_e ) _ v _ v , where we contract the intertwiners @xmath29 with the ( wigner ) representation matrices of the group elements @xmath48 in the chosen representations @xmath35 . using the orthogonality of the representation matrices for the haar measure , @xmath49 we can directly compute the scalar product between two spin network states : [ matnorm ] , , |,,= _ e _ v _ v|_v .",
    "therefore , upon choosing a basis of intertwiners for every assignment of representations @xmath50 , the spin networks provide a basis of the space @xmath22 .",
    "summing over all graphs @xmath10 , we then define the spin network basis of lqg .",
    "considering that the triad @xmath7 allows to reconstruct the metric @xmath51 and implementing @xmath7 as a derivation operator on the wave functions , one can compute the action of geometrical operators such as the area and the volume on the spin network basis .",
    "for instance , considering a graph @xmath10 and a spin network state @xmath47 , the area of an elementary surface @xmath52 transversal to a given edge @xmath12 ( and not intersecting any other edges of the graph ) will have a quantized spectrum : _",
    "_e|,,= l_p^2 s(j_e)| , , , where @xmath53 or @xmath54 upon a choice of ordering in the quantization .",
    "note that @xmath53 is the value of the casimir operator @xmath55 in the representation @xmath56 , while @xmath57 .",
    "one can also investigate the action of the volume operator and it would be seen to act only at the vertices of the graph and depend on the intertwiners @xmath29 . to sum up the situation ,",
    "the representation labels can be considered as the quantum numbers for the area while the intertwiners would be the quantum numbers for the ( 3d ) volume .",
    "this provides the spin network states with an interpretation as _",
    "discrete geometries_.    we conclude this review section with a few points on the representation theory of @xmath0 . for a given representation @xmath56 ,",
    "the trace of the representation matrices @xmath58 defines the character @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 $ ] is half the angle of the rotation , @xmath63 is a unit vector on the 2-sphere indicating the axis of the rotation and @xmath64 are the standard pauli matrices .",
    "we will write in the following @xmath65 .",
    "note that the @xmath66 s are invariant under conjugation @xmath67 .    in these variables ,",
    "the normalized haar measure on @xmath0 reads is actually the usual lebesgue measure on the 3-sphere @xmath68 . indeed with the parametrization @xmath69 , we have : @xmath70 ] : @xmath71 note that @xmath72 and that the angle @xmath73 is defined modulo @xmath74 .",

    "d^j_i(g ) = .",
    "[ identity ] this defines the maximally mixed state on the singlet space @xmath75 up to a normalization factor .",
    "even though spin network states diagonalize geometrical operators such as areas and volumes , one must not forget their definition as wave functions : they define probability distributions on the space on ( discrete ) connections .",
    "more precisely , a normalized cylindrical function @xmath76 defines a probability measure on @xmath19 : p(\\{g_e , e})_e dg_e    also contain information about the parallel transport on the 3d manifold .",
    "we give two simple examples to illustrate the use of the spin network as a probability amplitude .    consider the simplest spin network graph based on a single closed loop ( with a single vertex ) .",

    "this probability distribution is @xmath82-periodic .",

    "the states @xmath79 diagonalize the area of an elementary surface transversal to the loop .",
    "the area spectrum is @xmath88 as states above .",
    "these states are in a sense completely delocalized in @xmath73 .",
    "on the other hand , one can write states @xmath89 localizing the rotation angle of the holonomy @xmath78 defined as the following distributions : @xmath90 we can decompose these states in the @xmath79 basis : _",

    "they have an infinite expansion in the spin network basis and are not normalisable .",
    "one could write normalized states defined by gaussian packets centered around fixed values of @xmath73 to smooth out the state or by adding some regularization factors like @xmath91 , and study their @xmath41-average and their properties , but this is not the purpose of the present paper .",

    "let us consider one of these edge .",
    "we are free to label it with an arbitrary representation @xmath278 .",
    "indeed , one can then find consistent labels on the remaining internal edges , for example alternating @xmath279 on the @xmath277 edges on the loop . since @xmath41 has no constraint ,",
    "we conclude that the one - loop hilbert space has a priori an infinite dimension . however , we can gauge fix this infinity .    indeed , starting with a given consistent labelling @xmath280 of the edges of the loop ,",
    "the freedom is actually to add a spin @xmath281to all the labels .",
    "then the labelling @xmath282 provides a new consistent labelling and thus a new orthogonal spin network . to gauge fix this freedom , we need to fix the spin @xmath35 on a _ single _ edge on the loop ( we do _ not _ fix the labels on all the edges on the loop",
    ", that would be too much ) .",

    "therefore , we are gauge fixing the action of the ( gauge invariant ) holonomy operators on loops inside the region @xmath6 . since the action of the hamiltonian constraints is intimately intertwined to the holonomy operators ( see for example @xcite ) , at the end of the day , our gauge fixing could be related to gauge fixing the hamiltonian and therefore counting the number of physical degrees of freedom .",
    "actually , we already know that the gauge fixings of the holonomy operators and of the hamiltonian constraints are closely related for a topological bf - type theory .",
    "however , we expect the situation to be more subtle in 3 + 1 gravity .    back to our dimension counting , we fix the spin to @xmath41 on a given edge on the loop and we know count the exact number of consistent labelling of the other internal edges .",
    "we notice that from one edge to the next , we can only move from a representation @xmath281 to @xmath286 . then along the loop , we start at @xmath41 and we move by @xmath287 steps to finally come back to @xmath41 .",

    "a first inspiration is quantum field theory on a fixed background .",
    "considering a ( scalar ) field @xmath380 for example , the correlation @xmath381 between two points @xmath382 and @xmath383 in the vacuum state depends ( only ) on the distance @xmath384 and actually decreases as @xmath385 in the flat four - dimensional minkowski space - time . reversing the logic",
    ", one could measure the correlation @xmath381 between the value of a certain field @xmath380 at two different space - time points and define the distance in term of that correlation .",
    "indeed just as the correlations in qft contain all the information about the theory and describes the dynamics of the matter degrees of freedom , we expect in a quantum gravity theory that the correlations contained in a quantum state to fully describe the geometry of the quantum space - time defined by that state .",
    "another inspiration is the study of spin systems , in condensed matter physics and quantum information @xcite .",
    "such spin systems are very close mathematically and physically to the spin networks of lqg .",
    "the key difference is that spin systems are physical systems embedded in a fixed given background metric ( usually the flat one ) while spin networks are supposed to define that background metric themselves .",
    "looking at spin systems , we notice that the ( total ) correlation between two spins usually obey a power law with respect to the distance between these two spins .",
    "we would like to inverse this relation in the context of lqg : using a similar power law , we could reconstruct the distance between two  points \" in term of a well - defined correlation between the corresponding parts of the spin network .",

    "this is one of the inequivalent maximally entangled states of three qubits @xcite , but it is easy to check that no two subsystems are entangled ( even if they are maximally correlated in the @xmath386 basis ) . on the other hand ,    but the two other pairs are entangled . ] .",
    "interest in the role of entanglement in quantum phase transitions @xcite , which are characterized by non - analyticity in various quantities at certain values of externally - varied parameters at zero temperature , was one of the driving forces behind the investigations of entanglement in many - body systems .",
    "the most popular models are hamiltonian lattice spin systems in one , two and three spatial dimensions .",
    "recently it was shown in various models that quantum phase transitions of both first and second kinds are signalled by a non - analyticity of the entanglement measures @xcite .",
    "while the states considered are most typically the ground or thermal states of the lattice hamiltonian operator , some of the results may be usefully applied to the attempts to reconstruct geometry from the spin networks .",
    "those states typically are multipartite entangled states .",
    "one of the results that are relevant to us is that the two - qubit entanglement measures vanish very rapidly with the distance : they may become zero at the distance of four or five sites , and sometimes even the third - nearest neighbors entanglement may be zero . at the same time , the correlations may be strong , and at the critical point the correlation length may actually diverge . on the other hand ,",
    "the overall state is typically entangled , so it is the multipartite entanglement @xcite that becomes dominant .",
    "thus , it is likely that the entanglement between two parts of the spin networks could only be a good notion of distance when the two systems are very close .",
    "anyway , we only expect the entanglement on a spin network to be of the same order as the classical correlation for a pure spin network state with few vertices .",
    "we expect that as soon as we need to coarse - grain over large number of vertices and edges or if we work on superpositions of spin network states ( _ weave states _ ) , then the classical correlation would be much larger than the bipartite entanglement .",
    "an obvious criticism to the proposal of reconstructing the distance from correlations and entanglement is the existence of epr pairs : two systems far from each other can still be strongly entangled .",
    "let us first remind that typical states in quantum field theories , including the vacuum state , are entangled @xcite .",
    "any two points would be naturally entangled in the vacuum state with the correlation depending on the distance .",
    "an epr pair would correspond to the creation an anomalously strong entanglement between two given ( space ) points . nevertheless , is that we are building a statistical notion of distance , which would only hold in average and in a semi - classical setting .",
    "a small quantum effect like an epr pair would be averaged out .",
    "a second comment is that epr pairs concern correlations between matter degrees of freedom evolving in an already defined geometry while we are interested of correlations between the degrees of freedom of the ( quantum ) geometry .",
    "these correlations are supposed to fully describe the geometry at the quantum level .",
    "the equivalent of an epr pair in our context would be that the geometry at two points apparently far from each other could be strongly entangled / correlated .",
    "this would actually look as if there was a wormhole connecting these two points .",
    "this is very close to the idea of the creation of  non - local links \" in a spin network state as proposed by markopoulou and smolin @xcite , which could explain some features of dark matter in lqg . indeed , taking a spin network based on a regular 3d lattice , one can create a ",
    "non - local \" link , labelled with some representation @xmath41 , between two points far from each other on the lattice . there is no argument based on locality forbidding the creation of such a link since the spin network is defined without any reference of a background metric : the regular lattice is simply a particular embedding of the spin network into flat space and there exists other embeddings for which the two chosen points are arbitrary close to each other .",
    "nevertheless , this  non - local \" link will create some strong entanglement / correlation ( especially as @xmath41 grows ) between the two points despite their distance on the lattice : there will effectively be close as if related by a wormhole .",
    "finally , one can argue that the creation of entanglement is always local : two systems are entangled if and only if they were close at some point in time .",
    "therefore , the correlation / entanglement is actually still related to a notion of distance , although it seems more likely to reflect the possibility of being close ( or having been close ) .",
    "finally , our  close / correlated \" point of view have some simple implications for lqg , which could be ( easily ) checked through analytical or numerical computations .",
    "a first lesson is that a low spin on an edge between two vertices does not necessarily mean that these two vertices are close , since low spins tend to lead to small correlations .",
    "reversely , having no direct link between two vertices does not necessarily mean that these vertices are far , since the coarse - graining of the rest of the spin network will create a link between these two vertices which may carry strong correlations .",
    "the basic set - up for the simplest explicit calculations consists of two vertices @xmath6 and @xmath305 linked by a single edge ( our internal / fictitious link ) .",
    "we fix the spins on all the edges coming out of @xmath6 and @xmath305 and we also fix the internal edge label to a given spin @xmath41 . the state of the vertex @xmath6 is defined as an intertwiner state in @xmath387 while the vertex @xmath305 is described by an intertwiner in @xmath388 . following section [ calculation ] , we can compute the entanglement and total correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath305 .",

    "we could start by checking a first expectation : assuming that the @xmath35 s are more or less all equal , the vertices @xmath6 and @xmath305 would be close if @xmath41 is large while they get further away from each other as @xmath41 decreases .",
    "moreover , if the spins @xmath35 are large compared to @xmath41 , we expect the vertices to be far .",
    "this should hold for both notions of distance , the  information distance \" constructed from the correlation ( correlations grow with @xmath41 ) and the  geometric distance \" constructed from the volumes and areas ( the cross - section @xmath41 should grow as the vertices get closer ) .",

    "<S> abstract    after a brief review of spin networks and their interpretation as wave functions for the ( space ) geometry , we discuss the renormalisation of the area operator in loop quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> in such a background independent framework , we propose to probe the structure of a surface through the analysis of the coarse - graining and renormalisation flow(s ) of its area . </S>",
    "<S> we further introduce a procedure to coarse - grain spin network states and we quantitatively study the decrease in the number of degrees of freedom during this process . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use these coarse - graining tools to define the correlation and entanglement between parts of a spin network and discuss their potential interpretation as a natural measure of distance in such a state of quantum geometry . </S>"
