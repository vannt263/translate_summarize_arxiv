    "reveal that much of the ly@xmath1 emission of six star - forming galaxies originates in a diffuse halo surrounding the galaxy .",
    "these `` ly@xmath1 halos '' are likely caused by resonant scattering of the ly@xmath1 line off of cold , diffuse gas surrounding the galaxy .",
    "if the same process occurs at high redshift , then we would expect laes to exhibit extended ly@xmath1 emission and , since the majority of laes are resolved in the rest - uv continuum at _ hst _ resolution @xcite , the extended ly@xmath1 halos should be detectable . in a study of laes at @xmath15 , @xcite report that the majority of their sample are `` significantly more extended than point sources '' in narrow - band images with @xmath16  seeing .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : filtercurves ] , the filter used to create the @xcite sample only overlaps with the _ hst _ narrow - band filter over a @xmath30    wavelength range , so our two _ hst_/wfpc2 pointings targeted laes with ly@xmath1 lines identified spectroscopically within this region ( which corresponds to @xmath31 , see table  [ tab : phottable ] ) . the fields were observed as program go-11177 ( pi : c. gronwall ) on july 28 - 30 and august 13 - 14 2008 .",

    "there is evidence for a possible detection in lae 107 , but it lies near the edge of a wfpc2 pointing and vignetting makes this difficult to verify .",
    "we exclude this lae from subsequent analysis due to poor data quality .",
    "following @xcite , we used sextractor @xcite to identify components within the wfpc2 images , fitting a constant sky to the cutout and defining detections as fifteen contiguous pixels above a @xmath54 threshold .",
    "this procedure confirmed single detections in laes 11 and 16 , but no others within @xmath55  of the @xmath37-band lae centroids .",
    "we used the iraf routine phot to perform aperture photometry on each object in our sample , in each case using the minimum aperture that enclosed the total emission line flux seen within @xmath56 .",
    "the mean aperture size used for the sample was @xmath57 .",
    "for the two laes with clear detections , the aperture center was set to their sextractor position , while the centers for the remaining laes were set to their @xmath37-band centroids ( see * ? ? ? * and the right panels of figure  [ fig : cutouts ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we obtain monochromatic fluxes , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is in erg  @xmath27  s@xmath22 , @xmath60 is the filter transmission function , and @xmath61 is the mean value of the transmission function when convolved with the ly@xmath1 line profile @xcite . when computing @xmath61 , we have approximated the ly@xmath1 line as a gaussian with @xmath62  km  s@xmath22 and centered at its spectroscopic redshift .",
    "the resulting monochromatic fluxes are given in column  5 of table  [ tab : phottable ] .",
    "as expected , laes 11 and 16 are @xmath63-detected using phot .",
    "laes 90 and 94 also prove to be @xmath63 detections . in all laes ,",
    "the rest - uv continuum will make a small contribution to the total narrow - band flux , but its impact on the observed morphology is negligible . of the laes with phot detections ,",
    "the object with the largest relative continuum contribution ( lae 11 ) has an expected flux that is @xmath64 times smaller than the measured narrow - band flux .",
    "we also report the half - light radius of each source , interpolated individually from the curves - of - growth . for the laes without sextractor detections",
    ", these half - light radii will be biased high due to uncertainty in the source centers ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the offsets between the emission - line and rest - uv - continuum centroids of the two laes with sextractor detections are given in column  6 of table  [ tab : phottable ] .",
    "in lae 11 , the emission - line centroid is clearly offest from the rest - uv centroid ( @xmath65 ) , but is @xmath66 from the position of the northwest component in the v - band image ( see figure  [ fig : cutouts ] ) , suggesting that this component is the host for the ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "the measured ly@xmath1 centroid of lae16 is offset from the rest - uv centroid by @xmath67 , consistent with the expected uncertainties in the astrometric correction and source centroiding ( see   [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "we also computed surface brightness profiles for sets of objects in the f502n images . to do this",
    ", we first performed photometry on individual objects within a series of apertures , increasing in increments of @xmath68  pixels ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the resulting curves - of - growth were each normalized to their total flux and averaged , weighting by the inverse variance in each bin .",
    "the final stacked surface brightness profiles were computed from this stacked curve - of - growth .",
    "the results of this procedure are plotted in figure  [ fig : sbprofile ] , which shows the normalized f502n surface brightness profiles for lae 11 , lae 16 , a stack of five stars in the @xcite catalog , and a stack of all laes in the sample except for lae 11 , lae 16 , and lae 107 .",
    "in addition , we generated a series of two - dimensional gaussian models for each source , normalizing each model to its total flux . in figure  [ fig : sbprofile ] , we overplot models with @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( neither convolved with the psf ) .",
    "the stack of the lae surface brightness profiles is consistent with that of stars and is marginally consistent with the @xmath70 model .",
    "the surface brightness profile of lae 16 is consistent with that of stars and does not fit a model that is much more extended than the @xmath72 psf . the @xmath73 model is a poor fit to all of the plotted surface brightness profiles .",
    "this suggests that the line - emitting region in the majority of laes is compact ( @xmath5  kpc ) and can not be significantly more extended than the far - uv continuum emission ( @xmath6  kpc ) .",
    "the exception is lae 11 , which exhibits extended line emission out to @xmath74 ( @xmath4  kpc ) from the source center .",
    "although the @xmath75-band ( uv - continuum ) image suggests the presence of at least two components in the system , the line emission is centered on the northwest component and their separation is too great ( @xmath76 ) for the second object to be the dominant source of the extended emission .",
    "the narrow - band image also shows evidence for two distinct clumps of emission , but at a much smaller separation ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this could indicate the presence of multiple star - forming regions , a dust lane , or perhaps ly@xmath1 photons from a single star - forming region scattering from multiple clumps of gas . even considering this substructure , however , the line - emitting region is still compact ( @xmath78  kpc ) and should be indistinguishable from a point source in ground - based imaging .",
    "analysis of the surface brightness profiles can miss an extended diffuse component if the mean surface brightness is below the sky noise . to explore this possibility",
    ", we compare the monochromatic fluxes of our laes as measured in the wfpc2 frames to those measured from the ground by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see column  6 of table  [ tab : phottable ] ) .",
    "in all cases , the fluxes measured from space are within @xmath79 of those measured from the ground .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of extended emission in the individual undetected laes in our sample , but we find that a model in which we are missing @xmath80% ( @xmath10% ) of the line emission within @xmath56 of each lae is ruled at @xmath81% ( @xmath8% ) confidence .",
    "the results presented in   [ sec : results ] suggest that the ly@xmath1 emission in the majority of laes originates from a small ( @xmath5  kpc ) region that coincides very closely ( within @xmath3  kpc ) with the young stars producing the rest - frame uv continuum emission .",
    "one object in our sample ( lae 11 ) exhibits extended line emission out to @xmath4  kpc , but this is still comparable in extent to the rest - uv continuum ( @xmath82  kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "unlike the laes in our sample , low - redshift star - forming galaxies typically exhibit extended ly@xmath1 halos @xcite out to many half - light radii from the rest - frame uv emission .",
    "these galaxies are not direct analogs of the objects in our sample , as both their ly@xmath1 luminosities and specific star formation rates are far smaller than those of the typical lae .",
    "however , their ly@xmath1 halos suggest the presence of a reservoir of gas at large radii that is either not present in @xmath0 laes or is only scattering a small fraction of the ly@xmath1 photons created by star formation .    although this paper represents the first published search for extended ly@xmath1 emission in laes using _ hst _ imaging , @xcite report that @xmath15 laes are `` significantly more extended than point sources '' in narrow - band images with @xmath16  seeing .",
    "there may be a modest amount of size evolution in laes between @xmath0 and @xmath15 , but their result would seem to contradict our finding that even the most extended laes have emission - line half - light radii @xmath83 .",
    "it is possible that we have failed to account for a component of highly diffuse line emission extending to large radii , but we find it must be @xmath84% of the total line emission in the present sample .",
    "it is important that we continue to explore the wavelength - dependence of high - redshift galaxy morphologies , as different regions of the spectrum probe different physical components of the host galaxy .",
    "the sample presented here could certainly be improved , both with greater sky coverage and deeper observations .",
    "it would also be interesting to target a sample of ly@xmath1-emitting lyman break galaxies to determine how the spatial distribution of their ly@xmath1 emission differs from that of a typical lae , if at all",
