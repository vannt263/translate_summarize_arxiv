    "when the velocity flux is the burgers flux function , @xmath7 , and the coupling term @xmath8 is linear ( @xmath9 constant ) , this system constitutes a good approximation of the physical euler system with radiation @xcite , and it has been extensively studied by kawashima and nishibata @xcite , serre @xcite and ito @xcite , among others . for the details of such approximation the reader may refer to @xcite .",

    "we are interested in traveling wave solutions to system of the form @xmath13 where the triple @xmath14 is a shock front of lax type of the underlying scalar conservation law for the velocity , @xmath15 satisfying rankine - hugoniot condition @xmath16 , and lax entropy condition @xmath17 .",
    "morover , we assume genuine nonlinearity of the conservation law , namely , that the velocity flux is strictly convex , @xmath18 for all @xmath2 under consideration , for which the entropy condition reduces to @xmath19 .",
    "we refer to _ weak _ solutions of the form to the system , under the lax shock assumption for the scalar conservation law , as _ radiative shock profiles_. the existence and regularity of traveling waves of this type under hypotheses is known @xcite , even for non - convex velocity fluxes @xcite .    according to custom and without loss of generality , we can reduce to the case of a stationary profile @xmath20 , by introducing a convenient change of variable and relabeling the flux function @xmath21 accordingly . therefore , and after substitution , we consider a stationary radiative shock profile @xmath22 solution to , satisfying @xmath23 ( here @xmath24 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath25 ) , connecting endpoints @xmath26 at @xmath27 , that is , @xmath28 therefore , we summarize our main structural assumptions as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 $ ] . for concreteness let us denote @xmath31 and assume ( up to translation ) that @xmath32 . besides the previous structural assumptions we further suppose that @xmath33    [ remarkaa4]under assumption ( a4 ) , the radiative shock profile is monotone , and , as shown later on , the spectral stability condition holds .",
    "let us stress that , within the analysis of the linearized problem and of the nonlinear stability , we only need ( a4 ) to hold at the end states @xmath34 and at the degenerating value @xmath35 .",
    "[ remarka5k ] hypotheses ( a5@xmath36 ) are a set of additional technical assumptions inherited from the present stability analysis ( see the establishment of @xmath37 energy estimates of section [ sec : damping ] below , and of pointwise reduction bounds in lemma [ lem - pttracking ] ) and are not necessarily sharp .",
    "it is worth mentioning , however , that assumptions , with @xmath38 , are satisfied , for instance , for all profiles with small - amplitude @xmath39 , in view of and @xmath40 .    in the present paper",
    ", we establish the asymptotic stability of the shock profile @xmath41 under small initial perturbation .",
    "nonlinear wave behavior for system and its generalizations has been the subject of thorough research over the last decade .",
    "the well - posedness theory is the object of study in @xcite and @xcite , both for the simplified model system and more general cases .",
    "the stability of constant states @xcite , rarefaction waves @xcite , asymptotic profiles @xcite for the model system with burgers flux has been addressed in the literature .    regarding the asymptotic stability of radiative shock profiles ,",
    "the problem has been previously studied by kawashima and nishibata @xcite in the particular case of burgers velocity flux and for linear @xmath42 , which is one of the few available stability results for _ scalar _ radiative shocks in the literature . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors establish asymptotic stability with basically the same rate of decay in @xmath43 and under fairly similar assumptions as we have here .",
    "their method , though , relies on integrated coordinates and @xmath44 contraction property , a technique which may not work for the system case ( i.e. , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "in contrast , we provide techniques which may be extrapolated to systems , enable us to handle variable @xmath47 , and provide a large - amplitude theory based on spectral stability assumptions in cases that linearized stability is not automatic ( e.g. , system case , or @xmath47 variable ) .",
    "these technical considerations are some of the main motivations for the present analysis .",
    "the nonlinear asymptotic stability of traveling wave solutions to models in continuum mechanics , more specifically , of shock profiles under suitable regularizations of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws , has been the subject of intense research in recent years ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the unifying methodological approach of these works consists of refined semigroup techniques and the establishment of sharp pointwise bounds on the green function associated to the linearized operator around the wave , under the assumption of spectral stability .",
    "a key step in the analysis is the construction of the resolvent kernel , together with appropriate spectral bounds .",
    "the pointwise bounds on the green function follow by the inverse laplace transform ( spectral resolution ) formula @xcite .",
    "the main novelty in the present case is the extension of the method to a situation in which the eigenvalue equations are written as a degenerate first order ode system ( see discussion in section [ subsec : framework ] below ) .",
    "such extension , we hope , may serve as a blueprint to treat other model systems for which the resolvent equation becomes singular .",
    "this feature is also one of the main technical contributions of the present analysis .      in the spirit of @xcite",
    ", we first consider solutions to of the form @xmath48 , being now @xmath2 and @xmath3 perturbations , and study the linearized equations of about the profile @xmath41 , which read , @xmath49 with initial data @xmath50 ( functions @xmath51 are defined in ) .",
    "hence , the laplace transform applied to system gives @xmath52 where source @xmath53 is the initial data @xmath54 .    as it is customary in related nonlinear wave stability analyses",
    "@xcite , we start by studying the underlying spectral problem , namely , the homogeneous version of system : @xmath55 an evident necessary condition for orbital stability is the absence of @xmath43 solutions to for values of @xmath56 in @xmath57 , being @xmath58 the eigenvalue associated to translation invariance .",
    "this strong spectral stability can be expressed in terms of the _ evans function _ , an analytic function playing a role for differential operators analogous to that played by the characteristic polynomial for finite - dimensional operators ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the main property of the evans function is that , on the resolvent set of a certain operator @xmath59 , its zeroes coincide in both location and multiplicity with the eigenvalues of @xmath59 .    in the present case and due to the degenerate nature of system",
    "( observe that @xmath60 vanishes at @xmath61 ) the number of decaying modes at @xmath62 , spanning possible eigenfunctions , depends on the region of space around the singularity ( see section [ sec : resolker ] below , remark [ rem : notconsistent ] ) .",
    "therefore , we define the following _ stability criterion _ , where the analytic functions @xmath63 ( see their definition in below ) denote the two evans functions associated with the linearized operator about the profile in regions @xmath64 , correspondingly , analytic functions whose zeroes away from the essential spectrum agree in location and multiplicity with the eigenvalues of the linearized operator or solutions of : @xmath65 our main result is then as follows .",
    "[ theo - main ] assuming  , and the spectral stability condition , then the lax radiative shock profile @xmath41 is asymptotically orbitally stable .",
    "more precisely , the solution @xmath66 of with initial data @xmath67 satisfies @xmath68 and @xmath69 for initial perturbation @xmath70 that are sufficiently small in @xmath71 , for all @xmath72 , for some @xmath73 satisfying @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath77 .",
    "the time - decay rate of @xmath3 is not optimal .",
    "in fact , it can be improved as we observe that @xmath78 and @xmath79 is expected to decay like @xmath80 ; we omit , however , the details of the proof .",
    "the second result of this paper is the verification of the spectral stability condition under particular circumstances .",
    "[ prop - verifyd ] the spectral stability condition holds under either + ( i ) @xmath81 is a constant ; or , + ( ii ) @xmath82 is sufficiently small .",
    "see appendix [ appx - condd ]",
    ".      combining theorem [ theo - main ] and proposition [ prop - verifyd ] , we partially recover the results of @xcite for the burgers flux and constant @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and at the same time extend them to general convex flux and quasilinear @xmath84 .",
    "we note that the stability result of @xcite was for all smooth shock profiles , for which the boundary ( see @xcite , thm .",
    "1.25(ii)(a ) ) is the condition @xmath85 ; that is , their results hold whenever @xmath86 . by comparison ,",
    "our results hold on the smaller set of waves for which @xmath87 ; see remark [ remarka5k ] . by estimating high - frequency contributions explicitly , rather than by the simple energy estimates used here , we could at the expense of further effort reduce these conditions to the single condition @xmath88 used to prove lemma [ lem - pttracking ] . elsewhere in the analysis ,",
    "we need only @xmath86 ; however , at the moment we do not see how to remove to recover the full result of @xcite in the special case considered there .",
    "the interest of our technique , rather , is in its generality particularly the possibility to extend to the system case and in the additional information afforded by the pointwise description of behavior , which seems interesting in its own right .      before beginning the analysis , we orient ourselves with a few simple observations framing the problem in a more standard way .",
    "consider now the inhomogeneous version @xmath89 of , with initial data @xmath90 .",
    "defining the compact operator @xmath91 and the bounded operator @xmath92 we may rewrite this as a nonlocal equation @xmath93 in @xmath2 alone . the generator @xmath94 of is a zero - order perturbation of the generator @xmath95 of a hyperbolic equation , so it generates a @xmath96 semigroup @xmath97 and an associated green distribution @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , @xmath97 and @xmath99 may be expressed through the inverse laplace transform formulae @xmath100 for all @xmath101 ( for some @xmath102 ) , where @xmath103 is the resolvent kernel of @xmath104 .",
    "collecting information , we may write the solution of using duhamel s principle / variation of constants as @xmath105 where @xmath99 is determined through .    that is , the solution of the linearized problem reduces to finding the green kernel for the @xmath2-equation alone , which in turn amounts to solving the resolvent equation for @xmath104 with delta - function data , or , equivalently , solving the differential equation with source @xmath106 .",
    "we shall do this in standard fashion by writing as a first - order system and solving appropriate jump conditions at @xmath107 obtained by the requirement that @xmath108 be a distributional solution of the resolvent equations .",
    "this procedure is greatly complicated by the circumstance that the resulting @xmath109 first - order system , given by @xmath110 is _ singular _ at the special point where @xmath60 vanishes . however , in the end we find as usual that @xmath108 is uniquely determined by these criteria , not only for the values @xmath111 guaranteed by @xmath96-semigroup theory / energy estimates , but , as in the usual nonsingular case @xcite , on the _ set of consistent splitting _ for the first - order system , which includes all of @xmath112 .",
    "this has the implication that the essential spectrum of @xmath104 is confined to @xmath113 .",
    "[ jump]the fact ( obtained by energy - based resolvent estimates ) that @xmath114 is coercive for @xmath115 shows by elliptic theory that the resolvent is well - defined and unique in class of distributions for @xmath116 large , and thus the resolvent kernel may be determined by the usual construction using appropriate jump conditions . that is , from standard considerations , we see that the construction _ must _ work , despite the apparent wrong dimensions of decaying manifolds ( which happen for any @xmath117 ) .    to deal with the singularity of the first - order system is the most delicate and novel part of the present analysis .",
    "it is our hope that the methods we use here may be of use also in other situations where the resolvent equation becomes singular , for example in the closely related situation of relaxation systems discussed in @xcite .",
    "this work is structured as follows .",

    "section [ sec : hfest ] deals with the high - frequency region by establishing energy estimates on the solution operator directly . the final section [ sec : nonlinear ] blends all previous estimations into the proof of the main nonlinear stability result ( theorem ) .",
    "we also include three appendices , which contain , a pointwise extension of the tracking lemma , the proof of spectral stability under linear coupling or small - amplitude assumptions , and the monotonicity of general scalar profiles , respectively .",
    "under definition , we may assume ( thanks to translation invariance ; see remark [ regulrem ] below ) that @xmath60 vanishes exactly at one single point which we take as @xmath118 .",
    "likewise , we know that the velocity profile is monotone decreasing ( see @xcite or lemma [ monou ] below ) , that is @xmath119 , which implies , in view of genuine nonlinearity , that @xmath120 from the profile equations we obtain , after integration , that @xmath121 for all @xmath25 , due to lax condition . therefore , substitution of the profile equations yields the relation @xmath122 which , evaluating at @xmath61 and from monotonicity of the profile , implies that @xmath123 therefore , the last condition is a consequence of the existence result ( see theorem [ existencethm ] below ) , and it will be used throughout . notice that ( a@xmath124 ) implies condition .",
