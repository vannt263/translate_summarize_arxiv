    "the answers to many important cosmological questions require large sky surveys , encompassing hundreds or thousands of square degrees .",
    "large scale structure in the universe , the power spectrum at large angular scales , and the distribution of stars in our own galaxy all rely on homogeneous , moderately deep imaging with small ( and well understood ) systematic errors , as well as enormous sky coverage . until very recently ,",
    "such data was available only from photographic plates , which , with their large physical size , fill the focal plane of schmidt telescopes .",
    "unfortunately , these plates are notoriously difficult to calibrate , with large sensitivity variations among plates and even within a given plate .",
    "nevertheless , they provide the only current source of all - sky imaging data .",
    "various projects , such as the automated plate scanner ( aps , @xcite , hereafter oa95 ) , have used digitized scans of the first palomar sky survey , to generate large area catalogs .",
    "the more recent efforts by the automatic plate measuring team ( apm , @xcite , hereafter mes ) and other groups have utilized the southern sky survey plates or scans of the more recent second palomar sky survey for this purpose . some of these projects have used only a fraction of the available data , with limited ccd calibration , which makes assessing large - scale photometric errors difficult , if not impossible . for instance , mes used a scheme to transform all of their plates onto a common photometric system , but only had ccd calibration data for about one third of their plates . in the northern sky ,",
    "the gsc - ii @xcite and the usno @xcite both provide catalogs ( based on some of the same plate material ) , but they lack accurate photometric calibration and are not targeting faint objects . only the recently begun sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) ,",
    "will provide improved data in the northern sky , and only at galactic latitudes @xmath1 .    to address these issues , and provide the community with a large catalog of sources with accurate photometry , we have produced the digitized second palomar observatory sky survey @xcite .",
    "prior papers have discussed the object detection and classification techniques , using the skicat software package @xcite , and a companion paper @xcite presents more recent artificial neural network ( ann ) and decision tree ( dt ) classifiers employed in this survey .",
    "@xcite has presented the vast ccd imaging sample obtained at the palomar 60-inch for the purpose of calibrating dposs . here",
    "we discuss the techniques used to derive the plate photometric calibration , and generate a seamless catalog of objects over the high - galactic - latitude ( @xmath2 ) northern sky .",
    "we briefly review the salient details of the dposs and ccd object detection and photometry schemes in  2 .",
    "the use of plate overlap regions to transform sets of plates on a uniform instrumental magnitude system is described in  3 .",
    "the derivation of the photometric calibration using ccd data is discussed in  4 , including our final photometric errors .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of potential applications and future developments in  5 .",
    "we note that this paper supersedes the earlier discussion of dposs calibration presented in @xcite .",
    "the poss - ii photographic survey @xcite covers the entire northern sky ( @xmath3 ) with 897 overlapping fields ( each @xmath4 , with @xmath5 spacings ) , and , unlike the old poss - i , has no gaps in the coverage .",
    "approximately half of the survey area is covered at least twice in each band , due to plate overlaps .",
    "plates were taken at the palomar 48-inch oschin schmidt telescope in three bands : blue - green , iiia - j + gg395 , @xmath6 nm ; red , iiia - f + rg610 , @xmath7 nm ; and very near - ir , iv - n + rg9 , @xmath8 nm . the bandpasses are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "typical limiting magnitudes reached are @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 deeper than the poss - i .",
    "the image quality is improved relative to the poss - i , and is comparable to the southern photographic sky surveys .",
    "the original survey plates are digitized at stsci , using modified pds scanners @xcite .",
    "the plates are scanned with 15-micron ( 1.0 arcsec ) pixels , in rasters of 23,040 square , giving @xmath13 gb / plate , or @xmath14 tb of pixel data total for the entire digital survey ( dposs ) .",
    "the preliminary astrometric solutions provided by gsc - ii @xcite are good to r.m.s .",
    "@xmath15 , and are in the process of being improved substantially .",
    "an extensive effort , centered at caltech , and with sites in italy ( osservatorio astronomico di capodimonte and osservatorio astronomico di roma ) and brazil ( observatrio nacional ) , has resulted in the processing , calibration , and cataloging of nearly all scans at @xmath16 , with the detection of all objects down to the survey limit , and star / galaxy classifications accurate to 90% or better down to @xmath17 above the detection limit . object detection and photometry is performed by skicat , a novel software system developed for this purpose @xcite .",
    "it incorporates some standard astronomical image processing packages , commercial sybase database , as well as a number of artificial intelligence ( ai ) and machine learning ( ml ) modules .",
    "we measure @xmath18 attributes per object on each plate in each filter .",
    "a subset of these are used for classification , as described in @xcite .",
    "large area detectors have always faced the problem of nonuniform illumination across the detector . the resulting effect ,",
    "primarily due to placing a square detector in a telescope with a round aperture , is called vignetting .",
    "the vignetting pattern must be removed if one is to use the data at larger radii from the plate center .",
    "a simple ( but incorrect ) approach is to assume a circularly symmetric function and apply it to the data .",
    "however , though largely radially symmetric , the pattern has finer structure , due to the bending of the plates , the filters used , etc .",
    "here we describe the procedure we have used to remove the vignetting pattern from the dposs data .",
    "this procedure is performed separately for the three filters used .",
    "basically , we stack and combine multiple dposs plate images to obtain a `` master vignetting correction '' field , in a manner analogous to generating a flat field for ccd data .",
    "because this procedure was developed after most plates were processed into catalogs , the vignetting correction image is used to derive corrections to the object magnitudes post - processing , as well as correct the actual pixel data .",
    "the following procedure was followed , using one hundred plates for each band :    * bin each plate image @xmath19 , resulting in a @xmath20 pixel image .",
    "* normalize each image by the median of its central @xmath21 region . * stack the resulting images .",
    "this results in a @xmath22 array . *",
    "for each pixel in the array , discard the ten brightest and ten faintest members , and obtain the median of the remaining eighty .",
    "this produces a single @xmath20 image , where each pixel is now a clipped median of the one hundred contributing images . *",
    "normalize the resulting image such that the maximum in the central @xmath21 pixel region is 1.0 .",
    "thus , all corrections are relative to the plate center , which is the best exposed part of the plate",
    ". contours of the master vignetting correction image in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands are shown in figure 2 ; the @xmath25 map is similar .",
    "further details of this procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "nearly all plates at @xmath16 have been processed into catalogs .",
    "the final result of this processing is the palomar - norris sky catalog ( pnsc ) , expected to contain @xmath26 galaxies and @xmath27 stars .",
    "details of the acquisition , processing , and calibration of the ccd data used to calibrate dposs are provided in @xcite . here",
    "we provide a brief overview of these data .",
    "we have imaged nearly 900 independent ccd fields for dposs calibration .",
    "the imaging targets are selected from the list of northern abell clusters @xcite , with priority given to the richest clusters closest to the field centers .",
    "this strategy increase the number of objects for both star / galaxy separation and photometric calibration .",
    "for those plates with no abell clusters , we image the plate center and two other pointings within the plate .",
    "all data are obtained at the palomar observatory 60-inch telescope with the ccd imaging cameras placed at cassegrain focus .",
    "the gunn @xmath0 filters @xcite are used , which are well matched to the dposs bandpasses ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "data are taken only on photometric nights with seeing better than @xmath28 .",
    "the mean seeing for our data is @xmath29 , with limiting magnitudes of approximately @xmath30 in @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively ( @xmath34 deeper than the plate detection limits ) . for every night that is deemed photometric ,",
    "we observe a set of gunn standards @xcite .",
    "data are processed in the usual way using the iraf data reduction package @xcite .",
    "all frames are bias subtracted and flat fielded , using a combination of dome and twilight flats .",
    "additionally , a dark sky flat field correction is generated by median filtering all of the unregistered target frames in each filter on a given night .",
    "finally , we apply a fringe correction to the @xmath33 images .",
    "the photometric standard stars observed on each night are photometered using the _ apphot _ package in iraf , and the resulting collection of between five and twelve measured instrumental magnitudes used to determine the zero - point offset , airmass term , and color term in each filter .",
    "object detection on the target frames is performed using the focas package @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 frames are processed independently , using detection parameters of @xmath35 per pixel , a 25 pixel minimum area , and a sky value estimated individually for each image .",
    "object classification is also performed by focas , and the classifications visually inspected .",
    "bright objects with incorrect classifications ( usually due to saturated pixels ) are corrected by hand .",
    "the photometric coefficients ( zero point , color term , and airmass term ) derived from the standard star observations are used to determine object magnitudes .",
    "a great advantage of poss - ii over earlier surveys is the extensive overlap between neighboring plates .",
    "adjacent plates overlap each other by @xmath36 along edges covering @xmath37 , providing @xmath38 of duplicated area for each plate pair .",
    "this compares favorably to the apm survey , whose scans typically had @xmath39 overlaps @xcite ; with the strong effect of vignetting at plate edges , the extra @xmath40 of overlap in dposs is significant .",
    "these areas each contain thousands of objects which can be used to derive the transformation of one plate s instrumental magnitude system to that of its neighbor .",
    "these transformations can be propagated across multiple boundaries to tie a contiguous set of plates onto a common photometric system .    in practice , this instrumental magnitude transformation must be mapped independently for stars and galaxies , especially for brighter magnitudes ( @xmath41 ) . although the density - to - intensity ( d - i ) transformation has been linearized using the densitometry spots on each plate , stars and galaxies nevertheless display distinct photometric behaviors .",
    "this is because the brighter pixels in stellar images populate the highly nonlinear part of the d - i relation , where small errors in the polynomial fit ( mostly due to the small number of points characterizing the `` shoulder '' of the curve ) result in larger variations in the derived intensity .",
    "pixels within galaxies occupy the more linear part of the d - i transformation , resulting in more stable and linear photometry .",
    "additionally , propagating the photometric transformations across a large number of plates ( as would be necessary to knit the whole sky ) can result in the unacceptable accumulation of ( possibly systematic ) errors .",
    "this issue was addressed by @xcite , and their technique utilized by mes to estimate the extent of such errors in the apm .",
    "a similar approach was also taken by oa95 in an analysis of galaxy counts at the north galactic pole , but that study was limited by the small overlap regions and poorer quality of poss - i . an early attempt to address the problem of plate inhomogeneities in poss - ii",
    "is discussed in @xcite .    to avoid this issue entirely ,",
    "we have elected to calibrate each plate using a sliding boxcar technique , described below .",
    "we transform each plate s eight surrounding neighbors onto the instrumental system of the center plate , match all the ccd data available for the resulting nine - plate area , and derive the photometric calibration for the center plate .",
    "the individually calibrated plates can then be quilted with no additional offsets because they are already on a calibrated , rather than instrumental , magnitude system . unlike mes and oa95",
    ", we are allowed this luxury by the large quantity of available ccd calibration data .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the processed dposs plates ( squares ) , and the available ccd data ( dots ) .",
    "first , we determine which plate pairs have overlap regions larger than @xmath42 , which removes pairs where only the heavily vignetted corners overlap .",
    "the overlap regions are matched , and the outermost 10% of the matched area is clipped on all four sides , to avoid the most heavily vignetted regions .",
    "a spline is fit to the magnitude difference of the matched objects from the two plates , as a function of instrumental magnitude , @xmath43 .",
    "this fit is performed independently for stars and galaxies in each filter ( @xmath44 ) . at faint magnitudes ( @xmath45 )",
    "we use both stars and galaxies in the independent fits , to avoid biases due to possible differences in classification between plates . at these faint magnitudes ,",
    "there are no bright pixels ( which populate the highly nonlinear part of the d - i relation ) in the stellar images .",
    "there are typically between 5,000 and 30,000 objects used to determine the transformation between a given plate pair .",
    "although significant scatter is present , especially at faint magnitudes , the mean is nevertheless well determined . at the bright end ( @xmath46 ) , where the number of objects is small and classification problems exist , points for the spline fit are placed by hand . at intermediate magnitudes ( typically @xmath47 ) , a robust locus mapping algorithm is used . finally , at the faint end ( @xmath48 ) , where incompleteness is a factor , the fit is fixed at a constant @xmath49 .",
    "these objects are in any case too faint to be photometered and classified properly , and are therefore of limited scientific use from the current survey .",
    "figure 4 shows a typical pair of plate overlaps , for galaxies ( top ) and stars ( bottom ) matched between plates 392 and 333 .",
    "the resulting spline fits are also shown .",
    "in contrast , mes defined a single coefficient , @xmath50 , to match the magnitudes between adjacent plates .",
    "while they state that the @xmath51 of a linear fit to the magnitude differences ( in their case , @xmath52 _ vs. _ @xmath53 ) is nearly as good as a higher order polynomial , we find that this is not always the case , and is certainly not true for stars ( which they do not treat ) .",
    "we therefore have elected to utilize our procedure as described above , which is more general , but requires a great deal more interaction and inspection .",
    "this process also permits us to find individual plates which behave abnormally , either due to their intrinsic properties or processing failures .    to actually transform a given plate s instrumental system to that of the reference plate for a given area",
    ", we propagate magnitude transformations through sets of up to five plate overlaps connecting the plate being transformed to the fiducial plate .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 5 , where arrows represent the transformation paths used to tie plates 392 and 452 to the center ( fiducial ) plate 391 .",
    "a plate directly adjacent to the center plate can be tied to it by up to four paths ( the green / solid arrows ) , while a plate diagonally away from the center can be tied by up to five paths ( the red / dashed arrows ) . the five plate limit is imposed to avoid propagating errors across a large number of plate overlaps .",
    "figure 6 shows the five photometric transformations derived between plates 331 and 391 .",
    "the ordinate shows the fiducial plate magnitude @xmath54 , while the abscissa shows the difference between the magnitude on the plate to be transformed , @xmath55 , and @xmath54 .",
    "rather satisfyingly , all possible convolution paths provide similar transformations for a given plate , especially for galaxies ; the @xmath51 of the differences of each path from the mean reflect the scale of photometric errors due to plate pistoning . these transformations are averaged for each plate to generate a spline @xmath56 as a function of @xmath54 , shown as the solid line in figure 6 .",
    "these plots are visually inspected for each plate pair , and instances of abnormal behavior , such as highly variable transformations , are flagged and treated by hand .",
    "this technique allows us to detect plate overlaps with unusual behaviors , and provides more stable magnitude matching than possible using a single overlap .",
    "the transformations for stars are highly nonlinear , and show much more variance than those for galaxies .",
    "this contributes to the large photometric errors in stellar photometric calibration discussed in  4.2 .",
    "figure 7 demonstrates the removal of plate - to - plate pistoning using this technique .",
    "the left panel shows galaxies in an uncorrected instrumental magnitude range of @xmath57 , from an area covering 15 plates .",
    "individual plates are evident as square patches of varying galaxy density .",
    "the right panel shows galaxies from the same area , after the instrumental magnitudes have been homogenized ; individual plates are no longer discernible .",
    "once a set of nine plates has been transformed to a common instrumental system ( that of the center plate ) , we match our ccd catalogs to the plate catalogs for that area .",
    "typically , we have between 15 and 50 ccd pointings , in the three filters ( @xmath0 ) , for a given nine plate area .",
    "this provides between 8,000 and 30,000 matched galaxies and a similar number of stars from which to derive photometric calibration .",
    "the ccd and plate data are matched , allowing for an overall offset , scale change , and rotation between the ccd - derived celestial coordinates and the plate celestial coordinates .",
    "after the mean ccd - plate coordinate offset is derived , a search radius of @xmath58 is used , and the search process iterated until the ra , dec offsets converge .",
    "typical coordinate residuals are @xmath59 , which both confirms the stated astrometric accuracy of dposs , and implies that false matches are not a significant source of added noise .",
    "a spline is fit to the difference between the ccd calibrated magnitude @xmath60 and the plate instrumental magnitude @xmath61 , in a manner identical to the plate overlap analysis . once again , this is done independently for stars and galaxies , relying on the plate - based classification ( as this classification ultimately determines which calibration will be applied ) .",
    "figure 8 shows a typical set of points and the resulting transformations between plate @xmath23 and ccd @xmath32 magnitudes , for both stars and galaxies , in a nine plate area .",
    "a linear fit is also shown ; the nonlinear spline fits are clearly necessary .",
    "the derived transformations from @xmath62 are then applied solely to the center field ( 391 in the example here ) .",
    "this method differs sharply from that employed by mes , who obtained only magnitude zero points from their ccd data .",
    "their frames , at @xmath63 in size , cover only 6% of the area of our ccd images , providing a factor of 17 fewer calibrating objects from detector area alone ; considering our deeper exposures and more numerous ccd fields ( nearly @xmath64 _ vs. _ @xmath65 ) , we have a factor of approximately one - thousand more calibration objects .",
    "the nonlinearities in the transformations to calibrated magnitudes , if not treated , can lead to incorrect number count slopes and correlation functions .",
    "an examination of the filter curves in figure 1 shows that the @xmath66 and @xmath67 transformations are likely to be free of color terms , as the plate and ccd filter systems are well matched .",
    "however , the @xmath24 filter is significantly broader and bluer than the corresponding ccd @xmath31 filter , and we may expect a color correction to be necessary . in the left panels of figure 9 ,",
    "we show the difference between calibrated plate magnitude and ccd magnitude , @xmath68 as a function of @xmath69 color , for both galaxies and stars .",
    "a strong color term is evident , especially for the stars .",
    "the galaxies do not span a significant range in @xmath69 , making the color term impossible to discern in the noise .",
    "nevertheless , this color correction is extremely important for astrophysical purposes , such as photometric redshift estimation , galaxy typing , and cluster detection .    to estimate the color correction , we calculated the median @xmath68 in bins of @xmath70 , shown as the filled squares in figure 9 .",
    "we fit a linear relation to these points , resulting in a corrected magnitude @xmath71 + 0.177\\ ] ] we apply this correction to both stars and galaxies , with the results shown in the right panels of figure 9 .",
    "the correction both removes the slope and reduces the scatter in the relations , as expected .",
    "inspection of the corresponding data for @xmath72 and @xmath73 shows that no color terms are needed for those filters , as expected from the well - matched filters for the plates and ccds .",
    "photometric errors in a plate - based survey consist of random errors within plates , zero - point variations within a plate , and plate - to - plate zero point offsets , also called pistoning .",
    "random errors are due simply to poisson noise .",
    "zero - point variations within individual plates are due both to telescope vignetting and inhomogeneous emulsion sensitivity ; these are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "plate pistoning is due to both varying emulsions between plate batches , and differences in observing conditions , such as moonlight and seeing . using both our extensive ccd calibration set , and the large plate overlap regions",
    ", we can measure the magnitude of these effects .",
    "first , we compare the calibrated plate magnitudes from a large number of plates with the corresponding ccd data .",
    "the errors measured in this procedure will include random plate photometric errors , plate - to - plate pistoning , as well as random errors from the ccd photometry . using the internal tests of the ccd data presented in @xcite , the tests in this section , and the plate overlap tests from the next section",
    ", we can decompose our measured errors into the constituent sources .",
    "we plot the plate _ vs. _",
    "ccd magnitudes in figure 10 .",
    "the @xmath74 errors for galaxies are @xmath75 at @xmath76 in the @xmath77 and @xmath33 filters , respectively .",
    "table 1 provides the average photometric errors for galaxies and stars as a function of magnitude for the three bandpasses ; these are plotted in figure 11 .",

    "we examined magnitude differences for all pairs of matched objects for plate pairs , in the same magnitude bins as with the plate _ vs.",
