    "lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) is a popular method for calculation of flow properties of porous media e.g. intrinsic permeability @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the standard lbm is regarded as an alternative method to computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) , equivalent to solving the incompressible ( or near incompressible ) navier - stokes equation . through the chapman - enskog expansion",
    ", we can show that the convergence of lbm to the incompressible navier - stokes equation in the low mach and knudsen numbers limits .",
    "however , these two methods are very different . for example",
    ", the third - order and higher - order moments are completely neglected in the isothermal navier - stokes equation while they are still @xmath0 in lbm simulations through particle distribution functions , despite that they can be negligibly small when the knudsen number ( _ kn _ ) is close to zero .",
    "therefore , the high - order moments have to be negligible if the lbm simulation is correctly working at the navier - stokes level , which has been commonly oversighted in simulating flows in porous media .    in lbm simulations , the model parameters can be correlated with the kinematic viscosity @xmath1 as follows :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the grid or lattice length , the time step , and the normalized relaxation time , respectively ; and @xmath5 therefore , we have flexibility in selecting @xmath6 for any given physical @xmath1 . in the following examples , we will demonstrate that choice of these model parameters may lead to finite @xmath7 , which incurs unintentional rarefaction effect at the navier - stokes level simulations .",
    "the intrinsic permeability depends on pore structure rather than the flow properties .",
    "first , we apply the d2q9 lbm model to simulate a pressure - driven flow along the @xmath8 direction in a 2d randomly generated quartet structure , see fig .",
    "[ fig2d : geometry ] .",
    "the applied pressure difference at the inlet and outlet is so small that the flows are in the stokes flow regime .",
    "the permeability is then calculated according to the darcy law with simulated mass flow rate .",
    "the porosity is 0.7394 and the resolutions are @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the lattice numbers in the @xmath8 and @xmath12 directions .",
    "we also increase the resolutions to 800 * 400 , and 1200 * 600 respectively .",
    "the porosity is also slightly changed to 0.7532 and 0.7578 respectively .",
    "for 3 different resolutions.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    fig .",
    "[ fig2d : tau ] shows that the permeabilities for 3 resolutions are very different even for the same @xmath4 and porous media .",
    "only when @xmath13 is close to zero , they approach to their intrinsic permeability .",
    "note , slightly different porosity will lead to very insignificant change to the intrinsic permeabilities .",
    "but the significantly different normalised permeabilities indicate that great care is required to choose right resolution and @xmath4 . if we re - plot the normalized permeability against the knudsen number , which is @xmath14 @xcite for the d2q9 and d3q19 lattice models @xcite , we find that the results also collapse into a single line especially for small _ kn _ , see fig .",
    "[ fig2d : kn ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig2d : kn ] , we can clearly see the choice of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath10 should ensure that @xmath15 to simulate intrinsic permeability .",
    "here , @xmath7 is the global value based on the whole length of the domain i.e. @xmath16 , and the local knudsen number can be much larger to invalid navier - stokes level simulation even at @xmath17 . for a large global @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath18 here",
    ", d2q9 model is not accurate enough to capture rarefaction effects .",
    "although the choice of parameter range may be wider for multi - relaxation model , the underlying mechanism is still the same , i.e. lbm simulations of intrinsic permeability should choose appropriate @xmath4 and resolution i.e. @xmath10 to ensure @xmath7 is small to exclude rarefaction effect .",
    ".,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we now use lbm to simulate a force - driven flow in a more realistic 3d porous media , see fig .  [",
    "fig : geometry ] , as another example to study intrinsic permeability .",
    "the flows here are always driven in the @xmath8 direction , and the volumetric velocity @xmath19 is used to compute the permeability @xmath20 m@xmath21 according to the darcy law when an external force @xmath22 m / s@xmath21 is applied :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is summation of the flow velocity @xmath25 over all fluid grids @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the total grid number .",
    "we only show the permeability component in the driven direction in the following discussions the same as the above 2d case .    to calculate permeabilities of two similar geometries having the same @xmath27 but @xmath28 , we can select model parameters based on eq .   to ensure both the froude number ( _ fr _ ) and reynolds number ( _ re _ ) are the same , so that the calculated distribution functions will be the same . in these two sets of parameters , one choice is to have @xmath29 ( so @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 ( so @xmath32 according to eq .  ) , and @xmath33 .",
    "thus , at the navier - stokes level , the velocity solutions of two cases satisfy @xmath34 and we have @xmath35 according to eq .  .",
    "obviously , it is consistent with the following normalized incompressible navier - stokes equation :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath16 are the characteristic velocity and length to define the normalized parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    ".   also implies that more choices are possible to produce the same result ( i.e. @xmath35 ) , e.g. , @xmath41 ( so @xmath42 ) , @xmath31 ( so @xmath43 according to eq .  ) , and @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath45 at the navier - stokes level .",
    "this analysis indicates that the same intrinsic permeability should be obtained with different choice of model parameters at the navier - stokes level .        however , both @xmath4 and @xmath27 can affect calculated value of permeability as previously reported @xcite-@xcite and demonstrated in the above 2d case . as fig .",
    "[ fig2d : kn ] shows , it is actually through @xmath7 , which indicates how far the flow is away from the navier - stokes hydrodynamics .",
    "so we examine how @xmath7 affect the calculation of intrinsic permeability in this 3d case .    the computational domain of fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] has @xmath46 voxels ( i.e. grids ) and the porosity @xmath47 of @xmath48 .",
    "the d3q19 model is used with six periodic computational boundaries .",
    "[ fig:3d permeability ] shows how the permeability changes with @xmath7 for three different values of @xmath49 .",
    "we can observe that the permeability is the same for different values of @xmath49 except at the small @xmath7 for the large @xmath49 , which is due to the increase of inertial effect while the kinematic viscosity decreases with @xmath7 via @xmath4 at a fixed lattice velocity @xmath50 .",
    "the permeabilities of the cases with smaller @xmath49 will also drop if we keep decreasing @xmath7 via @xmath4 leading to a significant increase of @xmath51 . therefore , in addition to @xmath7 , inertial effect has to be checked in calculation of intrinsic permeability . if we remove the nonlinear velocity terms in equilibrium distribution function , equivalent to solving the stokes equation i.e. the navier - stokes equation without the convective term @xcite",
    ", the permeability becomes the same for all three values of @xmath49 .     for different @xmath49.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "since the intrinsic permeability concerned here is defined by the darcy law for small @xmath51 , where the viscosity effect is dominant , it is important to choose appropriate model parameters according to eq .   to make sure both @xmath51 and @xmath7 are small in computing the intrinsic permeability .",
    "since the resolution is usually low in pore - scale simulations to avoid high computational cost , the choice of @xmath4 becomes more restricted as we need to make sure both @xmath51 and @xmath7 are small .",
    "if we can afford high resolution , rarefaction effect may be excluded at a large @xmath4 by grid refinement ."
