    "a precise determination of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) with reliable estimate of their uncertainties is crucial for the success of the physics program at the lhc experiments . on the one hand pdf uncertainties",
    "are often the dominant theoretical uncertainties for many relevant signal and background processes  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "overestimated pdf errors might hinder the discovery of new physics effects , as shown for example in  @xcite .",
    "top physics at the lhc is no exception and both top pair and single - top production present complementary and interesting properties as far as pdf determination / effects are concerned .",
    "this contribution aims to review some of the implications of pdfs for top quark physics at the lhc .    in the first part of the contribution we summarize the present status of the predictions for @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3channel single - top cross - sections , computed using different pdf sets .",
    "we show how differences in the predictions can directly be traced to both differences in the parton luminosities , and the values of physical parameters used in the pdf analyses , such as the strong coupling constant @xmath4 or the the @xmath5-quark mass , @xmath6 . in particular , we highlight the importance to account for the uncertainty on the @xmath5-quark mass for accurate predictions of single - top production at the lhc .    in the second part we study pdf induced correlations between pdfs and @xmath0/single - top cross - sections and between top and @xmath7/@xmath8 cross - sections .",
    "we briefly discuss how these correlations could be used in order to improve the accuracy of top cross - section measurements with early data at the lhc .",
    "these correlation studies are performed within the framework of the nnpdf parton analysis  @xcite which , by relying on monte carlo techniques for the estimation of uncertainties , provides an ideal tool for such statistical studies .",
    "the baseline pdf set for the studies presented in this contribution is the recently released nnpdf2.0",
    "@xcite , the first nlo global fit using the nnpdf methodology .",
    "top pair production is the main channel for top quark production at tevatron and lhc . in table  [ tab : ttbar ] we collect the predictions for the top pair cross - section at lhc 7 tev at nlo computed with the mcfm code  @xcite using different pdf sets .",
    "2cmc|c cteq6.6  @xcite & 147.7 @xmath9 6.4 pb + mstw2008  @xcite & 159.0 @xmath9 4.7 pb + nnpdf2.0  @xcite & 160.0 @xmath9 5.9 pb + abkm09  @xcite & 131.9 @xmath9 4.8 pb + herapdf1.0  @xcite & 136.4 @xmath9 4.7 pb +    we notice that the predictions from the three global fits , nnpdf2.0 , cteq6.6 and mstw08 agree at the 1-sigma level .",
    "the differences with pdf sets based on reduced datasets , abkm09 and herapdf1.0 , are larger .",
    "we note that top pair production depends strongly on the large-@xmath10 gluon , and thus using sets which do not include tevatron jet data might lead to rather different predictions for this observable .",
    "one should notice that differences between the predictions from different pdf sets also arise from the use of different values for the strong coupling constant @xmath4 .",
    "it has been shown that using a common value of @xmath4 brings predictions from different groups for various lhc observables , including top pair production , in better agreement  @xcite .",
    "once we subtract the difference introduced by different choices for @xmath4 , the remaining differences can be directly traced to differences in the pdf luminosities at the typical scale of the process .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gglumi ] , where the gluon - gluon luminosity for lhc at 7 tev is plotted for the cteq6.6 , mstw2008 and nnpdf2.0 nlo sets . for example , the lower value for the cross - section obtained using the cteq6.6 set reflects the smaller @xmath11 luminosity as compared to the other sets at @xmath12 .",
    "next we present predictions for single - top production at the lhc at 7 tev .",
    "these predictions for various pdf sets are collected in table  [ tab : singletop ] , where we present results for both the @xmath1- and @xmath13-channel single - top cross - sections computed at nlo in qcd with the mcfm code .",
    "we have used the @xmath14 ( massless ) calculation for the results presented here , recently the @xmath15 calculation , which properly takes into account the effects due to finite @xmath5-quark mass , also became available  @xcite .    while at the tevatron the contributions of @xmath1- and @xmath13-channel @xmath16 exchange to single - top production are comparable in size , at the lhc @xmath1-channel production is by far the dominant production mechanism .    from the point of view of testing the predictions from different pdf sets @xmath1-channel",
    "single - top is also very interesting due to the fact that , in the so called 5-flavour scheme ( _ i.e. _ a scheme where the @xmath5 is assumed to be a parton in the proton ) the cross - section at lo probes directly the @xmath5-quark pdf , which in turn is closely related to the gluon distribution from which it is generated radiatively .    from table  [ tab : singletop",
    "] one notices that the central predictions from the various pdf sets can differ by several times the quoted 1-sigma pdf uncertainty , @xmath17 and @xmath6 uncertainties , which can not be disentangled from the pdf uncertainties , and is thus much larger than the one obtained using other pdf sets . ] .",
    "there are different contributions to this discrepancy .",
    "the first stems from the different values of the strong coupling constant @xmath18 which are used by different parton sets . since single - top production is mediated by electroweak gauge bosons , @xmath4 enters only in radiative corrections , unlike the case of @xmath0 production discussed above , this effect is rather small .    in order to separate the differences in the single - top production cross - section which arise from the differences in the pdfs themselves and those from other physical parameters ( like @xmath6 or @xmath4 ) which also enter in the pdf analyses and in the computation of the partonic matrix element , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : bglumi ] the @xmath5-gluon parton luminosity , which determines the lo cross - section , for the cteq6.6 , mstw2008 and nnpdf2.0 nlo sets .",
    "it is clear that parton luminosities in the kinematic region relevant for single - top production differ by an amount much smaller than the cross - sections themselves , suggesting that the differences indeed come from variations of other physical parameters which enter the pdf analysis .",
    "indeed , it can be seen that the bulk of this difference is related to the different values of the @xmath5-quark mass used in the fits by the different collaborations .",
    "the nnpdf collaboration sets @xmath19 gev , cteq uses @xmath20 gev while the mstw08 fit is performed setting @xmath21 gev . in order to substantiate our claim that the different values used the @xmath5-quark mass explain the bulk of the difference for the @xmath1-channel single - top cross - section , we produced two nnpdf2.0 sets with @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev respectively .",
    "the results for the @xmath5-gluon parton luminosities for these modified sets are shown in the right plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : bglumi ] and the corresponding cross - sections for the @xmath1-channel single - top cross - section are collected in table  [ tab : singletop - mb ] .",
    "it is clear that the value of @xmath6 is anti - correlated with the @xmath24 luminosity and the @xmath1-channel single - top cross - section .    from table  [ tab : singletop - mb ]",
    "one sees that variations of the @xmath5-quark mass of the order or @xmath25 gev induce an uncertainty in the cross - section of @xmath26 pb .",
    "if we take the pdg average as the best available determination of the @xmath5-quark mass and convert it from the scheme to the pole mass scheme we obtain an uncertainty of approximately @xmath27 gev .",
    "rescaling errors , we are still left with an uncertainty in the @xmath1-channel single - top cross - section of @xmath28 pb , still larger than the typical nominal pdf uncertainties quoted in table  [ tab : singletop ] .",
    "it is also clear from table  [ tab : singletop - mb ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : bglumi ] that using a similar value of @xmath6 would bring the predictions from different pdf sets into much better agreement .",
    "the uncertainty due to @xmath6 should thus always be accounted for in the theoretical predictions for lhc single - top production .",

    "@xcite ) that parton densities induce correlations among different observables measured at hadron colliders .",
    "these can be the pdfs themselves , one pdf and a physical observable or two physical observables .",

    "the most remarkable features are that the @xmath0 cross - section at the lhc at 7 tev is mostly correlated to the gluon distribution at @xmath42 and anti - correlated with it at small-@xmath10 , with the same behaviour present for sea quark pdfs , generated radiatively from the gluon .",
    "we note also that the @xmath43- and @xmath44-quark distributions are anti - correlated with the cross - section at medium-/large-@xmath10 .    as for the case of the @xmath1-channel single - top cross - section ,",
    "we point out that the strong correlation with the gluon ( and therefore with the @xmath45- and @xmath5-quark distributions ) present for @xmath0 is now milder and peaked at medium-@xmath10 , @xmath46 , and now we find a moderate correlation at medium-/small-@xmath10 with the @xmath43 and @xmath44 pdfs , of the opposite sign as in the @xmath0 cross - section .",
