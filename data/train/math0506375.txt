    "we recall that a right - angled artin group is a group which can be described by a presentation with a finite number of generators , and a finite list of relations , each of which states that some pair of generators commutes .",
    "thus free groups and free abelian groups are examples of right - angled artin groups . to any simplicial graph @xmath5",
    "we can associate a right - angled artin group @xmath6 by having generators corresponding to the vertices of @xmath5 , and a commutation relation between two generators if and only if the corresponding vertices of @xmath7 are connected by an edge .",
    "thus , if @xmath5 has vertex set @xmath8 then @xmath9    let @xmath10 denote groups which are equipped with left - invariant metrics @xmath11 respectively . by a _ quasi - isometric embedding _ of @xmath12 into @xmath13 we shall mean a group homomorphism @xmath14 which is injective and which , for some uniform constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 , satisfies the inequality @xmath17 throughout the paper , when a finite generating set is given for a group , the group shall always be equipped with the word metric , even when no metric is specified .",
    "we note that the word metric is quasi - isometrically invariant under different choices of finite generating set .",
    "the aim of this paper is to prove that each member of a large class of right - angled artin groups , which we shall call _ planar type _",
    "right - angled artin groups , embeds _",
    "quasi - isometrically _ in some pure braid group @xmath18 , as well as in the group @xmath0 of area - preserving diffeomorphisms of the unit disk , equipped with the so - called `` hydrodynamical '' or @xmath1-norm metric .",
    "quite independently one may observe that many interesting groups may be embedded quasi - isometrically in right - angled artin groups . as a corollary , then , we obtain that all surface groups , with the exception of the three simplest non - orientable surfaces , as well as at least one hyperbolic 3-manifold group , embed quasi - isometrically in @xmath18 , for some @xmath19 , and in @xmath0 .",
    "in @xcite the authors showed that each right - angled artin group of planar type embeds in a pure braid group @xmath18 , for some @xmath19 depending on the defining graph @xmath5 .",
    "however , it was not clear whether this embedding is quasi - isometric . in the present paper",
    "we modify the construction in order to give quasi - isometric embeddings .",
    "our techniques also yield quasi - isometric embeddings of arbitrary right - angled artin groups into closed surface mapping class groups .",
    "( see theorem [ mainthm ] and corollary [ maincor ] ) .",
    "the initial motivation for the present paper , however , came from the work @xcite of benaim and gambaudo , who introduce the hydrodynamical metric @xmath20 on the group @xmath0 of volume preserving diffeomorphisms of the closed disk @xmath21 ( see section [ s : pbtodiff ] for details ) . observing that the metric @xmath20 is unbounded they proposed a study of the large - scale properties of @xmath0 with respect to this metric .",
    "their main result in this direction states that , for any @xmath22 , the free abelian and free groups , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , embed quasi - isometrically in @xmath0 . adapting their techniques to the case of right - angled artin groups we are able to show that all of the examples referred to above ( planar type right - angled artin groups , surface groups , and other hyperbolic group examples ) may also be embedded quasi - isometrically in @xmath0 with respect to @xmath20 .    it should also be stressed that we do not actually construct a quasi - isometric embedding of @xmath18 in @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , it is unknown whether @xmath18 can be embedded as a subgroup of @xmath0 or @xmath23 , and it is rather unlikely that this is possible in any natural way .",
    "for instance , it follows from the work of morita @xcite that there is no group - theoretic section of the natural homomorphism @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes a subgroup of the area - preserving diffeomorphisms which are fixed on a given set of @xmath19 disjoint closed disks in the interior of @xmath21 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ s : praaginpb ]",
    "we define planar right - angled artin groups , and prove that they embed quasi - isometrically in a pure braid group @xmath18 for large enough @xmath19 .",

    "in this section we define the notion of `` planarity '' for right - angled artin groups and show that a right - angled artin group of planar type @xmath6 may be embedded quasi - isometrically in an @xmath19-strand pure braid group @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 depends on the defining graph @xmath5 )  see corollary [ maincor ]  ( 2 ) .",
    "more generally , our techniques show that any right - angled artin group ( not necessarily of planar type ) may be embedded quasi - isometrically in the mapping class group @xmath26 of an orientable punctured surface , surface with boundary or closed surface ( with implicit restrictions on the genera in each case )  see theorem [ mainthm ] and corollary [ maincor ]  ( 1 ) . in achieving these results",
    "we do not overly concern ourselves with the problem of minimising the number @xmath19 of stands in the target pure braid group or the genera , or number of punctures or boundary components , of the surface @xmath27 when the target is the mapping class group @xmath26 .",

    "we remark that this homomorphism actually projects to an embedding into the corresponding right - angled coxeter group @xmath269 .",
    "( note that @xmath269 acts by isometries of the hyperbolic plane and that the surface subgroup obtained here is finite index in the coxeter group ) .",
    "embeddings of arbritary higher genus orientable surface groups may be obtained by simply restricting to finite index subgroups of @xmath270 .",
    "the treatment of the non - orientable case is similar but more complicated to describe ( see @xcite , section 4 ) .",
    "the fact that these embeddings are all quasi - isometric is a consequence of the method used in @xcite to prove injectivity : namely , each embedding is realised as the homomorphism induced on the fundamental groups by a locally isometric embedding of cat(0 ) cubical complexes .",
    "we refer the reader to the final sentence in the statement of theorem 1 of @xcite .",
    "other hyperbolic groups can be obtained by taking hnn extensions of surfaces , and applying the bestvina - feighn combination theorem .",
    "these are two - dimensional but have boundary not homeomorphic to the circle .",
    "an explicit construction of such an example is given below .",
    "these examples necessarily have local cut points in the boundary .",
    "it is known from work of m. kapovich and b. kleiner @xcite that the boundary of a one - ended gromov hyperbolic group which is 1-dimensional and has no local cut points is homeomorphic to either the sierpinski carpet or the menger curve .",
    "( see @xcite , section 8 , for a further discussion ) .",
    "this raises the following question which we are so far unable to resolve :    do the groups @xmath0 , @xmath18 , or @xmath26 , for @xmath27 a closed orientable surface , admit quasi - isometric embeddings of 2-dimensional hyperbolic groups with boundary homeomorphic to either a sierpinski carpet or a menger curve ?      consider the genus 2 orientable surface @xmath263 with dissection obtained as shown in figure [ f : extension ] .",
    "this defines a quasi - isometric embedding of the group @xmath270 in the right - angled artin group @xmath271 where @xmath265 denotes the five cycle graph .",
    "now form a double cover @xmath272 of @xmath263 by cutting along the @xmath273-curve and gluing two copies of the subsurface shown in figure [ f : extension ] .",
    "further modify the dissection by doubling each of the two @xmath273-curves ( replacing it with two parallel curves labelled in the same way ) .",
    "now between each pair of parallel @xmath273-curves we can define a simple closed path , labelled @xmath274 and @xmath275 , respectively .",
    "we construct a complex @xmath276 by attaching an annulus @xmath277 to our surface , joining the two curves @xmath274 and @xmath275 .",
    "we extend the dissecting curves over the new annulus @xmath277 , by drawing four segments which connect the two boundary components of @xmath277 , and which are transversely labelled @xmath278 and @xmath184 in the obvious way .",
    "we also introduce a new dissecting curve , namely the core curve of the annulus , which shall be transverely labelled @xmath279 .",
    "we also modify the right - angled artin group by adding a generator @xmath279 to @xmath97 which commutes with @xmath278 and @xmath184 , but not with @xmath273 , @xmath99 , or @xmath280 .",
    "thus @xmath96 for a new graph @xmath5 containing @xmath265 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath6 is of planar type ( in fact @xmath55 is a planar graph ) .",
    "now , the dissection of the surface , extended to the complex @xmath276 , defines a homomorphism @xmath281 .",
    "moreover , by the technique of @xcite this can easily be seen to be a quasi - isometric monomorphism : the complex @xmath276 admits a cat(0 ) squaring @xmath282 dual to the dissection , and the obvious labelling on the edges of this squaring determines a locally isometric embedding of @xmath282 into the standard cubical complex associated to @xmath6 ( see @xcite for more details ) .    finally we observe that @xmath283 is an hnn - extension .",
    "choosing a basepoint in @xmath284 and paths in @xmath284 out to the endpoints of a @xmath279-edge @xmath169 of the annulus @xmath277 we define elements @xmath285 and @xmath279 in @xmath283 corresponding to the loops @xmath286 and the path @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "we then have @xmath287 it follows from the bestvina - feighn combination theorem @xcite that @xmath283 is a word hyperbolic group .",

    "we note that many coxeter groups are gromov hyperbolic groups .",
    "in particular , januszkiewicz and wiatkowski @xcite show that there exist gromov hyperbolic right - angled coxeter groups of virtual cohomological dimension @xmath22 , for all @xmath291 .",

    "it is clear , since minimal length ( or reduced ) words for elements in @xmath296 $ ] are mapped to reduced words for elements in @xmath97 , that @xmath185 is an injective homomorphism and a quasi - isometric embedding .",
