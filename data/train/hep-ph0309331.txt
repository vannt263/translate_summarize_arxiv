    "the eigenfunctions of this integral equation are known at ll accuracy and it is therefore possible to fully reconstruct the solution .",
    "one of the motivations to include the nll contributions is to introduce running coupling effects . the logarithmic dependence introduced by the running coupling terms in the nll approximation significantly complicates the study of the equation  @xcite . during the past few years different strategies",
    "have been suggested to study the nll bfkl green s function . in a fixed coupling analysis in ref .",

    "@xcite with no approximations .",
    "in particular , the solution includes all running coupling effects and , as we do not use the angular averaged kernel , it allows for a complete study of angular dependences .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to establish the applicability of the nll solution put forward in ref . @xcite . with such intention we will solve the nll bfkl equation as originally written in  @xcite , with a particular choice of renormalisation scale .",
    "running coupling effects therefore correspond to an expansion of the one  loop running of @xmath14 in the @xmath15 scheme .",
    "a study of different schemes for the running of the coupling and choices for the renormalisation scale will be presented in a future publication .",

    "in this section we sketch the method of solution for the bfkl equation at nll accuracy proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . to write the equation in a convenient way we first perform a mellin transform of the gluon green s function , i.e. @xmath16 with such a transformation the bfkl equation in dimensional regularisation @xmath17 reads  @xcite @xmath18 where the kernel is expressed in terms of the gluon regge trajectory and the real emission component in the following way @xmath19 both @xmath20dependent parts of the kernel contain @xmath21 and @xmath22 poles .",

    "is needed to obtain the solution to a given accuracy .    in the next section",
    "we show the mathematical expressions used for the kernel in our implementation , and briefly describe the structure of the trajectory and the real emission kernel .",
    "as we have already pointed out , there are two key elements in the bfkl equation : the gluon regge trajectory , @xmath39 , which contains the function @xmath30 , and the finite real emission component of the kernel , @xmath40 .",
    "the trajectory is not infrared  finite and therefore carries a @xmath23 dependence .",

    "there are two points of interest : firstly , how the @xmath60 limit is approached , and secondly , to determine how many terms in the infinite sum of eq .",
    "( [ ours ] ) are needed to obtain the solution within a given numerical accuracy .",
    "these two points are linked because the smaller the value of @xmath23 , the more terms are necessary in the expansion to reach good accuracy , but also the better the approximation @xmath61 for @xmath62 ( as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite this approximation is used in order to write the bfkl equation as in eq .",
    "( [ nll ] ) ) . a good choice for @xmath23 is therefore characterised by being small enough for the approximation to be valid , ensuring in this way an accurate answer , while being large enough to warrant the contribution from only a finite number of terms in the expansion , so that the numerical evaluation is fast .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngplot ] we plot the contribution from successive terms in the infinite sum of eq .",
    "( [ ours ] ) to the angular integrated nll gluon green s function @xmath63 with @xmath51 being the angle between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , at @xmath66  gev , @xmath67  gev , @xmath68  gev , and for different values of the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "these values have been chosen with no other intention but to illustrate the capability of the nll formalism proposed in ref .",

    "( [ ours ] ) .",
    "it has been verified that this limit is put sufficiently high as to reproduce the solution with the required accuracy .",
    "this plot contains information about how the emission builds up , revealing in a quantitative way the fact that when the energy available for the scattering process is larger , the distribution peaks at larger values of the number of iterations . although this trend is independent of @xmath23 , the specific position of the peak is not .",

    "the result is very flat in @xmath23 for small values of this parameter , demonstrating , remarkably , the cancellation between the infrared divergences present in the gluon nll regge trajectory and those stemming from the integration of the real nll emission kernel over phase space . for larger values of @xmath23",
    "we observe a growing @xmath23dependence originating from our initial approximation @xmath77 for @xmath78 . in all the results presented in this work",
    "we have taken @xmath68  gev and checked that this choice is in a region with a very weak dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "after describing the technicalities of our method of solution we are now ready to show the behaviour of the nll gluon green s function . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale_scan ] we have calculated @xmath79 fixing @xmath80 at 30 gev and varying @xmath81 for the choice of parameter @xmath76 and @xmath82 .",
    "we start by noting the complete agreement between the iterative and analytic results at ll .",
    "it is also interesting to notice how the angular integrated nll gluon green s function evolves from being strongly peaked in the region @xmath83 for small values of @xmath38 to being more flat in @xmath81 for larger values .",
    "this behaviour is to be expected , since the bfkl equation can be reformulated as a differential equation in @xmath38 , with @xmath84 as the boundary condition at @xmath85 . in agreement with this statement",
    "we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ ours ] ) that @xmath86 . by comparing the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale_scan ] we also see how the gluon green s function evolves from the boundary condition as @xmath38 increases .",
    "although the normalisation of the gluon green s function is different between the ll and nll cases , and indeed changes with @xmath38 , the shape with respect to @xmath81 does not change too much in the @xmath87 region .",
    "this behaviour is different when @xmath88 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale_scan_delta10 ] . in this region the gluon green s function",
    "is much suppressed at nll compared to the ll case .",
    "similar results were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite when the solution to the bfkl equation was studied using the mellin transform of the angular averaged kernel , and a similar treatment of the running coupling terms as in our function @xmath30 was considered , i.e. the @xmath12 terms not resummed into @xmath13 . in ref .  @xcite it was also shown that the resummation of these @xmath12 terms improves the behaviour of the gluon green s function .",
    "we will come back to this point in a forthcoming publication .    in principle",
    ", it would be interesting to establish whether the green s function , as obtained in the present approach , exhibits the exponentially suppressed , oscillatory behaviour predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the accessible range of rapidities in our present numerical study",
    "it was not possible to verify this effect which would take place at large values of the @xmath89 ratio and @xmath38 .",
    "we now proceed to the study of the dependence on @xmath38 in the next section .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_scan ] we have plotted the evolution of @xmath90 with @xmath38 for a specific choice of @xmath81 and @xmath80 , both for the ll and nll case .",
    "we see that for this choice of momenta , there is a significant difference in the @xmath38dependence from about @xmath76",
    ". with our choice of renormalisation scale of @xmath91 , the gluon green s function rises slower with @xmath38 at nll than at ll . for the range in @xmath38 studied in this paper no inestability in the growth of the gluon",
    "green s function has been found .",
    "it is known from previous investigations in the literature  @xcite that a correct resummation of the @xmath12 terms into the running of the coupling eliminates this possible problem .",
    "we will investigate this further in the future .",
    "we study a renormalisation scale dependence by , in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_scan ] , including the results for the choices @xmath92 and @xmath93 . at ll , where the coupling does not run",
    ", we can still estimate a similar dependence to that at nll by simply choosing the fixed value of the coupling at ll to be @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this generates the band around the ll result in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_scan ] .",
    "the upper ( red ) bands are obtained for @xmath97 , while the lower ( yellow ) bands correspond to @xmath98 .",
    "this renormalisation scale dependence is very big at ll and growing with @xmath38 . for the particular selection of parameters ,",
    "the scale uncertainty is drastically reduced at nll , with a slow growth with @xmath38 .",
    "this last feature has its origin in that as @xmath38 increases , more powers of @xmath13 are effectively resummed because there is more phase space available for emission , as was seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngplot ] .",
    "the reduction in the uncertainty at nll with respect to the ll result shows how the predictive power of the theory has improved with the inclusion of radiative corrections .",
    "we will study this renormalisation scale dependence in a toy cross ",
    "section below , which will include an integration over a range of momenta .",
    "but before this , we first analyse in the next section the angular behaviour of the gluon green s function .",
    "one of the advantages of our method of solution is that we can perform studies of angular correlations in the nll bfkl gluon green s function .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle_scan ] we show the dependence of @xmath99 defined in eq .",
    "( [ aver ] ) for @xmath100  gev and @xmath101  gev , and the two values @xmath76 and @xmath82 .",
    "again we see that for smaller @xmath38 , the transverse momenta @xmath64 and @xmath65 are strongly correlated , with the bulk of the contributions to the gluon green s function coming from the region of small angles between the transverse momenta @xmath102 .",
    "we have included an investigation of the angular correlations of a toy cross section in section  [ sec : toy - cross - section ] .",
    "we now proceed to the study of the following quantity : @xmath103 which , when the gluon green s function is evaluated at ll , is proportional to the cross section at this accuracy .",
    "we therefore call it a `` toy '' cross section",
    ". a more complete study would require the use of the full nll impact factors for different physical processes , a calculation which is out of the scope of this paper . although the accuracy of the impact factors , ll , does not match that of the gluon green s function , nll , the behaviour of @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ eqs ] ) with @xmath38 will still give an indication of the intercept we can expect at nll .    the evolution of the toy cross section with @xmath38 is shown in fig .  [ fig : integrated_delta_scan ] both for the ll and the nll case .",
    "this plot is consistent with the fact that the nll corrections decrease the intercept of cross sections . with the intention to estimate the renormalisation scale dependence in the ll curve , instead of keeping the strong coupling fixed at , for example its value at the lower integration limits @xmath105",
    ", we fix it at @xmath106 as we do in the nll calculation and in our study of the gluon green s function in sections  [ sec : depend - gluon - greens]  [ sec : angul - depend - gluon ] .",
    "again we see , as in fig .  [",
    "fig : delta_scan ] , that the renormalisation scale uncertainty is reduced when going from the ll to the nll curve for our particular choice of @xmath31 .",
    "when the renormalisation scale is chosen to be larger , the effective value of the coupling is reduced and the ll rise decreases , while the size of the nll corrections , suppressed by one power of @xmath13 , diminishes .",
    "the overall effect is that the difference between the ll and nll curves is now smaller than for a lower choice of renormalisation scale .",
    "the initial decrease in @xmath104 in going beyond the ll approximation was already predicted in models adding running coupling effects to the ll evolution  @xcite .    finally , and in order to illustrate the feasibility of our calculations , in fig .",
    "[ fig : avgcostheta ] we have plotted the average value of @xmath107 , with @xmath51 being the angle between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , for the toy cross section as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "we see that as @xmath38 increases , @xmath64 and @xmath65 become increasingly decorrelated , and we see that the effect is bigger at ll than at nll .",
    "in this study we have presented a first analysis of the behaviour of the nll gluon green s function as obtained from a numerical implementation of the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . with the main purpose of showing the feasibility of our method we have taken a particular choice of renormalisation scale in the @xmath108 renormalisation scheme . other choices and schemes can be considered , and work is in progress to study them .",
    "we have shown that the convergence properties are well understood , and in particular we have demonstrated the infrared finiteness of our solution .",
    "we have also presented results on the evolution and angular dependence of the gluon green s function and a toy cross section .",
    "the intercept obtained from this procedure decreases at nll with respect to the one obtained at ll , a trend which is in agreement with results in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the change when going from ll to nll depends on the choice of renormalisation scale and further studies are needed to draw stronger conclusions .",
