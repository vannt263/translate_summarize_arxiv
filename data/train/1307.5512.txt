    "theories of critical phenomena in low dimensions are now quite well established due to the concepts of the renormalization group ( rg ) and universality .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model and the 2d @xmath3 model are two classical model systems that have considerably enhanced our understanding of these concepts .",
    "while the former exhibits an order - disorder phase transition , the physics of the latter model is better described in terms of vortex - antivortex unbinding , where the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) picture emerges  @xcite .",
    "closely related to these models , one may also consider the 2d @xmath0-state clock model defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 means interaction strength , the summation is over the nearest neighbors , and @xmath6 with @xmath7 . as can be easily seen , this model has been extensively studied as a bridge between the ising model ( @xmath8 ) and the @xmath3 model ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "but it does not mean that @xmath10 is actually required for a kt transition to be observed : rather , the kt behavior becomes possible for @xmath11 with an intermediate quasi - ordered massless phase between an ordered phase at low temperature and a disordered phase at high temperature .",
    "a hand - waving rg argument is that domain walls get so floppy to effectively provide block spins with the continuous @xmath1 symmetry over large length scales  @xcite . in order to estimate @xmath12 ,",

    "this potential form has been introduced to separate the vortex degrees of freedom from the spin - wave degrees of freedom as an approximate version of the @xmath3 model  @xcite .",
    "this villain clock model on the square lattice possesses self - duality  @xcite , predicting that @xmath20 based on the following argument  @xcite : suppose that there are only two phases .",
    "then , the phase transition should occur at the dual point @xmath21 .",
    "the villain @xmath3 model has a transition temperature around @xmath22 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "therefore , @xmath24 becomes lower than @xmath25 .",
    "however , this is against the correlation inequality  @xcite , which says that @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are arbitrary spin indices and the brakets mean statistical averages of the villain @xmath0-state clock model and that of the villain @xmath3 model , respectively , at the same temperature .",
    "it expresses an intuitively obvious idea that ordering is generally weaker in the latter model since it has a greater number of possible spin configurations , and this sort of statement holds even if we work with the cosine potential . in short , the transition temperature of the villain @xmath0-state clock model can not be lower than @xmath29 , contradicting the duality argument in the two - phase picture .",
    "therefore , the two - phase picture is not valid and we are forced to have three phases at least for @xmath23 .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn for the triangular and honeycomb lattices as well  @xcite .",
    "since this argument relies on the specific choice of @xmath30 in the villain form , one might wonder if the same conclusion can be drawn for the usual clock model with the cosine potential .",
    "for instance , a recent claim was @xmath31 based on helicity modulus  @xcite , though more recent calculations have confirmed a normal kt transition for @xmath32  @xcite . since the four - state clock model exactly belongs to the ising universality class  @xcite , the only remaining case to consider is @xmath33 .",
    "although the migdal - kadanoff rg transformation predicts only two phases  @xcite , there is ample evidence that this five - state clock model does have three phases  @xcite , and theoretical arguments for the three - phase picture have been motivated and supported by these observations .",
    "we first calculate the conformal charge @xmath34 from the leading finite - size correction of the free energy on semi - infinite strips of the square geometry  @xcite , and this also indicates the existence of a temperature region with @xmath35 as in the six - state clock model [ compare fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer](a ) and [ fig : transfer](b ) ] . even if not completely rigorous , a convincing argument for the three - phase picture originates from a field - theoretic construction  @xcite , which shows that there exists a conformally invariant point with conformal charge @xmath36 between the potts model and the clock model , and conjectures that this is where the two critical lines merge  .",
    "this conjecture is found consistent with numerical results  @xcite . in short ,",
    "the dominant consensus is that the five - state clock model belongs to the same universality class as the villain five - state clock model , where one kt transition and its dual separate three phases .    .",

    "although extensive monte carlo calculations have shown that all the other features of the transition are not inconsistent with the kt picture  @xcite , these calculations raise further questions since the transition temperatures are estimated as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively : estimates of the transition temperature @xmath41 of the @xmath3 model vary among authors  @xcite , but one can safely say @xmath49 .",
    "the point is that @xmath41 is still well below the lower transition temperature of the five - state clock model , as well as the dual point @xmath50",
    "@xcite ( see fig .  [",

    "this implies a sort of _ prematurity _ in the emergence of three phases in the five - state clock model in that the duality can not enforce it as in the villain clock model .",

    "all these signatures suggest something inherently different in the five - state clock model from the six - state clock model as well as from the four - state clock model . to sum up , the situation is that the three - phase picture looks convincing in the five - state clock model , but that consistency with the kt picture is still doubtful .    in this work ,",
    "we explicitly show that the nonvanishing helicity modulus of the five - state clock model means a residual five - fold symmetry , which is not completely washed away by spin fluctuations even at @xmath57 .",

    "if @xmath42 is fixed at zero , it is identical to the periodic boundary condition , whereas if it is fixed at @xmath59 , it corresponds to the anti - periodic boundary condition .",

    "( [ eq : y ] ) .",
    "let us begin with the 2d ising model ( @xmath8 ) on the square lattice .",
    "since @xmath64 is identically zero , its helicity modulus @xmath65 is proportional to the internal energy density , which obviously does not vanish at any temperature [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : y ] ) ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the free - energy difference between the periodic boundary condition and the anti - periodic boundary condition becomes exponentially small as the system size grows if the temperature is higher than @xmath66 in units of @xmath67 .",
    "these two facts immediately suggest that the free energy @xmath68 has a smooth barrier between @xmath69 and @xmath59 and another between @xmath70 and @xmath71 by symmetry .",
    "this speculation is directly confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftbc](a ) obtained by using the ftbc , where we see that the system is disordered but preserves its up - down symmetry .",

    "the nonvanishing helicity modulus is a finite - size effect governed by the larger length scale of the composites , which will eventually become negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "it turns out hard to examine the existence of the second length scale with numerical calculations : if there really was a second length scale , it would have to get shorter with increasing @xmath19 so that the helicity modulus would then be more sensitive to the lattice size . for this reason ,",
    "we have tried to observe the helicity modulus as a function of @xmath93 with fixing the temperature at @xmath112 well above @xmath113 .",
    "however , it appears to converge to a nonzero value at least up to @xmath114 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , implying that the second length scale , if it exists , might be still greater than this size at such high @xmath19 .",
    "we additionally note that ref .",
    "@xcite suggests a _ conspiracy _ between the clock number @xmath33 and the four - fold symmetry of the square lattice : for a unit - charge vortex located at a square plaquette , the sum of angle differences around it is @xmath115 , and there are only _ four _ angle differences , each of which can take an integer multiple of @xmath116 .",
    "it means that there should be at least one angle difference greater than @xmath116 , likely to be @xmath117 .",

    "<S> it is well - known that the @xmath0-state clock model can exhibit a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition if @xmath0 is equal to or greater than a certain threshold , which has been believed to be five . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent numerical studies indicate that helicity modulus does not vanish in the high - temperature phase of the five - state clock model as predicted by the kt scenario . by performing monte carlo calculations under the fluctuating twist boundary condition </S>",
