    "the study of meson - meson systems and their role in low and medium energy physics is of twofold interest .",
    "first , from a more basic viewpoint , the investigation of meson - meson interactions provides important information about the fundamental structure of strong interactions .",
    "this is especially true for the lightest system consisting of two pions .",
    "@xmath7 scattering at low energies is determined by chiral symmetry and therefore plays a dominant role in chiral perturbation theory . for higher energies",
    "the study of @xmath7 as well as @xmath8 scattering ( including the coupling to the @xmath9 channel ) provides essential information on the nature of scalar resonances . within a meson exchange @xmath10 model",
    "the @xmath11 turns out to be a @xmath9 bound state and the @xmath12 a @xmath9 threshold effect @xcite .",
    "second , the inclusion of meson - meson correlations is mandatory for numerous hadronic processes . in models of nucleons consisting of a quark - gluon",
    "` core ' and a meson cloud , meson - meson couplings have a large impact on the structure of nucleon form factors . in meson - exchange models of the @xmath13 interaction , which essentially include pseudoscalar and vector mesons ,",
    "one has for consistency not only to include the meson - nucleon , but also the meson - meson interaction .",
    "indeed , the correlated @xmath14-exchange contribution is of outstanding importance , providing the main part of the intermediate - range attraction .    in this work",
    "we want to demonstrate the important role of the contribution to the nucleon - nucleon @xcite interaction provided by the exchange of a correlated @xmath0 pair ( a corresponding letter has already been published  @xcite ) .",
    "the starting points are open questions concerning the structure of the @xmath6 vertex .",
    "besides the coupling constant , the @xmath6 vertex function ( like all baryon - baryon meson vertices ) contains a form factor parametrizing the extended hadron structure and characterized , in a monopole parametrization , by a cutoff mass @xmath15 . within the ( full ) bonn potential ,",
    "the best fit to the @xmath13 data requires a value of @xmath15 = 1.3 gev ; the resulting form factor modifies the one - pion - exchange potential for small distances ( r@xmath16 1 fm ) only .",
    "this ensures a tensor force which is strong enough to reproduce the deuteron properties , especially the d / s ratio and the quadrupole moment @xcite .",
    "however such a hard form factor is in contradiction to information from other sources @xcite , which all favor a considerably lower value of @xmath170.8 gev , i.e.  a rather ` soft ' form factor .",
    "obviously the solution of this problem requires the inclusion of additional ( short ranged ) tensor contributions in the bonn potential , which compensate for the effect of such a soft @xmath6 form factor .",
    "the exchange of a correlated @xmath0 pair is a natural candidate for such a contribution .",
    "indeed , the inclusion of uncorrelated @xmath0 processes in the full bonn potential already led to a reduction of the @xmath6 cutoff mass from 1.75 gev ( in the framework of a simple one - boson - exchange model ( obept )  @xcite defined likewise in time - ordered perturbation theory ) to 1.3 gev .",
    "thus a further reduction of this value is to be expected if correlated @xmath0 exchange is included .",
    "this is anyway required within the strategy advocated in the full bonn potential : namely to group @xmath7 and corresponding @xmath0 contributions together because of their counterstructure in the tensor channel . however , while the bonn potential contains already correlated @xmath7 exchange ( in terms of sharp mass @xmath18 exchange ) , the corresponding @xmath0 process is not included so far .",
    "the evaluation of correlated @xmath0 exchange ( fig .",
    "[ figinti ] ) requires the knowledge of the interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath5 mesons .",
    "we have recently derived a corresponding meson - theoretical model @xcite for @xmath0 scattering which provides good agreement with the existing empirical information .",
    "it is , however , not completely crossing symmetric , so that a direct evaluation of fig .",
    "[ figinti](d ) based on this @xmath0 interaction is not possible .",
    "therefore , as in the @xmath7 case @xcite , we first evaluate the amplitude @xmath19 including @xmath0 correlations . in a second step we use dispersion - theoretic methods to transform this amplitude into the @xmath20 ( @xmath13 ) channel and in this way",
    "obtain the contribution of fig .",
    "[ figinti](d ) .",
    "a main result will be that the exchange of a correlated @xmath0 pair indeed generates a contribution to the @xmath13 potential of sizable strength . in the pionic channel it leads to a tensor force component which is strong enough to cancel the effect of a soft form factor with @xmath171 gev .",

    "most importantly , the addition of the potential due to correlated @xmath0 exchange in the pionic channel to the dotted curve restores the original tensor force strength ; obviously it is able to counterbalance the suppression induced by the smaller @xmath186 cutoff mass .",
    "the @xmath184 partial wave is of special importance in this connection since it exclusively contains a tensor force component , which is decisive for a realistic description of deuteron properties .",
    "it should be added that the above result is in remarkable agreement with a previous calculation of the @xmath6 form factor @xcite , fig .",
    "[ figresiv ] , which consistently used the same @xmath0 @xmath41-matrix and @xmath107 transition potential , and independently arrived at @xmath15 = 1 gev .",
    "as discussed in sect .  [ sect : effcoup ] , correlated @xmath0 exchange in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels can be parametrized by sharp - mass one - boson - exchange ( obe ) potentials , provided that the effective coupling constants are allowed to become @xmath41-dependent .",
    "[ figresv ] shows such coupling constants for the exchange of a heavy @xmath171 for various chosen masses of @xmath171 .",
    "obviously the coupling becomes @xmath41-independent for a mass of 1020 mev , quite near the maximum of the correlated spectral function in fig .",
    "[ figresii ] , and the resulting coupling constant is @xmath187 .",
    "if we choose @xmath175 = 1200 mev as in @xcite , the resulting coupling constant is noticeably @xmath41-dependent ; its strength is much smaller than used in @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons for this discrepancy : first the authors of @xcite applied a @xmath188 form factor , which reduces the strength at @xmath41=0 ( relevant for @xmath13 scattering ) by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "second , the strength of the @xmath171 was phenomenologically chosen in @xcite to compensate for a much softer @xmath6 form factor , with a cutoff mass of 800 mev .",
    "( indeed a much smaller value ( @xmath189= 70 ) is sufficient to compensate for a form factor with @xmath15 = 900 mev  @xcite . )",
    "obviously correlated @xmath0 exchange can only partly explain the phenomenological @xmath171 ; another possible mechanism is correlated @xmath190 exchange @xcite ( where @xmath118 stands for correlated @xmath7 exchange in the s - wave channel ) .    in order to show that the compensation for a softer @xmath6 form factor by correlated @xmath0 exchange is valid not only for on - shell potentials , but also for @xmath13 amplitudes and observables , we extrapolate the correlated @xmath0 exchange off shell as described in sect .  [ sect : nnpot ] , add this piece to the ( full ) bonn potential ( with a reduced @xmath6 cutoff mass of 1 gev ) and solve the relativistic schroedinger equation relevant for the bonn potential .",
    "only a slight readjustment of the coupling of the isospin - one scalar meson ( @xmath191 in @xcite ) in the original bonn potential is required in order to obtain again a good description of @xmath13 phase shifts .    as table  [ tabdeut ] demonstrates convincingly the deuteron observables also can be reproduced with a considerably softer @xmath6 form factor ( characterized by @xmath15 = 1 gev ) , provided that correlated @xmath0 exchange in the pionic channel is included .",
    "since the mass of the physical @xmath2-meson is only slightly below the @xmath0 threshold , genuine pole terms have been included in the @xmath0 amplitude @xcite as well as in our model for the transition potential @xmath192 .",
    "[ figresvi](a ) shows , the contribution of such pole terms leads to a reduction of the ( imaginary ) transition potential above the @xmath0 threshold , whose amount depends on the value of the bare coupling constant @xmath106 .",
    "( the reason for our choice @xmath193 = 4.40 will be discussed later . )",
    "[ figresvi](b ) shows the resulting amplitude @xmath194 .",
    "similarly to the pionic channel , @xmath0 correlations enhance the maximum of the amplitude near threshold .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath2-meson pole terms in our dynamical model ensures that the imaginary part of the @xmath144 amplitude , and therefore the resulting @xmath13 potential , contains , besides ` true ' correlated @xmath0 exchange ( fig .",
    "[ figresvii](e ) ) generated by the non - pole parts of the corresponding amplitudes , also genuine @xmath2 exchange processes ( fig .  [ figresvii](a)-(d ) ) .",
    "corresponding propagators and vertex functions are dressed by @xmath0 loop corrections .",
    "for example , the @xmath2 propagator has the following structure ( for details we refer the reader to @xcite ) :    @xmath195    where @xmath196 and @xmath105 are bare and dressed @xmath197 vertex functions , respectively , and @xmath85 denotes the @xmath0 propagator .",
    "the bare parameters @xmath198 and @xmath199 have been adjusted such that @xmath200 has a pole at @xmath201 .",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath144 amplitude , and therefore the corresponding spectral functions , consist of a @xmath191-function at @xmath201 , which precisely corresponds to the exchange of a ( physical ) @xmath2-meson with point - like @xmath90 coupling , i.e.without any form factor .",
    "however it is important to realize that @xmath200 , and therefore the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figresvii](a)-(d ) , provide a further contribution , since @xmath0 intermediate states make the self - energy @xmath202 complex above the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "such intermediate states likewise occur at the vertices in diagrams ( b)-(d ) , leading to additional contributions to the spectral functions .",
    "[ figresviii ] shows the resulting spectral functions .",
    "note that although we assumed the bare @xmath90 coupling to be of pure vector type , small contributions to @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 occur , which are generated by the @xmath0 loops in fig .",
    "[ figresvii](b)-(d ) .",
    "first we have the @xmath191-function piece ( dashed ) ; above @xmath0 threshold we have additional contributions from diagrams [ figresvii](a)-(d ) ( dash - dotted ) which have opposite sign to the @xmath191-function .",
    "they act as vertex corrections which suppress the point - like coupling of @xmath2 exchange and thus generate a form factor effect .",
    "finally there is a sizable non - pole contribution ( dotted curve ) ; throughout it has opposite sign to the part generated by the vertex corrections and roughly counterbalances their effect , a fact found already in the pionic channel .",
    "again , after presenting the results in the @xmath41-channel , we now want to look at the corresponding on - shell potentials in the @xmath20-channel .",
    "since we deal with rather short - ranged contributions we show , as two characteristic examples , the results for the @xmath185 and @xmath206 partial waves ( fig .",
    "[ figresix ] ) .",
    "note that the bare @xmath90 coupling ( @xmath106=4.40 ) , which determines the size of diagrams ( a)-(c ) , has been chosen such that the total repulsion generated by all diagrams of fig .",
    "[ figresvii ] agrees ( at low energies ) with the effective @xmath2 exchange in the bonn potential needed empirically .",
    "the dashed curves are generated by the @xmath191-functions in fig .",
    "[ figresviii ] , with a predicted renormalized coupling constant of @xmath207= 11.0 .",
    "apparently this contribution alone provides almost the same repulsion as in the bonn potential although the coupling constant is about a factor of 2 smaller .",
    "the reason is that the phenomenological form factor in the bonn potential , with the monopole cutoff mass ( 1.5 gev ) of only twice the @xmath2 mass , leads to a strong reduction of the coupling constant in the physical region ( @xmath208(@xmath41=0)=10.6 ) .",
    "the vertex corrections ( generated by diagrams ( a)-(d ) above @xmath0 threshold ) strongly reduce the repulsion in the physical region , leading to the dash - dotted curve .",
    "this suppression is essentially cancelled by the ` true ' correlated @xmath0 exchange ( diagram [ figresvii ] ( e ) ) , as already demonstrated for the spectral functions .",
    "obviously the latter contribution is remarkably strong ; it explains about 40% of effective @xmath2 exchange .",
    "the new reduced coupling constant ( 11.0 ) is still about a factor of 2 larger than provided by customary su(3 ) estimates , which use @xmath207= 9@xmath209 .",
    "thus with @xmath210=0.55 as determined by hoehler and pietarinen @xcite we have @xmath2115 .",
    "note however that the above relation between @xmath2 and @xmath5 coupling constants is based , apart from ideal mixing , on the assumption of vanishing @xmath212 coupling .",
    "for @xmath213 unequal to zero the above relation goes into    @xmath214    thus if we take @xmath213= -@xmath215 ( which amounts to a rather small deviation from zero ) we have @xmath216 , in rough agreement with our results .",
    "such a value for the @xmath217 coupling to the nucleon and the negative sign is well conceivable , if the @xmath218 couples to the nucleon via the @xmath9 continuum @xcite .    as discussed before , for practical reasons it is convenient to parametrize also the non - pole contribution of diagram [ figresvii](e ) by an effective one - boson - exchange .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figresx ] , for the dominant vector as well as the tensor coupling .",
    "obviously they can be reasonably represented by @xmath219=8.5 , @xmath220=0.4 , and @xmath221=1120 mev . using the mass of the physical @xmath2 meson @xmath222782 mev we find a ( @xmath41-dependent ) effective @xmath2 coupling strength characterized by @xmath223 4 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the suppression of the tensor coupling , in some sense enforced in the pole terms by assuming the corresponding bare coupling to be zero , also happens in the non - pole term .",
    "after the discussion of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channel we now want to investigate the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels together since their structure is very similar .",
    "compared to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels we have important differences .",
    "first the @xmath3 as well as the @xmath4 mass lie above the @xmath0 threshold , and both particles decay with a very large width into @xmath0 .",
    "consequently their propagators now acquire a pole in the complex plane .",
    "second , in contrast to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels , the bonn potential @xcite does not contain @xmath3/@xmath4 obe contributions , which could be used to fix the bare @xmath224 and @xmath225 coupling constants , as was done in the @xmath2 channel . since there is no",
    "other _ a priori _ information about these couplings , we will in this first extrapolatory study , simply put them to zero , i.e.  take only diagrams of type [ figresvii](d ) and ( e ) into account .",
    "if , in a later stage , those couplings turn out to be needed ( e.g.  in order to obtain a quantitative fit to the @xmath13 data ) , they should be included .",
    "there is a further structural difference which has an enormous impact on the results and requires an extended discussion .",
    "in general , besides the unitarity cut for @xmath226 treated in the dispersion integral ( eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) ) , there exists a left hand cut for @xmath227 in the @xmath228 amplitude generated by @xmath20-channel poles due to nucleon and @xmath89-isobar exchange ( fig .",
    "[ fignnprpot ] ) .",
    "@xmath229 is fixed by the condition @xmath230=0 .",
    "there are two solutions for each exchange ; the largest value ( generated by nucleon exchange ) is at @xmath231 , i.e.  just below the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "consequently this branch point will influence the resulting potentials near threshold considerably .    in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels",
    "the corresponding potentials act in p - waves and are thus proportional to the @xmath0 on - shell momentum @xmath67 , with the effect that the corresponding transition potentials start to increase first when approaching the threshold , but are then suppressed by the @xmath67 factor . in this way one obtains the characteristic structure of a maximum near threshold , which we have observed in such channels .",
    "the point now is that both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are @xmath0 s - waves ; therefore the transition potentials do not contain the damping factor @xmath67 anymore .",
    "indeed , figs .",
    "[ figresxii ] and [ figresxiii ] show the overwhelming effect of the left hand cut near threshold , in both channels .",
    "it essentially remains when @xmath0 correlations ( which contain the @xmath3 resonance ) are included , although the influence of the @xmath3 is clearly seen .",
    "[ figresxiv ] shows the resulting spectral functions @xmath232 , @xmath233 , and @xmath234 .",
    "again the strong effect of the left hand cut near threshold is obvious .",
    "note also that for @xmath205 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 provide roughly similar contributions , but with opposite sign .    in fig .",
    "[ figresxv ] we present the resulting on - shell potentials in some selected partial waves . for both s - states ,",
    "the ( attractive ) @xmath3 contribution strongly dominates the result arising from the @xmath4 channel but is considerably smaller ( as far as the modulus is concerned ) compared to the corresponding piece in the @xmath2 channel , cf.fig .",
    "[ figresx ] . for @xmath206",
    "both contributions have opposite sign and roughly cancel ; the total result is negligible compared to the @xmath2 channel .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath1 , @xmath2 channels discussed before , the above results can not be suitably parametrized in terms of sharp - mass exchanges . in case of the @xmath3 , no reasonable mass",
    "can be found which works for both spectral functions ; moreover all effective coupling constants become strongly @xmath41-dependent .",
    "the basic reason is again the dominance of the left hand cut , which destroys the conventional bump structure of the spectral functions found in other channels of correlated @xmath7 and @xmath0 exchange .",
    "in this work we have determined the contribution to the @xmath13 interaction due to the exchange of a correlated @xmath0 pair between two nucleons .",
    "the correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath5 have been taken into account using a realistic meson exchange model of the @xmath0 interaction @xcite . in a first step we evaluated the @xmath41-channel amplitude @xmath24 including @xmath0 correlations .",
    "the transformation into the @xmath20-channel with the help of dispersion - theoretic methods then yields the correlated @xmath0 exchange @xmath13 potential .",
    "we have investigated four relevant channels of the @xmath0 system characterized by the quantum numbers of the physical particles @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .    in the pionic channel correlated @xmath0 exchange yields a short - ranged contribution , which roughly corresponds to an exchange of a heavy ( effective ) @xmath171 with a mass of about 1 gev .",
    "the additional tensor force generated by this potential is sufficient to compensate for a reduction of the @xmath6 cutoff mass @xmath15 from 1.3 gev to 1.0 gev in the one - pion - exchange potential . for basic theoretical reasons ,",
    "such a reduction is highly welcome , since various models of nucleon structure unanimously predict a rather soft @xmath6 form factor characterized by @xmath235 .",
    "such a small value might be reached if correlated @xmath190 exchange is included , too , which is also missing in the bonn potential .",
    "( as usual , @xmath118 stands for a low mass correlated @xmath7 pair in the @xmath236 channel . )",
    "thus it appears that in the bonn potential  @xcite the one - pion - exchange potential together with a hard form factor is an effective description of ` true ' one - pion exchange ( with a soft form factor ) plus correlated @xmath0 ( and @xmath190 ) exchange in the pionic channel .    in the @xmath2 channel , the exchange of a correlated @xmath0 pair also provides a sizable contribution to the @xmath13 interaction . since the @xmath2 mass is near the @xmath0 threshold we have included the genuine @xmath2-meson explicitly and replaced the ( effective ) @xmath2 exchange in the bonn potential by the resulting correlated @xmath0 potential , which can be decomposed into a pole and a non - pole piece .",
    "the former provides a microscopic model for ` true ' @xmath2 exchange leading to a renormalized @xmath90 coupling constant , @xmath237 = 11.0 , which is about a factor of two smaller than the effective value of 20 used in the bonn potential .",
    "thus ` true ' correlated @xmath0 exchange ( fig .",
    "[ figinti](e ) ) provides almost half of the empirical repulsion needed in the @xmath13 interaction ; it can be parametrized by sharp - mass @xmath173 exchange with @xmath238 , @xmath239 0.4 and @xmath240 1120 mev .",
    "our present result for the @xmath2 coupling constant ( @xmath241 ) is well compatible with @xmath120 , provided that there exists a small , negative @xmath212 coupling of vector type , with the magnitude of the order of the @xmath5-coupling .",
    "such a @xmath212 coupling ( especially the required negative sign ) occurs naturally if it is supposed to arise via the @xmath9 continuum .",
    "although corresponding @xmath218 exchange in the @xmath13 interaction provides only a small contribution to the repulsion , it makes the above relation between @xmath2 and @xmath5 couplings agree with @xmath120 predictions .",
    "consequently there appears to be little room for explicit quark - gluon effects in being responsible for the short - range @xmath13 repulsion .",
    "additional contributions arise in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels .",
    "they are sizable individually , mainly due to left - hand cut effects arising from nucleon and @xmath89 exchange in a @xmath0 s - wave . however , in some partial waves strong cancellations occur between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 contributions .",
    "further contributions are , in principle , generated by direct coupling of the @xmath3/@xmath4 to the nucleon .",
    "the size of such couplings is , however , not known ; these terms are therefore omitted in the present work .",
