    "for example , analogs of theorem [ thm : kakutani ] and corollary [ cor : yukawa - killing ] are known for the schrdinger equation .",
    "however , the duffin correspondence ( [ eq : harmonic_duffin ] ) and corollary [ cor : yukawa - escaping ] are not known . moreover",
    ", the results given here can not easily be calculated for the schrdinger equation .",
    "the problem is that the prospective radon  nikodym derivate of the measure associated with the solutions of the schrdinger equation with respect to the harmonic measure take the form @xmath168,\\ ] ] where @xmath169 is the so - called _ feynman  kac functional_. thus , we see that in order to calculate the radon  nikodym derivative we need to know the joint density of the feynman  kac functional and the brownian motion when the brownian motion hits the boundary @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath170 is constant , i.e. , we have either the yukawa equation or the helmholtz equation , then it is enough to know the joint distribution of the hitting time and place of the brownian motion on the boundary @xmath13 .",
    "these distributions are well - studied , see e.g. @xcite , but few joint distributions involving the feynman  kac functionals are known .        in the case of the other important special case of the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) , helmholtz equation , @xmath171 there is a recent result by chen et al .",
    "@xcite that provides the duffin correspondence .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that our results can be extended to the helmholtz equation for domains that are small enough with respect to the creation parameter @xmath19 so that the associated feynman ",
    "kac functional is finite : @xmath172 < \\infty.\\ ] ]        let @xmath173 be the @xmath21-dimensional unit ball .",
    "the harmonic measure has a nice tractable formula for ( unit ) balls : @xmath174 to have a tractable formula for the panharmonic measures on balls we need a tractable formula for the exit time and place distribution @xmath175.\\ ] ] there is a formula for this joint distribution due to hsu @xcite .",
    "the formula is rather complicated , so the calculations for the panharmonic measures @xmath176 may turn out to be rather demanding and it is unclear if a tractable formula can be found .",
    "the kelvin transformation is @xmath177(x ) = |x|^{2-n}u(x^*),\\ ] ] where @xmath178 the kelvin transformation preserves the harmonic functions and it can be used , e.g. , to calculate harmonic measures for balls from the harmonic measures for half - spaces , and vice versa .",
    "theorem [ thm : kakutani ] , corollary [ cor : yukawa - killing ] and corollary [ cor : yukawa - escaping ] give three different ways to simulate the panharmonic measures .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate their relative strengths and weaknesses in different domains ( where explicit tractable formulas are difficult or impossible to obtain ) .",
    "also , in the simulations one would like to use importance sampling in order to have more brownian paths in the target set in the boundary , and thus speeding up the convergence of the simulation . to use importance sampling in the three different simulation schemes provided by theorem [ thm : kakutani ] , corollary [ cor : yukawa - killing ] and corollary [ cor : yukawa - escaping ] , respectively , one must have a girsanov - type theorem for the killed , discounted and escaping brownian motion , respectively .",
    "this in turn would involve knowing the hitting time and place distribution of a brownian motion with drift , which is studied e.g. in yin and wang @xcite ."
