    "the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) created in heavy - ion collisions has been under intense study . in particular , it has been shown to exhibit almost perfect liquid collective behaviour .",
    "the extraction of one of its transport coefficients , the specific shear viscosity @xmath4 , has recently become one of the hottest topics .",
    "shear viscosity reduces the conversion efficiency from initial geometry deformation to final flow anisotropies , and in @xcite we reported that the eccentricity - scaled second and third order harmonic flow coefficients , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for unidentified charged hadrons are good choices to extract @xmath4 . for @xmath0",
    "this has already been done by several groups , but it was shown that this leaves a large uncertainty for @xmath4 due to ambiguities in the initial fireball deformation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we here show that a simultaneous analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can resolve this ambiguity .",
    "the authors of @xcite use a `` single - shot '' hydrodynamic approach which evolves a smooth initial profile obtained by averaging over an ensemble of fluctuating bumpy initial conditions .",
    "we here address the question if it matters whether one instead follows nature s example and evolves each bumpy initial condition separately ( `` event - by - event hydrodynamics '' ) , averaging over the fluctuating event ensemble only at the end . due to the high numerical cost of the event - by - event approach on the one hand and the strong sensitivity of @xmath4 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the other hand this issue is of high practical relevance .",
    "we initialize the hydrodynamic simulations by generating fluctuating initial entropy density profiles from the monte carlo glauber ( mc - glb . ) and monte carlo kln ( mc - kln ) models for au+au collisions at @xmath5gev ( see @xcite for details ) .    ,",

    "solid and dashed lines show results from single - shot and event - by - event hydrodynamics , respectively , for mc - kln initial conditions . the left panels ( a , c ) assume ideal @xcite , the right panels ( b , d ) viscous fluid dynamic evolution with @xmath7 .",

    "[ fig:1 ] we compare the eccentricity - scaled elliptic and triangular flow coefficients for thermal pions , kaons and protons ( i.e. without resonance decay contributions ) from single - shot and event - by - event hydrodynamics , for ideal and viscous fluids . for the single - shot simulations , we average over the event ensemble in the participant plane , i.e. after centering and rotating each event by the participant plane angle @xmath8 between the short axis of the second resp .",
    "third order harmonic component of its energy density profile @xmath9 and the impact parameter @xmath10 @xcite , before starting the evolution .",
    "for an ideal fluid ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a , c ) ) event - by - event hydrodynamics produces significantly less elliptic and slightly less triangular flow than the equivalent single - shot evolution .",
    "the difference in @xmath0 is smallest for pions ( @xmath11 ) but increases with hadron mass to about 10% for protons .",
    "for @xmath1 the differences are smaller , but again increase with hadron mass .",
    "in contrast , viscous hydrodynamics with @xmath7 produces almost the same @xmath0 and @xmath1 for single - shot and event - by - event hydro , irrespective of hadron mass ; if anything , the flows are now a little larger when the fluctuating events are evolved individually .",
    "apparently , shear viscosity quickly damps the initial density fluctuations into something approaching the smooth ensemble - averaged profile before most of the flow develops .",
    "( the strange pattern seen at very large impact parameters in figs .",
    "[ fig:1](b , d ) signals a jump of the flow angle @xmath12 @xcite by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 . )",
    "[ fig:1 ] suggests that for a viscous fluid with sufficiently large viscosity @xmath4 single - shot hydrodynamics can substitute for event - by - event evolution for the calculation of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 for unidentified and identified hadrons .",
    "for an ideal fluid this remains true for the triangular flow of unidentified charged hadrons ( which are mostly pions ) but not for that of identified heavy hadrons ( e.g. protons ) , nor for the elliptic flow @xmath0 .",
    "until the qgp viscosity is known , it is therefore advisable to extract it from event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "if it turns out large enough , additional systematic studies can be done using the more economic single - shot approach .    by comparing the left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we see that @xmath7 suppresses @xmath1 much more strongly ( by @xmath15 ) than @xmath0 ( which is suppressed only by @xmath16 ) .",
    "taken together , @xmath0 and @xmath1 thus over - constrain @xmath4 for a given model of initial state eccentricities @xmath17 .",
    "we will now show how this allows to distinguish experimentally between the mc - glauber and mc - kln models .",
    "we reported in @xcite that the mc - glauber and mc - kln models have similar @xmath18 but the mc - kln model has @xmath19 larger @xmath20 , and that for ideal fluid dynamics they give similar @xmath0 and @xmath1 ratios .",
    "accordingly , for ideal fluids the two models generate similar @xmath3 but different @xmath2 .",
    "we expect the ratios @xmath0 and @xmath1 for these two models to remain similar even when adding viscosity ( a corresponding study is ongoing )",
    ". therefore , for any fixed @xmath4 , they will generate similar @xmath3 but different @xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , when using different @xmath4 for the two models so that they produce the same @xmath2 , they will necessarily generate different @xmath3",
    ". they will therefore not be able to simultaneously describe a given set of experimental @xmath2 and @xmath3 data with the same medium properties .    to verify this statement quantitatively",
    "requires a proper event - by - event hydrodynmical calculation which is in progress .",
    "we here show instead results from a proof - of - concept calculation that supports our argument .",
    "we first generate a large set of deformed gaussian initial conditions similar to the ones described in @xcite , but having both non - zero @xmath20 and @xmath18 , as calculated from the mc - glauber and mc - kln models for the 20 - 30% centrality bin , with random relative orientation @xmath21 .",
    "we call these initial conditions `` mc - glauber - like '' and `` mc - kln - like '' .",
    "( left ) and @xmath22 ( right ) from viscous hydrodynamics using mc - glauber - like and mc - kln - like initial conditions and different values for @xmath4 ( see text for discussion ) .",
    "[ fig:3],title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left ) and @xmath22 ( right ) from viscous hydrodynamics using mc - glauber - like and mc - kln - like initial conditions and different values for @xmath4 ( see text for discussion ) .",
    "[ fig:3],title=\"fig : \" ]    fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows differential @xmath23 curves resulting from the viscous hydrodynamic evolution of these initial conditions .",
    "the solid and dashed curves in the left panel show that , in order to obtain the same @xmath24 for mc - kln - like and mc - glauber like initial conditions , the fluid must be twice as viscous for the former than for the latter .",
    "the right panel shows that , with @xmath4 chosen to produce the same @xmath2 , mc - glauber - like and mc - kln - like initial conditions produce dramatically different @xmath3 , with the one from mc - kln - like initialization being much smaller .",
    "conversely , if @xmath4 is tuned to produce the same @xmath3 , mc - glauber - like and mc - kln - like initial conditions require the same value of @xmath4 ( solid and dash - dotted lines in the right panel ) , which then leads to dramatically different @xmath2 values for the different initial conditions ( see corresponding lines in the left panel ) .",
    "these conclusions agree qualitatively with corresponding statements made in refs .",
    "we demonstrated that for sufficiently large viscosity ( @xmath25 ) and limited precision requirements single - shot evolution of smooth averaged initial profiles can substitute for event - by - event evolution of fluctuating initial conditions , and that a simultaneous analysis of @xmath2 and @xmath3 overconstrains @xmath4 and thus has the power to discriminate between initial state models . a precise extraction of @xmath4 without initial state ambiguity will , however , require event - by - event viscous hydrodynamical evolution of fluctuating initial states , coupled to a microscopic hadronic cascade for the freeze - out stage @xcite , to calculate ensemble averages of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
