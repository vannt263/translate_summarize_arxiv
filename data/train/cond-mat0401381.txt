    "<S> the mean field vortex phase diagram of a quasi two dimensional superconductor with a nodal @xmath0-wave pairing and with strong pauli spin depairing is studied in the parallel field case in order to examine an effect of gap nodes on the stability of a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo)-like vortex lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we find through a heuristic argument and a model calculation with a four - fold anisotropic fermi surface that the fflo - like state is relatively suppressed as the field approaches a nodal direction . </S>",
    "<S> when taking account of a couple of experimental results altogether , the present result strongly suggests that the pairing symmetry of cecoin@xmath1 should be of @xmath2-type .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    in a recent paper @xcite ( denoted as i hereafter ) , we have examined the vortex phase diagram of quasi two - dimensional ( q2d ) type ii superconductors with strong pauli paramagnetic ( spin ) depairing by focusing on @xmath3 case with a field @xmath4 perpendicular to the superconducting layers . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to earlier works @xcite taking account of both the orbital and spin depairing effects of the magnetic field in clean limit , the orbital depairing has been incorporated fully and _ nonperturbatively _ there @xcite , and two new results opposite to those suggested previously @xcite were found . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the mean field ( mf ) transition at the @xmath5-line changes from the familiar second - order one to a first - order ( mf - fot ) @xcite one at a _ higher _ temperature @xmath6 than a region in which a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo)-like @xcite modulated _ vortex lattice _ may appear . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is consistent with data of cecoin@xmath1 in @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second of all , a _ second order _ </S>",
    "<S> transition curve @xmath7 between such a fflo - like and ordinary vortex lattices remarkably _ decreases _ upon cooling . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these two results are also consistent with more recent data of cecoin@xmath1 , suggesting a structural transition to a fflo state , in @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a recent ultrasound measurement @xcite also shows that the suggested fflo state is , as we have argued in i , a kind of vortex lattice . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be further examined theoretically whether this qualitative agreement with the data in @xmath8 is justified or not .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> results of an application of analysis in i to a model for the @xmath8 case are reported . by including the contributions , neglected in previous works @xcite , from the nongaussian ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) terms of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy to the spatial gradient parallel to @xmath4 , where @xmath11 is the pair - field </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the relative position between @xmath6 and @xmath12-line is qualitatively the same as in @xmath3 case @xcite as far as a spin depairing strength realistic in bulk superconductors is used , and that , at least close to @xmath12 , the lo state @xcite with periodic nodal planes perpendicular to @xmath4 of @xmath13 is more stable than the ff state @xcite composed of a phase - modulation with keeping @xmath13 fixed .    </S>",
    "<S> a special attention is paid in this paper to a noticeable in - plane angular dependence of the fflo curve @xmath7 found in specific heat @xcite and magnetization @xcite data of cecoin@xmath1 : the observed fflo curve in @xmath14 [ 110 ] lies at higher temperatures than that in @xmath14 [ 100 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath12-anisotropy is much more remakable @xcite than that of @xmath5 and may give a decisive information on the four - fold anisotropy of the gap function . </S>",
    "<S> as far as an _ in - plane _ fermi velocity anisotropy is negligible , it is heuristically predicted through the following simple argument how a gap anisotropy results in a @xmath12-anisotropy : near the gap nodes where the superconducting gap @xmath15 is small , the coherence length @xmath16 defined locally in the @xmath17-space is longer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an orbital limiting field @xmath18 is inversely proportional to the square of an averaged coherence length in the plane perpendicular to @xmath4 and hence , is minimal when @xmath4 is directed along the four - fold symmetric gap nodes ( or minima ) . since a higher @xmath19 will lead to a relatively stronger effect of spin depairing , the fflo curve and @xmath6 , induced by the spin depairing , </S>",
    "<S> are expected to lie at higher temperatures as @xmath4 is located along a gap maximum . if comparing the expected @xmath12-anisotropy with the observations @xcite in cecoin@xmath1 , we inevitably reach the conclusion that , in agreement not with the original argument @xcite favoring a @xmath20-pairing just like in high-@xmath21 cuprates but with a recent report on low @xmath22 specific heat data @xcite , a node ( or a minimum ) of the gap function of cecoin@xmath1 is located along the [ 100]-direction , implying a @xmath2-pairing state . </S>",
    "<S> below , we will show how this conclusion is reinforced through a microscopic derivation of @xmath7 taking account of a possible in - plane four - fold anisotropy of the fermi surface ( fs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the present result might require a serious change in the picture on the pairing mechanism of cecoin@xmath1 based upon similarities on the normal state properties , including the presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuation , to the high @xmath21 cuprates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> first , let us sketch the outline of mf analysis @xcite for @xmath3 . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath23 and the @xmath0-wave gap function @xmath24 or @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the azimuthal angle in the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane . within the lowest ( @xmath29 ) landau level ( ll ) , </S>",
    "<S> the gl free energy density in the mf approximation takes the form @xmath30   </S>",
    "<S> \\simeq c_0 + c_2 q^2 + c_4 q^4 . </S>",
    "<S> \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the essential part of the mf analysis in i is to derive the coefficients , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 by starting from the weak - coupling bcs model with a zeeman ( pauli - paramagnetic ) term . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath36 is an averaged density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , and @xmath37 is the spatial average on @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 was expanded in terms of the lls as @xmath40 , and the higher lls were neglected above . for the lo ( ff ) </S>",
    "<S> state , @xmath41 takes the form @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a q2d fs with a circular form in @xmath38-@xmath39 plane was assumed , although an in - plane anisotropy will be conveniently included as @xmath26-dependences of the fermi velocity and dos ( see eq.(5 ) below ) . </S>",
    "<S> for an example , @xmath44 is , after performing @xmath17-integrals and introducing a parameter integral , expressed by @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the spatial average on @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the zeeman energy , and @xmath49 is the dimensionless pairing interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath50 has the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the magnetic length , and @xmath53 the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the extension , @xmath54 , of @xmath31 to the @xmath55-th ll is given by multiplying eq.(3 ) by @xmath56 , if keeping just terms diagonal with respect to the lls , where @xmath57 the @xmath55-th laguerre polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 are derived in a similar manner to above . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 arise from the @xmath60-dependences of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> the onset @xmath6 of mf - fot at @xmath61 is determined by @xmath62 irrespective of the details of higher order nongaussian terms of the gl free energy , while @xmath7 is defined by @xmath63 under the condition @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that the latter condition is always satisfied throughout the computations in the present work , so that the resulting @xmath7 is a second order transition line . </S>",
    "<S> if the effective strength of spin depairing @xmath65 is of order unity or larger , a phase diagram derived numerically in this manner includes a @xmath7-line decreasing upon cooling , where @xmath48 is the zeeman energy , and @xmath66 is the orbital limiting field in 2d limit . in ref.1 where the @xmath32 and @xmath33-contributions to @xmath34 were neglected , </S>",
    "<S> the lo and ff states had the same @xmath12-line , while we find that the instability of the straight vortex lattice into the lo vortex state @xcite occurs at a slightly higher tempeature than that into the ff state @xcite . hence , </S>",
    "<S> at least close to @xmath7 , the lo state becomes the ground state in @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> further , we find that the @xmath33-contribution to @xmath34 is quantitatively negligible , while the @xmath12-line is pushed by the corresponding @xmath32-contribution down to a lower temperature region in which @xmath61 and the vortex state just below it are described by the @xmath68 ll . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at least within the weak - coupling bcs model , a fflo state in @xmath3 rarely occurs because such a @xmath68 ll vortex lattice has no fflo - like modulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we guess that a slight specific heat anomaly @xcite in cecoin@xmath1 in @xmath3 at low enough temperatures may be rather due to a transition between straight vortex lattices in @xmath29 and @xmath68 lls . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study of this transition into a @xmath68 ll state will be reported elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> now , let us turn to the @xmath8 case . </S>",
    "<S> although , in principle , the above analysis can be extended to a q2d system with a cylindrical fs under @xmath4 perpendicular to the cylindrical axis , we have chosen to work in an elliptic fs elongated along @xmath39(@xmath69)-axis and with the dispersion relation @xmath70 under @xmath71 in order to make numerical calculations more tractable , where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 with @xmath74 and a constant @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the case with a moderately large @xmath76-value to _ qualitatively _ describe essential features in the realistic q2d case . by isotropize the @xmath17 vector as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the unit vector in the spherical coordinate , the velocity @xmath79 on fs is written as @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> a jacobian @xmath81 accompanying the angular integral along fs is exactly cancelled by the angular dependence of dos @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> again , the _ in - plane _ ( four - fold ) anisotropy of fs will be first neglected . </S>",
    "<S> then , the gl free energy within @xmath29 ll takes the form of eq.(1 ) , and the function @xmath83 appearing in @xmath44 ( see eq.(3 ) ) is replaced in the present case by @xmath84    [ 0.45]-@xmath85 mean field phase diagram obtained using @xmath86 and with no in - plane fs anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the transition or crossover positions in @xmath87 gap - maximum ( @xmath88 gap - node or minimum ) are expressed by the solid curves and filled circle ( chain curves and open circle ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted curve and open triangle denote , respectively , the mf - fot line and the position at which the two solid curves @xmath89 in @xmath29 and @xmath90 merge with each other.,title=\"fig : \" ]    where @xmath91 . the parameter @xmath92 is insensitive to the uniaxial anisotropy @xmath76 but dependent on @xmath85 and needs to be determined by maximizing @xmath5 . by focusing on the low @xmath85 region , </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath92 takes a value between 0.4 and 0.5 depending on the relative angle between @xmath4 and a nearest nodal direction . using this parameter , the anisotropy in spatial variations of @xmath11 within the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane is given by @xmath93 . except for modifications indicated above , the corresponding quartic and 6th order terms of the gl free energy are derived by closely following the analysis in i. we choose @xmath94 as a measure of the spin depairing strength in @xmath8 , where @xmath95 is the orbital limiting field in the isotropic case .    in fig.1 , the resulting phase diagram is shown to illustrate how the @xmath7-position depend upon the relative angle between @xmath4 and the nodal directions . </S>",
    "<S> thin solid ( chain ) curves are defined by @xmath89 , and the @xmath5 in @xmath96 in each case is given by each @xmath97 line . in agreement with the heuristic argument given earlier , @xmath7 and @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> are shifted to higher temperatures as the in - plane field is directed along a gap - maximum , reflecting an enhanced spin depairing in this field configuration . as in @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the fflo state at least close to @xmath12 has the lo - like variation . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified by combining our numerical calculations with an analytical calculation with the orbital depairing perturbatively included that such an in - plane @xmath12-anisotropy is absent without the orbital depairing ( i.e. , when @xmath98 ) and _ monotonously _ increases with decreasing @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , it is not easy to properly predict the corresponding anisotropy ( in - plane angular dependence ) of @xmath5-curve : first , the depression of @xmath61 due to the spin depairing is larger as the corresponding @xmath18 is higher , and hence , the @xmath61-magnitude may not have a monotonous @xmath99-dependence . </S>",
    "<S> second , the mf - fot line of @xmath61 is directly determined by the details of the nongaussian terms other than the quartic one in gl free energy @xcite and hence , is quantitatively affected by our assumption of keeping the nongaussian terms only up to @xmath100 in eq.(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the rapid increase of mf - fot line on cooling _ just _ below @xmath6 arises due to an extremely small @xmath101 near @xmath6 and might flatten if we can numerically include the @xmath102 and higher order terms . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath33-contribution to @xmath34 ( i.e. , to @xmath7 ) was negligible , like in @xmath3 case , consistently with the smallness of @xmath101 mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the @xmath7 curve is less sensitive to the neglect of the @xmath102 and higher order gl terms . for these reasons , we will focus hereafter on @xmath6 and @xmath12 which directly measure the ( effective ) spin depairing strength . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting anisotropies of @xmath6 and @xmath12 in fig.1 qualitatively agree with those of cecoin@xmath1 in @xmath8 @xcite if a gap node ( or minimum ) is located along [ 100 ] . as already mentioned , the mf - fot line in @xmath29 ll needs to lie above the corresponding @xmath103 line in order for @xmath7 to be realized as a transition line . as fig.1 shows , this condition manages to be satisfied in contrast to the @xmath3 case .    in order to examine how the result in fig.1 is affected by the _ in - plane _ fs anisotropy , </S>",
    "<S> let us next introduce it as a fermi velocity anisotropy in a similar manner to ref.@xcite like @xmath104    [ 0.42 ] ) and ( b ) ( @xmath105 ) defined in the text.,title=\"fig : \" ]    where @xmath106 , accompanied by the replacement @xmath107 in any angular integral ( see eq.(4 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> except these replacements in our calculation , the derivation of phase diagrams is quite the same as that of fig.1 . when @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , the fermi velocity becomes maximal ( minimal ) along @xmath110 . by combining these two cases with the two candidates , @xmath111 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 , of @xmath112 , we have four different cases of the relative anisotropies under a fixed @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> we will classify them into two categories , ( a ) @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 with @xmath108 , and ( b ) @xmath113 with @xmath108 and @xmath115 with @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> this classification is motivated by the result @xcite that , in the category ( a ) , the fermi velocity anisotropy and the pairing anisotropy favor two different orientations , competing with each other , of the square vortex lattices to be realized in four - fold anisotropic @xmath0-wave superconductors in @xmath3 , while such a competition does not occur in ( b ) . in fig.2 , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase diagrams for the categories ( a ) and ( b ) are given . </S>",
    "<S> in the case ( a ) , the angular dependences of @xmath12 and @xmath6 are weakened by the fs anisotropy compared with those in fig.1 , while the opposite tendency is seen in the case ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be understood as follows by noting that the orbital depairing strength local in the @xmath17-space is measured in the present case by @xmath116 in eq.(4 ) ( note that , in 2d limit , @xmath117 is absent there ) . by focusing on the case with @xmath4 parallel to a gap node and noting @xmath118 in the integrand of eq.(4 ) , </S>",
    "<S> one will notice that a nonzero @xmath119 tends to increase ( decrease ) contributions of @xmath116 , on average , when @xmath114 ( @xmath108 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an enhanced orbital depairing in @xmath4 parallel to a node of the case ( b ) additionally reduces @xmath12 so that the difference between the two cases in fig.2 follows . bearing in mind the general character of this interpretation , we believe that the results in fig.2 are not qualitatively changed by a refinement of microscopic description .    </S>",
    "<S> the above results commonly show a @xmath7-line shifting to higher temperatures as the in - plane field approaches a gap - maximum and , compared with the data in cecoin@xmath1 @xcite , imply a @xmath2-state as the pairing state of this material . </S>",
    "<S> although one might consider a possibility of @xmath20-pairing based on the fact that an extremely strong fs anisotropy in the case ( a ) may reverse the anisotropies of @xmath6 and @xmath12 , such a strong fs anisotropy of the case ( a ) should result @xcite in a square vortex lattice with an orientation due to the fs anisotropy and hence , contradicts not only the specific heat data @xcite but the observed orientation @xcite of @xmath3 square vortex lattice . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an inclusion of fs anisotropy _ reinforces _ our conclusion favoring a @xmath2-pairing , although a moderate fs anisotropy competitive in @xmath3 with the gap anisotropy ( i.e. , of the case ( a ) ) is needed for quantitative understandings .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the mean field phase diagram of a type ii superconductor with strong pauli paramagnetic depairing and with a four - fold symmetric @xmath0-wave pairing was qualitatively studied in the parallel field case . </S>",
    "<S> the region in which the fflo vortex phase appears is enlarged when the in - plane field is directed along a gap - maximum . </S>",
    "<S> this result is reinforced by including in - plane fs anisotropies and strongly suggests a @xmath2 pairing as the best candidate of the gap function of cecoin@xmath1 in spite of the electronic similarities @xcite to that of high @xmath21 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> a reinterpretation of thermal conductivity data by izawa et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite can be seen in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present theory should be applicable to examining the pairing state of other materials , such as an organic material @xcite , showing a remarkable pauli paramagnetic depairing .    </S>",
