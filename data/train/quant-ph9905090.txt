    "new and interesting theoretical challenges are presently arising in atom and molecular optics , as we want to show here . the rapidly growing field of atom optics exploits wave - theoretical aspects of quantum - mechanical particles and their interference effects . for electrons and neutrons",
    "this has a long history , but for atoms it is more recent .",
    "advances in nanotechnology have made it possible to manufacture structures such as double slits and gratings with slit widths as small as 50 nm .",
    "typical optics experiments have been carried over to atoms .",
    "for example , atomic beams have been sent through a double slit and diffraction patterns were observed @xcite .",
    "similar experiments have been performed with transmission gratings and large numbers of diffraction peaks were observed with high resolution @xcite .    in such experiments",
    "the incoming atoms usually can be described by plane waves which are associated with quantum - mechanical point particles .",
    "classical optics with its standard wave - theoretical methods and approximations , in particular those of huygens and kirchhoff , has been successfully applied to atom optics and has yielded good agreement with experiments .",
    "interesting problems with this simple picture have , however , appeared quite recently .",
    "one complication arises in the diffraction of molecules , in particular of weakly bound systems .",
    "when a diffracted system is observed at a nonzero angle from the incident direction , then the system has received a momentum transfer from the grating . for a weakly bound system this may induce breakup processes and result in a change of the diffraction pattern . moreover , weakly bound systems are large compared to atoms , and treatment as point particles may no longer be adequate .",
    "in addition , low - lying molecular rotational or vibrational states may be excited by the passage through the grating , and this may also change the diffraction pattern . as a further complication , surface potentials resulting from van der waals forces have been seen to change diffraction patterns @xcite .    experimentally , molecular diffraction has been observed for he@xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite and for na@xmath0 in ref .",
    "the molecule na@xmath0 is tightly bound and very small compared to present - day slit widths , and the results seem to be describable by classical wave - optics .",
    "the recently discovered helium dimer he@xmath0 @xcite , however , is extremely weakly bound ( @xmath10.11 @xmath2ev ) and quite large , with an estimated diameter of about 6 nm @xcite . for a slit width of 50 nm this considerable size of the molecule has some effect on the diffraction pattern , and this effect will increase for future smaller slit widths .",
    "we have performed a theoretical analysis of diffraction of weakly bound diatomic systems by a transmission grating @xcite . the main point which we wish",
    "to stress in this article is that _ diffraction _ by a transmission grating really means _ scattering _ by the grating bars .",
    "therefore , since breakup processes and finite - size effects are to be included , the proper approach is to consider quantum mechanical scattering of composite systems by an external potential , @xmath3 say . for the beam velocities used in experiments the electronic degrees of the two atoms can be neglected , and thus one deals with a system of two particles , bound by a potential , denoted by @xmath4 . due to",
    "the presence of the external potential @xmath3 resulting from the grating bars ( `` walls '' ) the problem is quite different from one - particle scattering and rather resembles , at least mathematically , the three - body problem where , loosely speaking , the external potential plays the role of a third body .",
    "not surprisingly one can therefore adapt methods of few - body theory to the present problem , in particular the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite which are related to the faddeev equations . in section 2",
    "we briefly outline how one can adapt this to the problem at hand , and we obtain ags equations for the scattering amplitude of a bound two - particle system by an external potential .",
    "these equations decouple here and can be iterated in a straightforward way . in section 3",
    "we indicate how the lowest order can be specialized to diffraction scattering by a transmission grating with a short - range strongly repulsive ( `` reflective '' ) bar potential .",
    "our results are illustrated for he@xmath0 . at the end",
    "we will discuss the role of weakly attractive surface potentials and how they can be incorporated .",
    "in this section the quantum mechanical scattering problem of a bound two - particle system ( molecule ) by a quite general obstacle will be considered .",
    "the latter is described by an external potential of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the position of the respective atomic constituent and @xmath7 the respective single - atom potential .",
    "the binding potential is denoted by @xmath8 , with negative binding energies @xmath9 and two - particle bound states @xmath10 , where the potentials @xmath4 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are assumed to be of short range . among all possible scattering channels in the following only those will be considered in which the molecule is elastically scattered or changes its internal bound state .",
    "the plane - wave scattering matrix element for an incoming molecule with momentum @xmath13 and internal state @xmath14 and an outgoing molecule with momentum @xmath15 and internal state @xmath16 reads @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the molecular mass .",
    "the transition amplitudes @xmath19 determine the molecular diffraction pattern and can be calculated by adapting the ags @xcite approach as follows . introducing the green s operators @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the sixdimensional free hamiltonian ( kinetic energy ) of two particles , the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined by the relations @xmath24 as in ref .  @xcite it can be shown that @xmath25 is directly related to the scattering matrix eq .",
    "( [ smatrix ] ) through @xmath26 the resolvent equation @xmath27 , applied to the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ transopuvv ] ) , gives @xmath28 and eq .",
    "( [ transopuwv ] ) inserted into the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ags1 ] ) gives @xmath29 we introduce the @xmath30 matrix @xmath31 , which satisfies @xmath32 eq .",
    "( [ ags2 ] ) can then be written as @xmath33 in a similar way a second ags - like equation is obtained as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , in analogy to @xmath36 .",
    "once iterated eqs .",
    "( [ agsi ] ) and ( [ agsii ] ) decouple and give @xmath37 although eq .",
    "( [ agsresult ] ) explicitly determines only the transition operator for elastic and excitation processes , @xmath22 , all channels are implicitly included .",
    "similar to eq .",
    "( [ transamptransop ] ) it can further be shown that @xmath38 is the transition operator for a molecular break - up into two asymptotically free particles .",
    "( [ agsresult ] ) is exact and contains both breakup and finite - size effects .",
    "it lends itself to iteration , and to lowest order in @xmath39 one has @xmath40 by eq .",
    "( [ transamptransop ] ) this gives @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "although @xmath36 is the transition operator for scattering of two asymptotically free particles by the external potential @xmath3 it is not on the energy shell in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "the interaction @xmath4 is taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) through the wave - functions @xmath16 and @xmath14 .",
    "although the potential @xmath43 is additive in the two particles and looks very simple , eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) is not straightforward to evaluate since the green s operator @xmath44 is not easily expressed by one - particle green s operators . in the diffraction domain the de broglie wavelength is small compared to the extension of the obstacle and the potential . to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) for small scattering angles one obtains an integral expansion of eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) by inserting two complete sets of two - particle plane waves , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , on the right - hand - side .",
    "the kinetic energies of these states are not equal to @xmath47 ( i.e. @xmath36 is not on the energy shell ) .",
    "however , the momentum space wave - functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are centered at relative momenta @xmath50 which are small compared to @xmath51 , and this fact can be used to show that in @xmath52 one can replace @xmath47 by @xmath53 , where , for simplicity , the atomic constituents are assumed to have the same mass , @xmath54 .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation for the potential @xmath3 further enables one to reduce eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) to one - particle transition amplitudes for the potentials @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for reflecting bars these can be calculated by standard methods .",
    "if the bar and slit widths are much larger than the diameter of the two - particle system , then the one - particle amplitudes are sharply peaked at the forward direction on a scale on which the other expressions appearing in the integral expansion of eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) are slowly varying and can therefore be dropped .",
    "this then leads to the usual diffraction pattern of a point particle of mass 2@xmath55 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : a25molwire ] we have plotted @xmath66 for he@xmath0 and the corresponding quantity for a point particle .",
    "the bar width is 25 nm . for a symmetric grating of period 50",
    "nm the vertical lines in the inset indicate where the peaks of the grating functions cut out the diffraction peaks of first order , second order and so on . for a symmetric grating and point particles",
    "there are no even - order diffraction peaks since the single - bar amplitude vanishes there , as seen in the inset . for the dimer",
    "this is not true , and it therefore has small even - order peaks which become more pronounced for smaller bar and slit widths .    intuitively we expect that finite - size effects of he@xmath0 might be partially taken into account by a larger bar and smaller slit width .",
    "[ fig : a25ekum ] shows that the single - bar amplitude of he@xmath0 , for a bar width of 25 nm , can be approximated for small lateral momentum transfer by that of a point particle for bar width of ( 25 + 2.8 ) nm . for",
    "a grating this would mean a nonsymmetric grating of correspondingly smaller slit width .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath67 for the ground - state wave - function of he@xmath0 we are using is just 2.8 nm .",
    "when a rare - gas atom such as helium passes through a slit it experiences a repulsive potential of very short range .",
    "however , if the atom is polarizable there will also be a longer - range attractive surface potential acting on it , due to van der waals forces .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have shown that this additional attractive potential can have an unexpectedly large influence on the diffraction pattern , not so much so for helium but rather for the heavier rare - gas atoms , which have a higher polarizability .",
    "the attractive part of the surface potential , denoted by @xmath68 , is of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the distance of the atom from the slit surface and where @xmath71 is a constant depending on the grating material and the particular rare - gas atom .    in a first step we have taken @xmath68 into account for the atomic case , with quite an unexpected and surprising result .",
    "the simple picture of the grating given in fig .  [ fig : grating ] as an array of rectangular bars is not adequate if the surface potential plays a role .",
    "in fact , with the simple geometry of fig .  [",
    "fig : grating ] our results did not even qualitatively agree with early experiments for heavier rare - gas atoms . as it then turned out",
    ", the etching process produces bars whose cross section is not quite rectangular but rather trapeze - like as in fig .",
    "[ fig : wedge ] , with a small angle @xmath72 of about @xmath73 off the perpendicular direction .",
    "this seems to be a small deviation from the idealized rectangular form of fig .",
    "[ fig : grating ] , but taking the angle @xmath72 into account gave at least qualitative agreement .",
    "in the mean time the approach , both experimentally and theoretically , has been so perfected , that it has been possible to determine both the grating parameters as well as the surface potential constant @xmath71 from experimental data @xcite .    for dimers",
    "the surface potential can be taken into account by adding @xmath74 and @xmath75 to @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) .",
    "the details are presently being worked out .",
    "we have shown in this article that new and interesting theoretical questions arise in atom optics when the spatial extent of a diffracted system can no longer be ignored and when possible excitation energies become comparable to the kinetic energy of diffracted systems .",
    "here we have studied the diffraction of a weakly bound two - particle system by an obstacle , in particular by a transmission grating .",
    "we have obtained an analytic expression for the elastic diffraction amplitude which incorporates breakup processes and finite - size effects .",
    "this expression contains the familiar grating function of classical optics as a factor and this puts the diffraction peaks at the angles expected from classical wave theory . this grating function",
    "is multiplied by the molecular diffraction amplitude of a single grating bar , and in this factor a difference from the point - particle case may arise .    for a molecular diameter very small compared to the bar and slit widths",
    "the derivations from the point - particle result are indeed negligible , as expected .",
    "this is no longer true for smaller bar and slit widths . in particular",
    ", heights of diffraction peaks may become lower than for point - particles .",
    "this can be attributed to breakups that diminish the actual number of molecules in a given direction .",
    "moreover , the decrease in peak height goes with the diffraction angle and thus with the lateral momentum transfer , which is quite reasonable since higher momentum transfer should imply more breakups .",
    "in addition , diffraction orders that are suppressed to zero for point particles and for symmetric gratings may reappear .",
    "the appearance of the diffraction peaks at the wave - theoretical locations for gratings holds quite generally , also for larger composite systems . for dimers a simplified argument has been given by us in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the general case will be treated elsewhere .",
