    "this paper addresses a question of j. przytycki .",
    "when defining the hochschild homology of an algebra with coefficients in a bimodule , the differential displays a certain cyclical feature which makes it sometimes convenient to write the tensor factors of @xmath2-chain generators , not linearly , but instead as the vertices of an @xmath3-sided polygon .",
    "przytycki has a beautiful interpretation of this appearance of @xmath2-gons in terms of the chromatic homology of graphs developed by of helme - guizon and rong ( @xcite ) : a variant of this theory constructed using an algebra @xmath0 and an @xmath1-bimodule @xmath4 applied to the @xmath2-gon is the hochschild homology of @xmath0 with coefficients in @xmath4 through a range of dimensions increasing with @xmath2 . in general chromatic homology of a graph",
    "is only defined when the algebra is commutative , but in the case of the @xmath2-gon or a line graph , the non - commutative case also makes sense . in speculating about possible generalisations of hochschild homology in @xcite przytycki",
    "writes that he believes `` graph homology is the proper generalization of hochschild homology : from a polygon to any graph '' . the remaining problem being , however , that one does not know in general how to define chromatic graph homology involving non - commutative algebras . to paraphrase , przytycki s question is :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given a ( possibly non - commutative ) algebra @xmath0 and an @xmath1 bimodule @xmath4 , can one construct a functor from some category of graphs to graded modules such that on @xmath2-gons this functor agrees with hochschild homology through a range of dimensions ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in this paper we consider finite based directed graphs , that is digraphs whose vertex set is finite and for which there is a distinguished vertex , the _",

    "there are two key ideas necessary to embrace non - commutative algebras : firstly one must give up on having `` cube '' ( as seen in the construction of chromatic graph homology ) and secondly one needs directed edges in order to be able to multiply non - commuting elements ( the head and tail providing information on which element comes first ) .",
    "the base vertex is necessitated by the appearance of the bimodule @xmath4 . in order to obtain a functor",
    "it is essential that we use the approach initiated in @xcite relating khovanov - type homology to the homology of posets with coefficients in a presheaf .",
    "the construction goes roughly as follows .",
    "we replace a digraph @xmath6 by its poset of directed multipaths @xmath9 and then define the homology groups @xmath10 as the homology of the poset @xmath9 with coefficients in an arbitrary coefficient system ( pre - sheaf ) @xmath11 .",

    "moreover the functor @xmath13 constructed on @xmath9 agrees with the ( implicit ) functor used in the construction of @xmath199 in this case . since the graph is a polygon , the only partial derivative in przytycki s set - up that are set to zero are those from corank @xmath148 elements to the maximal element and this corresponds to the absence of the maximum element of the boolean lattice in @xmath9 .",
    "it now follows from the main result of @xcite that the homology of the path category of category @xmath198 with coefficients in @xmath13 is isomorphic to @xmath200 with a grading shift : @xmath201 combining this with przytycki s result gives the desired isomorphism .    when @xmath21 the base vertex become irrelevant and we may define for an ( unbased ) digraph @xmath6 the homology groups @xmath202 , where on the right - hand side any base vertex for @xmath6 will do . letting @xmath203 denote the category of @xmath7-algebras we have :    [ thm : restricted ] @xmath204 is a bifunctor .",

    "we can therefore define a homomorphism @xmath207 by @xmath208 .",

    "composition of algebra homomorphisms is easily seen to give a well defined composition of these induced maps .",
    "if one fixes the directed graph @xmath6 the above gives a functor @xmath212 one is tempted to call @xmath213 the _ homology of the algebra @xmath0 with coefficients in the digraph @xmath6_. such homology theories of algebras are probably worthy of study in their own right .",
    "we limit ourselves here to the observation that if @xmath214 is an oriented cycle of length @xmath2 in @xmath6 then there is an inclusion of digraphs @xmath215 which by functoriality and theorem [ thm : main ] gives a map @xmath216 for @xmath217 ."
