    "let @xmath0 be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension @xmath4 and let @xmath5 be its complex cohomology . since the fundamental paper @xcite , it has been known that the algebra structure , induced by the cup product , determines the rational homotopy of @xmath6 we consider the exterior algebra @xmath7 and the natural homomorphism @xmath8 which can be seen as the algebra homomorphism induced from the albanese map @xmath9 it follows that @xmath10 is a graded @xmath11-module .",
    "this structure also provides important information on the topology of @xmath0 . a basic result in this direction ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite )",
    "is that the nilpotent completion of the fundamental group @xmath12 is determined by @xmath13 and by the homomorphism @xmath14    in particular if @xmath15 is not trivial , then @xmath12 is not abelian .",
    "examples of varieties with non - trivial nilpotent towers were found by sommese - van de ven @xcite and by campana @xcite . in these examples",
    "the non - trivial elements in @xmath16 all come from the @xmath17-part of @xmath18 in the hodge decomposition @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper we focus instead on the holomorphic part of @xmath20 .",

    "the importance of these structures has been emphasized recently by lazarsfeld and popa in @xcite , where generic vanishing is applied to the setting of the bgg correspondence .    a classical result relating the kernel of @xmath27 to the topology of @xmath0 is the castelnuovo - de franchis theorem ( cf .",
    "* proposition x.9 ) ) .",
    "it states that the existence of @xmath28 such that @xmath29 is equivalent to the existence of a surjective morphism from @xmath0 to a curve of genus @xmath30 .",
    "we note that in this case the fundamental group of @xmath0 surjects onto the fundamental group of the base curve ; hence it has an infinite nilpotent tower , in line with the above mentioned results .",
    "the castelnuovo - de franchis theorem has been generalized to the case of decomposable elements in @xmath31 for arbitrary @xmath32 by catanese @xcite .",
    "apart from the decomposable case , the most important setting where non - trivial elements appear in @xmath33 is when @xmath0 has a lagrangian structure .",
    "we will say that an @xmath4-dimensional variety @xmath0 is _ lagrangian _ if there exists a map of degree one @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an abelian variety of dimension @xmath36 , and a @xmath37-form @xmath38 of rank @xmath36 on @xmath35 such that @xmath39 . clearly , a lagrangian subvariety of an abelian variety is lagrangian .",
    "one expects that the existence of a lagrangian form gives strong restrictions on the geometry and the topology of a variety ; however , it turned out that even to construct examples of such varieties is a difficult task .    in @xcite bogomolov and tschinkel",
    "provide examples of surfaces which are lagrangian in their albanese variety , using dominant maps between k3 surfaces . in some cases",
    "they prove that these surfaces are not fibred over curves of genus @xmath3 .",
    "in @xcite a new topological consequence of the existence of a lagrangian form is proved ; namely , if @xmath0 is a lagrangian surface , under some assumption on the branch locus of the albanese map , the topological index @xmath40 is showed to be non - negative . moreover , the authors give another example of a surface with a lagrangian @xmath37-form not coming from a fibration ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 6.6 ) ) based on a previous article of the third author @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigate the map @xmath41 for a variety @xmath0 constructed as galois closure of a generically finite morphism @xmath42 ( or else a finite degree dominant rational map ) .",

    "we suppose that @xmath46 is irregular - i.e. @xmath47 - and that @xmath48 for some @xmath49 . by using representation theory",
    "we then detect a subspace of large dimension contained in @xmath50 .",
    "although the galois closures have been thoroughly studied by several authors ( see for instance the important papers @xcite and @xcite ) , this very simple and general application of the theory of galois covers is - to our knowledge - new .",

    "these surfaces are galois covers of a triple covering of an abelian surface on a rational one , so the existence of a non - trivial element in @xmath33 is guaranteed by theorem [ theorem main ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of the geometry of @xmath65 surfaces requires a lot of effort and the use of several different techniques . besides classical tools ( such as linear systems on curves , fibrations and double coverings on surfaces )",
    ", we exploit the theory of abelian surfaces and their moduli , and the monodromy of the torsion points .",
    "the starting point of our construction is an abelian surface @xmath66 provided of a line bundle @xmath67 inducing a polarization of type @xmath68 . using the fine analysis of @xmath68-polarized abelian surfaces contained in @xcite",
    ", we investigate the geometry of the linear pencil @xmath69 and of the induced fibration on @xmath70 relating the behavior of the special fibers to certain subsets of the torsion points of @xmath66 .",
    "we then define a degree three rational covering @xmath71 of the hirzebruch surface @xmath72 .",
    "we would like to note that the induced fibration has been studied also by xiao @xcite and by chen and tan in @xcite , whereas the map @xmath45 has been presented by tokunaga and yoshihara @xcite in order to provide examples of abelian surfaces with minimal degree of irrationality .",
    "we give an explicit geometric description of the galois closure of @xmath45 , and we define the @xmath65 surface @xmath0 to be its minimal desingularization .",
    "even though this construction could be carried on a birational setting , in order to control the geometry of @xmath0 and to compute its invariants , we need to resolve explicitly the indeterminacy locus of @xmath45 : it is then crucial the knowledge of the geometry of @xmath69 .",
    "we investigate the geometry of @xmath65 surfaces .",

    "[ theorem main ] let @xmath66 be an abelian surface with a line bundle @xmath67 of type @xmath68 such that all the curves in the pencil @xmath69 are irreducible",
    ". then there exists a rational triple covering @xmath73 of the hirzebruch surface @xmath74 .",
    "the minimal desingularization @xmath0 of the galois closure of @xmath45 is a surface of general type with invariants @xmath75 moreover , @xmath0 is lagrangian with albanese variety @xmath76 , and it does not have any fibration over curves of genus @xmath30 .",
    "we prove further that for a general choice of @xmath66 in the moduli space @xmath77 of @xmath68-polarized abelian surfaces , the galois closure of the covering @xmath45 is smooth and minimal , hence it is the @xmath65 surface itself .",
    "a crucial point here is the study of the monodromy of the points of order @xmath78 in @xmath79    in view of castelnuovo - de franchis theorem the @xmath65 surfaces are particularly interesting because the lagrangian structure does not come from a fibration over a curve of genus greater or equal to @xmath80 our proof of this fact is indirect and uses heavily the knowledge of special curves on the @xmath65 surface and the theory of complex abelian surfaces .",
    "it is worth noticing that the @xmath65 surfaces are so far the only examples of lagrangian surfaces non - fibred over curves of genus greater than @xmath81 whose invariants are explicitly computed .",
    "we see from theorem [ theorem main ] that the @xmath65 surfaces have negative topological index @xmath82 .",
    "this shows that the positivity of the index is not a property of lagrangian surface , thus disproving a conjecture stated in @xcite .",
    "the assumptions on the branch locus of the albanese map made in that paper , and in particular the connectedness , are then proved to be necessary . in section [ topological ]",
    "we make a detailed discussion on this topic .    from the non - triviality of @xmath16",
    "it follows straightforwardly that the nilpotent tower of the @xmath65 surfaces is not trivial up to the second step .",
    "the examples of campana and sommese - van der ven have precisely two steps . in @xcite ( the last paper of a series )",
    "amram , teicher and vishne study the galois closures of the generic projections from the product of two elliptic curves to @xmath83 . among other results , they prove that the nilpotent tower of the fundamental groups of these surfaces are non - trivial up to step @xmath78",
    ". it would be interesting to compute the class of nilpotency of the @xmath65 surfaces .. we determine the dimension of @xmath15 ( see proposition [ kerrho2 ] ) which is @xmath84 .",
    "this is a first step towards the computation of the nilpotent tower of @xmath12 , which is one of our next purposes .      in the first section we prove the general result described in theorem [ teo1 ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the construction and study of the @xmath65 surfaces . in the second section we recall some results on @xmath68-polarized abelian surfaces , and we establish a correspondence between bielliptic curves and these surfaces ( via generalized prym varieties ) . in section 3",
    "we consider the pencil defined by the polarization on one of these abelian surfaces @xmath66 , and we relate the geometry of special members to some subsets of torsion points on @xmath66 . we define in section 4 a triple covering from a blow up @xmath85 of @xmath66 to the hirzebruch surface @xmath72 , whose galois closure @xmath86 is constructed in section 5 .",
    "moreover , we prove that the branch locus @xmath87 is reduced with simple double singularities and we compute its numerical class . in section 6",
    "we then define @xmath65 surfaces and we compute their chern invariants .",
    "we determine their albanese varieties and prove that they are lagrangian . the seventh section is devoted to prove that the @xmath65 surfaces do not admit a fibration over curves of genus @xmath3 , and we study @xmath15 . in section 8 , via the monodromy of points of order @xmath78 , we prove that the galois closures associated to general abelian surfaces are smooth .",
