    "a large amount of work has been published so far , investigating the atomic structure through information - theoretic tools and statistical complexity measures @xcite .",
    "these information and statistical complexity measures are , in essence , functionals of the studied density distributions , and therefore in our case , functionals of the atomic density distributions ( probability distributions of electrons in atoms ) , in both momentum and position spaces .",
    "preliminary studies were focused separately in position and momentum space densities@xcite , while later the interest shifted to  total \" or  net \" information measures , attempting to merge the results of both spaces ( e.g. the sum of position and momentum spaces for the shannon information entropy , and the product of the corresponding results for the fisher information)@xcite .    in the present work we study separately various information and complexity measures in position and momentum spaces .",
    "of course the  total \" measures , in the sense described above , satisfy some tempting and often desirable properties , e.g. they are dimensionless , but from a physical point of view each space ( position and momentum ) carries different information about the atomic structure .",
    "so , it is worth to examine which of the above measures resembles more sensitively and accurately the periodicity of the atomic structure i.e. carries more information .",
    "thus , we present shannon information entropy , fisher information , and disequilibrium , together with lmc complexity and fisher - shannon plane , in both position and momentum spaces , as functions of the atomic number @xmath0",
    ". we also compare our results with experimental data i.e. atomic radius , first ionization potential , electronegativity , and atomic dipole polarizability .",
    "an attempt is made to connect the fisher information with ( e,2e ) experiments .",
    "the shannon information entropy @xcite in position space , @xmath1 , is defined as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the electron density distribution normalized to unity .",
    "the corresponding information entropy in momentum space , @xmath4 , is given by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the momentum density distribution normalized to unity . in position - space",
    ", @xmath1 determines the extent of electron delocalization , since a highly localized @xmath3 is associated with a diffuse @xmath6 , leading to low @xmath1 and high @xmath4 and vice versa .",
    "the net shannon information entropy takes the form    @xmath7    the fisher information @xcite in position , @xmath8 , is defined as    @xmath9    and the corresponding measure in momentum space is given by    @xmath10    the individual fisher measures are bounded through the cramer - rao inequality according to @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the corresponding spatial and momentum variances respectively . in position space ,",
    "fisher information measures the sharpness of probability density and for a gaussian distribution is exactly equal to the variance @xcite .",
    "a sharp and strongly localized probability density gives rise to a larger value of fisher information in position space .",
    "moreover , the fisher measure has the desirable properties , i.e. it is always positive and reflects the localization character of the probability distribution more sensitively than the shannon entropy @xcite .",
    "the net fisher information is defined by    @xmath15    fisher information is also intimately related to the shannon information entropy via de bruijn identity @xcite    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a random variable with a finite variance with a density @xmath18 , and @xmath19 an independent normally distributed random variable with zero mean and unit variance .    the disequilibrium ( also know as information  energy \" or onicescu information ) @xmath20 as defined in @xcite , for position and momentum spaces , is    @xmath21    while for the net disequilibrium @xmath22 we employ the definition    @xmath23    the statistical measure of complexity @xcite is defined by the formula    @xmath24    while the net lmc complexity takes the form    @xmath25    finally fisher - shannon plane @xcite in position and momentum space in d - dimensions is defined as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the corresponding net measure is given by    @xmath29    in the present work we consider accurate spin - independent atomic wave functions obtained by bunge et al .",
    "@xcite , by applying the roothaan - hartree - fock method ( rhf ) to calculate analytical self - consistent - field ( scf ) atomic wave functions . in this approach",
    "the radial atomic orbitals are expanded as a finite superposition of primitive radial functions    @xmath30    where the normalized primitive basis @xmath31 is taken as a slater - type orbital set    @xmath32    the normalization factor @xmath33 is given by    @xmath34^{1/2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the principal quantum number , @xmath36 is the orbital exponent , and @xmath37 is the azimuthal quantum number .",
    "the atomic wave functions in the momentum space are related to the coordinate wave functions by    @xmath38    where @xmath39 denote the usual quantum numbers characterizing atomic states .",
    "the radial momentum - wave function defined as    @xmath40    is related to the radial wave function in coordinate space through    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is a spherical bessel function .",
    "the radial wave functions in momentum space @xmath43 are written as    @xmath44    in term of the rhf functions @xmath45 in momentum space , related to @xmath31 through    @xmath46    in the present work we consider @xmath3 and @xmath6 to be spherically symmetric functions .",
    "in fig . [ graph1 ] we present the atomic properties , along with the fisher information in momentum space @xmath47 , as functions of @xmath0 ( for atomic number @xmath48 to @xmath49 ) .",
    "the first atomic property is the _ atomic radius _ , @xmath50 , which is a measure of the atomic size .",
    "it is usually defined as the mean or typical distance between the nucleus and the boundary of the surrounding cloud of electrons . according to quantum theory",
    "the corresponding boundary is not a well - defined physical entity , since electrons are described as probability distributions that gradually diminish as we move away from the nucleus , without a clear , sharp cutoff .",
    "thus , there are various definitions of atomic radius , e.g. the term may apply only to isolated atoms , or also to atoms in condensed matter , covalently bound in molecules , or in ionized and excited states ; and its value may be obtained through experimental measurements , or computed from theoretical models @xcite . here",
    "we use the theoretically calculated values introduced by e. clementi , d. l. raimondi , and w. p. reinhardt @xcite , using scf functions .",
    "the corresponding atomic radii values are in picometres .",
    "inverse ionization energy is another property plotted in this figure . _",
    "ionization energy _",
    "( i.e. ) is the minimum energy required to eject an electron out of a neutral atom or molecule in its ground state @xcite . in general , the @xmath51 ionization energy is the energy required to remove the @xmath51 electron since the first @xmath52 electrons have been removed ; the greater the ionization energy , the more difficult it is to remove an electron .",
    "thus , it can be considered as an indicator of the _ reactivity _ of an element .",
    "ionization energy was formerly called _",
    "ionization potential_. here , we study the _ first ionization energy _",
    ", where the corresponding values of the property are given in atomic units @xcite .",
    "inverse electronegativity is the third property presented .",
    "_ electronegativity _ , @xmath53 , describes the tendency of an atom to attract electrons to itself @xcite .",
    "the electronegativity of an atom depends on both the atomic weight and the distance that its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus .",
    "the higher the electronegativity number associated to an atom the more the ability of the atom to attract electrons to it . here , we use the relative scale introduced by pauling , the pauling scale , where electronegativity is a dimensionless quantity @xcite .",
    "finally , we plot the atomic dipole polarizability .",
    "_ polarizability _ is a property that describes the lowest order response of the electron cloud of an atom or a molecule to an external electric field . _",
    "atomic static dipole polarizability _ ,",
    "@xmath54 , is a linear response property , defined as the second derivative of the total electronic energy with respect to the external homogeneous electric field ( quadratic stark effect ) @xcite .",
    "the values of atomic static dipole polarizability used here are given in atomic units @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath47 simulates the corresponding periodicity pattern that characterizes all four atomic properties .",
    "the overall correlation is found to be excellent and implies that those properties are intimately related to momentum space .",
    "the reason that @xmath47 succeeds to reflect the periodic properties ( of at least the first 54 values of @xmath0 ) is because fisher information is directly related to the local character of the probability distribution .",
    "for instance , if we are interested in momentum space , when @xmath55 is more localized , the derivative @xmath56 takes higher values and the same happens for @xmath47 . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath55 is delocalized in momentum space , then @xmath47 takes lower values . in the case of a noble gas , where we have closed shells atoms , the density distribution in position space @xmath57 is more localized compared to other atoms , while @xmath55 is more delocalized , especially for large values of @xmath58 according to heisenberg s uncertainty principle , thus @xmath47 takes lower values .    in fig .",
    "[ graph2 ] we plot fisher information , disequilibrium and shannon information entropy , in both position and momentum spaces , along with the corresponding  total \" measure , as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "it is seen that besides fisher information @xmath47 which , as mentioned above , provides a lot of information about the atomic structure , @xmath8 is a monotonous increasing function of @xmath0 , and @xmath59 just amplifies the results obtained in @xmath60 case .    for small values of @xmath0 ( @xmath61 ) , disequilibrium",
    "@xmath62 is also a sensitive index , but for elements with higher @xmath0 its behavior is dominated by higher values of @xmath0 and its sensitivity is lower than in the region @xmath63 . in position space , similarly to @xmath8 , disequilibrium @xmath64 does not seem to provide any information about the atomic structure , while the net disequilibrium @xmath22 does provide some insight about atomic structure though they appear certain deviations from the known periodicity of the elements .",
    "the periodicity pattern that characterizes all four atomic properties is also reflected by shannon information entropy @xmath1 in position space , but with less sensitivity compared to @xmath60 . in this sense , fisher information and shannon information entropy present a reciprocal relation in dual spaces i.e. @xmath47 is complementary to @xmath1 . on the other hand , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are almost monotonically increasing functions and seem to carry less information about atomic properties .    finally , lmc complexity and fisher - shannon plane , as functions of @xmath0 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ graph3 ] .",
    "lmc complexity in momentum space reflects the aforementioned properties , something which is expected given that @xmath67 is proportional to @xmath68 . in position space",
    "there is no sign of correlation , and @xmath69 shows the same pattern as @xmath67 with higher values .",
    "fisher - shannon plane is the last measure presented in this work . in momentum space",
    "@xmath70 reveal the atomic structure in a very detailed manner , something that is expected since @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath60 . on the other hand",
    "@xmath71 is a monotonically increasing function , and @xmath72 just like @xmath59 amplifies what has already been found in momentum space .    in order to further explore possible correlations between the various information measures and the experimental quantities we employ the so - called pearson correlation coefficient defined as    @xmath73    where , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are two variables expected of being tied to each other , and @xmath76 , @xmath77 are the mean values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively @xcite .",
    "the coefficient is seen as covariance of the two variables , normalized with dispersions .",
    "actually , pearson coefficient is well suited for picking up a linear correlation between variables .",
    "the definition imposes constraints @xmath78 .",
    "the values of @xmath79 close to @xmath80 signify a very tight correlation between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , while values close to @xmath81 signify lack of a correlation .",
    "it is worth to point out that in our problem pearson coefficient provides only an average correlation between the physical quantities and the relevant information measures and it is not suitable to reflect the characteristics of the system in detail .    in fig .",
    "[ graph4 ] we present a comparative bar chart of the absolute values of pearson coefficient for several measures in momentum space and three of the aforementioned atomic properties ( radius , atomic polarizability , ionization energy ) .",
    "of course net measures also provide values very close to those presented but from fig .",
    "[ graph2 ] it is apparent that these measures only amplify the momentum space trend . we should mention that only @xmath68 against radius has a negative coefficient , but generally disequilibrium does not strongly correlate with any of these three experimental quantities .",
    "shannon information also does not correlate and this is obvious also from the pearson coefficient . on the other hand @xmath60 , @xmath67 and @xmath70 have higher values , something that is also reflected in figs .",
    "[ graph2 ] and [ graph3 ] .",
    "the relation to momentum space stated above can be easily observed if we compare the theory of electron impact ionization with the so - called @xmath82 experiments . in such experiments ,",
    "two continuum electrons emerging from the collision are detected in coincidence , and all electron momentum components measured .",
    "the observed cross - section is called triply differential and for its description a first - order approximation ( called plane - wave impulse approximation ) is adequate .",
    "the corresponding cross - section factorizes into the spin - averaged free electron - electron scattering cross - section @xmath83 ( which depends on the incoming electron momentum @xmath84 and the outgoing electron momenta @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) and the momentum distribution of the ionized electron in its initial state ( with energy eigenvalue @xmath87 ) @xmath88 and is given by the formula @xcite    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the momentum of the recoil ion .",
    "such experiments can be considered as an  electron momentum spectroscopy \" , due to the dependence of the cross - section on the momentum distribution of the initial state .",
    "although in principle we are able to obtain the complete quantum mechanical information on the effective - electron orbitals , in practice only the spherical average @xmath91 can be measured for atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the ionization energy of an atom and consequently energy fluctuations that occur in the system are reflected in momentum space .",
    "more specifically , each orbital has its own density distribution so it is interesting to study the relation between fisher information and energy . instead of energy",
    "we use the second moment of the density distribution in momentum space which is an energy functional and is defined as    @xmath92    we plot @xmath93 versus @xmath60 for atoms with @xmath94 in a log - log diagram ( fig .",
    "[ graph5 ] ) . a linear relationship in each orbital for closed shells ( 1s , 2s , 2p",
    ", 3s , 3p , 3d ) is observed while in orbitals 4s , 4p , 5s this relation is slightly modified because there are atoms with either open shells or both closed and open shells .",
    "the main conclusion is that fisher information exhibits a very good qualitative correlation with properties concerning the atomic structure .",
    "more specifically , @xmath60 is very sensitive to shell effects , simulating some of the most characteristic atomic properties such as the atomic radius , ionization energy , electronegativity , and atomic polarizability .",
    "that correlation is corroborated quantitatively by the pearson coefficient .",
    "this is a reasonable result , since fisher information is closely related to the kinetic energy of a system , and depends on the gradient of the probability distribution , providing a local measure of smoothness , in contrast to shannon , rnyi or tsalis information entropies , which provide a global way of characterizing  uncertainty \" .",
