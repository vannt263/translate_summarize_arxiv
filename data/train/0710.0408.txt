    ", we consider costs similar to ( [ lagcost ] ) .",
    "however , instead of minimizing among all curves , the infimum is taken over a subcollection of curves , called admissible paths .",
    "these paths are given by a control system and the corresponding cost function is called the optimal control cost .",

    "hamiltonian approach remains efficient according to the pontryagin maximum principle .",
    "another problem is appearance of so called abnormal extremals ( singularities of the space of admissible paths ) which we are obliged to fight with .    in sections 2 and 3 , we will recall some basic notions in optimal control theory and the theory of optimal mass transportation which are necessary for this paper .    in section 4 , by using some standard argument in the theory of optimal mass transportation and the pontryagin maximum principle in optimal control theory",

    "these conditions allow us to prove lipschitz continuity for a large class of optimal control cost . hence , proving the existence and uniqueness of optimal map of the corresponding monge s problem ( theorem [ maintransport ] ) .    in section 6 ,",
    "we apply the above results to some subriemannian manifolds , where the cost function is given by the square of the subriemannian distance ( see section 6 for the basic notions in subriemannian geometry ) . in the case of a subriemannian manifold ,",
    "all the mild regularity assumptions are satisfied . using the result in @xcite mentioned above ( proposition [ goh ] )",
    ", lipschitz continuity of the cost can be easily proven in the case of a step 2 distribution ( corollary [ lip2 ] ) .",
