    "lindley s recursion also governs the evolution of the queue - length at certain single server queues , such as the m / m/1 queue @xcite .    since the 1980s , large deviation techniques",
    "have been brought to bear on the analysis of equation and the distribution of an element of its stationary solution , which exists whenever @xmath9 is stationary @xcite .",
    "for example , using a one - dimensional large deviations approach it has been established in broad generality that the stationary distribution possesses logarithmic asymptotics , see @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and references therein",
    ". this fact is exploited in the theory effective bandwidths @xcite and in the development of on - the - fly estimation schemes from observations of the queueing behavior for the determination of quality of service performance metrics @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . moreover , through the use of functional large deviation techniques , assuming @xmath9 is i.i.d .",
    ", the seminal paper @xcite proved the significant , broadly applicable result that the most likely path to a large value of the transient rrw is piece - wise linear .",
    "this deduction has since been extended ( e.g. @xcite ) , including the establishment of results in the stationary regime ( e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "all of these papers report piece - wise linear most likely paths to a large value of the rrw or an element of its stationary solution .",
    "the exclusive focus of all of the research cited above is to garner understanding of likelihood of large values of the rrw either in the transient or stationary regime , and the determination of the most likely paths to these large values . in the present article",
    "we employ a functional large deviation approach to analyze the estimation of a fundamental quantity for the performance evaluation of a rrw that has so far been overlooked : its mean value .",
    "this study reveals substantially richer structure than the study of large values of the rrw , leading to non - convex rate functions and concave most likely paths . despite this ,",
    "perhaps surprisingly , general qualitative and quantitative deductions can still be made .",
    "the starting point of the present paper is the following qualitative result : it was observed recently that simulation of the mean position of a rrw , @xmath11 exhibits non - standard behavior , even for light - tailed increments with negative drift .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 is i.i.d .",
    ", then the probability that @xmath12 underestimates the long run expected value decays exponentially in @xmath13 , but the probability of an over - estimate decays sub - exponentially .",

    "the lower error - probability decays exponentially : for each @xmath17 , @xmath18    the upper error - probability decays sub - exponentially : for each @xmath19 , @xmath20    this paper takes a deeper look at the latter phenomenon , providing a detailed understanding of why it is hard to simulate the mean position of a rrw and , therefore , why care must be taken drawing deductions regarding average queueing performance from the output of a simulation .",
    "we establish that , in broad generality , the process @xmath21 satisfies a large deviation principle ( ldp ) with a non - trivial rate function . as a consequence ,",
    "the likelihood that the sample - mean estimate of a rrw is an overestimate decays on a slower than exponential scale .",
    "the rate function in question is non - convex and this ldp could not , therefore , be established by asymptotic analysis of scaled cumulant generating functions , an approach commonly employed in queueing theory and used in the grtner - ellis method .",
    "unlike the most likely paths of the rrw that lead to a large position which are piece - wise linear @xcite@xcite , we ascertain that that the most likely paths associated with a large simulated mean possess more complex features : they are concave , with a possible discontinuity when the path first becomes deviant .",
    "a number of examples of these general results are presented to demonstrate the range of qualitative possibilities .",
    "the results contained in this article clearly indicate that significant statistical care must be taken when using estimates from simulation of the mean position of a rrw .",
    "this has serious implications for the performance evaluation of queueing systems by simulation techniques where steady state expected queue - length and waiting time are key performance metrics .",
    "our results show , in broad generality , that the most natural estimation scheme , monte carlo estimates , of these expected values suffer a likelihood of over - estimation that is , approximately speaking , weibull - like with shape parameter @xmath22 .",
