    "experts have predicted that the number of devices with communication capability will rise to 50 billions by 2020 @xcite . the resulting web of devices connected by the internet - of - things ( iot ) and machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communications for instance will lead to more sophisticated network topologies .",
    "communication over such networks is in general multi - way , where communicating pairs of nodes exchange information in both directions such as in the two - way channel @xcite .    beside multi - way communication ,",
    "a key aspect of future networks is relaying which can play a key role in improving transmission rates . in multi - way networks in particular ,",
    "the potential of multi - way relaying can be of great importance @xcite .",
    "this is especially true in scenarios where physical - layer network coding can be applied , which can significantly boost the performance of a network @xcite .    for the aforementioned reasons , the multi - way relay channel ( mwrc ) which combines both aspects",
    "( multi - way and relaying ) is an integral part of future networks .",
    "the mwrc consists of multiple users that want to exchange information via a common relay node . in its simplest form with two users",
    ", we get the so called two - way relay channel twrc .",
    "the twrc is a fundamental scenario that has been introduced in @xcite , and studied thoroughly recently in @xcite .",
    "several transmission strategies for the twrc including compress - forward and lattice coding have been examined lately , leading to the capacity of the twrc within a constant gap @xcite .",
    "although the twrc has become well - understood recently , the mwrc has not reached a similar status yet , although several researches have focused on this network recently .",
    "for instance , @xcite study the multi - pair twrc , @xcite study the multi - cast mwrc , @xcite studies the mwrc with cyclic message exchange , and @xcite study the mwrc with multiple uni - cast message exchange . in this paper , we focus on the latter variant of the mwrc , i.e. , the mwrc with multiple uni - cast message exchange , also known as the y - channel @xcite .    in the @xmath0-user y - channel ,",
    "several users want to exchange information in all directions via the relay .",
    "in particular , user @xmath4 wants to communicate with user @xmath5 .",
    "the extension of the twrc to the y - channel is not straightforward , and many challenges have to be tackled when making this step .",
    "one of the challenges is in deriving capacity upper bounds .",
    "while the capacity of the twrc can be approximated with a high - precision using the cut - set bounds @xcite , the capacity of the @xmath0-user y - channel requires new bounds .",
    "such bounds have been derived in @xcite .",
    "another challenge is in finding the best communication strategy .",
    "the @xmath0-user y - channel requires , in addition to bi - directional communication strategies used in the twrc , more involved strategies such as cyclic communication @xcite and detour schemes @xcite .    the single - input single - output ( siso )",
    "@xmath0-user y - channel has been studied in @xcite . here , we focus on the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) case .",
    "the mimo y - channel has been initially introduced in @xcite , where the strategy of signal - space alignment for network - coding was used . in their paper , lee _ et al .",
    "_ characterized the optimal sum degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) of the 3-user mimo y - channel under some conditions on the ratio of the number of antennas at the users and the relay .",
    "however , a complete sum - dof characterization of the general 3-user mimo y - channel was not available until  @xcite where a novel upper bound and a general transmission strategy were developed , thus settling this problem .",
    "the mimo y - channel with more than 3 users has also been studied in @xcite . in @xcite , tian and yener",
    "have studied the multi - cluster mimo y - channel and characterized the sum - dof of the channel under some conditions on the number of antennas , while in @xcite , lee _ et al . _ proposed a transmission strategy for the @xmath0-user mimo y - channel and derived its achievable dof . despite the intensive work on the y - channel ,",
    "many questions remain open .",
    "for instance , the sum - dof of the general @xmath0-user mimo y - channel remains open to date .",
    "a recent development on this front has been achieved recently , when wang has characterized the sum - dof of the 4-user mimo y - channel in @xcite .",
    "another question is on the dof region of the mimo y - channel which is still unknown .",
    "recently , the dof region of the 3-user and 4-user cases was studied in @xcite .",
    "the importance of the dof region is that it reflects the trade - off between the achievable different dof of different users , contrary to the sum - dof which does not .",
    "this trade - off is essential in cases where the dof demand by different users is not the same , such as in a network with prioritized users . in such cases",
    ", it is interesting to know what is the maximum dof that can be achieved by some users under some constraints on the dof of other users .",
    "this question can be answered by the dof region . also , by obtaining the dof region , the sum - dof is obtained as a by - product .    in this paper , we focus on the dof _ region _ of the @xmath0-user mimo y - channel .",
    "we develop a communication strategy for the @xmath0-user mimo y - channel with @xmath1 antennas at the users , and @xmath3 antennas at the relay .",
    "this case models a situation where it is easier to mount antennas at the users than at the relay node , such as when the relay is a satellite node .",
    "our proposed strategy revolves around two ideas : ( i ) channel diagonalization and ( ii ) cyclic communication using physical - layer network - coding .",
    "channel diagonalization is performed by zero - forcing beam - forming  @xcite using the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse .",
    "after channel diagonalization , the mimo y - channel is decomposed into a set of parallel siso y - channels ( sub - channels ) .",
    "then , cyclic communication is performed over these sub - channels .",
    "a cyclic communication strategy ensures information exchange over a set of users in a cyclic manner , such as exchanging a signal from user @xmath6 to @xmath7 , @xmath7 to @xmath8 , and @xmath8 to @xmath6 thus constituting the cycle @xmath9 . in cyclic communication ,",
    "the users send a set of symbols to the relay , which decodes functions of these symbols @xcite and forwards these functions to the users .",
    "these functions have to be designed appropriately , so that each user can extract his desired symbol from these functions after reception .",
    "note that the @xmath0-user y - channel has cycles of length 2 ( @xmath10 e.g. ) up to length @xmath0 ( @xmath11 e.g. ) .",
    "we call the transmission strategy corresponding to an @xmath12-cycle ( cycle of length @xmath12 ) an @xmath12-cyclic strategy . the efficiency of the proposed @xmath12-cyclic strategy is @xmath13 symbol / sub - channel ( or dof / dimension ) .    note that after channel diagonalization , the channel has similarities to the linear - deterministic 3-user siso y - channel studied in @xcite which is a set of parallel binary y - channels , some of which are not fully - connected .",
    "the difference is that the parallel siso y - channels obtained after diagonalization of the mimo y - channel are complex - valued .",
    "furthermore , the work in @xcite considers only the 3-user case , and the extension to the @xmath0-user case is not considered .",
    "thus , the main difference between this work and the one in @xcite is that here we :    1 .",
    "extend the scheme to the complex - valued channel with @xmath14 user , 2 .",
    "provide a graphical illustration of the problem in the form of a message flow graph , 3 .",
    "show that with @xmath0 users , cyclic communication over cycles of various lengths has to be considered , and 4 .",
    "propose an optimal resource allocation strategy which distributes the streams to be communicated over the available sub - channels , and uses the optimal strategies over these sub - channels .",
    "the question that arises at this point is : is it optimal to treat each sub - channel of the mimo y - channel separately @xcite ? or is it better to encode jointly over sub - channels ? to answer this question , one has to optimize the transmission strategy , and observe if the optimized solution requires joint encoding over spatial - dimensions . with this goal in mind , we propose a resource allocation that allocates sub - channels to cyclic strategies based on their efficiencies .",
    "the proposed resource allocation is proved to be optimal by deriving a dof region outer bound using a genie - aided approach .",
    "similar to @xcite , the derived genie - aided bound converts the y - channel into a mimo point - to - point channel whose dof is known @xcite . as a result ,",
    "a dof region characterization for the @xmath0-user mimo y - channel with @xmath3 is obtained .",
    "this provides _ the first dof region characterization for the @xmath0-user mimo y - channel .",
    "_    with the optimal strategy at hand , we can go back to the channel separability question .",
    "we observe that the dof - region - optimal strategy for the mimo y - channel treats the parallel sub - channels jointly , where encoding over spatial dimensions is necessary .",
    "we conclude that the mimo y - channel is not separable .",
    "however , from sum - dof point - of - view ( instead of dof - region ) , separate encoding over each sub - channel is optimal .",
    "another interesting observation is that the optimal strategy is in fact a combination of different cyclic strategies with different efficiencies . in other words , it is not enough to rely on the cyclic strategy with highest efficiency , i.e. , the 2-cyclic strategy .    in the next section ,",
    "we formally define the @xmath0-user mimo y - channel .",
    "we introduce the main result of the paper , which is a dof region characterization of the case @xmath3 in section [ secmainresult ] .",
    "next , we introduce our communication strategy by using a toy - example consisting of a 3-user y - channel in section [ sec:3userychannel ] . the communication strategy for the @xmath0-user case",
    "is described in detail in section [ sec : achievability ] .",
    "comments on the regime where @xmath15 and on the inseparability of the y - channel are given in sections [ sec : ngm ] and [ sec : subchannelsep ] , respectively .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper with a discussion in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the following notation is used throughout the paper .",

    "the relay has @xmath2 antennas , and the users are assumed to be identical in terms of the number of antennas , with @xmath1 antennas at each user .",
    "user @xmath37 has a message @xmath38 to be sent to user @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",

    "having defined the @xmath0-user mimo y - channel , we are ready to present the main result of the paper given in the next section .",

    "this upper bound leads to a dof region outer bound that coincides with which proves the converse of theorem [ thm : dofkusers ] .",
    "details are given in appendix [ sec : converse ] .",
    "the achievability of this theorem is the main focus of the rest of the paper .",
    "the achievability is proved using three steps :    1",
    ".   first , we use zero - forcing pre - coding ( beam - forming ) in the uplink , and zero - forcing post - coding in the downlink to diagonalize the channel , thus transforming it into a set of parallel siso @xmath0-user y - channels ( sub - channels ) .",
    "this is described in section [ sec : chdiag ] .",
    "2 .   second , we perform physical - layer network coding over these sub - channels using different transmission strategies for different modes of message exchange . this step is explained in section [ sec : transtra ] .",
    "third , we solve a resource allocation problem that distributes the available sub - channels optimally among these strategies in section [ sec : resalloc ] .    by using this approach , we are able to show that any dof tuple @xmath77 in the dof region @xmath78 is achievable .",
    "it turns out that the optimal strategy for this channel requires encoding jointly over multiple sub - channels , and that it is not sufficient to encode over each sub - channel separately .",
    "thus , as a by - product of this result , we conclude that the mimo y - channel with @xmath3 is inseparable @xcite .",
    "this aspect is elaborated in section [ sec : subchannelsep ] after proving the achievability of @xmath78 .",
    "but before we proceed , let us consider a toy - example with 3 users to illustrate the transmission strategies which achieve this outer bound .",
    "here , we provide an informal preview of the achievability proof of theorem [ thm : dofkusers ] for the 3-user y - channel . important insights about the optimal strategy for this channel can be obtained from a message - flow - graph ( mfg ) , a graphical representation of the upper bounds which we introduce next .",
    "we first define the message - flow graph ( mfg ) formally , and then we discuss it in more detail .    to a @xmath0-user y - channel and",
    "a desired dof tuple @xmath77 as defined in corresponds a message - flow graph consisting of @xmath0 nodes and @xmath88 directed edges , where the edge connecting nodes @xmath45 and @xmath47 has weight @xmath89 .",
    "now we describe the mfg with more detail .",
    "the message exchange in the y - channel can be represented by an mfg as shown in figure [ fig : messageflow3usersdhat ] . in this graph , each node represents a user , and each directed - edge represents a message and is marked by the corresponding dof ( weight ) .",

    "the dof components involved in this expression can be represented in an mfg as well .",
    "the mfg of this expression is similar to the one of the corresponding y - channel , where an edge from node @xmath45 to node @xmath39 exists if @xmath89 appears in the expression and has weight @xmath89 , and does not exist otherwise .",
    "consider for instance a 3-user y - channel . according to theorem [ thm : dofkusers ] ,",
    "the dof region of a 3-user mimo y - channel with @xmath3 , denoted @xmath92 , is described by the following set of inequalities @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a permutation of @xmath95 .",
    "the upper bound bounds the dof of the message exchange from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , @xmath96 to @xmath98 , and @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "this message exchange can be visualized using the mfg shown in figure [ fig : messageflow3users ] .",

    "notice the following interesting property of this mfg : _ this mfg has no cycles_. we call this property the _ no - cycle property .",
    "_    this property is clearly true for any permutation @xmath94 .",
    "for instance , consider a specific permutation @xmath99 .",
    "for this case , the upper bound above can be written as @xmath100 a cycle would exist if we have @xmath101 or @xmath102 instead of @xmath103 leading to the cycles @xmath10 and @xmath9 , respectively . the bound does not allow such cycles .",

    "the important insight obtained from the no - cycle property is that a dof region optimal strategy for the y - channel should have dof constraints which do not constitute cycles . in other words ,",
    "a strategy that imposes additional constraints , such as @xmath107 e.g. , can not achieve the outer bound .    now let us apply this insight on a 3-user mimo y - channel with @xmath108 .",
    "assume that we would like to achieve the dof tuple @xmath109 over this y - channel . according to theorem [ thm : dofkusers ] , @xmath110 is indeed achievable since it belongs to @xmath92 .",
    "how can we achieve this dof tuple ? to answer this question , let us start by examining a uni - directional strategy over the y - channel .      in a uni - directional strategy ,",
    "the operation of the relay is similar to the operation of a decode - forward ( df ) relay @xcite in a point - to - point relay channel where the message flow is uni - directional .",
    "namely , the relay decodes all signals in the uplink , and re - transmits the signals to the respective destinations in the downlink . using such a uni - directional strategy ,",
    "each signal consumes one dimension of the signal - space at the relay ( 1 dof / dimension ) .",
    "assume that one would want to achieve @xmath111 by using this strategy .",
    "in this case , the achievability of @xmath111 would require @xmath112 in other words , the total dof should not be greater than the number of signal - space dimensions at the relay .",
    "this bound is not satisfied in this example since @xmath113 .",
    "thus , such a uni - directional strategy is not able to achieve @xmath111 .",
    "now let us analyse the bound by using an mfg .",
    "the mfg corresponding to this dof constraint is shown in figure [ fig : messageflow3usersdhat ] .",
    "one can easily see that this mfg violates the no - cycle property since it has the cycles @xmath114 and @xmath115 . to achieve @xmath111",
    ", we need to use strategies which resolve such cycles .",
    "let us first deal with the cycle @xmath114 .",
    "we need a strategy which resolves the length-2 cycle ( @xmath7-cycle ) @xmath114 in , thus replacing the terms @xmath116 by some terms which do not constitute a @xmath7-cycle in the corresponding mfg .",
    "this can be achieved by using a bi - directional strategy as in the twrc @xcite as follows .",
    "each pair of users align the signals they want to exchange over one dimension at the relay .",
    "let users 1 and 2 send the signals @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively , such that they align along one dimension at the relay .",
    "thus , the relay can compute a linear combination of these symbols @xmath119 and forward this to users 1 and 2 in the downlink over one dimension . then",
    ", each user can decode the desired signal after subtracting his own self - interference .",
    "this operation requires 1 dimension to send 2 signals , and is thus more efficient than the uni - directional strategy which requires 1 dimension per signal .    by exchanging these two symbols",
    ", we use @xmath120 dimensions .",
    "the residual dof tuple to be achieved is then @xmath121 .",
    "assume that one would try to achieve @xmath122 using the uni - directional strategy thus requiring @xmath123 more dimensions .",
    "the resulting combination of bi - directional and uni - directional strategies would require @xmath124 dimensions at the relay .",
    "since the relay has @xmath2 dimensions , this combination is possible if @xmath125 but this is not true since @xmath126 . although the use of the bi - directional strategy has reduced the required dimensions from 5 ( uni - directional ) to 4 ( uni - and bi - directional ) , the dof tuple @xmath110 is still not achievable .    at this point , it is worth to emphasize the role of the bi - directional strategy in ` resolving ' @xmath7-cycles . by comparing and",
    ", we can see that the 2-cycle in the mfg of the former has been resolved in the latter .",
    "however , the mfg of violates the no - cycle property as it has the @xmath8-cycle ( cycle of length 3 ) @xmath115 . for this reason",

    "the main components of the transmission strategy are channel diagonalization and a combination of bi - directional , cyclic , and uni - directional transmission strategies .",
    "the optimality of the given strategy is proved by proposing an optimal resource allocation based on the idea discussed in section [ sec:3userychannel ] which we will extend to the @xmath0-user case .",

    "although this noise correlation can be exploited at the receiver to increase the achievable rate , this is not necessary from a dof point of view .",
    "thus , we can assume that these noises are independent , which delivers a worst - case performance .",

    "details are provided in appendix [ app : optproof ] . with this , the proof of achievability of theorem  [ thm : dofkusers ] is complete .",
    "the mimo y - channel has different dof based on the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the relation between the two can classified qualitatively into three regimes .",
    "one regime corresponds to the case where @xmath358 .",
    "the other corresponds to the case where @xmath3 . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "the problem becomes more challenging . from this point of view , it is important to study the former two regimes and explore their properties in order to come one step closer to a general solution .    in this paper ,",
    "we have considered the regime where @xmath359 . in this case , the columns of the uplink channel matrix @xmath54 span the whole receive signal - space at the relay .",
    "therefore , the spaces spanned by the columns of @xmath54 and @xmath360 , @xmath47 , completely overlap .",
    "consequently , the users have to share this signal - space in an optimal manner in order to achieve the dof of the channel .",
    "the optimal scheme has been developed in this paper , where the importance of cyclic communication has been demonstrated .    in the other regime corresponding to @xmath358 , the columns of the uplink matrix @xmath54 span a sub - space of the receive signal - space at the relay , and the sub - spaces spanned by @xmath54 and @xmath360 do not intersect . here",
    "the users do not have to share dimensions of the signal - space , as these dimensions are sufficiently many .",
    "decode - forward becomes optimal in this case .",
    "in particular , the uplink is treated as a multiple access channel , and the downlink as a broadcast channel .",
    "the achievable dof region is described by @xmath361 for all @xmath362 , and it coincides with the cut - set bounds .    in the intermediate case",
    "where @xmath363 , the columns spanned by the channel matrices @xmath54 , @xmath364 , intersect at the relay .",

    "if @xmath367 and @xmath368 , then each three users share @xmath369 dimensions at the relay , and so on .",
    "the main difference in this case is that pre - coding using the pseudo - inverse is not permissible .",
    "however , a similar scheme can be applied after designing appropriate pre- and post - coding matrices .    in a @xmath0-user y - channel where the relay has @xmath15 antennas ,",
    "the relay can use post - coding to recombine the received signals over each antenna to form @xmath2 observations , each with @xmath370 variables .",

    "the design of the optimal scheme is not an straightforward extension of the case considered in this paper .",
    "the main additional ingredient is the _ design of the optimal pre - coders and post - coders for a given dof tuple _ so that the desired observations are obtained at the relay .",
    "we did not have to go through this step in this paper since for @xmath3 , the same pre - coding allows achieving all dof tuples .",
    "given the pre- and post - coders , the coding schemes discussed in this paper ( uni - direction , bi - directional , and cyclic ) can be used over the resulting sub - channels . it is not clear whether such a combination would be optimal in general .",
    "the problem of designing the optimal scheme for @xmath389 thus remains an open problem .",
    "the sum dof of the 4-user case has been characterized in @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that the outer bound derived in this paper also applies for @xmath15 . in general , the outer bound can be stated as @xmath390 where @xmath84 is a permutation of @xmath85 and @xmath86 is its @xmath45-th component ( see appendix [ app : optproof ] ) .",
    "combined with the the cut - set bounds @xmath391 for all @xmath362 , we get a general outer bound . as discussed above , this outer bound is tight for @xmath3 and for @xmath358 .",
    "however , we expect that it is not tight in the intermediate regime .",
    "similarly , the inner bound developed in this paper holds in for a general mimo y - channel as @xmath392 since if @xmath15 , we can deactivate @xmath393 antennas at the relay and still apply our scheme .",
    "this inner bound is also not tight in general . in conclusion ,",
    "the dof region of the general mimo y - channel remains an open problem , and requires further investigation .",
    "an interesting aspect of mimo systems is their channel separability / inseparability .",
    "separability of a mimo channel means that independent coding on each sub - channel suffices to achieve the dof of the channel .",
    "a mimo point - to - point channel is an example of a separable mimo channel .",
    "the main consequence of this separability is that the transmission can be optimized ( in terms of achievable rate ) using water - filling .",
    "the optimal scheme in this case consists of channel diagonalization , separate coding , plus power allocation .",
    "inseparability on the other hand means that joint encoding over multiple sub - channels is necessary to achieve the dof of the channel .",
    "in particular , in an inseparable channel , signals sent over different sub - channels are not always independent , and decoding is performed by considering multiple sub - channels jointly at the receiver .",
    "a mimo interference channel is an example of an inseparable mimo channel @xcite .",
    "the optimal scheme in such cases becomes more sophisticated .",
    "in general , the processing at the transmitters and the receivers of a separable channel is simpler compared to that of an inseparable channel . in this section",
    ", we make some remarks on channel separation of the y - channel .",
    "we have seen that the optimal strategy that achieves the dof region of our setup is a combination of bi - directional , cyclic , and uni - directional strategies .",
    "the resulting combination leads to coding over several sub - channels of the mimo system .",
    "more precisely , the cyclic strategy with cycle length @xmath273 requires coding over @xmath311 sub - channels .",
    "let us examine what would happen if one were to use a channel separation approach instead .    in the channel separation approach",
    ", there is no interaction between different sub - channels , and the signals transmitted over a sub - channels can be decoded by only observing this particular sub - channel . while this is not possible for cyclic strategies with cycle length @xmath273 , this is possible for the bi - directional and the uni - directional strategies .",
    "so what would happen if we would rely only on those two strategies ?",
    "we have seen in section [ sec : bidirstra3user ] that using these two schemes only over a 3-user mimo y - channel with @xmath394 is not sufficient .",
    "namely , the dof tuple @xmath395 can not be achieved by this combination as shown in the example in section [ sec : bidirstra3user ] .",
    "consequently , a channel separation approach is not optimal in the given scenario . rather than channel separation , one has to code over several sub - channels by using the @xmath8-cyclic strategy to achieve the given dof tuple .",
    "the same behaviour can be shown for a general @xmath0-user mimo y - channel with @xmath3 . in conclusion ,",
    "the mimo y - channel is in general not separable .",
    "however , a channel separation approach is optimal in terms of sum - dof .",
    "if we are not interested in the dof trade - off between different dof component ( a trade - off which is reflected by the dof region ) but we are rather interested in the sum - dof , then the bi - directional strategy ( which can be applied in a channel separation approach ) suffices . to show this , note that the dof region @xmath78 implies that the sum - dof is given by @xmath396",
    "this can be shown by summing up the upper bound corresponding to @xmath397 and the one corresponding to @xmath398 in theorem [ thm : dofkusers ] . to achieve @xmath399 dof in total , the resources ( @xmath2 sub - channels ) can be distributed among the @xmath400 @xmath7-cycles of the y - channel in any desired manner .",
    "then , each pair of users in a @xmath7-cycle exchange two signals ( one signal in each direction ) over each sub - channel assigned to this @xmath7-cycle .",
    "we have @xmath2 sub - channels in total , and thus , this strategy achieves @xmath399 dof",
    ". a simple allocation would be to serve one pair of users at a time , and to change the served pair of users in a round - robin fashion .",
    "since we have @xmath401 @xmath7-cycles in the @xmath0-user y - channel , this round - robin technique would achieve @xmath402 dof per message .",
    "consequently , @xmath403 for all @xmath404 , for a sum - dof of @xmath399 which is the optimal sum - dof .",
    "note that this scheme is fair ; it achieves a symmetric dof tuple where all users get the same dof . in conclusion ,",
    "the mimo y - channel is separable from sum - dof point of view .",
    "note that throughout this work , the uplink and downlink of the y - channel were considered separately .",
    "no adaptive coding has been used at the source nodes . in other words ,",
    "the signals sent by the users in the uplink are independent of what they received in the downlink .",
    "this separation turns out to be optimal for our problem .",
    "this kind of separability first appeared in the context of the gaussian two - way channel @xcite where adaptive coding is not necessary , and separation is optimal from capacity point of view .",
    "we have characterized the dof region of the mimo y - channel with @xmath0 users , @xmath2 antennas at the relay , and @xmath359 antennas at the users .",
    "the dof region is proved to be achievable by using channel diagonalization in addition to a combination of bi - directional , cyclic , and uni - directional communication strategies .",
    "channel diagonalization decomposes the mimo channel into @xmath2 parallel siso sub - channels over which the cyclic and uni - directional strategies are performed .",
    "the bi - directional and cyclic strategies use compute - forward at the relay to deliver several linear combinations of different signals to the users , such that each user is able to extract his desired signals . in other words , the main ingredient of these strategies is physical - layer network - coding . the uni - directional strategy is based on decode - forward .",
    "this combination of strategies is optimized by using a simple resource allocation approach .",
    "namely , we allocate resources ( sub - channels ) to different strategies based on their efficiency , starting with the most efficient and ending with the least efficient one .",
    "although this optimal resource allocation solution is intuitive , it has an interesting property . in order to design an optimal scheme , we have to combine strategies with different efficiencies .",
    "in other words , relying on the strategy with highest efficiency ( bi - directional strategy ) is not enough .    as a by - product",
    ", we conclude that the mimo y - channel can not be separated into disjoint parallel sub - channels without degrading its performance . in general , one has to code over multiple sub - channels to achieve the whole dof region of the channel .",
    "the approach used in this paper can be applied to derive the capacity region of @xmath0-user siso y - channels within a constant gap . to do this ,",
    "the cyclic communication strategies should be applied to derive the capacity region of the linear deterministic y - channel .",
    "then , the results can be extended to the gaussian case as in @xcite .",
    "this is left for future work .",
    "the authors would like to express their gratefulness to dr .",
    "karlheinz ochs ( rub , germany ) for the fruitful discussions .",
    "in this section , we prove the converse of theorem [ thm : dofkusers ] . we need to show that the dof region of the mimo y - channel with @xmath3 is outer bounded by @xmath405 where @xmath84 is a permutation of @xmath85 and @xmath86 is its @xmath45-th component .",
    "let us consider the permutation @xmath398 and prove the upper bound holds for this particular permutation .",
    "we need to show that any achievable dof tuple must satisfy @xmath406    this bound is shown by using the genie - aided upper bound in @xcite .",

    "let us also give @xmath409 , @xmath410 to user 1 as side information .",
    "now , consider any achievable rate for the channel , for which every node can obtain its messages with an arbitrarily small probability of error .",
    "this means that , after @xmath30 channel uses , user 1 can decode @xmath411 from @xmath412 , and @xmath413 . after decoding its desired messages ,",
    "user 1 combines its side information with the decoded messages to obtain @xmath414 , which is the same observation as that of user 2 .",
    "this makes user 1 able to decode @xmath415 since user 2 can decode them from the same observation .",

    "@xmath423 where @xmath424 as @xmath73 , and where the second step follows by using the definition of mutual information , the fact that conditioning does not increase entropy , and the markov chain @xmath425 we can write this bound as @xmath426 where @xmath427 but this is the mutual information between the input @xmath247 and the output @xmath428 of a mimo @xmath87 point - to - point channel .",

    "this proves for the permutation @xmath398 .",
