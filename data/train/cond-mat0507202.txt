    "if nodes are randomly removed , the criterion for losing global connectivity , @xmath44 , is obtained when the single node with degree @xmath45 , the _ hub _ node , is removed or when almost all of the degree 1 nodes , the _ leaf _ nodes , are removed . the probability that almost all the leaf nodes are removed before the hub node is removed approaches 0 for large @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the number of nodes which are removed before the hub node is removed . since the removal is random , @xmath11 is uniformly distributed between @xmath46 and @xmath45 and , from eq .",

    "* for small @xmath53 , the network loses global connectivity when all @xmath53 high degree nodes are removed .",
    "the probability that all @xmath53 high degree nodes are removed after the first @xmath11 nodes of all types have been removed is @xmath67    here @xmath11 is now the average number of nodes that must be removed before all @xmath53 high degree nodes are removed .",
    "then @xmath68 and @xmath69 note that @xmath63 does not depend on @xmath6 since changing @xmath6 results simply in a different number of links between the high degree nodes ; if our criterion for collapse is the removal of all high degree nodes , the number of links between them is irrelevant .",
