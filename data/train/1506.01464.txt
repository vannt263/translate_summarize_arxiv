    "invisibility efforts by scientists have focused on building a broadband , omnidirectional cloaking device  @xcite . such a cloak that works in macroscopic dimensions , for the entire visible spectrum , with the full - field of light",
    "may be considered an ` ideal ' cloaking device  @xcite .",
    "much of this research was spawned by the initial omnidirectional cloaking designs , which used artificial materials ( called ` metamaterials ' ) to control electromagnetic fields / waves  @xcite .",
    "this field was called ` transformation optics , ' since coordinate transformations were used to design the necessary material properties that morphed space for light .",
    "transformation optics has produced many ingenious designs and devices  @xcite .",
    "however , creating the required spatial distribution of metamaterials , their anisotropy , and causality , limit the spectrum to single frequencies , or to a narrow bandwidth , and is particularly difficult to manufacture for visible frequencies  @xcite .",
    "much of the scientific work on cloaking has retained the omnidirectionality and full - field ( amplitude and phase of light waves ) nature of transformation optics  @xcite . with this , to make forays into large bandwidths in the visible spectrum , researchers have built reflecting ` carpet cloaks '  @xcite , proposed non - euclidean geometry mapping  @xcite , demonstrated macroscopic ray optics cloaks ( matching directions , rather than phases , of fields )  @xcite , and suggested strongly diamagnetic superconductors  @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , researchers have investigated the fundamental limits on bandwidths for these omnidirectional cloaks .",
    "it is generally agreed that causality requires such cloaking of a non - zero volume , either passive or active  @xcite , to be only possible for single frequencies  @xcite .",
    "chen et al . showed that zero scattering cross - section of a cloaked object ( for an omnidirectional transformation optics cloak in two - dimensions ( 2d ) ) can not be attained by neighboring frequencies of the target frequency , no matter how narrow the bandwidth  @xcite .",
    "they then derived an upper bound for the bandwidth that was proportional to the scattering cross - section radius .",
    "hashemi et al .",
    "have also provided a theoretical bound for transformation optics cloaks , even if perfectly manufactured , which shows increased imperfections for increasing bandwidth  @xcite .",
    "derived from causality , their `` diameter - bandwidth product '' limit states that the effective bandwidth is inversely proportional to the cloaked object diameter .",
    "they suspect a similar sensitivity to ` carpet cloaks ' as well .",
    "similarly , monticone and al showed that any linear , passive , non - diamagnetic cloak must increase the overall scattering , compared to an uncloaked object , when integrated over all wavelengths  @xcite . even if scattering is suppressed in a finite bandwidth",
    ", this will need to be `` paid back '' in the rest of the spectrum . on the other hand , leonhardt and",
    "tyc s broadband solution is a three - dimensional ( 3d ) , anisotropic cloak  @xcite .",
    "their `` price to pay for practical invisibility '' is relaxing the full - field requirement to allow time delays .",
    "our approach has been to begin with broadband cloaking for the entire visible spectrum , but within the paraxial approximation , then to expand the cloaked size and angles  @xcite .",
    "this is typically the method used in optical engineering , as increasing the field - of - view ( angles ) and/or numerical aperture ( refractive index multiplied by the solid angle of the accepted light ) can be challenging  @xcite .",
    "so in this paper , we use the definition for `` cloak '' that is to `` hide , '' since the cloaked object is not necessarily covered in all directions as if by a garment .",
    "our previous ray optics demonstration relaxed both angles and phase to show that only four lenses were needed for 3d , macroscopically scalable , stand - alone cloaking for small angles  @xcite .",
    "our paraxial cloak was the simplest design we found that used isotropic optics designed for the entire visible spectrum .",
    "these optics have been well understood for centuries  @xcite and are readily available off - the - shelf .",
    "interestingly , hashemi et al . concluded by suggesting a relaxing of angles and phase , to possibly obtain a precise understanding of when the cloaking problem becomes easy  @xcite .",
    "they considered knowing what cloak was the `` weakest '' relaxed , yet still practical for large objects , to be valuable , due to the difficulties of transformation optics cloaks .",
    "we now remove the ray optics requirement , to complete a paraxial cloaking theory that works for the full - field ( matched amplitude _ and _ phase ) .",
    "such paraxial full - field cloaking satisfies all but the omnidirectionality condition of an ` ideal ' cloaking device .",
    "this ` paraxial ' formalism can work for up to @xmath0  @xcite , which is practical for many cases where the cloak is not placed immediately before an observer .",
    "although we discuss the propagation of a monochromatic field , since an arbitrary field of light can be written as a linear superposition of monochromatic waves , our theory extends to broadband without loss of generality .",
    "duan et al .",
    "recently provided phase matching with their unidirectional cloaking system based off of geometric optics  @xcite .",
    "they provided a heuristic reason why rays that pass through the edge of their optical system may match the phase of rays that pass through the center instead , for their particular setup with split lenses .",
    "they then simulated phase - matched cloaking for discretely separated wavelengths of micro - waves to mm - waves . here",
    "we analytically show phase matching for general paraxial optical systems , including continuously multidirectional cloaks .",
    "it is based on the formula given by siegman and others , for propagation of any paraxial field through a generalized paraxial optical system  @xcite .",
    "the resulting formula is proved using fermat s principle and huygens integral , by accounting for the optical path lengths of all rays .",
    "field propagation based off of huygens principle of wavelet propagation , is effective and widely used in diffraction theory and fourier optics  @xcite .",
    "we first assume that the ambient medium is spatially uniform with index of refraction @xmath1 , and that the optical system is rotationally symmetric for simplicity .",
    "non - uniform medium  @xcite or non - rotationally symmetric systems  @xcite can be derived from here",
    ".     * ideal ( ` perfect ' ) paraxial cloak . *",

    "( [ eq : cloak - metric ] ) . by comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : huygens - e2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : e2-perfect - field - cloak ] ) , we see that a ray optics cloak can be a full - field cloak , if @xmath21 .",
    "specifically , this is the case when @xmath22 ( absolute phase - matching ) , or when @xmath23 ( phase - matching to integer multiples of @xmath24 ) .",
    "the significance of these conditions is that they allow for phase - matched , full - field cloaking for _ any _ incoming fields within the paraxial approximation .",
    "the phase - matching condition only needs to be satisfied once for a given optical system , and then all ray directions and positions , or any field distribution ( @xmath25 ) will exit as if traversed through ambient space .",
    "note that a ray optics cloak will usually be phase - matched with a full - field cloak , by integer multiples of @xmath24 , for multiple , but discretely separated , wavelengths automatically .",
    "however , we can do better and match it for a continuous , broad bandwidth with appropriate dispersion control .",
    "one method for broadband phase matching is to add a thin , flat plate to a ray optics cloak , anywhere between the background object(s ) and the observer . since it is `` thin '' and flat , the original abcd matrix ( eq .  ( [ eq : cloak - metric ] ) )",
    "will be unchanged  @xcite and only the @xmath26 factor outside the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : huygens - e2 ] ) will be affected .",
    "we consider the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cloakbox - ray2field ] , where the flat plate is placed immediately after a ray optics cloak .",
    "let @xmath27 be the total length of the _ original _ ray optics cloak ( so @xmath28 ) , where @xmath29 is the number of original optical elements .",

    "there are infinitely many combinations of @xmath8 and @xmath38 that are possible for @xmath39 .",
    "ultimately , the choice of which to use should depend on physically realizable @xmath7 s .",
    "a few such solutions , that phase - corrects the four lens ray optics cloak in @xcite , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4lens - nc-1 ] . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed that the cloaking system is placed in air , with @xmath40 for all wavelengths , and we ignored any coatings .",
    "the lens coatings can be modeled as additional thin plates as needed .",
    "we also only consider the visible spectrum ( 400 - 700 nm , for our discussion ) .",
    "a thicker compensating flat plate can reduce the required dispersion range , but this also affects the imaging quality , so we have purposely limited its thickness here .",
    "* dispersion of phase - correcting plate for a four lens symmetric cloak .",
    "* various thin , flat plates are used to match the full - field cloak condition ( eq .",

    ". the dispersion relation of the refractive indices for these plates are shown , for various values of @xmath38 and @xmath8 , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : thinplate - phase - correct-2-m ] ) in ambient air . ]",
    "many of the solutions for positive refractive indices require anomalous dispersion , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4lens - nc-1 ] . for the purposes of cloaking , such dispersion for broadband spectrum with low losses",
    "is needed to imitate ambient space properly .",
    "this is similar to the finite bandwidth cloak made of anisotropic layers , as suggested by kildishev et al . , which required strong anomalous dispersion combined with loss compensation  @xcite .",
    "costa and silveirinha have suggested using nanowire metamaterial to provide such anomalous dispersion , and they numerically calculated their index of refraction to be near @xmath41 for the entire visible spectrum  @xcite .",
    "they can achieve these low loss , broadband , anomalous dispersion properties by utilizing the collective , spatial properties of metamaterials .",
    "this allows the high loss and narrow band properties of typical transparent materials , imposed by the kramers - kronig relations , to be overcome  @xcite .",
    "in addition , theisen and brown have experimentally demonstrated anomalous dispersion for @xmath42 @xmath43 wavelengths , with gallium implanted silicon pads  @xcite . these have refractive indices near 2 or 4 , with variations of about 1 over the spectrum , depending on the doping level .",
    "negative - index metamaterials are good candidates for phase - correction as well  @xcite .",
    "the utilization of metamaterials may have been expected , since we expanded ray optics cloaking to the field cloaking aspect of transformation optics .",
    "much progress is being made , both theoretically and experimentally , for creating negative index materials for broadband optical frequencies  @xcite .",
    "some refractive index values demonstrated experimentally include between -3 and 0 for microwave frequencies in 2d  @xcite , n = 0.63   at 1,200   nm to n = -1.23   at 1,775  nm in a low loss , 3d bulk material  @xcite , and n = 1 to -7.5 for 1.1 - 2.4 @xmath43 wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "by relaxing only omnidirectionality for an ` ideal ' cloak , we have shown how to match the phase for the whole visible spectrum .",
    "the phase - matching plate may require negative index metamaterials or anomalous dispersion , which are broadband and low loss , but current research has shown much progress in this regard .",
    "we had shown that building a 3d , broadband , macroscopic cloak , for the visible spectrum , can be fairly `` easy '' for ray optics in the small angle limit  @xcite .",
    "extending this to the full - field seems to not be too challenging with recently developed materials . as with typical lens designs",
    ", we expect that extending such cloaks to large angles may be difficult , though possible .",
    "however , making it work for all angles appears to likely be fundamentally limited .",
    "realizing omnidirectionality from a paraxial full - field cloak has not been achieved to our knowledge , as this coincides with achieving broadband with transformation optics cloaks . by showing paraxial cloaking that is broadband to be practical , but without a similar ease for omnidirectional and broadband cloaks , our work supports recent work showing a trade - off between broadband and scattering cross - section .",
    "this is because small scattering cross - section implies large angles , and zero cross - section gives omnidirectionality .",
    "it is interesting that paraxial full - field cloaking does not require anisotropy , though being 3d , macroscopic , and broadband .",
    "anisotropy seems to be a requirement when creating an omnidirectional cloak , from a paraxial cloak , not necessarily a property of 3d or field cloaks alone  @xcite .",
    "although our cloak is broadband , greenleaf et al .",
    "have shown that the cloaked material itself has eigenfrequencies that need to be avoided for proper cloaking  @xcite .",
    "as a side , most , if not all , cloaks to date , can be detected by measuring a pulse incident on the cloak  @xcite .",
    "this is the same for our cloak presented here , unless absolute phase is matched with negative index materials .",
    "finally , an open question seems to be whether an isotropic , 3d , omnidirectional , broadband cloak can be achieved for ray optics .",
    "this is possible for anisotropic materials  @xcite , but an isotropic , 3d , omnidirectional , full - field cloak is not possible  @xcite .",
    "however , accepting time delays might allow some freedom , as shown here where ray optics allowed relaxing of the material requirements .",
