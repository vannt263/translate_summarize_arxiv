    "the study of gravitational collapse attracts researchers towards it by the fact that it represents theoretical and observable phenomena in the universe .",
    "it is an important open issue in relativistic astrophysics whether the final outcome of the gravitational collapse is formation of a black hole or a naked singularity(joshi - malafarina [ 1 ] and references therein ) .",
    "still there is no established theory available which can determine the final fate of this collapse .",
    "there is no iron - clad evidence that black hole candidates are indeed black holes .",
    "there is no logic that prevents existence of naked singularities and as per cosmic censorship conjecture penrose [ 2 ] himself considers this an open question .",
    "understanding the characteristics and features of final fate of a collapsing system is not just important from the theoretical perspective ; it has tremendous observational consequences as well .",
    "virbhadra with his collaborators showed that black holes and naked singularities could be observationally differentiated through their gravitational lensing features ( virbhadra - ellis [ 3,4 ] ; virbhadra - keeton [ 5 ] ; virbhadra [ 6 ] and also references therein ) .    in view of classical gravity , to understand the nature of collapse and physical behaviour of a collapsing system properly ,",
    "it is necessary to construct a realistic model of the collapsing system .",
    "it is very difficult task on account of the highly non linear nature of the governing field equations .",
    "many efforts have been made for reducing the complexity and various methods for simplifications are frequently adopted and the pioneering work of oppenheimer - snyder [ 7 ] was the initial step in this direction when collapse of a highly idealised spherically symmetric dust cloud was studied . since then",
    "several attempts have been made to construct realistic models of gravitationally collapsing systems to understand the properties and nature of collapsing objects .",
    "it gained to tremendous momentum when vaidya [ 8 ] presented a solution describing the exterior gravitational field of a stellar body with outgoing radiation and the modified equations in this case proposed by misner [ 9 ] and lindquist et al.[10 ] for an adiabatic distribution of matter .",
    "it is an established fact that gravitational collapse is a highly dissipating energy process ( herrera - santos [ 11 ] ; herrera et al .",
    "[ 12 ] , mitra [ 13],[14 ] ) .",
    "however , the dissipation of energy from collapsing fluid distribution is described in two limiting cases .",
    "the first case describes the free streaming approximation and a number of solutions of radiating fluid ball in this case discussed by tewari [ 15 - 18 ] .",
    "further pant- tewari [ 19 ] presented a quasar model with all degree of suitability . while second one is diffusion approximation and in this case",
    "the dissipation is modeled by heat flow type vector and in this the model proposed by glass [ 20 ] has been extensively studied by santos [ 21 ] for the junction conditions of collapsing spherically symmetric shear - free non - adiabatic fluid with radial heat flow . on a similar ground a number of studies have been reported by de oliveira et al .

    "herrera [ 40 ] investigated that the local pressure anisotropy is one of the responsible factors for inhomogeneities in energy density . on a same ground",

    "the main objective of this work is to shed some light on the final fate of gravitational collapse by taking tewari and charan [ 46 ] solution as seed solution .",
    "final fate of our model is the formation of a black hole . by taking a set of model parameters we have developed a supernovae model .",
    "the interior matter fluid is spherically symmetric , shear - free , anisotropic radiating away its energy in the form of radial heat and contracting in size during the process of collapse .",

    "<S> initially the interior solutions represent a static configuration of perfect fluid which then gradually starts evolving into radiating collapse . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed that the model is well behaved for a set of model parameters and there are a number of such sets for which the model is well behaved . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent luminosity as observed by the distant observer at rest at infinity and the effective surface temperature are zero in remote past at the instant when the collapse begins and at the stage when collapsing configuration reaches the horizon of the black hole .    </S>",
