    "research into the bias temperature instability ( bti ) has revealed a plethora of puzzling issues which have proven a formidable obstacle to the understanding of the phenomenon @xcite . in particular , numerous modeling ideas have been put forward and refined at various levels .",
    "most of these models have in common that the overall degradation is assumed to be due to two components : one component ( @xmath0 ) is related to the release of hydrogen from passivated silicon dangling bonds at the interface , thereby forming electrically active @xmath1 centers @xcite , while the other ( @xmath2 ) is due to the trapping of holes in the oxide @xcite .",
    "however , these models can differ significantly in the details of the physical mechanisms invoked to explain the degradation .    at present , from all these modeling attempts two classes have emerged that appear to be able to explain a wide range of experimental observations : the first class is built around the concept of the reaction - diffusion ( rd ) model @xcite , where it is assumed that it is the _ diffusion _ of the released hydrogen that dominates the dynamics .",
    "the other class is based on the notion that it is the _ reactions _ which essentially limit the dynamics , and that the reaction rates are distributed over a wide range @xcite . in other words , in this _",
    "reaction_-limited class of models , both interface states ( @xmath0 ) and oxide charges ( @xmath2 ) are assumed to be ( in the simplest case ) created and annealed by first - order reactions . in contrast , in the _",
    "diffusion_-limited class ( rd models ) , the dynamics of @xmath0 creation and annealing are assumed to be dominated by a _",
    "diffusion_-limited process , which controlles both long term degradation and recovery .",
    "many of these models have been developed to such a high degree that they appear to be able to predict a wide range of experimental observations @xcite .",
    "typically , however , experimental data are obtained on large - area ( macroscopic ) devices where the microscopic physics are washed out by averaging . in nanoscale devices , on the other hand , it has been shown that the creation and annihilation of individual defects can be observed at the statistical level @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate in the following that _ this statistical information provides the ultimate benchmark for any bti model , as it reveals the underlying microscopic physics to an unprecedented degree_. this allows for an evaluation of the foundations of the two model classes , as it clearly answers the fundamental question : _ is bti reaction- or diffusion - limited _ ?",
    "as such , the benchmark provided here is simple and not clouded by the complexities of the individual models .",
    "since the stochastic response of nanoscale devices to bias - temperature stress lies at the heart of our arguments , we begin by experimentally demonstrating the equivalence of large- and small - area devices . for this",
    ", we compare the degradation of a large - area device to the average degradation observed in 27 small - area devices when subjected to negative bti ( nbti ) .",
    "all measurements in the present study rely on the ultra - fast @xmath3 technique published previously @xcite , which has a delay of @xmath4 on large devices . due to the lower current levels",
    ", the delay increases to @xmath5 in small - area devices . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : smalllarge ] , although the degradation in small - area devices shows larger signs of variability , discrete steps during recovery , and is about 30% larger than in this particular large - area device , the average dynamics are identical @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a measurement delay of @xmath5 , a power - law in time ( @xmath6 ) with exponent @xmath7 is observed during stress while the averaged recovery is roughly logarithmic over the relaxation time @xmath8 .",
    "this demonstrates that by using nanoscale devices , the complex phenomenon of nbti can be broken down to its microscopic constituents : the defects that cause the discrete steps in the recovery traces .",
    "analysis of the statistics of these steps will thus reveal the underlying physical principles .",
    "it has been shown that the hole trapping component depends sensitively on the process details , particularly for high nitrogen contents @xcite , possibly making the choice of benchmark technology crucial for our following arguments . however , for industrial grade devices with low nitrogen content such as those used in this study , no significant differences in reported @xmath3 drifts to published data have been found @xcite .",
    "the pmos samples used here are from a standard @xmath9 cmos process with a moderate oxide thickness of @xmath10 and with a nitride content of approximately 6% , while the poly - si gates are boron doped with a thickness of @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , our previously published data obtained on the same technology as that of fig .  [ f : smalllarge ] has recently been interpreted from the rd perspective @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : relaxrd ] , without showing any anomalies .",
    "this fit seems to suggest that after @xmath12 and @xmath13 recovery is dominated by _ diffusion_-limited @xmath0 recovery , a conclusion we will put to the test in the following .",
    "for our experimental assessment we use the time - dependent defect spectroscopy ( tdds ) @xcite , which has been extensively used to study bti in small - area devices at the single - defect level @xcite .",
    "since such devices contain only a countable number of defects , the recovery of each defect is visible as a discrete step in the recovery trace , see fig .",
    "[ f : smalllarge ] .",
    "the large variability of the discrete step - heights is a consequence of the inhomogeneous surface potential caused by the random discrete dopants in the channel , leading to percolation paths and a strong sensitivity of the step - height to the spatial location of the trapped charge @xcite .",
    "typically , these step - heights are approximately exponentially distributed @xcite with the mean step - height given by @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 is the value expected from the simple charge sheet approximation @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the elementary charge , @xmath18 the permittivity of the oxide , @xmath19 the area , and @xmath20 the oxide thickness .",
    "experiments and theoretical values for the mean correction factor @xmath21 are in the range @xmath22@xmath23 @xcite .    in a tdds setup ,",
    "a nanoscale device is repeatedly stressed and recovered ( say @xmath24 times ) using fixed stress / recovery times , @xmath25 and @xmath8 .",
    "the recovery traces are analyzed for discrete steps of height @xmath26 occurring at time @xmath27 .",
    "each @xmath28 pair is then placed into a 2d histogram , which we call the spectral map , formally denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "the clusters forming in the spectral maps reveal the probability density distribution and thus provide detailed information on the statistical nature of the average trap annealing time constant @xmath30 . from the evolution of @xmath29 with stress time , the average capture time @xmath31 can be extracted as well .",
    "so far , only exponential distributions have been observed for @xmath27 , consistent with simple independent first - order reactions @xcite .    in our previous tdds studies ,",
    "mostly short - term stresses ( @xmath32 ) had been used .",
    "based on this short - term nature , the generality of these results may be questioned , since also @xmath0 recovery predicted by rd models result in discrete steps @xcite .",
    "as we have pointed out a while ago @xcite , however , the distribution of these rd steps would be loglogistic rather than exponential , a fact that should be clearly visible in the spectral maps . in the following , we will conduct a targeted search for such loglogistic distributions and other features directly linked to _ diffusion_-limited recovery processes using extended long - term tdds experiments with @xmath33 .",
    "before discussing the long - term tdds data , we summarize the basic theoretical predictions of the two model classes . both model classes have in common that the charges trapped in interface and oxide states induce a change of the threshold voltage .",
    "depending on the location of the charge along the interface or in the oxide , it will contribute a discrete step @xmath34 to the total @xmath3 .",
    "due to only occasional electrostatic interactions with other defects and measurement noise , @xmath34 is typically normally distributed with mean @xmath35 .",
    "the mean values @xmath35 themselves , however , are exponentially distributed @xcite .",
    "the major difference between the model classes is whether creation and annealing of @xmath0 is _ diffusion- _ or _",
    "reaction_-limited , resulting in a fundamentally different form of the spectral map @xmath29 , as will be derived below .",
    "being the simpler case , we begin with the dispersive _ reaction_-limited models .      in an agnostic formulation of dispersive _",
    "reaction_-limited models , creation and annealing of a single defect are assumed to be given by a simple first - order reaction @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the probability of having a charged defect after stress and recovery times @xmath25 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the physics of trap creation enter the average forward and backward time constants @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is important to highlight that equation ( [ e : avg ] ) may describe both the _ reaction_-limited creation and annealing of interface states @xcite , as well as a charge trapping process @xcite .",
    "we recall that even more complicated charge trapping processes involving structural relaxation and meta - stable defect states ( such as switching oxide traps ) can be approximately described by an effective first - order process , at least under quasi - dc conditions @xcite .    having @xmath38 defects present in a given device ,",
    "the overall @xmath3 is then simply given by a sum of such first - order processes @xmath39",
    "the most important aspect is that the time constants are observed to be widely distributed .",
    "we have recently used such a model to explain bti degradation and recovery over a very wide experimental window assuming the time constants to belong to two different distributions , one tentatively assigned to charge - trapping and the other to interface state generation @xcite .    at the statistical level , recovery in such a model",
    "is described by the sum of exponential distributions . the spectral map , which records the emission times on a logarithmic scale , is then given by @xmath40 with the stress time dependent amplitude @xmath41 and @xmath42 describing the p.d.f .",
    "of @xmath26 , with mean @xmath35 and standard deviation @xmath43 .",
    "an example spectral map simulated at two different stress times is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : nmp - threedefects ] , which clearly reveals the three contributing defects .",
    "we note already here that contrary to the rd model , the spectral map of the dispersive first - order model depends on the individual @xmath44 , which can be strongly bias and temperature dependent .      as a benchmark rd model",
    "we take the latest , and according to @xcite the physically most likely variant , the poly @xmath45/@xmath46 model : here it is assumed that @xmath45 is released from @xmath47@xmath45 bonds at the interface , diffuses to the oxide - poly interface , where additional @xmath47@xmath45 bonds are broken to eventually create @xmath46 , the _ diffusion _ of which results in the @xmath48 degradation behavior typically associated with rd models .",
    "recovery then occurs via reversed pathways .",
    "while other variants of the rd model have been used @xcite , which can not possibly be exhaustively studied here , we believe our findings are of general validity , as all these models are built around _",
    "diffusion_-limited processes .    in large - area devices the predicted long - term recovery after long - term stress can be fitted by the empirical relation @xmath49 with @xmath50 , provided diffusion is allowed into a semi - infinite gate stack with constant diffusivity in order to avoid saturation effects . quite intriguingly , a similar mathematical form has been successfully used to fit a wide range of experimental data , using a scaled stress time , though @xcite . remarkably , experimentally observed exponents are considerably smaller than what is predicted by rd models , corresponding to a wider spread over the time axis .    in an empirically modified model",
    ", it has been assumed that in a real 3d device , recovery will take longer compared to ( [ e : rd - relax ] ) since the @xmath45 atoms will have to `` hover '' until they can find a suitable dangling bond for passivation @xcite .",
    "however , using a rigorous stochastic implementation of the rd model , we have not been able to observe significant deviations from ( [ e : rd - relax ] ) , irrespective of whether the model is solved in 1d , 2d , or 3d , provided one is in the diffusion - limited regime @xcite . as such , significant deviations from the basic recovery behavior ( [ e : rd - relax ] )",
    "still have to be rigorously justified .",
    "one option to stretch the duration of recovery would be the consideration of dispersive transport @xcite .",
    "our attempts in this direction were , however , not found to be in agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , consistent with experiment @xcite , a distribution in the forward and backward reactions can be introduced into the model @xcite .",
    "this dispersion will stretch the distribution ( [ e : rd - relax ] ) , i.e. increase the parameter @xmath51 , but may also lead to a temperature dependence of the power - law slope , features which have not been validated so far .",
    "nevertheless , a dispersion in the reaction - rates as used for instance in @xcite will not change the basic _ diffusion_-limited nature of the microscopic prediction as shown below .    in order to study the stochastic response of the poly @xmath45/@xmath46 model",
    ", we extended our previous stochastic implementation @xcite of the @xmath45/@xmath46 rd model to include the oxide / poly interface following ideas and parameters of @xcite .",
    "since any sensible macroscopic model is built around a well - defined microscopic picture , in this case non - dispersive diffusion and non - dispersive rates , these features of the microscopic model must be preserved in the macroscopic theory , leaving little room for interpretation . in order to be consistent with the @xmath52 devices used in our tdds study , we chose @xmath53 @xcite . furthermore",
    ", a typical density of interface states @xmath54 @xcite is assumed .",
    "we would thus expect about 300 such interface states to be present for our tdds devices .    before looking into the predictions of this rd model in a tdds setting",
    ", we calibrate our implementation of the poly @xmath45/@xmath46 model to experimental stress data , see fig .",
    "[ f : rd - check ] ( left ) . in order to obtain a good fit",
    ", we follow the procedure suggested in @xcite and subtract a virtual hole trapping contribution of @xmath55 from the experimental data to obtain the required @xmath56 power - law . also , we remark that to achieve this fit , unphysically large hydrogen hopping distances had to be used in the microscopic model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath46 had to be allowed to diffuse more than a micrometer deep into the gate stack with unmodified diffusion constant to maintain the @xmath56 power - law exponent , despite the fact that our poly - si gate was only @xmath11 thick . from ( [ e :",
    "rd - relax ] ) we can directly calculate the expected unnormalized probability density function for rd recovery as @xmath57 which after normalization by @xmath58 is a loglogistic distribution of @xmath59 with parameter @xmath51 and mean @xmath60 . in the framework of the standard non - dispersive rd model ,",
    "all interface states are equivalent in the sense that on average they will have degraded and recovered with the same probability at a certain stress / recovery time combination . in terms of impact on @xmath3 , we again assume that the mean impact of a single trap @xmath35 is exponentially distributed .    using ( [ e : rd - relax - pdf - single ] ) , the spectral map built of subsequent stress / relax cycles can be obtained . since except for their step - heights",
    "all defects are equivalent , the time dynamics can be pulled out of the sum to eventually give @xmath61 this is a very interesting result , as it implies that all defects are active with the same probability at any time , leading to a dense response in the spectral map as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : rd - numberofdefects ] . as will be shown ,",
    "this is incompatible with our experimental results .    in",
    "order to more clearly elucidate the features of the rd model , we will in the following use a @xmath62 device , in which only a small number of defects ( about ten ) contribute to the spectral maps .",
    "the crucial fingerprint of the rd model would then be that these clusters are loglogistically distributed and thus much wider than the previously observed exponential distributions .",
    "furthermore , we note that the rd spectral map does not depend on any parameter of the model nor does it depend on temperature and bias @xcite , but due to the _ diffusion_-limited nature of the model shifts to larger times with increasing stress time ( see fig .  [",
    "f : rd - sm ] ) , facts we will compare against experimental data later .",
    "as noted before , previous tdds experiments had been limited to stress times mostly smaller than about @xmath63 , which may limit the relevance of our findings for long - term stress . as such",
    ", it was essential to extend the stress and relaxation times to @xmath64 , which is a typically used experimental window @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the stress / relax cycles needed to be repeated at least 100 times , otherwise differentiation between exponential and logistic distributions would be difficult .",
    "we therefore used 9 different stress times for each experiment , starting from @xmath65 up to @xmath64 with recovery lasting @xmath64 , repeated 100 times , requiring a total of about 12 days .",
    "about 20 such experiments were carried out on four different devices over the course of more than half a year .",
    "since we are particularly interested in identifying a _ diffusion_-limited contribution to nbti recovery , we tried to minimize the contribution of charge trapping . with increasing stress voltage ,",
    "an increasing fraction of the bandgap becomes accessible for charging @xcite , which is why we primarily used stress voltages close to @xmath66 of our technology ( about @xmath67 @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been observed that at higher stress voltages defect generation in a tddb - like degradation mode can become important @xcite , an issue we avoid at such low stress voltages .",

    "finally , we have argued that our results are not only interesting for modeling enthusiasts , but have fundamental practical implications regarding the way devices should be optimized and analyzed for reliability , particularly for nanoscale devices , which will show increased variability .",
    "the research leading to these results has received funding from the fwf project n@xmath8023390-m24 and the european community s fp7 project n@xmath80261868 ( mordred ) .",
    "in this appendix three finer points are discussed , namely                  strictly speaking , equation ( [ e : rd - relax - pdf - single ] ) is valid for a single stress / relax cycle while the tdds consists of a large number of repeated cycles . as such",
    ", the tdds setup corresponds to an ultra - low - frequency ac stress and the devices will not be fully recovered prior to the next stress phase .",
    "this implies that @xmath45 would be able to move deeper into the gate stack during cycling and that the @xmath45 profile would not be precisely the same as that predicted during dc stress @xcite . for short stress times and long enough recovery times ,",
    "e.g. @xmath63 versus @xmath64 , the impact of this would be small , since ( [ e : rd - relax - pdf - single ] ) predicts nearly full recovery in this case ( 97% ) .",
    "however , for larger stress times , recovery by the end of the cycle will only be partial and ( [ e : rd - relax - pdf - single ] ) may no longer be accurate in a tdds setting .",
    "we have considered this case numerically in fig .",
    "[ f : rd - histo ] ( left ) , which shows that although this impacts the absolute number of recorded emission events , the general features  namely loglogistically distributed clusters which move in time  remains .      as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f : longtermtdds - maps ] , with increasing stress time the number of visible clusters increases , as does the noise - level , making an accurate extraction of the statistical parameters more challenging than for shorter stress times . in order to guarantee that our extraction algorithm , which splits the recovery trace into discrete steps ,",
    "does not miss any essential features and the noise in the spectral maps is really just unimportant noise rather than an overshadowed rd contribution , we performed one additional test : we calculate the difference between the extracted response of forward and backward reactions and subtract it from all recorded steps , see fig .",
    "[ f : rd - histo ] ( right ) .",
    "as can be seen , even if due to noise not all steps are considered in the fit , no hidden rd component is missed .      finally , we comment on the permanent part that builds up during the tdds cycles , see fig .",
    "[ f : longtermtdds - fit ] .",
    "this contribution is not explicitly modeled here but only extracted from the experimental data to be added to the modeled recoverable part . from an agnostic perspective",
    ", one could simply refer to this permanent build - up as due to those defects with emission or annealing times larger than the maximum recovery time , @xmath64 in our case .",
    "this permanent build - up is typically assigned to interface states ( @xmath1 centers ) @xcite , but likely also contains a contribution from charge traps with large time constants @xcite .",

    "<S> after nearly half a century of research into the bias temperature instability ( bti ) , two classes of models have emerged as the strongest contenders : one class of models , the reaction - diffusion models , is built around the idea that hydrogen is released from the interface and that it is the _ diffusion _ of some form of hydrogen that controls both degradation and recovery . while many different variants of the reaction - diffusion idea have been published over the years , the most commonly used recent models are based on non - dispersive reaction rates and non - dispersive diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the other class of models is based on the idea that degradation is controlled by first - order _ reactions _ with widely distributed ( dispersive ) reaction rates . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that _ these two classes give fundamentally different predictions for the stochastic degradation and recovery of nanoscale devices , therefore providing the ultimate modeling benchmark . _ using detailed experimental time - dependent defect spectroscopy ( tdds ) data obtained on such nanoscale devices , we investigate the compatibility of these models with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the _ diffusion _ of hydrogen ( or any other species ) is unlikely to be the limiting aspect that determines degradation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the data are fully consistent with _ reaction_-limited models . </S>",
    "<S> we finally argue that only the correct understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to the significant device - to - device variation observed in the degradation in nanoscale devices will enable accurate reliability projections and device optimization . </S>"
