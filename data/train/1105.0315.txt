    "this coupling is insensitive to sub - gap excitations or cooper pair tunneling events through josephson junctions , which do not change the fermion parity of the nanowire .",
    "the remaining sensitivity to charge noise is minimized by decoupling the flux qubit from the topological qubit when the operation is completed .",
    "in this paper we consider an alternative way to perform parity - protected operations on a topological qubit , with an expected reduced sensitivity to charge noise . instead of a flux qubit , we propose to use the socalled transmon qubit , which is a superconducting charge qubit with large ratio of josephson energy over charging energy @xcite .",

    "the sensitivity to charge noise can be made exponentially small by increasing @xmath18 ( through a variation of the flux @xmath1 ) , so that the bands become flat and fluctuations in @xmath7 do not lead to an uncertainty in energy ( which is the origin of dephasing ) .    in a typical device @xcite , the band spacing @xmath46 varies in the range @xmath47 , for ratios @xmath39 increasing from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
