    "the baryon spectrum has attracted a lot of theoretical and experimental interest for a long time because it is expected to reveal important information on the internal structure of baryons and the mechanism of quark confinement .",

    "however , although some of the predicted states have been identified from the @xmath12 and @xmath13 scattering data , many of them have not yet been observed in any experiments @xcite .",
    "these states , so called as the _ missing resonances _ , are what we are facing with and long seeking for @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary and meaningful to search for these states and study their properties in other reactions .",
    "the @xmath14 reaction is a very ideal channel for studying the @xmath0 resonances with isospin 3/2 since the contributions of the @xmath11 with isospin 1/2 are filtered out in this channel .",
    "some results have been obtained on the experimental and theoretical aspects , however , it is far from being sufficient to reveal the contribution of the @xmath15 on the basis of these results .    at present , there are only a few experimental data on the total cross section of the @xmath1 reaction ab88,tr06,yu07,yu10,ab10,yu11 .",
    "what is worse , it is known that the close - to - threshold data are inconsistent between the cosy-11 , hires and cosy - anke groups .",

    "however , if the strong coupling of the @xmath3 to the @xmath21 is confirmed , it is probable that the strong @xmath129 interaction is excluded to some confidential level and the coupling of the @xmath77 to the @xmath21 has to be checked by the low range of m@xmath173 in invariant mass spectra .",
    "fortunately , it is hopeful that the invariant mass distributions and the dalitz plot could discriminate these solutions because various contribution is evidently distinguishable as we have presented .",
