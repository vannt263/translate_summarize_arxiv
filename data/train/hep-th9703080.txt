    "take on values at times @xmath4 with the discrete time intervals @xmath5 @xmath6 given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the fundamental time unit of the system .",
    "an important principle of our formulation is that the mechanics is regarded as exact regardless of the magnitude of @xmath9 and not an exercise in approximation .",
    "this means that invariants of the motion are constructed to be conserved precisely and not up to some given order in @xmath10    as in _",
    "paper i _ our discrete time approach takes its cues from continuous time mechanics , but ultimately is more than an approximation to such a formalism . in general",
    "the continuous time lagrangians @xmath11 for the systems of interest to us in this paper are the spatial integrals of lagrange densities @xmath12 of the form @xmath13 .",
    "important concepts in our methodology are those of the _ system function _ and _ virtual path .",
    "_ in our formalism the system function has the status occupied by the lagrangian in continuous time mechanics .",
    "we may calculate equations of motion and conserved quantities if we know the system function .",
    "we may also use the system function to define conjugate momenta and to quantise our theory .",
    "we construct the system function from the continuous time lagrangian by integrating over certain trajectories , which we refer to as virtual paths .",
    "these are not solutions to the normal euler - lagrange equations of motion but paths chosen according to specific criteria such as gauge invariance .    in our approach",
    "we shall discuss discrete time mechanics based on a temporal lattice with successive points given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is non - zero and independent of @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 is a dynamical variable depending on time we will normally define a virtual path @xmath18 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 in @xmath21-value space by the linear rule @xmath22 where @xmath23 runs from @xmath24 to @xmath25 and @xmath26 this means that over the interval @xmath27 $ ] the time @xmath28 is related to @xmath23 by the rule @xmath29 this prescription is modified when we include gauge invariance , as discussed in ",
    "@xmath30 .  with the above virtual path prescription time derivatives",
    "are naturally turned into differences , i.e. @xmath31    it is possible to use a different temporal lattice .",
    "a popular choice in recent years has been the so - called @xmath32-lattice , where we define @xmath33 , where @xmath32 is real and not equal to unity .",

    "we may even generalise in the manner of klimek @xcite and define @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is some chosen real valued function and then the above prescription gives @xmath42",
    "the regular temporal lattice is given by the function @xmath43 in klimek s formulation .",
    "we shall use this lattice throughout this paper , applying it to the schrdinger wave equation , the free neutral scalar field , the free charged scalar field , the maxwell fields and potentials and to the dirac field , and show how to couple these fields in a gauge invariant way .",
    "the quantisation of our discrete time field theories will be discussed in the next paper of this series , _ paper iii _ , following the principles discussed in _",
    "paper i_. a detailed discussion of quantum electrodynamics will be presented in _",
    "paper iv _ of this series .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "first we review hamilton s principal function in continuous time field theory and then discuss the related concept of system function in discrete time field theory .",
    "we derive the field cadzow s equations of motion and discuss the maeda - noether theorem for the construction of invariants of the motion .",
    "then we apply our formalism to the schrdinger equation , as an example of a @xmath44 process , where @xmath45 represents the process of quantisation and @xmath46 represents the process of discretisation of time .",
    "the resulting theory is a classical field theory which is not the same as the result of the @xmath47 process discussed in _",
    "paper i_.    then we turn to relativistic theories .",
    "the @xmath46 process breaks lorentz invariance , but in a less emphatic fashion than space - time lattice theories such as those discussed by yamamoto et al . @xcite .",
    "the systems we study here are the free neutral and charged klein - gordon fields , the maxwell potentials and their coupling to the charged scalar field , and the dirac equation .",
    "this sets the scene for second quantisation , i.e. the @xmath48 process , which is discussed in _ paper iii_.",
    "in this section we review some aspects of continuous time mechanics field theory which are relevant to our method of discretisation . following the principles outlined in _ paper i _ we shall consider a dynamical field system for which we have knowledge of the dynamical variables @xmath49 at a sequence of times @xmath50 where @xmath51 an important construction in continuous time mechanics is hamilton s principal function @xmath52 defined as the integral @xmath53 over the classical solution to the field equations which satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath54 @xmath55 is a functional of @xmath56 and @xmath57 and is the continuous time analogue of the system function in discrete time mechanics .",
    "if the momentum @xmath58 conjugate to @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 and the hamiltonian @xmath61 defined by @xmath62 then for an infinitesimal variation @xmath63 of the fields we find @xmath64 _ { t_n}^{t_{n+1}},\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath65 denotes an equality holding over the true or dynamical trajectory . from this we deduce the functional derivatives @xmath66 and the partial derivatives @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the value of the hamiltonian at time @xmath69 .    by the process of constructing @xmath70 for each of the intervals",
    "@xmath71 , \\;n=0,1, ... ,n-1,$ ] we arrive at an action integral from @xmath72 to @xmath73 which is equivalent to the action sum @xmath74 if the end point field values are held fixed @xmath75 then this sum depends on the field values @xmath76 at the intermediate time @xmath77",
    "@xmath78 if now we vary these intermediate fields and apply a variational principle we find the equations @xmath79 these are the continuous time mechanics analogues of cadzow s equations of motion @xmath80 in discrete time field theory , discussed in the next section .",
    "the above equations @xmath81 essentially ensure the continuity of the conjugate momenta at the end points of the sub - intervals .",
    "we turn now to the discretisation of lagrange based field theories based on the construction of the system function @xmath82 using the principles outlined in _ _ paper i__@xmath83 by definition , the system function is the integral @xmath84 with some choice of virtual path @xmath85 in field value space .",
    "once the temporal integral has been carried out the system function is a function of the field values @xmath86 at times @xmath69 , @xmath87 and their spatial derivatives at those times .    given the system function , the action sum @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 and it is this which replaces the action sum @xmath90 in continuous time mechanics .",
    "we derive the equations of motion using @xmath91 and a variational principle in the standard fashion @xmath92 .",
    "consider infinitesimal variations of the fields with fixed end - points , @xmath93 .",
    "assuming the fields fall off rapidly at spatial infinity , we apply cadzow s action principle to obtain the discrete time field equations of motion @xmath94 which are equivalent to @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the system function density defined by @xmath97    the construction of constants of the motion is straightforward using noether s theorem applied to discrete systems . consider an infinitesimal transformation @xmath98 of the fields which leaves the system function unchanged . then using the equation of motion we deduce that the quantity @xmath99 is conserved on dynamical trajectories . in _ paper i _ we referred to this as the maeda - noether theorem @xcite .    for linear momentum",
    "consider a transformation of the fields by the infinitesimal shift @xmath100 assuming that the lagrange density is not explicitly dependent on position then we find that the conserved linear momentum @xmath101 is given by @xmath102    for orbital angular momentum , consider a transformation of the fields by an infinitesimal rotation @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the transformation matrix for the spin indices . from this",
    "we may construct the conserved angular momentum @xmath105    other conserved quantities such as electric charge are just as readily obtained by the same method .",
    "in _ paper i _ we discussed the possible non - commutativity of the processes of quantisation @xmath45 and discretisation @xmath46 . in that paper",
    "we presented an approach to @xmath45 after the application of @xmath46 to point particle lagrangians . here",
    "we shall consider applying our @xmath46 to a case where @xmath45 has already been carried out .",
    "the first application of our approach to the temporal discretisation of field theories is chosen to be the schrdinger wave equation for a particle in an external time - independent potential .",
    "first we note that the schrdinger equation may be derived as a classical field equation in continuous time mechanics using the wave function @xmath106 and its complex conjugate @xmath107 as dynamical field variables with the lagrangian density @xmath108    the euler - lagrange equation of motion @xmath109 leads to the usual schrdinger equation @xmath110 and similarly for the complex conjugate wave - function .    turning to our discretisation process",
    ", we define our virtual paths by @xmath111 for @xmath112 $ ] , where @xmath113 etc . and",
    "@xmath114 then the system function turns out to be @xmath115    using @xmath116 , cadzow s equation of motion for @xmath106 is @xmath117 and similarly for the complex conjugate .",
    "this is our discretisation of the schrdinger equation and represents the process @xmath118 applied to a standard continuous time mechanics point particle system .",
    "although in this theory there is no direct concept of a hamiltonian , this does not mean that there are no conserved quantities analogous to continuous time energy .",
    "we define a stationary state solution to the discrete time schrdinger equation @xmath119 to be of the form @xmath120 where @xmath121 may be thought of as a discrete time energy .",
    "then we find @xmath122 reduces to @xmath123 where the eigenvalue @xmath124 is given by @xmath125 a plot of @xmath126 as a function of @xmath127 shows a periodic graph which passes through @xmath128 with a slope of unity , so that for low energies ( compared to @xmath129 ) @xmath121 is virtually identical with @xmath124 .",
    "then the graph rises to a local maximum when @xmath130 at which point @xmath124 has the value @xmath131 if , as we imagine , @xmath15 is a very small timescale , such as the planck time , then @xmath132 is in practical terms far beyond any energy scale encountered in the laboratory or in any astrophysical or cosmological context , except possibly close to the big bang . beyond the local maximum at @xmath133",
    "the graph falls to zero and goes negative , followed by a local minimum and a return to zero .",
    "thereafter it repeats this overall pattern .",
    "we note here the possibility of resonances , where the values of @xmath121 differ by multiples of @xmath134 these vanish in the limit @xmath135 @xmath24 .",
    "assuming @xmath136 and disregarding the resonances , there are two distinct values of @xmath121 which would give the same value of @xmath137 of these , the lower value would correspond to a normal physical state energy in practice whereas the higher value would be associated with a state with an enormous temporal oscillation factor .",
    "we expect that such a state would not be created in the laboratory under normal situations , because the scattering amplitudes to go to such states oscillate very rapidly in time and this would lead to cancellations to zero in detailed scattering calculations .",
    "as far as the resonances go , these give stationary solutions which differ by at most a sign to one of the two mentioned above , and so do not represent new states and can be ignored .",
    "an interesting question is whether every eigenfunction of the continuous time equation @xmath138 generates a stationary state solution to @xmath119 of the form @xmath139 .",
    "the answer is no if we require @xmath121 to be real .",
    "for energy eigenvalues greater than @xmath140 solutions to @xmath141 will develop an imaginary component , giving discrete time wave - functions which grow or decay exponentially , and such wave - functions can not be regarded as being stationary .",
    "an analogous cut - off phenomenon will be seen when we discuss the klein - gordon equation in ",
    "@xmath142 .    to find a conserved charge we first rewrite the equation of motion ( [ s1 ] ) in the form @xmath143    where @xmath144 now consider the global gauge transformation @xmath145 and apply the maeda - noether theorem discussed in  3 .",
    "then we find the invariant of the motion @xmath146 which reduces to the standard total probability in the limit @xmath147with the equations of motion @xmath148 we find @xmath149 from the charge @xmath150 we construct the charge and current densities , given by @xmath151 which satisfy the discrete time equation of continuity @xmath152    the density @xmath153 above is not positive definite except in the limit @xmath154 , when the normal density @xmath155 is recovered .",
    "this is analogous to what happens in continuous time mechanics to the charge density for the charged klein - gordon equation before we take the limit @xmath156 .",
    "one of the reasons occasionally cited for schrdinger s rejection of a relativistic wave equation in 1925 - 26 is because of just this point , there being no evidence at that time for positive electron charge densities .",
    "we imagine that if discrete time mechanics had been the accepted classical mechanical paradigm prior to wave mechanics then the born probability interpretation of schrdinger wave mechanics would probably not have been proposed .",
    "if we wish to couple electromagnetic fields in a gauge invariant way to the schrdinger equation we need to choose a modified virtual path .",
    "such a path is used for the charged klein - gordon equation discussed below , and so this is left as an exercise in the case of the schrdinger equation .",
    "an important system is the free scalar field system with lagrange density @xmath157 where we shall take @xmath158 and three spatial dimensions .",
    "hamilton s principal function is given by @xmath159 \\cos \\left ( p_0t\\right ) -2\\varphi _ { n+1}\\left ( \\mathbf{x}\\right ) \\varphi _ n\\left ( \\mathbf{y}\\right ) \\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath160 now compare this principal function with that for the continuous time mechanics harmonic oscillator , where the phenomenon of recurrence occurs , as discussed in _ paper i_. we note that in the field theory , recurrence occurs in momentum space . by inspection of @xmath161 singularities in the momentum space",
    "integrand appear to arise whenever @xmath162 @xmath163 to understand this here we first construct the conjugate momenta in terms of the end - point field values using @xmath164 from the principal function @xmath165 we find @xmath166 which satisfies the expected relation @xmath167 if we assume the fields vary smoothly with time .",
    "important constructions are the momentum fields @xmath168 which are time independent modulo the klein - gordon equation . using @xmath169 we find @xmath170 and similarly for its complex conjugate .",
    "the time independence of the above momentum fields means that @xmath171 moreover , the momentum fields are not singular , as is evident from @xmath172 , so that in the limit @xmath173 the apparent singularity in @xmath174 must be cancelled by recurrence behaviour in the fourier transforms @xmath175    we deduce from @xmath176 that the fourier transformed fields @xmath177 satisfy the equation of motion @xmath178 this shows that the continuous time klein - gordon field behaves like the discrete time harmonic oscillator discussed in _",
    "paper i _ and the discrete time klein - gordon field discussed next , but with one important difference .",
    "the magnitude of the factor @xmath179 in the above equation of motion never exceeds unity and this ensures that the motion is never hyperbolic .",
    "there is no need therefore for a momentum cut - off in the continuous time theory .",

    "this will occur in all our discrete time field models based on special relativistic lagrangians .",
    "we note that a similar equation was found for the scalar field in the @xmath201poincar theory of lukierski et al .",
    "@xmath202 , with the important differences that their lattice parameter corresponding to our @xmath15 is imaginary and that they are dealing with continuous time throughout .",
    "we turn now to particle - like solutions to the equation of motion .",

    "the fundamental conclusion from this analysis is that energy and momentum are bounded above for physical particle states in our approach . in  other words , in discrete time field theory",
    ", the spectrum of acceptable particle states has a natural cut - off which can be made as large enough to avoid a violation of observed particle data as necessary by choosing the time interval @xmath15 small enough .",
    "an interesting point is that for a given @xmath9 there can be no scalar particle species with rest mass greater than @xmath217 , but this can not be regarded as of interest to experimentalists at this time .",
    "we note that by construction the momentum fields are time independent and satisfy @xmath218 this allows us to construct a logan invariant @xcite of the motion @xmath219 which in the limit @xmath220 becomes the standard field theory hamiltonian , using the result @xmath221 = a\\left ( \\mathbf{p}\\right ) .\\ ] ] for those trajectories for which the limit exists .",

    "first , this system function looks complicated .",
    "however , that is a matter of notation , as the expression @xmath295 is equivalent and much more compact . there is undoubtedly much dynamical content in this system function and calculations would no doubt require approximations to be made .",
    "however we recall here gell - mann s dictum that it is better to make approximations to exact equations than to solve exactly approximate equations .",
    "also , most applications would themselves be better considered from a second quantised approach , which we shall study in _ paper iv _ of this series .",
    "we may simplify the system function considerably by considering the special case when the external magnetic potential @xmath296 vanishes",
    ". then the system function reduces to @xmath297 which leads to the equation of motion @xmath298 \\stackunder{c}{= }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{q^2t^2}{30}\\left\\ { \\left ( \\nabla \\phi _ n\\right ) ^2\\left [ u_n\\varphi _ { n+1}-\\varphi _ n\\right ] -\\left ( \\nabla \\phi _ { n-1}\\right ) ^2\\left [ \\varphi _ n - u_{n-1}^{*}\\varphi _ { n-1}\\right ] \\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{iqt}{12}\\left\\ { \\nabla \\phi _ n\\cdot ( u_n\\nabla \\varphi _ { n+1}+\\nabla \\varphi _",

    "we turn now to the continuous time dirac equation @xmath300 which is obtained from the lagrange density @xmath301 + \\frac{_1}{^2}\\left [ -i\\dot{\\psi}% ^{+}-i\\psi ^{+}\\mathbf{\\alpha \\cdot \\overleftarrow{\\nabla } } \\right ] \\psi -m\\psi ^{+}\\beta \\psi .\\ ] ] the virtual paths are taken to be @xmath302 and then we find the system function density @xmath303 where @xmath304 from this we find the cadzow equation of motion @xmath305 where @xmath306 and similarly for the conjugate field @xmath307",
    "this is the required discretisation of the dirac equation @xmath308    this equation has the same structure as that for the grassmannian oscillator discussed in _ paper i_. to determine the regime for elliptic ( particle like ) behaviour , we first fourier transform @xmath309 , defining @xmath310 and then @xmath311 becomes @xmath312 where @xmath313 , which has the property @xmath314 @xmath124 being the definition of the particle s energy ( keeping in mind there is no hamiltonian in this theory ) .",
    "now define the dirac matrix @xmath315 and rescale the momentum fields via the rule @xmath316 then we find @xmath317 where @xmath318 , which proves that oscillator behaviour is inherent in this system .",
    "particle like solutions will occur for @xmath319 , from which we deduce the condition @xmath320 this upper limit is one half of the upper limit @xmath321 established for the discretised klein - gordon equation .",
    "exactly the same phenomenon occurs in the grassmannian oscillator studied in _",
    "paper i_.    we shall leave the construction of conserved quantities such as the linear momentum and the logan invariant built up from the ladder operators @xmath322 etc . , as exercises .",
    "however , we will discuss here the charge and charge current densities .",
    "first , we rewrite the cadzow equations of motion @xmath323 in the more useful form @xmath324 where @xmath325 .    now",
    "the system function @xmath326 is invariant to the infinitesimal global gauge transformation @xmath327 so that there is a conserved charge given by @xmath328 it is easy to use the equations of motion @xmath329 to show that @xmath149 the charge and current densities are then given by @xmath330 these collapse to the standard densities in the limit @xmath331 and satisfy the discrete time equation of continuity @xmath332 as required .",
    "this completes our discussion of the free dirac equation .",
    "the coupling of the dirac field to the electromagnetic field in a gauge invariant way follows exactly the same procedure as with the charged klein - gordon field discussed in  8 , with virtual paths following the rules given by @xmath333 .",
    "second quantisation of the free dirac field and qed will be discussed in the fourth in this series .",
    "in this paper we have extended the methods outlined in the first paper of this series to classical fields , including scalar , vector , and spinor fields .",
    "the construction of equations of motion and invariants of the motion is straightforward and gauge invariance also can be readily built into the system function .",
    "it is clear that the discretisation process does separate out timelike and spacelike terms in most equations , so that some of the elegance of a fully lorentz covariant theory is lost .",
    "this is an inevitability in any discretisation process .",
    "however , this disadvantage should be viewed alongside the potential advantages , which may be considerable .",
    "first , our approach is exact , in that we do not countenance approximations within the theory itself , only in applications .",
    "equations of motion are derived exactly from well - specified system functions , and invariants of the motion are precisely that , i.e. , exact invariants of the motion and not approximate invariants of the motion .",
    "next , there is a natural scale introduced into the theory , namely the fundamental time interval @xmath15 .",
    "this influences the dynamics of the fields and leads to an upper limit for particle state energies , where the definition of particle state requires field amplitudes to remain bounded in time ( corresponding to the condition @xmath334 in the harmonic oscillator ) .",
    "this holds some promise as a regulariser in quantum field theory , where in conventional calculations ad hoc cutoffs have to be introduced routinely .",
    "one of the surprises discrete time mechanics has sprung is how well it can work .",
    "although it is certainly not equivalent to continuous time mechanics , in almost every aspect of the latter the former can make a comparable statement .",
    "we do not have a hamiltonian in discrete time mechanics , but we do have a system function which can be used to generate equations of the motion , invariants of the motion , and define quantisation , as discussed in paper _ i_. in the case of free fields we can readily construct a logan invariant which substitutes for the hamiltonian in a particularly useful way , closed allied with the particle content of the theory .",
    "this raises the important question : if indeed all continuous time dynamical theories can be simulated by discrete time analogues , given a small enough @xmath335 , so that no empirical test could distinguish between their predictions , what would force us to pick one approach rather than the other ?",
    "one theory is elegant but badly defined mathematically in many places , whilst the other looks clumsier but is perhaps better defined mathematically .",
    "ultimately it may come down to a question of personal choice , which will be influenced by some intrinsic features of the approach .",
    "for instance , the construction of feynman path integrals as infinite products of integrals can not be carried out in the usual way in discrete time field theory , simply because in that theory there is no meaning to the taking of the limit @xmath154 , other than to show some sort of consistency with conventional theory .",
    "therefore , one of the serious objections to the conventional path integral formalism , that of being ill - defined , is greatly moderated in discrete time theory .",
    "there is something like a path integral , but it involves a finite number of time steps between initial and final times , as discussed in paper _ i_. in paper @xmath336 of this series we shall discuss the second quantisation of field theories using this approach .",
    "we are pleased to thank prof .",
    "j. lukierski for his invaluable comments at an early stage in this work and for material assistance in finding important references and opportunities to discuss discrete time mechanics ."
