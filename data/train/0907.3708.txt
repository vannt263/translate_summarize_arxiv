    "complex networks play a crucial role in understanding physical , biological , social and technological systems  @xcite .",
    "interactions between proteins in cells of living organisms , relations between human actors in socioeconomic contexts and connections between web pages in the world wide web can naturally be described as graphs .",
    "real - world networks typically have complex topological properties , but in spite of their evident diversity , structural analysis has revealed that they share a conspicuous set of common features : _ scale - free_ness ( _ i.e. _ , the number of connections per node following a wide or power - law distribution )  @xcite and _ small - world_ness ( _ i.e. _ , the average number of hops between two nodes in the network scales logarithmically with its size )  @xcite are two celebrated examples of such properties .",
    "recent studies have focused on deeper structural features of networks .",
    "real - world networks are typically organized in local clusters of nodes which are usually denominated communities .",
    "communities are groups of nodes with a higher level of interconnection among themselves than with the rest of the graph . in this sense",
    ", communities are groups relatively isolated from the other nodes of the network and are expected to represent elements sharing common features and/or playing similar roles within the system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an exhaustive review ) .",
    "for instance , if one considers the world wide web , communities are composed by groups of web pages dealing with similar topics ; in social networks , communities stand for sets of actors sharing common interests , ideas and friendship relationships ; in protein interaction networks , communities represent groups of proteins with similar functionalities",
    ".    this imbalance of in- and out - connections corresponds to an intuitive concept .",
    "there are some formalizations of the definition of community .",
    "the _ ls set _",
    "@xcite or _ strong community _",
    "@xcite stands for a group where every node belonging to the group has more internal connections than external ones .",
    "a less restrictive definition refers to a _ weak community _",
    "@xcite as a set of nodes where the number of intracommunity connections ( summed over all nodes within the group ) is larger than the number of links going out of the community . along these lines ,",
    "the well known _",
    "modularity _ is a quality function able to quantify the statistical importance of a partition comparing the number of internal connections observed in the communities with its expected number in a suitable _ null model _",
    "besides the formulation of a definition , big efforts have been made for the detection of communities in networks . since the total number of possible divisions of a network in subgraphs is a non - polynomial function of the size of the network itself , finding and detecting communities is not a trivial issue .",
    "many algorithms have been proposed during recent years , every of them with the same spirit of finding the best groups which maximize the internal density of links  @xcite .",
    "different principles may be used , but nevertheless in all cases some property related to the community structure is locally or globally optimized .",
    "the consequence is that even in uncorrelated networks these algorithms find clusters that are supposed to be good according to the modularity function or to other quality measures .",
    "if algorithms are able to identify communities even in random graphs , which value can we give to communities found in real networks ? or better , how to statistically determine the significance of a community ?",
    "this problem has been the subject of some studies in the literature  @xcite . in  @xcite for example ,",
    "the partition of a network maximizing the modularity is compared with the maximum modularity partition of a randomized version of the given network ( _ i.e. _ , all edges are randomly rewired ) . in  @xcite , differently , the importance of a community partition is proportional to its robustness against random perturbations ( _ i.e. _ , random reshuffling of edges ) .",
    "such heuristic approaches rely on the modularity function to evaluate the quality of a partition , which means that are subjected to the modularity resolution limits  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , all the proposed methods are designed to deal with full partitions , not with single communities . even though in a network one might find some meaningful communities alongside with randomly connected node clusters .",
    "in this paper , we develop a statistical method aimed at discriminating between a single _ bona fide _ community and structures arising as topological fluctuations . instead of a direct comparison with an average outcome",
    ", the community is confronted with the best expected result for a null - model .",
    "the reason for stressing this `` best outcome '' is that community detection algorithms will in general produce the best possible clusters given a graph , even if it is random .",
    "the threshold of significance can be approximated by using extreme and order statistics  @xcite applied to null - model community fitness .",
    "a community significance can be then obtained as the extreme probability of finding a group equal or better than the one given in a set of equivalent random graphs .",
    "has @xmath0 free ends to allocate .",
    "each of them can connect to nodes within @xmath1 or vertices belonging to the rest of the network.[fig : sketch],width=325 ]    consider a scenario as the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , with a given community @xmath1 in a graph .",
    "@xmath0 denotes the number of connections ( degree ) of the node @xmath2 .",
    "given @xmath1 , @xmath0 can be divided in two terms : @xmath3 , the number of links connecting @xmath2 to nodes in @xmath1 , and @xmath4 , the number of connections outside .",
    "similarly , we define the internal degree of @xmath1 , @xmath5 , as well as @xmath6 and its total degree @xmath7 .",
    "we consider a very simple stochastic null model : all connections inside the group are locked ( the community is given so can not be altered ) , while the other links are randomly reshuffled among all nodes preserving their degrees . for simplicity , we allow the rewiring operation to form multiple links ( two nodes can be connected by more than one edge ) or self - loops . in some weighted graphs",
    "the weights of the links are equivalent to multiple connections and so the present null - model would be appropriate .",
    "some examples are social networks ( the zachary club  @xcite , see last section ) or the _ c. elegans _ metabolic network  @xcite that will be analyzed later .",
    "for unweighted graphs , we have checked that our results do not noticeably change by including or not multiple links as long as the graph is not condensed ( a node gets a finite fraction of the links ) .",
    "when node degrees are much smaller than the network size , the probability of generating self - loops and multiple links by random reshuffling becomes negligible .",
    "note also that our null model is similar to the one used for the definition of the modularity  @xcite and close in spirit to the configurational model  @xcite .",
    "it generates graphs that have no special internal structure except that given by random fluctuations , keep the degree sequence of the original network and can show degree - degree correlations only if the degree sequence and the network size determine their presence  @xcite .",
    "this is the most general null model , appropriate when no knowledge about the system is available and simple enough to be treated from an analytical point of view . if further information regarding the constraints present in the process that generated the given network is available , other , simpler or more elaborated , null models can be employed .",
    "our method to evaluate group significance is general enough to admit the use of different null models by altering consequently the distributions that will be described next .",
    "once the null model has been selected , suppose that @xmath1 is a group composed of randomly chosen nodes and consider a generic node @xmath2 not belonging to @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath8 is given by the hypergeometric distribution @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a binomial coefficient , and @xmath11 are the free ends in the network : @xmath12 ( @xmath13 are the total ends in the graph , twice the number of links ) .",
    "( [ hypergeom ] ) states that the probability of node @xmath2 to have @xmath8 internal connections to @xmath1 is given by the ratio of two terms : the total number of ways in which @xmath8 links can be placed at the end of @xmath14 free ends multiplied by the number of ways to locate the remaining @xmath15 edges out of @xmath16 free ends , divided by the total number of ways to place all @xmath0 connections in the network ( i.e. , out of @xmath11 free ends ) .",
    "if the node @xmath2 belongs to @xmath1 , eq .",
    "( [ hypergeom ] ) has to be corrected to exclude @xmath2 from the group . when the group @xmath1 is composed of @xmath17 randomly chosen nodes , eq .",
    "( [ hypergeom ] ) recovers the results obtained via numerical simulations ( see inset fig .",
    "[ fig : hyper ] ) .     and @xmath18 for randomly generated networks of homogeneous degree .",
    "the ( black ) circles are numerical results with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the distributions refer to external nodes of groups selected at random ( inset ) or by maximizing modularity ( main plot ) . dashed ( red ) curves are the approximation given by eq .",
    "( [ hypergeom ] ) and the continuous ( blue ) one that of eq .",
    "( [ muht]).[fig : hyper],width=325 ]    the next , more interesting , case is when @xmath1 is not composed of randomly chosen nodes , but it has been detected by a clustering algorithm . as can be seen in the main plot of figure  [ fig : hyper ] , the shape of @xmath22 dramatically changes due to the algorithm node selection .",
    "most of the nodes populating the tail of the distribution are incorporated into the group .",
    "correlations are also present since nodes in the community are expected to be connected among themselves . still , it is possible to obtain an approximate expression for the probability @xmath22 .",
    "we first consider the case of homogeneous graphs where all nodes have the same degree ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) and extend later our analysis to networks with arbitrary degree sequences .",
    "we will assume that @xmath1 has been selected to maximize @xmath24 for each node inside @xmath1 as well as the overall @xmath25 .",
    "this also implies that since the nodes are all equivalent , have the same degree @xmath26 , they can be ranked according to their @xmath27 .",
    "we indicate with @xmath28 the node ( or nodes ) with the lowest @xmath27 within the community ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) . @xmath29",
    ", the internal - degree of the worst node , establishes then an upper cut - off to the possible values of @xmath27 of the out - group nodes .",
    "an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ hypergeom ] ) can then be derived for the external nodes by taking into account this new cut - off @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the term @xmath32 accounts for the fact that no node can connect to more than @xmath33 internal vertices and therefore some of the free ends @xmath11 become occupied .",
    "( [ hypergeom ] ) and ( [ muht ] ) specify the null - model .",
    "our method does not depend on the particular functional shapes of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "for instance , a more restricted null - model without multiple links can be approximated by using wallenius hypergeometric distribution , although this considerably complicates the numerical evaluation of the functions .",
    "another null - model , less realistic but very easy to implement , is the erds - rnyi - like networks for which @xmath34 and @xmath35 are binomial distributions .     for the internal degree of the worst node of the community calculated for groups @xmath1 detected by maximizing the modularity in randomly generated networks of @xmath36 ( left ) and @xmath37 ( right ) with homogeneous degree @xmath38 and for groups of @xmath39 .",
    "the black circles are the results of numerical simulation , while the continous blue curves correspond to the theoretical predictions derived from eq .",
    "( [ pkw ] ) . the extreme value distribution of @xmath22 from eq .  ( [ hypergeom ] )",
    "is also plotted for comparison ( violet dashed curve).[fig : kw],width=325 ]    the worst node within the community , @xmath28 , will play a central role in our method to evaluate group significance .",
    "we assume that in a random graph there is not a drastic variation between @xmath33 and the internal degree @xmath27 of the best nodes outside the group .",
    "postulating a smooth variation of @xmath27 between inside and outside of the community allows us to find an expression for the probability distribution of @xmath33 based on eq .",
    "( [ muht ] ) which only applies to external nodes .",
    "the degree of the worst node , @xmath33 , is a given quantity in @xmath40 . in order to find a formula for @xmath41",
    ", we need thus to alter our point of reference and consider the second worst node within the community @xmath42 .",
    "if the statistics of @xmath33 is comparable to that of the best external nodes , @xmath33 should follow the distribution of the extreme of @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the probability for @xmath33 to be lower or equal to a certain number reads @xmath44^{n - n_{\\mathcal{c}}+1 } \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the cumulative of the function @xmath46 .",
    "the distribution @xmath41 is given by the derivative of the cumulative of eq .",
    "( [ pkw ] ) , @xmath47 .",
    "it must be remarked that eq .",
    "( [ pkw ] ) is valid for independent random variables , in our null model the independence is justified for external nodes and is an approximation when refers to @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ fig : kw ] shows a comparison between the distribution @xmath41 obtained with this procedure and its counterpart from numerical simulations . despite the approximations performed to reach an analytical form for @xmath41 , the agreement is remarkable .",
    "the use of extreme statistics contributes in part to such agreement , since under very general conditions the limit extreme - value distribution is stable and has no memory of the parental distribution .",
    "once a functional form for @xmath48 was obtained , we can define a measure of the significance of a group , the @xmath1-score , as @xmath49 which corresponds to the probability that @xmath33 for an optimized community in an equivalent random graph ensemble is higher than or equal to the value seen in @xmath1 .",
    "a point to stress here is that @xmath50 contains not only information about the worst node , @xmath33 , but also about the community external links and about the degrees of the external nodes .    in order to extend our results to heterogeneous graphs ,",
    "we need to rank the nodes according to the role they play with respect to the given community @xmath1 . for regular networks ,",
    "since all the nodes are equivalent , the ranking can be simply established by considering the values of the internal degrees @xmath27 . however",
    ", another criterion is required to deal with heterogeneous networks .",
    "we use the probability distribution provided by eq .",
    "( [ hypergeom ] ) as the basis for such procedure .",
    "the rank for a node @xmath2 can be established by the probability of finding a node with an internal degree @xmath8 or higher in the null model given its degree @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "that is , for each node @xmath2 we calculate the score @xmath51 and then perform comparisons on the basis of @xmath52 .",
    "the values of @xmath52 fall in the interval @xmath53 $ ] regardless of the node degree , which facilitate the comparison . @xmath28 and @xmath42 correspond thus to the nodes with the highest and second highest values of @xmath52 within the community , respectively . under the hypothesis of a randomly connected network , the scores @xmath52 of the vertex @xmath28 , @xmath54 , and that of the external nodes can be seen as random variables uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath1-score can be then calculated as the probability of observing @xmath54 as the minimal value of a set of @xmath56 random extractions from a uniform distribution defined in the interval @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "an alternative to this last step is to map the internal degree of @xmath42 into @xmath57 ( the internal degree that it would have if its degree was equal to @xmath58 and its score @xmath59 ) by inverting the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ hypergeom ] ) .",
    "once the transformation has been performed , we can proceed in the same way as for homogeneous networks with eqs .",
    "( [ pkw ] ) and ( [ cscore ] ) .",
    "a low value of the @xmath1-score ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath60 ) is enough to consider a group as significant .",
    "however , when the @xmath1-score is higher , one could argue that the reason is that relaying only on the worst node of the community for the full group evaluation is a too severe criterion .",
    "algorithms may fail to place a single node and this would translate into a non significant community according to the @xmath1-score approach .",
    "the performance of the method can be improved by a further refinement .",
    "instead of considering only the last node , one can include a longer list of nodes and use this information for the computation of the statistical significance of the community .",
    "a way to do so is to write an algorithmic procedure .",
    "three classes of nodes can be considered : the community @xmath1 , the `` border '' @xmath61 and the rest of the network .",
    "initially , the group @xmath62 is empty and @xmath63 . then at each algorithm step",

    "this algorithm explores the interior of the community trying to maintain the worst nodes always in @xmath61 , it ends when @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 stands for the probability that the sum of the scores of the worst @xmath81 nodes of an optimized community in an ensemble of equivalent random graphs is smaller than the given for @xmath1 .",
    "its value for a set of independent random variables can be estimated by using order statistics ( see appendix  [ app ] for more details ) .",
    "we define then the @xmath61-score as @xmath82 which corresponds to the lowest value of the probability @xmath83 observed during the iterative procedure .",
    "we take the minimum as the best approximation for the significance of the group @xmath1 , since it is evaluated in the most favorable discrimination of @xmath1 nodes in border and core .",
    "this probability is equivalent to the @xmath1-score for @xmath84 , while becomes a more synergic quantity as @xmath81 increases .",

    "finding structure in graphs has direct implications for the study of several empirical disciplines as well as for a general understanding of the phenomena behind the evolution of the systems in which such structures raise .",
    "communities are the most direct and easy - to - envisage example of network structures .",
    "this concept is a direct heir of the intuitive idea of closer groups when considering social networks . as such",
    ", it has had a long history with a good number of algorithms proposed to detect communities in graphs .",
    "there are however two important issues missing in the literature . a firm mathematical definition of what a community means and a clear way to determine which of the outputs of the community detection algorithms are really significant .",
    "in this work , we have focused on the second question with the hope of giving even if partially a hint of where the answer to the first one can lay .",
    "a new measure able to statistically quantify the meaning of a single community in networks has been introduced .",
    "this measure , called @xmath1-score , represents the probability of occurrence of a group with the same properties ( i.e. , same number of nodes , nodes with the same degree sequence and same internal connections ) under the following hypothesis : ( i ) nodes in the network are randomly connected ; ( ii ) the group is chosen , among all possible groups with the same properties , because is the one which maximizes the density of internal connections .",
    "the first hypothesis is a natural assumption and a null model where links are randomly placed is very often used as term of comparison for the determination of correlations or other topological properties in networks .",
    "the latter one comes out from the common knowledge which prescribes communities as groups with high intra - connectivity .",
    "thanks to the theory of extreme statistics , we approximate the values of the @xmath1-score in the case in which our hypothesis hold . we have tested the performances of the @xmath1-score on several networks , ranging from random graphs to artificial networks with controlled community structure , or to real networks with unknown internal organization . in all cases , we have been able to find good results .",
    "the method ability of evaluating one community at a time allows to detect situations in which only some of the communities of the graph are meaningful while the rest of the groups are equivalent to random fluctuations .",
    "this approach is also flexible enough to deal with overlapping groups that share nodes between them , providing a separate evaluation for each cluster .",
    "two further refinements of the @xmath1-score have been also introduced .",
    "one with the aim of exploring the internal structure of the communities , the @xmath106-core , and another , the @xmath61-score , with the intention of evaluating a community significance based on a group of nodes instead of on the worst node of the cluster .",
    "the computational complexity of the evaluation of the @xmath61- and @xmath1-scores grows quadratically and linearly with the community size , respectively .",
    "these tools constitute a set of statistical measures for a thorough evaluation of single communities , avoiding thus the blind acceptance of the output of clustering algorithms .    the software to calculate the @xmath1-score and @xmath61-score of communities is available at  http://filrad.homelinux.org/cscore .",
    "the authors would like to warmly thank m. mungan for his contribution in the discussion that led to eq .",

    "al and jjr are funded by the eu commission projects 238597-ictecollective and 233847-dynanets , respectively .",
    "in section  [ bb ] , we have outlined how to compute the @xmath61-score of a community .",
    "the iterative procedure makes use of the probability @xmath121 which has yet to be described . during the procedure for the computation of the @xmath61-score , the size of the border",
    "is increased by one at each stage . at step @xmath81 ,",
    "the border @xmath122 is composed of the @xmath81 nodes which , on the basis of their internal degrees , are less likely to belong to @xmath123 .",
    "we have therefore a sequence of scores , @xmath124 , for the @xmath81 worst nodes .",
    "the score of the worst node , namely @xmath70 , still inside @xmath69 represents a lower bound for the sequence , since by definition we should have that @xmath125 . instead of trying to obtain the probability for the full sequence",
