    "the current paradigm to create nanoscopic devices has enhanced the interest in the changes of phase behavior and structure when fluids are confined to linear dimensions that are no longer very large compared to the particle sizes .",
    "e.g. , for a fluid ( or fluid mixture ) in a nanoscopic slit pore an interesting interplay of finite size effects , wetting or drying , and capillary condensation or evaporation  like behavior can be expected @xcite . a particularly interesting theoretical prediction @xcite concerns systems that can undergo phase separation ( a fluid separating into vapor and liquid , or a binary mixture with a miscibility gap ) confined between",
    " competing walls \" . by competing walls",
    "we mean that one wall favors one of the coexisting phases and the other wall favors the other one ( the generic model @xcite is a thin ferromagnetic ising film with oppositely oriented surface fields at both surfaces ) .",
    "when one brings the system in a state where phase separation occurs in the bulk , the thin film also exhibits phase separation , with an interface parallel to the walls in the center of the film @xcite .",
    "however , sufficiently far off from bulk criticality then a transition occurs where the interface gets localized at the wall(s ) .",
    "this transition can be of first order or of second order @xcite and in the latter case it was argued to belong to the universality class of the two  dimensional ( @xmath0 ) ising model .",
    "however , while interfaces parallel to the walls of thin films could be observed experimentally in thin films of polymer mixtures @xcite , no experimental observation of this novel type of transition has as yet been reported .",
    "indeed , the theoretical models have always invoked perfect symmetry between the two coexisting phases in the bulk ( spin reversal symmetry of the ising magnet @xcite , or strictly symmetric polymer blends @xcite , which are hard to realize in nature ) .    in the present work",
    "we show that this interface localization should also be observable in colloid  polymer mixtures , which are known to be model systems for the experimental study of phase separation @xcite and interfacial fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the large size of the colloid particles ( of the order of 1@xmath1 m ) should allow to prepare slit pores which are of the order of 10  100 particle diameters wide , with strongly repulsive walls which are essentially perfectly flat on this mesoscopic scale , modeling thus a `` hard wall '' boundary .",
    "however , coating a wall with a layer of long endgrafted flexible polymers of the same chemical type as used in the colloid  polymer mixture , one could create an additional repulsive interaction to the colloids to cancel ( partially or fully ) the depletion attraction @xcite of the colloids to the hard walls .",
    "varying the grafting density in the resulting `` polymer brush '' @xcite and/or the molecular weight of the grafted chains the range and strength of this short range repulsion between colloids and the wall could be fine  tuned , within some limits @xcite .    in the following we shall present model calculations of a simple model for colloid ",
    "polymer mixtures , the asakura  oosawa ( ao ) model @xcite , confined between two inequivalent walls : a hard wall on one side , and a hard wall plus short range repulsion acting only on the colloids on the other side .",
    "varying the strength of this repulsion we demonstrate a crossover from capillary condensation  like behavior to interface localization transitions .",
    "the colloids are modeled as hard spheres with diameter @xmath2 , the polymers are ( soft ) spheres with diameter @xmath3 .",
    "the polymers may not overlap with colloids , but there is no interaction between the polymers .",
    "recall that flexible polymers in solution form random coils with a rather large gyration radius which may interpenetrate at very low energy cost .",
    "we use a size ratio @xmath4 , since the phase diagram of this model in the bulk has been carefully studied previously @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath5 as our unit of length . when there are @xmath6 polymers and @xmath7 colloids in the considered volume @xmath8 , the polymer and colloid packing fractions are defined as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the volume is given by @xmath11 .",
    "here , @xmath12 is the width of the slit pore in @xmath13direction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in @xmath14 and @xmath15directions parallel to the walls .",
    "the @xmath16 wall at @xmath17 simply is a hard wall , while the wall at @xmath18 is described by an additional repulsive potential .",
    "it has the following form ( we absorb a factor @xmath19 here , @xmath20=boltzmann s constant , @xmath21=temperature ) : @xmath22 the strength @xmath23 of this wall ",

    "a similar behavior has been seen for asymmetric polymer mixtures studied by self ",

    "our finding implies that this non  monotonic variation is a rather general phenomenon , and it holds beyond mean field theory .",
    "in a colloid  polymer mixture confined by hard walls , depletion attraction leads to the formation of colloid  rich layers near the walls . by adding a suitable short range interaction at one of the walls ,",
    "polymers can be effectively attracted to this wall whereas the depletion attraction of colloids is reduced at it . in this case of a colloid  polymer mixture confined between asymmetric walls , our simulations demonstrate that an interface localization transition can occur .",

    "infinite colloid ",
