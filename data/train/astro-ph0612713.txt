    "measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation are now strongly constraining the viability of a variety of cosmological theories for the formation of large - scale structure . while the simplest ` vanilla ' models of single - field inflation appear sufficient to explain current data @xcite , forthcoming experiments will test this concordance further .",
    "one area in which we can expect significant improvement will be in estimates of non - gaussianity .",
    "single - field inflation predicts that variations in the cmb should follow simple gaussian statistics to high accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , more natural inflation scenarios which involve multiple fields and more complex potentials can , in principle , produce large non - gaussian signatures that may become measurable in future experiments ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . of course , the cmb power spectrum is not sensitive to these non - gaussianities so we must look to other higher order correlators .",
    "the bispectrum is the three - point correlator of the multipoles and we note that statistics based on it have been shown to be optimal for testing non - gaussianity for a variety of inflationary scenarios @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a framework for evolving the primordial bispectrum ( the bispectrum at the end of inflation ) until it leaves an observable imprint in the cmb today .",
    "current theory dictates this can be done by solving a four dimensional integral over the primordial bispectrum multiplied by six highly oscillatory functions . in practice",
    "this is not possible to evaluate numerically . in section 2",
    "we detail the current most popular approach @xcite which assumes a simple separable form for the bispectrum , so that the integral separates and becomes tractable .",
    "these methods are good for obtaining quick estimates but their applicability is limited by their ability to fit a suitable analytic approximation for the shape of the primordial bispectrum . in section 3 , we detail a different more general approach .",
    "as the primordial bispectrum is the most important ingredient in the calculation , we place no restrictions on it other than an overall separable scale dependence .",
    "from here we reduce the four - dimensional integral to a two - dimensional integral over the primordial bispectrum multiplied by two one - dimensional integrals , one model dependent and one purely geometric .    in section 4 ,",
    "we investigate analytic solutions for the bispectrum .",
    "there are two asymptotic categories for the shape function  `` local '' and `` equilateral ''  depending on whether the non - gaussianity is created primarily on superhorizon scales or at horizon - crossing , respectively . in the large angle approximation and for the simplest form of the local bispectrum",
    ", there exists an exact solution which can be used to test the accuracy of our numerical methods . while there is no similar solution for the equilateral scenario",
    ", we argue that our methods should be more precise in this case .",
    "we have developed code that will accurately evolve the bispectrum from the end of inflation until today , evaluating its angular counterpart in the cmb .",
    "note that our primary focus here is on the effect of primordial non - gaussianity on the cmb , so it suffices to use linear radiation transfer functions for this purpose . in section 5",
    ", we detail the inner workings of the code and point out the key innovations required to compute the integral quickly and accurately .",
    "in section 6 , we test against the local analytic solution and demonstrate an accuracy of less than 1% for multipole values less than @xmath1 ( using the idealized large angle transfer function ) .",
    "we also study the bispectrum for the equilateral case and find it has better convergence with an error of less than 1% for @xmath2 values , @xmath3 . with the correct radiation transfer functions used at small angles",
    ", we find that calculations of the full cmb bispectrum are numerically tractable at large @xmath2 and that the errors remain below 1% out to multipoles @xmath0 .",
    "we show that growing errors for even larger @xmath2 are linked directly to the resolution and the asymptotic cut - offs employed .",
    "if the parameters governing these are tightened , arbitrary accuracy can be achieved though at some computational cost .",
    "we provide plots of the cmb bispectrum for the full radiation transfer function for both the local and equilateral cases , showing oscillatory behaviour analogous to the angular power spectrum .",
    "having established the accuracy and efficiency of these methods , we detail future directions for this work in section 7 .",
    "we will quickly review the calculation for the bispectrum today from a given primordial bispectrum , this section loosely follows the derivation in @xcite .",
    "the temperature fluctuations in the cmb can be decomposed into spherical harmonics , @xmath4 ( ) = _ l m a_lm y_lm ( ) .",

    "this area can be parametrised into slices represented by the green triangle and the distance @xmath43 of the centre of the triangle from the origin.,height=230 ]    the end result is that we have broken up the four - dimensional integral for the reduced bispectrum ( [ redbispectrum ] ) into a two - dimensional integral ( [ biint2 ] ) , restricted to an equilateral triangle , over the scale - independent shape multiplied by two one - dimensional integrals ( [ transferint])([geometricint ] ) .",
    "the first @xmath64 is over the transfer functions and the second is purely geometric @xmath65 .",
    "these two one - dimensional integrands consist entirely of highly oscillatory functions .",
    "however , as we shall discuss later , since they are only one - dimensional it is feasible to evaluate them accurately numerically , freeing us from the severe difficulties previously encountered .",
    "the two basic asymptotic limits ( local and equilateral ) for the scale - independent shape can be approximated by the analytic expressions @xcite : [ ansatze ] f^si_local(a , b , c ) = + f^si_equilateral(a , b , c ) = .",
    "we have plotted these two bispectrum shapes in figure [ primbisp ] .",
    "while much emphasis has been placed on these two limits , we note in passing the caveat that even single - field inflation yields a more complicated non - gaussian shape @xcite .    [",

    "with the numerical methods we have developed it is now possible to accurately calculate the cmb bispectrum today from a general shape function . in the stringent test case",
    "there is a problem obtaining accuracy without long calculation times because of truncation errors , but arbitrary accuracy can be achieved by altering truncation thresholds and improving resolution . in the real calculation using the full radiation transfer function",
    "we have demonstrated that the systematic error sources are much weaker and very accurate results can be obtained rapidly using our adaptive method .",
    "we find that the bispectra for the local and equilateral cases are broadly similar in the equal multipole case , with the main difference being that the equilateral case is smaller at low @xmath2 . where the two cases differ significantly is in the slices @xmath66 ( and for which we find no significant new sources of error ) . for the calculation with the full radiation transfer functions , we find that the results are much the same in the centre , but with the equilateral case more heavily suppressed where the @xmath2 values differ significantly , as expected .",
    "this indicates that the equal multipole bispectrum provides a good measure of the overall size of the non - gaussianity , while the unequal @xmath2 bispectrum provides a differentiator between competing models .",
    "obviously , meaningful plots of the cmb bispectrum ( like figure [ slices ] ) are not expected to be determined observationally , not least because they will be dominated by noise and convolved with experimental beams .",
    "instead we must use an estimator to determine the fit of theory to observation .    while a parallel implementation of the code runs sufficiently rapidly on a supercomputer for calculations of the full bispectrum",
    ", there is still plenty of scope for further improvements .",
    "essentially all of the calculation time is spent evaluating the one - dimensional integrals with the geometric integral taking twice as long as the transfer integral . to reduce overall evaluation times",
    "we then have two options .",
    "we can improve the integration methods for the one - dimensional integrals or we can reduce the number of points we need to calculate by improving the adaptive algorithm . improving the cell selection criteria in the adaptive algorithm has largely been a long process of trial and error , and no doubt this can be continued with further success .",
    "however , improving the one - dimensional integration method is perhaps the more exciting option . here ,",
    "more rapidly convergent numerical methods are possible , but the hope is that for the case of the geometric integral we may be able to switch to an analytic solution should a stable method of evaluation be discovered . such an advance could reduce overall bispectrum calculation times by a factor of 3 .",
    "the decomposition of the bispectrum into legendre polynomials has also been parallelised but is still hampered but the requirement to use a large number of polynomials .",
    "this arises from having to perform the integral over the cube in l space with sides from @xmath67 to @xmath68 while the bispectrum is only defined inside the tetrahedron created by the triangle condition on the @xmath2 s .",
    "when we use the code to calculate points outside this tetrahedron we introduce discontinuities which require a large number of polynomials to fit accurately .",
    "we are currently looking to edit the code to calculate these points so that the bispectrum remains smooth as we cross the boundary .",
    "the present code has been developed in modular form to link and work together with existing cmb line - of - sight codes for the angular power spectrum ( like cmbfast , camb or cmb2000 ) ; it extracts the appropriate radiation transfer functions from these for a given cosmology .",
    "in due course , it is our intention to improve the efficiency , portability and parallelism ( as well as the documentation ) of this code and to make it publicly available .",
    "the bispectrum remains a highly significant tool for testing for non - gaussianity in the cmb .",
    "hopefully , future experiments like the planck satellite will either detect or provide much tighter constraints on this non - gaussianity , opening a new window on the early universe . with this code",
    "we now have the capability to make accurate predictions for the contributions to the cmb bispectrum which are of primordial origin .",
    "for example , we plan to use quantitative bispectra from multifield inflation models @xcite and project these forward to make falsifiable cmb predictions .",
    "clearly parallel efforts must also continue in order to pin down and distinguish alternative sources of cmb non - gaussianity from later times , such as second - order effects in the radiation transfer functions and nonlinear astrophysical effects .",
    "we are especially grateful to kendrick smith for conversations regarding the decomposition of the reduced bispectrum into polynomials and the subsequent method for calculating the estimator .",

    "<S> we present a new formalism , together with efficient numerical methods , to directly calculate the cmb bispectrum today from a given primordial bispectrum using the full linear radiation transfer functions . </S>",
    "<S> unlike previous analyses which have assumed simple separable anstze for the bispectrum , this work applies to a primordial bispectrum of almost arbitrary functional form , for which there may have been both horizon - crossing and superhorizon contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we employ adaptive methods on a hierarchical triangular grid and we establish their accuracy by direct comparison with an exact analytic solution , valid on large angular scales . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that we can calculate the full cmb bispectrum to greater than 1% precision out to multipoles @xmath0 on reasonable computational timescales . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the bispectrum for both the superhorizon ( ` local ' ) and horizon - crossing ( ` equilateral ' ) asymptotic limits , illustrating its oscillatory nature which is analogous to the cmb power spectrum . </S>"
