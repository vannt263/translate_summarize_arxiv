    "since the last few years , identifying the symmetry of the pairing state has been the expected major step towards an understanding of high @xmath14 superconductivity .",
    "the controversy is not yet resolved : while there seems to be an agreement on the existence of nodes in the gap , some experiments appear to advocate in favor of a pure @xmath12 symmetry @xcite , whereas others seem to exhibit a significant s - wave contribution @xcite . with respect to this problem",
    ", inelastic light scattering has been shown very early to be a powerful tool because , besides probing the bulk ( in contrast with photoemission and tunneling ) , the polarization selection rules on the incident and scattered light make the spectra sensitive to the wave - vector of the electronic excitations @xcite .",
    "a theoretical approach of electronic raman scattering has been developed , in the case of @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "the emphasis is put on the low energy spectrum , which is expected in this case to exhibit well defined power laws , according to the symmetry channel , e.g. the polarization of the incoming and outgoing light .",
    "more precisely , the so - called @xmath8 and @xmath15 symmetry should display a linear dependence versus frequency , as these channels are sensitive to the nodes in the @xmath16 direction , whereas the @xmath9 symmetry probes mainly directions around the @xmath17 @xmath18 directions and should display a @xmath19 frequency dependence @xcite .",
    "such calculations omit other excitations such as phonons .",
    "the experimental major difficulty lies then in the fact that in most investigated compounds , e.g. @xmath20 @xmath21 ( y-123 ) , @xmath22 ( bi-2212 ) and @xmath23 ( tl-2201 ) , a large phonon contribution is superimposed to the electronic excitations in particular at low frequency and has therefore to be subtracted , which precludes an accurate determination of the shape of the electronic contribution in the superconducting state @xcite . despite this difficulty , in a number of reports ,",
    "a satisfactory agreement is claimed to be found between the electronic response obtained after subtraction of the phonon lines , and the @xmath12 model @xcite    in this work , we report _ pure _ electronic raman spectra in @xmath0 ( hg-1223 ) single crystals , belonging to the highest @xmath14 cuprate family .",
    "this provides a large spectral range below the superconducting gap frequency where the low energy electronic spectrum can be analyzed .",
    "moreover , within this range , no subtraction of the phonons is required to discuss the electronic response @xcite . indeed , as shown in our previous work [ 16 - 18 ] , the very low intensity of the raman phonon peaks for electric fields within the @xmath24 planes allows a reliable analysis of the electronic excitations in the superconducting state .",
    "the crystallographic structure of hg-1223 is tetragonal ( @xmath25 ) @xcite , which yields an unambiguous comparison with theoretical calculations based on tetragonal symmetry , without the complications due to the orthorhombic distortion as in y-123 @xcite .",
    "hg-1223 is therefore particularly well suited for the study of the electronic raman scattering .",
    "our most striking results are i ) the existence of two electronic maxima at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , both detected in @xmath28 symmetry .",
    "these two maxima disappear at @xmath14 .",
    "ii ) the low frequency behavior of the @xmath29 spectrum displays what we believe to be an intrinsic linear term , which is observed for all excitation energies used in this work ( 476.5 - 647.1 nm spectral range ) .",
    "such observations imply that the gap is strongly anisotropic with two distinct maxima and that nodes exist outside the [ 110 ] and [ 1,@xmath13,0 ] directions .",
    "we argue that our results , which are at odds with a pure @xmath12 gap symmetry , imply an order parameter with two maximum gap values and eight nodes .",
    "we briefly recall the standard theoretical framework for electronic raman scattering which we will use in the analysis of our experimental results @xcite .",
    "electronic raman scattering is a process of inelastic light scattering where an incident photon is absorbed by the crystal and a scattered one is emitted , with the simultaneous creation ( stokes ) or annihilation ( anti - stokes ) of an electronic excitation . here",
    "we will only have to deal with stokes processes .",
    "since two photons are coming into play , raman scattering is a second order process in the electromagnetic field .",
    "this second order effective interaction with electronic excitations comes both from a direct second order term in the interaction hamiltonian , and from a first order term treated up to second order in perturbation . as introduced by abrikosov and genkin @xcite",
    ", one may consider that both terms can be gathered in a single effective second order term in the hamiltonian which can be written as : @xmath30 where e is the electronic charge and m its bare mass . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the vector potentials of the incoming laser and scattered light , and the bracket is for the proper matrix element over the photons states . the difference between the incident and the scattered photon frequencies",
    "is noted @xmath33 , and the difference between the photon momenta is @xmath34 .",
    "the operator @xmath35 is given by : @xmath36 it is quite similar to the standard density operator , the only difference being the @xmath37 for the scattering process , known as the raman vertex , which is given explicitely by : @xmath38   & & + { 1 \\over \\hbar m}\\sum\\nolimits\\limits_{{n}_{m}}^ { } { \\left\\langle{{\\rm n}_{f},\\bf k\\rm + \\bf q\\rm   \\left|{{e}^{-i{\\bf k}_{\\rm s}.\\bf r}\\rm { \\bf e}_{\\rm s}.\\bf p}\\right|{\\rm n}_{m},\\bf k\\rm + { \\bf k}_{l}}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle{{\\rm n}_{m},\\bf k\\rm + { \\bf k}_{l}\\rm \\left|{{e}^{i{\\bf k}_{\\rm l}.\\bf r}\\rm { \\bf e}_{\\rm l}.\\bf p}\\right|{\\rm n}_{i},\\bf k}\\right\\rangle \\over { \\rm \\varepsilon } _ { { n}_{i},\\bf k}\\rm -{\\varepsilon } _ { { n}_{m},\\bf k\\rm + { \\bf k}_{l}}\\rm + { \\omega } _ { l}+i\\eta } + ( l\\leftrightarrow s ) \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is quite important that this raman vertex has a @xmath39-dependence , otherwise electronic raman scattering would essentially vanish , for symmetry reasons in @xmath29 and @xmath40 symmetry , and because of screening in @xmath28 symmetry .",
    "the interest of the reduced form in eq.(2 ) is that we have to deal only with electrons in a single band . in particular when the photon energies @xmath41 and @xmath42 are neglected in the denominator of eq.(3 ) , it can be shown that the raman vertex is identical to the contraction of the @xmath43 -dependent inverse effective mass tensor of this band with the polarization vectors of the incident and the scattered light .",
    "this latter reduced formula is sometimes used to make explicit calculations of the raman vertex from an assumed knowledge of the band structure . in general a single band",
    "is assumed at the fermi level .",
    "it is not obvious at all that this is reasonable in high @xmath44 compounds , although one may argue that the raman process is dominated by a single band ( this is strongly suggested by the similarity of electronic raman scattering between various high-@xmath44 superconductors ) .",
    "moreover the effective mass formula assumes that the energy of all the states belonging to other bands are far enough from the fermi level in order to neglect the photon energies in the denominator .",
    "while this approximation is reasonable for simple metals ( one band is near the fermi level and the other bands are far away ) , it appears much more doubtful in high-@xmath44 superconductors .",
    "in particular it is known that the absorption is important at the incident frequency , linked to interband transitions .",
    "this invalidates the approximation of neglecting the photon energies and implies instead the existence of resonant terms .",
    "this is actually coherent with what we observe experimentally , since the electronic raman scattering varies in an important way as a function of the incident photon energy ( as we will see in section v.2 ) .",
    "moreover , in order to deal consistently with these quasi - resonant terms , we have to take into account the finite lifetime of the highly excited intermediate states .",
    "we expect , on the basis of optical data , that this relaxation rate is large , of order of a few tenths of ev .",
    "all this makes it clear that the effective mass approximation is not valid in our experimental situation .",
    "therefore we will rather consider that the raman vertex is actually an effective quantity which depends not only on the wavevector @xmath45 , but also on the incident and scattered photon energies . for simplicity we will not indicate explicitly this dependence in the following , but we will consider it in the analysis of our data .",
    "the differential cross section is then obtained in terms of the generalized susceptibility @xmath46 corresponding to the generalized density eq.(2 ) .",
    "it is related to the imaginary part @xmath47 of this susceptibility by : @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the standard procedure is then to calculate @xmath50 in the superconducting state within the single bubble approximation .",
    "moreover it is appropriate to neglect the momentum transfer @xmath51 because it is small compared to the inverse coherence length and almost perpendicular to the @xmath24 planes .",
    "one finds then within bcs theory and in the limit of low temperature @xmath52 , which is relevant for our experiments @xcite : @xmath53 @xmath54 is the density of states for both spin orientations at the fermi level , and the brackets indicate an average over the fermi surface .",
    "@xmath55 stands for the superconducting , @xmath45-dependent gap . for our purpose eq.(5 ) has two related major drawbacks .",
    "first it leads to a vanishing raman scattering in the limit of large frequency , where we should recover the physical properties of the normal state .",
    "it also leads in general to a singular behavior in the vicinity of the thresholds for creation of a pair of excitations , which occurs at twice the maxima of the gap @xmath55 .",
    "this is in contrast with our experimental results .",
    "as we will see , we obtain smooth spectral shapes , and , in the high frequency regime , we recover a strong raman scattering , which is well known in the normal state . these two discrepancies between experiment and theory can be ascribed to the fact that no collisional damping of any kind is included in the process of deriving eq.(5 ) .",
    "nevertheless this is not so important here since our purpose is much more to make a qualitative analysis of our results than to provide a full quantitative account of experiment .",
    "however it is clear that inclusion of lifetime effects in the theory is quite desirable to provide a more accurate account of experimental results .",
    "work in this direction is in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "finally there is a physical effect , essential for a proper analysis of raman scattering , which we have not included up to now . indeed",
    "if we had a constant raman vertex , we would merely look for a density - density response . as pointed out already by wolff @xcite , perfect screening in metals at long wavelength implies that in this case raman scattering would be essentially zero .",
    "therefore it is necessary to include screening by the coulomb interaction in order to obtain a proper physical result . in the limit of perfect screening ,",
    "the result is : @xmath56 \\label{eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is defined by : @xmath58 here @xmath59 and @xmath60 are general vertices , 1 being the proper vertex for a true density interaction ( this comes in eq.(6 ) because only this true density is screened by coulomb interaction ) . in @xmath9 and @xmath15 symmetry , @xmath61 is zero for symmetry reasons , the last term in eq.(6 ) drops out and we merely recover eq.(5 ) . in other words , the @xmath9 and @xmath15 symmetry are not screened because the average effective density is zero in these cases .",
    "on the other hand this is not so for the @xmath8 symmetry , and screening has to be properly taken into account by making use of eq.(6 ) .",
    "nevertheless one sees easily from this equation that any * k*-independent contribution to the raman vertex drops out of the result .",
    "physically such a contribution is irrelevant because it is fully screened out .",
    "the measurements were carried on two single crystals labelled a and b. these crystals were grown by a single step synthesis as previously described for hg-1223 @xcite .",
    "they are parallelepipeds with typical 0.5 x 0.5 @xmath62 cross section and thickness 0.3 mm .",
    "the [ 100 ] crystallographic direction lies at @xmath63 of the edge of the square and the [ 001 ] direction is normal to the surface .",
    "they were characterized by x - ray diffraction and wave length dispersive spectrometry @xcite .",
    "identification of the proper phase requires several experimental characterization techniques , and one may be easily mislead in particular by the critical temperature .",
    "the presence of intergrowth phases , corresponding to different stacking numbers of the @xmath64 planes along the _",
    "c_-axis has been established @xcite .",
    "this was detected through : i ) the presence of diffusion streaks in the oscillation photographs , ii ) the lattice parameter values obtained from an enraf - nonius cad-4 diffractometer at 293 k , iii ) the chemical analysis carried out using a camebax sx50 electron probe .",
    "the electron beam probes 1 @xmath65 of material at each measurement ( the probed depth is approximatively 10 times the penetration depth of the excitation light ) .",
    "20 measurements were performed for the a crystal and 40 for the b crystal .",
    "the a crystal exhibits an overall composition of @xmath66 the under - stoechiometry in ca and cu can be assigned to the existence of hg-1212 intergrowth phase .",
    "the b crystal has the following composition : @xmath67 which reveals a mixture of hg-1223 and hg-1234 .",
    "a detailed x - ray analysis has been performed on the a crystal .",
    "the lattice parameters deduced from the diffractometer are a=3.844(2)@xmath68 and c=15.72(3)@xmath68 , hence the c parameter of this crystal is slightly smaller than the perfectly stoechiometric hg-1223 ( c=15.831  ) and definitely much larger than c=12.71@xmath69 for hg-1212 .",
    "therefore , according to the composition and the lattice parameters and in agreement with the chemical probe , we may consider that we are dealing essentially with the hg-1223 compound in both a and b crystals .",
    "the crystals are slightly under - doped , with @xmath70 less than 0.1 .",
    "@xmath70 refers to an excess of oxygen atoms randomly arranged within the hg planes . under - doping",
    "is further confirmed by dc magnetization measurements displayed in fig.1 .",
    "although there is an onset of diamagnetism around 133 k , it appears that the main transition occurs at @xmath71 optimal doping increases @xmath72 hence introduces disorder in the hg basal plane .",
    "therefore an under - doped system is closer to four - fold symmetry than an optimally doped one and is even more appropriate to symmetry considerations .",
    "finally we wish to point out that the extensive study of the crystal structure described above had not been completed for all the samples ( coming from a single batch ) by the time of our earlier work @xcite .",
    "one crystal was clearly identified as hg-1212 , and we eventually published the better quality spectra from another one , unaware of the fact , which is established by now , that two crystals coming from the same batch may be either hg-1212 or hg-1223 .",
    "the latter sample was subsequently analyzed and turned out to be , as explained above , hg-1223 .",
    "it is important to quote that actually the raman spectra of the two samples studied in @xcite were similar .",
    "this will be shown in the experimental results .",
    "raman measurements were performed with a double monochromator using a single channel detection and the @xmath73 and @xmath74 laser lines .",
    "the spectral resolution was set at 3 @xmath75 the crystals were mounted in vacuum @xmath76 mbar ) on the cold finger of a liquid helium flow cryostat .",
    "the temperature was controlled by a si diode located inside the cold finger .",
    "the incident laser spot is less than 100 @xmath77 in diameter and the intensity onto the crystal surface was kept below @xmath78 in order to avoid heating . at our lowest temperature ,",
    "the difference in temperature between the cooled face and the illuminated face of the crystals was estimated to be @xmath79 1 k , resulting in a temperature of 13 k inside the scattering volume , instead of a nominal 12 k temperature .",
    "the incidence angle was @xmath80 .",
    "the scattered light was collected along the normal to the crystal surface .",
    "the polarization is denoted in the usual way : x[100 ] ( a axis ) , y[010 ] , z[001 ] ( c axis ) , x[110 ] , y[1@xmath130 ] . in order to compare our experimental data with the theoretical calculations [ 6,22 ] ,",
    "the pure @xmath15 ( xy ) and @xmath9 ( xy ) symmetries are convenient and well suited for the investigation of a @xmath12 order parameter . to make this point clear",
    ", we recall briefly the symmetry properties : in the @xmath81 case , the raman vertex @xmath82 is zero by symmetry for @xmath83 , so the electronic scattering is insensitive to the gap structure around @xmath63 ; in contrast , the @xmath84 and @xmath85 regions do contribute , giving weight to the gap @xmath86 in these directions .",
    "conversely , in the @xmath2 case , the raman vertex @xmath82 is zero by symmetry for @xmath84 or @xmath85 or and non zero elsewhere , hence provides weight in the @xmath83 direction .    in our experimental procedure , we start by measuring the @xmath1 channel . the incident angle being not zero , the crystal is then rotated by @xmath63 in order to get the @xmath2 one , the polarizer and the analyzer remaining unchanged ( see fig . 2-a and 2-b ) .",
    "the @xmath87 and @xmath88 symmetries are obtained from the ( xx ) and ( xx ) polarizations respectively . in order to probe the same area for all symmetries ,",
    "the impact of the laser beam onto the crystal surface was precisely located before turning the crystal .",
    "finally , a very weak diffusive spot was carefully selected on each crystal in order to minimize the amount of spurious elastic scattering .",
    "another possibility which guarantees that the location of the laser spot is unchanged for @xmath1 and @xmath2 symmetries , is to rotate the polarization instead of the crystal ( see fig .",
    "2-c ) , when starting from pure @xmath9 symmetry . after a @xmath63 rotation",
    ", the incident electric field no longer lies within the xy plane , which induces symmetry mixing for @xmath89 we have estimated the amount of mixing with @xmath87 ( xx ) and @xmath90 ( xz ) , taking into account the high refractive index @xmath91 which brings the propagation of the beam inside the crystal closer to normal incidence ; we found @xmath92 admixture of @xmath87 ( xx ) and @xmath93 of @xmath90 ( xz ) .",
    "we shall denote this mixed symmetry as @xmath94 .",
    "similarly , we can measure the @xmath95 channel ( bringing the analyzer parallel to the polarizer ) , which comprises besides the @xmath87 spectrum , @xmath92 of @xmath2 ( xy ) and @xmath93 of @xmath90 ( xz ) .    to get a complete set of reliable data ,",
    "we have performed raman measurements in both configurations : i ) rotation of the crystal without changing the polarization , so as to get pure @xmath1 and @xmath2 symmetries and ii ) rotation of the polarization without moving the crystal , in order to work with the same spot .",
    "various spots have been probed on each crystal .",
    "all the resulting data are consistent one with the other .",
    "the hg-1223 raw spectra at 13 k , in the three symmetries obtained with the 514.52 nm laser line by rotating the crystal are displayed in fig .",
    "these pure @xmath96 @xmath9 and @xmath15 spectra were previously reported in ref @xcite .",
    "figure 3-b shows the spectra obtained by rotating the polarization , yielding the @xmath95 and @xmath94 mixed symmetries .",
    "the two procedures ( performed in the same a crystal ) yield similar results for each symmetry although there is some extra scattered intensity in the mixed @xmath95 symmetry at high energy . since several spots have been selected , this crossed procedure confirms the reliability of the data .",
    "note that due to the high surface quality of the hg-1223 crystal , the residual elastic scattering is confined below 50 @xmath97 and is quite weak . in crossed polarization measurements @xmath98 and @xmath99 this scattering is just not seen , hence no correction has been performed to take it into account .",
    "the @xmath88 spectrum obtained from the b crystal , is displayed in fig.4 .",
    "for the sake of the comparison , we show in fig.5 preliminary raw spectra from hg-1212 .",
    "the surface quality being not so good for this sample , we see clearly , especially in the @xmath8 symmetry , the rayleigh scattering",
    ". nevertheless , these results are suggestive of a very strong similarity of the raman response in both compounds .",
    "let us focus on fig . 3 and 4 . remarkably and in sharp contrast with y-123 and bi-2212 , we get a large spectral range below the energy gap where no raman active phonon mode hinders the @xmath1 and @xmath2 electronic scattering analysis .",
    "weak and narrow peaks appear at 240 , 388 , 480 and 580 @xmath100 in the @xmath87 and @xmath88 but their energy location and their intensity are such that no correction is actually needed to discuss the electronic spectra .",
    "the 580 @xmath100 peak shows a phonon asymmetric lineshape with an antiresonance on the high energy side ( see fig.3-a ) .",
    "this is characteristic of the interference between an electronic continuum and a single phonon state .",
    "this fano lineshape has already been detected in y-123 and bi-2212 for the @xmath1 normal mode in the vicinity of the gap structure maximum [ 7,10,23 ] .",
    "the 640 @xmath100 peak detected in fig.4 is assigned to some trace of @xmath101 impurity @xcite .",
    "overall , the spectra do not require the delicate handling of  phonon subtraction  and we are in a position to turn immediately to the analysis of the data .",
    "two well marked maxima are observed : one is located around 530 @xmath100 in the @xmath87 ( fig.3-a ) , @xmath102 ( fig.4 ) symmetries and the @xmath95 ( fig.3-b ) mixed symmetry ; the other is observed at 800 @xmath100 in the @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "in contrast , no clear maximum appears in the @xmath2 and the mixed @xmath94 symmetries , for which actually the scattered intensity levels out smoothly around 530 @xmath75    in the @xmath87 spectrum ( fig.3-a ) , we observe a weak shoulder near 800 @xmath97 not seen in the mixed @xmath103 symmetry ( fig.3-b ) . in the @xmath88 spectrum ( fig.4),beyond",
    "the well defined maximum at 530 @xmath97 a broad maximum is clearly visible at 800 @xmath75 there is in the latter case no possible contamination by the @xmath9 channel , whereas the @xmath15 channel does not display any feature above 500 @xmath75 all this strongly suggests that the 800 @xmath100 maximum is an intrinsic electronic feature in the @xmath8 channel .",
    "this important point will be discussed later .",
    "the observation of two electronic maxima below @xmath10 is currently mentioned for two distinct channels [ 7 - 9 , 13 ] .",
    "it is a common feature for numerous high-@xmath10 cuprates studied by raman spectroscopy near the optimally doped regime .",
    "the lower energy peak @xmath104 is usually observed in @xmath87 symmetries and the higher energy one @xmath105 is detected in pure @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the energies of these two peaks for various cuprates are listed in table i. two well defined energy scales appear : ( 5 @xmath106 and @xmath107 remarkably enough , their ratio is approximatively 1.5 , whatever the compound .",
    "what is new in our study is that , by looking at a less commonly studied symmetry channel , we find that these two energy scales are present within one single channel , namely @xmath108    finally , the temperature dependence of the imaginary parts of the electronic response for the @xmath109 and @xmath9 symmetry as a function of the temperature from 13 k to 150 k is shown in fig.6-a and 6-b respectively .",
    "the imaginary part of the electronic response function @xmath110 $ ] is derived by subtracting the photomultiplier dark current , the rayleigh scattering intensity , when present , and by correcting for the response of the diffraction grating and for the bose - einstein factor @xmath111^{-1}. $ ] in both symmetries , the low energy scattered intensity increases , approaching that of the normal state as the temperature is raised .",
    "the maxima at 540 @xmath112 ( for @xmath113 @xmath114 and 800 @xmath100 ( for @xmath115 gradually collapse and disappear above @xmath11 these two maxima do not shift significantly ( at most 10% ) towards low energies as the temperature increases . the latter result is fairly general in raman and tunneling experiments .",
    "we wish now to concentrate on the low energy part of the spectra .",
    "we collect in fig .",
    "7 the imaginary parts of the electronic response functions @xmath116 $ ] obtained from the raw data after performing the same corrections described just above , associated to the @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath2 symmetries , already reported in @xcite .",
    "the dotted lines represent @xmath119 , $ ] after smoothing the spectra ( for clarity ) .",
    "as could be inferred from the raw spectra , the three response functions seem to extrapolate to zero at zero frequency , within our experimental accuracy .",
    "we recall @xcite the main observations which emerge from fig .",
    "7 , namely :    \\i ) the @xmath1 response function exhibits a clear decrease of the electronic scattering at low energy in the superconducting state with respect to the normal state . in contrast , the @xmath87 and @xmath2 response functions decrease barely at low energy .",
    "actually , there is very little change between the normal and the superconducting state in the @xmath15 channel .",
    "the change is instead much larger in the @xmath8 channel but occurs around the peak energy .",
    "\\ii ) the @xmath1 spectrum exhibits a steady quasi - linear increase with energy , in contrast with bi-2212 spectra where , after subtracting the phonon contribution , the spectrum below the peak energy exhibits a strong upward curvature @xcite .",
    "\\iii ) the electronic response functions in the normal and superconducting state merge in all three symmetries around 1000 @xmath75    to investigate further the low energy behavior of the @xmath9 spectrum in the superconducting state , we have performed raman measurements at t=13 k with various excitations lines .",
    "the imaginary parts of the electronic response functions in the @xmath1 symmetry are displayed in fig .",
    "8-a for five different excitation lines , namely 647.1 , 568.2 , 514.52 , 488.0 and 476.5 nm .",
    "for clarity , the spectra have been normalized so as to achieve the same intensity around the 800 @xmath100 maximum and shifted vertically .",
    "the spectra reported here have been taken from sample b. there is a clear change in the overall shape of electronic response as the excitation energy decreases .",
    "a simple visual inspection of the spectra suggests that they can be classified in two categories : for the 647.1 and 568.2 nm lines , the linear part appears to extend up to higher energy than for the 514.52 , 488.0 and 476.5 nm excitation lines .",
    "also the maximum for the two former ones seems to develop at a somewhat lower energy . in order to confirm the occurrence of two sets of data displaying a similar spectral dependence , we have firstly checked quantitatively that within the two sets , the spectra are indeed proportional .",
    "then , we have used this calculation to normalize the spectra for the two lower energy excitation lines ( 647.1 and 568.2 nm ) on one hand , and for the three higher energy excitation lines ( 514.52 , 488.0 and 476.5 nm ) on the other hand .",
    "the result is shown in fig.8-b .",
    "indeed , within each set , the higher excitation energy spectra and the lower ones fall exactly one on top of the other , within our experimental resolution .",
    "as mentioned in section ii , a source of complication of the analysis may arise from the dependence of the raman vertex on @xmath120 and @xmath121 the dependence on @xmath120 is revealed in our experiments as a change in the strength of the raman scattering with the laser frequency .",
    "the dependence on @xmath122 translates into a dependence on the raman shift @xmath123 which could affect the validity of the low frequency analysis .",
    "let us first comment on the possible origin of the @xmath124 dependence .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the spectral range of interest ( 15000 - 22000 @xmath125 various cuprates ( ybco , lasrcuo , bisrycuo ) exhibit two bands , located typically around 12000 - 14000 @xmath100 ( the so - called charge - transfer band ) , and 22000 @xmath100 [ 25 - 28 ] . since , to the best of our knowledge , similar spectra are not yet available for the hg compounds , we assume that the absorption bands lie in the same range as for other cuprates .",
    "the three high energy excitation lines are clearly located in the absorption range of the high energy band . the 568.2 nm line",
    "( 17600 @xmath126 actually lies in - between the two bands , still closer to the charge transfer band , and the raman spectrum exhibits a strong similarity with the 647.1 nm ( 15450 @xmath126 one .",
    "the latter is definitely in the vicinity of the charge transfer band .",
    "therefore , the change of the raman spectra with the excitation energy bears an actual consistency with the absorption bands in the visible range , supporting the idea that resonant scatttering is effective .",
    "it is not very surprising that we find within our experimental resolution , that the data can be separated into two sets , since two bands seem to be involved .",
    "the question which is raised once this is recognized is which frequency range is most affected by the change of the raman vertex with energy .",
    "when fitting the absorption bands to lorentz oscillators @xcite , we found typical widths of 1ev",
    ". a typical energy scale for the variation of the raman vertex with @xmath127 would then be 0.5 - 1ev .",
    "a first order expansion of the raman vertex ( we omit the @xmath43 dependence of @xmath128 for simplicity ) with respect to the laser frequency writes : @xmath129 therefore in the limit @xmath130 , which is of interest here , the raman vertex is independent of @xmath131 which implies that the low frequency behavior should not depend on the laser excitation energy . as @xmath132 increases , the frequency dependence of @xmath133 may not be neglected . using this line of reasoning ,",
    "we have compared the low frequency dependence of the two sets of spectra obtained by varying the laser excitation . a simple way to do it is to select from each set the spectrum exhibiting the best signal to noise ratio , namely the ones associated to the 568.2 and the 514.5 nm lines .",
    "9 shows that indeed , the low frequency dependence ( up to 500 @xmath126 is the same , and that the spectra gradually separate as the frequency increases .",
    "we assign this behavior to the change of the raman vertex with frequency , as explained above .",
    "therefore , we shall consider henceforward that there is no change of the low frequency behavior when changing the excitation energy .",
    "note incidentally the strong linear term of the @xmath9 spectrum , best seen in fig.9 .",
    "we may now turn to the comparison of our data with existing theories .",
    "we start with the @xmath12 model , as computed by devereaux et al . , which was found to describe well the bi-2212 results @xcite . in a pure @xmath12 model , symmetry considerations imply that the @xmath1 spectrum is insensitive to the nodes at @xmath63 ( hence the @xmath19 dependence ) and displays a maximum at @xmath134 , whereas the @xmath2 symmetry exhibits a linear low frequency dependence ( because it probes the nodes ) and a smeared gap @xcite . for the same reason the @xmath3 symmetry has also a linear low @xmath132 behaviour .",
    "we find a fair agreement of this model with our data for the linear dependence of the low energy part of the @xmath2 symmetry ( see fig .",
    "our linear @xmath3 spectrum agrees also quite well with the prediction of the @xmath12 model at low frequency , but this is not the case for the higher frequency range [ fig.12-a ] .",
    "indeed we note that the @xmath12 model has only a single maximum which gives rise to a single peak , both in @xmath1 and @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "naively one expects these two peaks to be essentially at the same frequency .",
    "this is already in contrast with experiments on bi-2212 where the @xmath3 peak is found at much lower frequency than the @xmath1 one .",
    "nevertheless if one takes into account the strong screening in the @xmath3 symmetry together with a sizeable smearing , one may obtain a large softening of the @xmath3 peak and reconcile theory with experiment .",
    "however , we find it eventually difficult in our calculations to get the necessary softening without obtaining simultaneously an unduly wide maximum .",
    "we give an example of such a calculation in fig.12-a .",
    "anyway our present observation of two distinct peaks in the same @xmath8 channel deduced from the @xmath109 symmetry ( see fig .",
    "4 ) can not be reconciled with a pure @xmath12 model .",
    "we note that the second peak , essentially at the same frequency as the @xmath9 one , had not been seen in our earlier experiments @xcite because only the @xmath135 symmetry had been measured .",
    "finally we consider the @xmath1 symmetry which , together with the @xmath2 symmetry , is easier to analyze because it is not affected by screening , in contrast with the @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "most strikingly the low frequency behavior of the theoretical @xmath12 @xmath1 spectrum is incompatible with our experimental results . in the @xmath12 model ,",
    "the response function for @xmath1 should increase as @xmath19 @xcite and it is clear , by inspection of fig . 9 and 11 , that our results are essentially linear in frequency .",
    "if we analyze our data more quantitatively , we have to recall that such a power law behavior is an appropriate description only at low frequency , and therefore the pending question is the choice of the proper energy scale when trying to fit the results . fitting the spectrum from fig.11 to a power law @xmath136 up to 300 @xmath100 yields @xmath137 inconsistent with an @xmath19 dependence @xcite . however , the choice of the energy range for fitting may be disputable , and a second fit to @xmath138 was attempted in order to provide a more accurate estimate of the relative weight w of the linear part with respect to the cubic part .",
    "w was computed over various energy ranges , e.g. up to 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 @xmath97 still using the spectra shown in fig.11 . actually , referring to fig.9",
    ", the low energy range of interest may not exceed 500 @xmath75 we found @xmath139 , meaning that a dominant linear component must be taken into account , inconsistent with a pure @xmath12 model .",
    "@xmath9 being linear at low frequency appears to agree with the tl-2201 results , at least at high enough excitation energy ( @xmath140 2.18 ev , or @xmath141 5734  ) @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that impurities are responsible for the observed low frequency density of states in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "devereaux @xcite has indeed shown that , in the unitary limit , for a @xmath12 gap , impurities induce for @xmath1 a linear rise of the electronic scattering at low frequency , crossing over to the @xmath19 dependence at higher frequency .",
    "the cross - over energy @xmath142 found in this case is typically the width @xmath133 of the band of states bound to impurities @xcite . for unitary scatterers",
    "this width is of order @xmath143 @xmath144 where @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 with @xmath147 the impurity concentration and @xmath149 the maximum of the d - wave gap . in the born limit it is in general much smaller @xmath150 @xmath151 @xmath152 @xmath153 where @xmath152 is the normal state relaxation time , and impurities bring no qualitative change in the density of states at low energy@xcite except for large relaxation rates .",
    "therefore the unitary case is the most favorable one for an important effect of impurities on raman scattering .",
    "however this is a very specific case , and experimental support is still lacking .",
    "note that in the case of a small or intermediate relaxation rate , one goes rapidly out of the unitary regime as soon as the scattering phase shift goes away from @xmath154 . only for a large relaxation rate @xmath155",
    "does the unitary regime extend over a fair range of scattering phase shifts . in the absence of experimental evidence ,",
    "a random distribution of scattering phase shifts would seem a reasonable assumption .",
    "it is worth recalling that this assumption of unitary scatterers was raised [ 32,33 ] in order to reconcile the robustness of the critical temperature against impurity scattering , which is unexpected in a d - wave superconductor , with the much less robust temperature dependence of the london penetration depth , whose linearity is thought to be affected by scattering .",
    "nevertheless , due to the difficulty of measuring the absolute value of the penetration depth , there is no strong experimental evidence for this assumption .",
    "actually , published data are somewhat contradictory [ 34,35 ] .",
    "let us nevertheless consider this unitary limit .",
    "our experimental results can be compared reasonably well with devereaux s calculation @xcite , taking @xmath156 this means a scattering rate @xmath145 of order of the gap @xmath149 itself .",
    "such a high scattering rate should strongly reduce the critical temperature or even destroy completely superconductivity .",
    "this is in marked contradiction with @xmath157 of our single crystals which does not differ in an appreciable way from the critical temperature of supposedly rather clean crystals .",
    "finally we remark that the fairly sharp structure that we observe in @xmath8 is difficult to reconcile with a large scattering rate .",
    "all together this makes rather unlikely the explanation of the linear behavior of the low frequency @xmath9 by an impurity effect .",
    "accordingly we consider that our results are representative of pure crystals .",
    "then an inescapable consequence of the observed linear frequency dependence is the occurrence of a finite density of states exhibiting a similar energy dependence , which is most naturally assigned to nodes in the gap . since these nodes are probed in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 symmetries , they can not be located only in the @xmath63 direction .",
    "we are thus left with the conclusion that nodes exist outside the @xmath63 direction .",
    "it is worth recalling that although raman scattering probes the electronic excitations along various * k * directions , it can not give accurately the location of the nodes @xcite .",
    "we have therefore to explore this point more quantitatively",
    ".    from the low energy part of our spectra , we know there are nodes outside the @xmath63 direction .",
    "it can readily be seen that a small shift of the nodes away from @xmath63 is not enough to account for experiment .",
    "indeed if we use a toy model @xmath158 @xmath159 obtained by artificially rotating the @xmath160 order parameter by an angle @xmath161 we find that a rotation by @xmath162 is barely noticeable in the spectra : the linear rise at low @xmath132 produced in @xmath1 by this rotation is quite small and the spectrum is essentially unchanged within experimental accuracy .",
    "having at this stage exhausted all information contained in the low energy dependence , in order to build up a specific model more appropriate than @xmath12 , we have to rely now on the high energy part of our spectra .",
    "while the @xmath15 symmetry offers only a hint of a maximum around @xmath163 the @xmath9 symmetry and the @xmath8 symmetry are much more informative .",
    "indeed we have the occurrence of two maxima at 500 and @xmath164 seen simultaneously in pure @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "the last one is seen separately in @xmath9 in a very clear way while the former is compatible with the structure seen in the @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "together these observations strongly suggest two different energy amplitudes for the gap .",
    "we assume that the gap has the symmetry of one of the one - dimensional representation of the tetragonal group , namely @xmath165 @xmath166 @xmath15 or @xmath167 we need only to consider the range of the fermi surface where the wavevector * k * has an angle @xmath168 with the x axis between 0 and @xmath169 the rest can be deduced by symmetry operations .",
    "our model must accommodate a main maximum m , a secondary maximum m - for the absolute value of the order parameter - and at least one node n ( we assume for simplicity that there is only a single secondary maximum and no secondary minimum since there is no experimental evidence for them ) .",
    "this does not match with any of the simplest representative for the order parameter , namely @xmath170 @xmath171 symmetry ) , @xmath172 @xmath98 symmetry ) , @xmath173 @xmath174 @xmath175 symmetry ) , or @xmath173",
    "@xmath174 @xmath172 @xmath176 symmetry ) .",
    "for instance , as pointed out by leggett , the simple @xmath177 symmetry is compatible with the low energy part of our spectra ; but it does not provide a proper account of the high energy part since it would give only peaks at a single frequency corresponding to the maximum of the gap .",
    "therefore we have to deal with a more complicated order parameter . from symmetry",
    "we must find at @xmath178 either m or m or n , and similarly at @xmath63 ( we eliminate the possibility of a discontinuous order parameter ) .",
    "since the main maximum m is seen in @xmath9 symmetry and not in @xmath15 symmetry , we have to put it at @xmath178 . similarly the secondary maximum m being inferred in @xmath15 symmetry but not seen in @xmath9 symmetry implies a location at @xmath63 .",
    "then the only place left for nodes is somewhere between @xmath178 and @xmath63 .",
    "since we have assumed a single secondary maximum , we can put only one node there .",
    "this leads to an order parameter which has over the whole fermi surface 4 ( equivalent ) m , 4 m and 8 nodes . since this order parameter is continuous and is nonzero at @xmath178 and @xmath63 , it has the @xmath8 symmetry",
    ". therefore we come to the conclusion that our raman scattering data imply an order parameter which does not break spontaneously the crystal tetragonal symmetry .",
    "however it is clear that any slight shift of m and m away from their symmetric locations will essentially not be felt in the resulting spectra .",
    "for example since our @xmath15 is quite featureless , we may worry that the presence of the main maximum m is washed out in it .",
    "so m could be away from @xmath178 .",
    "since m is at @xmath63 , we can only put a node at @xmath178 .",
    "but there is a node away from @xmath178 because @xmath15 is linear at low frequency .",
    "the only location for this node is between m and @xmath63 .",
    "we end up with an order parameter which has the @xmath15 @xmath179 symmetry , with 8 m , 4 m and 12 nodes over the whole fermi surface .",
    "similarly we might worry that a small contribution of m to the @xmath9 spectrum is not seen in our experimental results .",
    "however this seems almost incompatible with our data , except if m is quite near @xmath63 , but this would lead to an almost discontinuous order parameter since we have to put a node at @xmath63 . in this way we would have a @xmath9 symmetry order parameter , with 4 m , 8 m and 12 nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "finally we could also think of putting nodes at @xmath178 and @xmath63 , with m and m slightly away from these locations .",
    "we would need to put a node between them .",
    "hence we would have a @xmath177 order parameter , with 8 m , 8 m and 16 nodes .",
    "again this is hardly compatible with our @xmath9 data .",
    "in conclusion the @xmath8 order parameter is at the same time the simplest and the most compatible with our data . in the following",
    "we will concentrate on this symmetry and investigate it more quantitatively .",
    "a simple one - parameter model having the @xmath8 symmetry and satisfying the above requirements is @xmath180 @xmath181 @xmath182 $ ] where s = ( @xmath183 - @xmath184 ) / @xmath185 and @xmath149 = ( @xmath183 + @xmath186 ) / 2 .",
    "the gap maximum @xmath183 is obtained for @xmath168 = 0 while the secondary maximum @xmath187 occurs for @xmath168 = @xmath188 .",
    "the node lies at @xmath189 arccos(-s ) and in this simple model its location is linked to the ratio @xmath186 @xmath190 . naturally by introducing other parameters",
    "we can decouple these two quantities , as we will consider briefly below .",
    "since we make the choice s = 0.27 according to experiment , we find obviously the peaks for @xmath29 and @xmath40 in agreement with our experimental results ( fig .",
    "10 and 11 ) .",
    "we calculate the raman spectra for @xmath29 and @xmath40 symmetry by taking for the raman vertices the simplest form compatible with symmetry , namely @xmath191 , @xmath192 and a density of states independent of @xmath193 naturally the bare result for these spectra display a logarithmic singularity at their respective maximum and we have to invoke some broadening , most likely due to lifetime effects , in order to obtain theoretical results compatible with experiment . in this paper",
    "we include this broadening at the most phenomenological level by merely convoluting the bare result with a broadening function .",
    "we take a simple normalized lorentzian for this function .",
    "however we expect lifetime effects to be quite small at low energy and to grow progressively at higher energy .",
    "we account for this by choosing the width @xmath194 of our lorentzian proportional to the frequency at which we are looking : @xmath194 = a @xmath132 .",
    "explicitly our final spectrum @xmath195 is obtained from the bare spectrum @xmath196 by @xmath195 = @xmath197 d@xmath198 @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 @xmath202 @xmath203 where @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 @xmath202 = ( 1/ @xmath204 @xmath194 / ( ( @xmath132 @xmath200 @xmath205 @xmath206 . here",
    "the integration goes from @xmath207 to @xmath208 and @xmath196 is extended by symmetry @xmath209",
    "= @xmath200 @xmath196 in the whole frequency range .",
    "this broadening method insures f(0 ) = 0 , whatever @xmath210 in fig.10 and 11 we have taken our broadening parameter a = 0.15 .",
    "note that this parameter is our only way to adjust the peak height with respect to the low energy part of the spectrum .",
    "hence the fact that we find a good agreement in @xmath9 with experiment with a reasonably small broadening is satisfactory ( fig.11 ) .",
    "this is directly due to the fact that our node location @xmath211 = @xmath212 is far enough from @xmath63 , otherwise we would have trouble obtaining a strong enough low energy spectrum for @xmath166 as we have seen in our toy model .",
    "as expected , the part of the experimental spectrum above the peak frequency is not properly described by our model , inasmuch as we go toward higher energy .",
    "this is merely due to the fact that our theoretical result goes to zero for very high energies , in contrast with experiment .",
    "this discrepancy would be cured , at least partially , by taking proper account of lifetime effects , but this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in particular we ascribe the moderate agreement between theory and experiment in @xmath15 symmetry to strong lifetime effects in this channel ( fig.10 ) .",
    "we consider now in detail the @xmath8 symmetry . in our theoretical analysis",
    ", we take screening fully into account in the standard way .",
    "this feature makes the interpretation of the @xmath8 spectrum less easy than the @xmath9 or @xmath15 spectrum , because the result is not systematically related in an intuitive way to the shape @xmath213 of the order parameter .",
    "the most obvious manifestation of this is the fact that a constant @xmath8 raman vertex gives a zero contribution because of full screening .",
    "therefore we have to look for the next term in a fourier expansion in order to obtain a nonzero result .",
    "this term is proportional to @xmath214 however it goes to zero for @xmath168 @xmath215 that is very near the location of the node in our specific model .",
    "this implies that the @xmath8 electronic response will be quite small at small energy , in contradiction with experiment , which shows a strong linear dependence . for a sizeable @xmath8 response at low energy ,",
    "we need the zero of the @xmath8 raman vertex and the node of the gap to be clearly apart .",
    "since we have already chosen our order parameter , hence the node location , we achieve this by considering a more complicated raman vertex , e.g. including the next order fourier component : we take @xmath216 as seen in fig.12-b , we obtain a reasonably good agreement with experiment for a = 0.05 and a small smearing a = 0.03 .",
    "we note that we are led to use different smearing for the different raman symmetries , in contrast to what has been done in @xcite .",
    "this does not make a problem : the smearing is meant to account for lifetime effects at a phenomenological level .",
    "hence when dealing with different channels , there is no reason to have the same effective scattering .",
    "we obtain a sizeable contribution at low energy , at @xmath186 and at @xmath183 : this is clearly related to the fact that the raman vertex is not small for @xmath168 = 0 , for @xmath168 @xmath217 and at the node @xmath168 @xmath218 @xmath219 note that , while the size of the low frequency part is directly related to the strength of the raman vertex around the node , the same is not true for the strength of the peaks at @xmath186 and @xmath220 in particular one may obtain a single broad bump between @xmath186 and @xmath183 instead of two peaks .",
    "this is naturally due to the complex effect of the screening term .",
    "the small value a=0.05 , which implies that the @xmath221 contribution is negligible in the raman vertex compared to the @xmath222 contribution , comes from the strong constraints that the various characteristics of our @xmath28 spectrum put on the order parameter .",
    "we had already been led to consider a similar vertex in ref.@xcite to account for a @xmath8 spectrum which did not display a maximum at @xmath183 .",
    "while this is not expected beforehand , this does not imply anything pathological about the raman vertex we use and such a situation may very well occur accidentally . as we mentioned we",
    "are merely led to this case by our request of a sizeable vertex at 0 , @xmath223 /4 and at the node .",
    "clearly we can achieve this goal in other ways if we allow more flexibility in our order parameter .",
    "we demonstrate this by considering the following order parameter : @xmath213 @xmath146 @xmath183 for 0 @xmath224 @xmath168 @xmath224 @xmath225 /s , @xmath213 @xmath146 s ( @xmath226 ) for @xmath225 /s",
    "@xmath224 @xmath168 @xmath224 @xmath211 + @xmath186 /s , @xmath213 @xmath146 @xmath200 @xmath186 for @xmath211 + @xmath186 /s @xmath224 @xmath168 @xmath224 @xmath188 .",
    "its shape is similar to the simple one that we have used above , but in this way we can choose more freely the location of the node @xmath211 of @xmath213 and its slope s. on the other hand we restrict ourselves to the simplest raman vertex @xmath227 .",
    "we find a reasonably good agreement with experiment ( see fig.12-b ) for @xmath211 = @xmath228 and s = 3.6 .",
    "this shows that we can account for the @xmath8 spectrum by the simplest raman vertex together with an order parameter having two maxima and a node .",
    "however the bare @xmath9 spectrum provided by this latter order parameter has a very strong peak at @xmath183 ( inasmuch as we have taken a simple flat maximum model ) and a quite small low energy part , due to the node proximity of @xmath63 .",
    "this can not be reconciled with experiment by any reasonable smearing .",
    "again the strength of the linear low energy part of the @xmath9 spectrum shows that the node is rather far away from @xmath63 .",
    "note however that we could cure somewhat this difficulty by assuming a more complicated @xmath9 raman vertex , which would have a small strength for @xmath168 = 0 ( in addition of being zero by symmetry for @xmath168 = @xmath188 ) . in conclusion",
    "we believe that it is possible to account for experiment for all symmetries by an order parameter having the qualitative features that we have considered , together with raman vertices reasonably close to the simplest one .",
    "this might require perhaps that we use a varying density of states , while here we have assumed it to be constant for simplicity .",
    "however we have not tried to explore this problem more quantitatively .",
    "our model gives a natural explanation of the different positions of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 peaks and the existence of these two peaks in @xmath8 symmetry ( even if screening complicates the matter ) .",
    "note that peaks with different positions are also found in the other high-@xmath10 superconductors ( see table i ) . at this point",
    ", we can notice that the existence of two electronic structures is not only detected in raman scattering ( see table i ) but also in giaever tunneling @xcite and spectroscopy tunneling measurements @xcite in ybco .",
    "the energies of these two structures were found at @xmath229 and @xmath230 which corresponds to @xmath231 and 480 @xmath112 respectively ( very close to the values reported for ybco in table i ) .",
    "a d+s wave model as developed by m.t.beal-monod et al .",
    "@xcite accounts for the @xmath15 spectrum but can not explain the @xmath8 and @xmath9 spectra unless one introduces a very large scattering rate , which is incompatible with our critical temperature as we have discussed above .",
    "we note finally that the high values of the maxima ( @xmath232 ) as well as the non observation of a significant softening of the maxima , as a function of the temperature , as reported in section v.1 , are incompatible with a weak coupling theory @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented pure electronic raman spectra of hg-1223 single crystals . in the superconducting state",
    "our most significant results are i ) the two electronic maxima usually observed separately at 530 and 800 @xmath100 in @xmath15 and @xmath1 symmetries respectively , are seen simultaneously in @xmath8 symmetry . the existence of such two electronic features at @xmath233 ( 5 - 6 ) and ( 8 - 9 ) ,",
    "are reported not only in raman but also on tunneling measurements .",
    "ii ) these two electronic structures disappear at @xmath10 without showing significant softening as the temperature is raised .",
    "iii ) the electronic response function exhibits an intrinsic linear @xmath132 dependence - not only in the @xmath2 spectrum - but also in the @xmath1 spectrum , which has been extensively studied in this work : the linear dependence is robust against the change of the excitation frequency , implying that this is an intrinsic feature arising from the gap symmetry .",
    "these experimental results strongly suggest a very anisotropic superconducting gap , involving two characteristic energies and nodes located away from the [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath130 ] directions .",
    "such observations are inconsistent with a pure @xmath12 order parameter symmetry .",
    "the simplest order parameter compatible with our experimental data displays two maximum gap values and 8 nodes .",
