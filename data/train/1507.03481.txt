    "topological materials and structures represent one of the central research directions in the modern condensed matter physics .",
    "one of the classes of such materials is topological insulators and superconductors which possess a bulk gap and topologically protected surface excitations with massless dirac spectra .",
    "another important class is gapless materials with topologically protected fermi points or nodal lines .",
    "the most well - known example is graphene whose dispersion is characterized by two fermi points where the valence and the conduction bands touch .",
    "excitations in the vicinity of these points have a linear dispersion and can be viewed as two - dimensional dirac fermions .",
    "three - dimensional counterparts of graphene are dirac semimetals . in such a material",
    "the dispersion near the nodal point is characterized by @xmath4 dirac hamiltonian , i.e. the conductance and the valence bands have an additional twofold degeneracy .",
    "experimental realizations of dirac semimetals include cd@xmath5as@xmath6 @xcite and na@xmath5bi @xcite ; further candidate materials have been recently discussed @xcite .",
    "the twofold degeneracy discussed above can be lifted if either spatial inversion or time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "the four - component dirac solution then decouples into two independent two - component solutions representing two weyl fermions of opposite chirality .",
    "thus , each of the dirac points then splits into two weyl points without any additional degeneracies .",
    "recent experiments provided evidence that taas @xcite and nbas@xcite can be classified as weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "further promising candidates for weyl semimetals include pyrochlore iridates @xcite , topological insulator heterostructures @xcite , and cd@xmath5as@xmath6 with lowered symmetry @xcite . in the rest of the paper we will use the term `` weyl semimetal '' in a broader sense , including also the degenerate case of dirac semimetals .",
    "transport properties of weyl semimetals are highly peculiar ( for various theoretical aspects of the problem , see , e.g. , refs . and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , weak disorder ( with a strength below a certain critical value ) has a negligible effect on the density of states .",
    "specifically , the density of states vanishes quadratically in energy around the weyl point despite the presence of disorder .",
    "furthermore , the limits @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the frequency ) are not interchangeable for the behavior of the conductivity ( assuming that the chemical potential is at the weyl point ) .",
    "while sending frequency to zero first results in a finite conductivity , the zero-@xmath10 _ ac _ conductivity vanishes @xcite in the limit @xmath8 as @xmath11 . in the strong - disorder regime",
    "these singularities are eliminated .",
    "behavior of weyl semimetals in the external magnetic field is also expected to be very nontrivial .",
    "this is related , first of all , to the unconventional landau quantization of dirac fermions .",
    "furthermore , since a single weyl node displays a chiral anomaly , a possibility to control the valley polarization as well as a large anomalous hall effect are expected .",
    "@xcite much attention has been recently put on the longitudinal magnetoresistance in weyl semimetals that originates from the chiral anomaly .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we develop a theory of the transversal magnetoresistivity of a weyl semimetal .",
    "we are particularly interested in the range of sufficiently strong magnetic fields , such that the landau quantization is important .",
    "one of the motivations for our work was a spectacular experimental observation of a large , approximately linear magnetoresistance in the dirac semimetals cd@xmath5as@xmath6 and tlbisse in strong magnetic field .",
    "@xcite quantum linear magnetoresistance has been obtained by abrikosov in a seminal paper , ref .  , for dirac semimetals in the extreme limit when only one landau level is filled ( i.e. , the cyclotron frequency exceeds the temperature ) .",
    "the linear behavior was traced back to the magnetic - field dependent screening of charged ( coulomb ) impurities .",
    "we consider a general case of arbitrary relation between the magnetic field and temperature such that , depending on the regime , the magnetoresistance is dominated by contributions from the zeroth landau level , other separated landau levels , and overlapping landau levels .",
    "we address two alternative models of disorder : ( i ) short - range impurities and ( ii ) coulomb impurities .",
    "we show that for pointlike impurities the transition between the weak - disorder and the strong - disorder phases persists in the presence of magnetic field and explore singularities of the weak - disorder phase .",
    "further , we find that an unusual broadening of landau levels leads to a variety of regimes of the resistivity scaling in the temperature - magnetic field plane .",
    "the transversal magnetoresitance is found to be non - monotonous for the model of weak white - noise disorder .",
    "remarkably , in the limit of @xmath0 , the magnetoresistance for short - range impurities shows a non - analytical behavior @xmath1 . for strong pointlike impurities and for charged impurities",
    "we find a positive quadratic magnetoresistance at @xmath0 . in the limit of strongest magnetic fields",
    "@xmath2 , the magnetoresistivity vanishes as @xmath3 for pointlike impurities , while it is linear and positive in the model with coulomb impurities , in agreement with abrikosov s result  @xcite and recent experimental findings .",
