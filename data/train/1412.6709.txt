    "agns identified by their optical spectra are preferentially found in massive bulge - dominated hosts , with the fraction of galaxies with optical signs of accretion dropping dramatically at stellar masses @xmath6  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example ,  @xcite find that out of 25,974 low - mass ( @xmath79.5 ) galaxies with high signal - to - noise optical spectra , only 151 show any optical signatures of agn activity ( 0.6% ) and only 35 ( 0.1% ) are unambiguously identified as agns on the bpt diagram . while a combination of obscuration , energetically weak agns , and contamination by star formation all limit optical agn selection in late - type galaxies , optical agn selection in lower mass galaxies may also be affected by their lower metallicities , reducing their [ n  ii]/h@xmath8 emission line ratios and shifting agn - hosting galaxies into the hii region of the bpt diagram  ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and even unobscured agns may nonetheless fail to be discerned optically  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the use of optical agn diagnostics in low mass galaxies is further complicated in practice by the non - uniform nature of sdss spectroscopic targeting , which preferentially targets more luminous galaxies  ( i.e. , not dwarfs ; see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "motivated by the possibility that optical studies miss a significant fraction of agns in bulgeless and low mass galaxies , we used the the all - sky _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ) to search for optically hidden agns in a large sample of bulgeless galaxies @xcite .",
    "remarkably , we discovered several hundred optically normal bulgeless galaxies , many with low stellar masses , that display extreme red mid - infrared colors ( [ 3.4@xmath9-[4.6@xmath9 ; hereafter @xmath10-@xmath11 ) suggestive of dominant agns that may outnumber optically - identified agns by as much as a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "astonishingly , the vast majority of these galaxies have no signs of accretion at optical wavelengths .",
    "moreover , based on their red _ wise _ color , not only do these galaxies possibly harbor agns , but the agns must dominate the mid - ir luminosities of their galaxies , since in typical low redshift sources , it is very difficult to replicate the observed _ wise _ colors from star formation alone  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while the red mid - ir colors discovered by _ wise _ are highly suggestive of accretion activity , there are cases when red @xmath10-@xmath11 colors indicate hot dust due to extreme star formation , especially when associated with red @xmath11-@xmath13 ( [ 4.6@xmath9-[12@xmath9 ) colors",

    ", we find an upper limit to the hmxrb x - ray luminosity of @xmath103 , still nearly an order of magnitude less than what we measure , and less than what we measure at the @xmath104 level on the  @xcite relation .",
    "furthermore , the angular resolution limit of the nvss survey is @xmath105 , encompassing all of  and is considerably more than the angular resolution of _ xmm - newton _ , and so this upper limit on the sfr should be considered very conservative .",
    "finally , we note that the likely variability of s1 ( see  [ src1results ] ) , indicates that the x - ray emission is originating from a single source , further making it unlikely that a population of xrbs is responsible for the emission .      given the relatively low x - ray luminosity of s1 , we investigated the possibility that the x - ray source in  is an ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) .",
    "ulxs are off - nuclear x - ray sources with luminosities in excess of 10@xmath106  erg  cm@xmath2 , which is the eddington luminosity of a @xmath108 stellar mass black hole .",
    "the luminosities of ulxs can be produced either by anisotropic emission ( beaming ) or super eddington accretion from a stellar sized black hole or by accretion onto intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) , the latter scenario still being the subject of significant controversy  ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "ulxs are generally rare ; however they are preferentially found in regions of enhanced star formation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and low metallicity  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the occurrence rate per unit galaxy mass is higher in dwarfs than more massive galaxies  @xcite .",
    "recently  @xcite found 16 ulxs in 8 bulgeless galaxies , some with luminosities in excess of @xmath109  erg  cm@xmath2 .",
    "this raises the possibility that the x - ray source in  is a ulx , and therefore possibly consistent with a stellar sized black hole .",
    "we investigated the possibility that the x - ray source in  is a ulx by comparing the x - ray and mid - infrared properties of  with those of definitive agns and ulxs that are cleanly separated from their galaxies nucleus . in agns , the hard x - ray emission and the mid - infrared continuum emission is strongly correlated @xcite",
    "this is expected because the hard x - ray emission provides a direct view of the central engine , and the nuclear infrared continuum is dominated by thermally reprocessed radiation from the agn .",
    "we derived our sample of agns in the following manner : we cross - matched the final _ wise _ all - sky data release catalog ( allwise ) with the 3xmm - dr4 catalog to within less than @xmath110 , and obtained redshifts from sdss dr10 in a similar manner .",
    "we required that the _ wise _ @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath13 band fluxes have a signal - to - noise ratio greater than or equal to @xmath111 , and that there be no photometric quality or source extent flags .",
    "we similarly required that the _ xmm - newton _ hard band `` sc_ep4_flux '' and `` sc_ep5_flux '' values have a combined signal - to - noise ratio greater than or equal to @xmath111 , and that there be no high background level ( flaring ) flags .",
    "we further required that the x - ray sources show no sign of spatial extent by requiring the `` sc_extent '' flag be equal to 0 , and that the source observation off - axis angles be less than @xmath112 to minimize off - axis aberrations .",
    "we finally required redshifts greater than @xmath113 to reduce distance errors .",
    "this selection yielded 184 agns with 2 - 10 kev luminosities between @xmath114 = 42.1 - 46.7 and @xmath11 luminosities between @xmath115 = 42.2 - 46.5 [ erg  s@xmath2 ] .",

    "the ulxs are also associated with significantly different mid - ir colors than agns . the average @xmath10-@xmath11 color associated with these 57 ulx sources detected by _",

    "+ , title=\"fig:\",width=328 ]      given the above considerations , the only plausible explanation for the mid - ir and x - ray properties of  is the presence of an agn .",
    "we note , however , that  is certainly not the only dwarf galaxy with extreme or unusual mid - ir colors .",
    "for example , @xcite find , from a sample of @xmath126 sdss galaxies with _ wise _ colors , 4 dwarf galaxies with extreme _ wise _ colors @xmath10-@xmath127  mag .",
    "like , these galaxies are in the mass range of @xmath128  @xmath5 , and like , these galaxies are not particularly metal - poor dwarfs , with @xmath15=0.2 - 0.5 . however , these four galaxies occupy a completely different region of mid - ir color space than , not only with @xmath10-@xmath11=2.13 - 2.37 , but most notably with @xmath11-@xmath13=3.58 - 4.76 , indicating considerably more emission at longer wavelengths from dust heating due to starbursts .",
    "indeed , the sfrs of these four galaxies are in the range of 5.8 to 26.5 @xmath5  yr@xmath2 , at least two orders of magnitude higher than .",
    "finally , there exists a single _ chandra _ observation of one of the four galaxies from  @xcite , j1457 + 2232 , observed 2007 march 23 with acis - i for 7.2 ks ( obsid 7709 ; pi : garmire ) .",
    "the galaxy is not detected , with a @xmath95 upper limit to the 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath129  erg  @xmath51  s@xmath2 , assuming a similar x - ray spectrum to .",

    "because the ratio of the hard x - ray luminosity to the mid - ir luminosity is consistent with what is seen in agns , it is unlikely that we are seeing beamed x - ray emission . with this in mind",

    "using a conservative bolometric correction factor of @xmath132  @xcite , we get a lower mass limit of @xmath133 .",
    "more realistically , the black hole is not radiating at its theoretical upper limit .",
    "if the black hole is accreting at a rate similar to that found for the sample of low - mass black holes from  @xcite , then @xmath134 and the black hole mass is @xmath135 .",

    "we used the two dimensional parametric fitting program galfit @xcite to model the @xmath37 band image of .",

    "if more galaxies in this mass range are confirmed to host agns through x - ray observations , then a key result from this study is that the fraction of agns at low stellar masses , revealed by _ wise _ , may be much higher than the fraction of agns revealed optically  @xcite .",
