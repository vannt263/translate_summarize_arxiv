    "the combination of sufficiently strong disorder and interactions in a degenerate fermi system may precipitate a glassy state in an electronic system .",
    "such a scenario , referring to the state as ` electron glass ' , was offered in several theoretical papers two decades ago @xcite . further elaboration of the early models , including quantum effects , suggested that the glassy phase occurs on the insulating side of the metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence for glassy effects in disordered electronic systems were reported in few cases @xcite .",
    "the experiments showed several transport features that are typical of other glasses , e.g. , slow relaxation and memory effects including aging .",
    "aging is an intriguing memory effect common to many glassy systems @xcite .",
    "the system is said to exhibit aging if the response ( e.g. , relaxation from some excitation ) depends on the system history in addition to the time @xmath5 .",
    "that is in contrast to ergodic systems where the response depends only on @xmath5 . in electron glasses",
    ", this phenomenon may be observed in the  relaxation of the excess conductance @xmath6 created by changing the gate voltage from a state at which it equilibrated for @xmath1 back to a state where it was at full equilibrium ( employing a mosfet structure ) @xcite .",
    "this will be referred to here as a ` gate - protocol ' .",
    "it turns out that the aging function @xmath7 in this case is just a function @xmath8 of @xmath9@xcite .",
    "this so called ` full ' aging behavior has been rarely observed in such a clean form in any other glassy system .",
    "recently , another aging protocol was employed in anderson - localized indium oxide films by `` stressing '' the sample with a large electric field during @xmath1 ( ` stress - aging - protocol ' ) @xcite .",
    "the latter procedure is fundamentally different than the gate - protocol in that during the waiting time the system is _ excited _ as opposed to _",
    "relaxed _ in the gate - protocol .",
    "full aging was realized in this protocol as well .",
    "although the relaxation laws of the two protocols were not identical , both show a @xmath10 dependence for @xmath11 and a slower relaxation for @xmath12 .",
    "this means that the signature of @xmath1 is imprinted on the form of each relaxation curve ( in addition of course to the its effect on the _ amplitude _ of @xmath13 which is a necessary ingredient for the aging phenomenon to hold ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe yet another protocol to observe aging in an electron glass .",
    "motivated by recent theoretical work that shows aging in the electron glass @xcite , the protocol involves quench - cooling the sample from a high temperature @xmath4 to low temperature @xmath14 , and letting it partially relax for @xmath1 .",
    "the aging is tested by re - exciting the sample with a sudden change of the gate voltage , and the relaxation of the excess conductance @xmath6 is measured from this time onward ( ` t - protocol ' ) .",
    "several weaknesses , inherent in the t - protocol are pointed out .",
    "qualitatively however , the results are similar to these obtained with the gate - protocol and exhibit full - aging behavior ; the ensuing relaxation @xmath15 could be cast as @xmath16 over a wide range of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we compare the aging function obtained with the more reliable gate - protocol with the trap model suggested by bouchaud and dean . the implications for models of aging in quantum glasses @xcite , where dynamics in phase space is controlled by tunneling rather than by thermal activation , are discussed .",
    "several different batches of samples were used in the present study . all were thin films ( 50@xmath17  thick ) of crystalline indium - oxide that were e - gun evaporated on 110@xmath18 m cover glass .",
    "sample size was typically 1x1 mm and their sheet resistance r@xmath19 were in the range 1.5 - 55 m@xmath20 at @xmath21 .",
    "gold film ( @xmath221000  thick ) was evaporated on the backside of the glass and served as the gate electrode .",
    "conductivity of the samples was measured using a two terminal ac technique employing a 1211-ithaco current pre - amplifier and a par-124a lock - in amplifier .",
    "except when otherwise noted , the measurements reported here were performed with the samples immersed in liquid helium at @xmath23 held by a 100 liters storage - dewar , which allowed long term measurements of samples as well as a convenient way to maintain a stable temperature bath .",
    "the ac voltage bias was small enough to ensure linear response conditions ( judged by deviation form ohm s law being within the experimental error ) .",
    "fuller details of sample preparation , characterization , and measurements techniques are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the t - protocol used in the experiments described below involved the following steps .",
    "first , the sample , attached to a measuring probe along with a calibrated @xmath24 thermometer , is raised above the @xmath25he liquid level .",
    "the conductance of the sample and the reading of the @xmath24 thermometer are continuously monitored in the process of warming the sample to a temperature @xmath4 . during the time the sample dwells at @xmath4 the gate voltage @xmath26",
    "is set to an initial value , usually @xmath27 .",
    "care was taken to ensure that the sample is always in helium atmosphere to minimize irreversible changes of the sample during temperature cycling . with this setup ,",
    "warming up the sample and settling its temperature at @xmath4 usually took 3 - 10 minutes .",
    "the reverse operation , cooling the sample from @xmath4 to @xmath21 could be accomplished in 3 - 4 seconds . as will become clear below",
    ", this stage of the protocol is critically important for an aging experiment of the t - protocol type .",
    "the sample conductance @xmath2 was then plotted as function of the time that elapsed from the moment the @xmath24 thermometer reached @xmath21 .",
    "such a plot is shown in figure 1 for a typical run .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.jpg    note that , after the quench , @xmath2 decreases logarithmically .",
    "this is the natural ( ` history - free ' ) relaxation law of the electron glass ; as will be shown below it may persist for almost six decades in time . in this protocol , however , the sample is allowed to relax only for @xmath1 at which time the gate voltage is quickly changed ( typically over 5 seconds ) from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "this causes @xmath2 to increase , and then , while @xmath26 is held constant , it relaxes again towards a new equilibrium value set by @xmath29 and the bath temperature ( c.f . , figure 1 ) .",
    "finally , the time dependence of @xmath2 is recorded for a time span that extends at least three times @xmath1 . the same procedure",
    "is then repeated with exactly the same set of parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the changeover time of @xmath28 to @xmath29 ) except by using each time a different value for @xmath1 .",
    "the set of plots @xmath30 where @xmath5 is measured with respect to the time at which @xmath26 settled at @xmath29 , is used as the data for the analysis of the aging behavior as detailed in the next section .",
    "the gate protocol ( more fully described e.g. , in reference 9 ) starts after the sample equilibrated at @xmath3 under @xmath31 then , @xmath26 is switched to @xmath29 and allowed to relax for @xmath32 finally , @xmath28 is re - instated , and the excess conductance that ensues ( relative to the equilibrium value of @xmath2 ) is plotted versus time @xmath5 .",
    "a constant bath temperature is maintained for the entire process .",
    "the results reported here were reproduced on two different batches of samples . in the following however , we describe in detail the results on a single sample where extensive measurements were done , and where the conductance at a given temperature was least affected by the repeated temperature cycling . for the sample shown here",
    "the variance of @xmath2 at @xmath23 was within 1% for the entire series involving the cycling between @xmath4 and @xmath21 .",
    "this is an impressive figure considering that , for the sample used here , @xmath2 changes by two orders of magnitude in this temperature range .",
    "the set of data that resulted from using the t - protocol with six different waiting times and with @xmath33 is plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 plotted in the figure is the excess conductance affected by switching of @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "namely , @xmath6 is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the conductance versus time starting from the moment @xmath26 attained the target value @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the ` background conductance ' , a time dependent quantity reflecting the relaxation of @xmath2 following the quench .",
    "this subtraction also compensates for the @xmath38 variation in the value of @xmath2 immediately after a quench in different runs .",
    "@xmath37 is a function of both time and @xmath28 and is obtained by extrapolating towards the end - point of each run along the @xmath39 curve defined by the @xmath1 relaxation ( the curve recorded during the time interval marked by @xmath40 and @xmath41 in figure 1 , for example ) .    before discussing the results , the reasons for choosing the various parameters ,",
    "in particular the @xmath42 for @xmath43 should be mentioned .",
    "a low temperature for @xmath4 is beneficial in reducing the quench time and the risk of irreversible sample change due to the thermal cycling .",
    "there is however a concern that favors a relatively high @xmath4 in this experiments , and it is of a rather fundamental nature . in addition to slow relaxation , a common feature of all glasses is a slow approach to a steady state ; for example , applying a large voltage ( field ) across an electron - glass results in a time dependent increase of the conductance , a process that may last for days @xcite . the same behavior is observed when the bath temperature is changed from @xmath44 to @xmath45 and the effect is actually quite prominent as illustrated in figure 3 for a specific case .        clearly , this is a complicating feature that introduces additional parameters to control in an already involved procedure @xcite .",
    "fortunately , these ( and other ) non - ergodic effects become exponentially smaller with temperature @xcite and they are practically absent in our samples at @xmath46 . using these temperatures for @xmath4 instantly removed all traces of memory from the system , which made the ensuing results independent of the dwell time at @xmath4 .",
    "it is essential that the quench - cooling process will be fairly fast and smooth .",
    "if during the cooling process the sample is allowed to spend time at an intermediate temperature @xmath47 ( in the range where non - ergodic effects are noticeable ) , a signature of this @xmath47 will appear at the ensuing relaxation .",
    "this is one of the weaknesses of all protocols based on quench cooling .",
    "another problem that may actually become more severe when the cooling process is fast is the appearance of extra noise in the measurement after the quench .",
    "this takes the form of sudden bursts of fluctuations , with intermittent periods of activity that subsides after few hours .",
    "the problem presumably results from release of mechanical energy due to strains created in the process of quench - cooling the substrate / sample structure .",
    "repeated thermal cycling from temperatures somewhat higher than the intended @xmath4 ( training ) usually helped to minimize this disturbance .",
    "the other important parameter in the experiment is @xmath48 for which we chose @xmath49 as a value large enough to have a sizeable re - excitation and small enough not to destroy the memory of the system @xcite .",
    "the results of the two aging protocols exhibit several common features . in both cases ,",
    "the initial amplitude increases with @xmath1 , and the ensuing relaxation is more sluggish at any given @xmath5 ( compare figure 2a and 4a ) .",
    "also , upon normalizing @xmath50 by @xmath1 measured in each case , the curves collapse onto a common master plot ( figures 2b and 4b ) , and both master plots exhibit -@xmath39 for @xmath11 and a slower dependence for @xmath51 a notable difference is the non - zero asymptotic value of @xmath52 in the t - protocol ( figure 2b ) .",
    "this however is merely the excess conductance associated with the equilibrium field - effect , which is due to changing @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( a positive change in this particular case ) .",
    "this can be appreciated with the help of figure 5 that shows the conductance versus gate voltage for two stages of the aging process .",
    "the figure shows the ` memory cusp ' , which is a specific modulation in the conductance versus gate - voltage plot @xmath53 .",
    "it is seen by sweeping the gate voltage over a range including @xmath28 where the system is equilibrating . as noted elsewhere @xcite , the modulation that constitutes the cusp evolves with time during the equilibration process .        immediately after a quench from high",
    "temperature @xmath53 shows just an anti - symmetric field effect , which has essentially the same shape as the equilibrium result . with time",
    ", @xmath54 goes down along the dashed arrow in figure 5 .",
    "this is actually the process of the logarithmic conductance relaxation ( as observed in figure 6 ) , unveiling the characteristic shape of a cusp with a local minimum centered at @xmath55 a model accounting for such dynamics has been proposed by yu @xcite .",
    "note that the anti - symmetric part of @xmath53 does not depend on the waiting time nor on the sweep rate of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the equilibrium field effect to @xmath2 when @xmath26 is switched to @xmath56 from @xmath57 is @xmath58 and can be estimated from figure 5 as @xmath59 ( alternatively , one may use @xmath60 from the @xmath61 plot by extrapolating to the value of the conductance at @xmath62 along the well defined @xmath39 dependence as in figure 6 .",
    "the @xmath63 obtained by these two ways coincide to within the experimental error ) .",
    "this value of @xmath63 is drawn in figure 2b as a dashed line , and is in fair agreement with the asymptotic value of @xmath64    the quality of data collapse is almost as good in the t - protocol as in the gate - protocol except for the region @xmath65 where the scatter is more noticeable .",
    "the main source of error in t - protocol is presumably the uncertainty in the extrapolated function of @xmath66 which naturally is more pronounced for large @xmath67 the best one can do is to correct for the effect of variations in the bath temperature during the relaxation process . in the current case ,",
    "temperature variations was apparently not the only reason for the imperfect collapse for the @xmath65 regime .",
    "a probable cause is the presence of some burst noise discussed above .",
    "while the t - protocol has a number of weaknesses as an experimental procedure , it also has an advantage over the aging protocols previously used . in both , gate - protocol and the stress - protocol",
    "the sample is initially at _ equilibrium , _ and @xmath1 _ _ is the time it spends in an out of equilibrium state .",
    "this requires that for each @xmath1 one has to wait for the system to come to equilibrium , which , as may be inferred from figure 6 is a long wait . _",
    "_ in the t - protocol , on the other hand , the starting point is an _ ergodic state , _ so initializing the system for the next run is a fast process .",
    "also , this protocol seems the more natural way to probe ` aging ' in the sense used in everyday s life ; the system starts out `` young '' , is then `` aged '' for @xmath68 and the response @xmath50 due to the @xmath69 change is a measure of how deeply the system has `` aged '' .",
    "this is judged by the initial amplitude and by the temporal dependence of @xmath70    as an experimental procedure however , the t - protocol is manifestly not as easy as the two previously used protocols . the gate protocol , in particular , is less invasive , much easier to control and implement , and therefore more reliable .",
    "aging in the most general form means that the response of the system ( in our case the excess conductance @xmath71 is a function of both @xmath5 and @xmath72it would appear that , to exhibit such a behavior , it is sufficient that the system has a wide spectrum of relaxation times .",
    "indeed , the response due to the application of an exciting agent after @xmath1 will be composed of only those components that have already relaxed .",
    "therefore it is natural to expect that the ensuing response will be both larger and include slower components as @xmath1 increases .",
    "clearly , these are the two ingredients that characterize the aging phenomenon .",
    "it is easy to show in the t - protocol that @xmath73 the initial amplitude of @xmath50 depends on @xmath74 in a unique way@xmath75 this comes naturally from the basic properties of the electron glass , namely the logarithmic relaxation , and the time evolution of the memory cusp .",
    "the @xmath39 relaxation of @xmath2 following a quench from a high temperature is shown in figure 6 for the sample under study .",
    "therefore , at time @xmath1 after the quench one finds:@xmath76 ( 1)@xmath77where @xmath62 is the time resolution of the experiment ( typically , @xmath78 when @xmath26 reaches @xmath36 the conductance increases to @xmath53 ( see figures 1 and 5 for the definition of the various parameters ) .",
    "the initial amplitude for the relaxation after the switch of @xmath26 is @xmath79 and with ( 1):@xmath80=@xmath81 ( 2)the first two terms of the right hand side of ( 2 ) include @xmath63 the equilibrium field effect , which as discussed above is associated with the change with energy of the _ thermodynamic _ density of states .",
    "they also depend on the sweep rate of @xmath82 the value of @xmath43 and the cooling rate involved in the quench .",
    "the third term reflects the expected dependence on @xmath1 ; obviously the longer the system ages the more susceptible it becomes to re - excitation ( ` rejuvenation ' ) i.e. , a larger response will occur , simply because the excitation affects only those components that have already relaxed .",
    "the dependence of @xmath80 on the waiting time for the six aging runs used in figure 2 is depicted in figure 6 .",
    "while these considerations account for aging in its general form , the data collapse upon scaling by @xmath83 illustrated in figures 2 and 4 can not be explained just by using the above assumptions , and a more fundamental treatment appears to be needed .",
    "the heuristic model offered to account for full - aging in the gate protocol @xcite is much harder to justify for the t - protocol .",
    "the model involved two elements .",
    "the first is the logarithmic relaxation law .",
    "this was shown to follow from the basic features of hopping transport @xcite and it is supported by recent monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the second was an assumption of some symmetry inherent to the gate - protocol when @xmath84 is small enough .",
    "it was later found that full aging is still observed even when this symmetry is absent @xcite .",
    "the lack of symmetry is even more obvious in the stress - aging - protocol which nonetheless show very good data collapse @xcite .",
    "moreover , the heuristic model could explain the data collapse only in the regime @xmath85where the logarithmic law is obeyed while the master plots in all three protocols deviate from the logarithmic law for @xmath86 for the gate protocol the signal / noise is good enough to confirm full aging behavior at least up to @xmath87 .",
    "for later times @xmath50 reaches quickly the noise level as illustrated in figure 7 and we can not be sure that there is still a perfect collapse .",
    "nevertheless , there seems to be a wide enough time interval over which full aging is observed in the @xmath65 regime , and it is not describable by a logarithmic time dependence .",
    "the right model for full aging in the electron glass must be able to account for this regime as well as for the @xmath11 regime .",
    "a model that gives full aging in both @xmath11 and @xmath65 regimes has been suggested by bouchaud and dean @xcite . in their tree model ,",
    "the two - time response is given as : @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath11 and @xmath65 respectively and where @xmath90 .",
    "the data in figure 7 are plotted to allow comparison with the @xmath65 regime .",
    "note that to be consistent with the model , the value of @xmath91 has to be about @xmath92 ( c.f .",
    ", figure 7 ) .",
    "this is the average value of the best - fit exponent found in eight aging experiments based on the gate - protocol .",
    "the values for @xmath91 in these runs ranged between @xmath93 to @xmath94 this constrains the value of @xmath95 to be @xmath96 for the relaxation in the @xmath65 regime .",
    "to reconcile the experimental results ( figure 6 ) with the model for the @xmath11 regime requires @xmath97 and given the scatter in the data of figure 7 we can not rule out agreement with the model .",
    "this agreement however may be fortuitous .",
    "the bouchaud and dean model assumes dynamics of a classical glass , where the barriers in phase space are crossed by thermal activation .",
    "this is not appropriate for the case of a quantum glass like the electron glass @xcite .",
    "in particular , the value of the exponent @xmath91 in the model is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a glass temperature @xcite .",
    "this gives the aging function a specific temperature dependence , in contrast with the experiment @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the overall resemblance of the model predictions to actual data suggest that the underlying approach may have merit for real systems",
    ". this might encourage researchers to look for a modification of the model that are more appropriate for a glass with tunneling controlled dynamics rather than by thermal activation .    using the gate - protocol it was shown before @xcite that the aging function fits well a stretched exponent expression : @xmath100",
    "$ ] with @xmath101 and @xmath102 this expression , with strikingly similar parameters @xmath103and  @xmath104 were found to fit many aging experiments on both crystalline and amorphous indium - oxide films .",
    "the gate - protocol , recently applied to granular al films , exhibited a near - perfect full - aging , and seem to fit quite well to the stretched - exponent expression above with @xmath105 and @xmath106@xcite@xmath75 full - aging behavior was observed in experiments based on the stress - protocol on @xmath107 films , and the results could be fitted by the stretched - exponent with @xmath108 and @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "finally , the aging function of the t - protocol could be fitted by a stretched exponent with @xmath110 and @xmath111(after subtracting 0.58 - 0.6 that represents @xmath63 from the data in figure 2b ) .",
    "it is important to note that these fits to the stretched exponent function should be merely regarded as a convenient classification scheme ; to see that the stretched exponent can not be the correct description of these experiments suffice is to notice that for @xmath11 the function reduces to a power - law dependence with exponent @xmath112 a value for @xmath113 of the order of 0.2 may reasonably mimic a @xmath39 dependence over a limited range , which is why this , in - principle discrepancy ( c.f . ,",
    "figure 6 ) , does not stand out in aging experiments where @xmath1 was restricted to less than 4 decades .",
    "what the similarity of parameters does tell us is that the aging function of several systems must have a similar shape .",
    "this is not a trivial observation .",
    "the studied systems ; crystalline indium - oxide , several versions of amorphous indium - oxides @xcite , and granular al are totally different in terms of microstructure , and they usually exhibit quite different conductance versus temperature laws @xmath114 @xcite . the feature that is common to all these systems is that they are strongly localized , which is the pre - requisite to be in the electron glass phase @xcite , and their @xmath114 is consistent with hopping transport mechanism @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the latter is an important ingredient in bringing about the ` unified ' aging behavior ; namely , it is the logarithmic relaxation inherent to the hopping mode of transport @xcite that is common to all of the full - aging examples listed above . actually , the only difference between the results of different systems ( and different protocols ) , is the value at which the aging function @xmath115 deviate from the _ generic _ @xmath39 behavior .",
    "the challenge is to find the physical scheme that controls this aspect of the full - aging phenomenon .",
