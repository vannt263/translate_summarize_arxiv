    "over the last decade , entanglement has come to be viewed as a possible resource for various quantum information and computation purposes .",
    "the prospect of scalability and integrability of solid state quantum circuits with conventional electronics has led to great interest in the investigation of entanglement in solid state systems . a broad spectrum of proposals for generation , manipulation and detection of entanglement in solid state systems is given in this volume .",
    "of particular interest is the entanglement of individual quasiparticles in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "phase coherence is preserved on long time scales and over long distances , allowing for coherent manipulation and transportation of entangled quasiparticles . moreover , individual quasiparticles are the elementary entanglable units in solid state conductors and investigation of quasiparticle entanglement can provide important insight in fundamental quantum mechanical properties of the particles and their interactions .",
    "recently , a number of proposals for creation of entanglement in mesoscopic systems based on scattering of quasiparticles have been put forth  @xcite .",
    "our main interest here is to discuss a central aspect of such systems operating in the tunneling regime , namely the role of the redefinition of the vacuum in creating an entangled two - particle state . to this aim",
    "we consider the two original proposals , refs . @xcite and @xcite , were the ground state reformulation",
    "was discussed .",
    "the emphasis in these works was on entanglement of the orbital degrees of freedom  @xcite , the discussion however applies equally well to spin entanglement . in the first proposal",
    "@xcite , we investigated a normal mesosocopic conductor contacted to a superconductor .",
    "the superconductor was treated in the standard mean - field description , giving rise to a bogoliubov - de gennes scattering picture with independent electron and hole quasiparticles .",
    "it was shown that andreev reflection at the normal - superconducting interface together with the redefinition of the vacuum can gives rise to an entangled two - electron state emitted from the superconductor into the normal conductor .",
    "second , beenakker _",
    "et al _  @xcite and later the authors  @xcite investigated a normal conductor in the quantum hall regime .",
    "it was shown that the scattering of individual electron quasiparticles together with the redefinition of the vacuum can give rise to emission of entangled electron - hole pairs from the scattering region .    in the present paper ,",
    "first a general framework for entanglement of independent fermionic quasiparticles in mesoscopic conductors is presented .",
    "the role of the system geometry and the accessible measurements in dividing the conductor into subsystems as well as defining the physically relevant entanglement is emphasized .",
    "we then consider a simple , concrete example with a multiterminal beamsplitter geometry and derive the emitted manybody scattering state .",
    "two different approaches to the experimentally accessible two - particle entanglement are discussed .",
    "first , a general scheme for arbitrary scattering amplitudes based on a reduced density matrix approach is outlined and then applied to the state emitted by the beamsplitter geometry .",
    "the orbital entanglement of the reduced state is discussed in some limiting cases .",
    "second , for the system in the tunneling limit , we show how an entangled two - particle state is created by a redefinition of the vacuum .",
    "the redefinition leads to a transition from a single - particle to a two - particle picture , with the wavefunction being transformed from a many - body state of independent quasiparticles to a state describing an entangled two - particle state created out of the redefined vacuum .",
    "based on this discussion , a detailed investigation of the entanglement in the systems in refs .",
    "@xcite is presented .",
    "the concept of entanglement appeared in physics in the mid nineteen thirties @xcite as a curious feature of quantum mechanics giving rise to strong non - local correlations between spatially separated particles .",
    "the non - local properties of entanglement contradicted a commonly held `` local , realistic '' view of nature and led einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) to conclude , in their famous paper @xcite , that quantum mechanics was an incomplete theory . with the inequalities of bell",
    "@xcite , presented three decades later , it became possible to experimentally test the predicted non - local properties of entangled pairs of particles . since then a large number of experiments have been carried out , predominantly with pairs of entangled photons @xcite , where a clear violation of a bell inequality has been demonstrated , providing convincing evidence against the local realistic view of nature . to date , however , no violation of a bell inequality with electrons has been demonstrated .    during the last decade ,",
    "the main interest has turned to entanglement in the context of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it has become clear that entanglement can be considered as a resource for various quantum information tasks , such as quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum dense coding @xcite . the notion of entanglement as a resource naturally led to the question of how to quantify the entanglement of a quantum state",
    ". a considerable number of measures of entanglement have been proposed to date @xcite , ranging from describing abstract mathematical properties of the state to quantifying how useful the state is for a given quantum information task .",
    "it is mainly the prospect of quantum information processing in solid state conductors that has motivated the recent interest in entanglement in mesoscopic conductors . in this work",
    "we do however not try to answer the ambitious question what quantum information tasks can be performed in mesoscopic systems .",
    "we do also not consider any particular measure of entanglement , instead we focus the discussion on the entangled quantum state .",
    "given the state , the entanglement , quantified by ones measure of liking , can in principle be calculated .",
    "therefore we are interested in the basic first step in a quantum information processing scheme , namely the creation , manipulation and detection of quasiparticle entanglement .",
    "a large number of implementations of this first step have been proposed , typically a certain mechanism is suggested that leads to emission of entangled particles from a `` source '' s. the particles propagate out to spatially separated regions a and b , where they are manipulated and detected . two schematics of generic systems for orbital and spin entanglement are shown in fig .",
    "[ figents ] .",
    "very recently , in a number of works @xcite entanglement in systems of quasiparticles has been investigated within the framework of scattering theory .",
    "these proposals are of particular interest because working with independent particles allows for a complete characterization of the emitted many - body state for arbitrary scattering amplitudes .",
    "moreover , the notion of entanglement without direct interaction between the quasiparticles , a known concept in the theory of entanglement @xcite , has appeared puzzling to members of the mesoscopic community .",
    "the perception in the mesoscopic physics community has started to change only with the apperance of ref .",
    "this makes it important to thoroughly analyze the origin of the entanglement .",
    "here we contribute to such an analysis , focusing on the creation of entangled two - particle states due to redefinition of the vacuum . for comparison , an approach based on the reduced two - particle density matrix",
    "is discussed as well . although not investigated here , it is probable that the two types of states turn out to be of different `` usefulness '' for quantum information processing , making a detailed comparision of interest .",
    "we start by stating some important general properties of entanglement and comment on their application to entanglement in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "\\i ) the entanglement of a state in a given system depends on how the system is formally parted in to subsystems  @xcite .",
    "if the system is considered as one entity , i.e. with all quasiparticles living in the same hilbert space , one has to consider the question of entanglement of indistinguishable particles  @xcite . for a mesoscopic system of independent fermionic quasiparticles ,",
    "the ground state is given by a product state in occupation number formalism , i.e. the wavefunction is a single slater determinant .",
    "apart from the correlations due to fermionic statistics the particles show no correlations and the state is not entangled .",
    "however , if the system is considered as consisting of several spatially separated subsystems , one can pose questions about the entanglement between spatially separated , distinguishable quasiparticles living in the different subsystems .",
    "the latter is typically the case in the proposed mesoscopic systems ( see fig . [ figents ] ) , which are naturally parted into the source s and the two regions a and b. the entanglement between two particles , one in a and one in b , is in many situations nonzero . quite generally , the physically relevant partitions into subsystems are defined by the system geometry and the possible measurements one can perform on the system  @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) the entanglement that can be investigated and quantified is determined by the possible measurements one can perform on the system .",
    "although a wide variety of measurements in mesoscopic conductors in principle can be imagined , the most commonly measured quantities are currents and current correlators , i.e. current noise @xcite . in particular , in several recent works it was proposed to detect entanglement via measurements of current correlators @xcite .",
    "this leads us to focus the discussion on entanglement detectable with current correlation measurements .",
    "all current cross correlation measurements , needed to investigate spatially separated particles , are to date measurements of second order correlators .",
    "importantly , the second order current correlators are two - particle observables and can thus only provide direct information about two - particle entanglement .",
    "we thus limit our investigations here to the two - particle properties of the state @xcite .    considering the typical mesoscopic entanglement setup in fig .",
    "[ figents ] , the points i ) and ii ) lead us to discuss the entanglement between two spatially separated particles , one in a and one in b , detectable via correlations of currents flowing out into the reservoirs .",
    "such a bipartite system is also the most commonly considered one in investigations of entanglement .",
    "importantly , the entanglement can be both in the orbital @xcite as well as in the spin degrees of freedom , the relevant entanglement depends on the proposed system geometry which can be designed to investigate orbital @xcite or spin @xcite entanglement .",
    "we also note that our measurement based scheme excludes all types of occupation number or fock - space entanglement , e.g. the linear superposition of two particles at @xmath0 and two at @xmath1 [ which in an occupation number notation can be written as the fock - space entangled state @xmath2 .",
    "there is thus no need to enforce additional constraints  @xcite on the state to exclude the physically irrelevant fock - space entanglement .",
    "to clearly illustrate the basic principles , we present here the formalism for independent quasiparticles in the most elementary mesoscopic system possible .",
    "we focus the discussion on the orbital entanglement which has the advantage that it can be manipulated and detected @xcite with existing experimental techniques .",
    "however , for completeness , spin information is retained throughout the discussion .",
    "the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ figcond ] . in the source region ,",
    "two single mode reflectionless beamsplitters are connected to four electronic reservoirs @xmath3 and @xmath4 . a voltage bias @xmath5 is applied to reservoirs @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while reservoirs @xmath8 and @xmath4 are kept at zero bias .",
    "quasiparticles injected from reservoirs @xmath6 and @xmath7 scatter at the beamsplitters and propagate out towards regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the quasiparticles are scattered at another pair of beamsplitters ( i.e. a local single qubit rotation ) and then detected in four reservoirs @xmath9 and @xmath10 , all kept at zero potential .",
    "we emphasize that all components of this system can be realized in a conductor in the quantum hall regime @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the entanglement of the state emerging from the source region , _ before _ the quasiparticles reach the beamsplitters in regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the manipulation and detection processes taking place in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are thus not investigated .",
    "the two orbital modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with labels @xmath6 and @xmath7 denoting from which reservoir the particles are emerging ( see fig .",
    "[ figcond ] ) , constitute the orbital two - level , or pseudo - spin , system . working within the quasiparticle scattering approach @xcite",

    "the energy is counted from the fermi level of the unbiased reservoirs .",
    "the transport state of the system at zero temperature is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the quasiparticle vacuum , a filled fermi sea at energies @xmath19 .",
    "this describes filled , noiseless streams of electrons emitted from reservoirs @xmath6 and @xmath7 , propagating towards the first pair of beamsplitters . to describe the state after scattering at the beamsplitters",
    ", we introduce operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 for particles originating from reservoir @xmath22 , propagating from the beamsplitters towards regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 are related to @xmath23 via the scattering matrices of the beamsplitters . for simplicity",
    "we consider identical beamsplitters , taken independent on @xmath14 and @xmath15 , giving ( suppressing spin and energy index ) @xmath24 we note that only static scatterers are considered here , the discussion could however straightforwardly be extended to time dependent scatterers , recently investigated in the context of entanglement in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to simplify the notation ,",
    "a collective quantum number @xmath25 denoting both orbital mode and spin is introduced .",
    "the state describing particles propagating out towards @xmath0 and @xmath1 can then be written @xmath26 due to the scattering , the outflowing streams are noisy and the properties of the particles flowing towards @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be investigated via noise measurements . here we are interested in the entanglement between two particles in the outflowing streams , one towards @xmath0 and one towards @xmath1 .",
    "importantly , the state @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ psiout ] ) is a many - body state , it describes a linear superposition of different number of particles at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , ranging from zero to in principle infinity . since only two - particle entanglement",
    "is considered , one thus needs to deduce the two - particle properties of the state @xmath27 .",
    "below we present two different approaches to do this , giving rise to two different quantum states with in general different entanglement .",
    "we first discuss a general approach , applicable for arbitrary scattering amplitudes . starting with the properties of the correlators of outflowing currents towards a and b",
    ", we note that the cross correlators ( in the most general situation ) are determined by averages of the type @xcite @xmath28 using in the second step the anticommutation relations for fermionic operators .",
    "the term @xmath29 is by definition an element of the reduced two - particle density matrix ( in the energy basis ) .",
    "the current correlators are thus fully characterized by the reduced two - particle density matrix @xmath30 accordingly , the entanglement potentially detectable via noise measurements is the entanglement of the reduced two - particle density matrix . clearly , this is the situation for any two - particle observable . it should be emphasized that the two - particle density matrix physically describes the correlations of two particles out of the streams flowing towards @xmath0 and @xmath1 , leaving all other particles unobserved .",
    "this is qualitatively different from a projection of a two - particle state out of the full many - body state , where only the components of the state containing exactly two particles are selected .",
    "it is shown below that these two different ways of extracting a two - particle state out of a many particle state can give rise to different states , and consequently to different entanglement .    even with the object of interest confined to the reduced two - particle density matrix , a full characterization of the entanglement is cumbersome since @xmath31 is in general a mixed state and the two particles live in infinite dimensional hilbert spaces spanned by @xmath32 . in some simple situations ( see e.g. below ) , the density matrix in eq .",
    "( [ densmat ] ) can be written as a direct product of the density matrices for the different degrees of freedom , e.g. @xmath33 , where the subscripts @xmath34 and @xmath14 denote orbital , spin and energy respectively .",
    "this allows one to independently characterize the entanglement with respect to the different degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , the orbital subspace in fig . [ figcond ] and in e.g. refs . @xcite as well as",
    "generically the spin 1/2 space are two - level systems or qubits , giving rise to a system of two coupled qubits , well studied in the entanglement literature ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite )    however , in the general case , with arbitrary scattering amplitudes , the reduced two - particle density matrix can not be written as a direct product , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "what can then be said about the entanglement ?",
    "of particular interest is the entanglement detectable via zero frequency current correlators , generally the quantity investigated in experiments .",
    "the zero frequency limit effectively projects the operators in eq .",
    "( [ twopart ] ) to the same energy @xcite . for scattering amplitudes independent on energy on the scale of @xmath36 , the energy argument in eq .",
    "( [ densmat ] ) can be suppressed , giving a reduced density matrix @xmath37 the density matrix @xmath38 contains information about the orbital and spin parts of the state only .",
    "interestingly , following the opposite approach and considering the quasiparticle ( @xmath39 ) correlator for coincident times , closely related to the electronic counterpart @xcite to the joint detection probability introduced by glauber @xcite in quantum optics , one finds the same reduced density matrix @xmath38 as in the zero frequency limit .",
    "similar results for short time current correlators have been obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath38 for the system under consideration ( see fig .",
    "[ figcond ] ) is evaluated from eqs .",
    "( [ gs ] ) , ( [ scatmat ] ) and ( [ densmatos ] ) to be @xmath40 expressed in the orbital basis @xmath41 is the @xmath42 unit matrix .",
    "note that since the particles in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are distinguishable there is no need for anti - symmetrization and we can use the notation e.g. @xmath43 .",
    "formally , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ sodens ] ) results from the direct pairing of the operators in the bracket in eq .",
    "( [ densmat ] ) and is given by the direct product of the single particle density matrices at @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the second term results from the exchange pairing .",
    "since the direct term by definition does not describe any nonlocal correlations ( it is a separable state with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , it is the exchange correlations which are responsible for the entanglement . for the current correlators , it should be noted that the first term determines the product of the averaged currents , while the second term determines the irreducible current correlators , i.e. the correlators of the current fluctuations , the noise .",
    "we also note that @xmath38 is independent on scattering amplitudes , a consequence of the assumption of identical , spin independent beamsplitters .    as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ sodens ] ) , even though we consider a simple geometry with spin - independent scattering , the reduced density matrix @xmath38 is not a direct product between orbital and spin part , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "many observables are however not sensitive to the spin degree of freedom , as is the case for cross correlators between total currents @xmath45 , typically the cross correlators investigated in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "the effective orbital density matrix accessible via current correlators is then obtained by tracing @xmath38 over the spin degree of freedom , giving @xmath46=\\frac{1}{6}\\left(2{\\bf 1}-f\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}\\left({\\bf 1}+2|\\psi_o\\rangle \\langle\\psi_o|\\right ) \\label{odens}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "this state , an example of a werner state @xcite , can via suitable local transformations be written on a separable form @xcite with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 and is consequently not entangled .",
    "we note that the same holds for the reduced spin density matrix @xmath48 , obtained by tracing over orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "a different situation occurs if one considers a spin - polarized system , as was done e.g. in @xcite . in this case",
    "the density matrix is purely orbital , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ densmatos ] ) by suppressing the spin notation . for the system in fig .",
    "[ figcond ] we obtain @xmath49 an orbital singlet , i.e. a maximally entangled state , again independent on scattering amplitudes .",

    "( [ gs ] ) appropriate under the stated assumptions .",
    "the corresponding outgoing state is @xmath51 the first two terms describe two particles at a or two at b , while the last term describes one particles at a and one at b. as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ densmatos ] ) , only the last term , which is just @xmath52 , contributes to @xmath53 .",
    "importantly , for the two - particle state in eq .",
    "( [ twoelstate ] ) , the reduced density matrix approach gives the same result as projecting out the part of the state which contains one particle at @xmath0 and one at @xmath1 .",
    "both procedures are thus equivalent to a post - selection of entanglement , as originally discussed in quantum optics @xcite ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion for fermions ) .",
    "various issues of projection and post - selection were recently discussed in a number of works on entanglement in mesoscopic conductors with arbitrary scattering amplitudes @xcite ( for a related discussion , see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note the clear difference between an orbital state obtained by tracing @xmath38 over the spin degrees of freedom and the orbital state in a spin polarized system .",
    "the difference can be attributed to the fact that only spins of the same spieces are nonlocally correlated , i.e. contribute to the entanglement of the state . detecting ( without spin resolution )",
    "two particles , one at @xmath0 and one at @xmath1 , the probability of obtaining two identical spins is only one half , reducing the entanglement of the state to zero .",
    "a qualitatively different approach to the characterization of the emitted state can be taken in the limiting case of a tunneling system , as was done in refs .",

    "<S> a scattering approach to entanglement in mesoscopic conductors with independent fermionic quasiparticles is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on conductors in the tunneling limit , where a redefinition of the quasiparticle vacuum transforms the wavefunction from a manybody product state of noninteracting particles to a state describing entangled two - particle excitations out of the new vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is illustrated with two examples ( i ) a normal - superconducting system , where the transformation is made between bogoliubov - de gennes quasiparticles and cooper pairs @xcite , and ( ii ) a normal system , where the transformation is made between electron quasiparticles and electron - hole pairs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is compared to a scheme where an effective two - particle state is derived from the manybody scattering state by a reduced density matrix approach . </S>"
