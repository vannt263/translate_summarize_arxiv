    "the structure of a spiral galaxy is closely tied to its angular momentum distribution .",
    "thus , understanding galaxy formation requires knowledge of how galaxies acquire their angular momentum . the tidal torque model for the acquisition of angular momentum by galaxies @xcite states that protogalaxies acquire their angular momentum through the tidal interaction between the protogalaxy and the surrounding nonuniform matter distribution .",
    "spiral galaxies are particularly useful for testing how galaxies acquire angular momentum .",
    "spiral galaxies contain relatively cold , thin disks of stars , gas , and dust , supported primarily by rotation rather than velocity dispersion .",
    "these thin disks are unlikely to have suffered a major merger ( or large numbers of minor mergers ) since their formation ; thus , the orientation of a disk s spin angular momentum is unlikely to have changed drastically since the material that formed it was initially torqued .",
    "binary spiral galaxies are particularly useful test cases for the acquisition of angular momentum .",
    "a `` binary spiral galaxy '' can be defined as a pair of spiral galaxies that are relatively close to each other , but are much farther away from other galaxies of comparable or greater mass .",
    "our galaxy and m31 , using this general definition , can be thought of as a binary spiral galaxy .",
    "they are separated by @xmath5 , and m33 , the next brightest galaxy in the local group , is @xmath6 magnitudes fainter than our galaxy or m31 . if a pair of spiral galaxies is a totally isolated system , with zero net angular momentum initially , then conservation of angular momentum states that the net angular momentum remains zero after the two galaxies have spun each other up .",
    "if the net angular momentum of the binary system is , in fact , zero , then the relative orientation of the internal angular momentum vectors of the two galaxies can range from anti - parallel , if the two galaxies are on radial orbits relative to each other , to parallel , if the orbital angular momentum is large .    in the real universe ,",
    "binary spiral galaxies are never completely isolated .",
    "@xcite , for instance , in their study of the angular momentum of the local group , conclude that most of the angular momentum of our galaxy was produced by m31 , but that the tidal torquing by nearby groups , such as the maffei group ( @xmath7 ) and m81 group ( @xmath8 ) , was not negligible .",
    "thus , we might expect the distribution of the angle @xmath9 between the internal angular momentum vectors of the two galaxies in a pair to depend on the number of massive galaxies within several megaparsecs of the pair .",
    "in addition , the distribution of @xmath9 will also depend on the evolutionary history of binary spiral galaxies since they initially attained their angular momentum by tidal torquing .",
    "for instance , the merger timescale for a bound pair of galaxies depends on the ellipticity @xmath10 of their mutual orbit @xcite , with more nearly radial orbits having a shorter merging timescale .",
    "thus , binary spiral galaxies with radial orbits will more rapidly merge to form an elliptical galaxy . in the case that the binary spiral galaxies are initially isolated",
    ", this will result in preferential destruction of the binaries whose internal angular momenta are anti - parallel .",
    "computer simulations have provided additional insight into the alignment of galaxy spins . in @xmath11-body",
    "@xmath12 cold dark matter simulations , for instance , massive dark halos ( @xmath13 ) have spins that are preferentially oriented in a direction perpendicular to the mass distribution @xcite , and have projected major axes that are aligned with the surrounding galaxy distribution @xcite ; these alignments persist on scales up to @xmath14 .",
    "it should be kept in mind , though , that a dark halo is not necessarily a simple structure ; @xcite show that in the millennium-2 @xmath11-body simulation @xmath15 of all halos have nearly perpendicular major axes at large and small radii .",
    "@xcite , in a hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulation that permits disks to form by dissipation , find that at @xmath16 , the spin of stellar and gaseous disks are well aligned with the spin of the inner dark halo ; however , the alignment between disk spin and the spin of the entire host halo is significantly weaker .",
    "many studies have been done of the relative orientation of the spin vectors of neighboring spiral galaxies .",
    "three different methods , using increasing amounts of information for each binary spiral galaxy , may be distinguished .",
    "the first method for studying the relative orientation of disk galaxies uses only the position angle of the apparent major axis of each galaxy .",
    "if a galaxy is approximated as a rotationally flattened oblate spheroid , then its apparent major axis is at right angles to the projection of its spin axis onto the plane of the sky .",
    "the angle @xmath0 between the apparent major axes of the two galaxies in a binary spiral galaxy , defined so that @xmath17 , is thus the angle between the projections of the spin axes . if the spin axes of the two spiral galaxies tend to be parallel ( implying either parallel or anti - parallel spin vectors )",
    ", then the distribution of @xmath0 will be weighted toward @xmath18 ; if the spin axes tend to be perpendicular , then the distribution of @xmath0 will be weighted toward @xmath19 @xcite . employing this method , @xcite , with a sample of 57 pairs of spirals , and",
    "@xcite , with 218 pairs of spirals , found distributions for @xmath0 that were statistically consistent with being uniform from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ; these results are consistent with , but do not demand , uncorrelated spin vectors . by contrast",
    ", @xcite , using a sample of 390 pairs of spirals , found a significant excess of pairs with @xmath22 , indicating a tendency for spin axes to be perpendicular .",
    "the second method for studying the relative orientation of spiral galaxies uses the apparent axis ratio @xmath23 of each galaxy image in addition to the angle @xmath0 between their apparent major axes .",
    "if each galaxy is approximated as an oblate spheroid of intrinsic short - to - long axis ratio @xmath24 , then the inclination @xmath25 of a galaxy with apparent axis ratio @xmath23 is given by the usual relation @xmath26 now consider a pair of disk galaxies , with inclinations @xmath27 and @xmath28 , that have an angle @xmath0 between their apparent major axes .",
    "if the angular separation of the galaxies is small , then the angle @xmath3 between their spin axes , defined so that @xmath29 , is given by the relation @xmath30 the two - fold ambiguity in @xmath31 is due to the tilt ambiguity of the individual galaxies .",
    "( if the apparent major axis of a disk galaxy lies in the east - west direction , for example , we do nt generally know whether the northern or the southern half of the disk is closer to us . ) using this method , @xcite , with a sample of 586 pairs of galaxies , found that their spin axes tend to be parallel . however , this method is intrinsically unable to distinguish between parallel or anti - parallel spin vectors .",
    "the third method for studying relative orientation of spiral galaxies uses additional information to resolve the tilt ambiguity and spin ambiguity of disk galaxies .",
    "the tilt ambiguity ( `` is the northern or southern half of the disk closer to us ? '' ) can be resolved by looking at high - resolution images of a disk galaxy and assuming that dust lanes lie on the outer edge of spiral arms .",
    "the spin ambiguity ( `` is the disk rotating clockwise or counterclockwise from our point of view ? '' ) can be resolved , if the galaxy is close to face - on , by looking at the chirality of the disk s spiral arms and assuming that spiral arms are trailing .",
    "either of these two pieces of information  location of dust lanes and chirality of spiral arms  can be replaced by spectroscopic information about which half of the disk is redshifted relative to the galaxy s nucleus and which is blueshifted .",
    "the additional information lets us find the angle @xmath9 between the spin vectors of the galaxies , defined so that @xmath32 .",
    "using this method , @xcite , with a sample of 31 pairs of galaxies , found that spin vectors tend to be anti - parallel ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "@xcite , using a sample of 40 pairs , found that their spin vectors were uncorrelated .",
    "@xcite used a sample of 46 pairs of galaxies , largely drawn from the study of @xcite , but discarded the information that resolved the spin ambiguity ; they then found a tendency for spin axes to be either parallel or perpendicular , with a shortage of pairs at @xmath34 .",
    "all three methods outlined above for determining relative orientations have shortcomings . determining the angle @xmath9 between the spin vectors of two spiral galaxies requires high - resolution imaging or spatially resolved spectroscopy . in practice",
    ", this has limited sample size ; @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all had @xmath35 pairs in their samples .",
    "in addition , the assumptions must be made that dust lanes are on the outside of spiral arms and that spiral arms are trailing ; these assumptions are not invariably true . determining the angle @xmath3 between the spin axes",
    "requires knowing only the apparent axis ratio @xmath23 for each disk and the angle @xmath0 between their major axes ; this can be found from lower resolution images , and permits larger sample sizes .",
    "however , because of the tilt ambiguity of each disk image , the distribution of @xmath3 is not , in the general case , determined uniquely .",
    "in addition , the assumptions must be made that disks are axisymmetric and that their intrinsic short - to - long axis ratio is known ; these assumptions are not perfectly true . determining the distribution of @xmath0 , the angle between the apparent major axes of binary spiral galaxies ,",
    "can be done for even low - resolution images ; smearing by the point spread function ( psf ) will increase @xmath23 for a galaxy , but will not strongly affect the position angle unless the psf is severely asymmetric .",
    "this permits large sample sizes .",
    "however , even a perfect knowledge of the distribution @xmath36 does not yield a unique solution for @xmath37 , the underlying distribution of angles between the spin vectors .",
    "the problem of determining the relative orientation of disks in binary spiral galaxies is a difficult one .",
    "different investigators , even those using similar techniques or overlapping data sets , find very different conclusions .",
    "these range from random orientation of spin axes @xcite , to a tendency for axes to be parallel @xcite , to a tendency for axes to be perpendicular @xcite , to a tendency for axes to be either parallel or perpendicular @xcite .",
    "our plunge into these troubled waters begins with selecting a sample of close pairs of disk galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey , as described in section  [ sec - data ] . our initial analysis , described in section  [ sec - phi ] looks at the distribution of @xmath0 , the angle between apparent major axes , for a relatively large ( @xmath38 ) sample of isolated pairs of galaxies .",
    "then , in section  [ sec - beta ] , we add information about the apparent axis ratios @xmath23 to find the distribution of @xmath3 , the angle between rotation axes . to eliminate the ambiguity in equation  ( [ eq : cosbeta ] )",
    ", we look only at the @xmath39 isolated pairs for which at least one of the galaxies is nearly face - on ( @xmath40 ) or nearly edge - on ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - disc ] , we discuss the implication of our results for the acquisition and evolution of angular momentum in binary spiral galaxies .",
    "we draw our sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey data release 6 ( sdss dr6 ) , which includes 9853 square degrees of photometric coverage and 7425 square degrees of spectroscopic coverage @xcite .",
    "the photometric imaging is done in 5 bands ( @xmath42 ) ; in this paper , we will use the imaging data in the @xmath43 band . to build our sample ,",
    "we start by selecting primary photometric objects that are classified as `` galaxies '' ( @xmath44 ) in the @xmath43 band and that have spectroscopic data with spectroscopic confidence parameter @xmath45 .",
    "we require that the redshift of each galaxy lie in the range @xmath46 ; the lower limit on @xmath47 eliminates contaminating foreground objects , and the upper limit reduces the possibility of weak lensing distortions of apparent shapes , and eliminates in practice the necessity of applying k - corrections . to ensure that the galaxies in this sample are well resolved , we include only those images with @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the adaptive second - order moment of the galaxy image and @xmath50 is the adaptive second - order moment of the psf at the galaxy s location .",
    "the sample of galaxies satisfying these constraints contains @xmath51 individual galaxies .    to extract a subsample of rotationally supported disk galaxies from our sample of @xmath52 galaxies , we start by using the sdss parameter `` fracdev '' , which provides a measure of the central concentration of a galaxy s light profile . for each galaxy image ,",
    "two models are fitted .",
    "one model has a de vaucouleurs profile @xcite : @xmath53 \\right ) \\ , \\ ] ] truncated beyond @xmath54 to go smoothly to zero at @xmath55 .",
    "the other model has an exponential profile : @xmath56 \\right ) \\ , \\ ] ] truncated beyond @xmath57 to go smoothly to zero at @xmath58 .",
    "the sdss data pipeline then takes the best - fitting de vaucouleurs model and the best - fitting exponential model , and finds the linear combination of the two that best fits the galaxy image .",
    "the fraction of the total flux contributed by the de vaucouleurs component is the parameter fracdev , which is constrained to lie in the interval @xmath59 .",
    "previous studies using sdss galaxies have used different cuts in fracdev to separate late - type ( low fracdev ) galaxies from early - type ( high fracdev ) galaxies . @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "in their studies of late - type galaxies , found it useful to choose a sample with @xmath60 . in this paper , however , our aim is to produce a sample of strongly disk - dominated spiral galaxies . to this end , we make a more stringent cut in the fracdev parameter , requiring @xmath61 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that relatively luminous ( @xmath62 ) galaxies with @xmath63 have the properties expected of dusty , disk - dominated spiral galaxies : they lie primarily in the blue cloud of the color  magnitude diagram and they have colors and fluxes that are dependent on the apparent axis ratio @xmath23 , with smaller values of @xmath23 corresponding to redder , fainter galaxies .",
    "moreover , visual inspection of sdss `` postage stamp '' images reveals that galaxies with @xmath62 and @xmath63 appear to be primarily of hubble type sbc or sc @xcite .",
    "the inclination - dependent dimming found by @xcite in their sample of @xmath63 galaxies is well fitted by the relation @xmath64 . because the dimming by dust is inclination dependent ,",
    "a simple flux - limited survey , such as the sdss spectroscopic survey , will be biased against disks that are nearly edge - on ( low @xmath23 ) . to provide a correction for this inclination - related bias",
    ", we require that all galaxies in our final sample would be above the flux limit if they were seen edge - on .",

    "@xcite found that @xmath63 galaxies dimmer than @xmath69 have a @xmath70 color that is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "the lack of inclination - dependent reddening for the relatively low - luminosity galaxies reflects the fact that they are blue ( @xmath71 ) dwarf galaxies in which the stars and dust are not in orderly thin disks . to eliminate the dwarf galaxies from our sample , we start by following @xcite in computing an approximate face - on absolute magnitude for each galaxy : @xmath72 to exclude the dwarfs , we require that @xmath73",
    ". throughout this paper , when computing distances and absolute magnitudes , we assume a consensus cosmology with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    applying the additional criteria that @xmath61 , @xmath68 , and @xmath73 , we reduce our sample size from @xmath51 galaxies to @xmath77 luminous , disk - dominated spiral galaxies . to select binary spiral galaxies from this sample ,",
    "we require that the redshift difference between two disk galaxies corresponds to a radial velocity difference @xmath78 , and that the projected separation between them be @xmath79 . to ensure that the binary system is relatively isolated",
    ", we also require that no other galaxy in the sdss dr6 spectroscopic survey be within @xmath80 and @xmath81 of either spiral galaxy in the binary system .",

    "if we had chosen @xmath83 as our critical radial velocity difference ( both for defining binaries and for defining isolated binaries ) , then we would have ended with @xmath84 isolated binary spiral systems , and the qualitative results of our study would have been unchanged .    as a control",
    ", it will be useful to have a sample of luminous disk galaxies that are not part of a binary spiral system , and that are relatively isolated from bright galaxies of all types . to select a sample of isolated disks from our sample of @xmath77 luminous , disk - dominated spiral galaxies , we require that no other galaxy in the sdss dr6 spectroscopic survey be within @xmath80 and @xmath81 of the spiral galaxy in question .",

    "however , it is known that sloan galaxies in close pairs have a significantly different distribution in redshift and stellar mass than non - paired sloan galaxies @xcite . thus , to ensure that the control galaxies are similar in their properties to the galaxies in pairs , we adapt the method of @xcite for finding a _ matched _ control sample .",
    "we first go down the list of @xmath86 disk galaxies in pairs , and find the isolated galaxy which best matches the redshift of each paired galaxy ; once an isolated galaxy is matched to a paired galaxy , it is removed from further consideration .",
    "this gives a sample of 1494 isolated galaxies that are very closely matched in redshift to the galaxies in pairs . to increase the number of galaxies in our matched control sample , we iterate this procedure until the redshift distribution of the matched control sample deviates significantly from that of the galaxies in pairs .",
    "we found that 7 iterations gave a ks probability of @xmath87 for comparison of the redshift distributions ; going to an 8th iteration dropped the probability to @xmath88 .",

    "the redshift distributions for the disks in pairs and the matched control sample are nearly indistinguishable ( and in fact yield a ks probability of nearly one ) .",
    "note that although we selected our matched control sample on the basis of redshift , and not on both redshift and estimated stellar mass , as @xcite did , we find that selecting purely on redshift gives similar ( but not identical ) distributions in color and absolute magnitude .",

    "for 747 close pairs of galaxies , the distribution of @xmath0 , the angle between the galaxies projected major axes , is consistent with a uniform distribution between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this is consistent with disks that are randomly oriented with respect to each other .",
    "looking solely at @xmath0 , however , does nt use all the available information .",
    "computing @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the angle between the rotation axes of the disks , makes use of additional information  the apparent axis ratios of the two galaxies ( equations  [ eq : cosi ] and [ eq : cosbeta ] ) .",
    "taking advantage of the loss of tilt ambiguity when one disk is face - on or edge - on , we can compute the distribution of @xmath2 for these special pairs .",
    "looking at 171 close pairs with an edge - on galaxy and 94 close pairs containing a face - on galaxy reveals no statistically significant tendency for the two disk galaxies in a pair to be either parallel to each other ( @xmath149 ) or perpendicular to each other ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "we find one curious result that is consistent with correlated orientations .",
    "in relatively high - density neighborhoods ( more than 6 bright neighboring galaxies with @xmath151 ) , face - on galaxies within a close pair have an unusually high probability of having a edge - on partner ; although just 4.9% of all disk galaxies in our sample have @xmath146 , 6 out of 42 partners of face - on galaxies in high - density neighborhoods have @xmath146 .",
    "the physical significance of this statistically significant result is unclear .    obviously , the toy model for angular momentum acquisition , in which a pair of protogalaxies spin each other up and have antiparallel spin vectors and a tiny orbital angular momentum , is inconsistent with our results .",
    "acquisition of spin angular momentum is supplied by torques from an array of protogalaxies and protogroups in the vicinity . moreover",
    ", the initial angular momentum of a disk , acquired by tidal torques , can be modified by encounters and late infall .",
    "the continuing process of acquiring and modifying angular momentum appears , from our results , to produce binary spiral galaxies that have random relative orientations of their stellar disks .",
