    "we study an optimal control problem in the discrete case whose control system is given by the following system of nonlinear partial differential equations , @xmath0 which result from a well established model for oil engineering within the framework of the mechanics of a continuous medium @xcite .",
    "the domain @xmath1 is an open bounded set in @xmath2 with a sufficiently smooth boundary .",
    "further hypotheses on the data of the problem will be specified later .    at the time of the first run of a layer , the flow of the crude oil towards the surface is due to the energy stored in the gases under pressure in the natural hydraulic system . to mitigate the consecutive decline of production and the decomposition of the site ,",
    "water injections are carried out , well before the normal exhaustion of the layer .",
    "the water is injected through wells with high pressure , by pumps specially drilled to this end .",
    "the pumps allow the displacement of the crude oil towards the wells of production .",
    "more precisely , the problem consists in seeking the admissible control parameters which minimize a certain objective functional . in our problem ,",
    "the main goal is to distribute properly the wells in order to have the best extraction of the hydrocarbons .",
    "for this reason , we consider a cost functional containing different parameters arising in the process . to address the optimal control problem",
    ", we use the lagrangian method to derive an optimality system : from the cost function we introduce a lagrangian ; then , we calculate the gteaux derivative of the lagrangian with respect to its variables .",
    "this technique was used , in particular , by a.  masserey  et al . for electromagnetic models of induction heating @xcite , and by h",
    "lee and t.  shilkin for the thermistor problem @xcite .",
    "we consider the following cost functional : @xmath3 the control parameters are the reduced saturation of oil @xmath4 , the pressure @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . the coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two coefficients of penalization , and @xmath9 .",
    "the first two terms in allow to minimize the difference between the reduced saturation of oil @xmath4 , the global pressure @xmath5 and the given data @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the third and fourth terms are used to improve the quality of exploitation of the crude oil .",
    "we take @xmath12 just for the sake of simplicity .",
    "it is important to emphasize that our choice of the cost function is not unique .",
    "one can always add additional terms of penalization to take into account other properties which one may wish to control .",
    "recently , we proved in @xcite results of existence , uniqueness , and regularity of the optimal solutions to the problem of minimizing subject to , using the theory of parabolic problems @xcite . here , our goal is to obtain necessary optimality conditions which may be easily implemented on a computer .",
    "more precisely , we address the problem of obtaining necessary optimality conditions for the semi - discretized time problem .    in order to be able",
    "to solve problem - numerically , we use discretization of the problem in time by a method of finite differences . for a fixed real @xmath13 ,",

    "we denote by @xmath18 an approximation of @xmath4 .",
    "the discrete cost functional is then defined as follows : @xmath19 it is now possible to state our optimal control problem : find @xmath20 which minimizes among all functions @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 the soughtafter necessary optimality conditions are proved in ",
