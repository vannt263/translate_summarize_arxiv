    "measurement of the surface impedance @xmath8 in high-@xmath9 superconductors ( hts ) in the microwave frequency range is one of the most effective and frequently used methods to study electron properties and mechanisms of superconductivity in these materials .",
    "such measurements , performed on high quality hts single crystals or perfect single - crystalline films , allow to obtain in a straightforward way the temperature and frequency dependencies of the complex ac conductivity of the materials @xmath10 in the microwave frequency range , that in turn yield a complimentary information on microscopic electron properties of hts , such as low - energy quasiparticle excitations from the superfluid condensate , their scattering rate and density of states , the symmetry of cooper pairing , etc .",
    "numerous experimental and theoretical studies of the microwave response carried out during the last decade have revealed a lot of interesting features of the superconducting state in hts metal - oxide compounds and partly shed a light on the nature of superconductivity in these materials ( e.g. , _",
    "d_wave type of cooper pairing).@xcite    however , up to date there is no comprehensive understanding of microwave response in hts . in particular",
    ", this concerns the temperature dependence of surface resistance @xmath11 in highly perfect single crystals and epitaxial films , where nonmonotonous character of this dependence with a wide peak below @xmath9 was observed by many investigators .",
    "unfortunately , there are still some difficulties in its understanding and explanation in the framework of existing theoretical models.@xcite in the present work we demonstrate for the first time that the nonmonotonous character of @xmath4 in epitaxially - grown single - crystalline ybco films can be even more complicated than it was suggested before : in our experiments @xmath4 curves have two distinct rather narrow peaks at quite different temperatures @xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 2530  k , @xmath14  k ) .",
    "this observation clearly indicates that the microscopic scenario of electron properties in hts ( ybco ) is more intriguing and sophisticated than it was assumed before .",
    "the temperature dependence of microwave surface resistance , @xmath4 , in ybco perfect single crystals@xcite and epitaxially grown single - crystalline thin films@xcite observed in a number of experiments performed by different groups , turned out to be nonmonotonous and revealed a pronounced broad peak at @xmath15 .",
    "the temperature position and height of the peak depend on frequency and crystal quality .",
    "it was shown also that the peculiarity of @xmath4 is very sensitive to the crystal defect density .",
    "for instance , impurities ( point defects ) suppress the peak of @xmath4.@xcite analysis of these experimental data , based on the phenomenological approach assuming the drude form of microwave conductivity for thermally excited quasiparticles @xmath16 ^{-1}$],@xcite sheds a light on the nature of observed @xmath17 peaks and explains also ( at least qualitatively ) its frequency dependence and suppression of the peak by impurities.@xcite this approach allows also to extract the value of quasiparticle relaxation time @xmath18 directly from microwave measurements of @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath18 value in perfect single crystals appears to be strongly increasing with the temperature lowering and reaching the saturation value of order @xmath19@xmath20  s at low temperatures ( below 20  k).@xcite    in the present work the @xmath21 dependencies are studied experimentally and theoretically for the most perfect ybco films in order to establish relation between the microwave response and the defect nanostructure .",
    "the first observation of two - peak behavior of the @xmath11 as well as @xmath22 dependencies is presented and a relevant theoretical model is developed .",
    "two - peak temperature dependencies of microwave surface resistance , @xmath4 , have been observed for the first time in _ c_oriented perfect ybco thin films of various thickness ( @xmath23 150480 nm ) deposited by off - axis dc magnetron sputtering onto ceo@xmath1-buffered r - cut single - crystalline sapphire substrates of 14 @xmath24 14 mm@xmath25 size .",
    "microwave measurements were performed with a use of cylindrical pure copper cavities 2 , 4 and 8 mm in diameter .",
    "one of flat bases of the cavity was a film under study .",
    "the measurements were performed using @xmath2 mode at the frequencies of 134 , 65 and 34 ghz .",
    "several dc off - axis magnetron sputtered ( ms ) , as well as pulse laser deposited ( pld ) , ybco films have been measured in the temperature range from 18 to 100 k. some films revealed a distinct two - peak structure of @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependencies with peaks at 2530  k and 4851  k ( figs .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , [ fig.4 ] ) .",
    "the peaks are much more pronounced at the lower frequency , while their temperature positions remain almost unchanged at any frequency . for less perfect films ( e.g. , pld ) characterized by a higher density of crystal lattice defects ,",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependencies appear to be monotonous ( power law ) and similar to those obtained in previous works.@xcite the two - peak peculiarity observed for both @xmath4 and @xmath5 is believed to be an intrinsic electronic feature of perfect quasi - single - crystalline ybco films .",
    "the two - peak behavior is not detected in much smaller ybco single crystals and in experiments with a use of strip - line resonator measurement technique , which requires film patterning .",
    "temperature dependencies of the surface resistance @xmath26 for three films ( # 48 , # 35 and # 10 ) at 34 ghz .",
    "@xmath26 for cu is shown for comparison . ]",
    "temperature dependencies of the penetration depth @xmath27 for the film # 35 at three different frequencies . ]",
    "the observed dependence differs from that for perfect ybco single crystals , for which only one much broader frequency dependent peak of @xmath4 was detected.@xcite some peculiarities of the two - peak character of @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependencies are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.4][fig.5 ] .",

    "[ fig.4 ] for the same three frequencies .",
    "[ fig.5 ] demonstrates the effect of aging and the influence of applied dc magnetic field on the two - peak structure of @xmath4 .",
    "one can see that the specimen aging as well as application of dc magnetic field lead to smearing of the peaks .",

    "effects of aging and applied dc magnetic field on the @xmath26 dependence of the film # 35 at 34 ghz . ]",
    "it is well known@xcite that in superconductors at microwave frequencies and not too high temperatures ( @xmath31 ) usually one has @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the real part of microwave conductivity of superconductor @xmath34 .",
    "so , the observed scaling of the @xmath35 curves shown in fig .  [ fig.3 ] means that @xmath33 , which is determined by the contribution of thermally excited quasiparticles , almost does not depend on frequency within the studied frequency range : @xmath36 except the vicinity of peaks , where it is falling down rapidly with the increase of frequency .",
    "the @xmath37 behavior is rather similar as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] .",
    "thus , our experiments on perfect single - crystalline ybco films have revealed the new type of nonmonotonous two - peak temperature dependence of @xmath38 , essentially different from the single - peak nonmonotonous behavior observed before for perfect single crystals and films .",
    "it should be noted also , that these observed for the first time two peaks of @xmath7 dependence for the most perfect films are much more narrow in the temperature scale than the single peak of @xmath7 for single crystals mentioned above.@xcite quite similarly to the case of single crystals , these peaks become suppressed , when frequency increases or for less perfect specimens .",
    "the substantial difference between @xmath11 values of ybco epitaxially - grown highly biaxially - oriented films and ybco single crystals is shown to exist , increasing with temperature , @xmath39 .",
    "this difference is supposed to be due to essentially different crystal defect spectra in ybco epitaxial films and single crystals .",
    "perfect quasi - single - crystalline yba@xmath40cu@xmath41o@xmath42 films exhibit several times higher microwave surface resistance than ybco single crystals .",
    "a different dimensionality of crystal defects in ybco single crystals and thin films is supposed to be responsible for the difference . in general ,",
    "two major types of crystal defects ( point and planar , i.e. , oxygen vacancies and twins ) are known to be most essential for electromagnetic behavior of ybco single crystals . the nonmonotonous @xmath43 dependence with a large broad peak is mostly pronounced in untwined crystals , where only point defects are essential for electron scattering at low temperatures.@xcite in a contrast , _",
    "c_oriented extended defects , such as out - of - plane dislocations@xcite and twin boundaries , which in the case of ybco films usually form much more dense network than in single crystals,@xcite are currently shown to be the most important ones for perfect epitaxially grown ybco films . despite the perfect crystallinity , different types of linear defects ( dislocations ) , as well as dislocation arrays , have been identified by tem / hrem in these films.@xcite in order to understand the high - frequency electromagnetic behavior of these films , the existence of edge dislocations arrays should be taken into account , in particular , out - of - plane edge dislocations , associated with low - angle tilt dislocation boundaries .",
    "tem / hrem / xrd / afm characterization of the films under study revealed a smooth surface ( peak - to - valley is 2 nm ) , high average in - plane density of out - of - plane edge dislocations ( @xmath44@xmath45  @xmath46 ) and a big size of single - crystalline domains ( @xmath47 = 250  nm ) , which are separated by low - angle dislocation boundaries . in - plane misalignment of the domains",
    "is as low as 0.51.0@xmath48.@xcite    basing on this difference of defect structures of ybco perfect films and single crystals , in the next section we will suggest a model , which can explain ( at least qualitatively ) the main features of the observed two - peak nonmonotonous behavior of @xmath4 dependence in perfect ybco films , as well as the difference from a single - peak @xmath4 dependence in single crystals .",
    "the value of microwave surface resistance @xmath11 in a linear regime of microwave response of superconductor at zero applied dc magnetic field is directly determined by the real part @xmath33 of high - frequency electron conductivity @xmath10 of superconductor : @xmath49 while the surface reactance @xmath22 is determined by the ac penetration depth @xmath37 , which in principle may be different from the london penetration depth @xmath50 : @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the contribution of excited quasiparticles to the screening properties of superconductor .",
    "thus , the observed peaks of @xmath4 dependence reveal also the temperature dependence of @xmath33 , because the london penetration depth @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) is a monotonous function of temperature .",
    "similarly , peaks in @xmath5 and @xmath27 dependencies accordingly to eqs .",
    "( [ xs ] ) , ( [ lambda ] ) are related also to the contribution of the normal component of electron fluid .",
    "the @xmath54 value is generally ascribed to the contribution of `` normal '' component of electron fluid to the ac conductivity in the framework of so - called `` two - fluid '' model of superconductor .",
    "it should be mentioned that the phenomenological `` two - fluid '' model , which is frequently used for description of microwave properties of superconductors , @xcite also follows from the microscopic bcs theory .",
    "a very essential feature of the microscopic approach is that the role of normal component of electron fluid in superconductor is played by a gas of bogolyubov quasiparicles , which are determined as a superposition of electron and hole states in a normal fermi liquid . due to this circumstance",
    ", the normal electron fluid in superconductors has quite different properties comparatively to those in a normal metal.@xcite we will take into account the peculiarities of the `` normal '' electron fluid of bogolyubov quasiparticles in superconductor and will show that the principal features of hts microwave response , including the observed two peaks of @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependencies , can be qualitatively explained using the boltzman kinetic equation approach for bogolyubov quasiparticles with a few additional assumptions about the symmetry of superconducting state in hts and its dependence on the concentration of static defects ( impurities , oxygen vacancies , dislocations , etc . ) .",
    "namely , we will assume that the case of anisotropic _",
    "s_+_d _ pairing is realized@xcite ( see fig .  [ fig.6 ] ) :     schematic representation of anisotropic pairing and scattering processes : ( a ) 3d scattering on point - like defects ; ( b ) in - plane scattering on extended defects ; ( c ) scattering of quasiparticles in the momentum space in the case of _",

    "this approach is well known and was widely used for theoretical consideration of electron kinetic properties in normal metals.@xcite due to its relative simplicity it allows in principle to take into account peculiarities of electron spectrum and fermi surface in hts@xcite as well as different mechanisms of electron scattering .",
    "this approach was argued on the base of microscopic bcs theory in the quasiclassical limit for quasiparticles in superconducting state.@xcite the boltzman equation in this case may be written in the form:@xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the energy of quasiparticles ; @xmath61 is the energy of a normal electron in a vicinity of the fermi surface , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the fermi velocity and momentum , respectively , @xmath64 is the equilibrium fermi distribution function of quasiparticles , @xmath65 is the group velocity of quasiparticles , @xmath66 is the quasiparticle charge , which is different from the normal electron charge @xmath67 , because a bogolyubov quasiparticle is a superposition of electron and hole states in the fermi liquid,@xcite @xmath68 is the relaxation time of quasiparticles , which in the case of elastic scattering by static defects can be calculated from the following well known expression:@xcite @xmath69    integration in eq .",

    "@xmath73wave pairing and scattering on point - like defects this dependence can be estimated as:@xcite @xmath74    so , @xmath75 diverges at the edge of the gap when @xmath76 and the group velocity @xmath77 goes to zero . for the sake of simplicity we have assumed in eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) that all defects in the crystal lattice are identical and can be characterized by the same matrix element @xmath70 .",
    "if there are several kinds of scattering defects , e.g. , point - like ( oxygen vacancies ) and extended ones ( dislocations , twin boundaries ) oriented along the @xmath78axis , as they usually are in the case of epitaxial films and as it was discussed in the previous section , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) that : @xmath79    the energy dependencies of the relaxation rates in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tau1 ] ) for point - like and extended defects may be quite different because point like defects can scatter electrons in all directions of momentum space , while scattering on extended defects can proceed only with a conservation of momentum along the @xmath78axis .",
    "this becomes especially important for layered hts materials , where electrons move mainly within cu - o layers . in the case of _ d_wave or assumed _ s_+_d _ ( or other type ) anisotropic pairing ,",
    "an additional strong dependence of the relaxation time on the quasiparticles energy @xmath80 has to appear due to a confinement of momentum space , where the quasiparticle can be scattered , with a decrease of @xmath80 .",
    "this effect follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) due to the @xmath81function term in the integrand . in a certain sense , this effect can be considered as an analogue of andreev reflection of quasiparticles in the momentum space ( fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] ) .",
    "the confinement of momentum space for quasiparticle scattering is mostly essential for the scattering on extended defects , leading to a very rapid increase of @xmath82 , when @xmath83 decreases and approaches the value @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) as it is shown in fig .",

    "quite formally this solution can be rewritten in the drude - like form : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the effective concentration of thermally excited quasiparticles , @xmath93 denotes thermal averaging . as it was originally supposed in refs.@xcite , the nonmonotonous character and appearance of @xmath26 peak dependence as well as its frequency dependence can be explained properly by a strong increase of quasiparticle relaxation time with temperature lowering according to the drude expression for the ac conductivity @xmath33 .",
    "the peak position corresponds to the condition @xmath94 .",
    "we suppose that this explanation is valid also in our case , when two peaks are observed . the emergence of two peaks instead of one can be explained by existence of two different @xmath84 values for the assumed case of _",

[ fig.6 ] ) , while the sharpness of these peaks comparatively to the peak in single crystals is determined by a very strong energy dependence of the relaxation time ( eq .  ( [ tau2 ] ) ) , when quasiparicles are scattered preferably by extended defects ( see fig .  [ fig.7 ] ) .",
    "this strong energy dependence of @xmath95 transforms into sharp peaks of @xmath96 according to eq .",
    "( [ drude ] ) .",
    "the present model can explain also some additional features of the microwave response of ybco films , such as ( i )  smearing of peaks with the frequency increase , ( ii )  lowering of @xmath26 and smearing of peaks with an increase of point - like defect concentration , ( iii )  general quasi - linear behavior of @xmath26 at moderate temperatures .",
    "the obtained results shown in figs .  [ fig.1][fig.5 ] , that is the nonmonotonous two - peak structure of @xmath38 in perfect single - crystalline ybco epitaxial films , is a strong argument for the scenario of anisotropic electron pairing in hts .",
    "the observed for the first time two - peak peculiarity of @xmath7 dependence for the most perfect single - crystalline ybco films , as well as the difference from nonmonotonous @xmath38 dependence for perfect single crystals ( and also some less perfect films ) , can be explained , using just two assumptions : ( i )  the anisotropic _ s_+_d _ character of electron pairing and ( ii )  the dominant role of extended _ c_oriented defects in electron scattering processes .",
    "these assumptions look quite natural with regard to thin films , where surfaces and/or twin boundaries can lead to more complicated character of electron pairing than the pure _ d_wave pairing in perfect single crystals.@xcite on the other hand , the extended @xmath78oriented linear or planar defects ( most probably , out - of - plane edge dislocations and twins ) can play a dominant role in electron scattering . in the case of untwined single crystals",
    "there are no extended defects .",
    "therefore , only point defects are essential for electron scattering at low temperatures .",
    "the above two assumptions , which seem to be specific for thin films , distinguish them from single crystals and , thus , provide the difference in microwave response : one broad peak of @xmath4 for single crystals and two sharp peaks for perfect films . for less perfect films with a higher number of point defects and in the case when only pure _ d_wave pairing takes place , their behavior at microwave frequencies is rather similar to that of single crystals .",
    "the observed two peaks of @xmath4 are much more narrow comparatively to the single peak for perfect single crystals due to different defect structures in films and single crystals as it was discussed above .",
    "namely , a large number of extended defects along with an anisotropic pairing can lead to emergence of a sharp peak at @xmath97 as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "the second peak at a lower temperature is caused by the anisotropy of pairing potential ( existence of two different values @xmath84 for different directions in momentum space in the case of _",

    "the present model for quasiparticle conductivity allows also to understand the frequency dependence of the observed peculiarities and their smearing , when the number of point - like defects increases leading to an increase of @xmath98 .",
    "it should be noted , that in a contrast to suggestions made in some theoretical works , it does not seem to be necessary to take into account a contribution of inelastic quasiparticle scattering by collective excitations ( magnons , phonons , etc . ) .",
    "the two - peak temperature dependence of @xmath33 can occur in accordance to eq .",
    "( [ drude ] ) even in the case of elastic scattering by extended static defects due to additional effect of anisotropy caused by anisotropic _",

    "the @xmath26 dependence in less perfect films is monotonous .",
    "we suppose that the two - peak character of @xmath26 , observed experimentally for the first time , is an intrinsic fundamental property and reveals the peculiarities of anisotropic electron pairing , which manifests in the microwave electron response and can be properly described using the boltzman kinetic equation approach for bogolyubov quasiparticles .",
