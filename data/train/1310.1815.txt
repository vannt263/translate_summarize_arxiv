    "the method is based on weighted cumulative line - widths @xmath3 defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the residual flux ( intensity ) and @xmath6 is the abundance of studied element or isotope .",
    "the derivative of residual flux @xmath7 with respect to abundance @xmath8 automatically excludes spectral regions insensitive to changes of the abundance of studied element and gives a large contribution in the most sensitive regions , i.  e. in the centres of non - saturated lines and in the steep wings of strong lines of the element .",
