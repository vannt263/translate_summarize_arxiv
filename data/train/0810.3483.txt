    "hadronic b - meson decays play importance role not only for understanding the dynamical scheme of hadronic decays and testing the flavor structure of the standard model(sm ) , but also for probing the origin of cp violation and new physics signals beyond the sm . in particular , the precise measurement and systematic study for hadronic charmless b decays may provide a window for such purposes .",
    "the branching ratios of @xmath5 and @xmath6 modes have been measured with a good accuracy@xcite and a large direct cp violation has been established in @xmath7 mode @xcite .",
    "the most severe discrepancies between the experimental data and theoretical predictions come from the unexpected large branch ratio of @xmath8 and some unclear cp violations in @xmath9 decays , which are called @xmath10 puzzles@xcite .",
    "theoretically , to predict consistently those decays , it needs to deal with the short - distance contributions in a complete and systematic way from the high energy scale to a proper low energy scale at which the perturbative calculations remain reliable , and treat the long - distance contributions which contain the non - perturbative strong interactions involved in those decays .",
    "the main task is to reliably compute the hadronic matrix elements between the initial and final hadron states .",
    "several novel methods based on the naive factorization approach ( fa ) and four quark operator effective hamiltonian have been developed to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements , such as the qcd factorization approach ( qcdf)@xcite , the perturbation qcd method ( pqcd ) @xcite , and the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet)@xcite .",
    "these methods have been widely used in analyzing hadronic b - meson decays and made great progresses in understanding the hadronic structure and properties of strong interactions . to understand the puzzles whether they are due to the unknown new physics or it is because of the lack of our knowledge on the hadronic properties of strong interactions , it still needs to investigate further the various approaches within the framework of qcd and to check the validity of assumptions and approximations made in the practical calculations .",
    "the widely used theoretical framework of weak decays is based on the current - current four fermion operator effective hamiltonian derived via operator product expansion and renormalization group evolution . in hadronic weak decays ,",
    "the short - distance contributions of qcd are characterized by the wilson coefficient functions of four quark operators and the long - distance contributions are in principle obtained by evaluating the hadronic matrix elements of four quark operators .",
    "the wilson coefficient functions are in general calculated by perturbative qcd which is well developed , while the evaluation of hadronic matrix elements remains a hard task as it involves non - perturbative effects of qcd .",
    "to deepen our insights into the hadronic decays , we shall first reinvestigate the four quark operator effective hamiltonian whether it is always suitable as a basic framework for all hadronic weak decays .",
    "in fact , for the mesonic two body decays of b meson , it concerns three quark - antiquark pairs once each meson is regarded as the quark - antiquark bound state at the quark level structure .",
    "this fact then naturally motivates us to consider six - quark operator effective hamiltonian instead of four - quark operator effective hamiltonian .",
    "namely , we shall begin with six quark diagrams of weak decays with both w - boson exchange and gluon exchange , and derive formally the six - quark operator effective hamiltonian based on operator product expansion and renormalization group evolution when including loop corrections of six quark diagrams",
    ". we shall show how this approach allows us to figure out what are the assumptions and approximations made in effective four quark operator approach , and how the simple qcd factorization scheme can reliably be applied to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements with the six quark operator effective hamiltonian .",
    "for the infrared singularity caused by the gluon exchanging interaction when evaluating the hadronic matrix elements of effective six quark operators , it is shown to be simply treated by the introduction of a mass scale motivated from the gauge invariant loop regularization method  @xcite , where the energy scale @xmath11 is introduced to play the role of infrared cut - off energy scale without violating gauge invariance .",

    "sqeh ] , after briefly reviewing the four quark operator effective hamiltonian , we begin with the primary six quark diagrams with a single w - boson exchange and a single gluon exchange , and the corresponding initial six - quark operator .",

    "emission and annihilation diagram contributions are automatically the consequences of qcd factorization for the hadronic matrix elements of effective six quark operators .",

    "the index @xmath24 in the summation of the above operators runs through @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath28 transition can be obtained by changing @xmath29 into @xmath30 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hpk])and ( [ eq : o ] ) .      as mesons are regarded as quark and anti - quark bound states , the mesonic two body decays actually involve three quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "it is then natural to consider the six quark feynman diagrams which lead to three effective currents of quark - antiquark .",
    "the initial six quark diagrams of weak decays contain one w - boson exchange and one gluon exchange , thus there are four different diagrams as the gluon exchange interaction can occur for each of four quarks in the w - boson exchange diagram , see fig .",
    "[ pic:4insert ] .",
    "+    the resulting initial effective operators contain four terms corresponding to the four diagrams , respectively . in a good approximation",
    ", the four quarks via w - boson exchange can be regarded as a local four quark interaction at the energy scale much below the w - boson mass , while two qcd vertexes due to gluon exchange are at the independent space - time points , the resulting effective six quark operators are hence in general nonlocal .",
    "the six - quark operators corresponding to the four diagrams in fig .",
    "[ pic:4insert ] are found to be @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to the momenta of gluon and quark in their propagators .",

    "the color index is summed between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "note that all the six quark operators are proportional to the qcd coupling constant @xmath40 due to gluon exchange .",
    "thus the initial six quark operator is given by summing over the above four operators @xmath41    actually , the initial six quark operators @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) can be obtained from the following initial four quark operator via a single gluon exchange @xmath44      based on the above considerations with the introduction of six quark operators , in this section we shall specify the initial six quark operator @xmath45 @xmath46 to the case of nonleptonic bottom hadron decays and show how to obtain six quark operator effective hamiltonian .",
    "the initial six quark operator in b - decay with @xmath47 is as follows ( for the @xmath28 transition with @xmath48 , just replacing @xmath29 by @xmath30 ) @xmath49 which can be regarded as an effective operator resulting from the corresponding initial four - quark operator with a single gluon exchange @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",

    "as the first step for finding out the complete set of independent effective six quark operators , one needs to evaluate all possible one loop diagrams based on the initial six quark diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ pic:4insert ] ) .",
    "the possible six quark diagrams at one loop level are plotted in fig .",
    "[ pic : oneloop ] .",
    "+    it is useful to classify those diagrams into three types : type i is the loop diagrams in which only the effective four quark vertex of weak interaction receives loop corrections including the penguin type loops , the single gluon exchanging interaction for six quark operators remains mediating between one of four external quark lines of loops and a spectator quark line ( see fig .

    "is a hard task , as a good approximation , we shall pay attention to the type i and type ii diagrams .",
    "the type iii diagrams are in general suppressed at the perturbative region with energy scale around @xmath55 as they involve more internal quark lines and contain no large logarithmic enhancements . from the evaluation of four quark operator effective hamiltonian , it is known that when the energy scale runs via the renormalization group evolution from the high energy scale at @xmath56 to the low energy scale around @xmath54 , the loop corrections of type i diagrams should result in the six quark operators with all effective four quark operators and the corresponding wilson coefficient functions , meanwhile the loop corrections of type ii diagrams will lead the strong coupling constant @xmath40 of the gluon exchanging interaction to run from high energy scale at @xmath57 to the low energy scale at @xmath58 .",
