    "as is well known , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are characterized not only by the large range and bimodal distribution of their radio loudness , but also by jets of powering large - scale radio structure .",
    "it has been observed that agns can approximately be divided into two classes : radio - loud ( rl ) agns and radio - quiet ( rq ) agns . in 1989 , kellerman et al . indicated that rl agns are rather rare ( they consist only about 10% of the agn population ) and they almost reside in elliptical galaxies , having the ratio of their radio to optical fluxes @xmath0 .",
    "recently , cirasuolo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested that rl agns consist about 5% of the agn population or more less .",
    "blandford ( 1990 ) proposed the `` spin paradigm '' that the key parameter which determines the jet powers and radio loudness of agns is the black hole spin .",
    "wilson & colbert ( 1995 ) argued that high spin bhs exist only if formed by the coalescence of two bhs , which would take place mostly in the environment of elliptical galaxies .",
    "considering the fact that a bh is spun down much more effectively in retro - grade disc accretion than the pro - grade case , moderski et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter m97 ) proposed a model of switching randomly between pro- and retro - grade disc accretion with the blandford - znajek ( bz , 1977 ) process to explain the observed radio dichotomy of agns .",
    "phenomenologically , rl agns are always associated with large - scale radio jets and lobes , while the rq sources have very little or weak radio - emitting ejecta .",
    "this phenomenon means that there may exist a dramatic relation between jet powers and radio loudness of agns .",
    "the strength of the bz mechanism is related closely to accretion mode .",
    "recently , cao and rawlings ( 2004 ) argued that perhaps most of the 3cr fr i radio galaxies have normal accretion discs rather than advection dominated accretion flows or adiabatic inflow - outflow solution flows , otherwise the bz mechanism can not provide sufficient power to explain their high radio luminosities .    on the other hand ,",
    "the strength of the bz mechanism depends on the configuration of the magnetic field in bh accretion disc .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid on the magnetic coupling ( mc ) of a bh with its surrounding disc , and the recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of a broad fe @xmath1 line in the bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 suggested strongly the existence of the mc effects ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ; li 2002 ; wang et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b , hereafter w03a and w03b , respectively ) . in fact the mc process can be regarded as a variant of the bz process , in which energy and angular momentum are transferred from a fast - rotating bh to its surrounding disc .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the bz and mc processes might coexist , provided that the bh spin and the power - law index are greater than some critical values ( w03b ) .    in this paper",
    "we intend to clarify the correlation between jet powers and radio loudness of agns in the model of the coexistence of the bz and mc processes ( cebzmc ) on the basis of the normal accretion discs , assuming that the jet is powered in the bz process , and the energy transferred from a bh to the disc in the mc process contributes the bolometer luminosity of the disc as well as disc accretion .",
    "it turns out that both jet powers and radio loudness of agns do not depend on the bh spin only , but on the other physical parameters probably .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 radio loudness of agns",
    "is discussed in a parameter space consisting of the bh spin and the power - law index , and a reasonable explanation for the observed radio dichotomy of agns is given . in section 3 , the contours of jet powers of agns are analyzed , and the correlation of jet powers with radio loudness of agns is discussed also in the parameter space . finally , in section 4 , we discuss the correlation of the jet powers and radio loudness of agns with the position of the inner edge of an accretion disc , and summarize our main results . throughout this paper the geometric units",

    "since the configuration of magnetic field in bh magnetosphere is very complicated , we discussed magnetic extraction of energy from a rotating bh based on several simplified assumptions ( wang et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter w02 ) .",
