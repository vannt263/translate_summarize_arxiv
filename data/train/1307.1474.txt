    "high - mass stars play a key role in the evolution of the energetics and chemistry of molecular clouds and galaxies .",
    "however , our knowledge of their formation is still poor , compared with that of low - mass stars .",
    "there are several factors that make the study of high - mass star formation more challenging than that of their low - mass counterparts .",
    "high - mass stars are rare and evolve quickly .",
    "massive star - forming regions in the earliest stages of evolution are mostly located at large distances ( @xmath7 3 kpc ) and are heavily extincted by dust .",
    "the earliest well - understood phase of high - mass star formation are the hot molecular cores ( hmcs , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , at this stage , the high - mass stars have already begun burning hydrogen and reached the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , disturbing and changing the kinematics and chemistry of the initially starless cocoon .",
    "prestellar cores represent the earliest stage of star formation .",
    "these starless cores are formed by dense , centrally - concentrated parcels of gravitationally bound gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "prestellar cores will eventually collapse and evolve to form stars .",
    "the prestellar phase in high - mass star formation has been very difficult to find .",
    "initially , large infrared / millimeter surveys had poor angular resolution and sensitivity , producing a bias toward bright , evolved objects and a misidentification of starless candidates . however , with the advent of new space telescopes , such as _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ , and submillimeter galactic plane surveys , it has been possible to study in detail the best candidates for dense regions which will eventually form massive stars , the so - called infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) .",
    "irdcs appear as dark silhouettes against the galactic mid - infrared background .",
    "galactic plane surveys revealed thousands of irdcs ( _ iso _ , @xcite ; _ msx _ , @xcite , @xcite ; _ spitzer _ , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the first studies characterizing them suggested that they were cold ( @xmath825 k ) , massive ( @xmath010@xmath910@xmath10 ) , and dense ( @xmath710@xmath11 @xmath12 ) molecular clouds with high column densities ( @xmath010@xmath13 @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "more recent studies on irdc clumps0.11 pc and a mass @xmath010@xmath910@xmath15 .",
    "we use the term `` core '' to describe a compact , dense object within a clump with a size @xmath00.010.1 pc and a mass @xmath01 - 10@xmath9 . ]",
    "show that they have typical masses of @xmath0120 , sizes of @xmath00.5 pc @xcite , dust temperatures that range between 16 and 52 k , and luminosities that range from @xmath010 to 510@xmath16   @xcite .",
    "nh@xmath5 rotational temperatures are typically lower than dust temperatures and range from @xmath01020 k @xcite .",
    "evidence of active high - mass star formation in irdcs is inferred by the presence of ultracompact ( uc )  regions @xcite , hot cores @xcite , embedded 24 @xmath2 m sources @xcite , molecular outflows @xcite , or maser emission @xcite .",
    "irdcs also host massive , cold ir - dark clumps that show similar physical properties to those clumps that host active high - mass star formation , except that the temperature and luminosity are lower .",
    "these characteristics suggest that massive , cold ir - dark clumps will form high - mass stars in the future .",
    "these objects are the best candidates for the most elusive and earliest phase of high - mass star formation , the `` prestellar '' or `` starless '' phase .",
    "although several studies have focused on irdcs , the number of studies on starless candidates is small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite studied in detail an ir quiescent clump , apparently starless , resolving it into 5 cores at 1.3 mm with sma . however ,",
    "new sma observations at 0.88 mm obtained by @xcite show that all cores are associated with molecular outflows .",
    "this suggests that this clump is in fact forming stars which have entered the accretion phase .",
    "thus , it is crucial to evaluate the prestellar nature of a core / clump by using interferometric observations of molecular lines , and their starless nature should not be asserted just by the lack of a detection in the ir .",
    "little is known about the chemistry of irdcs .",
    "a few works have focused on molecular lines surveys of several irdcs @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite find chemical variations between different evolutionary stages using a set of 10 different molecular lines at 3.3 mm .",
    "however , most of the effort related to chemistry in irdcs has been focused on deuteration .",
    "recent findings suggest that the deuterium fraction in high - mass star - forming regions resembles that seen in low - mass star - forming regions after the stars turn on , decreasing with time as the clumps evolve to warmer temperatures @xcite .",
    "the internal kinematic structure of irdcs has not yet been explored in depth . in two examples , irdc g019.30 + 0.07 @xcite and irdc g035.39 - 00.33 @xcite ,",
    "both irdcs are composed of a few slightly different velocity components or `` subclouds '' .",
    "it is still unclear what role these subclouds play in the earliest stages of high - mass star formation .",

    "in addition , one of the possible explanations for the narrow sio component in the center - west part of the irdc is that the sio emission is produced for an unresolved population of low - mass stars .    on the other hand , the central clump mm1 is quiescent .",
    "it is cold ( 12 k ) and lacks ir sources , cm continuum and sio emission are not detected , molecular line widths are narrow ( @xmath232 ) , and the nh@xmath1d abundance is high .",
    "the combination of all these characteristics of mm1 indicates that this clump is still in a prestellar stage .",
    "although regions in the same irdc may show indirect signs of star formation , all the observations are consistent with the massive clump mm1 being a pristine starless clump . to determine whether mm1 will form stars in the future , we compare the dust mass ( @xmath103 ) with the virial mass ( @xmath104 ) . in section  [ dust_temp ]",
    "we estimated a @xmath103 of 1520 , using the 1.2 mm dust continuum emission . to determine the virial mass",
    ", we follow the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the virial mass of a clump with an uniform density profile , neglecting magnetic fields and external forces , is given by @xmath105 , where @xmath63 is the radius of the clump in pc and @xmath106 is the line width in . adopting the same size used to obtain @xmath103 , a radius of 0.6 pc , and an average line width for mm1 of 1.9  ( from table  [ tbl - gaussian ] ) , we obtain a virial mass of @xmath0450 .",
    "therefore , the virial parameter , @xmath107 , is 0.3 , indicating that the clump mm1 is gravitationally bound and eventually , due to its large mass , will form stars . to further investigate if the clump mm1 will form high - mass stars , we use the results from @xcite .",
    "they find an empirical massive star formation threshold , based on clouds with and without high - mass star formation .",
    "they suggest that irdcs with masses larger than the mass limit given by @xmath108 = 870  ( r / pc)@xmath109 are forming high - mass stars or will form in the future . applying this relationship to mm1 ,",
    "its corresponding mass limit is 440 .",
    "thus , `` the compactness '' ( @xmath103/@xmath108 ) of mm1 is 3.5 and it is highly likely that the clump will form high - mass stars in the future .    our observation that other regions in the irdc , but not mm1 , may be forming stars raises a number of questions",
    ". why would star formation not start first in mm1 ?",
    "if we observe at higher angular resolution and sensitivity , would we be able to resolve and associate cores or protostars with the sio emission ? how does the scenario observed in irdc g028.23 - 00.19 fit into current models of high - mass star formation ?",
    "such questions may be possibly answered with observations at higher angular resolution and better sensitivity .",
    "we have observed the irdc g028.23 - 00.19 in several molecular species ( nh@xmath1d , h@xmath6co@xmath18 , sio , hn@xmath6c , c@xmath1h , hco@xmath18 , hnc , n@xmath1h@xmath18 , and ch@xmath5oh ) and continuum emission at 3.3 mm using carma ( 11  angular resolution ) .",
    "this irdc is dark at _ spitzer _ 3.6 , 4.5 , 8.0 , and 24 @xmath2 m and _ herschel _ 70 @xmath2 m . in its center ,",
    "the irdc hosts one of the most massive ir , quiescent clumps known ( mm1 ) .",
    "we have examined the spectral line observations and draw the following conclusions :    \\1 . using the emission detected at 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath2 m with _ herschel _ , and the 1.2 mm emission from iram 30 m , we updated the mass ( 1520 ) and the dust temperature ( 12 k ) of the central clump in irdc g028.23 - 00.19 .",
    "the low temperature , high nh@xmath1d abundance , low hco@xmath18 and hnc abundances , non - detection of sio , narrow line widths , and absence of embedded ir sources in mm1 indicate that the clump still remains in a prestellar phase .",
    "strong sio components with broad line widths are detected in the northern and southern regions of the irdc .",
    "the large line widths ( 6 - 9 ) and high abundances ( 0.8 - 3.810@xmath3 ) of sio suggest that the mechanism releasing sio from the dust grains into the gas phase could be molecular outflows from undetected intermediate - mass stars or clusters of low - mass stars deeply embedded in the irdc .",
    "however , in the southern region where the sio abundance peaks , there is no associated counterpart in the continuum .",
    "a weaker sio component is detected in the center - west part of the irdc .",
    "the narrow line widths ( @xmath02 ) and low sio abundances ( 4.310@xmath4 ) are consistent with either a `` subcloud - subcloud '' interaction or an unresolved population of a few low - mass stars .",
    "higher angular resolution observations are needed to clearly establish the origin of the narrow sio emission .",
    "we report unexpected widespread ch@xmath5oh emission throughout the whole irdc and the first detection of extended methanol emission in a massive prestellar clump .",
    "because ir observations show no primary protostar embedded in the irdc , we reject thermal evaporation of methanol from dust mantles as the production mechanism .",
    "ch@xmath5oh emission with broad line widths support the idea of molecular outflows in the southern and northern regions of the irdc .",
    "the ch@xmath5oh emission at the position of mm1 is rather narrow .",
    "we suggest that the most likely mechanism able to release methanol from the dust grains to the gas phase in such a cold region is the exothermicity of surface reactions @xcite .",
    "c@xmath1h has been suggested to be a pdr tracer .",
    "however , recent evidence suggests it could also trace cold , dense gas associated with earlier stages of star formation .",
    "because the spatial distribution of c@xmath1h emission resembles that of nh@xmath1d , we suggest c@xmath1h traces cold , dense gas in this irdc .",
    "hn@xmath6c reveals that the irdc is composed of two substructures ( `` subclouds '' ) separated by 1.4 .",
    "remarkably , the subclouds overlap in the center - west region of the irdc , exactly coincident with the narrow sio component .",
    "one explanation for the narrow sio component is that both subclouds may be interacting and producing low velocity shocks that release small amounts of sio to the gas phase .",
    "we speculate that irdcs may be young molecular clouds that could still be in a stage where they are being assembled .",
    "\\8 . in the densest part of the irdc",
    ", the mm1 clump shows no signs of star formation .",
    "notably , in other regions of the irdc it appers that star formation activity may be occurring .",
    "why star formation would begin in less dense regions and how the findings on irdc g028.23 - 00.19 fit into current models of high - mass star formation are open questions that will be addressed in future investigations .",
