    "following his formulation of general relativity einstein @xcite boldly applied the theory to the universe as a whole .",
    "the first cosmological model was _",
    "static _ to match the known universe , which at that time was restricted to the milky way , and to achieve this einstein introduced the ` cosmological constant ' term ( for a historical perspective , see @xcite ) . within a decade",
    "however slipher and hubble demonstrated that the nebulae on the sky are in fact other ` island universes ' like the milky way and that they are mainly receeding from us  the universe is expanding .",
    "einstein wrote to weyl in 1933 : _",
    "`` if there is no quasi - static world , then away with the cosmological term''_.    this however is not a matter of choice since general coordinate invariance , which einstein s equation is based on , permits an arbitrary constant ( multiplied by the metric tensor ) to be added to the lhs : @xmath1 here we have written newton s constant , @xmath2 where @xmath3  gev is the ( reduced ) planck mass in natural units ( @xmath4 ) . with the subsequent development of quantum field theory it became clear that the energy - momentum tensor on the rhs can also be freely scaled by another additive constant multiplying the metric tensor , which reflects the ( lorentz invariant ) energy density of the vacuum : @xmath5 this contribution from the matter sector adds to the `` bare '' term from the background geometry , yielding an effective cosmological constant : @xmath6 or , correspondingly , an effective vacuum energy : @xmath7    einstein _ assumed _ without any observational evidence that the universe is perfectly homogeneous .",
    "we know that the universe is quite isotropic about us so this is in fact likely if we are not in a special location  an assumption later dignified by milne as the ` cosmological principle ' . then using the _ maximally symmetric _ robertson - walker metric to describe space - time @xmath8 , \\label{rw}\\ ] ] we obtain the friedmann equations describing the evolution of the cosmological scale - factor @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the 3-space curvature signature and for ordinary matter ( ` dust ' ) and radiation we have used the ` ideal gas ' form : @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "the conservation equation @xmath14 implies @xmath15 , so given the ` equation of state parameter ' @xmath16 , the evolution history can now be constructed . since the redshift is @xmath17 , for non - relativistic particles with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , while for relativistic particles with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , but for the cosmological constant , @xmath22 and @xmath23constant .",
    "thus radiation was dynamically important only in the early universe ( for @xmath24 ) and for most of the expansion history only non - relativistic matter is relevant . the hubble equation can be rewritten with reference to the present epoch ( subscript 0 ) as @xmath25 , \\\\",
    "\\omega_\\mathrm{m } & \\equiv & \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}0}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{c } } , \\quad \\omega_\\kappa \\equiv -\\frac{\\kappa}{a_0 ^ 2 h_0 ^ 2 } , \\quad \\omega_\\lambda \\equiv \\frac{\\lambda}{3 h_0 ^ 2 } , \\label{hub}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the ` critical density ' and the present hubble parameter is @xmath27 with @xmath28 , i.e. about @xmath29  gev .",
    "this yields the sum rule @xmath30 so cosmological models can be usefully displayed on a ` cosmic triangle ' @xcite .",
    "as emphasised in an influential review @xcite , given that the density parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 were observationally constrained already to be not much larger than unity , the two terms in eq.([tuning ] ) are required to somehow _ conspire _ to cancel each other in order to satisfy the approximate constraint @xmath33 thus bounding the present vacuum energy density by @xmath34 which is a factor of over @xmath35 below its `` natural '' value of @xmath36  the ` cosmological constant problem ' .",
    "subsequently , several types of evidence have been advanced to argue that this inequality is in fact saturated with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( see @xcite ) , i.e. there is non - zero vacuum energy of _ just the right order of magnitude so as to be detectable today_.    in the lagrangian of the standard @xmath41 model ( sm ) of electroweak and strong interactions , the term corresponding to the cosmological constant is one of the two ` super - renormalisable ' terms allowed by the gauge symmetries , the second one being the quadratic divergence in the mass of fundamental scalar fields due to radiative corrections ( see @xcite ) . to tame the latter sufficiently in order to explain the experimental success of the sm has required the introduction of a ` supersymmetry ' between bosonic and fermionic fields which is ` softly broken ' at about the fermi scale , @xmath42  gev thus the cutoff scale of the sm , viewed as an effective field theory , can be lowered from @xmath43 down to @xmath44 , at the expense of introducing over 100 new parameters in the lagrangian , as well as requiring delicate control of the non - renormalisable operators which can generate flavour - changing neutral currents , nucleon decay etc , so as not to violate experimental bounds .",
    "this implies a _ minimum _ contribution to the vacuum energy density from quantum fluctuations of @xmath45 , i.e. halfway on a logarithmic scale down from @xmath43 to the energy scale of @xmath46 corresponding to the observationally indicated vacuum energy .",
    "thus even the introduction of supersymmetry can not eradicate a discrepancy by a factor of at least @xmath47 between the natural expectation and observation .    it is likely that a satisfactory resolution of the cosmological constant problem can be achieved only in a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "recent developments in string theory and the possibility that there exist new dimensions in nature have generated many interesting ideas concerning possible values of @xmath48 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless it is the case that there is no accepted solution to the enormous discrepancy discussed above .",
    "the problem is not new but there has always been the hope that some day we would understand why @xmath48 is exactly zero , perhaps due to a new symmetry principle .",
    "however if it is in fact non - zero and dynamically important _ today _ , the crisis is even more severe since this also raises a cosmic ` coincidence ' problem , viz .",
    "why is the present epoch special ?   today , we can not have @xmath49 _ always _ since this would amount to a substantial renormalisation of @xmath43 in eq.([fried ] ) ( taking @xmath50 as suggested by inflation ) ; this is inconsistent with primordial nucleosynthesis which requires the `` cosmic '' newton s constant to be within a few % of its laboratory value @xcite .",
    "thus arguably the most natural solution to the ` coincidence problem ' is ruled out empirically .",
    "] it has been suggested that the ` dark energy ' may not be a cosmological _ constant _ but rather the slowly evolving potential energy @xmath51 of a hypothetical scalar field @xmath52 named ` quintessence ' which can _ track _ the matter energy density ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this however is equally fine - tuned since we need @xmath53  gev but @xmath54  gev ( in order that the evolution of @xmath52 be sufficiently slowed by the hubble expansion ) , and moreover does not address the fundamental issue , namely why are all the other possible contributions to the vacuum energy absent ? given the no - go theorem against any dynamical cancellation mechanism in eq.([tuning ] ) in the framework of general relativity @xcite , it might appear that solving the problem will necessarily require modification of our understanding of gravity .",
    "interesting suggestions have been made in this context e.g. the dgp model in which gravity alone propagates in a new dimension that opens up on distance scales of @xmath55 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however since this is an unnaturally large scale for a fundamental theory , this model is clearly just as fine tuned as the cosmological constant and moreover suffers from intrinsic theoretical difficulties such as violation of unitarity due to ` ghosts ' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is so desperate that ` anthropic ' arguments have been advanced to explain why the cosmological constant is of just the right order of magnitude to allow of our existence today  if it was much higher then galaxies would never have have formed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however a recent analysis @xcite shows that the most likely value from such bayesian arguments is in fact 2030 times bigger than the observationally suggested value .",
    "moreover , one can not claim to have a rigorous understanding of the prior probability distribution , lacking a theory of the cosmological constant itself .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the prior is flat in @xmath48 , but if it is instead flat in say @xmath56 , the most likely value of @xmath48 would be zero . a flat prior in @xmath48",
    "is indeed expected in quintessence - like models with a very flat potential @xcite , but such models are highly fine - tuned and have little physical basis . whereas an uniform distribution of @xmath48 does arise in the landscape of the large number ( @xmath57 ) of possible vacua in string theory ( see @xcite ) , there is no accepted measure for how these vacuua may come to be populated through cosmological evolution .",
    "given this situation , we can ask whether the observations really require dark energy or whether this is just an artifact of interpreting the data using an over - idealised description of the universe . for the frw model we see from eq.([fried ] ) that deducing @xmath48 to be of @xmath58 from observations should not be unexpected , this being its _ natural _ scale in such a model universe ( what seems quite unnatural is the _ implied _ fundamental energy scale of @xmath59 since @xmath60 is so much smaller than @xmath43 ) . from this perspective , it is easy to see why there have been recurring claims for @xmath61  this is effectively forced upon us by the theoretical framework in which the data is interpreted .",
    "a recurring argument for a cosmological constant has come from consideration of the age and present expansion rate of a frw cosmology . for a spatially flat universe",
    ", the present age is @xmath62 for @xmath63 and it has often been suggested that the observed age is too long to be consistent with the observed hubble parameter for such an universe which has always been decelerating . by contrast , an universe with @xmath64 , @xmath65 would be older with @xmath66 ( see @xcite ) , as is also the case for a ` milne universe ' which expands at a constant rate .",
    "advances in astronomical techniques now enable direct radioactive dating using stellar spectra , e.g. the detection of singly ionized @xmath67u in the extremely metal - poor star cs31802 - 001 in the galactic halo implies an age of @xmath68  gyr @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the ( 95% c.l . )",
    "range of @xmath69  gyr for the age of ( the oldest stars in ) globular clusters which is indirectly inferred from the observed hertzprung - russell diagram using stellar evolution modelling , after adding on @xmath70  gyr , the estimated epoch of star formation @xcite .    with regard to the present expansion rate , the _",
    "hubble key project _ @xcite has provided direct measurements of the distances to 18 nearby spiral galaxies ( using cepheid variables ) and these have been used to calibrate five secondary methods ( such as type  ia supernovae ) which probe to deeper distances and yield : @xmath71 this has come to be the generally accepted value e.g. by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "it has been argued however that the _ hkp _ data need to be corrected for local peculiar motions using a more sophisticated flow model than was actually used , and also for metallicity ( heavy element abundance ) effects on the cepheid calibration  this would lower @xmath60 to @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the cepheid calibration to metallicity is also emphasised in a reanalysis of the _ hkp _ data which finds larger distances to the 6 sne  ia - calibrating galaxies used by @xcite , thus obtaining @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "even smaller values of @xmath60 have been deduced using physical methods such as measurements of time delays in gravitationally lensed systems , which bypasses the traditional ` distance ladder ' calibration and probes to far deeper distances . using the well - measured time delays of ten multiply - imaged quasars and taking the lenses to be isothermal dark matter halos yields @xmath74 @xcite ; however the observations are consistent with the _ hkp _ value ( [ hkp ] ) if there are varying amounts of dark matter in the lensing galaxies , consistent with the mass profiles obtained for them from stellar population evolution models @xcite .",
    "measurements of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in 41 x - ray emitting galaxy clusters also indicated a low value of @xmath75 for a @xmath64 , @xmath65 universe , dropping further to @xmath76 for @xmath63 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , a recent analysis of 38 clusters finds higher values of , respectively , @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the two cases , with an estimated systematic uncertainty of about @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "as seen in figure  [ h0 ] , the systematic uncertainties presently preclude a definitive conclusion using either method .    even so this raises the question whether there may be spatial variations in the measured hubble rate , e.g. because we are inside an underdense region ( ` hubble bubble ' ) that is expanding faster than the average @xcite .",
    "such voids are seen in all surveys of large - scale structure ( see e.g. @xcite ) and there are persistent indications from galaxy counts that we may be located in such a region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent work using sne  ia detects a drop in the expansion rate of @xmath80 at a distance of 7400  km  s@xmath81 @xcite ) , although this is sensitive to the precise manner in which corrections are made for reddening due to dust @xcite .",
    "the measured cmb dipole ( due to our peculiar motion with respect to the cmb rest frame ) implies a general bound on the variance of such deviations , if the density fluctuations are gaussian , of @xmath82 in a sphere of radius @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "moreover the _ hkp _ data show statistically significant variations in @xmath60 of @xmath84 across the sky @xcite .",
    "the sne  ia dataset also shows a significant systematic difference in the expansion rate in the north and south galactic hemispheres @xcite .    to conclude , current estimates of the hubble constant",
    "are typically quoted with 10% uncertainty but range between 60 and @xmath85 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus the age argument can not be used to definitively exclude the einstein  de sitter ( e - des ) model and argue for a cosmological constant .",
    "more worryingly , there are indications for local imhomogeneity , as well as anisotropy in the hubble flow which can significantly bias cosmological inferences drawn assuming an exactly homogeneous frw model ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is essential that the fundamental assumption of homogeneity underlying the standard cosmology be rigorously tested , now that a wealth of data is available to carry out such tests .",
    "the most exciting observational development in studies of the hubble expansion rate have undoubtedly been in measurements of the deceleration parameter @xmath86 .",
    "this has been found to be _ negative _ through deep studies of the hubble diagram of sne  ia pioneered by the _",
    "supernova cosmology project _ @xcite and the _ high - z sn search team _ @xcite .",
    "their basic observation was that distant supernovae at @xmath87 are @xmath88 mag ( corresponding to @xmath89 ) fainter than would be expected for a decelerating universe such as the @xmath63 e - des model .",
    "this has been interpreted as implying that the expansion rate has been _ accelerating _ since then , consequently the observed sne  ia are actually further away than expected .",
    "the measured apparent magnitude @xmath90 of a source of known absolute magnitude @xmath91 yields the ` luminosity distance ' : @xmath92 which is sensitive to the expansion history , hence the cosmological parameters . according to the second friedmann equation ( [ fried ] ) an accelerating expansion rate requires the dominant component of the universe to have _ negative _ pressure .",
    "the more mundane alternative possibility , namely that the sne  ia appear fainter because of absorption by intervening dust , can be observationally constrained since this would also lead to characteristic reddening , unless the dust has unusual properties @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult to rule out that the dimming is due to evolution , i.e. that the distant sne  ia ( which exploded over 5 gyr ago ) are intrinsically fainter by @xmath93 ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "although sne  ia are believed to result from the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf , there is no `` standard model '' for the progenitor(s ) ( see @xcite ) , hence there may well be luminosity evolution which would complicate the use of sne  ia as ` standard candles ' .",
    "however it is known ( using nearby sne  ia with independently measured distances ) that their time evolution is tightly correlated with their peak luminosities such that the intrinsically brighter ones fade faster .",
    "this can be used to make corrections to reduce the scatter in the hubble diagram using various _",
    "empirical _ methods such as a ` stretch factor ' to normalise the observed apparent peak magnitudes @xcite or the ` multi - colour light curve shape ' method @xcite .",
    "such corrections are _ essential _ to reduce the scatter in the data sufficiently so as to allow meaningful deductions to be made about the cosmological model .",
    "it is a matter of concern that the corrections made by different methods do not always correlate with each other when applied to the same objects ( see @xcite ) , especially since there is no physical understanding of the observed correlations .",
    "figure  [ snhub ] shows an example magnitude - redshift diagram of sne  ia obtained by the _ supernova search team _ @xcite using a carefully compiled ` gold set ' of 142 sne  ia from ground - based surveys , together with 14 sne  ia in the range @xmath94 discovered with the _ hubble space telescope_. the latter are _",
    "brighter _ than would be expected if extinction by dust or simple luminosity evolution ( @xmath95 ) is responsible for the observed dimming of the sne  ia upto @xmath87 , and thus support the earlier indication of an accelerating cosmological expansion .",
    "however alternative explanations such as luminosity evolution proportional to _ lookback time _ , or extinction by dust which is maintained at a constant density are still viable .",
    "moreover for reasons to do with how sne  ia are detected , the dataset consists of approximately equal subsamples with redshifts above and below @xmath96 .",
    "it has been noted that this is also the redshift at which the acceleration is inferred to begin and that if these subsets are analysed _ separately _",
    ", then the 142 ground - observed sne  ia are consistent with deceleration ; only when the 14 high-@xmath97 sne  ia observed by the _",
    "are included is there a clear indication of acceleration @xcite .",
    "clearly further observations are necessary particularly at the rather poorly sampled intermediate redshifts @xmath98  precisely the redshift range where the dark energy is supposed to have come to dominate the expansion leading to acceleration .",
    "further observations have been made by the _ supernova legacy survey _ @xcite and _ essence _",
    "@xcite at the upper end of this redshift range , and these analyses have confirmed the previous indications of accelerated expansion .",
    "a very different picture emerges however when the consistency of different data sets is examined more closely @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the nearby ( @xmath99 ) sne  ia data indicates _ anisotropic _ expansion ( at @xmath100 c.l . ) , suggestive of an unidentified systematic error .",
    "while data from the north galactic hemisphere are consistent with accelerated expansion , data from the south galactic hemisphere are not conclusive in this regard .",
    "even when the full - sky data is used , figure  [ schwarz ] shows that @xmath101 is still permitted at @xmath102 , although @xmath103 ( the decelerating e - des model ) is rejected at this level .",
    "these authors conclude : _ `` our model independent test fails to detect acceleration of the universe at high statistical significance '' _ @xcite .",
    " the horizontal axis shows the derived hubble parameter relative to a fiducial value of @xmath104 .",
    "the value of @xmath105 deduced from _",
    "data is shown for comparison ( from @xcite).,scaledwidth=58.0% ]",
    "although the first indications for an accelerating universe from sne  ia were rather tentative , the notion that dark energy dominates the universe became widely accepted rather quickly ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this was because of two independent lines of evidence which also suggested that there is a substantial cosmological constant .",
    "the first was that contemporaneous measurements of degree - scale angular fluctuations in the cmb by the _ boomerang _ @xcite and _ maxima _ @xcite experiments provided a measurement of the sound horizon ( a ` standard ruler ' ) at recombination ( see @xcite and thereby indicated that the curvature term @xmath106 , i.e. the universe is spatially flat .",
    "the second was that , as had been recognised for some time , several types of ( mainly local ) observations indicate that the amount of matter which participates in gravitational clustering is much less than the critical density , @xmath39 ( see @xcite .",
    "the cosmic sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) then requires that there be some form of ` dark energy ' , unclustered on the largest spatial scales probed in the measurements of @xmath31 , with an energy density of @xmath107 .",
    "this was indeed consistent with the value of @xmath108 suggested by the sne  ia data @xcite leading to the widespread identification of the dark energy with a cosmological constant .",
    "in fact all data to date are consistent with @xmath22 and this ` concordance model ' is termed @xmath48cdm since the matter content must mostly be cold dark matter ( cdm ) given the constraint from primordial nucleosynthesis on the baryonic component @xmath109 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently a major advance has come about with precision measurements of the cmb anisotropy by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "@xcite , and of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering by the _ 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey _ @xcite and the _ sloan digital sky survey _ @xcite .",
    "the paradigm which these measurements test is that the early universe underwent a period of inflation which generated a gaussian random field of of small density fluctuations ( @xmath110 with a nearly scale - invariant ` harrison - zeldovich ' spectrum : @xmath111 ) , and that these grew by gravitational instability in the sea of ( dark ) matter to create the large - scale structure , as well as leaving a characteristic anisotropy imprint on the ` last scattering surface ' of the cmb .",
    "the latter is a snapshot of the oscillations in the coupled baryon and photon fluids as the plasma ( re)combines suddenly and the universe becomes transparent at @xmath112 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitudes and positions of the resulting ` acoustic peaks ' in the angular power spectrum of the cmb are sensitive to the cosmological parameters and it was recognised that precision measurements of cmb anisotropy can thus be used to determine these accurately ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however in practice there are many ` degeneracies ' in this exercise hence prior assumptions have to be made concerning some of the parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) . an useful analogy is to see the generation of cmb anisotropy and the formation of lss as a sort of cosmic scattering experiment , in which the primordial density perturbation is the `` beam '' , the universe itself is the `` detector '' and its matter content is the `` target '' .",
    "in contrast to the situation in the laboratory , neither the properties of the beam , nor the parameters of the target or even of the detector are known  only the actual `` interaction '' may be taken to be gravity . in practice",
    "therefore assumptions have to be made about the nature of the dark matter ( e.g. ` cold ' non - relativistic or ` hot ' relativistic ? ) and about the nature of the primordial perturbation ( e.g. adiabatic or isocurvature ? ) as well as its spectrum , together with further ` priors ' ( e.g. on the curvature parameter @xmath113 or the hubble constant @xmath114 ) before the cosmological density parameters can be inferred from the data .",
    "note in particular that @xmath48 is dynamically quite negligible at such large redshifts , so its only effect is to change the distance to the last scattering surface , hence the angular scale of the observed cmb anisotropies ( in particular the position of the first acoustic peak ) .    nevertheless as seen in figure  [ wmap ] , the angular spectrum of the cmb measured by _",
    "wmap _ is in impressive agreement with the expectation for a flat @xmath48cdm model , assuming a power - law spectrum for the primordial ( adiabatic ) perturbation @xcite .",
    "the fitted parameters for the 3-year data are @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 consistent with the _ hkp _ value ( [ hkp ] ) .",
    "the spectral index is obtained to be @xmath118 which is as expected in simple models of slow - roll inflation .",
    "it is particularly impressive that the prediction for the matter power spectrum ( obtained by convoluting the primordial perturbation with the cdm ` transfer function ' ) is in excellent agreement with the power spectrum of galaxy clustering measured by both _",
    "2dfgrs _ and _ sdss_. the power spectrum from spectral observations of the ` lyman-@xmath119 forest ' ( intergalactic gas clouds ) is also concordant ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "having established the consistency of the @xmath48cdm model , this is used to draw tight constraints e.g. on a ` hot dark matter ' ( hdm ) component which translates into a ( 95% c.l . ) bound on the summed neutrino masses of @xmath120 ev @xcite .    cdm model ( black line  3 year data , red line  1 year data ) ; the right panel shows the predicted matter power spectrum compared with the _ sdss _ data ( from @xcite).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0%]cdm model ( black line  3 year data , red line  1 year data ) ; the right panel shows the predicted matter power spectrum compared with the _ sdss _ data ( from @xcite).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=44.0% ]    it mut be pointed out however that cosmological models _ without _ any dark energy can fit exactly the same data by making different assumptions for the ` priors ' . for example , an e - des model is still allowed if the hubble parameter is as low as @xmath121 and the primordial spectrum is not scale - free but has a change in its slope at a wavenumber @xmath122 mpc@xmath81 @xcite .",
    "this is a toy model but an even better fit is obtained as shown in figure  [ wmap2 ] with a physically motivated ` bump ' in the range @xmath123 mpc@xmath81 @xcite .",
    "such a feature is plausible in ` multiple inflation ' based on supergravity @xcite wherein spontaneous symmetry breaking phase transitions occuring during inflation create sharp changes in the mass of the inflaton field . to satisfactorily fit the lss power spectrum",
    "also requires that the matter not be pure cdm but have a ` hot ' component , e.g. of neutrinos with ( approximately degenerate ) mass 0.5  ev ( i.e. @xmath124  ev ) which contribute @xmath125 .",
    "this had been noted independently for the _",
    "2dfgrs _ data @xcite and such a mass is within the sensitivity reach of the fortcoming katrin @xmath126-decay experiment @xcite . it is important to note that this ` cold + hot ' dark matter ( chdm ) model has @xmath127 , just as required by primordial nucleosynthesis , but because of the low hubble parameter the corresponding baryon density is about 10% .",
    "this is quite consistent with the observed baryon fraction in x - ray clusters , which is often used ( e.g. @xcite ) to deduce @xmath128 , hence the presence of dark energy , adopting the _ hkp _ prior on @xmath114 .",
    "moreover the value of @xmath129 , the variance of mass fluctuations on cluster scales , is about @xmath130 in this model , which is marginally consistent with measurements of cosmic shear due to weak gravitational lensing by large - scale structure ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however such a e - des cosmology fails to match the ` baryon acoustic oscillation ' ( bao ) peak observed in the galaxy autocorrelation function using luminous red galaxies at @xmath131 in _ sdss _ extending over a large survey volume .",
    "although the measured amplitude is below the expectation of the @xmath48cdm model , the position is just as expected in this model @xcite .",
    "the physical scale of the bao peak is independent of the cosmological model , but its observed position ( in redshift ) space ) is sensitive to the hubble parameter @xcite , hence the e - des cosmology with @xmath132 can not match the data as seen in figure  [ wmap2 ] .",
    "we now have a ` cosmic concordance ' model with @xmath133 which is supposedly consistent with all astronomical data but has no satisfactory explanation in terms of fundamental physics .",
    "one might hope to eventually find explanations for the dark matter ( and baryonic ) content of the universe in the context of physics beyond the standard model but there appears to be little prospect of doing so for the apparently dominant component of the universe  the dark energy which behaves as a cosmological constant .",
    "cosmology has in the past been a data - starved science so it has been appropriate to consider the simplest possible cosmological models in the framework of general relativity .",
    "however now that we are faced with this serious confrontation between fundamental physics and cosmology , it would seem prudent to reconsider the underlying assumptions , especially that of exact homogeneity .",
    "the observed isotropy of the cmb along with a belief in the cosmological principle has generally been taken to imply homogeneity but this has come to be questioned of late . there is growing interest in the inhomogeneous but isotropic lemaitre - tolman - bondi model of a local void ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a ltb model can in principle give an explanation of the oddities in the local hubble flow as well as account for the sne  ia hubble diagram without invoking acceleration ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recently it has been claimed @xcite that with a large local void of size @xmath134  mpc the angular diameter distance of the bao peak can also be matched in this model .",
    "such local inhomogeneity may be responsible for generating the mysteriously aligned low multipoles in the _ wmap _ sky @xcite .",
    "a void of this size does seem extremely unlikely , but one has recently been actually detected at @xmath135 and appears to be responsible for the anomalously ` cold spot ' seen by _ wmap _ @xcite .",
    "landau famously said _",
    "`` cosmologists are often wrong , but never in doubt''_. the situation today is perhaps better captured by pauli s enigmatic remark  the present interpretation of the data may be _ ``  not even wrong''_. however we are certainly not without doubt ! the crisis posed by the recent astronomical observations is not one that confronts cosmology alone ; it is the spectre that haunts any attempt to unite two of the most successful creations of 20th century physics  quantum field theory and general relativity .",
    "it would be fitting if the cosmological constant which einstein allegedly called his _",
    "`` biggest blunder '' _ proves to be the catalyst for triggering a new revolution in physics in this century .",
