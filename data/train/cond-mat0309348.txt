    "studies on spin glasses focus on systems with random frustrations @xcite .",
    "the energy landscape of a spin glass is very rough . when environmental temperature is lower than certain critical value , the system gets trapped in one of many local regions of the whole configurational space ( ergodicity breaking ) .",
    "the deep connection between frustrations in spin glasses and constraints in combinatorial optimization problems was noticed by many authors , and the replica method developed during the study of spin glass physics @xcite has been applied to hard combinatorial optimization problems including the k - satisfiability @xcite , the number partitioning @xcite , the euclidean matching @xcite , the vertex covering @xcite , and many others .",
    "however , sophistication of replica method renders analytical discussion to be limited usually to the replica - symmetric ( rs ) level .",
    "recently , considerable success has been attained in applying the cavity method @xcite to combinatorial optimization problems @xcite .",
    "the cavity formalism enables analytical calculations to be carried out to first - step replica - symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) . for random 3-satisfiability ( 3-sat )",
    "problems it was discovered @xcite that , between the easy - sat and unsat phase there is a hard - sat phase .",
    "the hard - sat phase is a glassy phase , with great many states of the same ground - state energy density which are separated by very high energy barriers .",
    "the easy - sat to hard - sat phase - transition is abrupt .",
    "similar behavior was observed in random 3-xor - sat @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "work performed on minimum vertex covering ( min - covering ) of random graphs @xcite suggested there is no proliferation of ground - states in this model system even when replica symmetry is broken .",
    "the following questions arise : ( 1 ) why in the rsb domain , the structural entropy density ( complexity ) of min - covering is zero ? ( 2 ) if there is a glassy phase - transition in a combinatorial optimization problem , is it always discontinuous ? in this article",
    ", we looked into these questions by studying the maximum matching ( max - matching ) problem of random graphs .",
    "we chose to work with max - matching because ( a ) as will be shown later , max - matching is equivalent to min - covering in the rs parameter range and , ( b ) there exist polynomial algorithms to find a max - matching , so that theory can be checked by experiment .",
    "we found that , when the average number of nearest - neighboring vertices of each vertex in a random graph , called the average vertex degree @xmath0 , is larger than @xmath1 the system is in a glassy phase with many max - matchings that have very large hamming distance between each other .",
    "contrast to the situations in random 3-sat and 3-xor - sat , these patterns appear gradually ; their number increases exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath2 , max - matching and min - covering are equivalent ( there is no edge - redundancy ) .",
    "when @xmath3 , the appearance of redundant edges , while adding great freedom to max - matching , cause severe constraints to min - covering patterns , since each edge needs to be covered in the later case .",
    "we also obtained an analytical expression for the average max - match size , which is in agreement with computer simulations in the whole range of parameter @xmath0 .",

    "there are @xmath5 vertices in the vertex set @xmath6 ; between any pair of vertices @xmath7 and @xmath8 , an edge is present in the edge set @xmath9 with probability @xmath10 and absent with probability @xmath11 .",
    "the average number of edges incident to a randomly chosen vertex is @xmath0 ; and for large graph size @xmath5 , the number @xmath12 of edges associated with a given vertex obeys the poisson distribution @xmath13 @xcite . a matching @xmath14 is a subset of the edge set @xmath9 such that no two edges in @xmath14 share a common vertex .",

    "what is the size @xmath16 of a max - matching for a random graph @xmath4 constructed by the above mentioned procedure ?",
    "this question could be answered analytically and algorithmically .",
    "first , we investigate random graph max - matching by zero - temperature statistical physics , and an analytical formula will be given .",
    "the max - matching patterns could be classified into different groups based on their mutual similarity .",
    "it turns out that the total number of such groups grow exponentially with graph size @xmath5 when the average vertex degree @xmath17 .",
    "we associate with each _ edge _ @xmath18 of graph @xmath4 a spin variable @xmath19 .",
