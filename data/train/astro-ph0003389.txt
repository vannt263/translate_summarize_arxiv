    "supersonic stellar winds shock the surrounding gas and drive expanding bubbles into the interstellar medium .",
    "these shocks provide an opportunity to probe the properties of both the driving stellar wind and the ambient medium .",
    "if the star is moving with respect to the interstellar gas , the bubble will be distorted into a cometary shape .",
    "when the stellar motion is supersonic , we refer to these as stellar wind bow shocks ( baranov , krasnobaev & kulikovskii 1971 ; dyson 1975 ) . since the discovery of such bow shocks around young b stars ( van buren & mccray 1988 ) , bow shocks have been found associated with many classes of objects , such as pulsars ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1992 ) and cataclysmic variables ( e.g. vela x-1 : kaper et al .",
    "1997 ) ; examples include well - known naked - eye stars ( e.g. betelgeuse : noriega - crespo et al .",
    "bow shocks have been proposed as an explanation for cometary , ultracompact hii regions ( van buren et al .",
    "1990 ; mac low et al .  1991 ) and as a means of explaining the lifetimes of ultracompact hii regions .",
    "in a recent survey of the iras database using hires processing , van buren , noriega - crespo , & dgani ( 1995 ) found 58 candidate bow shocks .",
    "non - axisymmetric stellar wind bow shocks occur when a star with an anisotropic wind moves supersonically with respect to the local medium , or if the star has an isotropic wind but moves in an ambient medium containing a transverse density gradient .",
    "models of non - axisymmetric bow shocks are relevant to cometary ultracompact hii regions due to wind - blowing o stars moving supersonically with respect to the surrounding molecular cloud , when the ambient material does not have a constant density .",
    "a non - axisymmetric bow shock has also been invoked to explain the morphology of kepler s supernova remnant , where the supernova ejecta collide with a non - axisymmetric bow shock generated by the pre - supernova wind ( bandiera 1987 ; borkowski , blondin & sarazin 1992 ) .",
    "another example is the bow shock due to the head of a jet propagating into a region with a density gradient .",
    "non - axisymmetric , ram - pressure balance models of the collision between a stellar wind and the photoevaporating flow from an externally illuminated circumstellar disk have been given by henney et al .",
    "a formulation for steady - state non - axisymmetric bow shocks and colliding winds was given by bandiera ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , bandiera s numerical method is sufficiently complicated that a simpler , analytic method is desirable .    in this contribution ,",
    "i present a method for solving the problem of steady - state , momentum - conserving , non - axisymmetric , thin - shell bow shocks and colliding winds .",
    "this is an extension of the previous analytic solution method of wilkin ( 1996 , hereafter paper i ) and of cant , raga , & wilkin ( 1996 , hereafter paper ii ) to non - axisymmetric problems ( see also wilkin 1997a ) .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in   2 , we formulate the problem of the steady - state collision of two winds , and in   3",
    "we treat the problem of a bow shock resulting from an isotropic wind interacting with a plane - parallel flow containing a transverse density gradient . in   4 , we allow for non - isotropic winds , especially an axisymmetric wind with random orientation of the symmetry axis with respect to the direction of stellar motion",
    ". the rate at which kinetic energy is thermalized for the bow shock is treated in   5 .",
    "results and future directions of this research are summarized in ",
    "the hypersonic collision of two winds will in general result in a system of two shocks . a specific example , that of a stellar wind bow shock , is shown schematically in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "because this paper is concerned with steady - state solutions , the colliding winds are assumed to be unchanging in time .",
    "the stellar wind bow shock arises when a wind - blowing star moves supersonically with respect to the intersellar gas . in this case",
    ", we formulate the problem in the reference frame of the star , so the ambient medium is described as a wind of parallel streamlines impinging on the bow shock . for the collision of two winds in a binary star , we will neglect orbital motion in order to consider a steady - state problem in an inertial reference frame . in steady - state ,",
    "the amount of mass and momentum within a given volume does not increase , and a flow pattern exists between the two shocks that carries away the mass and momentum deposited by the colliding winds . if the shocks are radiative , post - shock cooling lowers the temperature of the gas and leads to a large compression .",
    "we make the strong thin - shell assumption that cooling is so efficient that the shocked shell collapses to an infinitesimally thin layer , with a finite surface density @xmath0 of matter . for this thin - shell assumption to apply , it is also necessary that the post - shock gas not be supported by magnetic fields , which , if well - coupled to the gas , could maintain a finite thickness even in the presence of efficient cooling .",
    "we assume there are no other forces such as those due to radiation or magnetic fields .",
    "the two shocked winds may in principle be separated by a contact discontinuity",
    ". however , there would then be supersonic shear across the interface that is expected to be unstable , leading to a mixing of the two fluids .",
    "a detailed treatment of the mixing is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "instead , the mixing is assumed to be instantaneous , so the shell will have a unique velocity @xmath1 at any location within it .",
    "this velocity represents an average of the turbulent fluctuations that would be present in a more detailed treatment . in steady - state ,",
    "the geometric shape of the shell is unchanging in time , so the velocity of matter within the infinitely thin layer must be purely tangent to the shell .",
    "there will , however , be acceleration normal to the shell , because the fluid typically does not follow a straight path .",
    "the assumption that the incident streams are hypersonic , combined with the perfect cooling assumption , means that the flow within the shell will also be hypersonic , and pressure forces may be neglected in describing the motions along the shell . defining a spherical coordinate system @xmath2 , and denoting the radius of the surface by @xmath3 , a complete description of this idealized shell is given by specifying the quantities @xmath4 as a function of position @xmath5 within the shell .",
    "there are in fact only four independent quantities , because the condition that the motion within the shell be tangential implies that one need only solve for two velocity components .",
    "the conservation laws of mass and momentum may be used to derive the properties of the shell in terms of those of the two incident winds .",
    "since the momentum conservation law has three components , there will be four equations in four unknowns , or including the condition of zero normal velocity , five equations in five unknowns .",
    "because the assumption of vanishing thickness eliminates one spatial variable , these equations will be partial differential equations ( pdes ) in two spatial coordinates .",
    "suitable boundary conditions must also be specified . in practice , this means identifying the stagnation ( or standoff ) point , where the two winds collide head - on , and where for steady - state , the ram pressures of the two fluids balance .",
    "the equations may then be integrated away from the standoff point , following the motion of a fluid element . in order to begin the numerical integrations",
    ", one generally finds that an expansion about the conditions at the stagnation point is needed .",
    "this approach was taken by bandiera ( 1993 ) , who derived a set of pdes in curvilinear coordinates matched to the shape of the shell .",
    "these equations were then solved under the assumption of radial , constant velocity , isotropic winds from two point sources .",
    "the moving stellar wind bow shock problem is formally obtained by taking the limit of one source placed infinitely far away , while allowing its mass loss rate to be infinite so as to produce a finite density near the other star ( at the bow shock ) .",
    "bandiera noted that for the specific problems cited , the motion within the shell would be along planes .",
    "one may readily see this for the bow shock shown in figure  1 .",
    "consider a point on the bow shock surface , and the plane of constant azimuthal angle containing it and the stellar trajectory .",
    "the radial wind striking the shell at this point has momentum lying in this plane .",
    "similarly , the ambient medium striking this point has momentum lying in the plane .",
    "if the two incident streams mix instantaneously on impact , the resultant momentum must also lie in the same plane .",
    "as the fluid flows along the shell , it continues to incorporate momentum contributions lying in the same plane .",
    "the collision of radial winds emanating from two point sources gives the same result .",
    "thus , given the perfect mixing asumption , the flow within the shell will lie along planes , a situation we refer to as _",
    "meridional flow_. if the shocked fluid does not mix , the fluid trajectories in the shell are not confined to a plane , and further work is needed to solve this more complicated problem .",
    "the ensuing geometric simplification allowed bandiera to construct a two - dimensional grid , consisting of neighboring trajectories within the shell at a set of azimuthal angles .",
    "his computational method was to integrate the pdes for mass , normal momentum , and tangential momentum , by marching along the trajectories within the shell as if the equations were odes . by differencing neighboring solutions ,",
    "numerical values of the cross - streamline derivatives were obtained and supplied to the ode integrator . provided the spacing of the two - dimensional grid is sufficiently fine , his method will yield accurate solutions .",
    "bandiera postulated that the dependence of the equations on derivatives of quantities across streamlines was `` fictitious , '' although he did not succeed in eliminating it from the equations .    in this contribution , the solution method will be simplified to an integral approach that avoids the need for pdes , solving purely algebraic equations .",
    "additionally , the solution may conveniently be obtained in terms of ordinary cartesian , cylindrical polar , or spherical polar coordinates , and does not require a coordinate system matching the shape of the shell .",
    "the solution method is based upon the observation that thin shells driven by hypersonic winds are momentum - conserving in the vector sense ( paper i ) . in order to conserve momentum in steady - state",
    ", the momentum flux in the shell must be the _ vector sum _ of the two incident momentum fluxes , integrated from the standoff point to the point of interest .",
    "such an integration is performed over the area of the shell between two planes of constant azimuthal angle @xmath6 , in the limit that their separation @xmath7 is infinitesimal ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "for axisymmetric flow with no rotational motion about the symmetry axis , no mass or momentum crosses these bounding planes , so the mass and momentum flowing within such a wedge must exactly equal the sum of the mass or momentum fluxes onto the external faces of the bounding surfaces ( shocks ) .",
    "given the known vector momentum flux , one may determine the shape of the shell , since the fluid must move in the direction of its momentum . while this description is complete , the mathematics was subsequently simplified with the inclusion of an additional , angular momentum flux integral ( paper ii ) . in papers",
    "i and ii , only constant velocity , isotropic winds were considered . for such winds ,",
    "the vector momentum flux incident onto the shocked shell is independent of the detailed shape of the shell , so it is possible to specify the flux of momentum onto the shell from each side analytically .",
    "the methods of papers i and ii will now be extended to non - axisymmetric bow shocks and colliding winds , provided the flow is meridional . for meridional flow ,",
    "the bounding surfaces are again planes of constant @xmath6 , allowing us to integrate the external fluxes and determine the internal fluxes within the shell . for anisotropic ,",
    "radial , constant velocity winds , such as those considered by bandiera , the momentum flux will depend only upon the number of streamlines intersected , and we will be able to obtain solutions analytically .    proceeding with the solution method ,",
    "we note the location of the stagnation point , where the two streams collide head - on .",
    "for the two - wind collision , this point lies between the two stars , along the line connecting their centers . for the bow shock due to a wind - blowing star moving with respect to the ambient medium",
    ", it will lie on the stellar trajectory , in the direction of stellar motion .",
    "for either problem , the z - coordinate axis is chosen to contain the stagnation point at @xmath8 , with the coordinate origin at the wind source ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "in what follows , the wind from the coordinate origin will be referred to as `` the wind '' , while the `` second wind '' may be either a radial wind from a second point source , or the ambient medium in the frame of the moving star , where the ambient velocity is @xmath9 .",
    "however , we will show explicit formulas only for the bow shock , reserving detailed treatment of the binary star colliding winds for a future paper .",
    "one should bear in mind that the methods shown below will be applicable as well for that problem .",
    "returning to the description of a thin slice of the shell bounded by planes of constant @xmath6 , the mass , momentum , and angular momentum flux functions per unit azimuthal angle are defined by @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the cylindrical radius , and the unit vector at constant @xmath6 tangent to the shell is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the unit outward normal to the shell . noting that the arc length element @xmath16 traced along the shell is given by @xmath17 the arc length element traced along the shell at constant @xmath18 is @xmath19 , where the angle @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 for example , the flux of mass crossing a surface of constant polar angle @xmath18 , between the azimuthal angles @xmath6 and @xmath22 , is @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath24 is the @xmath18-component of velocity within the shell , and we write the cylindrical components of the momentum flux function as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then these components are related to the angular momentum flux by @xmath27 @xmath28 for meridional flow , the angular momentum within the shell will be in the @xmath29-direction , so for the remainder of the discussion we will only need the magnitude of the angular momentum flux @xmath30 .",
    "the mass , momentum , and angular momentum flux functions due to the incident winds are similarly defined .",
    "for the first wind , located at the coordinate origin , these are given in terms of the wind density @xmath31 and velocity @xmath32 as @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 the area of integration is that between two planes of constant @xmath6 , from the standoff point to polar angle @xmath18 , following the shape of the collision surface , which is determined along the course of the integrations .",
    "the sign of the normal direction is chosen so as to point away from the origin .",
    "the flux functions for the ambient medium are strictly analogous , except the unit vector normal to the collision surface would be in the reverse direction : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 if @xmath39 is the radius of the shell , and its partial derivatives are @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the surface area element is @xmath42 the unit outward normal @xmath15 to the surface is given by @xmath43 combining these , @xmath44 for a radial wind , the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath6 do not enter the expression for @xmath45 , which is simply @xmath46 similarly , for the ambient medium @xmath47 , so noting that @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 this eliminates some of the partial derivatives that complicated bandiera s very general treatment of the geometry",
    ". the rate at which conserved quantities are advected onto the shell does not depend upon the detailed description of the shell , provided we ensure the correct number of streamlines is counted . using eq.(16 ) , the resulting forms of eqs.(7 - 9 ) for the radial stellar wind are @xmath50 @xmath51 \\ ,   \\sin\\theta ' \\ , d\\theta',\\eqno(19)\\ ] ] @xmath52 here the radial unit vector has been written in terms of its cylindrical polar components , and the integrations are performed at constant @xmath6 .",
    "because the stellar wind is radial , it imparts no angular momentum to the shell , and the wind angular momentum flux vanishes . using eq.(17 ) to simplify eqs.(10 - 12 ) for the ambient medium , @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55    the mass conservation law for the pre - shock radial wind in steady - state is @xmath56 consequently ,",

    "note that eq.(26 ) assumes the stellar wind to be coasting .",
    "given this assumption , @xmath62 is independent of the radius .",

    "the final forms of the ambient flux functions are thus @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 the mass , momentum , and angular momentum flux functions for both the wind and ambient medium are clearly streamline integrals that do not depend upon the detailed shape of the shell - the integration is essentially one over the solid angle of the @xmath7 wedge , as seen by the origin .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the pre - shock media conserve these quantities in steady - state .",
    "suppose we have performed the integrations for the mass , momentum , and angular momentum onto the narrow slice of the shell , for both incident winds , according to eqs.(20,27,28,30 - 32 ) .",
    "in steady - state , these quantities do not accumulate at any location within the shell , but are carried away by the flow within the layer .",
    "the conservation laws of mass , momentum , and angular momentum take the form @xmath73",
    "@xmath74 @xmath75 now we may describe the properties of the shell explicitly in terms of those of the external winds .",
    "equation ( 6 ) yields the shell radius @xmath76 this equation combines the formulation of paper ii , which was in terms of azimuthally integrated fluxes , with the original treatment of paper i , using fluxes in an infinitesimally thin wedge . in eq.(36 ) , each momentum flux function within the shell is to be evaluated as the sum of appropriate source terms , using the conservation laws ( eqs.[34,35 ] ) .",
    "it is to be stressed that if the flow is not meridional , eq.(5 ) does not hold , and the solution method is considerably more complicated .",
    "however , eqs.(6,36 ) are still valid provided the angular momentum flux is replaced by its @xmath29 component . from eqs.(1,2 ) , the tangential velocity of matter in the shell is @xmath77 while the mass surface density in the shell is given by @xmath78      to provide a specific example of the solution method , as well as a reference solution to be compared to in the following , we consider the simple problem of a bow shock from an isotropic wind in a uniform ambient medium of density @xmath79 . in this case , @xmath80 , and the flux functions are @xmath81 @xmath82,\\eqno(40)\\ ] ] @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 because the stellar wind has uniform speed , we have replaced @xmath58 with @xmath87 .",
    "one could immediately substitute these results into eq.(36 ) to determine the shell s shape .",
    "however , before proceeding to apply the formalism , note that the equation for the shape of the shell depends upon a specific combination of three flux functions in eq.(36 ) .",
    "one may divide the equation into two parts , one part for each wind , according to @xmath88   - \\phi_{{\\rm j},k},\\eqno(44)\\ ] ] and @xmath89 or @xmath90 for the wind and ambient ( or second wind ) sources .",
    "physically , @xmath91 represents the applied torque necessary to compress the fan of streamlines between the stagnation point and position @xmath39 into a unidirectional beam possessing the same momentum flux ( we shall call @xmath91 the _ required torque _ ) .",
    "this is clearly seen by considering the radial wind from the coordinate origin .",
    "it has no angular momentum , but an equivalent beam containing the same momentum flux , located at a specific point @xmath39 does indeed have angular momentum about the origin , because the beam will not be radial . the required torque for the isotropic wind follows from eqs .  ( 20,40,44 ) : @xmath92 using eqs.(41 - 44 ) , the torque necessary to compress the ambient streamlines to a unidirectional beam is @xmath93 for the ambient medium , the required torque expression simplifies because the ambient medium has no cylindrical radial momentum , and its z - momentum flux is related to its mass flux by eq.(31 ) , so in general , @xmath94 similarly , the radial wind s required torque is simplified due to its lack of angular momentum about the origin .",
    "the solution surface is now defined by @xmath95 the interpretation of eq.(48 ) is that each wind supplies the torque necessary to compress the other wind .",
    "these torques are equal and opposite only if the correct value of the radius ( or cylindrical radius @xmath96 ) is used , conserving angular momentum as well as linear momentum .",
    "the utility of this approach is that if we vary the properties of one of the winds , holding the other constant , the shape of the shell is affected only by the change in the applied torque from the second wind .    now",
    "the applied torque expressions for the wind ( eq.[45 ] ) and the ambient medium ( eq.[46 ] ) , when substituted into eq.(48 ) , quickly recover the solution of paper i , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the standoff radius : @xmath99",
    "in this section we assume the asymmetry of the bow shock to be due to a density gradient in the ambient medium , while the the stellar wind is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "the next section will treat bow shocks from anisotropic winds .",
    "the mass and momentum contributions of the stellar wind to the shell are given by eqs.(39,40,20 ) , and its required torque is given by eq.(45 ) .",

    "these bow shock solutions differ from the standard model ( baranov , krasnobaev & kulikovskii 1971 ) in that the exponential ambient density distribution implies a finite total mass on one side of the bow shock .",
    "the solution then more closely resembles those of two - wind collisions ( paper ii ) where there is a finite opening angle for the bow shock tail .",

    "the energy thermalization rate of axisymmetric bow shocks and colliding winds has been considered by wilkin , cant & raga ( 2000 ) .",
    "the thermalization occurs in the shocks , post - shock ( radiative ) relaxation , and mixing .",

    "the rate of energy thermalization is precisely the same as for a uniform medium ( wilkin , cant , & raga 1997 ) , since it is the kinetic energy in the ambient frame that is thermalized : @xmath248 this rate of energy thermalization is appropriate for an arbitrary ambient distribution of matter , provided only that it is truly infinite in mass , and that the bow shock is steady - state in the star s frame .",
    "the second requirement demands that the ambient mass distribution be independent of the z - coordinate , although its @xmath249 distribution is arbitrary .",
    "an exception , for example , is the case of an exponential stratification , for which case the total ambient mass flux may be finite ( on one side of the bow shock ) . for this case , the center of mass frame is not equal to the ambient frame , and it is important to separately define the center of mass frame for each @xmath6 slice , as it will depend upon azimuthal angle for the portion of the bow shock that contains finite opening angle . because of the resulting opening angle , not all of the stellar wind kinetic energy ( in the ambient frame ) will be thermalized , for two reasons :",
    "( 1 ) some streamlines miss the shell , and ( 2 ) there is a net flow of momentum along the shell even at infinite distance , whereas for the standard bow shock @xmath250 in the ambient frame , far in the bow shock tail .",
    "we now consider the case of an anisotropic wind , to determine whether the energy thermalization rate depends on the orientation of the wind .",
    "however , the thermalization rate remains independent of the stratification of the ambient medium , subject to the caveat about finite - mass systems .",
    "for the remainder of this section , we allow the wind to be non - axisymmetric , so in equations ( 75,76 ) we use @xmath251 .",
    "when we refer to an axisymmetric wind , its axis of symmetry will be @xmath252 as before .",
    "the total kinetic energy loss rate of the wind is @xmath253 the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 are assumed to have unit average over @xmath63 steradians . in terms of this energy loss rate , we define the mean square wind speed as @xmath254 we also define a _ total _ vector momentum flux for the wind , a quantity that is non - vanishing only if the wind is not point - symmetric with respect to the origin @xmath255",
    "@xmath256    we now wish to calculate the kinetic energy deposition rate to the shell in the ambient frame .",

    "the second term is @xmath262 times the @xmath263 component of the wind momentum flux . in terms of the total wind kinetic energy flux and momentum flux",
    ", we have @xmath264    we see that a sufficient condition for the total thermalization rate to be independent of the wind orientation is the vanishing of @xmath265 .",
    "because we do not wish to invoke a special alignment of the wind orientation with the star s direction of motion , more typically this requires a point - symmetric wind such that @xmath266 . as a special case ,",
    "this can be more explicitly confirmed for the axisymmetric wind , assuming it is symmetric with respect to its midplane @xmath267 .",
    "because we are considering the total thermalization rate , we may perform the solid angle integration in starred coordinates . in this case , we need only the transformation equation for @xmath268 which is given by eq.(74 ) .",
    "we assume the wind to be axisymmetric and symmetric with respect to @xmath269 , so it has an expansion in @xmath171 with only even powers .",
    "this implies that the @xmath270 term in the integral will give no contribution , by parity , because it yields only a @xmath271 term , which vanishes in the azimuthal integration and terms with odd powers of @xmath171 , which vanish in the polar angle integration .",
    "the remaining contribution is then @xmath272 \\ , \\sin\\theta_*\\ , d\\theta_*,\\eqno(127)\\ ] ] @xmath273",
    "the total energy thermalization rate is independent of the orientation of the midplane - symmetric , axisymmetric wind .",
    "for the case of a non - point - symmetric wind , including an axisymmetric wind that does nt possess mirror symmetry with respect to the equator , the total thermalization rate will depend upon the stellar orientation because of the contribution from the @xmath274 term .",
    "this is the case of the example solution given in section  4.3 , for the wind with quadratic dependence on @xmath171 . for that wind , the total vector momentum loss rate is @xmath275 where @xmath276 points in the direction of the wind symmetry axis @xmath155 .",
    "the thermalization rate for the bow shock driven by this wind therefor has a fluctuation depending on orientation of the wind symmetry axis with respect to the stellar velocity of magnitude @xmath277 if the quadratic term in the wind momentum vanishes ( @xmath278 ) , then the absolute value of @xmath279 may not exceed unity .",
    "the amount this changes the total thermalization rate then depends upon the parameter @xmath280 .",
    "we must note that changing orientation of the point - symmetric wind did not change the total thermalization rate , but the spectrum of shock emission will clearly be different . for example the peak post - shock temperature will depend upon the incident normal component of velocity .",
    "the sum of thermalization by shock , relaxation , and mixing is independent of orientation , but the individual contributions will vary .",
    "this highlights the fact that the properties of bow shocks due to non - axisymmetric winds may be determined by measuring the bow shock shape , mass surface density ( or column density ) , kinematics , and radiated energy .",
    "although detailed shock calculations are beyond the scope of this work , a substantial amount of information should be obtainable from these global quantities and may be sufficient for sources where the data are sparse .",
    "i have shown how to solve the problem of non - axisymmetric bow shocks and wind collisions with a simple formalism that requires only algebraic equations .",
    "most often one considers constant wind speed for such problems , and in this case the method leads to exact , analytic ( although possibly implicit ) solutions .",
    "the availablility of simple analytic solutions makes it much easier to model observed sources and derive the properties of the driving winds . among the principal applications of these solutions",
    "would be to determine the cause of the asymmetry in observed bow shocks , whether it be due to the ambient medium or an anisotropic wind , or both .",
    "future improvements are needed to include non - radial and accelerating winds and shearing motions in the shell , in which case the fluid elements are not restricted to a plane .",
    "also , non - axisymmetric bow shocks due to colliding winds in binary systems , including the orbital motion , require a formulation in a non - inertial frame .",
    "a forthcoming paper will describe how to solve the general problem of colliding winds from two stars , including both anisotropy and acceleration in the winds .",
