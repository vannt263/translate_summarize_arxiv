    "a huge surge of interest for both graphene ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , and three dimensional topological insulators ( tis ) with two - dimensional topologically protected surface ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , has been stimulated by many unusual and sometimes counterintuitive properties of these materials .",
    "indeed , in both graphene and the surface states of tis , the effective hamiltonians describing an evolution of wave functions of electron elementary excitations are linear in the momentum , resulting in pseudo - relativistic phenomena ( e.g. , the klein tunnelling @xcite , the unconventional hall effect @xcite or the nonlinear magnetization @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to true relativistic particles which are difficult to manipulate , pseudo - relativistic dirac fermions e.g. in graphene , can be controlled by static periodic electric and/or magnetic fields , known as graphene superlattices ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such nano - structures can be experimentally implemented to control both spectrum and transport properties of dirac electrons in graphene .",
    "similar kind of structures have been proposed and made in tis @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can control the electron band structure and electron current both in graphene and in a topological insulator by applying a time - dependent laser field ( see , e.g. , @xcite for graphene ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a monochromatic laser field splits dirac cone energy spectrum into mini - zones which can either touch each other in several dirac points or be separated by gaps depending on electromagnetic field polarization .",
    "analogous techniques can be applied for tis .",
    "the fact that laser controlled graphene / tis electron band manipulation is quite promising for applications @xcite as well as the search for new physics , created much recent activity @xcite , while very recently the floquet - bloch states were observed on the surface of a ti @xcite and a photonic floquet crystal has been also proposed @xcite .",
    "even more intriguing dirac fermion dynamics can occur when a laser field is applied to graphene / ti superlattices resulting in acquiring an effective mass by the fermions @xcite .",
    "this situation has not been well studied yet due to a complex space - time dynamics described by the partial differential equation which can not be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations as for the case when either only laser field or only 1d periodic potential is applied .",
    "recently , a new method for dealing with such a situation has been proposed @xcite and giant backscattering resonances for electrons with small incident angles with respect to a 1d potential barrier has been predicted .",
    "this makes any further research in the field of laser - driven graphene / ti superlattices very timely .    in the present study ,",
    "we first show that the hamiltonian for a ti in external electromagnetic fields can be transformed to the dirac graphene hamiltonian by multiplying the second component of the corresponding spinor by an imaginary unity @xmath2 , if the component of the vector potential in the perpendicular direction @xmath3 is zero .",
    "this makes both problems for graphene and tis in electromagnetic fields mathematically equivalent and allows to unify all the developed techniques for the manipulation of electrons in both materials .",
    "then we focus on new unexplored phenomena , studying the manipulation of the dirac energy cone by varying the characteristics of the field of two linearly polarized monochromatic lasers , one with frequency @xmath0 and the other with double frequency ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) .",
    "we demonstrate , using the first order resonance approximation ( fora ) , that the dirac point of the original energy cone can be split into several dirac points whose location in momentum space and even their number can be readily controlled by the angle between the two oscillating fields as well as the amplitudes and time - phase shift of the electric fields of two lasers .",
    "moreover , our approach allows to estimate the time evolution of a wave function of dirac fermions , and , thus , calculate the fermion current at each state with certain momentum ( or wave number @xmath4 ) .",
    "this resulting current is similar for both graphene and tis and can be controlled by the time phase shift or the relative angle of two laser fields , allowing even to generate a dc current in a desirable direction due to the effect of harmonic mixing .",
    "we also consider a graphene / ti superlattice driven by a monochromatic ( one - frequency ) laser field and show that the number and location of the dirac points can be controlled by the relative angle between the laser and the static electric fields as well as their spatial and time periods of oscillations .",
    "finally , we go beyond the first order resonance approximation , for a simple case , to illustrate the validity of this approximation in the conclusions we arrive at .",
    "in the low - energy limit , the behavior of the charge carriers in electric field in graphene is described @xcite by the standard two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac equation where we set the electron charge @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 with the two - component wave function @xmath7 for electrons in the two triangular sublattices , @xmath8 is the momentum operator , @xmath9 is the vector potential and the vector @xmath10 represents the pauli matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( hereafter , we set @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermi velocity ) . for the case of a topological insulator , the equation for evolution of a wave function",
    "@xmath15 is the same if we replace the operator @xmath16 by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a unit vector pointed perpendicular to the 2d plane .",
    "however , both equations for the dirac - like fermions in both graphene and a tis coincide , if we use the following substitution @xmath19 in the equation for tis .",
    "similar analysis shows that fermion currents for graphene and tis completely coincide if these are calculated for the corresponding states ( e.g. states with a certain momentum ) .",
    "the reason is that one simply rotates the electron spin by multiplying the bottom component of a spinor by @xmath2 , but this procedure does not affect the charge degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the calculations of the spectrum and single - particle currents described below are applicable for both tis and graphene . in the following , we focus on the eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) only .    as a driving field @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we consider the superposition of two linear polarized electric fields having frequency @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; namely : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is oriented along the @xmath23 axis , without loss of generality .",
    "the angle @xmath24 is the one between the two oscillating fields with amplitudes proportional to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while @xmath27 is a phase shift of the two ac drives at time @xmath28 .",
    "such a driving field can be generated by two monochromatic lasers with a wave length much longer than the graphene ( or ti ) sample size projection on the we ve propagation direction ( in worst scenario the sample size should be smaller than laser wave length if wave propagates along the sample plane or just the sample thickness ( several atomic layers ) if the laser field propagates accross the sample ) .",
    "the time evolution of a wave function with a certain momentum @xmath4 can be described by @xmath29 and the dirac equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be reduced to a set of two ordinary differential equations for the two components @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the spinor @xmath32 .",
    "since the coefficients of the ordinary differential equations are periodic functions in time due to periodicity of @xmath9 , we can use the floquet theory searching for a solution in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the periodic function , which can be expanded in fourier series , and @xmath35 is the quasi - energy . in the resonance approximation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) we keep only the first lowest harmonics in the fourier expansion which are directly linked by the bi - frequency laser field . substituting the following expression @xmath36 , \\label{bi - firstorder}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] into eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and equating the amplitudes that multiply @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 separately while ignoring higher harmonics , we arrive at a simple linear matrix equation @xmath41 with @xmath42 a matrix that has constant elements and @xmath43 consisting of the time - independent amplitudes in fourier series .",
    "this eigenvalue - eigenvector problem can be solved numerically for each set of @xmath44 and @xmath45 allowing to construct both the electron pseudo - spectrum @xmath46 ( see fig.1 for the two lowest energy zones ) and an approximate wave function @xmath29 for the dirac fermions driven by the laser fields ( eq.[bi - field ] ) .",
    "moreover , the calculated approximate wave functions can be used to estimate the dirac fermion one - particle currents ( fig .",
    "2 ) at states corresponding to different values of momentum .    numerically",
    ", the calculated spectrum contains the first eight sub - bands . in order to consider the other sub - bands corresponding to higher energies ,",
    "the use of a higher order resonance approximation is needed , keeping higher order harmonics in the @xmath47-expansion . in this section",
    "we focus on the first two sub - bands touching each other in several dirac points .",
    "one main result is that the number and location ( in momentum space ) of these points are controlled by the bi - harmonic laser field and can be manipulated by any one of three methods , by changing : ( i ) the relative orientation @xmath24 of the electric fields of the first and second laser harmonics , ( ii ) the relative time shift @xmath27 of these drives , ( iii ) the drive amplitudes @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these dirac points originate from the splitting of the initial dirac point connecting the positive energy dirac cone with the negative energy dirac cone , if the laser field is switched off .     when applying two - frequency laser field ( [ bi - field ] ) with amplitudes @xmath48 , time phase shift @xmath49 , and relative angle @xmath50 .",

    "when both electrostatic and laser fields are directed along the same ( @xmath108 ) axis , the higher harmonics influence the spectrum strongly : in addition to a simple shift of the two very - low momentum dirac point , we observe splitting of the two higher momentum dirac points ( obtained in the first order approximation ) into four dirac points ( in the second approximation ) .",
    "note that the split dirac points are located at momentum just slightly below @xmath187 , where we can expect the stronger influence of higher harmonics .",
    "to conclude , in the present study we consider the quasi - energy spectra for both graphene and topological insulators and demonstrate that an application of the biharmonic laser field can provide a very useful method to manipulate the number and position of dirac points in the spectrum where the two lowest energy zones merge .",
    "there are , certainly , many other ways to manipulates the number and position of the dirac points in both classes of materials .",
    "the reason we make this specific proposal is that it is easy to be implemented experimentally and there is a good control , within the calculational scheme we use , of the results .",
    "it is evident that there is a strong effect on the single - particle current .",
    "we have shown how it manifests itself in the dc electrical current which , in turn , can be manipulated by the laser fields . for the case of graphene / ti superlattices ,",
    "the dirac points and single - particle current distributions can be well controlled even by a one - frequency ( monochromatic ) laser field if its electric field is rotated with respect to the gradient of the superlattice potential .",
    "however the dc electric current is expected to be zero due to the high symmetry of @xmath139 .",
    "this is a prediction that can be tested experimentally , even without invoking details beyond the single - particle picture and a full , more complicated calculation of the current .",

    "<S> we show that a dirac point in the electron spectrum can be split into several dirac points whose relative location in momentum space can be efficiently manipulated by changing the characteristics of the laser fields . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the laser - field controlled dirac fermion band structure  dirac fermion time - floquet crystal  allows the manipulation of the electron currents in graphene and topological insulators . </S>",
