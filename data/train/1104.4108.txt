    "event shapes measure geometric properties of collider events .",
    "they are conceptually simpler than the more commonly used jet observables and have been measured with exquisite precision at lepton colliders such as lep @xcite . by comparing to theoretical predictions , these results can be used to extract the strong coupling constant and to search for new particles .",
    "the interest in event shapes has been renewed recently after the fixed - order results at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in qcd perturbation theory have become available @xcite .",
    "however , even with these corrections at hand , the perturbative uncertainty still dominates the error on the extracted value of @xmath3 .",
    "the convergence of the perturbative series can be improved by resumming those perturbative corrections which become dominant near kinematical end - points .",
    "this resummation was performed at next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy for the event shapes measured at lep ; however , to improve the accuracy of @xmath3 it is necessary to also resum subleading logarithms of higher order .",
    "this has been achieved for the event - shape variables thrust @xcite and heavy - jet mass @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we derive , for the first time , all - order formulae for the total and wide jet broadenings , which are free of large logarithms and allow the resummation of higher logarithms also for these quantities .",
    "the jet broadening is defined as follows . with each hadronic event in an @xmath0 collision one associates a thrust axis @xmath4 , which is the direction of maximum three - momentum flow .",
    "the particles of the event can then be divided into two groups : those moving in the forward hemisphere with respect to the thrust direction ( @xmath5 ) , and those moving in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that @xmath4 points to the left and refer to the two groups of particles as the left - moving and right - moving ones , respectively .",
    "the left - broadening is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the transverse momenta of the left - moving particles @xcite @xmath6 and analogously one defines the right - broadening @xmath7 .",
    "usually , one normalizes the broadenings to the center - of - mass energy @xmath8 and defines @xmath9 , but we prefer to work with the dimensionful quantities @xmath10 .",
    "what is measured experimentally is the total broadening @xmath11 as well as the wide broadening @xmath12 .    in the following , we are interested in the region of small but perturbative broadenings , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a typical scale associated with non - perturbative strong - interaction physics . despite the fact that the broadenings are in the perturbative domain , fixed - order perturbation theory breaks down at small values of @xmath10 , because large logarithms arise .",
    "for the fraction of events with total broadening smaller than @xmath15 , for example , one obtains at next - to - leading order , @xmath16 up to terms which vanish in the limit where @xmath17 goes to zero . here and below we normalize to the tree - level total cross section @xmath18 . in the result ( [ rb ] ) the sudakov logarithms are manifest . to obtain reliable predictions for small broadening",
    ", these enhanced corrections must be resummed to all orders . at leading double - logarithmic order this",
    "was achieved in @xcite . to this accuracy",
    "the broadening can be written as a product of two jet functions in laplace space .",
    "an improved version of this result , valid also at the single logarithmic level , was later presented in @xcite . however , an all - order formula for broadening which is free of large logarithms was missing . near the two - jet limit ,",
    "event shapes such as thrust factorize into a convolution of a hard function , two jet functions , and a soft function , and this factorization forms the basis for an all - order resummation of logarithmically enhanced corrections .",
    "this was shown in @xcite for a large class of event - shape variables , but it was also pointed out that this factorization breaks down for broadening . the same class of event shapes was recently reanalyzed in soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) in @xcite , which concluded that the usual effective - theory power counting breaks down for broadening .",
    "while the naive soft - collinear factorization indeed breaks down for broadening , we nevertheless manage to derive in this paper all - order formulae for the total and wide broadening distributions , which are free of large logarithms .",
    "the reason is that the breaking of factorization has a very specific origin . in the effective theory ,",
    "it manifests itself as a collinear anomaly , which generates an additional dependence on the large momentum transfer @xmath19 in the product of the jet and soft functions . in the effective theory",
    "the collinear anomaly is a quantum anomaly in the usual sense , that a symmetry of the classical ( effective ) lagrangian is not preserved by the regularization .",
    "the factorization analysis is similar to the one for small-@xmath20 resummation in drell - yan production @xcite . as in this case , in an intermediate step one needs to introduce additional regulators beyond dimensional regularization in order to obtain well - defined expressions in the effective theory .",
    "when the regulators are removed in the final predictions for physical cross sections , the anomalous @xmath19 dependence remains .",
    "the regulator independence of the product of jet and soft functions gives a strong constraint on the dependence of the individual functions on @xmath19 , implying that this dependence must exponentiate @xcite .",
    "the analysis of jet broadening is complicated by the fact that not only collinear modes , but also a soft mode ( using scet@xmath21 terminology ) , whose momentum components scale as @xmath22 , give a leading contribution to the cross section . in contrast to the present case , this soft mode does not contribute to @xmath20 resummation in drell - yan production at small transverse momentum , because the corresponding loop integrals are scaleless and can be omitted after proper regularization @xcite .",
    "this is no longer the case for jet broadening , since the radiation is restricted to one of the hemispheres .",
    "interestingly , we verified that starting at two - loop order the ultra - soft momentum region @xmath23 also gives non - vanishing contributions to individual diagrams in the presence of the hemisphere constraint .",
    "however , as explained in @xcite , in the sum of all graphs these contributions cancel as a result of the kln theorem , and consequently the ultra - soft region does not contribute to the broadening .     a typical event with small broadening consists of energetic collinear partons in each hemisphere ( blue lines ) accompanied by soft radiation ( red wiggly lines ) .",
    "the total transverse momentum with respect to the thrust axis @xmath4 vanishes in each hemisphere.,scaledwidth=62.0% ]    we have stressed that the jet and soft functions relevant for broadening are not well defined without additional regularization . leaving this issue aside for the moment",
    ", the naive factorization theorem for small broadening has the form @xmath24 the convolutions over @xmath25 arise because the physical broadening is the sum of the collinear and soft broadenings .",
    "the definition of the thrust axis ensures that the total transverse momentum vanishes in each hemisphere , so if the left - moving collinear partons have transverse momentum @xmath26 , the transverse momentum of the soft partons in the left hemisphere must be equal and opposite ( see figure  [ fig : broadening ] ) .",
    "the hard function @xmath27 is the square of the quark vector form factor , and is known to three - loop accuracy @xcite .",
    "the quark jet function for the left - moving collinear partons is given by @xmath28     & \\quad\\times \\delta\\big(b-\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i\\in x } |p_i^\\perp|\\big)\\ ,         \\langle 0|\\chi_\\alpha(0)|x\\rangle\\,\\langle x|\\bar{\\chi}_\\beta(0)|0\\rangle \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a light - like vector along the thrust axis , @xmath30 is its conjugate , and for simplicity we drop the subscript @xmath31 on the variables of the jet function .",
    "the first two @xmath32-distributions ensure that the produced jet @xmath33 has the desired energy and that its total transverse momentum has a given value @xmath34 . in the absence of soft - collinear interactions ,",
    "the collinear scet lagrangian is equivalent to qcd and the collinear quark field @xmath35 can be identified with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the qcd quark field and @xmath38 a straight wilson line along the @xmath39 direction from @xmath40 to @xmath41 ( see e.g.  @xcite for more details ) . in our computation of the jet function",
    ", we will use the standard qcd lagrangian and feynman rules .",
    "the jet function @xmath42 for the right - moving collinear partons is obtained by exchanging @xmath43 in the above formula .",
    "the soft function is obtained as @xmath44 here @xmath45 and @xmath46 are soft wilson lines extending along the @xmath47 and @xmath48 directions .",
    "the final states are split into left and right - moving particles , @xmath49 , which contribute to the respective broadenings .    instead of working with the cross section in momentum space",
    ", it is more convenient to discuss the laplace - transformed cross section @xmath50 it is furthermore beneficial to fourier transform in the momenta @xmath26 and @xmath51 , after which the factorization theorem ( [ naivefac ] ) takes the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the laplace and fourier - transformed jet and soft functions , e.g.   @xmath56 since by rotational invariance the jet functions only depend on the moduli @xmath57 of the transverse - position vectors , we can integrate the soft function over the solid angles associated with these vectors .",
    "introducing the dimensionless variables @xmath58 , the naive factorization formula then takes the final form @xmath59 with @xmath60 the normalization factor @xmath61 is chosen such that for a @xmath62 dimensional space - time the soft function @xmath63 at lowest order . for the lowest - order jet functions , we obtain @xmath64",
    "as mentioned above , the feynman diagrams contributing to the jet and soft functions are not well defined individually in dimensional regularization . to evaluate them ,",
    "we introduce additional analytic regulators @xcite in the qcd diagrams contributing to the broadening .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "let us assume that the qcd vector current produces a quark which ends up in the left - moving jet , while the anti - quark ends up in the right - moving jet .",
    "we now raise all propagators along the quark line to a fractional power , @xmath65 and analogously for the anti - quark line , but with a regulator @xmath66 and an associated scale @xmath67 .",
    "since the qcd diagrams are well defined without additional regulators , this operation is trivial for the full theory , but with the analytic regulators in place the effective - theory diagrams are now also well defined . the individual jet and soft functions in the naive factorization formula ( [ factfinal ] ) exhibit poles in the regulators @xmath68 and @xmath66 , which only cancel in the product of these functions entering the formula for the cross section .",
    "as is explained in detail in @xcite , the regulator on the anti - quark line regularizes the wilson line in the collinear jet function of left - moving particles . the usual eikonal feynman rule for the emission of a left - moving collinear gluon with momentum @xmath69 from the wilson line @xmath70 in the scet quark field @xmath71",
    "is modified to @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the total _",
    "right - moving _ momentum , which fulfils @xmath74 at leading power in @xmath75 .",
    "similarly , the rule for the emission of a right - moving collinear gluon from the corresponding wilson line is obtained by replacing @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 in the above result .",
    "note that the usual eikonal identities no longer hold in the presence of the analytic regulators .",
    "the feynman rules for multiple emissions from the regularized object @xmath70 are thus more complicated than for standard wilson lines , but they can easily be derived by considering the corresponding regularized qcd diagrams .",
    "the regulators @xmath68 and @xmath66 also regularize the soft emission diagrams in the effective theory .",
    "the eikonal factor relevant for gluon emission from the regularized soft wilson line @xmath45 is replaced by @xmath80 the same expression with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath78 , and @xmath83 holds for @xmath46 , the wilson line describing soft emissions from the anti - quark .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as a further test of our calculations , we compare our results to the fixed - order calculation of the jet broadening cross section .",
    "to our knowledge , an analytical result for this quantity is not available in the literature  not even at @xmath84 , which is leading order ( lo ) for the distribution .",
    "numerically , the cross section can be computed to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) using the event2 generator @xcite .",
    "the nnlo result has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ event ] shows the difference between the nlo result as computed using event2 and the nll singular terms predicted by our resummation formula . in the figure we show @xmath85 the leading singular terms for small @xmath15 , which are predicted at nll and can be obtained by expanding ( [ nll ] ) , are given by @xmath86 \\\\     & \\quad\\mbox{}+ c_f c_a \\left [ \\frac{88}{3}\\,l^2      + \\left ( \\frac{4\\pi^2}{3 } - \\frac{70}{9 } \\right ) l \\right ]       + c_f t_f n_f \\left ( - \\frac{32}{3}\\,l^2 + \\frac{8}{9}\\,l\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath87 . at leading power in @xmath88 , all terms in @xmath89",
    "are predicted by our results , while the constant term in @xmath90 can only be obtained by extending our analysis to nnll order . for @xmath91 ,",
    "the singular terms dominate the cross section .",
    "we should thus find that the difference @xmath92 tends to zero for @xmath91 , while @xmath93 approaches a constant in the limit of small broadening .",
    "this is indeed what is observed in figure  [ event ] .",
    "let us note that a similar numerical comparison was also shown in @xcite .",
    "however , we have run event2 with a very low cutoff of @xmath94 and have computed @xmath95 events using quadruple precision , which was computationally not yet feasible at the time when that paper was published .",
    "using effective field - theory methods , we have presented the first all - order factorization theorem for jet broadening distributions in @xmath0 collisions , in which all large logarithmic corrections arising for small broadening are resummed .",
    "our result has several interesting features .",
    "first , the broadening receives both collinear and soft contributions , with the collinear jets in each hemisphere recoiling against the soft radiation .",
    "these recoil effects were discovered in @xcite and become non - trivial at nll order .",
    "second , the individual jet and soft functions are only defined if additional regulators beyond dimensional regularization are introduced . we have used analytic regulators for that purpose .",
    "the individual functions then contain divergences in these regulators , which cancel in the product of jet and soft functions entering the formula for the differential cross section .",
    "when the regulators are removed an anomalous @xmath19 dependence arises , which constitutes a new source of large logarithms .",
    "such an anomaly also appears in transverse - momentum resummation in drell - yan production @xcite and in electroweak sudakov resummation @xcite . using similar arguments as in these papers",
    ", we have shown that the associated anomalous @xmath19 dependence of the broadening distribution exponentiates .",
    "the analytical results obtained in this paper allow us to resum logarithms to nll accuracy , and in this way we have reproduced the results of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have checked the resummed expressions against the numerical fixed - order results and find that our expressions correctly reproduce the numerical results for small broadening .",
    "it would be interesting to obtain nnll accuracy for the total and wide broadening and to combine the resummed expressions with the existing fixed - order results at nnlo obtained in @xcite .",
    "this could be used for a precise determination of @xmath3 from the existing measurements of the total and wide broadening distributions . for the event - shape variable thrust ,",
    "the resummation has been performed to n@xmath96ll accuracy @xcite , and this result was used for a precision determination of @xmath3 in @xcite .",
    "the resulting value is much lower than the world average of @xmath3 , and it is important to cross check whether other event shapes lead to a consistent value , if only to gauge whether the uncertainty estimates are reliable . to obtain nnll accuracy for broadening , one needs the one - loop expressions for the jet and soft functions and the two - loop expression for the anomaly function @xmath97 .",
    "the one - loop soft function has already been given in this paper .",
    "the computation of the one - loop jet function is however more complicated . finally , to obtain the two - loop anomaly coefficient one needs to compute the two - loop divergence of the soft function in the analytic regulators .",
    "we hope to report results for these quantities in a future publication .",
    "_ note added : _ while this paper was in preparation the preprint @xcite appeared , which also considers the resummation of jet broadening in the context of scet .",
    "this work contains the factorization theorem ( [ naivefac ] ) , but uses an alternative analytic regulator for the jet and soft functions .",
    "in contrast to our work , the regularization is introduced directly in scet instead of qcd , and it is not clear to us whether qcd is recovered once this regulator is removed .",
    "more importantly , the result for the total broadening presented in @xcite does not account for the recoil effects discussed in @xcite and is therefore missing the factor @xmath98 in ( [ nll1 ] ) and ( [ nll ] ) .",
    "it is thus incorrect beyond the leading double - logarithmic order .    _",
