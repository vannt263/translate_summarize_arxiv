    "the recently discovered @xmath5-leg ladder cuprate materials@xcite form an interesting testing ground for ideas regarding strongly correlated electron systems . just as for the two - dimensional layered cuprates ,",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1  hamiltonian is believed to provide a basic model which contains the general features of the ladder systems .",
    "in particular , the undoped , even - leg heisenberg ladders have been shown to exhibit a spin gap@xcite , while the odd - leg ladders have no spin gap , in agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "various calculations on the doped 2-leg ladder find that in the ground state the doped holes form @xmath4-like pairs , and the system is characterized by power - law pair - field and @xmath6-cdw correlations@xcite .",
    "a recent study of the 4-leg doped @xmath0-@xmath1  model@xcite found evidence for three types of phases , depending upon the ratio of @xmath7 and the hole doping @xmath3 . at low doping ,",
    "when holes are first added to the insulating state , they form a dilute gas of @xmath4-like pairs . at higher",
    "doping , the holes arrange themselves into fluctuating domain walls while maintaining significant @xmath4   pair - field correlations .",
    "finally , at sufficiently large @xmath7 values ( @xmath8 ) , phase separation occurs .",
    "based upon these results , it is interesting to explore what happens when an odd - leg ladder is doped .",
    "here we discuss results obtained from density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations@xcite for a doped 3-leg @xmath0-@xmath1  ladder .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1  hamiltonian which we will study has the form @xmath9 here @xmath10 denotes nearest - neighbor sites on the ladder , @xmath11 is a spin index , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are electron spin and creation operators , @xmath14 and the gutzwiller projector @xmath15 excludes configurations with doubly occupied sites . for the dmrg calculations discussed here we have used open boundary conditions for @xmath16 clusters and have set @xmath17 , which is close to the value expected for the cuprates . from 800 to 1500 states were kept per block .",
    "truncation errors were typically @xmath18 .    in the next section , ii ,",
    "we begin by showing the most probable ground state hole configurations and the over - all structure of the charge and spin correlations for different hole densities . while these projections show only a caricature of the groundstate which contains a huge superposition of states corresponding to large fluctuations of the structures shown , they provide a useful picture for the discussion which follows . in particular",
    ", the average hole rung density shows that the domain wall structure seen in the projections can survive in a ground state expectation value .    in section iii",
    ", we calculate the momentum distribution of the holes and use it to discuss the nature of the quasiparticle excitation bands . following this , in section iv , we examine spin correlation and the behavior of the spin gap in the doped system . in section v we discuss the orbital structure of the pairs and the pairing correlations .",
    "section vi contains our conclusions .",
    "as we have previously discussed@xcite , two holes doped into a 3-leg @xmath0-@xmath1  ladder are not bound for physically relevant values of @xmath7 .",
    "however , we have found that as holes are added at a fixed value of @xmath7 , the system evolves from a gas of holes to an array of domain walls as shown in fig .",
    "1 . this figure shows the most probable configuration of holes in the system for @xmath19 obtained by maximizing the ground state expectation value of @xmath20 with @xmath21 the hole projection operator for the @xmath22 lattice site . here",
    "@xmath23 are chosen to give the most probable location of @xmath24 holes , and for this configuration , the diameter of the dark circles gives the probability of finding the @xmath25 hole on a given site .    at low hole concentrations ,",
    "the most likely configuration consists of individual holes as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . the most probable location for the holes are on the outer legs and as we will see reflect the fact that in the dilute limit the holes are doped into the odd single particle band .",
    "as the density @xmath3 of holes increases , fluctuating domain wall - like arrays appear .",
    "this initially occurs as a domain wall running down the center chain as seen in fig .",
    "1(b ) . at higher densities ,",
    "fluctuating diagonal three - hole domain walls appear as shown in fig .",
    "the local structure of these diagonal domain walls is similar to that of the diagonal domain walls observed on 4-leg ladders@xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows a section of the lattice which contains a three - hole domain wall .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the strength of the exchange field @xmath26 when the holes occupy their most likely positions .",
    "the strong diagonal singlet correlations in fig .",
    "2(a ) are similar to those which are found for @xmath4-pairs on the even leg ladders as well as on 2d lattices .",
    "these diagonal singlet correlations reflect the fluctuating nature of the wall which reduces the kinetic energy of localization , while at the same time minimizing the exchange energy . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , an external staggered magnetic field has been applied to the left - hand end of the ladder , and one can see that the antiferromagnetic spin background undergoes a @xmath27-phase shift as it crosses the domain wall .",
    "another view of this is given in fig .",
    "3(a ) which shows the average charge density and the spin structure . here , as in fig .",
    "2(b ) , a small staggered magnetic field has been applied to the left hand end .",
    "3(b ) shows a view of the longitudinal domain wall of fig .",
    "here there is a small staggered field along the bottom leg .",
    "the resulting spin moments on the top leg are @xmath27-phase - shifted with respect to the bottom leg .",
    "the crossover from longitudinal to transverse ( diagonal ) domain walls appears to be smooth as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the development of transverse domain walls is also clearly evident in fig .",
    "4 , which shows the average rung density @xmath28 the open boundary conditions break translational invariance , allowing density variations to be seen . at low hole and moderate hole densities ( the lower two curves ) ,",
    "the average rung density is fairly uniform , corresponding to individual holes and to a longitudinal domain wall . at a filling of 18 holes on a @xmath29 ladder , corresponding to @xmath30 ,",
    "six three - hole diagonal domain walls are clearly evident in the top curve in fig .",
    "the one - electron eigen operators of a non - interacting 3-leg ladder have the structure @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding eigen energies are @xmath35 the states @xmath32 and @xmath34 are even under reflection about the center chain , while the @xmath36 state is odd .    using the dmrg technique , we have calculated the equal time expectation value @xmath37 and from this constructed the momentum occupation expectation values for the three @xmath38-bands @xmath39 . for comparison , the momentum occupation for a single chain @xmath0-@xmath1  model with @xmath17 and a hole density @xmath40 is shown in fig .",
    "the decrease of @xmath41 sharpens as the length of the @xmath0-@xmath1  chain is increased and marks the fermi wave vector @xmath2 of the single - chain luttinger liquid .",
    "the structure of @xmath42 for the odd @xmath43 band is similar to that of the single chain @xmath0-@xmath1  system .",
    "this suggests that at low doping , the @xmath43 band of the 3-leg system is not gapped at the fermi surface , while the two even bands at @xmath44 and @xmath34 appear to be gapped .",
    "when the density of holes is increased , all three bands appear to be gapped , as shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) for @xmath45 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "these conclusions are confirmed by direct observation of @xmath37 as a function of @xmath46 ( not shown ) : at low densities , power law decay is observed in the odd mode , and exponential decay in the even modes , while at higher densities , all modes show exponential decay .",
    "based upon the quasi - particle momentum distributions discussed in section iii , we would expect that the lightly doped 3-leg ladder would exhibit power - law antiferromagnetic correlations arising from the @xmath43 quasi - particle band . a log - log plot of @xmath47 for @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) and is consistent with the power law decay one would expect for a one - dimensional luttinger liquid . at higher hole densities @xmath45 and 0.1875 , the spin - spin correlations @xmath49 are found to decay exponentially as shown in fig .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of @xmath50 discussed in the previous section .",
    "we have also calculated the spin gap @xmath51 as a function of the hole doping @xmath3 for a @xmath52 ladder . here",
    "@xmath53 is the ground state energy with a given value of total spin @xmath54 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "we believe that the non - vanishing spin gap for @xmath55 is a finite size effect and that the spin gap will extrapolate to zero in the low - doping region . at higher doping , there is a spin gap consistent with the exponential decay of the spin - spin correlations .",
    "in order to determine the orbital structure of the pairs , we have calculated the off - diagonal expectation value @xmath56 holes .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "9(a ) . here",
    ", one member of a singlet pair is located at the site marked by the solid circle .",
    "the shaded circles indicate the amplitude and sign for finding the second member .",
    "the internal structure of the pair has a @xmath4-like form , although it is somewhat asymmetric with an admixture of @xmath11 due to the 3-leg nature of the cluster .",
    "we have also calculated the pair field ",
    "pair field correlation function latexmath:[\\[d(\\ell_x ) = \\langle\\psi_0| \\delta_{i_x+\\ell_x } \\delta^\\dagger_{i_x }    @xmath4-like pair around the @xmath58 site of the middle leg , @xmath59 @xmath60 is plotted in fig .",
    "9(b ) for various values of the hole doping . in the regime of low doping @xmath61 ,",
    "the pair field correlations are negligible . at larger values of doping @xmath3 ,",
    "short range pair field correlations are present . however , as shown by the semi - log plot in fig .",
    "9(c ) , these pairing correlations appear to decay exponentially at large distances .",
    "while the pair - field correlations do not exhibit the power law decay found for a two - leg ladder , there are clearly significant short range pairing correlations as seen in fig",
    "in order to examine these , we have calculated the response of the system to a proximity pairing field @xmath62 here @xmath63 adds a singlet electron pair to sites @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in this case , the dmrg calculation breaks up the hilbert space into @xmath66 modulo 2 sectors , keeping total @xmath54 as a good quantum number .",
    "the response was then determined by measuring the strength of the induced pair field in both the @xmath67 and @xmath68 directions , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for all sites @xmath64 .",
    "the interaction @xmath71 couples equally to extended @xmath11-pairs and @xmath4   pairs .",
    "however , in all the cases that we have studied which show significant pairing correlations , @xmath69 and @xmath72 have different signs , reflecting the @xmath4-like symmetry of the response .    in order to compare the @xmath4   response of the 3-leg ladder with that of the 2- and 4-leg ladders , we have made similar measurements on each of these ladders .",
    "figure 10 shows a plot of the average @xmath4   pair field response @xmath73 for @xmath74- , 2- , 3- , and 4-leg ladders versus doping @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear from this result that the 3-leg ladder has a comparable @xmath4   pair field response to that of both the 2- and 4-leg ladders .",
    "this is expected from both weak coupling rpa calculations@xcite and renormalization - group studies@xcite . however , in the presence of the 3-hole striped domain wall structure shown in figs . 1 , 2 , and 3",
    ", it may seem unusual . in order to understand it in the present framework ,",
    "we have studied the typical hole configurations which contribute to the pair field correlations for a @xmath75 ladder with 6 holes@xcite . in fig .",
    "11(a ) , we show typical hole configurations in a system with two diagonal domain walls .",
    "these configurations show the large fluctuations present in the domain walls .",
    "these large fluctuations allow a significant pairing response despite the presence of the domain wall charge density wave . in fig .",
    "11(b ) , we show some of the specific hole configurations which give rise to pairing correlations .",
    "in particular , we measure latexmath:[\\[\\langle\\psi_0| \\delta_{i , i+y } \\delta^\\dagger_{j , j+y }   p(\\ell_1,\\ell_2,\\ldots,\\ell_{n-2 } )    @xmath66 is the number of holes . here",
    "the two shaded holes on the right indicate where a singlet pair of holes is removed and the two shaded holes on the left where a singlet pair is added .",
    "these points are kept fixed .",
    "the black points show typical locations of the remaining four holes , obtained using a monte carlo procedure using dmrg to measure the probability of a configuration , given by the absolute value of eq .",
    "( 14)@xcite .",
    "the configurations show that groups of one , two , and three holes are common .",
    "most often , a pair is created or destroyed next to a third hole , thus converting a domain wall into a single hole and vice - versa . from these one",
    "obtains a general idea of how pairing correlations and fluctuating domain walls coexist .",
    "from these dmrg results for the 3-leg @xmath0-@xmath1  ladder , the following picture emerges .",
    "initially , when a low concentration of holes is added to the 3-leg ladder , the holes form a dilute gas with a uniform density , except near the ends of the open ladder .",
    "the holes tend to occupy the outer legs , associated with the odd quasiparticle mode .",
    "the momentum occupation @xmath42 indicates that the @xmath43 odd mode is gapless , while the @xmath32 and @xmath34 even modes are gapped . in this low doping regime ,",
    "the spin - spin correlations exhibit an approximate power law decay , and we believe that the spin gap extrapolates to zero .",
    "the pairing correlations are negligible .    at higher hole densities ,",
    "fluctuating domain walls appear .",
    "these walls have a similar structure to the domain walls found in previous dmrg studies . for @xmath45 and 0.1875 ,",
    "the change in momentum occupation @xmath77 is broad for all three bands , consistent with the finite spin gap observed on the @xmath52 lattice for @xmath78 . in this regime the spin - spin correlations decay exponentially and there are significant short - range @xmath4-like pairing correlations .",
    "these results have a number of similarities to other recently reported results for the 3-leg ladder .",
    "rice , et .",
    "al.@xcite have carried out lanczos calculations on doped @xmath79 clusters as well as a mean field analysis .",
    "they suggest that below a critical doping the odd band forms a luttinger liquid and the two even bands an insulating spin liquid .",
    "our results for the momentum occupation @xmath42 , and the spin - spin correlations support this picture .",
    "renormalization group and bosonization calculations@xcite for a 3-leg ladder suggest that the doped isotropic @xmath0-@xmath1   system has a c2s1 phase with two gapless charge modes and one gapless spin mode .",
    "this is also consistent with what we have found .",
    "however , in addition to power law spin - spin correlations , and a gapless odd mode , this phase is expected to have power law pairing correlations . however , at low doping we find that pairing correlations are not present ( see fig .",
    "9(b ) ) . similarly , mean field theory@xcite and rpa calculations@xcite suggest that the system will exhibit pairing correlations at low doping .",
    "however , it appears from the dmrg results that a critical hole density of order @xmath80 is required before this occurs .",
    "rice , et .",
    "al.@xcite have argued that this critical doping @xmath81 is associated with a doping concentration at which the chemical potential becomes equal to the two hole bound state energy of the spin liquid . from small cluster lanczos calculations they estimate @xmath82 , but note that it could be less , while as discussed in sec .",
    "iv , we find an onset of a spin gap at about half this value .    at larger values of doping",
    "we indeed find measurable @xmath4-like pair field correlations .",
    "however they appear to decay exponentially rather than as a power law .",
    "nevertheless , other measurements , such as the `` proximity '' response of the 3-leg ladder indicate that significant pair correlations are present . in this same doping regime",
    "we find a spin gap and observe that the momentum occupation is broadened for all three quasi - particle modes . except for the absence of power law pair field correlations and the prominence of the domain wall structures , this higher doping regime has a number of features similar to a luther - emery liquid .",
    "rice , et . al.@xcite have suggested that the system makes a transition into a luther - emery liquid when the doping is such that holes can enter the even - parity quasi - particle modes .",
    "the present work also shows that there is a close relationship between the appearance of fluctuating domain wall configurations and pairing@xcite . in particular , both longitudinal [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] and transverse ( diagonal ) [ fig .",
    "1(c ) ] domain walls occur in the doping regime where the pairing correlations appear .",
    "however , in this case , these domains are not produced by a competition between phase separation and long range coulomb interaction@xcite . for 3-leg ladders ,",
    "phase separation requires unphysically large values of @xmath7 and there is no long range coulomb interaction in our model . in the present work ,",
    "the domain walls arise as a compromise to minimize the kinetic energy of the holes and the exchange energy of the spin background .",
    "the local structure of the domain walls shown in fig .",
    "2 exhibits hole - hole correlations and exchange bonding @xmath83 correlations similar to those associated with pairs@xcite .",
    "in addition , as shown in fig .",
    "11 , pairs can fluctuate between the domain walls .",
    "this is similar to the 4-leg ladder except that in the 3-leg ladder , the three - hole diagonal walls contain an extra quasiparticle .",
    "thus we believe that the common feature associated with pairing in the @xmath5-leg @xmath0-@xmath1  ladders is the formation of domain walls containing @xmath4  correlated pairs of holes . on the two - leg ladder ,",
    "these domain walls appear simply as rung pairs .",
    "on the 4-leg ladder at a doping where the proximity effect response @xmath84 shown in fig .",
    "11 is large , one clearly sees the formation of four - hole domain walls composed of fluctuating @xmath4  pairs@xcite . in the present 3-leg system , the domain wall structures form at higher doping levels and it is in this doping regime that pairing correlations",
