    "as has been shown by numerous papers , the dynamics of the magnetosphere during the development of magnetic storms significantly depends on the type of interplanetary driver ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these types of drivers are following : body of interplanetary cme ( icme ) including magnetic cloud ( mc ) and ejecta , and compression regions before high - speed solar wind stream ( corotating interplanetary region ",
    "cir ) and before icme ( sheath ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently we showed that the dynamics of recovery phase of magnetic storms depends on the interplanetary driver types @xcite .",
    "in particular we found that the durations of the main phase and the recovery phase correlate for cir- and sheath - induced storms and there is no dependence for these durations for mc- and ejecta - induced storms . in this brief paper",
    "we will analyze data in details and give a physical interpretation of this result .",
    "we use the same data set that we used in our previous papers @xcite : the measurements of @xmath2 index ( see http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.html ) and our catalog of large - scale interplanetary events for the period of 19762000 ( see the web site ftp://www.iki.rssi.ru/pub/omni and paper by @xcite ) , prepared on the basis of omni dataset of interplanetary plasma and magnetic field parameters ( see http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov ) and paper by @xcite ) . the detailed description of the technique of the solar wind classification and comparison to magnetic storms is provided in several papers @xcite .    method of determination of durations of the main and recovery phases is schematically shown in figure 1 . to consider the existence of fast ( initial ) and slow ( second ) parts of the recovery ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we calculate two durations : the initial time interval from the minimum of the @xmath2 index up to @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , respectively .",
    "analysis of the two durations @xmath7 and @xmath8 allows us to compare the durations of the fast and slow parts of the recovery phase .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite we studied the durations of main @xmath1 and recovery @xmath7 and @xmath8 phases of storms induced by different interplanetary drivers and found the anticorrelation for cir- and sheath - induced storms .",
    "it is naturally to suggest that all durations depend on the magnitude of storms .",
    "however , the selection of data on the storm magnitude decreases the number of events and accuracy of analyze , and did not allow us to make reliable conclusions .",
    "so , we study a new variable @xmath0 which includes both duration @xmath1 and storm magnitude @xmath9 , and is an average temporal derivation of @xmath2 index or a storm development rate .",
    "figure 2 presents the dependence between the storm development rate @xmath10 and the fast and slow durations of recovery phase ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) for different drivers .",
    "three lower panels ( from the bottom panel up ) show individual events for sheath- , cir- and icme - induced storms , left and right coulombs present data for fast and slow durations .",
    "the straight lines through the data are linear fits to the points in the two - logarithmic scale ( i.e. , power law approximations of data ) .",
    "the top panels represent results of data fitting for the lower panels and allow one to compare them for various drivers .",
    "the correlation coefficients @xmath11 for all panels are presented in table . to emphasize the statistical significance of the results , we present the parameter @xmath12 $ ] and probability @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "sheath - induced storms have the most deep dependence between the storm development rate and both fast and slow durations . despite a wide spread of points ,",
    "these dependences possess rather high statistical significance ( probability @xmath13 = 90 and 95 % ) .",
    "cir - induced storms have similar parameters for fast duration @xmath7 but for slow durations @xmath8 the fitting line inclination decreases with simultaneous decreasing correlation coefficient @xmath11 and probability @xmath13 .",
    "icme - induced storms have low values of line inclination , correlation coefficient and probability for both types of recovery durations , i.e. there is no dependence between the storm development rate and both fast and slow durations .",
    "in accordance with formula by @xcite in the case of neglecting the term related to the decay of the ring current at the main phase and numerous papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , for various interplanetary drivers the measured and density - corrected @xmath2 and @xmath14 indexes may be approximated by a linear function of the integral of interplanetary convective electric field @xmath15 with high accuracy ( the correlation coefficients are 0.98-0.99 ) , i.e. derivative of @xmath2 index is proportional to electric field @xmath16 . as approximate equality",
    "@xmath17 is fair , the obtained results give the indirect indications in favor of a hypothesis that the durations of recovery for magnetic storms induced by cir and sheath correlate with the average electric field during main phase @xmath18 .",
    "reduction of correlation for slow recovery duration @xmath8 for cir - induced storms can be explained by the fact that at the second part of recovery phase the external factors start prevailing over internal magnetospheric processes , and the high - speed solar wind after cir is characterized by higher level of disturbances of plasma and magnetic field parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , than in the icmes after sheath .",
    "as we showed earlier ( @xcite ) , the interplanetary - magnetospheric coupling coefficient between the derivative of @xmath2 index and average electric field @xmath18 depends on the driver type .",
    "therefore the lower correlation in figure 2 for icme - induced storms than for cir / sheath - induced storms can be connected with lower coupling coefficients for mc / ejecta - induced storms in comparison with coupling coefficients for cir / sheath - induced storms .",
    "we analyzed the temporal profiles of @xmath2 index for magnetic storms induced by various types of interplanetary drivers : compression regions cir ( 85 storms ) and sheath ( 71 ) , and bodies of interplanetary cme ( 158 ) .",
    "in addition to our previous paper @xcite where we compared the durations of main phase @xmath1 and the short and long durations of recovery phase @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( respectively , at the levels of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , here we study the dependences of the development rate @xmath10 on recovery phase durations @xmath7 and @xmath8 . obtained results allows us to make following conclusions .",
    "\\2 . the storm development rate @xmath10 correlates with only short duration @xmath7 and does not correlate with long @xmath8 duration for cir - induced storms .",
    "the absence of correlation with long duration may be connected with high variability of solar wind and imf parameters in the high - speed streams after cir regions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , in contrast with smooth changing parameters in icme bodies after sheath regions .",
    "the magnetosphere processes , which are responsible for storm activity , are suggested to be different for icme- and cir / sheath - induced storms .",
    "this may be connected with various interplanetary - magnetospheric coupling coefficients for different interplanetary drivers ( @xcite ) .",
