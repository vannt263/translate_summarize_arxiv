    "the prototypical examples of noninteracting topological states of matter are categorized by quantized invariants , corresponding to ( sets of ) energy bands that are separated by gaps from the rest of the band structure . a conceptual step forward in the topological characterization of materials was the definition of topological invariants for systems in which energy gaps vanish and bands touch  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the presence of inversion and time - reversal , two - dimensional spinless graphene exhibits a quantized topological invariant . in the vicinity of isolated points in the brillouin zone , where dirac nodes occur",
    ", the topological invariant is obtained by integrating the berry potential over a closed line encircling these points .",
    "similarly , in three dimensions , nodes may appear in pairs of opposite chirality , i.e. , as sources and sinks of berry flux  @xcite .",
    "the two nodes in each pair can be pushed apart in reciprocal space by breaking the product of time reversal and inversion symmetries . the low - energy theory describing electrons at such a nodal point is encapsulated in the weyl equation . when the chemical potential crosses or is close to these nodal points in a material , the latter is called a weyl semimetal ( wsm )  @xcite . unlike dirac nodes in graphene",
    ", weyl nodes can not be gapped or otherwise removed from the band structure by small translation - symmetry preserving perturbations .",
    "when a closed fermi surface ( fs ) patch encloses only one weyl node , one can define a fs chern number , which is equal to the topological charge of the node  @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental evidence for the discovery of weyl fermions in taas and nbas was provided by angle - resolved photoemission spectrocopy  @xcite and ( magneto)transport measurements  @xcite .",
    "the theory that guided the discovery  @xcite attracted immediate attention , because the materials are stoichiometric and therefore easy to synthesize .",
    "the prediction of a second type of wsms rendered another two compounds , wte@xmath0 and mote@xmath0 , promising candidates for realization  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting hallmarks of a wsm is the presence of open constant - energy contours in its surface band structure called fermi arcs  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the corresponding surface states is a direct consequence of the nonzero topological charge associated with a weyl node .",
    "since they pertain solely to the surface , these previously elusive fs features are also amenable to observation via scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) .",
    "an analysis of quasiparticle - interference ( qpi ) patterns in the fourier - transformed local density of states ( ftldos ) at the boundary of a material can yield important properties of surface quantum states  @xcite .",
    "the potential for detecting fermi arcs with sts was recognized in earlier theoretical work  @xcite , but the qpi fingerprints of fermi arcs remain theoretically and experimentally unresolved .",
    "the purpose of the present manuscript is to determine the unique signatures of fermi arcs in the qpi patterns obtained by sts measurements at the surface of a wsm .",
    "first , we identify the most elementary qpi pattern shapes in the presence of a single fermi arc and define criteria for their unambiguous experimental observation .",
    "since both discovered and candidate wsms host two or more pairs of weyl nodes and will hence have more than one fermi arcs on a given surface , we examine the fundamental qpi features when more than one arcs coexist on the same surface . in the case of type-2 wsms ,",
    "the boundary fs will comprise of both fermi arcs and electron and hole pockets .",
    "we therefore study the fate of the nontrivial characteristics in qpi when surface modes are allowed to scatter into states originating from the bulk .",
    "we then pinpoint all aforementioned signatures in qpi patterns obtained from both generic tight - binding models and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations for mote@xmath0 and taas .",
    "the ftldos obtained from sts measurements can be generally expressed as  @xcite @xmath1 ,   \\label{eq : ftldos}\\\\    & \\lambda(\\bm{q},e ) = \\int \\mathrm{d}\\bm{k}\\ , \\text{tr}[g(\\bm{k}+\\bm{q},e)t(\\bm{k}+\\bm{q},\\bm{k};e)g(\\bm{k},e ) ] \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the retarded green s function for a clean sample and @xmath3 is the @xmath4-matrix associated with disorder  @xcite . on heuristic grounds , the power spectrum @xmath5 is commonly approximated by the autocorrelation of the spectral functions  @xcite @xmath6 , \\label{eq : j } \\\\   &",

    ", we will consider two types of autocorrelations : the joint density of states ( jdos ) @xmath10 with @xmath7 being an empty set , and the spin - dependent scattering probability ( ssp ) @xmath11 with @xmath7 being solely electron spin .",
    "the jdos is particularly important in studying a wsm that lacks any symmetry  this is the most generic wsm although it is still to be found experimentally ; the ssp includes suppressions due to the symmetries of the eigenstates and is hence important for wsms that respect time - reversal symmetry  the case for all confirmed wsms .",
    "the jdos ignores all matrix - element effects inherent in ftldos and takes into account all energetically allowed scattering wavevectors on equal footing , whereas ssp includes only the scattering suppression that comes from the spin content of the wavefunction .",
    "approximating ftldos with jdos / ssp amounts to replacing the impurity landscape with a single scattering center , which can be easily treated within band theory .",
    "even though the rationale behind evaluating jdos / ssp instead of the full ftldos is clear , it is not always straightforward to rigorously connect one to the other  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we have verified that our key findings based on jdos / ssp calculations are qualitatively the same in the full ftldos of our tight - binding models  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the jdos patterns most broadly associated with fermi arcs .",
    "first , we illustrate the key points phenomenologically , by assuming that the fermi arcs have a constant curvature and a constant spectral density . the fermi level is supposed to cross the bulk band structure only at the nodal points , so that only boundary modes are visible in the surface fs .",
    "the spectral function of an individual arc at a fixed energy can be parametrized as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the offset of the circle center from the origin , @xmath14 the circle radius and @xmath15 the angle subtended by the arc .",
    "the endpoints of the arc are located at @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the jdos generated solely by this single arc is independent of @xmath13 , while @xmath14 and @xmath18 change only its size and orientation , respectively .",
    "the only parameter that affects the shape of the arc is @xmath15 .",

    "the most distinctive feature is the presence of a pinch point at @xmath25 for arcs with @xmath26 .",
    "this is a unique characteristic of an open contour in the surface bz and can be interpreted as follows : a pinch point exists as long as scattering within a fs contour vanishes at all wavevectors along a specific direction .",
    "when such a pinch point exists in the qpi pattern , then the contour that generates it must be open . consider a translation of the spectral function of an arc defined as @xmath27 , with @xmath28 a unitary vector defining a direction in @xmath29-space and @xmath30 .",

    "it is not always possible to unambiguously attribute the shapes of cross - correlations to a specific arc arrangement .    in both phenomenological and tight - binding modelings of fermi arcs",
    ", we have assumed that the fermi level is crossing the bulk bands exactly at the weyl nodes , leading to a bulk fs consisting of isolated points .",
    "when the chemical potential is changed sufficiently , the projection of the bulk fs appears at the boundary .",
    "this situation is shown in fig .",

    "two oblong fs pockets appear at the ends of each arc . upon deviating from @xmath105 further ,",
    "the pockets increase in size and finally merge into a ribbon that connects the ends of each arc .",
    "the bulk contributions lead to new features and larger intensity around @xmath25 in the ssp , but due to the fact that the fermi arcs are the dominant surface fs feature , the figure - eight pattern and pinch point are recovered once again , in full analogy with our findings for mote@xmath110 .",
    "in the tight - binding calculations , we obtain the green s function @xmath111 at the surface of a semi - infinite system in the @xmath112 direction , with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath37 and @xmath94 , using an iterative scheme for the evaluation of the surface transfer matrix  @xcite .",
    "we then evaluate the surface spectral function @xmath113 , as well as the spin - resolved spectral function @xmath114 $ ] , and calculate their autocorrelations to obtain @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the band basis",
    ", @xmath111 is a diagonal matrix with entries @xmath115^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath65 is the band index and @xmath116 the band dispersion . when @xmath117 , the spectral functions become sums of delta functions .",
    "in this work , we assume a small but finite @xmath118 , which broadens the delta functions into lorentzians of half - width at half - maximum equal to @xmath118 .",
    "this is done to emulate the broadening of the bands in real materials , as well as in our dft calculations . due to this broadening",
    ", there is a finite density in the vicinity of the pinch point at the origin [ see figs .  2(b , d ) ] , caused by the finite width of the fs contour line . in particular , a finite lifetime broadening @xmath119 has been included in the green s functions that yield figs .",

    "the surface fs of taas contains segments that cross the boundary of the first bz .",
    "truncating the fs at the first bz boundary would lead to false open contours , which would be misidentified as fermi arcs in the qpi pattern .",
    "such a truncation would furthermore be unnatural , as there is no physical reason for a sharp cutoff of scattering at a certain momentum . in practice",
    ", the overall qpi pattern does not depend very sensitively on whether one chooses to delimit the reciprocal space or not .",
    "however , the universal indicators for fermi arcs become ambiguous when contours are artificially cut .    the more physical way to evaluate the qpi",
    "is to assume a form factor that envelops the spectral function .",
    "the reason for this is the interstitial spatial content of the rather localized wannier wavefunctions used to simulate the electronic structure of a material  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a decay of the measured dos as one moves away from the first bz center . to obtain the results shown in fig .  4 of the main text , we have used the explicit form @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "the spectral functions in eq .",
    "( 3 ) of the main text are multiplied by @xmath123 before the integration .",
    "the decay of the form factor means that the qpi at points @xmath90 and @xmath91 comes predominantly from fs features close to the first bz boundary , as scattering from the zone center at these wavevectors is heavily suppressed .",
    "one can use this to better resolve the qpi contributions close to @xmath25 coming from fs features close to the zone center . in fig .",
    "[ fig : taassm ] we illustrate the extreme case where the fs is truncated outside a certain range ( i.e. , the form factor becomes a theta function ) so that the bow - tie features are included in their entirety while the spoon features in the second bz are discarded .",
    "then , by subtracting the qpi at @xmath90 and @xmath91 from the center of the pattern , we recover the autocorrelations of the fermi arcs closest to the bz center .",
    "the same procedure has been carried out in fig .",
    "4(g ) for the more realistic case were the form factor decays smoothly , as described above .",
    "this method of uncovering qpi features in the vicinity of @xmath25 may also be useful for the analysis of experimental data .",
    "the signatures of fermi arcs in the ab initio results presented in the main text do not have a sensitive dependence on the probing energy . to exemplify this , in fig .",

    "electronic structure calculations in this work were performed with density - functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package  @xcite , and use the core - electron projector augmented wave basis sets  @xcite with the generalized - gradient method  @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is included self - consistently .",
    "for the bulk calculation of mote@xmath110 , the cutoff energy for wave - function expansion is 350  ev , and the @xmath29-point sampling grid is @xmath124 .",

    "the projected surface states are obtained from the surface green function of the semi - infinite system  @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "the maximally localized wannier functions  @xcite have been constructed from the first - principles calculations .    for taas , due to the discrepancy of the similar wannier - based surface calculations and unambiguous experimental observation",
    ", we preferred to perform a slab calculation of nine surface unit cells in thickness .",
