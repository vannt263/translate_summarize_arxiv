    "hence , regardless of the considered crystal structures , the fe atoms sitting in octahedral cages display a hs to ls transition under pressure .    from the experimental point of view",
    "it is still controversial whether the spin transition occurs in the high - pressure or low - pressure structural phase .",
    "we believe that this spread in experimental results reflects the fact that spin transition is a general phenomenon occurring in all relevant structures and with a simple common origin as shown below .",
    "in order to clarify the interplay between spin and structural transitions , we want to identify a few structural indicators that could be used to characterize the hs to ls transition and , as in previous studies,@xcite we will concentrate on the fe coordination sphere .",
    "pressure and/or temperature induced ( anisotropic ) strain causes deformation of the octahedra , which can be quantified by parameters such as the fe  o bond - length distortion , @xmath31 , where d is the average octahedral fe  o bond - length and @xmath32 is the deviation of the _ i - th _ fe  o bond - length from the average , and the octahedral angle variance,@xcite given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the _ j - th _ o  fe  o angle whose ideal value is 90@xmath35 .    in all structures ,",

    "@xmath23 and @xmath36 display very different values for different structures and hence these parameters alone are not suitable as a quantitative fingerprint of the occurrence of the spin transition .",
    "other octahedral structural parameters can be defined such as the maximum ( bl@xmath25 ) and minimum ( bl@xmath26 ) fe  o bond - lengths , the octahedral volume ( v@xmath28 ) and a parameter measuring the nearest - neighbor interaction , defined as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 = 1.3   is of the order of the oxygen ionic radius and @xmath39 s are the fe  o bond lengths . as can be seen in table [ table1 ] , bl@xmath25 , bl@xmath26 and v@xmath28 show jumps to lower values across the transition .",
    "moreover they present very similar values in all structures , both just before but especially just after the transition when the spread of these parameters in different structures is of the order of a few percent .",
    "similarly , the interaction parameter , @xmath27 , also show a jump , this time from a lower to a larger value , again with a spread of a few percent .",
    "it is worth stressing that , in spite of the fact that the hs to ls transition occurs at different pressures in different structures , and the results accumulated contain both gga and gga + @xmath5 calculations , for all the structural parameters considered here , the spread in their calculated values , just before and especially just after the transition , is smaller than the jump they experience across the transition , thus revealing the common mechanism operating in the different structures .",
    "all the above three structural parameters are therefore good indicators that could be used to monitor the approaching of a system to its critical pressure .",
    "o@xmath1-type and _ opv_-type structures at the gga level as well as for corundum - type and rh@xmath0o@xmath1-type structures at the gga+u level . ]",
    "the octahedral volume is possibly the most fundamental one and in fig .",
    "[ vol - collapse ] we report the evolution under pressure of the octahedral volumes of the different structural phases in the hs and ls states .",
    "the data include corundum - type , rh@xmath0o@xmath1(ii)-type and _ opv_-type in the gga scheme and , for corundum - type and rh@xmath0o@xmath1(ii)-type , in the gga+u scheme ( @xmath5=3.3 and 5.6 ev , respectively , as calculated according to ref . ) .",
    "the transition pressures@xcite range from @xmath13 0 gpa to @xmath13 70 gpa and the crystal packing is different for different structures . in spite of all the above differences ,",
    "the hs and ls octahedral volumes follow two well defined equations of state .",
    "the gap between these two equations of state corresponds to the octahedral volume collapse at the transition .",
    "this gap is larger at lower pressures and slowly decreases with pressure .",
    "the finite width of these two equation of states can be attributed to the fact that different structure display different inter - polyhedral surroundings , which are known to play some role in controlling the spin transition,@xcite as well as the fact that the results from different dft scheme ( gga and gga+u ) are collected together .",
    "yet , it is remarkable that the finite width in the equation of states for the octahedral volume is only about 9% for the hs state and just @xmath13 3% in the ls one .    a possible explanation for the larger uncertainty displayed in the hs equation of state lays in the fact that in this state , owing to larger fe  o bonds and angular distortions ( see table [ table1 ] ) , the influence of the surroundings on the octahedra is more significant thus inducing larger spread in the octahedral volume . on the contrary , in the denser ls phase",
    "the octahedra become more regular ( table [ table1 ] ) and the increased fe ",
    "o bond strength , @xmath27 , reduces the relative influence of the surroundings , thus contributing to a smaller spread in the equation of state .",
    "based on the above two regions in fig .",
    "[ vol - collapse ] it might also be possible to estimate the amount of volume collapse or the spin transition pressure at 0k for similar kind of materials , provided any one of the quantities is known .",
    "temperature effects on the transition pressure are however dramatic and are presently beyond our understanding .",
    "given a reliable and consistent structural parameter to characterize the spin transition , let us now turn to an analysis of the main experimental facts involved in its interplay with the structural one .",
    "the co - existence of both low- and high - pressure structural phases over a finite width of pressure / temperature has already been pointed out by a number of studies @xcite .",
    "some controversy still exists @xcite on the nature of the intervening phases .",
    "the resistivity profile in [ ] clearly identifies three pressure regions : a magnetic insulating phase at lower pressure , a nonmagnetic metallic phase at very high pressure and a mixture of them in between .",
    "in particular the nonmagnetic nature of the metallic phase in the intermediate region was assigned on the basis of the assignment of a doublet in the mssbauer spectra as arising from nonmagnetic fe atoms .",
    "we notice however that this assignment is not completely compelling since also a para - magnetic phase , above its ordering transition - temperature , would contribute a doublet in ms",
    ". this interpretation would be consistent with the small energy spread between the different ferromagnetic configurations found in our calculations and reported in the inset of fig .",
    "[ enthalpy - wrt - pbcn - fm - ls ] .",
    "indeed , the x - ray k@xmath40 emission spectra in [ ] showed evidence of ( para-)magnetism , although very weak . this study did not address the conductivity of the various phases .",
    "the picture arising from our calculations agrees with all the experimental evidence and helps clarifying the situation . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ enthalpy - wrt - pbcn - fm - ls ] , the system has three broad regions in terms of magnetic states : a hs region at low pressure ( _ r - i _ ) , a ls , but still ( para-)magnetic , phase at intermediate pressure ( _ r - ii _ ) and a nonmagnetic phase at very high pressure(_r - iii _ ) .",
    "while the hs phase is insulating , both corundum - type and rh@xmath0o@xmath1(ii)-type ls phases as well as the nonmagnetic phases are metallic .",
    "the hs insulating phase is followed by the ls metallic phase in either of the structural phases@xcite , hp1 or hp2 , and we believe it is not constrained by any sharp boundary . in this crossover region , for a finite width on the pressure scale , the hs @xmath41 ls transformation occurs in any particular octahedron depending on the volume that the particular octahedron acquires in that condition .",
    "our explanation for the spin transition goes as follows : for a particular octahedron , the fe  o bond lengths and the octahedral volume decreases gradually with increasing pressure ; at a certain point in the pressure scale , when the minimum fe  o bond length ( see table [ table1 ] ) in that particular octahedron reaches a value for which the octahedral crystal field dominates over the exchange energy , that particular octahedron acquires a new spin state switching from its @xmath42 @xmath43 state to @xmath44 @xmath45 , resulting in the collapse of the octahedral volume .",
    "similar octahedra with equivalent surroundings will experience this transition at the same pressure . while the transition pressure will vary for structures with different crystal packing .",
    "our observation that hs @xmath41 ls transformation depends on a local property , the octahedral volume , is in agreement with and explains the observed sluggishness of the structural transition@xcite .",
    "inhomogeneity in the experimental pressure and temperature fields , the presence of defects and impurities in the experimental samples locally affect the octahedral volume around fe ions and therefore upon increasing pressure the hs to ls transition will occur at different pressures in different octahedra depending on when the critical octahedral volume we have identified is reached . the local volume - collapse associated with spin transition",
    "will contribute to enhance the inhomogeneity of the pressure - field in the sample and the transition will proceed gradually in a nucleation - and - growth way .    in the same pressure range also the structural transition occurs .",
    "minor crystallographic changes , brought about by the alteration of one of the coordinating oxygen atoms , lead to distorted corundum type or rh@xmath0o@xmath1(ii ) type from the corundum type structure .",
    "an important issue is whether spin and structural transitions are strongly inter - dependent or not .",
    "our results indicate that the two type of transitions are not strongly dependent , rather the hs to ls transition is a general phenomenon occurring in all structural phases .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with experimental evidence .",
    "badro _ et . al._@xcite has indeed shown that the spin transition is not necessary for the structural transition to occur , and vice versa .",
    "hence , based on our results and experimental findings , one can qualitatively conclude that the spin and structural transitions are independent phenomena , in the case of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 , at least .    the hs @xmath46 ls and",
    "hp1 @xmath46 hp2 transition are completed by the upper bound of the intermediate region ( _ r - ii _ ) , which then progresses slowly to the nonmagnetic hp2 phase .",
    "our calculated boundary for ls hp2 @xmath46 nonmagnetic hp2 is @xmath13 120 gpa at zero temperature , which is rather far from the room temperature experimental value of @xmath13 72 gpa [ ] . even assuming an , expected , strong temperature effect the discrepancy remains large .",
    "still , accepting the inadequacy of dft in predicting the numerical value of the transition pressures , we stress that dft at the gga level predicts correctly the sequence and details of the transitions . taken together ,",
    "our dft results and the two main experimental works @xcite provide a clearer picture of the pressure evolution of the system across three regions : a hs magnetic phase ( _ r - i _ ) , a ls , but still ( para-)magnetic , phase at intermediate pressure ( _ r - ii _ ) and a nonmagnetic phase at very high pressure(_r - iii _ ) .    to further elucidate the evolution of the system across the spin transition and display the common mechanism that drives it in different crystal structures we present in fig .",

    "<S> analysis of the results on the basis of octahedral volume allows to sum up and bridge the gap between two experimental results and thus provides a better description of the system in the region of interest . </S>"
