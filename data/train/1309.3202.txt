    "in the main text we briefly described an approach to quantum repeaters based on multiplexing in the spectral domain .",
    "we consider quantum memories with pre - set storage times , as discussed in detail in the main text . in this section",
    "we will first describe our architecture in more detail and then describe some of the calculations used to generate fig .",
    "2 in the main text : the average rate of successful entanglement creation across a lossy quantum channel .    in our architecture there exists a lossy quantum channel with length @xmath29 and loss coefficient of @xmath30 .",
    "we split this channel into @xmath31 _ elementary links _ , each of length @xmath32 .",
    "the goal of our architecture is , first , to nearly d    eterministically create entanglement between the ends of each elementary link , which we will refer to as _ elementary - level entanglement _ , and , second , create entanglement between the ends of the entire quantum channel via entanglement swapping between the elementary links .",
    "the number of elementary links @xmath31 is then optimized based on the length and loss of the channel as well as the performance of other elements used in the architecture , such as detectors and quantum memories , to maximize the rate of entanglement creation . to deterministically create elementary entanglement we place a spectrally - multimode quantum memory at each end of the elementary link , as seen in fig",
    ". 1 of the main text . immediately beside each quantum memory",
    "we place a source that generates two - photon entanglement in many spectral modes simultaneously ( i.e. a spectrally - multimode two - photon entanglement source ) .",
    "note that the two - photon entangled state in each mode is independent of all other spectral modes ( e.g. the source may generate the maximally - entangled @xmath33 bell state in each spectral mode : @xmath34 ) and that each source must use the same , pre - agreed upon , set of spectral modes .",
    "one photon from each mode on each side of the elementary link is immediately stored in the quantum memory while the second photon of each pair travels to the centre of the elementary link .    at the centre of the elementary link",
    "is a _ centre station _ that attempts a bell - state measurement ( bsm ) on each spectral mode , using one photon from each source . in general",
    "the bsm is probabilistic due to channel loss , limited detector efficiencies , the use of linear optics for the bsm  @xcite and loss in other optical elements .",
    "however , as photons were emitted in many spectral modes simultaneously , the probability that at least one mode yields a successful bsm can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath35 given a sufficiently large number of spectral modes .",
    "in essence , a successful bsm in spectral mode @xmath36 heralds elementary entanglement in mode @xmath36 between the quantum memories ( multiple simultaneous bsm successes are ignored for simplicity ) .",
    "the centre station sends a classical feed - forward signal informing the quantum memories of the spectral mode in which they now share entanglement .    finally , to establish entanglement between the end points of the entire quantum channel , neighbouring elementary links",
    "must perform entanglement swapping , involving a bsm at the intersection of neighbouring elementary links  where the prime serves to distinguish this bsm from the one performed at the centre station . as neighbouring links likely have elementary entanglement in different spectral modes ,",
    "a frequency conversion is necessary before the entanglement swapping bsm. then , if the intersection of all elementary links successfully performs a bsm ( again probabilistic ) , entanglement is created between the end points of the quantum channel .    the calculation of the average rate of entanglement creation across the quantum channel can be broken down into three parts : the first part is to calculate the probability to create elementary entanglement across all @xmath31 single elementary link , denoted p(elementary ) .",
    "the second part is to calculate the probability to successfully create entanglement across the entire quantum channel , denoted p(success ) , and the third part is to calculate the time between successive attempts , whose inverse gives the rate of entanglement creation , denoted r(success ) . to begin with p(elementary ) , we discuss the case where all sources are probabilistic single - pair entanglement sources ( e.g. a source that with probability @xmath37 emits @xmath35 pair of maximally entangled photons and with probability @xmath38 emits vacuum .",
    "note that if one includes multi - pair emissions typical in entanglement sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion , four - wave mixing , etc .",
    "then one will never create maximally entangled states across the channel . in which case , one must set some kind of tolerance on how much deviation from maximal entanglement is acceptable , such as requiring a fidelity over @xmath39% . the operating conditions of the repeater architecture",
    "could then be optimized to meet this requirement , as done in  @xcite or in  @xcite for the closely related quantum relay .",
    "considering a single elementary link , using only one spectral mode , the probability of a successful bsm at the centre station is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the efficiency of the centre station s detectors , @xmath30 is the loss coefficient of the channel and @xmath42 is the length that each photon must travel .",
    "the square arises as two photons must travel @xmath42 distance each and both must be detected .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that the detectors are noiseless , that the bsm is carried out with linear optics ( i.e. is at most @xmath43% successful and hence the pre - factor of @xmath44 , although in principle this can be made @xmath45% with non - linear optics ) , and that the visibility of the two - photon measurement is perfect .",
    "thus , if each source instead emits @xmath46 spectral modes simultaneously , the probability that all modes result in unsuccessful bsms is given by @xmath47    in general , an extra device to distinguish the different spectral modes ( e.g. wavelength - divsion - multiplexers , highly dispersive media , etc . )",
    "has to be used and will introduce extra loss .",
    "this could be included by appropriately lowering the detection efficiencies or by including another multiplicative term ( within the innermost parentheses ) .",
    "then , the probability that at least one spectral mode results in a successful bsm , which creates the elementary entanglement , is @xmath48 it is clear from eq .",
    "[ eq : mnofail ] that by choosing the number of spectral modes @xmath46 sufficiently high , one can guarantee elementary entanglement with probability approaching one on every attempt .",
    "then , the probability that all @xmath31 elementary links successfully create entanglement is @xmath49    secondly , once all elementary links have established elementary entanglement , entanglement swapping between the links is attempted .",
    "this involves recalling photons from the memories including the frequency shifting and filtering of all but one mode with total efficiency @xmath50 , and a bsm ( @xmath43% efficiency ) with inefficient detectors ( with detection efficiency @xmath51 ) .",
    "note that @xmath50 is defined here as the probability that a photon is stored , is retrieved at the later time and is not lost during frequency shifting and filtering . if there are @xmath31 elementary links there are @xmath52 such entanglement swappings to perform , giving @xmath53    modes , @xmath54% and @xmath55 db / km ) .",
    "each curve is for a different number of elementary links @xmath56 . ]",
    "the entanglement is only useful if it can be recalled from the memories at the ends of the quantum channel and detected , and thus the probability , p(success ) , of generating entanglement across the entire quantum channel is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : pelementary ] @xmath57 or ( with minor simplification ) : @xmath58 here , p(success ) has been grouped into two terms corresponding to , first , the probability to successfully swap entanglement to connect elementary links and , second , p(elementary )  the probability to create entanglement across all elementary links .",
    "it is clear that all the  loss \"  or deviation from deterministic success  is contained within the the first term ( connecting elementary links ) , while the second term is almost independent of loss , provided , again , that @xmath46 is sufficiently high .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ sifig : psuccess ] where we plot p(success ) as a function of distance for @xmath59 and various @xmath31 . at low distance , for all @xmath31 , p(success ) is constant as @xmath46 is high enough to keep the second term close to @xmath35 .",
    "notice that in this flat region , for higher @xmath31 , p(success ) decreases .",
    "this is because using more elementary links requires more memories , detectors and bsms , all with limited efficiency , which decreases the first term of p(success ) .",
    "for each @xmath31 there is a distance where p(success ) drops sharply , which is where the second term begins to significantly drop below @xmath35 ( i.e. @xmath46 is not sufficiently large to ensure elementary entanglement ) .",
    "however , for larger @xmath31 , this sharp decrease occurs at a larger distance .",
    "this is because for larger @xmath31 ( and a given total channel length @xmath29 ) the length of each elementary link is smaller and then p(elementary ) @xmath60 .",
    "thus , at larger distances it becomes advantageous to use more elementary links .     has increased by one , represent ( a ) @xmath2 ( shown in red ) , ( b ) @xmath3 ( shown in green ) and ( c ) @xmath4 ( shown in blue ) spectral modes .",
    "the dotted line represents direct transmission of members of entangled photon pairs produced at @xmath61 ghz . ]",
    "lastly , we calculate the actual rate of entanglement creation r(success ) , which is equal to p(success ) divided by the time between successive attempts . if the quantum memories are limited to storing only one qubit per spectral mode at a time , then the attempt rate would be limited by the communication time across the elementary link ( @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the speed of light ) , as quantum memories can not use their elementary entanglement until they learn the result of the bsm at the centre station .",
    "however , if the quantum memories can store many qubits in each spectral mode simultaneously ( along with @xmath46 spectral modes ) then the attempt rate is limited by the device with the smallest operating bandwidth , assuming that all photons are fourier - transform - limited ( the spectral bandwidth of a device determines the shortest pulse duration the device can handle without loss , which determines the time between successive pulses ) . as optical fibre and other standard optical components already operate over many nanometers , and single - photon detectors with @xmath61  ns recovery time",
    "have been built  @xcite , it is reasonable to assume that quantum memories will be the bandwidth - limiting device . assuming that quantum memories have a total bandwidth of @xmath64 and , again , that @xmath46 spectral modes will be used ( which limits the bandwidth per mode ) and allowing for a bandwidth inefficiency @xmath65 as many implementations will not be able to use the entire memory bandwidth , the time between successive attempts is given by @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , @xmath67    knowing values for all parameters we can calculate the rate of entanglement generation for any distance and any number of elementary links @xmath31 .",
    "we choose the @xmath31 that gives the highest rate and plot the entanglement generation rates in fig .",
    "[ sifig : rsuccess ] ( identical to fig . 2 in the main text ) .",
    "we have performed this optimization for @xmath68 , @xmath69 or @xmath70 spectral modes using @xmath71 ghz ( according to the zero - phonon line of a tm : linbo@xmath0 crystal @xcite ) , @xmath72 , @xmath54% and @xmath55 db / km . in fig .",
    "[ sifig : rsuccess ] we have also included the rate of success for direct transmission assuming a @xmath61 ghz pulsed entanglement source . by direct transmission we specifically envisage placing a source of two - photon entanglement at one end of the quantum channel and then sending one photon from the entangled pair across the quantum channel . if the travelling photon arrives at the other end then entanglement creation has been successful . this probability is simply r(success ) = r(attempt)@xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath74 is reasonable for our implementation , given that afc with rare - earth - ion doped crystals require shelving space ( in the spectral domain ) for ions ( roughly a factor of @xmath75 ) and that time - bin qubits are composed of two temporally - separated pulses ( roughly a factor of @xmath76 ) .",
    "one can see that our architecture scales considerably better than direct transmission even for as little as @xmath77 spectral modes . at shorter distances , when channel loss is minimal",
    ", one sees that the rate of success is optimized with fewer spectral modes , as this allows for a higher attempt rate ( more bandwidth per spectral mode allows for shorter pulses ) .",
    "however , at longer distances , more spectral modes become advantageous .",
    "this is because more spectral modes allows for longer elementary links , which decreases the main source of loss  inefficient entanglement swapping between elementary links .",
    "in fact , the limited success probability for entanglement swapping between elementary links creates exponential scaling in distance for our architecture ( albeit considerably better scaling than direct transmission ) , but this could be avoided with further advances .",
    "for instance , we assumed earlier that if elementary entanglement was established in multiple spectral modes on a single elementary link during an attempt , then only one pair was used for swapping .",
    "if every pair could be used for swapping @xcite then exponential scaling could be avoided if every attempt generated many pairs of elementary entanglement per attempt , which could be achievable by increasing @xmath46 .    for comparison with temporal multiplexing architecture @xcite ,",
    "it is evident that , with ideal resources , temporal multiplexing would perform similar to spectral multiplexing .",
    "this is because given a total available bandwidth @xmath64 one can subdivide it into @xmath46 spectral bins and store @xmath46 spectral modes of duration @xmath78 for spectral multiplexing .",
    "conversely , one may utilize the entire bandwidth to store @xmath46 pulses ( temporal modes ) of duration @xmath79 during the same time @xmath80 for temporal multiplexing ( for simplicity we have ignored the factor @xmath65 , which impacts both protocols similarly ) .",
    "hence , during a set time the two approaches afford the same number of attempts to succeed at entanglement swapping at the elementary link level , and therefore feature comparable performance .",
    "yet , this is not true any more if we take material limitations into account .    for a more realistic comparison ,",
    "let us take into account two key material properties of rare - earth ion doped materials .",
    "the first is the inhomogeneous broadening of the zero - phonon line , which determines the total available bandwidth .",
    "the second is the ground level splitting , which limits the bandwidth of the individual spectral bins .",
    "tm : linbo@xmath0 has a particularly large inhomogeneous broadening of 300 ghz and , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : highfin ] in the supplemental material , we can achieve a splitting of the zeeman ground levels of at least 500 mhz by application of a sufficiently large magnetic field .",
    "this is more than the largest bin width of 300 mhz used in our simulations ( for @xmath77 ) .",
    "hence , the predicted repeater performance in the case of spectral multiplexing is not impeded by the properties of our storage material .",
    "realizing temporal multiplexing with recall on demand in afc memories requires mapping of optically excited coherence onto long lived ground state coherence ( often called spin - wave mapping ",
    "see @xcite for recent progress ) . please recall that the maximal bandwidth of a high - efficiency afc is determined by the ground - level splitting , which is around 10  mhz in the materials used to date to implement the protocol ( much less than 300  ghz , as needed for repeater performance comparable with that derived above for a spectral - multiplexing - based architecture ) .",
    "we point out that the value of 10  mhz is also utilized in @xcite to calculate the average entanglement distribution time for a temporal multiplexing protocol with @xmath77 modes and all other parameters as in our simulations .",
    "the simulations in @xcite show that the temporally multiplexed repeater out - performs a 10  ghz direct transmission protocol at around 510  km fibre length . from fig .",
    "[ sifig : rsuccess ] in our supplemental material ( also fig . 2 in our main text )",
    "it is clear that our proposed architecture outperforms the temporal multiplexing scheme quite convincingly .",
    "each afc , present over the bandwidth of each spectral bin , is comprised of a periodic modulation of the optical depth composing the 795 nm , inhomogeneously broadened @xmath81 absorption line in tm .",
    "it is generated by optically pumping ions to off - resonant nuclear zeeman levels @xcite , and from troughs in the afc to neighbouring peaks ( as we will describe below , this approach limits the efficiency of the afc memory to approximately @xmath82% ) .",
    "optical pumping is achieved by intensity and frequency modulating laser light via an aom and phase modulator , respectively ( refer to fig . 3 in main text ) .",
    "we implement frequency sweeps by driving our phase modulator with sawtooth - shaped ( i.e. serrodyne ) waveforms originating from a 20 gs / s arbitrary waveform generator , and simultaneously drive the aom with a 350 mhz signal when optical pumping is desired .",
    "the memory storage time @xmath83 is set by the afc peak spacing @xmath84 between neighbouring teeth composing the afc . in most experiments ,",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is set to 17 mhz , yielding 60 ns storage time .",
    "the only exception are the measurements leading to the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : highfin ] where @xmath85 mhz , yielding @xmath86 ns .    to create a multi - spectral - binned ( i.e. multimode ) afc , we program the phase modulator to quickly shift the laser frequency to detunings where combs are desired and repeat the afc preparation procedure ( see fig . 4 in the main text for the resultant absorption profile ) .",
    "to achieve greater contrast , and hence more efficient afcs @xcite , the described preparation procedure is repeated 30 times leading to an overall optical pumping duration of 5 ms .",
    "a 2 ms wait time follows the preparation ",
    "it corresponds to 25 times the radiative lifetime of the @xmath87 excited level , and ensures that no luminescence masks the retrieved photons .",
    "although a zero - phonon line of hundreds of ghz is available in ti : tm : linbo@xmath0 @xcite , our multimode afc only takes advantage of approximately 10 ghz .",
    "this bandwidth is set by the sampling rate of our waveform generator and the operating bandwidth of our phase modulator .",
    "referring to fig . 4 in the main text ,",
    "signatures of bandwidth limitations are indicated by the generation of afcs over intervals between desired spectral bins , which is due to higher order frequency modulations , and by reduced afc quality at larger frequency detunings , which is due to reduced energy in the first - order modulation sideband . at the end of each multimode afc preparation sequence",
    "we sweep the laser frequency over a 200 mhz bandwidth around zero detuning .",
    "this results in widening a spectral hole ( from a linewidth of a few mhz to 200 mhz ) that is created during the afc preparation procedure .",
    "this ensures that unmodulated ( i.e. zeroth order ) light accompanying our multimode qubits is not temporally stretched , via interaction with the spectral hole , and produce noise counts that reduce the measured storage and retrieval fidelity of qubits .",
    "the memory efficiency ( i.e. the probability for a photon to be stored and recalled ) is currently approximately @xmath16 .",
    "the efficiency is determined by the transmission , or efficiency , respectively , of each element constituting our quantum memory .",
    "this includes : imperfect optical mode matching between the input and output fibres and the waveguide quantum memory , leading to a fibre - to - fibre transmission of 0.2 ; limited optical depth and afc comb finesse , resulting in a probability for an incoming photon to be absorbed and re - emitted of 0.01 ; 50% insertion loss into our phase modulator ; average efficiency of serrodyne shifting of 0.6 ; imperfect mode matching into and out of the filtering cavity , resulting in additional 75% loss .    to increase the total system efficiency , as required for a practical quantum memory , the following improvements can be made .",
    "first , better optical mode matching at both fibre - to - waveguide interfaces can raise fibre - to - fibre coupling in principle from @xmath88% up to @xmath45% .",
    "alternatively , using bulk rare - earth - ion doped crystals and fibres with gradient - index lenses , transmission can also be raised to near unity .",
    "second , the insertion loss of our phase modulator can be overcome by integrating it with our waveguide ti : tm : linbo@xmath0 crystal .",
    "alternatively , the frequency of the recalled photons can be shifted by means of sum - frequency generation @xcite using a pump beam of variable frequency .",
    "this can in principle be done with 100% conversion efficiency @xcite .",
    "third , higher - bandwidth modulators and driving electronics would allow employing less distorted serrodyne waveforms , resulting in more efficient frequency chirps .",
    "fourth , the filtering cavity needs to be optimized for the particular application ( we used an already existing cavity ) .",
    "finally , in regards to the afc itself , the quantum memory protocol theoretically allows for @xmath89 efficiency @xcite .",
    "improvements from our current 1% rely on increased comb contrast and comb finesse @xmath90 ( where @xmath13 is the teeth spacing and @xmath91 is the linewidth of each tooth @xcite ) , and the preparation of a spatio - spectral grating @xcite or embedding of the rare - earth - ion - doped crystal into an impedance - matched cavity @xcite .",
    "we note that the possibility to increase the finesse , as well as to achieve longer storage times , relies on minimizing the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath91 .",
    "since both are limited by the homogeneous linewidth of tm , this can be achieved by , for example , reduced operating temperatures @xcite .",
    "the afc shown in fig . 4 of the main text is generated by optically pumping atomic population from troughs ( i.e. the regions of transparency between teeth ) into adjacent teeth @xcite . towards this end , we apply a magnetic field along the c@xmath0-axis of tm : linbo@xmath0 .",
    "the ground and excited state of the @xmath81 transition in tm then split into two pairs of nuclear zeeman levels @xcite , which are tuned such that the frequency difference between pairs is @xmath92 .",
    "while this approach maximizes the probability for a photon to be absorbed ( all atoms continue to contribute to the absorption ) , it also results in the creation of an afc with finesse of two . assuming the use of an impedance - matched cavity @xcite , the memory efficiency @xmath93  in the limit of the afc optical depth to finesse ratio being much lower than one  is given by @xmath94 which limits the efficiency for an @xmath95 afc to @xmath82% .",
    "note that this equation assumes each afc tooth has a gaussian shape@xcite , and ignores decay between nuclear zeeman levels ( causing loss ) .",
    "the latter can be approximated when operating at sufficiently low temperatures @xcite .",
    "since improvements in efficiency rely on increased comb finesse @xmath96 , we create and measure a multimode afc having @xmath97 in a separate experiment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : highfin ] ) . towards this end",
    ", we increase the magnetic field to 0.2 tesla , and hence increase the difference in the aforementioned ground and excited - state zeeman splitting to more than the separation between troughs and neighboring peaks .",
    "this allows optical pumping of tm ions out of the bandwidth occupied by an afc , and potentially a larger memory efficiency .",
    "however , as briefly described above , this also results in a reduction of effective optical depth . yet ,",
    "if an impedance - matched cavity is used , according to eq .  [ afc ] , this results in an efficiency of @xmath98 .",
    "multimode time - bin qubits are generated by intensity and frequency modulating laser light using the aforementioned aom and phase modulator .",
    "each qubit consists of one ( early or late ) , or two ( early and late ) , 15 ns - long gaussian - shaped pulses , generated using the aom and separated by 20 ns , with each pulse having a frequency bandwidth matching that of an afc ( i.e. a spectral bin ) .",
    "the fibre frequency of each qubit is defined by driving the phase modulator with a sinusoidal signal , whose frequency ( more precisely : the positive - detuned first order sideband ) defines that of the spectral mode to be occupied by the qubit .",
    "furthermore , the sinusoidal signal s phase can be changed in between the generation of the first and second temporal mode , which allows creating various qubit states .",
    "multimode qubit generation is accomplished by simultaneously driving the phase modulator with many independent sinusoidal signals . to generate the qubits shown in fig . 4 of the main text ,",

    "measuring qubits prepared in @xmath111 or @xmath112 requires detecting photons that have passed through an interferometer .",
    "this measurement as well as steps to stabilize and phase - align the interferometer are discussed next .",
    "first , preceding each measurement , the phase of a fibre - based mach - zehnder interferometer having 4 m path - length difference ( corresponding to 20 ns travel - time difference ) and 98% intrinsic visibility is aligned to allow projection measurements onto @xmath113 . specifically , qubits prepared in @xmath113 , each having mean photon number of 20 , are sent into the interferometer and the resultant interference signal at one particular output of the interferometer is maximized by stretching the fibre in one arm of the interferometer using a piezo actuator . to keep the phase stable , we then send light from our continuous - wave laser into the interferometer , detect the interference signal at the output of the interferometer using a linear photodetector ( shown as d in fig .",
    "3 of the main text ) , and keep the signal constant using feedback to the piezo actuator .",
    "this feedback is applied during each afc preparation sequence , i.e. for 2 ms every 12 ms , which is sufficient to avoid thermal drifts . the interferometer stabilization setup is indicated by  to ( from ) mzi lock setup  in fig .",

    ", the measurement sequence begins by reducing the mean photon number per qubit to the single - photon level ( either 0.5 , 0.1 , or zero photons per qubit ) , creating and storing photons in the desired quantum states ( either @xmath111 or @xmath112 ) , recalling photons from the afc memory , and subsequently projecting them onto @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the latter corresponds to detections in the interferometer output mentioned above , or detections in this output after having introduced an additional @xmath114 phase shift using the interferometer s piezo actuator .",
    "finally , we note that frequency shifting of time - bin qubits by an amount @xmath115 comes along with a modification of the phase @xmath116 that determines the superposition of early and late temporal modes : @xmath117 , where @xmath118 denotes the difference between early and late .",
    "we use the phase modulator that preceds the filtering cavity to both frequency shift and correct any phase shifts introduced when recalling qubits .",
    "decoy state analysis allows implementing quantum key distribution protocols using phase - randomized attenuated laser pulses without compromising the protocol s security due to photon number splitting attacks @xcite .",
    "it ensures that the final key stems only from attenuated laser pulses containing one photon .",
    "the application of this analysis can be further generalized to allow any experiment performed with weak coherent states , such as attenuated laser pulses , to mimic an experiment using a much more elaborate setup that incorporates single photon ( fock ) states . for the purpose of proving the quantum nature of e.g. memories , as in our experiment",
    ", the decoy state analysis provides an avenue for simpler experimental demonstrations of complex protocols .",

    "_ @xcite .    in order to show the quantum nature of our spectrally multimode memory",
    ", we must verify that the fidelity of the recalled state with the input state is higher than the classical bound of 2/3 @xcite .",
    "however , this bound is only valid when using genuine qubits , i.e. for quantum states encoded into single photons . when using attenuated laser pulses , the classical bound has to be increased to account for the statistical distribution of the number of photons in a pulse and is also impacted by the memory efficiency @xcite . to be able to apply the 2/3 classical bound",
    ", we use a decoy state method to find a lower bound for the fidelity for the single photon component of the attenuated laser pulse .",
    "the derivation assumes a poissonian photon number distribution in the light such as in the attenuated laser pulses at our memory s input .",
    "furthermore , the pulses need to be phase randomized , which results in a states described by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the poissonian distribution and @xmath121 denotes an n - photon fock state .    as a first step",

    "<S> future multi - photon applications of quantum optics and quantum information science require quantum memories that simultaneously store many photon states , each encoded into a different optical mode , and enable one to select the mapping between any input and a specific retrieved mode during storage . here </S>",

    "<S> rely on joint measurements of multiple photons that encode quantum states ( e.g. qubits ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , as photons generally arrive in a probabilistic fashion , either due to a probabilistic creation process or due to loss during transmission , such measurements are inherently inefficient . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , this leads to exponential scaling of the time required to establish entanglement , the very resource of quantum information processing , as a function of distance in a quantum relay @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this problem can be overcome by using quantum memories , which are generally realized through the reversible mapping of quantum states between light and matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for efficient operation , these memories must be able to simultaneously store many photon states , each encoded into a different optical mode , and subsequently ( using feed - forward ) allow selecting the mapping between input and retrieved modes ( e.g. , different spectral or temporal modes ) . </S>",
    "<S> this enables making several photons arriving at a measurement device indistinguishable , thereby rendering joint measurements deterministic . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , revisiting the example of entanglement distribution , a quantum relay supplemented with quantum memories changes it to a repeater and , in principle , the scaling from exponential to polynomial @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for such multimode quantum memories to be useful , it is not necessary to map any input mode onto any retrieved ( output ) mode , but it often suffices if a single input mode , chosen once a photon is stored , can be mapped onto a specific output mode ( e.g. characterized by the photon s spectrum and recall time ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures that the photons partaking in a joint measurement , each recalled from a different quantum memory , are indistinguishable , as required , e.g. , for a bell - state measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that it does not matter if the device used to store quantum states also allows the mode mapping , or if the mode mapping is performed after recall using appended devices  we will refer to the system allowing storage and mode mapping as _ the memory_.    to date , most research assumes photons arriving at different times at the memory ( i.e. temporal multiplexing ) , and recall on demand in terms of variable storage time @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we show , with the example of a quantum repeater , that it is also possible to employ spectrally - multiplexed states and storage devices with fixed storage times , supplemented with frequency shifts based on feed - forward control . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we report measurements using a highly broadband solid - state memory @xcite that demonstrate the required mapping between input and output modes with time - bin qubits encoded into up to 26 spectral modes and a fidelity of 0.97 , thereby significantly violating the classical bound of 2/3 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that for applications requiring short storage times , such as in linear optics quantum computing , a low - loss fibre could be sufficient to delay photons until a feed - forward signal arrives . </S>",
    "<S> however , for applications , such as a quantum repeater , in which storage times exceed around 10 @xmath1s , fibre transmission drops below 90% and hence quantum state storage based on light - matter interaction will be necessary . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , light - matter interaction affords more flexibility to perform processing tasks other than delaying @xcite .    much theoretical and experimental work aiming at the development of quantum memory </S>",
    "<S> has been reported over the past decade @xcite , and most criteria required for such a memory to be suitable for the aforementioned applications have been independently met . however , at most two ( entangled ) qubits have been stored simultaneously in a way that allowed selecting the mode mapping @xcite , and the scalability of the approach , which relied on encoding information into four spatial modes , to tens or hundreds of qubits and modes remains to be proven ( we note related work by lan et al . </S>",

    "<S> however , choosing the time of recall using control lasers to perform the mode mapping in the storage device is challenging with an afc memory @xcite .        drawing from the well - known temporal multiplexing approach , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : repeater ] shows , with the example of a quantum repeater , how spectrally multimode quantum memories , including frequency shifters and filters , allow rendering photons indistinguishable without the need for a variable storage time . while a repeater that employs temporal multiplexing assumes all qubits to feature the same spectrum but to arrive at different times at the memory , our new approach assumes all qubits to arrive at the same time , but to feature distinct spectra ( i.e. to be encoded into different frequency bins ) . </S>",
    "<S> the retrieval of a desired qubit at a given time and with a given spectrum can then be achieved by retrieving all qubits after the same storage time , selecting the shift of the spectra of all qubits such that the desired qubit occupies a previously agreed - upon frequency bin , and rejecting all other qubits using a filtering cavity . to quantify the performance of a quantum repeater based on spectral multiplexing </S>",
