    "the behaviour of solar non - axisymmetric activity has been studied since the beginning of the last century @xcite .",
    "it has been recognised that the distribution of sunspot groups is not uniform , they tend to cluster to a certain heliographic longitude @xcite .",
    "these early studies of the active longitudes focused mainly on the distribution of sunspot groups or sunspot relative numbers . from the middle of the 20th century it has been suggested that not just the sunspot groups have a non - homogeneous longitudinal distribution . this inhomogeneity has been found in the case of solar flares @xcite , surface magnetic fields @xcite , heliospheric magnetic field @xcite and , recently , active longitudes have been observed in coronal streamers @xcite .",
    "macrospicules ( hereinafter : ms ) are chromospheric objects observed in h@xmath2 and he @xmath3 nm @xcite .",
    "they are explosive jet - like features extending up to , on average , @xmath4 mm and velocities up to approximately @xmath5 km / s @xcite .",
    "their structure reflects the solar atmosphere they move through , they are proposed to have a cool core , surrounded by a hot sheath @xcite .",
    "they are of particular use in this study , as they are observed from the solar equator to the poles .    in this paper",
    "we study the longitudinal and latitudinal spatial distributions of ms .",
    "furthermore , we will explore the relationship between the sunspot groups , non - axisymmetric behaviour or active longitude ( hereinafter : al ) and longitudinal distributions of ms .",
    "the ms were observed using the @xmath3 nm spectral window aia on - board sdo ( solar dynamic observatory ) @xcite .",
    "this takes a @xmath6 pixel , full disc , image of the sun at a cadence of @xmath7 s. we took typical samples of two hours , twice a month , from june @xmath0 until december @xmath1 . for each image the solar limb was flattened out , making it easier to identify and measure the ms .",
    "they are extremely difficult to measure on disk and as such this study concentrates on those occuring at the limb .",
    "we record the time at the moment they become visible at the limb and their angular displacement from solar due east .",
    "measuring ms this way we identified 101 examples of ms .",
    "the physical dimensions and the heliographic coordinates have been estimated .",
    "the source of sunspot data that we use to calculate the most enhanced longitude of sunspot groups ( al ) is the debrecen photoheliographic data ( dpd ) sunspot catalogue @xcite .",
    "this database is the continuation of the classic greenwich photoheliographic results ( gpr ) , the source of numerous works in this field .",
    "the sunspot catalogue has been used , providing a time sample from @xmath8 .",
    "this data sample contains information about area and position for every sunspot .",
    "to study the latitudinal spatial behaviour of ms as a first step , we determine the heliographical latitudes ( b ) .",
    "for further analysis , the carrington latitudes , @xmath9 , have been transformed , into the following system :    @xmath10    the domain of interest of the quantity @xmath11 is @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath13 point contains the northern and southern poles .",
    "the @xmath14 $ ] sub - domain of @xmath11 represents the northern hemisphere , the ascending @xmath11 values from @xmath15 to @xmath16 show the descending latitudes from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the southern hemispheres have been considered in the same way .",
    "figure  [ ms_dis ] shows the result of the statistics above .",
    "the histogram depicts a normal distribution .",
    "the mean of the distribution is @xmath19 , suggesting that most of the ms tend to cluster to the poles .",
    "we also found that the northern hemisphere was a slightly more active in this time period .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath20 and @xmath21 . hence , @xmath22 of the data tend to cluster in a @xmath23 wide belt from the poles .",
    "that is to say : @xmath22 of ms are between the @xmath24 and @xmath25 heliographic latitude , and , @xmath26 of ms are in a @xmath27 degrees belt from the poles or between the @xmath28 and @xmath25 in heliographic latitude",
    ". therefore , ms are able to exercise longitudinal inhomogeneity at higher latitudes .    .",
    "the solid black line is the fitted gaussian distribution .",

    "to @xmath31 based on sunspot groups .",
    "the left panel sows the northern hemisphere .",
    "the right panel is the southern hemisphere.,width=483 ]    according to our previous study @xcite the active longitudes identification method have been considered and the active longitude was found to be distinct in each hemisphere .",
    "the present investigation started with a similar method as described in our preceding paper @xcite .",
    "the areas and positions of all sunspot groups are considered .",
    "the solar surface is divided into longitudinal bins of @xmath32 and the areas of all groups were summed up in each bin : @xmath33 in certain carrington rotation ( cr ) between @xmath34 and @xmath31 , which is the time interval of the ms sample .",
    "next , the longitudinal activity concentration is represented by the quantity @xmath35 defined by ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the number of bins , @xmath38 is the sum of all sunspot groups in a given cr and @xmath39 is the total area of sunspot groups in a cr and at a specific longitudinal bin .    in each cr",
    "we omitted all of the @xmath40 values which are lower than the @xmath41 significance limit .",
    "the highest peak , @xmath42 , has been selected from this decayed sample ( which contains only the significant peaks ) caused by the significance test .",
    "for further analysis , the carrington longitudes , @xmath43 , will now be transformed , into carrington phase period :    @xmath44    hence , the values of the phases are always smaller or equal ( which is the entire circumference ) than one .",
    "the time - variation of the parameter @xmath42 is plotted in figure  [ al ] .",
    "the vertical axis is the phase parameter , which has been repeated by @xmath45 times .",
    "the northern ( left - hand - side ) and the southern ( right - hand - side ) cases are considered separately .",
    "both figures unveil a clear increasing migration pattern .",
    "@xcite found similar patterns at a different time interval .",
    "most of the migration follows a parabola shape ( which has been fitted by the least - square method ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    the parameter @xmath46 is now introduced to study the relationship between the active longitude @xmath42 defined by sunspot groups , and the longitudinal position of ms @xmath47 in cr .",
    "@xmath48    the parameter @xmath46 has been reduced by a unit phase if it is larger than @xmath49 , which means this quantity represents the shortest phase difference between the longitudinal position of a given ms and the position of active longitudes in both hemispheres . for further analysis ,",
    "the @xmath46 samples of the northern and southern hemispheres are now combined .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of the quantity @xmath46 is shown in figure  [ stat ] . on the @xmath50-axis the meaning of the lower values reflect on the smallest longitudinal difference in phase",
    ", the value @xmath49 phase jumps to the opposite side of the sun .",
    "the ms tend to cluster near the active longitudes , which is shown by the first and second peaks : @xmath51 ) 61 % of the candidates .",
    "however , there is a significant peak around @xmath49 , which is the signature of the appearance of secondary longitudinal belts .",
    "the secondary belt exists always at the same time as the primary .",
    "note that the latter is always stronger than the secondary belt , and the phase shift is around @xmath49 .",
    "the ms show a similar behaviour .",
    "a secondary belt appears for the @xmath52 of the events and @xmath53 ) .",
    "we investigated the distribution of macrospicules detected at the solar surface as function of their longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates in carrington coordinates .",
    "a non - homogeneous latitudinal macrospicule distribution has been found .",
    "most of the events tend to cluster to the higher latitudes ( @xmath26 of ms are with in the @xmath28 to @xmath25 heliographical latitude ) .",
    "the number of the events is found to be growing exponentially from the equator to the pole in both hemispheres .",
    "a slightly asymmetrical behaviour has been found between the two hemispheres in the studied time interval , where the northern hemisphere was marginally more active than the southern . in the studied time period",
    "other phenomena show northern - southern asymmetry .",
    "the northern hemisphere was significantly more active in terms of the averaged maximum sunspot area ( northern hemisphere : 203 , southern hemisphere : 183 ) and the international sunspot number ( northern hemisphere : 29 , southern hemisphere : 18 ) .",
    "for that reason we assume the location of the ms might be connected to the solar dynamo processes , however , caution must be exercised as this conclusion is based on a rather limited statistical sample .",
    "the longitudinal spatial distribution of ms is not uniform either .",
    "a large proportion of the ms ( 83 of from the 101 in our sample ) tend to cluster to the al . in the case of the primary active longitude belt ,",
    "the macrospicules are within @xmath54 degrees of the active longitude .",
    "the secondly belt has a @xmath55 wide range where the macrospicule are found to be concentrated .",
    "this supports the existence of an active longitude at higher latitudes .",
    "ms instances extend up to 50 mm in the solar atmosphere .",
    "therefore , they have been proposed as a viable candidate for solar wind acceleration and coronal heating , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the origin of such ms is either due to wave modes ( e.g. , @xcite ) or by magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "however , how these triggering mechanisms of ms are related with magnetic flux transport processes is not yet known .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the evolution of a small - scale bipolar flux tube in quiet - sun and its internal reconnection to produce ms .",
    "this provides some clues on the connection of localised generation of macrospicule with small - scale magnetic field evolution",
    ". however , more statistics in terms of the observations and stringent modelling are needed to explore this aspect of ms origin .    the temporal variation of the number of ms has been investigated , but the correlation between the temporal density of ms and the increasing trend of solar cycle 25 has not yet been found .",
    "a reason for the lack of finding such correlation could be the limited time period and sample size of the data investigated .    a large sample and more comprehensive statistical study is now in preparation for a more detailed search for further identifiable non - homogenous longitudinal distributions of ms in the entire time period covered by observations of the sdo satellite .",
