    "it is well known that malliavin calculus is a tool which allows , among other , to prove that the law of a diffusion process admits a  smooth density .",
    "more precisely , if one assumes that the coefficients of an sde are bounded @xmath1 functions with bounded derivatives of any order and that , on the other hand , the hormandr condition holds , then the solution of the equation is a smooth functional in malliavin s sense , and it is nondegenerate at any fixed positive time",
    ". then the general criterion given by malliavin @xcite allows one to say that the law of such a random variable is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , and its density is a smooth function ( see @xcite for a general presentation of this topic ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to relax the aforementioned conditions on the coefficients : roughly speaking , we assume that the coefficients are smooth only on an open domain @xmath0 and have bounded partial derivatives therein .",
    "moreover , we assume that the nondegeneracy condition on the diffusion coefficient holds true on @xmath0 only . under these assumptions",
    ", we prove that the law of a strong solution to the equation admits a smooth density on @xmath0 ( theorem [ t : localdens1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath0 is the complementary of a compact ball and the coefficients satisfy some additional assumptions on @xmath0 ( mainly dealing with their growth and the one of derivatives ) , we give upper bounds for the density for large values of the state variable ( theorem  [ t : localdenssublin1 ] ) .",
    "we will occasionally refer to these aymptotic estimates of the density as `` tail estimates '' or estimates on the density s `` tails . ''",
    "local results have already been obtained by kusuoka and stroock in @xcite , section 4 . here",
    "the authors work under local regularity and nondegeneracy hypotheses too , but the bounds they provide on the density are mostly significant on the diagonal ( i.e. , close to starting point ) and in the small time limit , while they are not appropriate for tail estimates . moreover , the constants appearing in the estimates are not explicit ( cf .",
    "( 4.7)(4.9 ) in theorem  4.5 and the corresponding estimates in corollary 4.10 , @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    ", we provide upper bounds that are suitable for tail estimates , and we find out the explicit dependence of the bounding constants with respect to the coefficients of the sde and their derivatives .",
    "our bounds turn out to be applicable to the case of diffusions with tails stronger than gaussian .",
    "this is the case for square - root diffusions , which are our major example of interest ( see section [ s : localcir ] ) .",
    "also , our approach is substantially different from the one in @xcite . in particular",
    ", we rely on a fourier transform argument , employing a technique to estimate the fourier transform of the process inspired from the work of fournier in @xcite and of bally in @xcite and relying on specifically - designed malliavin calculus techniques .",
    "we estimate the density @xmath2 of the diffusion at a point @xmath3 performing an integration by parts that involves the contribution of the brownian noise only on an arbitrarily small time interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "this allows us to gain a free parameter @xmath5 that we can eventually optimize , and the appropriate choice of @xmath5 proves to be a key point in our argument .",
    "we do not study here the regularity with respect to initial condition ( which may be the subject of future work ) .",
    "our study is motivated by applications to finance , in particular by the study of models for financial securities which rely on sdes with non - lipschitz coefficients .",
    "as it is well known , a celebrated process with square - root diffusion coefficient was proposed by cox , ingersoll and ross in @xcite as a model for short interest rates and was later employed by heston in @xcite to model the stochastic volatilities of assets .",
    "the stochastic-@xmath6 or sabr model in @xcite is based on the following mixing of local and stochastic volatility dynamics : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is a standard brownian motion , and @xmath11 $ ] is the correlation parameter . in this paper",
    ", we apply our results to one - dimensional sdes of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are @xmath17 functions . when the coefficients  @xmath14 , @xmath18 are constant , the solutions to this class of equations include the classical cir process ( @xmath19 ) and a subclass of the cev local volatility diffusions ( when @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "as pointed out by bossy and diop in @xcite , sdes with square - root terms and coefficients depending on the level of the state variable arise as well in the modeling of turbulent flows in fluid mechanics .",
    "it is well known that for a  cir process , the density of @xmath22 is known explicitly .",
    "the main contribution of our results lies in the fact that they apply to the more general framework of sdes whose coefficients are functions of the state variable , thus when explicit computations are no longer possible .",
    "theorem  [ t : localdenssublin1 ] directly applies to ( [ e : localcir1 ] ) and allows one to show that  @xmath22 admits a smooth density on @xmath23 : under some additional conditions on the coefficients ( mainly dealing with their asymptotic behavior at @xmath24 and zero ) , we give exponential - type upper bounds for the density at infinity ( proposition  [ p : asinfty ] ) and study the explosive behavior of the density at zero ( proposition  [ p : aszero ] ) . the explicit expression of the density for the classical cir process shows that our estimates are in the good range .",
    "the paper is organized follows : in section [ s : generalsmooth ] we present our main results on sdes with locally smooth coefficients ( section [ s : mainresults ] ) , and we collect all the technical elements we need to give their proofs .",
    "in particular , in section [ s : mc ] we recall the basic tools of malliavin calculus on the wiener space , which will be used in section [ s : techpart ] to obtain some explicit estimates of the @xmath25-norms of the weights involved in the integration by parts formula .",
    "this is done following some standard techniques of estimation of sobolev norms and inverse moments of the determinant of the malliavin matrix ( as in @xcite and @xcite , section 4 ) , but in our computations we explicitly pop out the dependence with respect to the coefficients of the sde and their derivatives .",
    "this further allows us to obtain the explicit asymptotic estimates on the density .",
    "section [ s : proofs ] is devoted to the proof of the theorems stated in section  [ s : mainresults ] .",
    "we employ the fourier transform argument and the optimized integration by parts we have discussed above .",
    "finally , in section [ s : localcir ] we apply our results to the solutions of ( [ e : localcir1 ] ) .",
