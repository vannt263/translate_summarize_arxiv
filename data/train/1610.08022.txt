    "frictionless flow is one of the most spectacular manifestation of quantum coherence in many - body systems at the macroscopic scale .",
    "historically , its appearance in fermion matter has been first evidenced in superconducting ( sc ) metals , nuclei and superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "actually , cooper pair condensates keep on attracting interest , especially because of the diversity of observed ground - states . for a large class of sc materials ,",
    "ranging from elements ( such as hg @xcite ) to alloys ( such as nb@xmath1ge @xcite ) , and possibly to the newly discovered high - t@xmath2 hydrogen sulfide under pressure @xcite , the pair wavefunction exhibits s - wave symmetry .",
    "the microscopic mechanism for electron pairing is then well established and invokes a phonon mediated attraction according to bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) and eliashberg theories .",
    "however , condensed matter physics also harbors an ever increasing family of superconductors that challenges this conventional paradigm .",
    "this applies in particular to heavy fermion systems , where the formation of local cooper pairs is suppressed by the coulomb interaction . as reviewed by , e.g. , thalmeier et al .",
    "@xcite this leads to a wealth of behaviors .",
    "for example , sc pairing due to magnetic excitons has been observed in upd@xmath3al@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , comprehensive experimental work demonstrated that in several ce - based systems , including cecu@xmath3si@xmath3 , sc tends to mostly appear in the vicinity of a quantum critical point @xcite , thereby providing strong evidence of the interplay between magnetic and pairing degrees of freedom .",
    "strong correlation is also a hallmark of the superconducting cuprates , where numerous experiments point towards an sc order parameter with d - wave symmetry .",
    "furthermore , it has long been suspected on theoretical grounds , that unconventional sc pairing mechanism involving momentum - carrying cooper pairs is favored in striped phases @xcite .",
    "the recent observation of pair density waves in bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite came to support this scenario , that strongly suggests an intertwining of the spin , charge , and pair degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "more generally , the sc correlations in cuprates develop from a bad metal normal phase and in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic order .",
    "a similar feature is in fact shared by other classes of high - t@xmath2 sc compounds , such as iron pnictides and chalcogenides @xcite .",
    "these materials are nevertheless singular by exhibiting multi - band fermi surfaces that lead to a non - universal and still under debate sc order parameter where extended s - wave and d - wave pairing symmetries are close competitors . finally , ruthenate superconductors currently attract a particular attention due to a spin - triplet p - wave pair condensation , possibly induced by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "in addition , a variety of experiments point toward a chiral sc order parameter that could support non - abelian excitations .",
    "understanding most of the above mentioned strongly correlated sc systems obviously requires going beyond the standard bcs mean - field approximation that assumes independent bogoliubov quasiparticles . for lattice electron models , such as the single- or multi - band hubbard hamiltonians ,",
    "gutzwiller - bcs wavefunctions are thus frequently used as trial states . in this case ,",
    "strong electronic correlations are included by partially or totally suppressing double occupancy entailed from a bcs ansatz with an assumed internal structure of the fermion pairs @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the variational optimization of large coherent superpositions of general bcs states , free of any a priori input on the relevant correlations , have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "however , quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) methods remain indubitably the most powerful approaches to solve the schrdinger equation in many - body systems .",
    "the acronym qmc actually embraces a multitude of stochastic algorithms , but the general strategy is to represent the zero- or finite - temperature equilibrium state as an integral in a high dimensional space that can be evaluated using random walks .",
    "a compelling example is the auxiliary - field qmc approach that performs projection on exact ground - states by sampling fictitious systems of independent particles in external fluctuating fields .",
    "the half - filled hubbard model on bipartite lattices has been extensively investigated through such techniques@xcite .",
    "for instance , the mott metal - to - insulator transition on the honeycomb lattice was recently addressed on clusters which size exceeds 2000 sites @xcite .",
    "another clarified issue is the entanglement of mott insulators through the determination of the renyi entropies @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the general applicability of fermionic qmc schemes suffer from the emergence of negative  weight  or even complex contributions , that deteriorate the stochastic reconstruction of the exact wavefunction to a point where the signal - to - noise ratio becomes almost zero .",
    "this infamous sign or phase problem has been proven to be np - hard and its algorithmic solution with polynomial - time complexity probably does not exist @xcite . for qmc methods in the configuration space @xcite and time - invariant hamiltonians , a solution could be found in principle by preventing the random - walk to move across a node of the exact ground - state . in practice ,",
    "the nodal surface is imposed from a trial wavefunction and calculations become variational . with auxiliary - field qmc approaches ,",
    "sufficient conditions for the absence of sign / phase problems are known @xcite .",
    "otherwise , restricted - path approximations have been developed for lattice models with hubbard - like hamiltonians that also ensure a sampling of real slater determinants @xcite .",
    "similar restricted - path approximations have been developed for lattice models with hubbard - like hamiltonians through a stochastic exploration of real slater determinants by the auxiliary - field qmc approach .",
    "the so - called phaseless qmc scheme developed by zhang and krakauer @xcite finally provides the most general framework to obtain an approximate ground - state of any fermion system defined either by a model or by a realistic hamiltonian including two - body interactions . in the original formulation ,",
    "the method relies on a random walk within independent particle states that is guided and constrained to control phase problems thanks to a trial many - body wavefunction . up to now ,",
    "single- or multi - determinant states have been used for this purpose . here",
    ", we propose an extension better suited for superconductors through bcs wavefunctions not only as trial states , but also as walkers to absorb in a single path fermion pair condensation .",
    "we first review in section  [ sec : hfb ] the basic properties of the most general pair coherent states , known as hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) wavefunctions and for which relevant cooper pairs do not need to be assumed .",
    "the imaginary - time many - body schrdinger equation is then reformulated in section  [ sec : sto ] as the average of stochastic trajectories of such hfb states .",
    "the restricted - paths approximations required to obtain a viable qmc scheme , i.e. free of phase problems and with an ensured finite variance sampling , are presented in section  [ sec : variance ] .",
    "the estimation of ground - state observables is discussed in section  [ sec : estobs ] by extending the usual wick s theorem to matrix elements between hfb states .",
    "section  [ sec : numex ] aims at illustrating the approach and provides a first numerical implementation for a spin polarized fermi system in the strongly attractive regime .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions and perspectives .    all along this work",

    "the associated hamiltonian will therefore be given , in second quantization , by    @xmath5    @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the usual creation and annihilation fermionic operators in a state @xmath8 belonging to an orthonormal basis in the one - body space @xmath9 , which is supposed to be of finite size .",

    "contrary to real space qmc methods , simulations can be performed by choosing any single particle basis .",
    "any physical quantity can also be estimated by applying an extension of the wick s theorem that we have formulated in terms of pfaffians to avoid the combinatorial complexity of standard expansions in products of binary contractions .    in condensed matter physics , we expect our framework to help shedding new light on the microscopic mechanisms leading to the formation of unconventional cooper pairs , such as the ones realized in the superconducting cuprates and heavy fermion materials .",
    "besides , the phaseless qmc approach with stochastic hfb wavefunctions could unravel the degree of intertwining of order parameters as arising in systems exhibiting long wave - length modes .",
    "another field of application lies in synthetic quantum matter with ultracold atoms that can emulate attractive fermi systems .",
    "in particular , the formalism is well suited to the investigation of rotating superfluid fermi gases in the strongly interacting regime .",
    "exotic pairing modes induced by artificial spin - orbit couplings or in multicomponent gases could be addressed too .",
