    "the tail behavior of products of powers of heavy - tailed positive random variables is of crucial importance in many applications , particularly in finance , but e.g.  in network modeling too . in stochastic volatility time series",
    ", the log - volatilities are usually modelled as linear time series @xmath5 if the innovations @xmath6 have an exponential or gamma type tail , then the volatility @xmath7 at time @xmath8 is a product of powers of the regularly varying random variables @xmath9 , with exponents depending on @xmath8 . to assess the risk of a volatile market at different time points @xmath10 , one thus has to analyze probabilities of the type @xmath11 for suitable exponents @xmath12 . using a new breiman type result , it was shown in @xcite that these probabilities also determine the risk of jointly large losses over different periods .    similarly , in a credit risk model for @xmath0 risks with @xmath13 independent factors",
    "@xmath14 , the @xmath15-th risk is often modeled as a multiple of @xmath16 with @xmath17 denoting the idiosyncratic part ( cf .",
    "if the @xmath18 and @xmath17 have an exponential or gamma type tail , the analysis of the joint tail risk again leads to probabilities of the above type .    in network modeling ,",
    "both transmission durations @xmath19 and rates @xmath20 arising from one source may be modeled by regularly varying random variables with different indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the total volume of traffic from one source",
    "can then be expressed as @xmath23 for random variables @xmath24 which are regularly varying with index @xmath25 . if one wants to determine the probability that different sources contribute large volumes in the same period , then again probabilities of the above type arise .",
    "moreover , one may introduce dependencies between @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the same or for different sources by modeling them as products of ( partially ) identical factors with different exponents .    as the example of log - volatilities demonstrates ,",
    "the analysis of the joint tail behavior of power products is equivalent to the corresponding analysis for linear combinations of random variables with exponential type tails such that exponentials of these random variables are regularly varying .",
    "hence the results given below allow a tail analysis in such settings too .",
    "motivated by these examples , we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the probability of joint exceedances of power products , i.e. of @xmath28 where @xmath29 are independent , non - negative regularly varying random variables and @xmath12 are coefficients which may be negative .",
    "we restrict the analysis to the case of a finite number @xmath30 of factors , but extensions to an infinite number of factors , using a breiman - type argument , are possible . in @xcite ,",
    "such probabilities were investigated under the restrictive assumption that no coefficient is negative .",
    "it was shown there , that the probabilities behaved asymptotically like a multiple of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the solution to a linear program determined by the matrix @xmath4 .",
    "while the restriction to positive coefficients @xmath12 seems acceptable e.g.  for multi - factor models , it is quite severe for log - volatility time series .",
    "moreover , essentially only the case @xmath33 was considered in @xcite and the techniques employed do not easily generalize to higher dimensions , which limits the applicability of the established results further .    using a recently introduced abstract concept of regular variation on cones based on the notion of @xmath34-convergence ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , we can avoid all these drawbacks .",
    "to this end , we first introduce a non - standard form of regular variation on the cone @xmath35 for the random vector @xmath36 , from which one may conclude the asymptotics of probabilities of the type @xmath37 for suitable coefficients @xmath38 and sets @xmath39 that are bounded away from the boundary of the cone .",
    "unfortunately , in general the sets @xmath40 pertaining to the probabilities are not of this type .",
    "hence , quite involved arguments are needed to prove that the parts of @xmath41 close to the boundary of the cone are asymptotically negligible . to this end ,",
    "auxiliary results are proved in section [ sec : auxresults ] which are of interest on their own . in particular , proposition [ lem : momentsconverge ] can be seen as a multivariate version of the direct half of karamata s theorem , cf .",
