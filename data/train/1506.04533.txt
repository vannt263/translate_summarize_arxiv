    "the distinctive electronic properties of monolayer graphene can be modified by stacking more graphene layers on top @xcite .",
    "for instance , bernal ( also called ab - stacked ) bilayer graphene ( blg ) shows a parabolic dispersion relation at low energies , and a gap can be opened by the external electric field applied perpendicular to the system @xcite .",
    "although the experimentally obtained energy gaps are moderate , such a gap opening is impossible in monolayer graphene or bilayer graphene with other stackings , so it is of great importance for making electronic devices based on graphene .",
    "interestingly , experimental results indicate that the transport gap in bernal - stacked blg is smaller than the optical one @xcite .",
    "there is a substantial dispersion of the gap values , depending on whether the sample is suspended or not , and in the latter case , the type of substrate employed .",
    "in fact , even for zero bias some samples showed a transport gap @xcite , while others presented a metallic behavior @xcite .",
    "many - body effects have been invoked to explain such differences @xcite ; however , another plausible explanation has arisen recently , namely , the existence of stacking boundaries in bilayer graphene .    in monolayer graphene , domain walls can be atomically sharp , consisting on grain boundaries made of topological defects with associated edge states @xcite .",
    "these grain boundaries have been extensively studied in multilayer graphene @xcite and even in carbon nanotubes @xcite . in blg , boundaries composed of topological defects also occur @xcite , but domain walls can as well consist of a stacking dislocation between ab and ba regions ( equivalent to the so - called ab - ac boundaries ) .",
    "such structures have been experimentally identified by various techniques , evidencing their ubiquity in bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "in contrast to boundaries made of topological defects , stacking boundaries are not atomically sharp .",
    "they can appear as strained regions , which produce a gradual transition between ab and ba - stacked graphene .",
    "the connection between the two stacking regions can take place in different forms : not only by tensile or shear strain , but also by corrugations of one of the layers @xcite .",
    "the reversal of stackings has significant influence on the electronic transport , it lowers the conductance between the ab and ba regions and leads to the appearance of the topologically protected states localized in the transition region .",
    "indeed , gapped bilayer graphene has been recently predicted to be a quantum valley hall insulator @xcite .",
    "it can have chiral edge states associated to the two valleys propagating in opposite directions , which are topologically protected if valley mixing is precluded .",
    "these robust states were predicted to appear in electric - field domain walls @xcite , where two regions differ in the sign of the applied voltage ; however , these systems are not easy to implement experimentally .",
    "in fact , they are equivalent to an ab / ba stacking boundary , as those produced in strained bilayer graphene with a uniform applied voltage , which also show these robust gapless states @xcite . stacking boundaries",
    "have been experimentally observed @xcite and there is recent evidence of the existence of topologically protected states in them @xcite .",
    "ripples or corrugations in single layer graphene were theoretically predicted to appear as a consequence of thermal fluctuations @xcite , and have been observed with transmission electron microscopy @xcite .",
    "these ripples can lead to interesting electronic @xcite , magnetic @xcite , and chemical properties @xcite , mostly due to the associated charge inhomogeneity and the changes in hybridization .",
    "in fact , folding graphene has been put forward as a way to modify its properties @xcite ; also , folded ribbons have been proposed as graphene - based electronic connectors between edges or graphene layers @xcite .",
    "all these schemes are pointing to a novel path to tune the characteristics of graphene - based systems , giving rise to the so - called `` origami '' graphene @xcite .",
    "folds , corrugations and wrinkles can also appear on top of multilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "this type of extended defect may lead to a stacking boundary between the two sides of the fold .",
    "contrary to boundaries produced by shear and tensile strains , the transport properties of corrugated bilayer graphene with a stacking boundary have not been yet investigated so thoroughly as in the strained bilayer .",
    "( color online ) .",
    "top and side view of bilayer graphene with an ab / ba stacking boundary due to a corrugation of the upper layer . the stacking change from ab to ba is clearly visible in the top view .",
    "the side view below shows the geometry chosen for the corrugation or fold , namely , half a nanotube . @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the lengths given in the number of unit cells of the bottom and top layer at the fold . ]    in this paper we consider stacking boundaries in bilayer graphene produced by a fold or corrugation of the top layer .",
    "such defect can be modeled as half a nanotube protruding from the plane of the upper layer ( see fig . [",
    "fig : system ] ) , seamlessly joined to the upper semiinfinite graphene planes .    in order to elucidate its electronic and transport properties ,",
    "we first study the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case , i.e. , a fold in a metallic armchair bilayer nanoribbon .",
    "then , we describe ab / ba stacking boundaries in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , namely , a corrugation in bilayer graphene .",
    "interestingly , we observe a drop of the conductance through the corrugation in the un - gated system .",
    "we attribute this conductance gap to the symmetry under the simultaneous exchange of layers and sublattices . by applying a gate voltage to the bottom layer",
    ", energy gaps open and a series of localized states appear in the gap .",
    "the states are mostly localized around the fold , although they extend appreciably into the leads , decaying with an oscillatory behavior . in many cases",
    "the absolute maximum of the local density of states ( ldos ) takes place outside the corrugation .",
    "we distinguish between valley - polarized topological states , originating from the stacking change , and eigenstates due to the finite size of the corrugation .",
    "we find that the states localized at the corrugation do not contribute to the conductance across the boundary , but constitute perfect conductance channels along this fold , in agreement with recent experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "in order to fix the notation , we refer to ab stacking when the a site from the bottom graphene layer , a1 , lies exactly below the b2 site of the top layer .",
    "likewise , ba stacking corresponds to the b1 site lying below the a2 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : system ] ) .",
    "the connection between ab and ba - stacked regions needs a deformation of the lattice .",
    "here we consider the stacking boundary to consist of a corrugated region , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "the central part connecting the two perfect ab and ba - stacked regions consists of two graphene layers , one of them longer , creating a fold .",
    "because of the graphene lattice symmetry , this kind of stacking boundary can be created in a simple way by connecting layers in ab and ba systems at a zigzag line .",
    "thus , the fold can be easily modeled as a portion of an armchair nanotube ; the bottom layer below the fold is a piece of flat zigzag ribbon seamlessly connected to the bottom layer of the leads .",
    "if we assume that the bilayer is situated on a substrate , the most natural configuration would have a flat bottom layer .",
    "the sizes of the bottom and top layers in the stacking boundary ( the central part ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are given in terms of the translational unit cell in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "for a given @xmath0 value we choose a larger @xmath1 length which allows for the change of stacking . as mentioned above",
    ", this extra length should naturally accommodate as a fold .",
    "we use a one - orbital tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian to describe the system .",
    "we assume uncoupled layers in the fold .",
    "only the nearest - neighbor hopping parameter @xmath3 ev is considered , and set the on - site energy @xmath4 .",
    "the bilayer leads with bernal stacking are described by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the single - layer hamiltonians corresponding to the bottom and top layer and the interlayer hamiltonian @xmath8 connects only those atoms which are on top of each other .",
    "the interlayer hopping parameter is taken as @xmath9 .",
    "we consider that the gate voltage @xmath10 is applied only to the bottom layer , as it would be in a reasonable experimental setup .",
    "since the system with a single corrugation has no translation symmetry in the @xmath2 direction ( perpendicular to the fold , see fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) , we compute the ldos and the conductance using the green function matching method .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the hamiltonians of the left ( l ) and right ( r ) leads , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is the hamiltonian of the conductor in central part of the system . in our case",
    "it is the region of the corrugation : the fold composed by half a nanotube plus a flat piece of graphene below , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the connections of the central part to the left and right lead , respectively .",
    "the green function of the central @xmath17 part is a function of the energy @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the self - energies of the leads with @xmath22 being the green functions of the leads .",

    "it is a tool successfully used for the analysis of the decay lengths of localized states in bulk systems @xcite , linear periodic molecules @xcite , as well as in graphene @xcite ; recently it has also been applied to topological insulators @xcite .",
    "here we additionally employ it to explain the oscillations of the corrugation - confined states .",
    "from both , the computational and the conceptual viewpoint , it is easier to address in the first place the properties of the 1d system , that is , a bilayer graphene nanoribbon with a wrinkle or corrugation in the top layer .",
    "such ribbon can be considered as a strip of 2d bilayer graphene with a corrugation . since we chose the zigzag direction to be parallel to the corrugation",
    ", this implies that the finite - size ribbon cut perpendicularly to this fold should be of the armchair type , as show in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] . as we are interested in the transport properties , we select the widths so that the bilayer nanoribbon leads are metallic at zero gate voltage . the width @xmath30 of the ribbon",

    "we observe a conductance drop , more dramatic in the case of the smaller corrugation .",
    "in fact , the maximum value of the conductance and the number of maxima in @xmath37 increases with the difference between the fold layer lengths @xmath38 .",
    "the conductance drop appears although both leads as well as the central part are metallic . to understand this",
    ", we should consider the spatial distribution of the scattering states , i.e. , those in the left and right leads . obviously , both leads , bilayer nanoribbons with ab and ba stacking , have exactly the same band structure , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_drop ] ( c ) . however , recall that their spatial distribution in the energy range @xmath37 is in the uncoupled nodes , these being b1 and a2 sites in the ab stacking and a1 and b2 sites in the ba case @xcite .",
    "we indicate this spatial distribution with open circles in the band structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_drop ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the localization in opposite sublattices is the reason behind the conductance drop . indeed , the longer the corrugation length , the larger the conductance in this energy region , as discussed above .",
    "this points to a symmetry related to the simultaneous exchange of sublattices and layers , broken in the presence of a fold .",
    "we have calculated an ideal abrupt ab / ba boundary , without any extra atoms for the fold , just by connecting directly an ab and a ba bilayer nanoribbon . if the hoppings across the boundary are kept equal ,",
    "then the conductance gap is perfect , due to the existence of the aforementioned symmetry : such idealized boundary is invariant under an exchange of sublattices and layer position .",
    "if the hoppings at the boundary are modified , the symmetry is broken and a small nonzero conductance is observed in the gap .",

    "[ fig : periodic_cond ] shows the conductance for a corrugated bilayer graphene plane with @xmath39 v with two different periodic corrugations .",
    "close to the fermi level we always have four conductance quanta , which are valley - polarized . increasing the size of the corrugation and the distance between them",
    ", there is a general rise of the conductance related to the increasing number of bands .",
    "however , around the fermi level the conductance is always equal to four @xmath79 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the topologically protected states are the only ones crossing @xmath33 . in a transport experiment",
    ", it is possible to employ a probe that contacts only one corrugation ; in such a case , the conductance close to @xmath33 in a gated system would be at most two conductance quanta belonging to a single valley .",

    "we have explored the electronic and transport properties of bilayer graphene and the corresponding metallic graphene nanoribbons with an ab / ba stacking boundary composed of a corrugation .",
    "we have shown that the transition between ab and ba zigzag - ended stackings can take place a fold formed by half a nanotube and a nanoribbon .    without an external gate voltage ,",
    "these systems are gapless , but present a conductance gap due to the symmetry mismatch related to the simultaneous exchange of sublattices and layers .",
    "the application of a gate voltage produces the appearance of gap states at the corrugation which are topologically protected in the absence of intervalley mixing .    for larger folds , more localized states appear at the corrugation , that we relate to quantum - size effects .",
    "these states are gapped , contrarily to those stemming form the change of stacking .",
    "we have analyzed the spatial dependence and transport properties of all these corrugation - localized states , verifying their oscillatory decay far from the corrugation , that we have related to the complex band structure of the bilayer regions .",
    "finally , we have shown that these states are conductive along the folds , constituting robust conductance channels that can be easily identified by their geometry , being extended folds or corrugations across bilayer graphene regions .",
