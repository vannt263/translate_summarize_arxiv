    "with the progressive downscaling of electron devices , whose size has reached well into the nanoscale , the quantum simulation of charge transport has become increasingly important .",
    "this study requires the numerical solution of the quantum wave equation for the charge carriers in the device .    in the case of periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the solution in the fourier domain represents a spontaneous alternative to a study in the direct space . in a fourier analysis ,",
    "all the functions appearing in the equation are replaced by their fourier expansions , and the fourier coefficients of the wave function become the unknowns of the problem , which in direct space approaches are instead the values of the wave function at the points of a discretization grid .",
    "the main advantage of this technique is the correct treatment of the derivatives . in a reciprocal space analysis ,",
    "each of the complex exponential functions appearing in the fourier expansions can be derived exactly , without any approximation . on the contrary , in a standard finite difference solution",
    ", the derivatives are replaced with finite difference approximations involving a certain number of samples of the function .",
    "this approximation introduces a distortion in the dispersion relation , which severely limits the accuracy of high - order solutions .",
    "the discretization error decreases if a finer grid is used , at the expense of an increase of the computational effort .",
    "moreover , in some cases , such as the solution of the dirac equation for massless fermions , the discretization of the equation on a direct space grid gives rise to problems such as the appearance of spurious solutions , or fermion doubling , unless proper , non - standard discretization techniques are applied ,  @xcite while these issues do not appear using a fourier solution technique .",
    "the solution in the reciprocal space is especially convenient when a continuum , envelope function description of the device is adopted and a slowly varying potential ( containing only a limited number of fourier components ) is considered .    here",
    ", we illustrate how the use of a particular set of periodic basis functions , obtained from the periodic repetition of sinc ( cardinal sine ) functions , makes it possible to obtain an exact description of the derivatives in the direct space and a solution approach equivalent to that in the reciprocal space .",
