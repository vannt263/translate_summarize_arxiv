    "a primary activity of the lhc program is the exploration of the properties of the higgs boson , which was discovered over two years ago by the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite .",

    "the couplings that are fixed through the well - measured diboson decays of the higgs are determined at the @xmath14@xmath15 level .",
    "no deviations from the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) have been observed .",
    "while the possibility of measuring the higgs - boson couplings to muons at the high - luminosity lhc ( hl - lhc ) has been studied  @xcite , the couplings of the higgs boson to first- and second - generation quarks are _ terra incognita_. they are only weakly constrained by the inclusive higgs - boson production cross sections , yet they can deviate significantly from their sm values in numerous theories of new physics .",
    "it was long thought to be impossible to measure these couplings , owing to the severe experimental difficulties that are inherent in reconstructing the signal and isolating it from the background .",
    "recent work has demonstrated that there is hope to determine the yukawa couplings of first- and second - generation quarks at future runs of the lhc . much of this renewed interest has arisen because of the realization that exclusive decays of the higgs boson to vector mesons can probe its couplings to light quarks .",
    "the resulting final states are relatively clean experimentally , and the theoretical predictions are also under control .",
    "the first manifestation of this idea was the discovery that decays of the higgs boson to an @xmath0-wave vector quarkonium plus a photon ( @xmath16 ) provide opportunities to determine the @xmath17 and @xmath18 couplings @xcite . [ here , @xmath19(@xmath20 ) and @xmath21(@xmath22 ) denote a charm ( bottom ) quark and charm ( bottom ) antiquark . ]",
    "while the @xmath17 coupling might be probed at the lhc by making use of charm - tagging techniques  @xcite , its phase must be determined through processes that involve quantum interference effects , such as the decay @xmath23 .",

    "these modes feature clean experimental signatures in which a high - transverse - momentum lepton pair recoils against a photon .",
    "they proceed through two distinct mechanisms :    * in the _ direct process _ , the higgs boson decays into a heavy quark - antiquark ( @xmath25 ) pair , one of which radiates a photon before forming a quarkonium with the other element of the pair .",

    "the coupling of the quarkonium to a virtual photon is known from the decay rate of the quarkonium to a lepton pair .",

    "<S> the numerical results include a previously calculated correction of order @xmath6 and summations , to all orders in @xmath6 , of leading logarithms of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the higgs - boson mass and @xmath9 is the heavy - quark mass . </S>",

    "<S> these refinements reduce the theoretical uncertainties in the direct - production amplitudes for @xmath12 and @xmath13 by approximately a factor of 3 and open the door to improved determinations at the lhc of the higgs - boson yukawa couplings to the charm and bottom quarks . </S>"
