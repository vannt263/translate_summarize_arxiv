    "in a superstrong external magnetic field the coulomb potential becomes screened @xcite .",
    "the screening occurs at the one - loop level ; the corresponding feynman diagram is the polarization operator insertion into the photon propagator .",
    "this phenomenon leads to the finiteness of the ground state energy of a hydrogen atom in the limit of infinite magnetic field @xmath3 ( without screening the ground state energy diverges as @xmath4 ) . in @xcite",
    "an analytical formula for the screened coulomb potential has been derived .",
    "it describes the behavior of the potential along the magnetic field and determines the atomic energies . in sect .",
    "ii of this paper we will derive the formula which describes the behavior of the screened coulomb potential in the direction transverse to the magnetic field .",
    "we will see that for @xmath5 in the transverse direction the coulomb potential is screened at all distances @xmath6 unlike in the longitudinal direction , where the screening takes place at @xmath7 , and in complete analogy with @xmath8 qed with light fermions analyzed in @xcite . in sect .",
    "iii we will investigate how the effects of higher loops modify the one - loop result for the coulomb potential .",
    "the contributions of higher loops are suppressed by powers of the fine structure constant @xmath9 .",
    "so with high accuracy the potential is determined by the one - loop result .    in papers @xcite the spectrum of energies on which the lowest landau level ( lll ) splits in the proton electric field was found by solving the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "according to @xcite the ground state energy of hydrogen in the limit of infinite @xmath3 equals @xmath10 kev , so the use of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation is at least selfconsistent .",
    "however , the size @xmath11 of the electron wave function for @xmath12 in the direction transverse to the magnetic field is much smaller than the electron compton wavelength , @xmath13 , which makes the nonrelativistic approach a bit suspicious . that is why starting from sect iv we will study the ground state energy of the electron in a hydrogen - like ion in the presence of an external magnetic field by analyzing the dirac equation . without taking screening into account this problem",
    "was considered in paper @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , soon after it was found that a hydrogen - like ion becomes critical at @xmath14 : the electron ground level sinks into the lower continuum ( @xmath15 ) and the vacuum becomes unstable by spontaneous @xmath16 pairs production .",
    "these results were obtained by solving the dirac equation for an electron moving in the field of a nucleus of finite radius . that the phenomenon of criticality appears only in the framework of the dirac equation",
    "is an additional motivation to go from schrdinger to dirac .",
    "according to @xcite the external magnetic field diminishes the value of the atomic charge @xmath0 at which the electron ground level enters the lower continuum .",
    "it happens because a large magnetic field makes the electron motion quasi - one - dimensional , and in @xmath17 the potential @xmath18 is more singular than in @xmath19 the potential @xmath20 .    in sect .",
    "iv from the numerical solution of the dirac equation for the ground electron level of a hydrogen atom in the coulomb potential we will find that the corrections to the nonrelativistic results are small and that the estimate @xmath21 works well .    in sect . v we will study how screening modifies the results of paper @xcite .",
    "the value of the magnetic field @xmath22 at which an ion with charge @xmath23 becomes critical increases because of screening and only ions with @xmath24 can become critical .",
    "let us point out at a major difference between our results and those of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the lower limit on @xmath23 above which the ion becomes critical originates from the non - zero size of its radius , which `` cuts off '' the singularity of the coulomb potential . at the opposite",
    ", our limit @xmath25 is universal and holds true even for a point - like nucleus . that the ion has a finite size only slightly strengthens the constraint .",
    "our results are summarized in table [ table4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : bcr ] , in which the value of @xmath26 at which the ion becomes critical is plotted as a function of its electric charge @xmath0 .",
    "the results including screening are given by the blue curve .",
    "if one omits screening , one gets the dashed - green curve : at the same value of @xmath0 , criticality with screening is seen to occur at larger b , enormously larger for @xmath27 .",
    "the underlying mechanism that prevents its occurrence is the freezing of the ground state energy of the electron , which can not go into the lower continuum . for @xmath28",
    "the screening of the ground state energies occurs in a relativistic regime .",
    "our starting point is the expression for the electric potential in the momentum representation @xmath30 where the one - loop contribution to the photon polarization operator in the external magnetic field is taken into account .",
    "it greatly simplifies when the external magnetic field is larger than the schwinger field : @xmath31 ( we use gauss units , @xmath32 ) .",
    "for such a strong magnetic field the polarization operator is dominated by the contribution of electrons which occupy lll , and a simple and rather accurate interpolation formula for it was suggested in @xcite . with the help of ( 8) and ( 12 ) from @xcite",
    "we obtain : @xmath33 and @xmath34 where we assume that the magnetic field @xmath3 is directed along the @xmath35 axis and @xmath36 is the momentum component parallel to @xmath3 , while @xmath37 and @xmath38 are vectors in the plane transverse to the magnetic field .",
    "the expression for the electric potential of a pointlike charge in the direction of the magnetic field at @xmath39 was obtained in @xcite : @xmath40 \\;\\ ; . \\label{3}\\ ] ]    for @xmath41 the potential equals coulomb up to small , power suppressed , terms , while for @xmath42 we get : @xmath43 where @xmath44 .    the behavior of the potential in the transverse plane ( @xmath45 ) can also be found analytically in the limit @xmath42 . performing the integration in ( [ 2 ] ) ( for @xmath46 the exponent in the denominator can be neglected ) we obtain : @xmath47 and the coulomb potential is screened at large @xmath48 in complete analogy with the @xmath8 case , see @xcite , eq .",
    "( 10 ) .",
    "for @xmath49 the values @xmath50 dominate in the integral ( [ 2 ] ) and we get : @xmath51    the equipotential lines at @xmath52 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath53    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the equipotential lines are shown .",
    "the behavior of the screened coulomb potential in the transverse plane was found numerically in @xcite , fig .",
    "@xmath54 given by expression ( [ 5 ] ) is close to the results shown in fig . 2 in @xcite for @xmath55 , within the domain of validity of ( [ 5 ] ) , and deviate from the curve for @xmath56 since it corresponds to @xmath57 , where ( [ 5 ] ) is inapplicable .    finally for @xmath58 expanding ( [ 6 ] ) we get ( @xmath59 is the angle between the two vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) : @xmath62 which coincides with the result obtained in @xcite where the expression for the photon polarization operator at @xmath63 was obtained as well .",
    "the expression for the screened coulomb potential was obtained in @xcite-@xcite from the one - loop contribution to the photon polarization operator in an external magnetic field @xmath64 . in momentum space",
    "it looks like ( see ( 13 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath65    if @xmath66-loop diagrams contain terms @xmath67 they would drastically change the shape of the potential in coordinate space .    to calculate the radiative corrections one should use the electron propagator @xmath68 in an external homogeneous magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "its spectral representation is a sum over landau levels and for @xmath69 the contribution of the lowest level dominates @xcite : @xmath70 where the magnetic field is directed along the third ( or @xmath35 ) axis ( @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the component of the momentum normal to the magnetic field and the projector @xmath74 selects the virtual electron state with spin opposite to the direction of the magnetic field . the contributions of the excited landau levels to @xmath75 yield a term in the denominator proportional to @xmath76 and they produce a correction of order @xmath77 in the denominator of ( [ 88 ] ) .",
    "two kind of terms contribute to the polarization operator at the two - loop level .",
    "first , there are terms in the electron propagators which represent the contributions of higher landau levels . just like",
    "in the one - loop case they produce corrections suppressed by @xmath78 in the denominator of ( [ 88 ] ) , i.e. terms of the order @xmath79 which can be safely neglected in comparison with the leading @xmath80 term .",
    "second , there is the contribution from the leading term ( [ 89 ] ) of the electron propagator .",
    "let us consider the simplest diagram : the photon dressing of the electron propagator . neglecting the electron mass we get : @xmath81=   -2\\hat k_{0,3}(1+i\\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 ) \\;\\ ; , \\label{90}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives zero when multiplied by the external propagator ( [ 89 ] ) of the electron , since @xmath82 .",
    "this result is a manifestation of the following well - known fact : in @xmath8 massless qed ( schwinger model ) all loop diagrams are zero except the one - loop term in the photon polarization operator .",
    "that is why the two loop diagrams in which the propagators of virtual electrons are given by ( [ 89 ] ) give contributions to the polarization operator proportional to @xmath83 for @xmath84 while in the opposite limit @xmath85 they should be proportional to @xmath86 in order for the photon to stay massless . so these terms are of the order of @xmath87 and they are not important .",
    "the generalization of the above arguments to higher loops is straightforward .    to conclude this section",
    "let us note that an analogous statement about the unimportance of the two - loop terms was made in @xcite .",
    "the ground state electron energy of a hydrogen - like ion with electric charge @xmath23 in an external magnetic field was analyzed in @xcite in the framework of the dirac equation . in a strong magnetic field ( @xmath89 the electron spectrum consists of the landau levels splitted into coulomb sublevels ; the ground level belongs to lll . in complete analogy with the nonrelativistic problem",
    "the adiabatic approximation is applicable .",
    "averaging over the fast motion of the electron in the plane transverse to the magnetic field , the dirac equation for the electron on lll was reduced in @xcite to two first order one - dimensional differential equations : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the energy eigenvalue of the dirac equation ; @xmath92 ; the bispinor @xmath93 of the electron is decomposed into @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "they describe the electron motion in the effective potential @xmath96 : @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 . at large distances @xmath100",
    "the effective potential equals coulomb , and the solutions of the equations ( [ eq:11 ] ) exponentially decreasing at @xmath101 are linear combinations of whittaker functions . at short distances the equations ( [ eq:11 ] )",
    "can be easily integrated for @xmath102 , which is equivalent to the following inequality : @xmath103 .",
    "matching short and large distance solutions at @xmath104 gives an algebraic equation for the ground state energy ( it coincides with eq .",
    "( 22 ) in @xcite in the limit @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the nucleus radius ) : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the euler constant , and the argument of the gamma function is given by @xmath109 for the ground level at @xmath110 one should take @xmath111 , while for @xmath112 it should be changed to @xmath113 .",
    "according to ( [ 9 ] ) when the magnetic field increases the ground state energy goes down and reaches the lower continuum .",
    "the value of the magnetic field at which this happens is determined by ( [ eq : ors32 ] ) ( see below ) .",
    "a matching point exists only if @xmath114 ( see ( [ eq:8a ] ) ) and ( [ 9 ] ) is valid only for these values of the magnetic field .",
    "however , as was checked in @xcite from ( [ 9 ] ) in the non - relativistic regime @xmath115 , @xmath116 , a formula can be deduced which is a valid solution of the non - relativistic problem and extends the domain of validity of eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "thus , without taking screening into account , from ( [ 9 ] ) we can obtain the dependence of the ground state energy of a hydrogen atom on the magnetic field for @xmath117 . in order to find the ground state energy at @xmath118 and to take screening into account we solve the equations ( [ eq:11 ] ) numerically .",
    "this system can be transformed into one second order differential equation for @xmath119 . by substituting @xmath120 a schrdinger - like equation for the function @xmath121",
    "was obtained in @xcite : @xmath122    @xmath123    where @xmath91 is the energy eigenvalue of the dirac equation and @xmath96 is given in ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "we integrated ( [ 11 ] ) numerically in the present work .",
    "leaving a detailed discussion for a future publication @xcite let us only note that , while for @xmath124 the last three terms in the expression for @xmath125 are much smaller than the first one ( the only one remaining in the nonrelativistic approximation ) , at @xmath126 the relativistic terms dominate and are very big for @xmath64 at @xmath127 which makes numerical calculations very complicated",
    ".    .[tab:1]values of @xmath128 for @xmath129 without screening obtained from the schrdinger and dirac equations .",
    "they start to differ substantially at enormous values of the magnetic field . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     textbooks @xcite contain detailed consideration of the phenomenon of critical charge .",
    "a magnetic field plays a double role in the critical charge phenomenon . by squeezing the electron wave function and putting it in the domain of a stronger coulomb potential it diminishes the value of the critical charge substantially @xcite .",
    "however , for nuclei with @xmath130 to become critical such a strong @xmath3 is needed that the screening of the coulomb potential occurs and acts in the opposite direction : the electron ground state energy freezes and the nucleus remains subcritical in spite of growing @xmath3 .",
