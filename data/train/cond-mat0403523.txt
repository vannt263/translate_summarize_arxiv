    "the process of protein synthesis , called `` translation , '' can be modeled using a driven lattice gas in one dimension @xcite .",
    "this type of model is well understood when all particle hopping rates are uniform , but a model for the real biological process requires nonuniform particle hopping rates .",
    "direct monte carlo simulation of such models is possible when only a few genes are involved .",
    "however , it is desirable to perform large - scale simulations to fit translation models to experimental data collected for many genes simultaneously ( e.g. , data from ) . for this purpose",
    ", monte carlo approaches would be computationally too slow .",
    "therefore , other analytical or computational methods are needed .    in this paper",
    ", we address the issue of quenched disorder ( site - dependent hopping rates ) in a driven lattice gas model for translation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is first described and its connection to biological protein synthesis explained .",
    "section [ sec : literature ] contains a brief summary of known results . in section [ sec : coarsegrained ] , we use a simple coarse - grained approach to obtain crude , approximate solutions .",
    "section [ sec : mgp ] treats our central topic : application of a mean field method @xcite to the problem of quenched disorder .",
    "analytical and computational results are presented . in section [ sec : twopoint ] , we extend the mean field approach to include two - point correlations for better accuracy .",
    "we close with a brief summary and discussion of how these methods may be applied to problems of interest , such as fitting translation models to experimental data .",
    "we focus on translation in prokaryotes , particularly _ escherichia coli _ , because of its relative simplicity .",
    "the process involves the synthesis of specific proteins based on the sequence of messenger rna ( mrna ) molecules .",
    "the mechanism consists of ribosomes `` reading '' the codons of mrna as the ribosomes move along an mrna chain , and the recruitment and assembly of amino acids ( appropriate to the codons being read ) to form a protein .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite , for more details . )",
    "this process is often described as three steps : initiation , where ribosomes attach themselves , one at a time , at the `` start '' end of the mrna ; elongation , where the ribosomes move down the chain in a series of steps ; and termination , where they detach at the `` stop '' codon . since ribosomes can not overlap , their dynamics is subject to the excluded volume constraint . apart from being impeded by another ribosome ( steric hinderance ) , a ribosome can not move until the arrival of an appropriate transfer rna , carrying the appropriate amino acid ( a combination known as aminoacyl - trna , or aa - trna ) . thus , the relative abundances of the approximately 60 types @xcite of aa - trna have significant effects on the elongation rate . assuming reactant availabilities in a cell are in their steady state , with a time - independent concentration of ribosomes and aa - trna , there would be an approximately steady current of ribosomes moving along the mrna , resulting in a specific production rate of this particular protein .",
    "our goal is the prediction of the protein production rates for various mrna s , as a function of the concentration of ribosomes and aa - trna s .",
    "the process of translation is well suited to modeling using a driven lattice gas in one dimension .",
    "particles enter at some rate on one end of a chain of discrete lattice sites ( initiation ) , then hop down the chain one site at a time with another rate or set of rates ( elongation ) , and finally exit the chain at the other end ( termination ) .",
    "the excluded volume constraint is implemented by insuring the spacing between ribosomes is no less than 12 sites , the approximate number of codons that a ribosome blocks @xcite .",
    "quenched disorder arises because there is non - uniformity in the hopping ( elongation ) rates along the chain .",
    "this effect occurs because at each codon , a ribosome has to `` wait '' for the appropriate aa - trna before continuing , and the various aa - trna s are present in nonequal abundances .",
    "the model we employ is the same as in @xcite .",
    "we model an mrna with @xmath0 codons as a chain of sites , each of which is labeled by @xmath1 .",
    "the first and last sites , @xmath2 , are associated with the start and stop codons , respectively . at any time , attached to the mrna are @xmath3 ribosomes ( particles ) .",
    "being a large complex of molecules , each ribosome will cover @xmath4 sites ( codons ) , with @xmath5 typically @xcite .",
    "any site may be covered by a single ribosome or none . in case of the latter",
    ", we will refer to the site as `` empty '' or `` occupied by a hole . '' to locate the ribosome , we arbitrarily choose the _ lowest _ site covered . for example , if the first @xmath6 sites are empty , a ribosome can bind in an initiation step , and then it is said to be `` on site @xmath7 . ''",
    "we define @xmath8 to be the ribosome density at site @xmath1 , where only the left end of the ribosome is counted .",
    "( in @xcite , particles were located by their right end , but either choice leads to the same rules of motion . ) we also define the coverage density @xmath9 , which is the probability that site @xmath1 is covered by some portion of a ribosome .",
    "next , we specify the dynamics of our model .",
    "an attached ribosome located at site @xmath1 will move to the next site ( @xmath10 ) with a rate @xmath11 , provided site @xmath12 is empty . for monte carlo simulations , it is convenient to update configurations in discrete time units @xmath13 . in implementing the simulations , it is better to use probabilities @xmath14 , so that a ribosome on site @xmath1 will be moved ( or not ) with probability @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) .",
    "we purposefully associate these hopping probabilities with a site because a site is associated with a particular codon .",
    "thus , the hopping rate from that site may depend on the relative abundance of the appropriate aa - trna .",
    "apart from these probabilities , another aspect of our simulations is random sequential updating : i.e. , during each monte carlo step ( mcs ) , @xmath17 particles are chosen at random , in sequence , to attempt moves .",
    "they are selected from a pool that includes the @xmath3 particles on the lattice plus another unbound particle that can initiate if there are @xmath4 holes at the beginning of the chain .    in our computational studies ,",
    "systems begin empty and are run for long enough to reach steady state .",
    "after steady state is attained , data including the current and density distribution can be collected .",
    "density data is typically collected every 100 mcs .",
    "we often use continuous time monte carlo @xcite because it runs far more quickly than and provides the same results as standard monte carlo . using continuous time monte carlo also avoids the need to specify a fixed time step @xmath13 .",
    "in our studies of real mrna sequences , we use gene sequences from _ escherichia coli _",
    "strain mg1655 , obtained from @xcite .",
    "elongation rates at each codon are estimated using commonly accepted values for the availability of trna in _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite",
    ". the rate at each codon is assumed proportional ( with an arbitrary proportionality constant ) to the availability of the appropriate trna that can decode the codon , as in @xcite .",
    "corresponding data are not available for estimating initiation and termination rates , so we choose various rates of interest to study .",
    "extensive investigations of the simple totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep , defined as point particles hopping with unit rate along a line ) with open boundaries can be found in the literature .",

    "they also found approximate density profiles ( related to the coverage density @xmath21 ) from a continuum limit . from all of these studies ,",
    "the @xmath22 phase diagram is well known .",
    "depending on the initiation ( or injection ) and termination ( or depletion ) rates , the system will settle into one of three phases . from their dominant characteristics ,",
    "the three phases are known as low density , high density , and maximal current .",
    "the initiation and termination probabilities are often referred to as @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the literature .",
    "a phase diagram in this @xmath25-@xmath26 plane has been determined , showing second order transitions between the maximal current phase and the others , as well as a first order transition between the high- and low - density regions .",
    "when disorder is introduced , i.e. , not all the @xmath27 s are equal , then methods for exact analytic approaches fail ( except in the extremely dilute limit , where only the motion of a single particle is of concern @xcite ) . indeed , even a single slow rate in a _ closed _ system poses serious difficulties @xcite . however , kolomeisky @xcite obtained approximate steady state solutions and phase diagrams for an _ open _ system with a single nonuniform rate in the bulk by splitting the system into two smaller systems connected by the nonuniform rate .",
    "tripathy and barma @xcite considered a closed system , but with a finite fraction of identical slow sites .",
