    "measurement of branching fractions and transition form factors of conversion decays provides an important test of vector dominance model  @xcite and an accurate background estimation in searches for quark - gluon plasma involving a lepton pair  @xcite .",

    "@xmath7 conversion decays into a @xmath23 pair and pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath24 or @xmath10 ) performed with the cmd-2 detector at the vepp-2 m collider  @xcite .",
    "the analysis is based on a data sample collected at 19 energy points in the 720",
    "  840  mev c.m .",
    "energy range and corresponding to 3.3  pb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity .",
    "this statistics contains about 3.3@xmath2510@xmath26 @xmath6 and 1.8@xmath2510@xmath26 @xmath7 decays . more detailed description of this analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the general purpose detector cmd-2 has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the tracking system consists of the cylindrical drift chamber ( dc ) with 250  @xmath27 resolution transverse to the beam plane and double - layer multiwire proportional z - chamber , both also used for the trigger .",
    "the tracking system is placed inside a thin ( 0.38  x@xmath28 ) superconducting solenoid with a field of 1  t. the barrel csi calorimeter with a thickness of 8.1  x@xmath28 placed outside the solenoid has energy resolution for photons of about 9% in the energy range from 100 to 700  mev .",

    "the end - cap bgo calorimeter with a thickness of 13.4  x@xmath28 placed inside the solenoid has energy and angular resolution varying from 9% to 4% and from 0.03 to 0.02 radians , respectively , for the photon energy in the range 100 to 700  mev . the barrel and end - cap calorimeter systems cover a solid angle of @xmath29 radians .",
    "the decay @xmath12 has been studied using the @xmath30 dominant decay mode @xmath31 .",
    "it corresponds to a final state with two opposite charge particles and two photons .",
    "one of the significant resonant backgrounds comes from the @xmath32 decay which has the same topology of the final state and more than three orders of magnitude larger probability .",
    "another source of resonant background is the @xmath33 decay followed by the dalitz decay of the @xmath30 or @xmath34-quantum conversion in the material in front of the drift chamber .",
    "most conversions occur in the beam pipe , at the distance of 1.8 cm from the interaction point .",
    "since the dc spatial resolution is not sufficient to separate events with conversions in the beam pipe from those where it occurs at the interaction point , the contribution of this background was subtracted based on monte carlo simulation ( mc ) .",
    "the non - resonant background includes contributions from the following qed processes with the same final state topology : @xmath35 , @xmath36 followed by @xmath34-quantum conversions , @xmath37 with one background photon as well as two - quantum annihilation followed by a @xmath34-quantum conversion and one background photon in calorimeters .",
    "the data analysis consists of two parts : a measurement of the branching fraction and a study of the transition form factor .",
    "the selection criteria used for the measurement of the branching fractions were tuned to select a `` pure '' set of events under study and thus reject events with a large invariant mass of @xmath23 which contain a lot of background .",
    "however , this very range is of main interest for a study of the transition form factor .",
    "therefore , for the latter a special set of selection criteria including a technique of e/@xmath24 separation  @xcite was applied to suppress the main background from 3@xmath24 events .",
    "at the first stage of selection , the following criteria were applied to events with two tracks and at least two photons to enrich a data sample with events of the studied decays :    * the photon energy @xmath39  mev and its polar angle @xmath40 to suppress background photons in the calorimeters ; * the impact parameter of the tracks @xmath41  cm and z - coordinate of the vertex @xmath42  cm to reject cosmic rays and beam background events ; * the total momentum of the tracks @xmath43 does not strongly differ from the photon momentum @xmath44 in the @xmath33 decay at a given energy @xmath45  mev / c to suppress @xmath32 events as well as @xmath33 events followed by the dalitz decay of the @xmath30 .",

    "the parameterization included a logarithmic gaussian for the signal and a second order polynomial for the background .",
    "the shape of these functions was fixed , so the floating parameters were the numbers of events of each type only .",
