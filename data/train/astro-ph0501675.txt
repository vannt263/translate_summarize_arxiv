    "recent observations of type ia supernovae @xcite as well as concordance with other observations ( including the microwave background and galaxy power spectra ) indicate that the universe is accelerating .",
    "possible explanations for such an acceleration include a variety of dark energy models in which the universe is vacuum dominated , such as a cosmological constant . in 1986",
    ", we explored the possibility of a time - dependent vacuum @xcite characterized by an equation of state @xmath2 .",
    "quintessence models @xcite utilize a rolling scalar field to achieve time dependence of the vacuum .    as an alternative approach to explain the acceleration , we proposed modifications to the friedmann equation in lieu of having any vacuum energy at all @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) . in our cardassian model , the universe is flat and accelerating , and yet consists only of matter and radiation .",
    "the usual friedmann equation governing the expansion of the universe @xmath3 is modified to become @xmath4 where @xmath5 contains only matter and radiation ( no vacuum ) , @xmath6 is the hubble constant ( as a function of time ) , @xmath7 is newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath8 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "we note here that the geometry is flat , as required by measurements of the cosmic background radiation @xcite , so that there are no curvature terms in the equation .",
    "there is no vacuum term in the equation .",
    "the model does not address the cosmological constant ( @xmath9 ) problem ; we simply set @xmath10 .",
    "we take @xmath11 to be a function of @xmath5 that returns simply to @xmath12 at early epochs , but that takes a different form that drives an accelerated expansion in the recent past of the universe at @xmath13 .",
    "i begin by describing the phenomenology of cardassian models , and then turn to the motivation for modified friedmann equations of this form .",
    "the new term required may arise , e.g. , as a consequence of our observable universe living as a 3-dimensional brane in a higher dimensional universe .",
    "a second possible interpretation of cardassian expansion is developed @xcite , in which we treat the modified friedman equations as due to a fluid , in which the energy density has new contributions with negative pressure ( possibly due to dark matter with self - interactions ) .",
    "the simplest version of cardassian expansion invokes the addition of a new power law term to the right hand side of the friedmann equation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a number with @xmath16 the new term is initially negligible , and only comes to dominate at redshift @xmath17 .",
    "once it dominates , it causes the universe to accelerate .",
    "we take the usual energy conservation : @xmath18 which gives the evolution of matter : @xmath19 here subscript @xmath20 refers to today .",
    "eqs.([eq : general ] ) and ( [ eq : energy ] ) contain the complete information of the expansion history .",
    "the new term in eq.([eq : new ] ) ( the second term on the right hand side ) is initially negligible ; hence ordinary early universe cosmology , including nucleosynthesis , results .. the new term only comes to dominate recently , at the redshift @xmath21 indicated by the supernovae observations .",
    "once the second term dominates , it causes the universe to accelerate .",
    "when the new term is so large that the ordinary first term can be neglected , we find @xmath22 so that the expansion is superluminal ( accelerated ) for @xmath23 . as examples , for @xmath24 we have @xmath25 ; for @xmath26 we have @xmath27 ; and for @xmath28 we have @xmath29 . for @xmath30",
    "the acceleration is increasing ( the cosmic jerk ) .",
    "there are two free parameters in the power law model , @xmath31 and @xmath15 ( or equivalently , @xmath32 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "we choose one of these parameters to make the second term term kick in at the right time to explain the observations .",
    "as yet we have no explanation of the coincidence problem ; i.e. , we have no explanation for the timing of @xmath32 .",
    "such an explanation may arise in the context of extra dimensions .",
    "observations of the cosmic background radiation show that the geometry of the universe is flat with @xmath33 .",
    "how can we reconcile this with a theory made entirely of matter ( and radiation ) and yet observations of the matter density that indicate @xmath34 ?",
    "in the cardassian model we need to revisit the question of what value of energy density today , @xmath35 , corresponds to a flat geometry .",
    "we will show that the energy density required to close the universe is much smaller than in a standard cosmology , so that matter can be sufficient to provide a flat geometry .    from evaluating eq.([eq : new ] ) today , we have @xmath36 the energy density @xmath35 that satisfies eq.([hubbletoday ] ) is , by definition , the critical density .",
    "the usual value of the critical density is found by solving the equation with only the first term ( with @xmath37 ) , so that @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the hubble constant today in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "however , in the presence of the second term , we can solve eq.([hubbletoday ] ) to find that the critical density @xmath40 has been modified from its usual value to a different number @xmath41 .",
    "we use our second free parameter to fix this number to give @xmath42 so that @xmath43 .",
    "hence the universe can be flat , matter dominated , and accelerating , with a matter density that is 0.3 of the old critical density .",
    "matter can provide the entire closure density of the universe .",
    "an equivalent formulation of power law cardassian is @xmath44 .\\ ] ] the first term inside the bracket dominates initially but the second term takes over once the energy density has dropped to the value @xmath45 . here",
    ", @xmath45 is the energy density at which the two terms are equal : the ordinary energy density term on the right hand side of the frw equation is equal in magnitude to the new term . for reasonable parameters , @xmath46gm/@xmath47 .",
    "since the modifications are important only for @xmath48 , solar system physics is completely unaffected .",
    "the power law cardassian model with an additional term @xmath49 satisfies many observational constraints : the universe is somewhat older , the first doppler peak in the microwave background is slightly shifted , early structure formation ( @xmath50 ) is unaffected , but structure will stop growing sooner .",
    "in addition the modifications to the poisson equation will affect cluster abundances and the isw affect in the cmb .",
    "we note that , with regard to observational tests , one can make a correspondence between the @xmath49 cardassian and quintessence models for constant @xmath15 ; we stress , however , that the two models are entirely different .",
    "quintessence requires a dark energy component with a specific equation of state ( @xmath51 ) , whereas the only ingredients in the cardassian model are ordinary matter ( @xmath52 ) and radiation ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "however , as far as any observation that involves only @xmath54 , or equivalently @xmath55 , the two models predict the same effects on the observation .",
    "regarding such observations , we can make the following identifications between the cardassian and quintessence models : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , where @xmath2 is the quintessence equation of state parameter , @xmath59 is the ratio of matter density to the ( old ) critical density in the standard frw cosmology appropriate to quintessence , @xmath60 is the ratio of quintessence energy density to the ( old ) critical density , and @xmath61 . in this way",
    ", the cardassian model with @xmath49 can make contact with quintessence with regard to observational tests .",
    "we note that generalized cardassian models can be distinguished from generic quintessence models with upcoming precision cosmological experiments .",
    "we can find the best fit of the cardassian parameters @xmath15 and @xmath32 to current cmb and supernova data .",
    "the current best fit is obtained for @xmath62 , or , equivalently , @xmath63 @xcite and @xmath64 . as an example , for @xmath65 ( equivalently , @xmath66 ) , we find that @xmath67",
    ". then the position of the first doppler peak is shifted by a few percent .",
    "the age of the universe is 13 gyr @xcite .",
    "there are some indications that @xmath68 may give a good fit @xcite and this case of phantom cosmology will be discussed below .",
    "more generally , we consider other forms of @xmath11 in eq.(3 ) , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "for example , a simple generalization of eq.([eq : new ] ) is modified polytropic cardassian : @xmath69^{1/q}\\ ] ] with @xmath70 and @xmath23 .",
    "the right hand side returns to the ordinary friedmann equation at early times , but becomes @xmath49 at late times , just as in eq.([eq : new2 ] ) .",
    "other examples of generalized cardassian have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows comparisons by wang et al @xcite of mp cardassian models with current supernova data . clearly the models fit the existing data .",
    "the figure also shows predictions out to @xmath71 for future supernova data .",
    "future supernova data will thus allow one to differentiate between cardassian models , quintessence models , and cosmological constant models .",
    "comparison of mp cardassian models ( see eq.([eq : mpc ] ) with current supernova data , as well as predictions out to @xmath71 for future data . for comparison ,",
    "dotted lines indicate @xmath72 as labelled on the right hand side of the plot .",
    "we see that mp cardassian models with @xmath73 and @xmath74 ranging from 1 - 3 match the current data , and can be differentiated from generical cosmological constant or quintessence models in future data .",
    ", width=576,height=576 ]      a number of additional observational tests can be used to test the models .",
    "we plan to use the code cmbfast to further constrain cardassian parameters in light of cosmic background radiation data ( wmap ) .",
    "in particular , the integrated sachs wolfe effect may differentiate cardassian from generic quintessence models .",
    "a second approach is number count tests such as deep2 . the abundance of galaxy haloes of fixed rotational speed depend on the comoving volume element .",
    "third , the alcock - paczynski test compares the angular size of a spherical object at redshift @xmath75 to its redhsift extent @xmath76 . depending on the cosmology",
    ", the spherical object may look squooshed in redshift space .",
    "a proposed trick @xcite is to use the correlation function of lyman - alpha clouds as spherical objects .",
    "we present two possible origins for cardassian models .",
    "the original idea arose from consideration of braneworld scenarios , in which our observable universe is a three dimensional membrane embedded in extra dimensions . recently , as a second interpretation of cardassian cosmology , we have investigated an alternative four - dimensional fluid description . here , we take the ordinary einstein equations , but the energy density has additional terms ( possibly due to dark matter with self - interactions characterized by negative pressure ) .      in braneworld scenarios ,",
    "our observable universe is a three dimensional membrane embedded in extra dimensions . for simplicity , we work with one extra dimension . in this five - dimensional world , we take the metric to be @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the coordinate in the direction of the fifth dimension , @xmath8 is the usual scale factor of our observable universe and @xmath79 is the scale factor in the fifth dimension .",
    "we found @xcite that one does not generically obtain the usual friedmann equation on the observable brane .",
    "in fact , by a suitable choice of the bulk energy momentum tensor , one may obtain a friedmann equation on our brane of the form @xmath80 for any @xmath15 .",
    "more generally , one can obtain other modifications .",
    "@xcite showed that for an antidesitter bulk one obtains a quadratic correction @xmath81 , but more generally one can obtain any power of @xmath15 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the origin of these modifications to the friedmann equations is as follows .",
    "we consider the five dimensional einstein equations , @xmath82 where the 5d newton s constant is related to the 5d planck mass as @xmath83 .",
    "the 5d einstein tensor on the left hand side is given by @xmath84 in the above expressions , a prime stands for a derivative with respect to @xmath78 , and a dot for a derivative with respect to @xmath85 .",
    "these 5d einstein equations are supplemented by boundary conditions ( known as israel conditions ) due to the existence of our 3-brane .",
    "these boundary conditions are exactly analogous to those of a charged plate in electromagnetism . there ,",
    "the change in the perpendicular component of the electric field as one crosses a plate with charge per area @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 .",
    "there are two analogous boundary conditions here ; one is @xmath88 i.e. the change in the derivative of the scale factor as one crosses our 3-brane is given by the energy density on the brane .",
    "the combination of the 5d einstein equations with these boundary conditions leads to the modified friedmann equations on our observable three dimensional universe .",
    "depending on what is in the bulk ( off the brane ) , one can obtain a variety of possibilities such as @xmath80 @xcite . though we were at first",
    "concerned that such modifications would be bad for cosmology , in fact they can explain the observed acceleration of the universe today .",
    "currently one of our pressing goals would be to find a simple five - dimensional energy momentum tensor that produces the cardassian cosmology .",
    "while we succeeded in constructing an ugly toy model , it obviously does not represent our universe .",
    "unfortunately , going from four to five dimensions is not unique , and is difficult .",
    "another pressing goal is to find testable predictions of cardassian cosmology .",
    "we want to be certain that ordinary astrophysical results are not affected in an adverse way ; e.g. , we want energy momentum to be conserved . in the interest of addressing these types of questions",
    ", we developed a four dimensional fluid description of cardassian cosmology @xcite .",
    "this may be an effective picture of higher dimensional physics , or may be completely independent of it .",
    "this fluid description may serve as a second possible motivation for cardassian cosmology .    here",
    "we use the ordinary friedmann equation , @xmath89 and the ordinary four dimensional einstein equation , @xmath90 we take the energy density to be the sum of two terms : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a cardassian contribution . accompanying the two terms in the energy density",
    "are two pressure terms : @xmath93 where the thermodynamics of an adiabatically expanding universe tell us that @xmath94 these total energy density and pressure terms are what enter into the four dimensional energy momentum tensor : @xmath95    energy conservation is then automatically guaranteed : @xmath96 this equation implies a modified continuity equation , and a modified euler s equation .",
    "we also require particle number conservation .",
    "poisson s equation is also modified and becomes , in the newtonian limit , @xmath97    as an example , we can show the fluid description of the power law cardassian model .",
    "we have @xmath98 and @xmath99 which is a negative pressure for @xmath23 .",
    "the poisson equation becomes @xmath100\\ ] ] one can show that this simplified model runs into trouble on galactic scales .",
    "there is a new force @xmath101 that destroys flat rotation curves .",
    "the fluid power law cardassian must be thought of as an effective model which applies only on large scales .",
    "hence , we proposed another possible model , the modified polytropic cardassian model described earlier .",
    "due to the existence of the additional parameter @xmath74 , which is important on small scales , rotation curves are fine .",
    "some cardassian models can satisfy the dominant energy condition @xmath102 even with a dark energy component @xmath103 , since both the ordinary and cardassian components of the energy density are made of the same matter and radiation .",
    "for example , the mp cardassian model wtih n=0.2 and q=2 has @xmath104 .",
    "there is some evidence that @xmath104 matches the data @xcite .",
    "we here speculate on an origin for the new cardassian term in the total energy density in the fluid model",
    ". the dark matter may be subject to a new , long - range confining force ( fifth force ) @xmath105 this may be analagous to quark confinement that exhibits negative pressure .",
    "our basic point of view is that cardassian cosmology gives an attractive phenomenology , in that it is very efficient : matter can provide all the observed behavior of the universe . therefore it is worthwhile to examine all the avenues we can think of as to the origin of these modified friedmann terms ( or alternatively of the fluid model ) .",
    "we have presented @xmath106 as a modification to the friedmann equation in order to suggest an explanation of the recent acceleration of the universe . in the cardassian model , the universe can be flat and yet matter dominated .",
    "we have found that the new cardassian modifications can dominate the expansion of the universe after @xmath107@xmath108 and can drive an acceleration .",
    "we have found that matter alone can be responsible for this behavior .",
    "the current value of the energy density of the universe is then smaller than in the standard model and yet is at the critical value for a flat geometry .",
    "such a modified friedmann equation may result from the existence of extra dimensions .",
    "further work is required to find a simple fundamental theory responsible for eq.([eq : new ] ) .",
    "a second possible motivation for cardassian cosmology , namely a fluid description , has been developed @xcite , which allows us to compute everything astrophysical .",
    "comparison with sn observations , both current and upcoming , were made and shown in figure 1 . in future work",
    ", we plan to complete a study of density perturbations in order to allow us to make predictions with observations , e.g. of cluster abundance or the isw effect so that we may separate this model from others in upcoming observations .",
    "this paper reflects work with collaborators matt lewis , paolo gondolo , yun wang , josh frieman , chris savage , and nori sugiyama .",
