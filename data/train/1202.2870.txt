    "<S> the factor of three comes from the fact that the periodic potential creates three superlattice dirac points corresponding to the three reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath28 . from the fit </S>",
    "<S> , we extract the value of the fermi velocity at the dirac point to be @xmath37 m / s for both electrons and holes . at the new superlattice dirac points , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi velocity is reduced to @xmath38 m / s for the new electrons and @xmath39 m / s for the new holes . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction agrees with recent theoretical predictions  @xcite and our numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for the presence of the superlattice dirac point can also be seen in the global conductivity as a function of gate voltage ( see supplementary information ) .        </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the formation of superlattice dirac points , the presence of the periodic potential also leads to a spatial variation in the ldos . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : moire_scan ] shows experimental and numerical images of the ldos as a function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> near the dirac point , ( figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : moire_scan ] ( b ) and ( e ) ) , we observe a nearly featureless density of states . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with previous stm measurements which show a strong suppression of charge fluctuations in graphene on hbn  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> at higher energies , the presence of the moir potential manifests itself as a local variation in the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig : moire_scan ] ( a ) and ( d ) are taken at a lower energy than the superlattice dirac point in the valence band . at this energy </S>",
    "<S> the hexagonal pattern of the potential is clearly visible . on the conduction band side , </S>",
    "<S> figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : moire_scan ] ( c ) and ( f ) , the moir pattern is once again visible but its contrast is inverted . the centers of the hexagons now correspond to points of increased density of states . </S>",
    "<S> these ldos modulations indicate that the fermi velocity is spatially dependent . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the inversion indicates that the relative strength of the potential locally determines whether electrons or holes have a higher fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the moir pattern becomes much more visible in the local density of states at energies above the superlattice dirac points . </S>",
    "<S> previous measurements of the ldos in graphene on hbn did not observe any variations due to the short moir patterns and low energies probed  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> graphene on hbn devices are becoming widely used due to their improved mobility and reduced charged impurities . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that lattice mismatch and relative rotation between the graphene and hbn leads to a periodic potential for graphene charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> this potential creates a new dirac point whose energy is determined by the wavelength of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> this superlattice dirac point has the potential to control the transport properties of electrons in graphene as it induces spatially modulated velocities for the charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> future work is necessary to exploit this periodic potential for the creation of novel graphene devices . </S>"
