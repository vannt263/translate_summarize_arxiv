    "neutrino oscillation measurements have become more and more accurate .",
    "the latest combined results @xcite read @xmath3and @xmath4 , for the mass squared differences of the large mixing angle solution ( lma ) to the solar neutrino problem @xcite , and for atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , respectively . both mass differences are sub - ev , but the neutrino mass scale is not yet certain .",
    "neutrino data also hint at the possibility of more than three massive , mostly active neutrinos .",
    "the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) collaboration @xcite has reported evidence for a @xmath5 flux @xmath6 meters away from a source of @xmath7 , produced in @xmath8 with subsequent @xmath9 decay .",
    "the unexpected flux can be explained if there is a small probability @xmath10 for a neutrino produced as a @xmath7 to be detected as a @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this lsnd anomaly has yet to be confirmed , and the miniboone experiment at fermilab @xcite should very soon give a definitive confirmation or refutation .",
    "numerous attempts to solve the lsnd puzzle , however , have already been proposed @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that oscillations with extra sterile neutrinos can fit the lsnd anomaly @xcite .",
    "but it has also been pointed out that extra sterile neutrinos could be in conflict with big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite , as well as sn1987a supernova neutrino events @xcite . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", it has been argued that , if the right - handed neutrino majorana scale @xmath11 is of @xmath12 , adequate fits to the lsnd data can be obtained .",
    "ev seesaw \" scenario runs against theoretical arguments in favor of a very large @xmath11 . to name a few such arguments : the canonical seesaw mechanism @xcite with @xmath13",
    "can elegantly explain why neutrino masses are so small , even with lepton yukawa couplings that are of order one ; thermal leptogenesis @xcite points to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , nothing _ experimental _",
    "is really known about the magnitude of @xmath11 , except perhaps the lsnd result , which is at ev scale .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to show that the ev seesaw proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be straightforwardly incorporated in a four generation scenario .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) with a sequential fourth generation ( sm4 ) is not ruled out by electroweak precision measurements , if one allows the extra active neutrino to have mass close to @xmath15 gev @xcite . to avoid bounds from direct search at lep",
    "ii @xcite , mixing of the fourth heavy neutrino with the three light neutrinos should be small @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear that in standard seesaw with @xmath17 gev , an extra generation is hard to accommodate ( a different approach to predict a light sterile neutrino in the presence of a fourth generation is the so called  flipped seesaw \" @xcite ) .",
    "all four ( mostly ) active neutrinos will then be light , contradicting the invisible @xmath18 width which measures only three light neutrinos . but taking @xmath11 at scale @xmath19 , one can now have a sufficiently heavy fourth neutrino . in the following",
    "we will show that , by taking @xmath20 , the fourth neutrino is pseudo - dirac and heavy .",
    "it will not affect the invisible @xmath18 width , and largely decouples from lower generations . aside from three mostly active light neutrinos , three sterile neutrinos with mass @xmath21 is predicted .",
    "a numerical analysis gives results consistent with the lsnd as well as solar and atmospheric data .",
    "it seems that @xmath22 can not be large .",
    "following ref . @xcite but allowing for a possible 4th generation , the @xmath23 neutrino mass matrix @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 in a form suggestive of mass hierarchies . in the basis where the @xmath26 dirac mass matrix is diagonal , the dominant dirac mass for the 4th generation arises from @xmath27 where @xmath28 gev , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 matrices with zero elements , except 1 in 44 element of @xmath30 .",
    "the right - handed majorana mass matrix is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 ev @xcite , and @xmath34 is a @xmath31 symmetric matrix with elements @xmath35 .",
    "the third matrix is @xmath36 which is pinned more to the @xmath11 scale , with @xmath37 where @xmath38 has been absorbed into @xmath39 .",
    "clearly , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 considerably less than 1 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be treated as perturbations to @xmath44 .",
    "we note that the neutrino mass matrix of eq .",
    "( [ massmatrix ] ) could arise from very small deviations from a democratic structure for the dirac contribution @xcite , and lepton number is assumed to be only slightly violated .",
    "the latter requires @xmath45 @xcite , i.e. symmetry is enhanced in the limit of @xmath46 .",
    "having smaller elements in @xmath47 compared to @xmath11 is purely phenomenological @xcite .",
    "the dominant @xmath44 has six null eigenvalues , plus two eigenvalues @xmath48 .",
    "for the eigenvectors associated with zero eigenvalues , one can choose @xmath49 with @xmath50 in the @xmath51 position for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "for the eigenvalues @xmath54 and @xmath39 , the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath55 . at zeroth order in @xmath56 , the states @xmath57 and @xmath58 combine into a pure dirac state of mass @xmath39 .",
    "when linear corrections in @xmath56 are considered , the perturbed states @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 have masses which differ by @xmath62 , and they now correspond to a pseudo - dirac neutrino with mass @xmath63 , which we denote as @xmath64 ( the charged partner is denoted @xmath65 , with @xmath66 gev @xcite ) .    for the six null eigenvalues of @xmath44 , one can apply perturbation theory with degeneracies .",
    "a linear combination of the degenerate unperturbed states @xmath67 diagonalizes the @xmath68 perturbation .",
    "that is , by diagonalizing the @xmath69 perturbation matrix @xmath70 one obtains the corrections of @xmath62 to the mass eigenvalues , and the correct eigenstates at order zero .",
    "for the effect of the 4th generation neutrino through the right - handed sector , @xmath71 , one has linear corrections in @xmath56 proportional to @xmath72 to the eigenvalues @xmath48 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 as already stated , and @xmath73 corrections to all the other eigenvalues .",
    "the big hierarchy between the matrix elements @xmath74 , @xmath75 and all the others allow the fourth generation to largely decouple from the other three . as stated in the introduction , this is also required by direct search limits that demand very small mixings between @xmath64 and the light neutrino flavors .    having reduced the problem to a @xmath76 case , the analysis performed in @xcite suggests that one could find a solution to the lsnd puzzle .",
    "our main goal here is to confirm the possibility of an existing solution , and to gain some insight on what could be a plausible scenario .",
    "we set to zero all phases for simplicity , since there are already too many parameters .",
    "we define @xmath77 to be the rotation matrix which diagonalizes @xmath78 .",
    "having started in the basis where the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath79 is diagonal , one still has the freedom to perform a rotation @xmath80 in the left sector @xmath81 we assume no mixing between the fourth and first three generation charged leptons , as already discussed . for the right sector , a rotation will just change @xmath71 to @xmath82 , resulting in no change to our numerical analysis .",

    "we remark that , although a full analysis is needed to tell if our model is able to accommodate both nsbl and lsnd data , our predictions seem to be not too far away from the results of ref .",

    "( [ mixingangle ] ) and  ( [ u ] ) , we find @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 as expected , the values for @xmath109 and @xmath113 are in good agreement with data , but the as yet unmeasured @xmath2 turns out to be rather small .",
    "to investigate the possibility for a bigger value of @xmath2 , we restrict the @xmath120 to the four inputs of @xmath122 and @xmath177 .",
    "the mass spectrum is not affected by the rotation of eq .",
    "( [ uprpr ] ) . with @xmath41 and @xmath71 given as in eq .",
    "( [ m3x3num ] ) , we first fix @xmath178 and perform a @xmath120 fit vs @xmath179 and @xmath148 .",
    "we iterate with fixing @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) and minimize @xmath120 vs @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( @xmath147 and @xmath179 ) .",
    "we find for both cases of fixing @xmath147 and @xmath148 to the values found in previous section , @xmath113 is quite strongly dependent on @xmath179 , and the value around 0.98 is preferred .",
    "we thus illustrate with fixing @xmath149 .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the contour plot of @xmath120 vs @xmath182 .",
    "the three different shaded regions should not be interpreted as the @xmath150 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 regions , since we have fixed the rest of the parameters to the best fit values .",
    "but they still give an indication of variations around the best fit region under the above assumptions .    in fig .",
    "2 we plot the four quantities @xmath177 , @xmath109 , @xmath113 and @xmath2 vs @xmath147 and @xmath148 , for the solution on the lower right of fig",
    ". 1 . the same is plotted in fig .  3 for the upper left solution .",
    "again , @xmath41 and @xmath71 are fixed as in eq .",
    "( [ m3x3num ] ) , and @xmath179 is held fixed at 0.98 .",
    "we see that @xmath183 can reach the one @xmath141 region and @xmath109 is well within range .",
    "however , to push @xmath2 beyond 0.01 , @xmath113 seems to wander away from maximal mixing of 0.5 , and values at @xmath184 or 0.6 has to be tolerated .",
    "we note further that the sensitivity of @xmath113 is to @xmath147 , rather than @xmath148 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath2 greater than 0.01 is possible , but seemingly not preferred .",
    "it is not clear whether this is an artefact of not being able to do a real fit .",
    "note that we have not checked explicitly whether constraints from short baseline disappearance experiments are fully satisfied .",
    "it is tempting to consider whether mixing between the fourth and the first three light charged lepton generations could modify the situation with @xmath2 .",
    "but as already mentioned in the introduction , one needs to satisfy both bounds from direct search at lep ii and electroweak precision measurements .",
    "we have pursued a numerical study , but find that , if we wish to keep the mixings sufficiently small so that the fourth active heavy neutrino will be semi - stable , no important change with respect to the no - mixing case is observed .",
    "we note that the heavy neutrino could be heavier than 50 gev and still with suppressed mixing to lower generations , but then one would have to face electroweak precision constraints .",
    "we note in passing that semi - stable heavy neutrinos are still of interest  @xcite to dark matter search experiments , as a fourth heavy lepton was once a leading dark matter candidate .    in summary",
    ", we have extended the ev seesaw scenario to four lepton generations .",
    "taking the lsnd scale as the right - handed seesaw scale @xmath33 ev , one has a heavy pseudo - dirac neutrino with mass @xmath185 gev , which largely decouples from other generations , and is relatively stable .",
    "one effectively has a @xmath1 solution to the lsnd anomaly , where we illustrate with numerical solutions . as a possible outcome",
    ", our numerical study indicates that the third mixing angle , @xmath2 , seems to be less than 0.01 .",
