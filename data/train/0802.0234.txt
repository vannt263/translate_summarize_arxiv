    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are among the leading candidates for the dark matter ( dm ) component in the universe .",
    "the framework is elegant and simple : stable wimps can be embedded in most extensions to the standard model of particle physics . in thermal equilibrium in the early universe ,",
    "they decouple from the primordial bath in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "their relic abundance scales approximatively with the inverse of their total pair annihilation rate into lighter particles : the weak - interaction coupling ensures that , within the standard cosmological scenario , such relic density is of the order of the mean density of dm in the universe today , as determined in cosmological observations ( for comprehensive reviews on wimp dm candidates and their detection , see , e.g. , @xcite )    in principle , one of the routes to test the hypothesis of wimp dm stems from the bases of the framework themselves .",
    "supposing that wimps are indeed the building blocks of all structures in the universe , there is a ( small but finite ) probability that wimps in dm halos , including the halo of the milky way , annihilate in pairs into detectable species .",
    "indirect detection has mainly been focused on the search for a wimp - induced component in the local antiproton , positron , and antideuteron cosmic - ray fluxes and for an excess in the high - energy gamma - ray galactic or extra - galactic flux ( relevant constraints on the wimp parameter space have been derived from such analyses ; for recent results , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "since the gamma - ray signal scales with the square of the wimp density along the line of sight , the galactic center ( gc ) has been often indicated as the prime target . in any self - consistent model for the distribution of dm in galactic halos , the dm density is found to be maximal at the center of the system ; numerical n - body simulations of hierarchical clustering in cold dark matter cosmologies find configurations with very large overdensities , consistent with singular density profiles  @xcite ( notice , however , that the simulations lack resolution to map the distribution of dm on the very small scales which are relevant for wimp signals ; at the same time , there is some tension between the simulation results and the dm profiles as derived from dynamical observations for certain classes of galaxies , see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the galactic center is an extraordinary site from several different points of view .",
    "dynamical observations point to the presence of a supermassive black hole  @xcite , with mass @xmath1 , located very close to the dynamical center of the galaxy , and most likely associated to the compact radio source labeled sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "infrared and x - ray counterparts have been identified for sgr  a@xmath0 ; gev and tev emissions in the direction of the gc have been detected as well , with the first data with high statistics and fair angular resolution which have been obtained with the hess air cherenkov telescope  @xcite .",
    "sgr  a@xmath0 is an unusual source , certainly very different from typical galactic or extragalactic compact sources associated to black holes .",
    "most notably , under our perspective , it has a very low luminosity over the whole spectrum , at a level at which it is plausible that a wimp - induced component may be relevant .",
    "the emission associated to wimp annihilations is expected to extend from the radio band up to gamma - ray frequencies .",
    "the peak of the gamma - ray luminosity stands at the energy corresponding to a fraction ( say one - third to one - twentieth ) of the wimp mass , which is in turn in the few ( tens of ) gev  few tev range ; it is mostly associated to the chain of decays and/or hadronization processes initiated by two - body final state particles from wimp pair annihilations , leading to the production of neutral pions and their subsequent decays into two photons . in an analogous chain , with analogous efficiency ,",

    "accretion flows around supermassive black holes , they give rise to synchrotron emission covering radio frequencies up to , possibly , the x - ray band .",

    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "the radio to sub - mm emission from sgr  a@xmath0 is characterized by a very hard spectrum : the luminosity above @xmath2  ghz scales approximately as @xmath3 with @xmath4 and cut - off at about @xmath5  ghz ( a compilation of available data and a full list of references is given , e.g .. in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we will show that such features do not seem to be compatible with the synchrotron emission induced by wimp annihilations , not even with the observed flux reshaped by synchrotron self - absorption .",

    "the size shrinks proportionally to @xmath8 up to the measured value of 0.2  mas ( about 1  au in physical size ) at about 86  ghz  @xcite , possibly at the level of the intrinsic size of the source .",
    "we will show that , at radio frequencies , the angular size of a wimp - induced component is expected to be much larger than these apparent or intrinsic angular dimensions ; we find sizes for which it is actually interesting to compare with wide field images of the gc region rather than sgr  a@xmath0 alone . among the available surveys",

    "the evidence for a gc diffuse non - thermal source was enlighted in  @xcite .",
    "both of the maps have an angular resolution @xmath9 , thus hiding the spatial structure of the diffuse emission in the innermost region .",

    "we will show that a x  ray flux at the quiescent level detected by chandra can be obtained in the case of large wimp densities and large magnetic field ; moreover the source is predicted essentially as point  like , rather than the extended source seen by the chandra detector .",

    "@xcite , the authors argue that the improvement of the instrument angular resolution at multi - gev energies should be taken into account in the data analysis , and conclude that it is actually possible to exclude the identification of the egret source with sgr  a@xmath0 ; in the same paper it is suggested that the comparison to set constraints on wimp models should be with the diffuse background measured by egret in the gc region , rather than with the egret gc source .",
    "the detection of tev gamma - ray radiation from the gc has been reported by hess  @xcite .",
    "such a measurement has been confirmed , with a consistent spectrum , by magic  @xcite and supersedes previous results by cangaroo  @xcite and whipple  @xcite , whose significantly different spectra is likely due to a miscalibration of the detector and poorer statistics rather than variability of the source .",

    "hess has also reported the detection of a diffuse gamma - ray emission along the central 300  pc of the gc ridge , within about 0.8  degree in longitude and 0.3  degree in latitude with respect to the gc .",

    "we have presented a systematic , self - consistent study of the multi  wavelength emission due to wimp pair annihilations in the galactic center region .",
    "the wimp signal is expected to extend from the radio band up to gamma - ray frequencies .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity is mostly associated to the chain of decays and/or hadronization processes initiated by two - body annihilation channels , leading to the production of neutral pions and their subsequent decays into two photons . in analogous chains , and with comparable efficiencies , high - energy electrons and positrons",
    "are produced as well : emitted in a region with large magnetic fields , they give rise to synchrotron emission covering radio frequencies up to , possibly , the x - ray band .",
    "a minor role is also played by inverse compton scattering on the cosmic microwave background or starlight .    referring to a generic wimp dm scenario , we have discussed spectral and angular features , and sketched the correlations among signals in the different energy bands .",
    "we have illustrated which are the critical assumptions in deriving such conclusions , starting from uncertainties in the dm source functions , regarding both wimp models and dm distributions , up to the modeling of propagation for electrons and positrons , and the assumptions on magnetic field profiles .",
    "we have introduced benchmark cases to guide the discussion and extracted the most relevant general trends : radio to mm synchrotron emission is essentially independent from the shape of the magnetic field in the innermost region of the galaxy , while at shorter wavelengths , i.e. in the infrared and , especially , the x  ray band , a different choice for the magnetic field may change predictions dramatically .",
    "radio signals have in general very large angular sizes , larger than the typical size for the source function and hence of the @xmath18-ray signals .",
    "the size of the region of synchrotron x - ray emissivity shrinks dramatically going to larger frequencies , smaller wimp masses , or softer annihilation channels .",
    "the luminosity of the wimp source at the different frequencies , and especially comparing the radio to the @xmath18-ray band , is essentially at a comparable level , with luminosity ratios depending rather weakly on wimp mass and annihilation channels .",
    "this is interesting , since the gc astrophysical source sgr  a@xmath0 , an unusual source , certainly very different from typical galactic or extragalactic compact sources associated to black holes , has a very low luminosity over the whole spectrum , at a level at which it is plausible that a wimp - induced component may be relevant . indeed , after a closer look , one sees that none of the fluxes detected in gc direction has spectral or angular features typical of a dm source , still all data - sets contribute to place significant constraints on the wimp parameter space .",
    "we have found that , although the @xmath18-ray band is the regime in which it is most straightforward to make the connection between a given dark matter model and the induced signal ( hence it is also the regime on which most of previous analyses have concentrated on ) , it does not seem to be the energy range with the best signal to background ratios . in the case of large magnetic fields close to the gc , x - ray data can give much tighter constraints .",
    "radio and nir measurements , which are less model dependent , tend to be more constraining as well .    regarding an outlook for the future",
    ", we have explored the capability of improving @xmath18-ray constraints on wimp models of the glast satellite telescope , and of cta as representative of the next generation of air cherenkov telescopes .",
    "the recent discovery of a @xmath18-ray gc source and of a diffuse @xmath18ray component , however , limits the possibility of dramatic improvements , possibly reducing the region in the parameter space accessible to @xmath18-ray telescopes to regimes that , within the range of assumptions listed in our analysis , are already excluded at other wavelengths . on the other hand ,",
    "if the sgr  a source has a size in the radio band which is not significantly larger than its presently estimated value , future wide field radio observations could be a new effective way to test wimp dm models .    , but taking @xmath96 as the dominant annihilation channel.,width=294 ]       , but taking @xmath96 as the dominant annihilation channel.,width=294 ]",
