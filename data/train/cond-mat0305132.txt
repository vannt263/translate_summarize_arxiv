    "a variety of methods have been used to study diffusion - controlled reactions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) ranging from simplest pair - like or smoluchowskii approach  @xcite towards more sophisticated methods such as many particle density function formalism  @xcite and field theory  @xcite . in here",
    ", we focus on the field theory approach which is exact but , like in any other theory , one needs approximations to solve the problem .",
    "the particular way of making approximate calculations will be analyzed , the bogolyubov s theory of weakly non - ideal bose gas  @xcite , to be referred to in the following as weakly non - ideal bose gas approximation ( wbga ) .",
    "the field theory is very attractive since it offers systematic way to do calculation and there are well known procedures how to represent stochastic dynamics of reaction - diffusion systems as field theory .",
    "such mapping can be carried out for lattice- and off - lattice models , see @xcite and @xcite respectively for description .",
    "final result is that the dynamics is governed by a second quantized hamiltonian @xmath5 , @xmath6 and system configuration at time @xmath7 can be extracted from state vector @xmath8 .",
    "all observables can be expressed as a field theoretic averages over products of creation and annihilation operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "there is no need whatsoever to resort to the use of field theory as all calculations could be done without it .",
    "the reasons for using it are mostly practical .",
    "field theory is a powerful book - keeping device .",
    "first , approximations involved can be made more transparent and , second , due to this transparency it is relatively straightforward to borrow approximations from other problems ( and related forms of field theory ) .",
    "however , despite its elegance , when applied to the reaction - diffusion systems , field theory seems to work with limited success .",
    "most often the only practical procedure of solving field theory is perturbative calculation .",
    "diffusion is set up as the zeroth order problem and reaction is perturbation .",
    "problem is that in the most interesting regime , when dimension of the system is low ( bellow some critical dimension ) , perturbation series diverges due to infra - red divergences .",
    "any non - field theoretic approach which aims at perturbative treatment will suffer in a similar way .",
    "the infra - read divergences are normally controlled in the framework of the renormalization group ( rg ) technique .",
    "when applying rg , the initial density is relevant parameter and grows under renormalization process .",
    "growing initial densities lead to infinities in expressions which have to be controlled .",
    "so far , such control exists only in the limited amount of cases , the a+a reaction being the simplest example .",
    "clearly , there is a need to avoid perturbative treatment ( together with rg ) and look for alternative ways of calculation . in here , focus is on the wbga .",
    "the wbga was used to study reaction - diffusion systems previously  @xcite . in somewhat technical terms",
    ", the basic idea behind wbga is to neglect the products containing three or higher number of annihilation operators having non - zero wave vector in the hamiltonian .",
    "this procedure leads to closed set of equations for particle density and correlation functions . solving these equations amounts to resummation of infinite series of diagrams . in this way",
    "wbga appears as a non - perturbative technique which can be used to control infra - red divergences of perturbation series . in the following , we will distinguish between two types of approximations to be refereed to as wbga - i or wbga - ii which result in linear or nonlinear set of equations of motion respectively .    on the more intuitive basis , the neglect of fluctuations on the shorter length scale ( large @xmath11 vectors ) has to do with the slowness of diffusion . for initial conditions when particle density is uniform",
    "there is no @xmath12 component in average particle density and the density profile is flat .",
    "since diffusion is a very slow process one expects that this profile is kept all the time up to a small perturbation .",
    "this picture is likely to be true when particle density is low when compared to the reaction range , which is summarized in the condition that @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the particle density and the reaction range  @xcite .",
    "naturally , there are other scales in the problem ( which change in time ) and this kind of thinking can not be employed without encountering problems  @xcite . in reality",
    ", one really has to test the wbga on the particular model to see whether it works .    to analyze properties of the wbga method",
    ", we apply it in the analysis of three diffusion - controlled reactions ( i ) the a+a , ( ii ) the a+b and ( iii ) the abba model .",
    "the abba model includes a+a , a+b and b+b reactions simultaneously which allows for competitions between a+a and a+b reactions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the a+a and a+b models have been studied by variety of methods ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) . in here , the focus is on the wbga studies .",
    "apart from few initial studies of the a+a and a+b models the wbga have not been widely used .",
    "these early applications of wbga on a+a and a+b reaction - diffusion systems are mostly done for stationary situation ( and decay from it ) and are listed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( a+a ) and @xcite ( a+b ) .",
    "also , the wbga reappears in paper  @xcite where it is used to study the a+b reaction .",
    "the purpose of this work is twofold .",
    "first , we study a+a and a+b reactions with uncorrelated initial conditions with particles poisson - distributed  @xcite at initial time @xmath16 . in previous work which employed wbga method in refs .  @xcite it was assumed that particles are initially correlated , with a initial condition being prepared in a somewhat special way  @xcite .",
    "second , once the workings of the wbga approximation is illuminated , we apply the wbga method to analyze the more complicated abba model .",
    "this model was studied previously with field theoretic rg technique using @xmath17-expansion and numerical simulation  @xcite .",
    "the abba model describes a mixture of the a+a and a+b reactions which occur at the same time .",
    "the a+a ( a+b ) component bias kinetics towards @xmath18 ( @xmath3 ) decay exponent and it is not a priori clear which exponent will prevail .",
    "the analysis in  @xcite shows that both a and b particles decay with @xmath18 decay exponent and different amplitudes .",
    "the a+a model has been studied by variety of methods and lot is know about it s behavior .",
    "the study most relevant for this work is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for uncorrelated initial conditions particle density",
    "@xmath14 decays asymptotically as @xmath19 for @xmath20 while there is logarithmic correction at @xmath21 as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes dimension of system , @xmath7 is time and @xmath24 denotes diffusion constant .",
    "amplitude @xmath25 is universal number independent on the details of the model . also , the exact solution of the model is possible at @xmath26 where @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 decay exponent of the a+a reaction is robust in a sense that even simplest pair like approach ( e.g. smoluchowskii ) predicts this exponent .",
    "thus , it is natural to test wbga on the a+a model .",
    "it will be shown that , somewhat surprisingly , wbga fails to describe a+a reaction : wbga - i predicts @xmath3 decay exponent while wbga - ii gives mean field exponent .",
    "taking slightly more complicated reaction scheme , such as the a+b , leads to very hard problem where calculation methods start to differ in their predictions .",
    "the nature of the asymptotics of a+b reaction when initial number of a and b particles is equal has been hotly debated for decades .",
    "for example , smoluchowskii approach predicts @xmath18 decay exponent  @xcite .",
    "field theoretic rg method predicts correct @xmath3 decay for @xmath28  @xcite , while for other dimensions nothing can be said in the rg framework .",
    "strangely enough , seemingly the most sophisticated coupled - cluster technique argues for mean field exponent  @xcite .",
    "the true decay is governed by @xmath3 exponent as shown by work of bramson and lebowitz which provided strict mathematical proof  @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that when particles are initially uncorrelated , _",
    "i.e. _ poisson - distributed , both the wbga - i and wbga - ii predict @xmath3 decay exponent .",
    "strangely enough , wbga fails on simpler a+a reaction while it describes properly more complicated a+b reaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "the model to be studied is specified in detail , and mapping to the field theory is described .",
    "the outcome of this section is hamiltonian which describes the most general two species reaction - diffusion model . in section",
    "[ sec : eom ] equations of motion for density and correlation functions are derived using wbga method . in section [ sec : aa+wbga ] the wbga approach is used to describe a+a model , with application of wbga - i discussed in section [ sec : aa+wbgai ] , and application of wbga - ii in section [ sec : aa+wbgaii ] .",

    "the a+a , a+b and the abba model will be obtained as special cases .",
    "it will be assumed that particles can not be created , neither by external source , nor by birth process . in the most general version of the two species reaction - diffusion model each of the @xmath29 or @xmath30 particles jumps onto the one of the neighboring lattice sites with rate ( or diffusion constant ) @xmath31 or @xmath32 , irrespectively of occupation number of the site where particle jumps to .",
    "apart from diffusing particles annihilate in pairs .",
    "particle @xmath33 sitting at lattice site @xmath34 and particle @xmath35 sitting at the site @xmath36 are assumed to annihilate with rate @xmath37 .",

    "for example , the term describing a+a reaction at the same lattice site has the pre - factor @xmath56 while for two different sites another form @xmath57 has to be used .",
    "the master equation ( [ me ] ) is the first order differential equation and one has to specify initial condition in the form @xmath58 for all @xmath43 . in the following",
