    "defect induced magnetism is controversially discussed based on indications for ferromagnetism in oxides , nitrides , sulfides , and carbon based materials @xcite . graphite or graphene might be the most simple candidate of them , since it contains only one element , is structurally simple , and is rather inert .",
    "the theoretical prediction of interacting magnetic moments provided by vacancies @xcite and zig - zag edges @xcite fuels the hope that magnetic order can be achieved . however , experimental evidence for paramagnetism @xcite , ferromagnetism @xcite and antiferromagnetism @xcite in graphene and graphite appear to contradict each other , even though partly found by different experimental methods after different sample preparation .",
    "for example , early superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) measurements on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) found indications for ferro- or ferrimagnetism after irradiation with 2.25 mev protons even at room temperature @xcite .",
    "subsequent , more detailed investigations observed ferromagnetism also for n@xmath5- and c@xmath5-projectiles and indirectly concluded that the ferromagnetism requires a particular vacancy - vacancy distance of about 2 nm @xcite . the conclusion is based on srim calculations @xcite and the observation of some x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) features observed at 300 k , which imply near - surface magnetism @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a recent report on squid results studying graphene laminates after bombardment with 10@xmath6/m@xmath2 protons of kinetic energy of 350 - 400 kev or @xmath7/m@xmath2 c@xmath5 ions with kinetic energy of 20 mev finds only paramagnetic spin 1/2 centers down to 1.8 k @xcite , albeit the ion fluence and ion energy of c@xmath5 matches rather exactly the ones leading to ferromagnetism in hopg @xcite .",
    "it was further found , that the spin 1/2 centers come in two types distinct by their doping behaviour , which are probably caused by unsaturated @xmath8-type and @xmath9-type electrons , respectively @xcite . also thicker graphene samples ( 2 nm )",
    "vertically stacked on a si substrate did not show any magnetic hysteresis after 100 kev n@xmath1 bombardment up to ion densities of 10@xmath10/m@xmath2 and down to temperatures of 5 k @xcite .",
    "one drawback of these studies is that the damage caused by the ions is only estimated by srim simulations @xcite , which ignore the crystalline structure of the honeycomb lattice and any type of annealing either caused by temperature or by subsequent ions .",
    "for example , the number of paramagnetic centers deduced by squid was only about 10 % of the calculated ion induced vacancies @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a clear fingerprint of paramagnetic vacancies in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has been reported , which is a peak in the local density of states ( ldos ) close to the dirac point @xmath11 @xcite , which according to tight binding calculations persists up to vacancy densities of 5 % @xcite .",
    "a peak at @xmath11 has also been found after dilute h adsorption , e.g. in density functional theory calculations @xcite or in stm experiments @xcite , again indicating paramagnetic behavior . + here , we combine stm and electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements on the same monolayer graphene samples after low energy ion bombardment .",
    "esr has the advantage with respect to squid that it can distinguish between different magnetic impurities by their @xmath3-factor and their hyperfine interaction .",
    "thus , esr is much less prone to unwanted ferromagnetic inclusions than squid .",
    "esr has been applied previously to graphene samples as exfoliated graphene including monolayers on scotch tape @xcite , reduced graphene oxide @xcite , or gas phase produced graphene platelets @xcite .",
    "defects were present in all samples as deduced from the esr signals , but their origin and type remains unknown .",
    "esr has also been applied to different nanographitic structures with rather uncontrolled thickness distributions , where signals are interpreted in terms of vacancies , edge states and itinerant electrons @xcite , but again the origin and type of the defects was unknown .",
    "recently the first electrically detected esr study on heavily doped graphene on sic has been published @xcite revealing a contrast in conductivity @xmath12 of about 0.5 % for the conduction electrons , which was used to pinpoint the strength of valley splitting in graphene on sic .",
    "+ thus , neither an esr study of graphene after controlled introduction of defects nor a study combining scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) and esr has been published previously . here , we provide such a study .",
    "+ firstly , we argue that the ion bombardment produces single vacancies within the graphene .",
    "the arguments are as follows :    * the ions do not have enough energy to produce a second vacancy , if the displacement energy calculated by density functional theory ( dft ) is correct @xcite . *",
    "the defect yield observed by stm is @xmath13 as expected from srim , thus much lower than one implying that only a fracture of the ions displaces c atoms .",
    "this makes it very unlikely that two c atoms are displaced in one ion impact event .",
    "* vacancies in graphene do not move at room temperature according to a recent transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) study @xcite in accordance with results from dft @xcite . *",
    "the defects show a ldos peak close to the dirac point @xmath14 , which is expected for single vacancies @xcite , but not for vacancy agglomerates @xcite .    secondly , we find that the defect - related ldos peak close to @xmath14 , which is consistent with a paramagnetic behavior of the vacancy @xcite , survives exposure to air for about 3 hours , such that the transfer to the esr setup does not destroy this characteristic spectroscopic feature .",
    "consequently , ldos peaks observed close to @xmath15 can be correlated to the esr signal .",
    "thirdly , we perform esr on the graphene with vacancies , which exhibits a peak corresponding to a @xmath3-factor of about 2.002 . a small anisotropy of the resulting @xmath3-factor between in - plane and out - of - plane magnetic fields ( 0.02% ) has been found , which might be helpful to identify the @xmath8 or @xmath9 character of the paramagnetic spins .",
    "the narrow esr linewidth of 0.2 mt at a spin density of @xmath4/nm@xmath2 indicates a significant exchange narrowing and , indeed , by temperature dependent esr measurements , we find that the vacancies are correlated antiferromagnetically , i.e. the curie - weiss temperature is about -10 k. this rules out ferromagnetism in graphene at ion induced spin densities of @xmath4/nm@xmath2 . +    [ t ! ]",

    "+ the samples are transferred to the esr setup within a sealed glass tube which has been cleaned by rinsing in hcl , deionized water , and acetone as well as an ar plasma discharge .",
    "afterwards , the samples are taken out of uhv , are mounted to the quartz glass based esr sample holders , contacted by wire bonding and put into the glass tube , which is evacuated to @xmath27 pa before being filled with ar gas . at the esr setup",

    "a migration of the vacancies into vacancy clusters is also unlikely , since the migration barrier for vacancies as deduced from dft is @xmath49 ev @xcite implying that the vacancies are immobile at room temperature , e.g. yielding a hopping rate of @xmath50/s assuming a reasonable attempt frequency @xmath51/s ( @xmath52 : boltzmann constant ) . in line",

    "the @xmath23 curve away from the defects ( blue curve in fig . [ fig1](b ) ) shows a minimum close to @xmath54 indicating minimal doping by the ion bombardment , i.e. @xmath55 with the fermi level @xmath54 .",
    "+ the peaks at @xmath14 are additional evidence that the defects are single vacancies , i.e. tight - binding calculations and previous stm results allow to identify single vacancies by a peak at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "thereby , the calculated vacancy induced peak at @xmath14 remains largely unchanged up to 0.5 vacancies / nm@xmath2 and gets hybridized only at a density above 2 vacancies / nm@xmath2 , which is more than three orders of magnitude larger than in the experiment of fig .",

    "thus , the only reasonable explanation for the peak at @xmath11 is a single vacancy produced by ion bombardment . +   + using this sample , we tested the development of the defects under air exposure .",

    "the stm image features a double tip , i.e all defects are accompanied by a fainter ghost image at the upper left .",
    "however , this does not influence the spectroscopic characterization , since the two features of the double tip are spatially well separated , i.e. the double tip only mixes contributions from clean graphene into the spectra on the defects .",
    "figure [ fig1](g ) and ( h ) show the same data after 3 hours of air exposure .",
    "the average peak value and average peak width are -10 mv ( -20 mv ) and 130 mv ( 140 mv ) after 10 min ( 3 hours ) with the same rms fluctuations as prior to the air exposure .",
    "thus , the peak gets slightly broadened by air exposure , but remains close to @xmath54 indicating the persistence of paramagnetic properties .",
    "the fact that the peak gets slightly broader on average is probably caused by the onset of an interaction with adsorbates from air .",
    "this is in line with the observation that extensive air exposure also broadens the esr line ( see below ) . a speculation , which type of adsorbate is responsible for the slight broadening is beyond the scope of this manuscript .",
    "importantly , we find that the spectral change of the defect is minor such that defects characterized by peaks in the local density of states close to @xmath11 , being most likely reconstructed single vacancies , can be probed by esr even after short term transfer through air",

    "the corrugation exhibits a rms roughness of 390 pm .",
    "the @xmath23 spectroscopy [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] shows a rather linear increase on the hole and on the electron side with interception around @xmath57 mv revealing that the sample is barely doped . after ion bombardment [ fig . [ fig2](c),(d ) ] , the additional white bumps indicate the ion induced defects .",
    "such bumps have been observed previously on graphene on sic and sio@xmath0 after ion bombardment at higher energy @xcite .",
    "counting the defects on the graphene sample is not very reliable due to the additional contrast of the rippling and the folds . at low fluence [ fig . [ fig2](c ) ] , we estimate a yield of about @xmath47 defects / ion very similar to the one obtained for hopg . based on the same arguments as for hopg ,",
    "we conclude that the majority of the defects are single vacancies .",
    "notice that md simulations exclusively find single vacancies after ar@xmath1 bombardment at 50 ev of monolayer graphene @xcite and again that the tem data imply that the single vacancies are immobile @xcite .",
    "indeed , the defects exhibit a peak in @xmath23 spectroscopy exclusively around @xmath54 up to ion fluences of 1/(nm@xmath2 ) as expected for single vacancies [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](e),(f ) ] . at fluences",
    "higher than 1/nm@xmath2 , it gets difficult to spot areas without @xmath23 peaks .",
    "the averaged peak position ( 16 spectra ) is @xmath58 mv with a peak to peak variation of 50 mv@xmath59 .",
    "the fwhm of the peak is @xmath60 mv with a rms fluctuation of 50 mv .",
    "thus , the defects are very similar to the ones observed on hopg ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the rms fluctuation in peak position is slightly stronger on graphene , which might be related either to the rippling or to the more inhomogeneous electrostatic environment of the graphene sample . the dirac point corresponding to the minimum of the @xmath23 curves recorded away from the defects barely shifts again indicating negligible doping by ion bombardment .",
    "+      in this section , the key results obtained on the samples characterized by stm are described .",
    "since dft also predicts a magnetic moment of @xmath61 for a single vacancy after jahn - teller distortion @xcite accompanied by the ldos peak at @xmath62 @xcite , the magnetic moment should be observable in esr experiments .",
    "such measurements are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as recorded at @xmath63 ghz in the derivative mode .",

    "spectra at low fluence did not show any additional signatures .",
    "for an ion fluence of 10/nm@xmath2 [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] , we find an additional narrow esr line corresponding to @xmath64 as expected for graphene vacancies @xcite .",
    "the apparent line width can be determined from a fit , which is optimal , if a mixture of a gaussian and a lorentzian of similar strength are used .",
    "fit curves of pure gaussian and pure lorentzian type are shown in comparison to the mixed fit in fig . [",
    "fig3](c ) .",
    "while the lorentzian fit deviates at low magnetic field from the experimental data , the gaussian fit deviates at high magnetic field , which can be both compensated by the mixture ( gauss./lorentz .",
    "this indicates that both , broadening due to inhomogeneities of the local @xmath3-factor and anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction ( gaussian ) as well as exchange narrowing ( lorentzian ) contribute to the line width .",
    "the latter one means that the isotropic exchange between the electrons averages the local fields from neighboring spins , which results in a narrowing of the line width , which then partly exhibits the lorentzian shape due to the finite lifetime ( see also below ) .",
    "the apparent width of the peak , i.e. the distance between the minimum and the maximum of the fitted derivative curve , is 0.18 mt .",

    "a detailed investigation on the origin of the linewidth broadening is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "it might be that some of the spins are quenched by interaction with adsorbates or by recombination with nearby vacancies leading to a reduced exchange narrowing ( see below ) and/or to an increased inhomogeneity of the local g - factor .",

    "+ the self - healing might be explained as follows .",
    "the small average distance between defects of @xmath115 nm leads to the formation of divacancies lacking a magnetic moment , since the energy gain in divacancy formation is more than 3 ev per vacancy according to dft @xcite .",

    "moreover , dft finds that the so - called 585 reconstruction of a divacancy exhibits a spin @xmath116 and a ldos peak at @xmath117 ev @xcite .",
    "indeed , we occasionally observe @xmath23 peaks around -0.2 ev on the graphene surface after ar@xmath1 bombardment with fluence 10/nm@xmath2 .",
    "+ notice finally , that dft predicts antiferromagnetic order between vacancies on different sublattices and ferromagnetic order between vacancies on the same sublattice @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model implies a significantly stronger antiferromagnetic coupling by superexchange between different sublattices than the ferromagnetic coupling by direct exchange on the same sublattice @xcite .",
    "the superexchange for small distances ( @xmath118 lattice sites ) is also much larger than the exchange via rkky interaction reaching about @xmath119 mev at a distance of 5 lattice sites @xcite .",
    "thus , the experimentally found preferential antiferromagnetic correlations between vacancies are in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "however , the calculated interaction would lead to much higher curie - weiss temperatures , at least , if the compensating effects of the ferromagnetic interactions and the disorder are not taken into account .",
    "this calls for more detailed investigations also from the theoretical side .",
    "+     as a function of ion fluence measured at 300 k , width=264 ]      finally , we comment on our attempt to measure changes of the sample conductivity during @xmath120-wave exposure in changing @xmath32-field aiming for edsr .",
    "while the sheet resistance @xmath121 of graphene increases with increasing ion fluence @xmath122 up to 3.5 g@xmath18 ( slope @xmath123 ) [ [ fig4 ] ] ( see also @xcite ) , we do not detect a relative current change by applying the same oscillating @xmath32 field as in the esr experiments of fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , down to @xmath124 with @xmath125 being the applied current and @xmath126 the amplitude of the current change .",
    "this implies that the spin orientation of the single vacancies is not relevant for transport .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a combined study of electron spin resonance and scanning tunneling spectroscopy on the same graphene samples after low energy ion bombardment .",
    "we detect the ldos peak close to the dirac point indicative of paramagnetic single vacancies , which persists air exposure up to 3 hours .",
    "electron spin resonance data exhibit a resonance line close to @xmath127 with an anisotropy of 0.02 % only . a curie - weiss - type temperature dependence with a curie - weiss temperature of about -10 k proofs the existence of preferential antiferromagnetic correlations at defect densities of @xmath4/nm@xmath2 .",
    "this excludes ferromagnetism even at low temperature .",
    "we regard these results as an important step towards a more controlled investigation of defect induced magnetism in graphene .",
    "moreover , these samples might be a good benchmark for open questions concerning esr - stm measurements @xcite .",
