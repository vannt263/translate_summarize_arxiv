    "classical cepheids are fundamental standard candles to determine both galactic and extragalactic distances .",

    "this means that they can also be adopted to provide robust absolute calibrations of secondary distance indicators , and in turn to estimate the value of the hubble constant ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the accuracy reached in the determination of cosmological parameters using the cepheid distance scale relies on the knowledge of the physical mechanisms that govern their radial oscillations and on their dependence on intrinsic parameters ( luminosity , mass , radius , chemical composition ; see e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the estimate of cepheid radii and of the effective temperature ( using mean intrinsic colours ) allows us to constrain their intrinsic luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the cepheid mass can be estimated by adopting a period  mass  radius relation ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and in turn to provide independent constraints on the mass - luminosity relations .",
    "the methods currently used to derive cepheid radii from photometric and spectroscopic data ( radial velocity ) are based on the classical baade  wesselink technique @xcite . among them , the surface brightness technique @xcite and the cors method @xcite rely on solid physical bases .",
    "the reader interested in a detailed discussion concerning the different baade  wesselink methods is referred to @xcite .",

    " wesselink methods can be applied to large samples of cepheids and it has been recently extended to magellanic cepheids @xcite . however , the precision of baade  wesselink distances strongly depends on the quality of photometric and radial velocity data .    in a previous paper @xcite , we adapted the cors method to derive cepheid radii observed in the strmgren system .",
    "however the model atmospheres adopted in the quoted investigation to estimate the surface brightness did not allow us to include cepheids with periods longer than 1213 days .",
    "the cutoff in the long period range limited the accuracy of the period  radius relation .",
    "recently , @xcite provided new calibrations based on a new release of model atmospheres by @xcite for the walraven photometry of galactic cepheids originally collected by @xcite .",
    "the walraven system includes five bands , ( v , b , l , u , w ) , designed to measure the features of hydrogen spectrum .",

    "we show that this new calibration of the vbluw cepheid time series data by @xcite allows us to derive precise stellar parameters ( surface gravity and effective temperature ) at fixed chemical composition and to calibrate with high accuracy the surface brightness function , a fundamental ingredient for the application of the baade  wesselink method .",
    "this opportunity stimulated us to apply the cors version of the baade ",
