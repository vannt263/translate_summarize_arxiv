    "recently the atlas and cms collaborations have announced the discovery of a new boson with the approximate mass of 125 gev , and suggested that this might be the long sought higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "if this is confirmed by future data , it will be extremely important to accurately measure the higgs coupling to the particles of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings are of particular importance , because of the role they play in the unitarization of longitudinal weak boson scattering amplitudes . recall that for a given @xmath6 scattering amplitude @xmath7 the @xmath8-th partial wave projection is defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the cosine of the scattering angle , and @xmath11 is the @xmath8-th legendre polynomial . for any value of @xmath8 , unitarity demands @xmath12 to lie on a unit circle centered on @xmath13 , the argand circle .",
    "in particular this implies the bounds @xmath14 consider for instance the @xmath15 scattering . at large values of the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy",
    "the amplitude grows like @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electroweak vev , @xmath18 gev , and @xmath19 if @xmath20 is well below one , for instance , the @xmath21 projection undergoes unitarity loss at a few tevs  @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , new particles , not heavier than a few tevs , must come into play and unitarize the amplitude .",
    "it is often assumed that a light higgs boson is associated with perturbative dynamics .",
    "this implies that , at high energy , the partial wave projections of the longitudinal weak boson scattering amplitudes have a real part approaching a small and constant value , far from the unitarity bounds of eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitbound ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the imaginary part of an amplitude is due to loop corrections , which , in a perturbative regime , are small .",
    "thus in order for the @xmath12 projections to lie on the argand circle , also the real part has to be small .",
    "therefore , the terms growing like @xmath22 must vanish . if @xmath23 , this implies that new states must supply the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wwh ] ) , @xmath24 in such a way that the coefficient of the term growing like @xmath22 vanishes : @xmath25 this , for example , is the scenario conjectured in  @xcite and  @xcite .    despite the common lore",
    ", we believe it possible for a light higgs to coexist with strong dynamics at the unitarization scale .",
    "this occurs if the higgs boson is a composite scalar of new strong dynamics , technicolor ( tc ) , which is responsible for breaking the electroweak symmetry .",
    "naively the natural mass scale for the lightest tc scalar singlet is of the order of 1 tev , as obtained by scaling up the lightest scalar isosinglet of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) , the @xmath26 meson .",
    "however , in viable tc theories naive qcd scaling - up does not hold , as there are additional mechanisms which lead to a large suppression of the mass of the lightest scalar , relative to the naive estimate .",
    "first , viable tc theories are expected to be near - conformal in a range of energies above the chiral symmetry breaking scale . to see this , recall that the sm fermions acquire mass by interacting with the tc vacuum through a spontaneously broken gauge interaction , extended technicolor ( etc )  @xcite .",
    "this , however , introduces unwanted flavor - changing neutral currents , which can only be eliminated by raising the mass of the etc gauge bosons .",
    "doing so would result in unacceptably small sm fermion masses , unless the tc vacuum is enhanced , from the tc to the etc scale , by near - conformal dynamics and a large anomalous dimension of the tc vacuum  @xcite .",
    "if tc dynamics feel the presence of a nearby fixed point , the mass of the lightest scalar is expected to be reduced , relative to a qcd - like spectrum .",
    "the reason for this is that tc theories with a spontaneously broken scale invariance are expected to feature a massless scalar singlet in the spectrum , the technidilaton  @xcite . in asymptotically - free tc theories",
    "scale invariance is only approximate , and the technidilatonic higgs boson is expected to acquire a small dynamical mass  @xcite . by small we mean smaller than the natural mass scale of the light technihadrons , which is of the order of 1 tev .",
    "second , the higgs mass in tc , as well as in the sm , is modified by radiative corrections due to gauge interactions and etc - induced yukawa interactions . as in the sm , in tc",
    "the radiative corrections to the higgs mass are quadratic in the cutoff . however , unlike the sm , a theory of technihadrons has a physical cutoff , the scale of compositeness .",
    "the latter is estimated to be of the order of @xmath27  @xcite , where @xmath28 is the `` technipion '' decay constant , analogous to the pion decay constant of qcd .",
    "if the fermionic sector of tc consists of @xmath29 weak `` technidoublets '' , each contributing an equal amount to @xmath30 , then @xmath31 .",
    "since the cutoff is physical , the cutoff - dependence of the radiative corrections to the higgs mass is also physical , and , being quadratic , large .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath32 is negative : it arises from the top loop , and is of the order of @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "finally , the tc higgs can become lighter by `` geometric scaling '' , as the number of technicolors and/or weak technidoublets is increased .",
    "the tc states become lighter as @xmath29 increases because , as mentioned in the last paragraph , the square of the electroweak vev receives contribution from @xmath29 weak pairs .",
    "if @xmath17 is to be kept fixed at 246 gev , this forces the whole tc spectrum to scale like @xmath34 .",
    "the scaling as a function of the number of technicolors , @xmath35 , is much more subtle .",
    "the large-@xmath35 limit of @xmath36 was first obtained by t - hooft with technifermions in the fundamental representation  @xcite .",
    "this allows rescaling from qcd , which corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "corrigan and ramond noted that scaling - up qcd is also possible with technifermions in the two - index antisymmetric representation , as the latter coincides with the anti - fundamental representation for @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the t hooft and corrigan - ramond large-@xmath35 limits lead to qualitatively very different spectra .",
    "in particular , only @xmath38 scalars , in the t hoof limit , with @xmath17 fixed at 246 gev , become lighter at large values of @xmath35 , whereas multiquark states do not exist at @xmath39 . on the other hand , in the corrigan - ramond limit scalar masses are always expected to scale down like @xmath40 .",
    "large @xmath35 scaling can be obtained for other higher - dimensional representations , even though a comparison with qcd is no longer possible .",
    "for instance , in the two - index symmetric representation scalars masses are expected to scale like @xmath41 , in the large @xmath35 limit  @xcite .    for strongly coupled dynamics at the unitarization scale ,",
    "we neither expect sum rules like the one of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) to hold , nor the partial wave projections of longitudinal weak boson scattering amplitudes to have a small real part .",
    "instead , we expect the latter to quickly grow ( with either an overall plus or minus sign ) and oscillate between the unitarity bounds -1/2 and 1/2 .",
    "this is indeed the scenario of pion - pion scattering in qcd  @xcite . because of this , in models with strong unitarization we expect enhancement of @xmath42 processes at the lhc , where each @xmath1 denotes either a @xmath2 or a @xmath3 boson  @xcite .",
    "here we analyze this in the context of near - conformal tc , with a light composite higgs in the spectrum , and vector meson dominance ( vmd ) .",
    "the interesting aspect of this analysis is that it allows to probe tc for masses and coupling of the spin - one resonances lying outside the lhc reach for significant production through drell - yan ( dy ) processes .",
    "in fact in models of vmd the coupling of the light sm fermions to the spin - one technimesons is suppressed by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the weak coupling and @xmath45 is the spin - one technimeson coupling . thus increasing @xmath45 reduces sensitivity to dy production  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , increasing @xmath45 does not lead to a reduction of the cross section for @xmath42 , as the partial wave projections of longitudinal weak boson scattering amplitudes are always expected to oscillate between -1/2 and 1/2 .",
    "furthermore , dy production of spin - one technimesons becomes increasingly kinematically forbidden as the latter become heavier . on the other hand , in @xmath42 processes the strength of the amplitude does not decrease as the technimeson masses become larger .",
    "in fact the technimesons are expected to unitarize the weak boson scattering amplitudes , no matter what their mass is .",
    "our goal is therefore to show that the discovery of tc through @xmath42 processes is complementary to dy production of spin - one technimesons .",
    "the remainder of this note is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : unit ] we review aspects of unitarity of longitudinal weak boson scattering in near - conformal tc , with a light higgs and a technirho isospin triplet unitarizing the amplitudes . in sec.[sec : vector ] we analyze the @xmath42 processes at the lhc , and the potential for discovery of near - conformal tc . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we offer our conclusions .",
    "the model we use as a template for our analysis is near - conformal tc with an @xmath46 chiral symmetry breaking pattern . by gauging the electroweak subgroup of @xmath47",
    "this becomes a model of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the near conformal behavior of the underlying gauge theory is reflected , in the effective theory , by the presence of a light higgs , which we choose to take as the chiral partner of the technipions eaten by the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons , and by a near degenerate set of spin - one vector and axial - vector isotriplets .",

    "we actually find the signal for the @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 channels to increase with @xmath45 and @xmath97 ( @xmath97 is the mass of the spin - one axial triplet , which , being near degenerate with the mass of the spin - one vector triplet @xmath96 , can be conveniently used to parametrize the overall mass of the lightest states in the tc spin - one sector ) .",
    "this shows that tc searches in @xmath0 channels are complementary to dy searches , which are most effective at small values of @xmath45 and @xmath97 .",
    "our results are summarized in  tab .",
    "[ tab : pbsm ] , in which we show the probability of excluding the sm at the 95% c.l .",
    ", for different near - conformal tc scenarios ( different values of @xmath45 and @xmath97 ) , and different integrated luminosities .",
    "for instance , if the tc scenario with @xmath107 tev and @xmath149 is realized in nature , then the lhc will be able to exclude the sm , with a 77% probability , at the 95% c.l .",
    ", already for 50 @xmath144 of integrated luminosity .",
    "our analysis includes leptonic decays only , and can therefore be improved by including additional decay modes for the weak bosons .",
    "the analysis can also be refined by investigating a larger set of points in the parameter space .",
    "the reach of this analysis goes to regions of the parameter space inaccessible to the usual dy production of resonances and is therefore an important tool for probing this type of theory .",
