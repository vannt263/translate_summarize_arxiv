    "the atlas experiment is one of two general - purpose collider detectors for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "the atlas detector consists of an inner detector employing silicon pixel , strip , and transition radiation tracking detectors , all in a solenoidal magnetic field of 2 tesla ; electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters using liquid argon and scintillator tile detectors ; and a muon spectrometer .",
    "the muon spectrometer consists of a large air - core barrel and endcap toroid magnets with a typical field of 1 tesla , and four types of trigger and precision tracking detectors , described below .",
    "the spectrometer is designed to measure the transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) of muons with @xmath2 gev with a resolution of 3% for @xmath3 gev and increasing to 10% @ 1 tev .",
    "this paper describes the commissioning of the atlas muon detector for the first lhc collisions which are expected in fall , 2009 .",
    "the atlas muon spectrometer consists of monitored drift tubes ( mdts ) for precision tracking in the spectrometer bending plane , resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) and thin gap chambers ( tgcs ) for triggering in barrel and endcap , respectively , and cathode strip chambers ( cscs ) for precision measurements in the high - rate endcap inner layer where mdts would have occupancy problems .",
    "the magnet system consists of 3 sets of air - core toroids , each with 8 coils , 1 for the barrel , and 1 for each endcap .",
    "the barrel toroids coils are each 25 m @xmath4 7 m and the endcap coils are 9 m @xmath4 4 m .",
    "the magnetic field provides an approximately 1 t field at the center of each coils , but is rather non - uniform , especially in the barrel - endcap transition region . for track reconstruction , the field",
    "is mapped using computer models of the field which are normalized to measurements from 1850 hall sensors mounted on spectrometer chambers .",
    "figure [ fig : magnetic_field ] shows the @xmath5 of the spectrometer magnetic field .",
    "alignment measurements of the spectrometer are also critical for momentum determination and are accomplished with an optical alignment system of 12k sensors .",
    "measurements from these sensors allow a 3 dimensional reconstruction of chamber positions accurate to better than 50 @xmath6 m .",

    "studies of track reconstruction in mdts show that the efficiency of reconstruction of track segments within chambers is @xmath10 .",
    "this efficiency was determined extrapolating tracks reconstructed from 2 chambers to a @xmath11 chamber traversed by the track and then checking for a segment matching the incident track .",

    "= 12,14 for atlas support structures are clearly visible.,width=302 ]    mdts require calibrations to determine a timing offset ( @xmath12 ) , and a time - to - space function ( rt function ) . these calibrations will be performed with a special data stream from the level-2 trigger which will deliver up to @xmath13 the regular rate of single muons to provide high statistics for calibrations .",
    "this data stream will be processed at 3 off - site calibration centers in rome , munich , and michigan .",
    "the @xmath12 s are determined by fitting the rising edge of the drift time spectrum with a fermi - dirac function as shown in figure [ fig : tzero_fit ] .",
    "the rt function is determined by an autocalibration technique minimizing track residuals using either chamber data , or data from an mdt monitoring chamber on the surface which samples the mdt gas .",
    "figure [ fig : residuals_radius ] shows an example of tracking residuals versus tube radius after rt auto - calibration .",
    "additional details about the atlas mdt calibration process are discussed in more detail in the dpf talk of s. mckee ( `` atlas great lakes tier-2 computing and muon calibration center commissioning '' ) and in @xcite .",
    "fit shown in red.,width=302 ]        figure [ fig : mdt_res ] shows the mdt resolution versus tube radius as measured with both cosmic rays and testbeam data@xcite .",
    "the resolution obtained with cosmic - ray data is poorer than that measured in testbeam data .",
    "the cosmic - ray resolution could be matched roughly by adding an additional jitter of about 2 ns to testbeam plot .",
    "the decrease in resolution for cosmic rays is due to the non - synchronous arrival of cosmic rays compared to the 25 ns beam clock which is used for clocking the drift time measurements .",
    "this cosmic - ray jitter is mostly removed with an event - by - event @xmath14 fitting procedure , but a residual jitter remains . we expect that with collision data we will be able to match the testbeam resolution .",
    "the atlas muon spectrometer has separate optical alignment systems for the barrel and endcap .",
    "these employ a network of sensors to provide a 3d reconstruction of detector positions , which are essential for the muon sagitta measurement , and therefore momentum measurement of muons .",
    "the endcap optical system has been validated by looking at the `` false '' sagitta of straight tracks ( i.e. with no magnetic field ) which pass through the 3 endcap wheels .",
    "a track is reconstructed by hits on the inner and outer wheels and a sagitta calculated relative to this track using hits from the middle wheel as shown in figure [ fig : sagitta_diagram ] .",
    "figure [ fig : endcap_align ] shows the sagitta distribution with and without the alignment corrections applied . without corrections , using nominal geometry , the sagitta distribution is broad and distorted . when alignment corrections are applied the distribution is centered on zero to within 15 @xmath6 m , ( i.e. no net sagitta , as expected for straight tracks ) with a much narrower and uniform shape . the width of the distribution is primarily due to multiple scattering which is relatively high in cosmic rays .",
    "figure [ fig : barrel_align ] shows sagitta measurements for barrel tracks , with and without alignment corrections . for the barrel the alignment corrections were derived from both optical sensors and straight tracks , since the optical system of the barrel only covers half of the chambers .",
    "the corrections from straight tracks work considerably better those from the barrel optical system , due to some limitations in the optical system which are being addressed by additional commissioning work .",
    "the alignment with tracks corrects the sagitta to within 30 @xmath6 m as required for optimal spectrometer performance , whereas the barrel optical system is currently only able to correct chamber positions to 100 - 200 @xmath6 m .",
    "the atlas muon system is nearly fully installed and tested in the atlas cavern .",
    "data from cosmic rays show that the detector is performing well with cosmic rays though a complete evaluation of detector performance will only be possible with collision data",
