    "in this work , we revisit the derivation of continuum model for step flow with elasticity on vicinal surfaces . the starting point is the burton - cabrera - frank ( bcf ) type models for step flow @xcite ; see @xcite for extensions to include elastic effects .",
    "these are mesoscopic models which track the position of each individual step ( and hence keep the discrete nature of the step fronts ) , while adopt a continuum approximation for the interactions of the steps with surrounding atoms of the thin film .",
    "the step motion is hence characterized by a system of odes .",
    "such models are widely used for crystal growth of thin films on substrates , with many scientific and engineering applications @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to rigorously understand the pde limit of such models .    to avoid unnecessary technical difficulties",
    ", we will study a periodic train of steps in this work .",
    "denote the step locations at time @xmath0 by @xmath1 , we assume that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a fixed length of the period . thus , only the step locations in one period @xmath4 are considered as degrees of freedom , see figure 1 for example .",
    "we denote the height of each step as @xmath5 , and thus the total height change across the @xmath6 steps in the period is given by @xmath7 .",
    "corresponding to the step locations , we define the height profile @xmath8 of the steps as @xmath9 moreover , @xmath8 can be further extended , consistent with the periodic assumption , such that @xmath10 for the continuum limit , we consider the step height @xmath11 or equivalently , the number of steps in one period @xmath12 .    in the pioneering work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , xiang considered a bcf type model which incorporates the elastic interaction as @xmath13 where @xmath14 s are the local chemical potential given by @xmath15 with the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the energy functional @xmath18 given by @xmath19 for the limit @xmath20 , xiang  @xcite asymptotically derived the corresponding continuum model @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the @xmath3-periodic hilbert transform : @xmath23 observe that for the particular choice of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , suggests to rescale @xmath0 to consider time scale of the order @xmath26 . moreover , the coefficients in front of the term @xmath27 and the term @xmath28 in the bracket scale as @xmath29 so they become higher order terms compared with the first one . as argued in @xcite , the term",
    "@xmath30 is the correction to the misfit elastic energy density due to the discrete nature of the stepped surface .",
    "although it is small compared to the leading - order term @xmath31 , it is comparable with the term @xmath32 , which comes from the broken bond elastic interaction between steps . when formally ignoring these terms with small @xmath29-dependent amplitude , the pde analysis for @xmath33 is easy because the operator @xmath34 is a negative operator .",
    "recently , motivated by the pde proposed by @xcite , dal maso , fonseca and leoni @xcite studied the weak solution of to be increasing as in @xcite , we take @xmath35 to be decreasing corresponding to physical interpretation of @xmath35 being the height of the vicinal surface , which is the same convention as @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath36 in terms of a variational inequality .",
    "note that all the coefficients in this pde are @xmath37 , unlike the pde .",
    "they validated analytically by verifying the positivity of @xmath38 .",
    "rather remarkably , they found an approximation problem and proved the limit of the solution to the approximation problem also satisfies the weak version of variational inequality , which is satisfied by strong solution .",
    "moreover , fonseca , leoni and lu @xcite obtained the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution .",
    "they applied rothe method and truncation method to carefully deal with the singularity term .",
    "our goal is to rigorously prove the continuum limit of bcf type models for step flow .",
    "while it would be nice to recover using the scaling considered in @xcite , it is quite challenging ( if not impossible ) since the pde involves two scales , correspond to the three terms on the right hand side : @xmath39 instead , we follow the scaling of the pde considered in @xcite .",
    "we will derive as the continuum limit from a slightly modified bcf type mesoscopic model : we consider the step - flow ode with a rescaled time , i.e. , @xmath40 with a modified chemical potential @xmath41 see section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the first term in @xmath14 comes from the misfit elastic interaction between the steps , which is an attractive interaction .",
    "the second and third terms come from the broken bond elastic interaction between steps , which are repulsive terms .",
    "different from xiang s chemical potential in @xcite , we choose the scaling so that the attractive and repulsive interactions have the same order as @xmath11 .",
    "we add the repulsive term @xmath42 to cancel a singularity from the first term , which seems to be necessary . moreover , to ease the mathematical derivation , we restrict the repulsive terms to the nearest neighbor , which is the dominant contribution .    our modified ode system , from both the view of chemical potential and free energy ,",
    "is balanced in order . therefore unlike the original ode systems which ( at least heuristically ) lead to a pde with multiple scales , our system converges to pde in the limit .",
    "we are also able to obtain the convergence rate of order @xmath29 for local strong solution of the continuum pde .    for the study of the pde , we discover four variational structures with four corresponding energy functionals , in terms of step height @xmath35 , step location @xmath43 , step density @xmath44 and anti - derivative of @xmath35 , denoted as @xmath45 .",
    "those four kinds of descriptions are equivalent rigorously for strong local solution but it is convenient to use different one when studying different aspects of our problem .",
    "the height @xmath35 is the original variable indicating the evolution of surface height while it is a better idea to use @xmath44 and @xmath45 to study the strong local solution of continuum model due to its concise variational structure . in the proof of convergence rate in section",
    "[ sec5 ] , [ consis ] and [ sec7 ] , since the original discrete model is described by each step location @xmath46 , it is more natural to use the variational structure of step location @xmath43 , which is the inverse function of step height @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath47    for the properties of local strong solution of continuum pde , we used the variational structures for @xmath45 and @xmath44 to establish some _ a - priori _ estimates and then obtain the existence and uniqueness for local strong solution to the continuum pde ; see section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we state the main result of section [ sec4 ] below , with the notations @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath49 and @xmath50 standard notations for sobolev spaces are assumed above .",
    "[ local_h ] assume @xmath51 @xmath52 , for some constant @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",

    "this is important in the construction of approximate solutions to the pde with high - order consistency , which is crucial in the proof of convergence .    for the convergence result of mesoscopic model ,",
    "we first testify our modified ode system has a global - in - time solution ; see proposition [ prop625 ] .",
    "more explicitly , we prove that the steps and terraces will keep monotone if we have monotone initial data .",
    "this is consistent with the positivity of step density @xmath44 of the pde .",
    "then we calculate the consistency of the step location continuum equation and ode system till order @xmath29 ; see theorem [ th4.4 ] . however , due to the nonlinearity and fourth order derivative in our problem , we need to utilize _ a - priori _ assumption method and construct an auxiliary solution with high - order consistency . by establishing the stability of the linearized ode system and carefully calculating the hessian of coefficient matrix of ode system , which is a 3rd - order tensor , we finally get the convergence rate @xmath61 of modified ode system to its continuum pde limit .    recall the definition and .",
    "denote @xmath62 and @xmath63 we state the main convergence result in this work as follows :    [ thm_main ] let the step height be @xmath64 .",
    "assume for some constant @xmath53 , some @xmath65 large enough , the initial datum @xmath66 satisfies @xmath67 let @xmath68 be the exact solution of on @xmath69,$ ] where @xmath70 is the maximal existence time for strong solution defined in theorem [ local_h ] .",
    "let @xmath71 be the inverse function of @xmath68 defined in , whose nodal values are denoted as @xmath72 let @xmath73 be the solution to ode with @xmath14 defined in and initial data @xmath74 .",

    "several remarks of the main result are in order .",
    "in fact , we can achieve a better convergence rate @xmath82 , if @xmath14 is modified to be @xmath83 compared with , the coefficient of the second term is changed from @xmath7 to @xmath84 .",
    "this is done to better correct the error from the discretization of the hilbert transform as @xmath85 ( recall the second term in is introduced to correct the singularity from the first term ) .",
    "in fact , by lemma [ l4.1 ] , we know the leading error @xmath86 in lemma [ l4.2 ] can be removed by such a correction term .",
    "hence we can get @xmath82 consistency in section [ consis ] , and consequently , the convergence rate can be improved to @xmath82 in theorem [ thm_main ] for the modified microscopic model .",
    "theorem  [ thm_main ] is a result of local convergence to strong solutions to the pde .",
    "the global convergence of the ode system to the ( weak ) global - in - time solution to the pde is more challenging and will be left for the future .",
    "we hope the additional understanding of the variational structures of the pde provided in this work would help the future investigation on global convergence .    to avoid unnecessary technical complications and to make the presentation of the convergence result clear , in this work we do not try to optimize the initial regularity that is needed in the theorem  [ thm_main ] .",
    "we just set @xmath87 to be large enough , so that we may assume sufficient regularity of the solution .",
    "while a comprehensive review of the vast literature of crystal growth is beyond the scope of this work , let us review here some related works mostly in the mathematical literature . besides the work of @xcite , the derivation of the continuum limit of bcf models have also been considered in other works ,",
    "see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , as far as we know , the derivation has not been done on the rigorous level and moreover , the convergence rate is provided here , which seems to be missing before in the literature .",
    "the idea using step location for formal asymptotic analysis was inspired by @xcite . in order to get the convergence rate rigorously , we find it is better to first study the continuum pde for the inverse function @xmath43 , instead of the height @xmath35 .",
    "recently , in the attachment - detachment - limited ( adl ) regime , al hajj shehadeh , kohn and weare @xcite studied the continuum limit of self - similar solution and obtained the convergence rate .",
    "related to the stability analysis , the linear stability of thin film ( known as the atg instability ) has been analyzed in previous works , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "while we consider here the one spatial dimensional models , the asymptotic derivation of two dimensional continuum models have been considered in margetis and kohn @xcite and xu and xiang @xcite , the rigorous aspects of these results will be interesting future research directions .",
    "for the discrete bcf model considered in @xcite , very recently , luo , xiang and yip @xcite rigorously proved the step bunch phenomenon , which characterized the limiting behavior of the system as @xmath88 .",
    "they have also connected the step bunching with continuum models through a @xmath89-convergence argument @xcite .",
    "these works motivate further study of the continuum limit of mesoscopic models of crystal growth .",
    "let us also mention that while our starting point is step flow models , the derivation of the continuum limit can be also considered starting from a more atomistic description , such as a kinetic monte carlo type model .",
    "see the works @xcite and more recently @xcite .",
    "see also a recent work that aims to derive bcf type models from a kinetic monte carlo lattice model @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , after setting up some notations , we introduce four equivalent forms of continuum pde and their variational structures .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to establish the existence , uniqueness and stability for local strong solution of the pde .",
    "we then introduce the modified step - flow ode in section [ sec5 ] , and state the global existence result for the modified ode system .",
    "section [ consis ] is devoted to prove the consistency result for ode system and its continuum limit pde .",
    "finally , by constructing an auxiliary solution with high - order consistency , we obtain the convergence rate of the modified ode to its continuum pde limit in section [ sec7 ] , which completes the proof of our main result theorem [ thm_main ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss the properties of the continuum model . besides using the height profile @xmath35",
    ", it would be useful to rewrite the dynamics in a few equivalent ways .",

    "first we observe that the evolution equation has a variational structure .",
    "define the total energy @xmath100 as a functional of @xmath35 : @xmath101 then we have @xmath102 where the chemical potential @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 to see this , let us calculate in lemma  [ l3.0 ] the functional derivative @xmath105 for @xmath106 the derivative of the other two terms in @xmath107 is straightforward .",
