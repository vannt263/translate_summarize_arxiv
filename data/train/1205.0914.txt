    "the complete list of regular excluded minors for signed - graphic matroids is provided in  @xcite , specifically :    a regular matroid @xmath0 is signed - graphic if and only if @xmath0 has no minor isomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "the matroids @xmath2 are the cographic matroids of the 29 non - separable forbidden minors for projective planar graphs , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two special matroids whose binary compact representation matrices are given in  @xcite and in the next section of this technical report .",
    "clearly one could easily produce the complete list of binary excluded minors for signed - graphic matroids by adding to the list of the above 31 regular excluded minors the binary excluded minors for regular matroids ( i.e. @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , since any binary signed - graphic matroid is also regular .",
    "[ th_rew ] a binary matroid @xmath0 is signed - graphic if and only if @xmath0 has no minor isomorphic to @xmath7 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "we define a cocircuit @xmath8 of a matroid @xmath0 to be _ graphic _ if the matroid @xmath9 is graphic .",
    "the main result in this report is the complete list of excluded minors for the class of binary signed - graphic matroids with graphic cocircuits . of importance for the proof of that result , theorem  [ th_ll3 ] here ,",
    "is the following lemma .",
    "[ lem_1 ] if @xmath10 is a minor of the matroid @xmath0 then for any cocircuit @xmath11 there exists a cocircuit @xmath12 such that @xmath13 is a minor of @xmath14 .    if @xmath15 then by duality @xmath16 . therefore by the definitions of contraction and deletion of a set",
    ", we have that for any cocircuit @xmath11 there exists a cocircuit @xmath12 such that    * @xmath17 , * @xmath18 ,    which in turn imply that @xmath19 .",
    "so we have @xmath20    [ th_ll3 ] let @xmath0 be a binary matroid such that all its cocircuits are graphic .",
    "then , @xmath0 is signed - graphic if and only if @xmath0 has no minor isomorphic to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath0 must contain a minor isomorphic to some matroid in the set @xmath23 by case analysis , verified also by the macek software  @xcite , it can be shown that for each matroid @xmath24 there exists a cocircuit @xmath25 such that the matroid @xmath26 contains an @xmath27 or an @xmath28 as a minor , which implies that @xmath29 is not graphic .",
    "therefore , by lemma  [ lem_1 ] , there is a cocircuit @xmath30 such that @xmath29 is a minor of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , @xmath31 is not graphic which is in contradiction with our assumption that @xmath0 has graphic cocircuits .",
    "as already mentioned , this technical report is mainly devoted to the computations performed using the macek software  @xcite appearing in the proof of theorem  [ th_ll3 ] .",
    "these computations are provided in detail in the next section .",
    "each case , i.e. matroid in @xmath32 in the proof of theorem  [ th_ll3 ] , will be examined separately and specifically :    * for each cographic matroids in @xmath32 , a compact representation matrix of its dual graphic matroid along with the associated graph ( @xmath33 ) are provided .",
    "it is clear that due to matroid duality , it is enough to find a circuit @xmath34 in each @xmath35 such that @xmath36 contains an @xmath37- or an @xmath38-minor .",
    "the advantage of working with the duals of the cographic matroids in @xmath32 is that someone could graphically see that by contracting a cycle ( i.e. the one corresponding to @xmath34 ) in the associated graph , a minor isomorphic to @xmath39 or @xmath40 is contained in the resulting graph .",
    "therefore , in that case , the macek computations may be seen just as a validation tool . * for each of the two non - cographic matroid in @xmath32 ( i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , a compact representation matrix is provided along with the cocircuit to be deleted .",
    "the macek commandss and the outputs showing that each of the resulting matroids contains an @xmath27 or an @xmath28 as a minor are given .",
