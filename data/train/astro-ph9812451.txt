    "since the discovery of kilohertz ( 4001200 hz ) quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) from 4u  172834 ( strohmayer et al 1996 ) and sco x-1 ( van der klis et al 1996 ) with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , there has been a concerted effort to characterize the phenomenon by examining a variety of low mass x - ray binary systems .",
    "to date nearly twenty such sources have been discovered ( van der klis 1998 ; strohmayer , swank , & zhang 1998 ) , and a general pattern has emerged . in nearly all of the sources two kilohertz",
    "qpo peaks are seen . both qpo frequencies increase and decrease as the source intensity and spectrum changes , but the separation between the two remains very nearly constant , suggesting a beat interpretation ( strohmayer et al 1996 ; miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) ,",
    "although this is not always so in observation or theory ( van der klis et al 1996 ; titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 ) .",
    "a third , nearly coherent oscillation is also seen sometimes during type i thermonuclear bursts , near frequencies either one or two times the separation frequency between the two kilohertz peaks , and suggests that the neutron star spin frequency is observed directly .    in this letter",
    "we present our findings from _ rxte _",
    "observations of the atoll source 4u  1702@xmath0429  ( oosterbroek et al 1991 ) , on 1997 july 1930 when it exhibited both two kilohertz qpo peaks and bursts with oscillations .",
    "preliminary results from a part of the data have already been presented by strohmayer , swank & zhang ( 1998 ) .",
    "strong kilohertz oscillations from 625925  hz were easily detected in several portions of the persistent emission of the source .",
    "a second , much broader kilohertz peak was also detected at higher frequencies using a sensitivity - enhancing averaging technique advanced by mndez et al ( 1998a ) .",
    "we also detected qpo and noise features in the 1100  hz frequency range , which changed during the observation .",
    "six type i bursts were seen , of which five exhibited sharp qpos near 330  hz .",
    "pointed observations of 4u  1702@xmath0429  by _ rxte _  proportional counter array ( pca ) occurred between 1997  july 19 , 21 , 26 , and 30 , for a total exposure of approximately 101  ks .",
    "in addition to the `` standard '' modes , data were also collected in an `` event '' mode with 125 microsecond timing and spectral information for individual x - ray events .",
    "burst `` trigger '' and `` catcher '' modes were also used .",
    "the average source intensity changed significantly over the course of the observation ; average background subtracted rates ( 2.5 - 16 kev ) were 670 s@xmath4 july 19 and july 21 , 990 s@xmath4 july 26 , and 859 s@xmath4 july 30 .",
    "we used the background models based on the `` very large event '' ( vle ) rate and the activation rate during non - source sky observations ( model version 1 ) .",
    "the color - color diagram is shown in figure  [ fcolor ] .",
    "the color differences reflect spectral differences which are significant , although not large . for the persistent flux ,",
    "the standard  2 spectral data were gathered for intervals with similar temporal behavior , using only data up to 30  kev in the top layer of detector anodes of all proportional counters .",
    "a systematic error of 1.5% was added ( this error was needed to fit contemporaneous crab data ) .",
    "acceptable fits were obtained with a cut off power law spectrum @xmath5 . for july 26 ( 10.313.8 ut ) the photon index @xmath6 and @xmath7  kev , while for july 30 ( 8.512.0 ut ) @xmath8=0.80 @xmath9 0.03 , and @xmath10 .",
    "plausibly , the steeper power law and higher @xmath11 correspond to upper left points in figure  [ fcolor ] , the flatter power law and lower @xmath11 to the rightmost points in the figure .",
    "the flux ranged from 1.7(1.3)@xmath12 erg @xmath13 s@xmath4 on july 19 and 21 to 2.6(2.0)@xmath12 erg @xmath13 s@xmath4 on july 26 , for 1.630 ( 210 ) kev .",
    "these values overlap those reported for previous observations ( christian & swank 1997 ; oosterbroek et al 1991 ) .",
    "event data for channels 079 ( 0.0329.1  kev ) were used to construct power spectra in 8  s segments , which were then averaged in groups of 16 ( i.e. , averaged over 128  s ) to increase signal to noise .",
    "power spectra on july  19 have a faint but significant qpo feature near 890910  hz with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 32  hz and rms amplitude of 6.2% .",
    "the frequency changes significantly during the observation . a narrow but lower frequency qpo appears in the july  30 observations , during which the frequency of the qpo wanders continuously between 625825  hz , with a mean frequency of 722  hz . the presence and absence of these high frequency qpos is indicated in figure  [ fcolor ] .",
    "a heavily rebinned spectrum of july  30 indicated a much fainter and broader peak at about 1000  hz was present , which tracked the lower peak . to more precisely determine the parameters of the upper and lower peak , the `` shift and average '' technique",
    "was employed to align the lower peak .",
    "this technique was first applied to find a weaker upper qpo peak in 4u  160852 ( mndez et al 1998a ) , and is optimal when the peak separation remains constant or nearly so .",
    "the centroid of the lower strong and narrow peak was fitted in each 128  s spectrum individually .",
    "the spectra were then shifted so that the centroid frequency became the mean fitted frequency ( 722  hz ) .",
    "finally the spectra were averaged , producing a strong single peak at 722  hz .",
    "( figure  [ fshiftadd ] ) .",
    "the same technique was applied to data from july  19 , except that all peaks were aligned to the average frequency of 902  hz .",
    "the power spectrum of july  30 clearly shows a second broader peak at approximately 1050  hz ( the average centroid frequency of the upper peak ) .",
    "we fitted the average july  30 spectrum with a model composed of a constant ( representing poisson noise level ) and two lorentzian peaks , where the upper peak centroid frequency was parameterized in terms of an offset @xmath14 from the lower peak .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the model are in table  [ tqpo ] , and show the upper peak was detected at a very high significance on july  30 at a separation of @xmath2  hz from the lower peak . on july  19 when the narrow qpo was present at @xmath15  hz there was no evidence for a second peak ; the 95% confidence limits for the rms amplitude of qpos having a fwhm 10 and 100  hz are 1.7% and 2.9% , respectively .",
    "no qpo peaks were present on july  21 or july  26 individually .",
    "combined , the 95% confidence upper limits for both days are 1.2% and 2.0% for qpos with fwhms of 10 and 100  hz , respectively .",
    "both qpos are similar to those observed from other kilohertz qpo sources . in cases where the high frequency qpos were detected ,",
    "the fractional rms amplitude increases with energy . on july  30 , the rms fraction of the lower peak increased monotonically from 5.5% to 10.7% to 13.1% in the channel ranges 0 to 17 ( 0.036.2  kev ) , 18 to 26 ( 6.59.4  kev ) and 27 to 79 ( 9.829.1  kev ) ; the amplitude was about 30% less on july  19 .",
    "the amplitude of the upper peak on july  30 , the only day it was detected , increased from 3.5% to 6.1% to 12.5% in the same energy bands . in both sco x-1 and 4u  160852",
    ", the separation between upper and lower qpo frequencies is not a constant , but rather decreases with either count rate or the lower qpo frequency ( van der klis et al 1997 ; mndez et al 1998b ) . on july  30 , when the upper peak is detected , the centroid frequency of the lower peak varies from 625825  hz .",
    "we attempted to determine whether the frequency separation also varies by grouping the individual 128  s power spectra in ranges according to the lower qpo centroid frequency before shifting : @xmath16675  hz , 675725  hz , and @xmath17725  hz . above 725  hz the upper peak becomes weaker , and degraded statistics prevent further divisions .",
    "the groups were shifted and averaged , and fitted by the same model as in table  [ tqpo ] .",
    "the inset of figure  [ fshiftadd ] shows the fitted frequency separation as a function of the lower qpo frequency .",
    "the three spectra were also fitted to a model where the separation was held fixed .",
    "an @xmath18-test indicates that the hypothesis of constant separation can be rejected at only a 1.5@xmath19 confidence level .",
    "nevertheless , the general trend in figure  [ fshiftadd ] is similar to that seen in both 4u  160852 and sco x-1 .",
    "4u  1702@xmath0429  also exhibits transient variability at frequencies below 100  hz ; at several points during the observation both qpo and broad band noise features were observed .",
    "figure  [ fbroadband ] shows a representative sample of average unshifted 64  s power spectra . between july  26.626.9 , when no kilohertz qpos were present , the source had a very strong 80  hz qpo and a lower frequency band limited complex of variability between 560  hz .",
    "we fitted the power spectrum with a model consisting of a constant , a power law , and up to three lorentzian functions .",
    "the best fit qpo parameters for the observations are given in table  [ tqpo ] , and the representative models are plotted in figure  [ fbroadband ] .",
    "when the two kilohertz qpos returned on july  30 , only a single 35  hz qpo peak was seen ( figure  [ fbroadband ] , upper curve ) . on both days ,",
    "the continuum extended to about 1  mhz , where a turnover was evident .",
    "the noise continuum changed over the observation , with power law indices of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 on july  19 , 21 , 26 , 30 , respectively .",
    "the integrated low frequency noise ( @xmath24  hz ) was 1.8 , 3.4 , 4.0 and 1.7% for the same days .",
    "although there does not appear to be a direct harmonic relationship between any of the qpo frequencies below 100  hz , the centroid of the 35  hz peak on july  30 is correlated with the centroid of the simultaneously - present kilohertz qpos .",
    "we found that as the mean kilohertz qpo frequency increased in each band from 657  hz to 702  hz to 769  hz , the low frequency qpo centroid increased from @xmath25  hz to @xmath26  hz to @xmath27  hz , thus establishing a ratio of @xmath28 between the two .",
    "this linkage between the kilohertz and lower frequency qpos is similar to that seen previously ( e.g. sco x-1 , van der klis et al 1996 ; 4u  1728@xmath034 , ford & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "a total of six type i ( thermonuclear ) x - ray bursts occurred during the observations .",
    "the peak pca count rate ( 290 kev ) during the bursts ranged from a low of 14,000  ct  s@xmath4  to a maximum of 26,000  ct  s@xmath4 . to search for pulsations we used the 290  kev burst mode high time resolution data to compute power spectra from consecutive 2  s intervals beginning near the peak of each burst .",
    "we detected pulsations at @xmath29  hz in five of the six bursts .",
    "pulsation amplitudes in the 224  kev band ranged from a few percent to as high as 18% ( rms ) .",
    "the pulsation frequency increases during all the bursts , eventually reaching an upper , limiting frequency in the decaying tail of the burst .",
    "this behavior is nearly identical to the frequency evolution of pulsations observed in bursts from 4u  172834 and other sources with oscillations during bursts ( see strohmayer et al .",
    "1998 ; and strohmayer , swank & zhang 1998 ) . to illustrate this behavior we computed dynamic power spectra for each burst using 2  s intervals with a new interval beginning every 0.125  s. figure",
    "[ fburst ] shows such a dynamic power spectrum computed for the burst observed on 1997  july 26 at 14:04:19  ut , with the pca countrate overlaid .",
    "the run of frequency during this burst of relatively low peak luminosity was similar to that of the high luminosity burst shown in strohmayer , swank , & zhang ( 1998 ) .",
    "we will present a more comprehensive timing and spectral analysis of the bursts in a subsequent publication .",
    "atoll burst sources range in estimated luminosity from a hundredth to perhaps a third of the eddington limit for neutron stars .",
    "kilohertz - range qpos have been seen in sources throughout this luminosity range .",
    "4u  1702@xmath0429  is an atoll burst source with a luminosity , assuming a distance of 7  kpc ( oosterbroek et al 1991 ) , of about @xmath30  erg  s@xmath4 which is similar to that of 4u  1728@xmath034 and 4u  1705@xmath044 .",
    "we found that 4u  1702@xmath0429 , like 4u  1728@xmath034 ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ) also exhibits two kilohertz qpos with a separation of about 330  hz , to be compared to 363  hz for 4u  1728@xmath034 .",
    "furthermore , five bursts exhibited flux oscillations within a few hertz of 330  hz .",
    "this makes 4u  1702@xmath0429  only the second source in which the dominant burst power is at the frequency of the difference between the two higher frequencies seen in the persistent flux .",
    "the lower qpo peak has been interpreted as a beat between the upper peak and the neutron star spin frequency ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "the separation between the two kilohertz peaks is approximately constant for several sources , and is thought to be the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "our results here are consistent with a constant separation , although a small variation is suggested .    on july  30 , when both peaks are observed , the highest frequency of the upper qpo is inferred to be at least 1156  hz , assuming the peak separation is 333  hz .",
    "given that the lower peak on july  30 is quite narrow compared to the upper one , it seems likely that the single peak that appears on july  19 is also a `` lower '' peak based on its width .",
    "if that is so , then we might speculate that the maximum upper frequency , although not detected , is as high as @xmath31  hz . in either case , the range of 11001200  hz is consistent with the maximum frequency observed in other kilohertz qpo sources .",
    "the small changes in burst frequency during the burst are similar to those of 4u  1728@xmath034 ( strohmayer et al . 1996 ) and the oscillations appear equally as consistent with rotation of a single spot on the neutron star .",
    "_  all - sky monitor record of 4u  1702@xmath0429  shows that the source intensity range is about 25100  mcrab . during the week spanning the observations , the range was about 7090  mcrab ,",
    "yet the source exhibited markedly varied behavior .",
    "the atoll sources were defined by hasinger and van der klis ( 1989 ) in terms of both crude spectral behavior ( color - color diagrams ) and the continuum shape of the power spectra , based on _ exosat _ data .",
    "the hard and soft colors trace a curve reminiscent of an atoll , comprised of an `` island '' and a crescent shaped `` banana '' branch . in the power spectra low frequency noise",
    "is prevalent on the banana branches , and flat high frequency noise identifies the island state . in _ rxte _",
    "data a pattern has emerged in which the kilohertz qpo appear to be present in the lower banana and at least part of the island state ( e.g. , 4u  1608@xmath052 , mndez et al 1998a ; aql x-1 , cui et al 1998 ; 4u  1735@xmath044 , wijnands et al 1998 ; 4u  1820@xmath030 , zhang et al .",
    "even with the limited excursions of our observations , the color - color diagram suggests that 4u  1702@xmath0429  behaves similarly .",
    "if we follow the behavior of the other sources , then we would predict that the kilohertz qpos would fade out during the flares and possibly at minimum flux .",
    "these observations may not have quite reached the island state , which is described as having band limited white noise with a cut - off near the low - frequency qpo .",
    "the continuum portion of the power spectrum of july  30 , while shallower than july  26 , was not flat .",
    "on the other hand , the power spectrum of july  26 which has a steep low frequency component , and is thus presumably in an intermediate banana state , also has unaccounted - for qpo - like structures .",
    "we should note that the color - color diagram suggests the banana branch may not be unique .    a strong 35",
    "hz feature accompanies the kilohertz qpos , and while the lower kilohertz qpo does not have large excursions , the two do appear to track each other .",
    "this behavior might be expected if the 35  hz qpo represented lense - thirring precession of a warped inner accretion disk under the influence of a spinning compact body ( stella & vietri 1998 ) .",
    "the theory predicts oscillations in the tens of hertz range , depending on the ratio of the moment of inertia ( @xmath32  g  @xmath33 ) to the mass of the neutron star @xmath34 . assuming the neutron star spin frequency is 330  hz",
    ", the kepler frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disk is 330  hz higher than the lower peak , and the ratio @xmath35 is a free parameter , we fit to the functional form of stella & vietri ( 1998 ) , and find a ratio of @xmath36 .",
    "although this value is too high for most neutron star equations of state , which approach unity ( markovi & lamb 1998 ) , it is closer than the reported ratios of 45 for most other qpo sources with such measurements ( e.g. , 4u  1735@xmath044 , wijnands et al 1998 ; 4u  1728@xmath034 , ford & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "the catalog of low frequency qpos is indeed complex .",
    "a 3540  hz qpo accompanies the kilohertz qpos but with varying width .",
    "the power spectrum of july  26 also shows a @xmath130  hz qpo , as well as @xmath110  hz and 80  hz components , while on july  21 a peak at @xmath130  hz is not present .",
    "such qpos have been detected in other atoll sources and may be comparable to the horizontal branch oscillations ( hbo ) of z sources .",
    "however , the 80  hz frequency observed here is one of the highest so far seen below 100  hz in a neutron star system .",
    "the power spectrum of gx 13 + 1 , an atoll source several times brighter than 4u  1702@xmath0429 , has interesting similarities to the power spectra we have seen for 4u  1702@xmath0429  when the kilohertz qpo were not seen .",
    "homan et al .",
    "1998 found a 5761  hz qpo when the source was in an upper part of a banana branch in the color - color diagram , along with very low frequency noise described by a power law of index @xmath37 , and a peaked noise component .",
    "the power spectrum of 4u  1702@xmath0429  in the highest part of its banana branch contains similar components .",
    "homan et al suggest the peaked noise and the qpo in gx  13 + 1 correspond to the low frequency noise ( lfn ) and hbo in z sources and to the high frequency noise and low frequency qpo in atoll sources .",
    "it is interesting that 4u  1702@xmath0429  exhibits the atoll low frequency qpo ( although not the noise ) when the kilohertz qpo is present , and is similar to gx  13 + 1 when it is not present .",
