    "unitarity requires that final state strong interactions should be taken into account in kaon decay amplitudes . on the other hand ,",

    ", they could represent a meaningful test of the theoretical approach based on effective chiral lagrangians and the related amplitude expansions in powers of meson momenta ( chiral perturbation theory ) , which should incorporate general features of long - distance qcd @xcite .",
    "the role of @xmath2 phase shifts in @xmath3 decays has been extensively discussed @xcite .",
    "these transitions involve the @xmath2 phase shifts at @xmath4 , and at this energy scale the correction to the leading order prediction in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) are found to be large in each isospin channel @xcite .    in @xmath0 ,",
    "final state strong interactions act at substantially lower energy compared to @xmath3 , and consequently in current fits to experimental data they have been assumed to be negligible @xcite . as a matter of fact , these effects could be experimentally accessible in the near future .    in the approximation of considering only two - body strong interactions , thus neglecting the irreducible @xmath5 rescattering diagrams which should be suppressed by phase space , in principle @xmath0 final state interactions can provide a complementary way to study @xmath2 phase shifts near threshold . indeed , this is the region where these phase shifts can be most reliably predicted in the framework of chpt .",
    "therefore , such an analysis should allow an independent , and significant test of this theoretical approach , to be combined with , e.g. , those from @xmath6 decays @xcite , also relevant to the @xmath2 low - energy region .    as another important point of interest , we recall that the knowledge of rescattering is crucial in order to estimate direct cp - violating asymmetries in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "manifestations of such asymmetries would allow to determine the existence of direct cp - violation in a channel alternative to @xmath3 , and to improve our knowledge of this phenomenon , which is predicted by the standard model but not clearly established yet .    as emphasized in @xcite ,",
    "a convenient way to study final state interactions in @xmath0 is to consider @xmath7 interference in vacuum as a function of time at `` interferometry '' machines such as lear @xcite and the @xmath8-factory da@xmath9ne @xcite .",

    "@xcite .    actually , in the case of @xmath0 it is not quite appropriate to use the notion of constant phase shifts , because : _",

    "phenomenologically , @xmath0 transition amplitudes for the various modes are expanded in powers of the kinematical variables with constant coefficients , so that the momentum dependence of rescattering should be taken into account for a consistent expansion .",
