    "pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars fall to the upper right of the main sequence on the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , journeying towards the main sequence via radial contraction . for the first several million years , a pms star is surrounded by a disk of gas and dust , left over from the early stage of star formation .",
    "the evolution of a disk is not well understood .",
    "circumstellar disks provide the raw material for planet formation .",
    "thus , understanding the evolution of a disk helps us understand planet formation .",
    "clues to the physical conditions of planet formation and hence future suitability for life on planets other than earth potentially can be inferred from a detailed characterization of inner young stellar object ( yso ) disks .",
    "herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars are intermediate - mass pms stars with spectral types earlier than g0 , located close to the zero - age main - sequence .",
    "early spectral energy distribution ( sed ) modeling efforts @xcite to explain the infrared excess of haebe stars assumed ( a ) optically thick but geometrically thin circumstellar disks with inner optically thin holes , up to several stellar radii , in order to account for the observed inflections in the 1 - 5@xmath0 m region , and ( b ) relatively large accretion rates , on the order of 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , in order to account for the strength of the 3.8@xmath0 m ( l - band ) excess .",
    "it was quickly pointed out @xcite that at such a large mass accretion rate , the gas in the inner dust - free hole is expected to be optically - thick and to produce excess near - infrared emission , which is inconsistent with the dip seen in the near - infrared sed . for the relatively low accretion rates later inferred for haebe objects",
    ", disk models could not explain the observed seds in the near- infrared region .",
    "puffed - up inner dust - rim models were introduced @xcite and later refined to ameliorate the shortcomings of the classical disk models .",
    "these later models attribute the near - infrared excess to stellar radiation shining directly on the inner dust edge of the dust disk .",
    "tuthill et al . ( 2001 ) directly imaged the high luminosity yso lkh@xmath5  101 and independently proposed that the bulk of the near - infrared emission arises in a hot ring located at the dust sublimation radius .",
    "long - baseline interferometric observations provide the milliarcsecond angular resolution required to resolve the planet - forming structures immediately surrounding pms stars .",
    "such high - angular - resolution infrared observations are well suited for probing near - circumstellar environments since the inner zones of the circumstellar disks and envelopes emit primarily at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "a large number of ysos across the luminosity range have now been spatially resolved at near - infrared wavelengths , showing that indeed the characteristic sizes correlate strongly with central luminosity , lending support to the `` puffed - up '' inner dust rim paradigm , especially for herbig ae objects .",
    "however , it was also pointed out @xcite that most higher luminosity herbig be objects are considerably undersized compared to the predictions of this model , and in better agreement with the `` classical '' models featuring optically thick emission that extends inward very close to the central star .",
    "mwc  419 is a photometrically variable emission line star that is in many ways typical of the haebe class , including illumination of a reflection nebula @xcite .",
    "mwc  419 has spectral type b8 @xcite , luminosity 330 l@xmath6 @xcite , and distance 650 pc @xcite ; it is also known as v594 cas or bd+61 154 .",
    "narrow band h@xmath5 imaging studies show unipolar large scale structures around mwc  419 .",
    "interestingly , these images show two lobes on the south - east side of mwc  419 - the outer lobe extending to @xmath7 4 arcminutes - suggesting a history of episodic mass - loss in this pms star s evolution .",
    "these authors attribute the non - detection of north - west lobes to obscuration .",
    "these large scale structures have no influence on our observations of the central region .",
    "the measured intrinsic polarization of mwc  419 in the v - band is 0.53% @xcite suggesting that the contributions from reflected optical light to the total emission is insignificant .",
    "no close companions to mwc  419 are known .",
    "the star has p - cygni characteristics in the lower balmer lines and the implied wind has been modeled in detail by bouret & catala ( 1998 ) . however , it has also been considered as a b[e ] star and interpreted as undergoing post - main sequence evolution rather than pre - main sequence evolution .",
    "the star is projected on the outer regions of the young association ngc 225 @xcite , within a small area of enhanced extinction and co emission that is associated with the dark cloud l  1302 .",
    "however , the membership of the star in the cluster is debated ( lattanzi et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the age of the cluster is often quoted as 120 myr @xcite but subramaniam et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have argued based on the presence of a number of young stars that it is really a @xmath810 myr pre - main sequence population . as an iras and iso source",
    ", the infrared dust spectrum and spectral energy distribution of mwc  419 have been discussed by several authors .",
    "no spitzer data were obtained for this source but it has a weak silicate emission at 10 @xmath0 m in ground - based data .",
    "mwc  419 was previously observed interferometrically using the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) , and was spatially resolved in the k - band with a reported uniform - disk angular diameter of 3.34 @xmath90.16 milliarcsec ( mas ) , or a gaussian distribution fwhm of 2.07@xmath90.11 mas .",
    "mwc  419 was not resolved from the infrared optical telescope array ( iota ) interferometer observations @xcite , where the angular resolution was @xmath7 6 mas at 2.2@xmath0 m .",
    "the keck interferometer ( ki ) , with @xmath73 mas angular resolution at 2.2@xmath0 m , can resolve the inner disks ( @xmath7 1 au ) of nearby pms stars .",
    "in this paper we report observations of mwc  419 using multi - color interferometry at well - separated wavelengths , here k - band ( 2.0 - 2.4 @xmath0 m ) and l - band ( 3.5 - 4.1 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the simultaneous k- and l - band interferometric measurements enable us to probe different regions ( @xmath7 1300k and 800k respectively ) of the inner circumstellar disks of pms stars .",
    "discrete spatial distributions , such as dust - rims , and relatively - smooth spatial distributions , such as classical accretion disks , are expected to have different size vs. wavelength behaviors and can be distinguished in such multi - color observations at well separated wavelengths .",
    "in addition , interferometric measurements in the relatively unexplored l - band provide further constraints to the disk / envelope geometry via temperature- and density - sensitivity of different models .",
    "multicolor interferometry at well separated wavelengths ( h , k and n - bands ) was recently reported for two other yso disks , namely , mwc  297 and mwc  147 @xcite from vlti observations . in section 2 ,",
    "below , we present our observations and data reduction . in section 3",
    "we describe the data analysis where we fit the visibility - squared ( @xmath10 ) data with various yso disk models . in section 4",
    "we discuss our results and in section 5 we provide a brief summary .",
    "ki is a near- and mid - infrared long - baseline interferometer consisting of two 10-m diameter apertures separated by a @xmath11 = 85-m baseline at a position angle of @xmath7 38@xmath12 east of north .",
    "both keck telescopes are equipped with adaptive optics .",
    "the maximum resolution of our ki observations is @xmath13/2@xmath11 @xmath72.7 mas and @xmath74.5 mas in the k - band and l - band respectively .",
    "the l - band science instrument , consisting of an infrared camera and beam - combiner optics , is similar to the existing h- and k - band instrument ( fatcat ) routinely used for @xmath10 measurements since 2002 @xcite .",
    "we obtained first light with this new instrument in april 2008 .",
    "the l - band limiting magnitude of 6 is set by the requirement for a broadband phase signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 10 in the 10 ms fringe - tracker frame .",
    "the total integration time on source is typically 200 sec , which provides good snr for @xmath10 measurements in the 10 spectral channels .",
    "the l - band instrument uses a picnic focal plane array detector with a 5 @xmath0 m cutoff wavelength , while fatcat uses a hawaii array .",
    "the detector electronics are similar for both instruments .",
    "details of this l - band instrument are given in ragland et al .",
    "for the current work a prototype multi - wavelength observing capability was used , enabling simultaneous k- and l - band observations of our science target . in this configuration ,",
    "the telescope pupil is split into left and right - halves at the dual - star modules of both telescopes and routed through separate coude paths utilizing the existing beam - train infrastructure for the nulling mode .",
    "the left - half pupils of both telescopes are combined by the k - band instrument and the right - half pupils are combined by l - band instrument .",
    "the k- and l - band science instruments each have 2 complementary interferometric outputs with different spectrometers on each . for l - band , these are a ( pseudo ) broad - band , and a low dispersed mode ( 10 channels across the l - band ; r = 60 ) . for k band , these are a broad - band , and a medium dispersion mode ( 42 channels across the k - band ; r = 230 ) .    the field - of - view of the instrument , defined by the single mode fibers that couple that light to the detector array , is @xmath7 55 mas for the k - band and @xmath7 93 mas for the l - band observations .",
    "these field restrictions were enforced in our modeling work .",
    "the zabcd algorithm @xcite is used for fringe tracking and science measurements . in this procedure",
    "five reads are made while the fast delay line scans over one wavelength ( 2.2 @xmath0 m for the k - band and 3.7 @xmath0 m for the l - band ) ; explicitly , the reads are the reset pedestal ( z ) , followed by four non - destructive reads ( a , b , c , d ) spaced at @xmath13/4 intervals as the detector integrates up . for each quarter - wave bin",
    "we then calculate @xmath14 , @xmath15 , etc .",
    "these values are used to estimate the square of the fringe visibility ( @xmath10 ) for science , and the fringe phase and snr for fringe tracking .",
    "we apply corrections to the bin data to account for detector bias and for differences between the length of the delay scan and the actual wavelength .",
    "residual instrument bias and atmospheric seeing effects are corrected by observing a calibrator of known @xmath10 under similar observing conditions .",
    "essentially , we estimate instrument transfer function using the bracketing observations of calibrator stars with known angular diameters using a weighted averaging scheme that considers the time and sky proximity of calibrators relative to the target .",
    "the observations reported here were taken on the night of ut 19 august 2008 .",
    "we observed two calibrators - hd  1843 and hd  6210 - under similar observing conditions as the science target to calibrate the science data .",
    "the adopted angular sizes of the calibrators are 1.0@xmath90.02 and 0.5@xmath90.01 mas respectively @xcite .",
    "we performed bracketed calibration meaning that our observing sequence consisted of calibrator - target - calibrator measurements .",
    "the measurements presented here were taken over a narrow range of position angles ( 25@xmath12 to 33@xmath12 ) and projected baselines ( 76.1 m to 77.8 m ) , and hence no attempt was made to derive an inclination angle and position angle of the disk .",
    "for the purpose of this article , we assume that the disk is face - on .",
    "thus , the sizes reported here are the values along the position angle of about 29@xmath12 , and the actual size of the disk could be larger depending on the inclination angle and position angle .",
    "our k - band measurements , taken at the position angle of about 29@xmath12 , gives similar disk size as that of previous pti observations , taken at the position angle of about 83@xmath12 .",
    "hence , a face - on disk for mwc  419 is a resonable assumption in the absence of necessary high spatial resolution observations .",
    "in this section , we fit our measurements with different models of increasing complexity and increasing physical realism .",
    "the measured @xmath10 includes contributions from the central star ( v@xmath16 ) and the bright circumstellar disk .",
    "the visibility - square ( v@xmath17 ) of the circumstellar disk of mwc  419 is obtained from the measured data by removing the contributions from the central star @xcite using    @xmath18    the adopted disk - to - star flux ratio ( f@xmath19/f@xmath20 ) is 12 and 40 in k and l based on our sed analysis discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "the central star is assumed to be unresolved for our observations ( i.e. , v@xmath20 = 1.0 ) , which is a reasonable assumption for a b8 star at a distance of 650pc .",
    "these corrections yield values of @xmath21 that are smaller than the total @xmath10 by 0.04 ( @xmath7 9% ) and 0.01 ( @xmath7 2% ) in k and l respectively .",
    "the k - band @xmath10 measurements are consistent with earlier k broadband measurements and provide additional spectrally resolved information within the k - band spectral region .",
    "the visibilities of the disk models ( section 3.2 and 3.3 ) are computed by numerically summing the contributions from annular rings of infinitesimally small widths and weighting them by their respective flux contributions ; for this purpose , we divided the disk radially into 5000 annular rings , in logarithmic scale . the normalized visibility for a uniformly bright annular ring with an inner diameter of @xmath22 , an outer diameter of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the first - order bessel function , @xmath11 is the projected baseline and @xmath13 is the wavelength of observation .",
    "the flux from such an annular uniform ring can be written as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the planck blackbody function and @xmath29 is the mean temperature of the annular ring .",
    "now , the visibility of the total disk can be written as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the total disk flux derived by summing all the annular rings of the disk in order to normalize the flux .",
    "we adopted a nonlinear least - squares fitting method to minimize the chi - square for all our modeling work .    for our sed analysis ,",
    "photometric measurements from the literature are used , after interstellar extinction corrections using the extinction law of cardelli et al .",
    "the extinction for mwc  419 in the v - band is assumed to be @xmath32 = 2.1 @xcite .",
    "the models presented in this article assume face - on geometry for the disk . a disk with an inclination angle",
    "@xmath33 could predict a larger inner disk radius depending on the inclination angle and the position angle of the projected interferometer baseline on the sky . in this case",
    ", sed models would underestimate the flux at all wavelengths by a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , classical accretion disk models would have a factor of @xmath34 larger accretion rate to explain the sed data and power - law models would have a relatively larger disk temperature at all radial distances .",
    "the measurements presented in this article consist of spectrally dispersed data within the k- and l - bands . as stated above",
    ", the k and l visibilities corrected for the stellar contribution are different , suggesting a wavelength dependence to the size of the spatially resolved emission .",
    "we can use the spectrally dispersed data to investigate in more detail this wavelength dependency .",
    "we choose three geometrical models , namely , uniform - disk , gaussian distribution and ring models , to fit to our measurements .",

    "to start , we fit the data with a wavelength - independent geometrical model ( figure  [ basic ] ) .",

    "the corresponding reduced - chi - square ( @xmath39 ) values are 36.1 , 35.0 and 38.3 respectively .",
    "as indicated by the very poor @xmath39 values , the uniform disk , gaussian and ring models fit neither the k and l data in the mean , nor the slope of the visibilities throughout either the k- or l - bands .        as the wavelength - independent size models fail to fit the measurements , we fit the data with wavelength - dependent sizes .",

    "the steep slopes of these linear relations suggest that the 2 - 4@xmath0 m emission source must be extended with strong radial temperature dependence .",
    "earlier multi - color ( near- and mid - infrared ) interferometry of two yso disks have shown similar wavelength dependence . in the following section we explore more complex extended disk models to explain our observations .",
    "we compared our interferometric data with an accretion disk model by hillenbrand et al .",
    "( 1992 ) based on an sed analysis . in this classical accretion disk model , the temperature distribution of dust is derived by combining the contributions from a radiatively heated reprocessing component t@xmath42 and a viscously heated accretion component t@xmath43 .",

    "the physical reason that the classical accretion disk model fails is that it creates too much flux in the inner region of the disk because of the added accretion luminosity , making the angular size much smaller than observed .",

    "hence , a binary scenario is not favored as an explanation for our measurements .",
    "the ki measurements presented here agree with previous observations from pti of the k - band size of mwc 419 .",
    "the addition of the spectrally dispersed k - band information and new l - band observations , also spectrally dispersed , provide powerful new constraints on the physical structure of the material surrounding the central star . as shown the left - most panel of figure 2 ,",
    "the wavelength dependence of the size is apparent within both the k and l bands ; the combination of the two bands allows an even tighter constraint on the temperature power - law than possible using either data set alone .",
    "the radial temperature profiles of the disk models presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3 are shown in figure  [ temp_profile ] .",
    "the temperature profile of the best fit power - law model is very similar to that of a classical , geometrically thin accretion / reprocessing disk ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "as discussed earlier ( section 3.2 ) , the accretion disk model requires an unrealistically large accretion rate , on the order of a few times 10@xmath47 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 in order to fit the sed data .",

    "the necessity of an unrealistically large accretion rate in the accretion disk model is probably an artifact of the physically unrealistic assumption of a zero - thickness disk which causes the re - processing of radiation to be very inefficient .",
    "hence , we do not favor an accretion disk model for the mwc  419 disk .    a power law temperature profile with radius in which the radial exponent is a free parameter is a very good fit to the data , because such a simple model roughly accounts for the vertical scale height as a function of radius .",

    "flat \" disk geometry that one tends to find for herbig be stars .",
    "earlier studies @xcite using broadband , usually single - wavelength , interferometric data , recognized a difference in the near - infrared size vs. luminosity behavior of high luminosity objects ( pre - main sequence be ) compared to lower luminosity ones ( pre - main sequence ae ) , the former being more consistent with  classical disk \" models .",
    "this has been revisited most recently by vinkovi & jurki ( 2007 ) , who use a model - independent comparison of visibility to scaled baseline and find a distinction between low - luminosity ( @xmath60 10@xmath61 l@xmath62 ) and high - luminosity ( @xmath63 10@xmath61 l@xmath3 ) yso disks where the luminosity break point corresponds to approximate spectral type b3-b5 .",
    "these authors then modelled this observable with a ring and halo model for low luminosity herbigs , a halo alone for t tauris and an accretion disk for high luminosity herbigs .    however , multi - wavelength interferometric studies have not always supported these conclusions when objects are modeled in detail .",
    "kraus et al . ( 2008 ) observed the b6 star mwc 147 in h , k and n bands .",
    "they performed monte carlo modeling and found that the interferometric and sed date were not well fit with a standard , irradiated accretion disk alone , but were well fit with the standard disk plus emission from hot , optically thick gas within the innermost radius of the dust disk .",
    "in contrast , acke et al .",
    "( 2008 ) observed the b1.5 star mwc 297 in h , k and n , and found that they could not fit the data with a single accretion disk , even with the radial temperature exponent as a free parameter .",
    "instead , they used a three component geometric model , with characteristic blackbody temperatures of 1700 , 920 and 520 k. our results show that mwc  419 ( b8 , 330 l@xmath3 ) has the disk characteristics of a high - luminosity object in the categories of monnier & millan - gabet ( 2002 ) but a luminosity lower than the break point of 10@xmath61 l@xmath3 identified by vinkovi & jurki ( 2007 ) . examining figure 2 of vinkovi & jurki ( 2007 ) clearly shows mwc  419 fits well within the population of lower luminosity herbigs in their model - independent comparison .",
    "their physical interpretation of the low - luminosity herbig group is an optically thick disk with an optically thin dust sublimation cavity and an optically thin dusty outflow .",
    "our multi - wavelength results do not support grouping mwc 419 in that physical model , but perhaps incorporating multi - wavelength data in the model - independent visibility groupings would have produced a different result .",
    "the new multi - wavelength data set presented here provides significant new information to aid in determining the physical conditions of these young stars , and our data show that the disk surrounding the b8 star mwc 419 is closer in physical characteristics to the more massive be stars than to the herbig ae and t tauri stars .",
    "another result from the spectrally dispersed data is that the measured @xmath10 is marginally higher at 2.17@xmath0 m than at adjacent wavelengths .",
    "this @xmath10 feature is seen in all 4 independent data sets .",
    "as this is the wavelength of br @xmath1 , and brackett recombination emission lines such as br @xmath1 and br 10 - 20 are observed in the spectrum of mwc  419 @xcite , we attribute the difference in line and continuum visibilities to a more compact br @xmath1 emitting region .",
    "similar behavior in the apparent size in the br @xmath1 line compared to the neighboring continuum has been seen before in spectrally resolved interferometry from both vlti and ki @xcite .",
    "the derived uniform - disk diameter for the br @xmath1 emitting region is 3.33@xmath90.03 mas , which is @xmath7 4% less than the continuum size ( 3.46 mas ) around br @xmath1 ( figure  [ ud ] ) .",
    "the significance level of this detection of the br @xmath1 emitting region with respect to the continuum region is @xmath7 2 @xmath48 .",
    "the actual size of the br @xmath1 emission line region could be much smaller than the value reported here because of the coarse spectral resolution of our measurements .",
    "detection of br @xmath1 emission inside the innermost dust radius suggests that the disk is optically thin in the inner region where atomic hydrogen gas exists .",
    "this article reports the first milliarcsecond angular resolution observations of a haebe star ( mwc  419 ) providing l - band , as well as simultaneously obtained k - band data , both spectrally dispersed .",
    "this multi - wavelength observational capability is well suited to probing the temperature distribution in the inner regions of yso disks , which is very important for distinguishing between models and gaining insight into the three dimensional geometry of the inner disk .",
    "such measurements could distinguish discrete spatial distributions , such as dust - rims , from relatively - smooth spatial distributions , such as classical accretion disks , based on their distinct wavelength dependent disk sizes .",
    "in addition , interferometric measurements in the relatively unexplored l - band provide needed constraints to the disk / envelope geometry and temperature structure .",
    "simple geometrical pole - on disk models are used to infer a linear relationship between the derived object size and wavelength in the 2 - 4 @xmath0 m region , suggesting a simple physical model for the disk .",
    "the steep slopes of these linear relations imply that the disk is extended with a radial temperature gradient .",
    "we find that the accretion disk model of hillenbrand ( 1992 ) derived from sed analysis does not fit our interferometric measurements .",
    "an updated accretion disk model with accretion rate 1.5 times larger and inner cavity 2.4 times larger fits the k band data well , but lies 3@xmath48 above the l band data .",
    "however , both of these classical accretion disk models predict an unrealistically large accretion rate of @xmath7 3@xmath4610@xmath47 m@xmath6 yr@xmath4 to fit the sed data .",
    "a power law temperature profile with a slightly shallower slope of -0.71 fits both the spectrally dispersed interferometric measurements and the sed satisfactorily , suggesting a relatively flat disk geometry for mwc  419 .",
    "the measured disk size at br @xmath1 reveals the presence of compact emitting hydrogen gas in the inner regions of the disk . a more complete sample of yso disk observations with adequate wavelength and ( u , v ) coverage , plus detailed radiative transfer modeling , are required to address the intriguing inner disk geometry in these sources",
