    "in the abelian sandpile model , items are randomly assigned to discrete locations on the sandpile until a critical slope , or number of items . at this point ,",
    "the locations that have a slope greater than the critical slope redistribute their items in a cascading fashion onto neighboring locations @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "consider an abelian sandpile described by a closed circle made of n vertices .",
    "randomly distributed among the n vertices are k items , representing an initial distribution . with the goal of distributing the items among the vertices such that no vertex has more than 1 item placed on it , called the terminal set , any vertex a with more than 1 item has 2 items removed from it , with 1 item moving to the vertex right of vertex a and the other moving to the vertex to the left of vertex a. for @xmath5",
    ", the terminal set is reached after a finite number of turns and for @xmath6 , the terminal set is never reached . for @xmath7 ,",

    ", an @xmath10 circle can be represented by the set : @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where vertex @xmath13 is connected to vertex @xmath14 and vice - versa and @xmath15 is finite @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "since each set is a cyclic order , the following is also true :    @xmath17    @xmath18    , which is really just the equivalent of stating that the circle s order is independent of how you rotate it in space , and so the cyclic ordered set representing the circle .    for any @xmath8",
    ", the terminal set is reached when an equal distribution of items among all of the vertices is achieved , i.e. where each vertex has 1 item .. ] the first step in determining which initial distributions are successful is to enumerate all possible initial distributions between the set where all items are grouped in one vertex , @xmath19 , and the terminal set @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "another way of representing the possible distributions of k in n positions where 0 s and permutations are allowed is the @xmath23 @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "for example , all initial distributions for @xmath25 are :    @xmath26 @xmath27    the only initial distributions from this weak composition that reach the terminal set in a finite number of turns are : @xmath28 .",
    "these successful initial distributions yield the terminal set after a finite number of turns greater than or equal to 0 and thus include the terminal set . using this system ,",
    "the original algorithm is : @xmath29 .",
    "* conjecture 1.0 : * all successful initial distributions can be classified as the enumeration of all distributions that are a discrete number of reversed algorithmic turns away from the terminal set .",
    "a reversed algorithmic turn can be described as : @xmath30 .",
    "it is possible to see if each initial distribution reaches the terminal set in a finite number of turns with enough computing power by using the algorithm discussed in the introduction .",
    "however , it is impossible to know with the current method whether or not an arbitrary initial distribution will end in the terminal set .",
    "* proof of conjecture 1.0 : * every successful initial distribution has reached the terminal set in a finite @xmath31 turns , where @xmath32 is the particular successful starting position .",
    "it is true then that the non - terminal set described by @xmath33 turns is a successful initial distribution that is 1 turn away from reaching the terminal set .",
    "this is also the case for the initial distribution that is @xmath34 turns away from the terminal set .",
    "in fact , since all turns are of the same type ( any vertex with more than 1 item moves 1 to the left neighbor and 1 item to the right neighbor ) , by induction we can state that all successful initial distributions between the terminal set and the successful initial distribution @xmath35 can be described as being @xmath36 turns away from the terminal set , where @xmath37 .    assuming the successful initial distribution @xmath31 turns away from the terminal set allows for any more reversed algorithmic turns , the initial distribution described by @xmath38 , or the initial distribution that comes 1 turn before @xmath35 is also a valid successful initial distribution",
    "this must also therefore be true for all successful initial distributions described by @xmath39 turns away from the terminal set , where @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , all initial distributions @xmath41 turns from the terminal set are successful initial distributions and therefore all possible successful initial distributions can be enumerated .    *",
    "since this is true for any arbitrary successful initial distributions , all successful initial distributions can be classified in this way for the case where * @xmath8 * and no successful initial distribution is outside of this classification by definition . *",
    "* conjecture 2.0 : * every successful initial distribution shares the same characteristic modulus with the terminal set .",
    "* proof of conjecture 2.0 : * for every 2-number item change in the number of items at vertex @xmath42 , there has to be a 1-number item change in @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the initial distribution described by : @xmath45 , must be equivalent to the initial distribution : @xmath29 , in that they are both successful initial distributions .",
    "it is not enough to know the change in magnitude of each vertex , but also the direction of the change in magnitude of the number of items at each vertex , and so classifying these as successful initial distributions must take both factors into account . taking the sum of the product of the position of the vertex with the number of items on it , we can define the characteristic classification as :    @xmath46    , where @xmath47 is the position in the initial distribution , and @xmath48 is the number of items at that vertex .",
    "this can be proven through basic algebra :    @xmath49    @xmath50 mod ( n)\\ ] ]    @xmath51    @xmath52 mod ( n)\\ ] ]    , where @xmath53 by definition since they are simply magnitude changes in position . therefore :    @xmath54    since this applies to any arbitrary @xmath55 and therefore any @xmath56 , and any change in the @xmath35 turns to acquire the terminal set must follow the @xmath29 algorithm in the cyclic ordered set , * this general proof applies to any successful initial distribution in relation to the terminal set and therefore any initial distribution can be checked to see if it ends in the terminal set . *",
    "any initial distribution s classification that does not equal the terminal set s classification is therefore not a successful initial distribution .",
