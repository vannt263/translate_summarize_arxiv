    "another method that has been used is the quasistatic approach of minimizing the potential energy , while ignoring inertia  @xcite .",
    "we here take the even simpler approach of explicitly focussing on the linear response equations .",
    "this requires solving just a single matrix equation for each numerical experiment , which makes it numerically cheap .    in the following subsections",
    "we describe the procedure to generate our packings  @xcite , and recapitulate the derivation of the linear response equation  @xcite from an expansion of the elastic energy of the system  @xcite , both for completeness and to introduce the necessary notation .",
    "we prepare our packings using a molecular dynamics simulation with round discs in two dimensions .",
    "the discs interact via the three - dimensional hertzian potential , @xmath30 where @xmath31 label the particles , @xmath32 is the sum of the particle radii @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the distance between the particle centers .",
    "the energy scale @xmath35 depends on the radii and effective young moduli of the particles , see appendix  [ app.hertz ] .",
    "the quantity between brackets is the dimensionless overlap , @xmath36 .",
    "using the 3d hertzian potential makes the system a quasi-2d packing of discs with round edges .",
    "we use zero gravity to have a homogeneous pressure , and the radii of the discs are drawn from a flat distribution between @xmath37 , thus creating a polydispersity of @xmath38 around the average particle diameter @xmath39 ( our unit of length ) to avoid crystallization .",
    "the simulation starts from a loose granular gas in a square box with periodic boundaries , which is compressed to a target pressure @xmath40 by changing the radii of the particles while they are moving around .",
    "the radii are multiplied by a common scale factor @xmath41 , which evolves in time via the damped equation @xmath42r_s$ ] , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the instantaneous value of the pressure and @xmath40 the target pressure .",
    "this ensures a very gentle equilibration of the packings .",
    "energy is dissipated through inelastic collisions and a drag force which slows down the particles .",
    "the simulation stops when the accelerations of all grains have dropped below a threshold which is @xmath45 in our reduced units . this way we generate packings in mechanical equilibrium for pressures ranging from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , in units of the modified young modulus of the individual grains  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a range of contact numbers from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",

    ", we will use the pressure @xmath40 and typical relative overlap @xmath53 interchangeably ; the pressure ( rather than the density ) is most conveniently set in the numerical procedure to generate the packings , while the overlap enters in the scaling relations at the particle scale that will be discussed in section  [ sectionenergyminimization ] .",

    "it should also be noted that , in principle , the expression for @xmath99 contains both terms @xmath100 and @xmath101  we ignore the latter since these terms are negligibly small close to the jamming transition .",
    "there are three questions that will be discussed here concerning the macroscopic aspects of the linear response of granular packings .",
    "first of all , under what conditions can the system s response to external forcing be described using continuum elasticity ?",
    "secondly , do we recover , in the linear regime , the scaling of the elastic moduli with contact number that was obtained in direct numerical simulations  @xcite ? finally , is there a difference in the values of the elastic moduli as calculated from the response to global forcing , using bulk compression or shear , and local forcing , applying an external force on a single particle ?",
    "the work by goldenberg and goldhirsch  @xcite has made clear that stress and strain tensors are well - defined down to even less than the scale of a single grain , using the coarse graining expressed by eq .",
    "( [ stresscoord ] ) . for large enough systems",
    ", they find elasticity to provide a good description of the response of granular media . in this section ,",
    "we analyze the response of granular packings _ as a function of distance to the jamming transition _ , and confirm that the linear response of granular media , when averaged over an ensemble of similarly prepared packings , is well described by continuum elasticity . to do so , we study the response to both global and local perturbations , as described in sections [ sec.bulkdef ] and [ sec.pointresp ] , respectively",
    ". a fit of the ensemble averaged stresses and displacements provides the elastic moduli of the packings , which we find to scale consistently with earlier results @xcite .          the conventional way to extract elastic constants of a packing is to apply a compression or shear deformation to the entire system . in packings with periodic boundaries",
    "this is done by imposing a relative displacement on all bonds that cross the boundary of the periodic box , following a procedure that is similar to the lees - edwards boundary conditions employed to simulate uniform shear flows  @xcite .",
    "for example , to impose a globally uniform compressional strain @xmath102 , all terms in the energy expansion of equation  ( [ deltae ] ) that represent a bond that crosses the periodic @xmath50-boundary are changed such that each occurrence of @xmath103 is replaced by @xmath104 , where the @xmath105-sign is given by the sign of @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath107-boundary is treated analogously .",
    "shear deformations are applied in the form of a pure shear , i.e. , by having a displacement in the @xmath107-direction imposed on all bonds that cross the @xmath50-boundary _ and _ a displacement in the @xmath50-direction on all bonds that cross the @xmath107-boundary .",
    "when we write the linear response equation  ( [ responseeq ] ) from the energy expression for the deformed system , the terms proportional to @xmath108 end up on the right hand side of the equation and act like an effective @xmath109 .",
    "the response of the system to this shape or volume change of the periodic box is again calculated by solving equation  ( [ responseeq ] ) for this effective external force .",
    "the elastic moduli then follow from the resulting change in stress tensor according to equation  ( [ stresscoord ] ) with the trivial coarse graining function @xmath98 .",

    "now let us determine the linear response of packings of @xmath113 particles to a force in the @xmath107-direction , applied to a single particle .",
    "the packings are periodic in the @xmath50-direction and have hard walls on top and bottom to carry the load .",

    "@xmath12 and @xmath11 denote bulk and shear modulus .",
    "this equation is the direct equivalent of the linear response equation  ( [ responseeq ] ) , because solving it yields displacements in terms of external forces .",

    "as @xmath142 , we observe @xmath143 , its maximum value in two dimensions . in this limit , the fitting of the stress tensor becomes less accurate for numerical reasons , which is made even worse by the fact that the data become more noisy at low @xmath40 . in the bulk response",
    "we see a similar effect : the fluctuations around the average values are much larger at lower pressure . ] by scaling relations of the form @xmath144 these are consistent with the scalings @xmath145 and @xmath146 which on the basis of previous work @xcite are expected for our 3d hertizan contacts .",
    "the above scaling behavior already shows that we can consistently describe the response in terms of continuum elasticity .",

    "<S> the jamming transition governs the onset of rigidity in disordered media as diverse as foams , colloidal suspensions , granular media and glasses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while jamming in these systems is controlled by a combination of density , shear stress and temperature , most progress has been made for simple models of frictionless soft spheres that interact through purely repulsive contact forces , and that are at zero temperature and zero load @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , this model is ideal for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , it exhibits a well defined jamming point , `` point j '' , at confining pressure @xmath3 , and in the limit of large system sizes , the jamming transition occurs for a well - defined density @xmath4 , which has been identified with the random close packing density  @xcite . at this jamming point , </S>",
    "<S> the system is a disordered packing of frictionless undeformed spheres , which is marginally stable and isostatic , i.e.  its contact number ( average number of contacts per particle ) @xmath5 equals @xmath6 in @xmath7 dimensions . </S>",

    "<S> the nature of the non - affinity of particle displacements ties in with the question to what extent these disordered solids close to the jamming transition can be described using continuum elasticity . </S>",
