    "the evolution of planetary nebulae remains a challenging topic in astrophysics .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pn ) have been observed over a wide wavelength range , from x - ray to radio frequencies .",
    "their complex morphologies and the shaping mechanisms that produce them are still a matter of debate .",
    "companion stars , jets from central stars , magnetic fields , dust tori , and interacting winds are some of the possible shaping agents suggested as being responsible for various pn morphologies , and an overlap of their actions can not be ruled out @xcite .    in general , the current theory of pn evolution",
    "is based on the interacting stellar wind ( isw ) model @xcite and its generalised version @xcite .",
    "the isw model encompasses a high - velocity stellar wind driven by the hot central star that runs into the lower - velocity expanding circumstellar envelope ( cse ) remaining from the earlier asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "however , this model does not account for the shaping , because it assumes that an asymmetric distribution of matter is already present when the wind interaction occurs .",
    "other models take into account the possible role of jets , and have been successfully applied to some nebulae @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the interaction with a companion object , even a massive planet , may provide the necessary asymmetry @xcite . also , large scale magnetic fields , influencing or determining the shapes , might be sustained by a dynamo process @xcite .",
    "the birth of a pn is defined by the formation of an ionisation front , which is itself a shaping agent and could heavily influence the morphology established in earlier evolutionary phases . in this context",
    ", important information can be provided by observations of very young pn and pre - pn with hot central stars , where the physical processes associated with pn formation are still occurring .",
    "the term young pn  is often used in the literature for nebulae like ngc  7027 , which hosts a central star with t@xmath7  k. when we use this term in this work , we actually indicate much cooler objects , which show in their optical spectra only recombination and low - excitation emission lines ( see for example the spectra of some of our targets in @xcite ) .    to investigate the properties of these rare objects in transition from the post - agb to the pn , we have selected a sample of pre - pn and young - pn candidates and searched for radio emission from ionised shells ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the targets were selected from stars classified in the literature as hot post - agb candidates , showing strong far - ir excess and b spectral type features .",
    "the detection of radio continuum emission is a proof of the presence of free electrons and therefore of ionisation .",
    "multi - frequency observations allow for a characterisation of the origin of the emission ( i.e. , different spectral indices point to different physical conditions ) .",
    "the progression of ionisation in the envelope around the star can be observed as an increase in ionised mass with time , which implies an increasing radio flux density .",
    "a few objects have been observed frequently enough to allow for such an investigation .",
    "for example , crl  618 has been observed for many years at cm and mm wavelengths and appears to show time intervals of increasing and decreasing flux density @xcite .",
    "sao  244567 is another transition object that shows a decrease in radio flux density over a few years @xcite instead of an increase , as expected on the basis of its last 40 years of evolution @xcite .",
    "several works monitoring this class of objects in the h@xmath8 indicate that the onset of ionisation may be accompanied by variability whose origin is not clear@xcite , while variability due to stellar pulsations has been found in post - agb stars of f  g spectral types @xcite .    for a better understanding of this particular phase ,",
    "we have observed again all of the targets detected in our previous works looking for radio variability .",
    "six new targets following the same selection criteria of the original sample were also observed in this work , after we detected radio emission from them in a previous observing run .",
    "we observed our targets with the very large array , operated by the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) , at 4.8 , 8.4 , and 22.4 ghz .",
    "the observations were scheduled dynamically and only 5 sources were observed at the highest frequency , because of weather conditions and limited time available in the dynamic queue in our ra range .",
    "the runs at the lower frequencies ( 4.8 and 8.4 ) were performed in june 2009 in the cnb and c configurations , and during reconfiguration time .",
    "each target was observed for about 10 min , preceded and followed by 2 min on a nearby phase calibrator .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was defined by observing 3c48 or 3c286 , depending on which of the two calibrators was observable when the run was carried out .",
    "the same flux calibrators were used in the 22.4 ghz runs , carried out in september ( dnc array ) and december ( d array ) 2009 . at the highest frequency ,",
    "fast switching between the target and the phase calibrator was implemented to allow for a proper phase calibration .",
    "the on - source time was also about 10 min .",
    "the data were reduced with the * * a**stronomical * * i**mage * * p**rocessing * * s**ystem ( aips ) , according to the recommended reduction process : the data sets were fillmed into aips with average opacity correction and nominal sensitivities ( _ _ doweight__=1 ) , edited to flag interference or any other bad points and calibrated along with point weights ( _ _ docalib__=2 ) .",
    "observations performed in different days were reduced separately and antenna positions were corrected with the task vlant . since both vla and evla antennas",
    "were included in the array , a baseline - dependent calibration was performed for each calibrator ( task blcal ) and the solutions were then applied in the usual calibration process , to avoid excessive closure errors .",
    "models of both 3c48 and 3c286 were used at all frequencies to properly set the absolute flux density scale .",
    "maps were obtained using the task imagr with natural weights and cleaned performing a few hundreds iterations of the clean algorithm .",
    "the flux density for each source was estimated by fitting a gaussian to the unresolved source ( task jmfit ) , and the rms noise was calculated in an area much larger than the synthesised beam ( @xmath9100 beam ) , without evident sources in it ( task imean ) .",
    "one source ( iras  22568 + 6141 ) was resolved in two close peaks . in this case the data were first tapered to obtain one unresolved source and then a gaussian was fitted , to estimate the total flux density .",
    "to better analyse the single peaks , at 4.8 and 22.4 ghz the gaussian fitting was performed on maps obtained with uniform weighting ( _ _ robust__=-5 ) to improve the angular resolutiona and distinguish the peaks . in spite of the uniform weighting , at 22.4 ghz",
    ", the peaks overlap ; in this case the task jmfit has been used to simultaneously fit two gaussians .",
    "the gaussians thus obtained are centered on the same coordinates as those at the other frequencies within about 0@xmath10.2 , which confirms that the task correctly identifies the components .",
    "we summarise in table  [ results ] the flux densities obtained and their relative variation per year .",
    "the errors reported in the table contain a 3% absolute calibration error , @xmath11 .",
    "we have compared these new results with the values reported in @xcite and @xcite looking for variability .",
    "about half of the targets exhibit stable radio fluxes and only one is clearly variable : iras 18062 + 2410 . as clearly variable , we mean that at both 4.8 and 8.4 ghz we observe a relative variation larger than three times its error .",
    "variability in at least one band is observed in six targets , if this criterion is loosen to twice the error . since the variations are only in one band , it is unclear whether this is due to observational errors or an intrinsic change in the emission .    for iras  22568 + 6141 , which is resolved into two blobs of emission , we list in table  [ results ] the flux densities of its northern and southern lobe as well as the emission from the whole nebula .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the flux density of the whole nebula was obtained by fitting a gaussian on a tapered map , where the source is not resolved .",
    "the sum of the flux densities of the two blobs does not account for the emission of the entire nebula .",
    "an inspection of the residual maps ( the maps after subtraction of the fitting gaussians ) indicates that about 4.3  mjy at 4.8 ghz and 0.5  mjy at 8.4 ghz remain unmatched .",
    "this means that - besides the two peaks - weak extended emission is present and is recovered by tapering .    [",

    "it shows oh maser emission , lines from ionised elements , and recombination lines due to shocks propagating in its cse @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that two wind components are present in the vicinity of the star ( @xmath13 ) : a fast and an ultra - fast wind ( 1501200 and 2300  km  s@xmath14 respectively ) , both with kinematical ages of tens of years .",
    "decreasing velocities from 1000 to 150 km  s@xmath14 are found in the knots in its bipolar outflow , traced by optical and near - ir imaging over 17@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "millimeter and cm observations trace much smaller structures , likely associated to a circumstellar disk ( millimeter observations ) and a compact ionised region ( centimeter observations ) @xcite .",
    "several models have been applied to this source to account for its kinematical and morphological properties .",
    "a possible explanation is that its pecularities are the result of an ejection variability of the central source @xcite .",
    "@xcite have modelled this nebula with a precessing jet of periodically variable ejection velocity superimposed to a linear increase , which propagates into an interstellar medium ( ism ) previously perturbed by an agb wind .",
    "the velocity variability in their model has a period of 120  yr and a half - amplitude of 150  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the jet has therefore an ejection velocity of the form @xmath15 , with @xmath16  km  s@xmath14 , @xmath17150  km  s@xmath14 , @xmath18 , @xmath19  120  yr , and @xmath201  km  s@xmath14  yr@xmath14 .",
    "@xcite present a general model to shape pre - pn with collimated fast winds ( cfw ) interacting with a spherical agb wind and they compare their results with observations of crl 618 .",
    "they introduce periodic variations of the density and velocity of the fast wind in such a way that the mass - loss rate ( @xmath21r@xmath22v ) is kept constant : the density varies as @xmath23 and the velocity as @xmath24 . in particular , to compare their model to crl 618 they consider a period of 22  yr and a velocity half - amplitude of 150  km  s@xmath14 .    radio continuum data since 1991 are available in the vla archive .",
    "we retrieved the data , reduced them following the same recipe as for the rest of our data , and found a flux density of 0.36@xmath250.04  mjy in 1991 and 0.56@xmath250.04  mjy in 1993 , both at 8.4 ghz .",
    "as shown in figure  [ 17423_lightcurve ] , the combination of our 2001 and 2009 observations with the archive data clearly shows variability of the radio flux density .",
    "unfortunately , our temporal sampling is too coarse to conclusively assess whether the variability is regular or not .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the data are well fitted by periodic functional forms similar to those introduced by @xcite and @xcite : @xmath26    we are fitting four points with functions having three degrees of freedom , therefore the procedure should not be over - interpreted .",
    "both fits give periods around 19  yr ( 18.6 and 18.7  yr , for the dashed and dotted curves , respectively ) , comparable to the periodicity in the model of crl  618 by @xcite , but different from the period introduced in the model of iras 17423 - 1755 by @xcite .    our 2009 observations indicate that the emission is optically thin , with a spectral index of -0.4 ( table  [ fits ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the observations reported in @xcite at 8.4 and 22.4 ghz indicate optically thick emission between these frequencies with a spectral index around 1 . in the cited paper",
    ", it was assumed that no variation had occurred in the source between 2001 ( epoch of the 8.4 ghz data ) and 2003 ( epoch of the 22.4 ghz data ) .",
    "figure  [ 17423_lightcurve ] shows that this assumption is not correct and that in 2003 the flux density at 8.4 ghz was smaller than in 2001 , if the variability is regular .",
    "this does not affect the conclusion that the spectral index was positive in 2003 and likely around 1 , considering errors .    if the radio emission is due to the stellar wind , the radius r of the emitting region depends on the frequency as r(@xmath27)@xmath28 @xcite , in the optically thick regime , as is the case in the 2003 observations .",
    "since any variation in the wind will propagate outwards and the emission at higher frequency arises from inner regions , a light curve at a lower frequency will be delayed compared to one at a higher frequency .",
    "therefore , the value of the spectral index will also vary with time , being positive when the emission is decreasing and negative when it is increasing .",
    "the measurement of a positive spectral index in 2003 and a negative one in 2009 strengthens then the interpretation of the observed variability as due to an unstable stellar wind .",
    "as shown in @xcite , if the radio flux is due to a stellar wind , we can calculate its mass loss rate as @xmath29 and the size of the emitting region as @xmath30 where cosmic abundances , full ionisation , and a 10@xmath31  k temperature of the electron gas have been assumed .",
    "if we link the radio flux to the fast wind component , we can take 100  km  s@xmath14 as its terminal velocity and calculate from the radio flux density in 2001 ( when the spectral index was likely positive ) @xmath32  m@xmath2  yr@xmath14 and r@xmath33  cm ( @xmath34.01 ) , assuming a distance of 5.8  kpc .",
    "the mass loss rate found is quite high for a post - agb star , where values smaller than 10@xmath35 m@xmath2  yr@xmath14 are expected .",
    "nevertheless , large rates ( 10@xmath3610@xmath0 m@xmath2  yr@xmath14 ) have been estimated in the prototypical pre - pn crl  618 , which has undergone at least two distinct episodes of mass loss in the form of a slow wind , in the last 2500 yr @xcite .",
    "also , enhanced mass loss in iras  17423 - 1755 has been found by @xcite , who have estimated that its molecular envelope ( @xmath30.6 m@xmath2 ) was ejected in less than 1500  yr at a mass loss rate @xmath37  m@xmath2  yr@xmath14 .",
    "the estimation of the linear size of the emitting region allows us to improve the calculation of the emission measure and convert it into an electron density of 2@xmath38  @xmath6 .",
    "if we assume that , like in crl  618 , the radio flux arises from a slow stellar wind ( 15  km  s@xmath14 ) , its mass loss rate becomes @xmath39  m@xmath2  yr@xmath14 , with r@xmath40 approximately unchanged .",
    "the lack of multi - epoch observations covering the whole cm range does not allow for conclusiveness .",
    "this source was first studied by @xcite , who had selected it as a post - agb candidate because of its iras colours .",
    "hydroxil maser lines with @xmath41  km  s@xmath14 were detected with the parkes and nanay radiotelescopes by @xcite and @xcite respectively ; the latter detected both 1612 and 1667 mhz lines .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite did not detect the oh 1612 mhz line with the vla in b array at the coordinates of the source , but @xmath37@xmath42 north of it .",
    "it is likely then that the detections performed with the single - dish telescopes are to be associated to this off - set maser , although further interferometric observations would be desirable to rule out an intrinsic oh variability .",
    "@xcite performed optical spectroscopy of iras  17516 - 2525 and found that its spectrum is dominated by nebular emission lines .",
    "they also suggest the presence of a hot central star , based on the similarity between its spectrum and that of iras  19520 + 2759 , which they classify as o9 . in their analysis of the optical spectrum ,",
    "@xcite find that the h@xmath43 has a p - cyg profile , indicative of on - going mass loss , although pa lines do not display the same profile .",
    "furthermore , they detect the @xmath44caii@xmath45 $ ] doublet at 7291.47 and 7323.89   , which leads them to conclude that moderate - velocity ( 40@xmath46v@xmath46100  km  s@xmath14 ) shocks must propagate in the envelope around this star and distruct dust grains , enhancing the amount of ca in the gas phase , which would otherwise be depleted onto grains .",
    "we detected iras  17516 - 2525 for the first time in 2005 and find a strong decrease of its flux density over 4 years ( 11% per year ) , the source having almost halved its emission at 8.4 ghz .",
    "the spectral index between 4.8 and 8.4 ghz indicates an optically thin spectrum , although the detection at the lower frequency is only marginal . in the context of the observations available in the literature",
    ", the radio continuum variability may be due to instabilities of the stellar wind ( i.e. , shocks ) propagating in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "more and more sensitive observations are needed to inspect this target and determine its radio continuum spectrum , to possibly distinguish between an ionised shell and a stellar wind , and to look for a variability pattern . within the uncertainty due to the larger error at the lower frequency ,",
    "our estimate of a flat radio spectral index strengthens the hypothesis that this is a young pn .",
    "this source has been monitored at optical wavelengths over a wide period of time and shows photometric variability on both short ( hours ) and long ( years ) time scales . in particular , the equivalent widths of h@xmath8 and h@xmath47 increase and its optical continuum decreases @xcite .",
    "while the short - time variability has been explained in terms of stellar pulsations and an unstable stellar wind , the long - timescale variations have been attributed to an increase of the degree of ionisation of the envelope , due to a stellar temperature increasing at a rate of about 200  k per year @xcite .",
    "previous vla observations of this target performed in 2003 and 2005 are reported in @xcite .",
    "we have modelled the radio continuum emssion assuming that the central star is surrounded by a shell of ionised gas with density radially decreasing as @xmath48 .",
    "we have calculated a 3d distribution of mass in a spherical shell with outer radius r@xmath49 , inner radius r@xmath50r@xmath49 ( with @xmath51 ) , and density at the inner radius @xmath52 .",
    "the calculation of the average density in the shell links this parameter to the density at the inner radius : @xmath53 .",
    "the electron temperature was set to 10@xmath31  k. details of the radio model can be found in @xcite .",
    "we fit the 2003 data with r@xmath54=0@xmath10.0354 , r@xmath49=0@xmath10.06 , @xmath52=5.2  10@xmath55  @xmath6 , and d=6.4 kpc , which gives us an estimated ionised mass about 1.48  10@xmath0  m@xmath2 .",
    "the nebula has increased its flux density in 2005 and 2009 , as shown in figure  [ 18062_spectrum ] . to estimate the expansion velocity of the ionisation front",
    ", we assume that the cse expands at a typical velocity of 15 km  s@xmath14 ( therefore its inner radius will be 0@xmath10.0364 in 2005 ) .",
    "a fit to the 2005 data enables us to calculate that the velocity of the ionisation front is of the order of 100200 km  s@xmath14 , the typical range for fast winds in post - agb stars .    having the above mentioned values as first guesses",
    ", we now try to fit all of the 20012009 data keeping the cse expansion velocity set at 15 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "we first set r@xmath56 , r@xmath57 ( the values in 2001 ) , and @xmath58 ( the density at r@xmath56 , which does not vary with the epoch ) and @xmath59 ( the velocity of the ionisation front within the shell ) .",
    "then we calculate r@xmath54=r@xmath60 and r@xmath49=r@xmath61 for the other epochs , @xmath62 being the time between the first observation and the specific epoch ; finally , we calculate the density at r@xmath54 as @xmath52=@xmath63 . a satisfactory fit can be obtained if @xmath59=120 km  s@xmath14 ( kept constant at all epochs ) and in 2001 we have r@xmath54=0@xmath10.0380 , r@xmath49=0@xmath10.0522 , and @xmath52=5.38  10@xmath55  @xmath6 , as shown in figure  [ 18062_spectrum ] .",
    "the models allow us to estimate that the critical frequency has decreased from around 8.2 ghz in 2001 to 7.6 ghz in 2009 , pointing to an optical thinning of the envelope , with the opacity at 8.4 ghz ranging between 0.96 in 2001 and 0.84 in 2009 .",
    "the ionised masses are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 m@xmath2 , respectively in 2001 , 2003 , 2005 , and 2009 .",

    "the mismatch between the two data sets in figure  [ 18062_lightcurve ] is likely due to an optical - depth effect .",

    "when the radio flux density is optically thick , its observed value will be smaller than that calculated from the h@xmath47 flux ; on the contrary , when it is optically thin , it will be larger than the value calculated from the h@xmath47 , because of absorption at optical wavelengths .",

    "since the source is known to be extended and we observed it with an interforometer in different array configurations , missing flux could be the reason of the apparent variability .",

    "the corresponding decay times for electron recombination are @xmath99  yr @xcite , then about 3.8 and 4.2 years for the n and s blobs respectively . for the northern peak , which is partly resolved in our observations , we also calculate the ultraviolet luminosity necessary to produce the observed radio flux density as done for iras  18062 + 2410 . in this case , we calculate the luminosity necessary if the star were at the centre of the blob , assuming the emitting volume is a sphere whose radius equals the geometric mean of the semiaxes from the gaussian fit .",
    "we obtain @xmath100  photons  s@xmath14 . because of the geometry of the source ,",
    "this is to be regarded as a lower limit to the stellar uv luminosity , since the photons ionising the blob are only a fraction of all those emitted by the central star , and many may also be absorbed by circumstellar dust . by interpolation of the values in @xcite for class iii , this gives us a lower limit of 24600 k for the temperature of the central star , slightly larger than what estimated by @xcite .",
    "this lower limit points out a possible rapid increase of the temperature of the central star .",
    "our observations confirm that this object has started its pn evolutionary phase .",
    "the transition from post - agb stars to pn is a crucial point of the evolution of intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the development of an ionisation front determines major changes in the circumstellar environment and may contribute to the shaping of these intriguing sources .",
    "winds and jets are among the agents responsible for the early shaping of the nebulae during the early post - agb phase , if not even before .",
    "the ionisation of the envelope gives us the possibility to study the action of these agents around the star .",
    "observations at optical wavelengths have pointed out that hot post - agb stars show photometric variability , which in some instances has a quasi - periodic pattern @xcite .    within our sample of pre- and young pn , we have found that 4 of our targets exhibit radio - continuum variability . in iras  18062 + 2410 , the variability consists in a steadily increasing flux density , while in iras  17423 - 1755 it may follow a periodic pattern .",
    "the remaining two variable sources , namely iras  17516 - 2525 and 22568 + 6141 , have both decreased their flux densities of about 10% per year over a 4-year time .",
    "the cause of such a decrease is not clear .",
    "they may follow a variability pattern similar to iras  17423 - 1755 , but in this source the variability occurs in a very compact region around the central star , while in iras  22568 + 6141 it involves two regions likely @xmath31.5@xmath10 away from the star ( @xmath101  cm at 6  kpc ) .    in near - ir images , the central star in iras  22568 + 6141 appears completely obscured , which implies the presence of a thick circumstellar region of dust and molecular gas . even at cm wavelengths",
    ", we do not detect any central emission , although this may be an angular resolution issue .",
    "we can speculate that this obscuring region is in fact a circumstellar disk and the two radio blobs are due to the action of a collimated wind onto the circumstellar nebula . in this scenario ,",
    "if the wind slows down , fewer photons per second will reach the cse . because of the high density , the decay time is short and then the radio flux will decrease , as a result of recombinations . in an alternative scenario",
    ", we can imagine that the central star is rapidly increasing its temperature , producing more and more photons at shorter wavelengths . in the blackbody approximation ,",
    "the radiation from the central star peaks around 1207   , if t@xmath102=24000  k. down to about 600    for silicates and 800    for amorphous carbon , the dust absorption coefficient increases with decreasing wavelength , therefore the hardening of the radiation from the central star would suffer stronger dust absorption determining a decrease of the ionization degree and of the observed radio flux density , until the radiation manages to destroy the dust grains . a decrease in radio continuum emission over a few years",
    "might then indicate a fast increase in stellar temperature .",
    "variability may be present in several other targets in the sample , although the data do not allow for any conclusive statement .",
    "similar results have been obtained for other stars transiting between the late post - agb and the pn phases , such as crl  618 @xcite and sao  244567 @xcite .    while a linear increase in time of the flux density points out to the progression of the ionisation front in the envelope",
    ", quasi - periodic patterns may indicate the presence of jets or instabilities of the stellar wind ( i.e. , shocks ) .",
    "several models invoke instabilities and episodic ejections , or quasi - periodic variability .",
    "the mhd simulations in @xcite show that the collimated outflow can be subject to instabilities and form blobs ( i.e. , the knots observed in pre - pn ) , or an episodic jet can be produced by periodic variations of the magnetic field .",
    "such instabilities typically have much longer time - scales than what observed in our targets and can not be linked directly to our ( relatively ) short - term variations .    [ lastpage ]",
