    "this note concerns the following geometric construction .",
    "let @xmath0 be an oriented @xmath1-gon in the plane and let @xmath2 be a point not on the sides of @xmath3 ( or their extensions ) .",
    "one has a triangulation of @xmath3 by @xmath1 oriented triangles @xmath4 where the index is understood cyclically mod @xmath1 ; let @xmath5 be the circumcenter of the @xmath6th triangle and @xmath7 its signed area .",
    "then the sum @xmath8 is the signed area @xmath9 of the polygon ; we assume that @xmath10 .",
    "consider the weighted sum of the circumcenters @xmath11 we call this point the _ circumcenter of mass _ of the polygon ; we shall show that it does not depend on the choice of the point @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , we break @xmath3 into triangles @xmath12 and replace each such triangle with a point - mass equal to its area and located at its circumcenter",
    ". then @xmath13 is the center of mass of these point - masses , see figure [ defn ] .",
    "we learned about this construction from @xcite where this center is mentioned as a point invariant under the transformation of the polygon called _",
    "recutting_. in @xcite , we proved that the circumcenter of mass is invariant under another map , called the _ discrete bicycle _ ( or discrete darboux ) transformation ; see @xcite .",
    "although our motivation comes from the study of these discrete dynamical systems , we believe that the circumcenter of mass is an interesting geometric construction and it deserves attention on its own right .    if one replaces the circumcenter of a triangle by its centroid then , instead of @xmath13 , one obtains the center of mass of a polygon @xmath3 ( more precisely , of the homogeneous lamina bounded by @xmath3 ) , which we denote by @xmath14 .    in the case of @xmath14 ,",
    "one may safely allow degenerate triangles , whose centroids are well defined and whose areas vanish , and which consequently do not contribute to the sum",
    ". however , not all degenerate triangles are allowed in the definition of the circumcenter of mass : although their areas vanish , their circumcenters may lie at infinity , in which case formula ( [ defccm ] ) fails to make sense .",
    "this discontinuity with respect to the location of point @xmath2 is a subtle point of the definition of @xmath13 .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows . in section [ welldef ]",
    ", we prove that the definition of the circumcenter of mass is correct , that is , does not depend on the choice of the point @xmath2 .    in section [ prop ]",
    ", we establish a number of properties of the circumcenter of mass :    1 .",
    "the circumcenter of mass satisfies the archimedes lemma : if a polygon is a union of two smaller polygons , then the circumcenter of mass of the compound polygon is a weighted sum of the circumcenters of mass of the two smaller polygons . as a consequence",
    ", one may use any triangulation of @xmath3 to define @xmath13 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath3 is an equilateral polygon then @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   one can naturally extend the notion of the circumcenter of mass to smooth curves .",
    "however , this continuous limit of the circumcenter of mass coincides with the center of mass of the lamina bounded by the curve .",
    "we start section [ other ] with the observation that one can replace the circumcenter or the centroid of a triangle by their affine combination and define a new  center \" of a polygon .",
    "the affine combinations of the circumcenter and the centroid of a triangle form the euler line of the triangle .",
    "this line contains a number of other interesting points , for example , the orthocenter . applying our triangulation construction to a polygon @xmath3",
    "yields a line that we call the generalized euler line of @xmath3 .",
    "we investigate whether there are other natural assignments of  centers \" to polygons , satisfying natural properties : the center depends analytically on the polygon , commutes with dilations , and satisfies the archimedes lemma .",
    "we show that all such centers are points of the generalized euler line .",
    "we also show that the euler line is sensitive to symmetries , both euclidean ( reflections , rotations ) , and others , such as equilateralness .    in section [ highdim ]",
    ", we show that the construction of the circumcenter of mass extends to simplicial polyhedra in @xmath16 in a rather straightforward manner . in section [ sphere ] , we extend our constructions to the spherical and hyperbolic geometries .",
    "whenever possible , we try to provide both geometric and algebraic proofs , so some statements in this paper are given multiple proofs .    _",
    "a historical note_. after this paper was finished , we learned from b. grnbaum that the notion of the circumcenter of mass appeared in the book by laisant @xcite under the name  pseudo - centre \" ; the discovery is credited to the italian algebraic geometer giusto bellavitis .",

    "we wish to show that parallel translation of the point @xmath2 through some vector results in translating @xmath13 by the same vector .",
    "let the translation vector be @xmath64 , that is , @xmath65 let us compute the formula of proposition [ coord ] in terms of @xmath66 .",
    "the area @xmath9 is translation invariant .",

    "it is : @xmath69 where @xmath70 are polynomials in @xmath71 .",

    "one has three possibilities for the vector ( [ multid ] ) : it may be space - like , time - like , or null . in the first case ,",
    "the line spanned by this vector intersects the upper sheet of the hyperboloid @xmath312 , and we obtain a point of the hyperbolic plane . in the last case",

    "this issue is already present in the case of a triangle .",
    "the intersection of the upper sheet of the hyperboloid @xmath312 with an affine plane may be a closed curve , disjoint from the null cone @xmath315 ; it may be a closed curve tangent to the null cone ; or it may be an open curve intersecting the null cone .",
    "a triangle is circumscribed by a curve of constant curvature , the intersection of the hyperboloid @xmath312 with the plane of the triangle .",
    "if the curvature is greater than one , this curve is a circle ; if the curvature equals one , it is a horocycle ; and if the curvature is less than one , the curve is an equidistant curve .",
    "these three cases correspond to the three relative positions of the plane and the null cone .",
    "all three types of curves are represented by circles in the poincar disc model .",
    "in the first case , the circle lies inside the poincar disc , in the second it is tangent to the boundary , and in the third it intersects the boundary . only in the first case",
    "the center of the circumcenter of a triangle is a point of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "a proof that the bicycle ( darboux ) transformation @xcite preserves the ccm of triangles and quadrilaterals in spherical and hyperbolic geometry is entirely analogous to the one in euclidean space .",
    "this fact and conservation of area under the transformation allows to fully describe the dynamics of these polygons under the bicycle transformation .    .",
