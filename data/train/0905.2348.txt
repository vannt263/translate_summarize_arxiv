    "according to recent cosmological observations , based on supernovae ia @xcite and cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite probes , as well as to wmap data @xcite , the universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion . in order to explain this unexpected behavior",
    ", one can modify the gravitational theory @xcite , or construct various `` field '' models of dark energy .",
    "the most studied models of the literature consider a canonical scalar field ( quintessence ) @xcite , a phantom field , that is a scalar field with a negative sign of the kinetic term @xcite , or the combination of quintessence and phantom in a unified model named quintom @xcite .    in such field dark energy scenarios",
    "the potential choice plays a central role in the determination of the cosmological evolution .",
    "however , one can acquire potential - independent , general behavior under the assumption of slow - roll conditions , which can be embedded in a potential chosen to be nearly flat .",
    "these potentials have been shown to present interesting cosmological features , especially in the case where the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath2 is around @xmath3 .",
    "although there is not a concrete proof , there are many arguments indicating that in the sub - class of `` field '' dark energy models , nearly flat potentials are perhaps a natural and simple way of preserving @xmath4 , either in quintessence @xcite or phantom @xcite case ( although a sufficiently large hubble friction could also lead to such a @xmath2 for arbitrary potentials ) .",
    "finally , we mention that nearly flat potentials , which keep the variations of the scalar fields from their initial to their present values small , can also be efficient to avoid unknown quantum gravity effects @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in all quintessence models with nearly flat potentials , the evolution of @xmath2 converges to a common behavior and can be described by a unique expression , which can be approximately given analytically in terms of its present value together with the value of dark - energy density parameter at present . in @xcite",
    "this result was extended to phantom models , while the generalization to quintom scenario was performed in @xcite where a universal expression for @xmath2 was also extracted , allowing for a crossing of @xmath3 .",
    "recently , a similar study with a minimally coupled , tachyon - type scalar field was implemented in@xcite , resulting exactly at the same equation of state with the one obtained for a standard minimally coupled scalar field @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "dark energy models where the fields are non - minimally coupled to gravity @xcite have been shown to present significant cosmological features @xcite . in our recent work",
    "@xcite we investigated non - minimal quintessence with nearly - flat potential , in the context of brans - dicke framework . under a conformal transformation it becomes a coupled quintessence model and a universal expression for @xmath2",
    "can be extracted , depending additionally on the coupling parameter .    in the present work we are interested in studying both quintessence and phantom scenarios with nearly - flat potential , in the general non - minimal framework .",
    "the plan of the work is as follows : in section [ model ] we present the non - minimally quintessence and phantom models and we extract the approximated general solutions for the sub - class of nearly flat potentials . in section [ discuss ] we compare our formulae with the exact cosmological evolution and we provide the observational constraints on the parameters of the model .",
    "finally , section [ concl ] is devoted to the summary of the obtained results .",
    "let us construct quintessence and phantom models with the field being non - minimally coupled to gravity . in order to incorporate both scenarios in a general and unified way , in the following we introduce the usual @xmath5-parameter , acquiring the value @xmath6 for quintessence , and @xmath3 for the phantom case . throughout the work we consider a flat robertson - walker metric : @xmath7 with @xmath8 the scale factor .",
    "the action of a universe constituted of a non - minimally coupled field @xmath9 ( canonical or phantom ) is @xcite : where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the non - minimal coupling parameter , @xmath12 is the ricci scalar and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmological time .",
    "the friedmann equations read : @xmath13 @xmath14.\\ ] ] in these expressions , @xmath15 is the matter energy density , with @xmath16 the matter equation - of - state parameter . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the energy density and pressure of the non - minimally coupled scalar field , given by @xcite : @xmath19 in such a scenario ,",
    "dark energy is attributed to the scalar field , and thus its equation - of - state parameter reads : @xmath20 where we can equivalently consider the barotropic variable @xmath21 .",
    "finally , the equations close by considering the evolution equation for the scalar field , which takes the form @xcite : @xmath22    it proves convenient to introduce @xmath23 and thus to define @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the matter density parameter .",
    "therefore , the second friedmann equation can be rewritten as @xmath26 the variable @xmath27 is an intermediate one and will be useful in order to eliminate @xmath28 ( using relation ( [ hdoteff ] ) ) from all equations , since , contrary to the minimal coupling case , now we face the presence of @xmath28 in the definition of the dark energy equation - of - state parameter ( [ eos ] ) .    at this stage , we desire to transform the aforementioned cosmological system into an autonomous form @xcite .",
    "this will be achieved by introducing the auxiliary variables : @xmath29 and defining @xmath30 .",
    "using these variables , relation ( [ eq:6a ] ) gives : @xmath31 and thus @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the scalar field ( that is dark energy ) density parameter .",
    "similarly , substituting ( [ hdoteff ] ) into ( [ eq:6b ] ) expressed in terms of @xmath34 we obtain : @xmath35 and then inserting the above formulae into ( [ eq:13 ] ) we can explicitly express @xmath27 , namely inserting this expression for @xmath27 into ( [ hdoteff ] ) we can eliminate @xmath28 from ( [ eq:6a]),([eq:6b ] ) and thus obtain the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter from ( [ eos ] ) as :    where for simplicity we have considered the dust case @xmath36 , although this is not necessary .    finally , noting that for any quantity @xmath37 we have @xmath38 , the cosmological system itself takes the following autonomous form ( see also @xcite for details ) : @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and @xmath27 is determined by ( [ weff ] ) with @xmath42 .",
    "the autonomous equations ( [ sys1])-([sys4a ] ) correspond to the exact cosmological evolution for non - minimally coupled quintessence or phantom models , with the dark - energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath43 and the dark - energy density parameter @xmath44 given by ( [ gammadef ] ) and ( [ omphi ] ) respectively .",
    "we mention that when @xmath45 , that is in the minimal - coupling case , all equations coincide with those of @xcite .    in order to acquire analytic solutions and in particular to obtain an expression for the experimentally accessible quantity @xmath46 , we follow the strategy of @xcite .",
    "that is , we first differentiate ( [ gammadef ] ) and ( [ omphi ] ) with respect to @xmath47 , and making use of ( [ sys1])-([sys4a ] ) we obtain @xmath48 and @xmath49 as functions of @xmath50 . then using ( [ gammadef ] ) and ( [ omphi ] ) we eliminate the auxiliary variables in favor of @xmath51 and @xmath44 , acquiring @xmath52 and @xmath49 as functions of @xmath53 .",
    "finally , we obtain the exact differential equation for @xmath54 as @xmath55 however , comparing to the minimally coupled scenario there is a difference .",
    "in particular , in the former case @xcite @xmath51 and @xmath44 depend only on @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and thus one can easily acquire the expressions @xmath58 and @xmath59 in order to eliminate the auxiliary variables . on the contrary , in the non - minimal coupling case , where the richer dynamics is reflected in the appearance of an additional degree of freedom ,",
    "this procedure is not possible since one has to eliminate three variables ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath60 ) in terms of two ( @xmath51 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "therefore , we make the following assumption : since @xmath60 in all relations appears always multiplied by @xmath11 , which is in general a small quantity , its time variation will not have significant effects",
    ". moreover , we are considering potentials to be sufficiently flat satisfying slow - roll conditions ( see below ) . under this assumption",
    ", the variations of the scalar field with time will always be sufficiently small .",
    "thus we replace @xmath60 by its average value @xmath61 .",
    "doing so , the elimination of @xmath56 and @xmath57 in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath44 can be performed , leading to the differential equation @xmath62 , which is a rather complicated expression .    at this stage , similarly to @xcite , we proceed to the usual assumptions , based on the nearly flatness of the potentials , quantitatively expressed as    @xmath63    first , from the definition @xmath30 and using ( [ slowroll1 ] ) we conclude that @xmath64 can approximately considered to be a very small constant , so that @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the initial values of @xmath64 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "this approximation is also consistent with the @xmath64-evolution equation ( [ sys4a ] ) , since @xmath68 is proportional to @xmath69 , i.e it is very small , justifying that @xmath64 remains almost constant .",
    "the second assumption is that , as mentioned in the introduction , @xmath43 remains close to @xmath3 throughout the evolution , in agreement with observations .",
    "thus , @xmath70 , too .",
    "finally , in the non - minimal coupling case at hand we make an additional assumption that was not present in minimal coupling models @xcite .",
    "namely , since the non - minimal coupling constant @xmath11 is usually a small number , with the conformal value @xmath71 being the one that accepts a reasonable theoretical justification @xcite , we can assume that @xmath72 , too .",
    "under these approximations the complicated differential equation @xmath62 acquires the following simple form : note that in the phantom case @xmath73 and @xmath74 while in quintessence @xmath75 , @xmath76 , thus the combination @xmath77 is always positive and the aforementioned equation is well - defined .",
    "differential equation ( [ dgamma2 ] ) describes approximately the cosmological behavior of the model at hand .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath78 it coincides with the corresponding one of @xcite .",
    "it can be transformed into a linear differential equation under the transformation @xmath79 and can be solved exactly .",
    "thus , the general solution reads :    where @xmath80 is the incomplete beta function defined as @xmath81    it can be clearly seen that in the limit @xmath78 solution ( [ solusion2 ] ) coincides with the corresponding expressions of @xcite ( for quintessence and phantom respectively ) , namely : @xmath82 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to express our result in a form more suitable for comparison with observations , and similarly to @xcite , we will use the relation @xmath83^{-1},\\ ] ] which is the zeroth order solution of @xmath84 , namely @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the value of @xmath33 at present ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "we mention that ( [ oma ] ) holds only for @xmath88 , that is for @xmath89 .",
    "finally , note that one could equivalently use the redshift @xmath60 instead of the scale factor @xmath8 , using @xmath90 .",
    "using ( [ oma ] ) solution ( [ solusion2 ] ) writes :    relations ( [ solusion2 ] ) and ( [ solusion3 ] ) are the main results of the present work .",
    "they provide @xmath46 and @xmath91 , with @xmath86 , @xmath66 , @xmath61 and of course @xmath11 as parameters , that is they give the unique , convergent behavior for the whole sub - class of models where non - minimally coupled quintessence and phantom fields evolve in nearly flat potentials . in principle , one can eliminate either @xmath66 or @xmath61 in terms of @xmath92 ( the present value of @xmath43 ) .",
    "contrary to the minimally coupling case @xcite this straightforward procedure leads to a complicated expression for @xmath91 , and thus we prefer to keep ( [ solusion3 ] ) .",
    "finally , we mention that in the limit @xmath78 ( [ solusion3 ] ) coincides with the corresponding relations of @xcite .",
    "having obtained approximate analytical solutions , we wish to explore them , examining their cosmological implications , and to compare them to the numerically - elaborated exact evolution for a few different models . in fig.[quintessence1 ] we present the behavior of @xmath46 for the quintessence scenario , in the conformal case , i.e with @xmath11 being equal to @xmath93 .",
    "the solid curve depicts the @xmath0-behavior as it is given by ( [ solusion2 ] ) with @xmath94 , while the dashed and dotted curves correspond to the exact evolution for the potentials @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively . finally , we present the aforementioned plots for two @xmath97-values , namely @xmath98 ( upper set ) and @xmath99 ( lower set ) . in all cases",
    "the present value of @xmath86 has been fitted to be equal to @xmath100 and the initial value of @xmath43 has been forced to be very close to @xmath3 , which yields a relative small number for @xmath61 ( of the order of @xmath101 ) and this fact indeed justifies our assumption to replace @xmath60 by its average @xmath61 and neglect terms of @xmath102 .    as expected , agreement is not satisfactory for @xmath98 , but it improves significantly for smaller values .",
    "furthermore , since we have neglected terms of order @xmath103 , the resulting deviation between the exact evolution and the analytical expression is larger for larger difference between @xmath43 and @xmath3 .",
    "these features are valid for completely different potentials .",
    "we mention that the corresponding deviations are larger comparing to the minimal coupling case of @xcite , due to the additional errors brought in by the @xmath104-approximation , but this difference is relatively weak due to the smallness of the conformal value ( @xmath71 ) . finally , in fig .",
    "[ quintessence2 ] we present the behavior of @xmath91 for all the cases of fig .",
    "[ quintessence1 ] , as it arises from ( [ solusion3 ] ) with @xmath94 .",
    "again we see that our analytical expression is accurate as long as @xmath91 is not far from @xmath3 and @xmath97 is small .    from these two figures we observe that when the potential is nearly flat , then all the examined models converge to a common behavior ( our analytical solutions ( [ solusion2 ] ) and ( [ solusion3 ] ) ) .",
    "although non - minimal coupling brings an additional degree of freedom , i.e an additional parameter , the small value of the coupling ( for instance @xmath71 in the conformal case ) downgrades significantly the corresponding complexity .    in fig .",
    "[ phantom2 ] we show @xmath46 for the phantom scenario with @xmath71 . in this case , and due to the `` inverse '' behavior of phantom fields in potential slopes , we expect @xmath105 ( defined as @xmath30 ) and thus @xmath97 too , to be negative .",
    "this was also incorporated in the minimal coupling case @xcite where the authors defined @xmath105 straightaway with an opposite sign .",
    "furthermore , we mention that the chosen potentials are not too stiff , in order to avoid a big rip which is common in phantom scenario @xcite .    as we see , the agreement of our analytical expression with the exact evolution is better for smaller @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the same features are observed in the corresponding @xmath91-behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ phantom1 ] .    having determined the accuracy region of our analytical expressions , we compare our result for @xmath91 ( given by ( [ solusion3 ] ) ) to supernova type ia and baryon acoustic oscillations data . in this expression for @xmath91",
    "there are four parameters , namely @xmath86 , @xmath11 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "as we have mentioned , we have assumed the conformal coupled case ( @xmath110 ) and we have considered @xmath108 to be of the order of @xmath101 for our present investigation . while taking different values for @xmath11 will definitely change our result , our conclusions below are not so sensitive on @xmath108 as long as it is sufficiently small .",
    "this is also one crucial requirement for our analytical result to be valid . with two remaining parameters @xmath86 and @xmath109",
    ", one can relate @xmath109 to the present day value of the equation of state @xmath111 .",
    "hence our aim is to put constraints on the model parameters @xmath111 and @xmath86 . at present",
    ", we have the union08 compilation of the snia data which contains around 307 data points @xcite .",
    "this is world s published first heterogeneous sn data set containing large sample of data from snls , essence survey , high redshift supernova data from hubble space telescope , as well as several small data sets .",
    "we use this data set together with the bao data from sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding confidence contours are depicted in fig .",
    "[ contour ] .    we should mention that while fitting our model with the observational data , we have to do it separately for quintessence and phantom case , since the expressions for @xmath112 and @xmath113 as a function of scale factor are not the same .",
    "this is unlike the minimally coupled case @xcite , where they are exactly identical . in this regard , and from the fitting procedure point of view",
    ", one does not expect in general to have the confidence contours for quintessence and phantom case to match exactly to give a complete ellipse , simply because we are fitting two different @xmath91 . on the other hand , since we have switched the sign of the kinetic term of the scalar field in order to obtain the phantom model , we theoretically expect continuity for the exact solution and the contour to cross smoothly to the phantom region .",
    "thus , the fact that the contours match exactly , as shown in fig . [ contour ] , indicates that our approximate method works well for both quintessence and phantom cases .    as we observe , and similarly to the minimally - coupled cases @xcite , in order to acquire tight constraints on @xmath111 one has to impose strong bounds on @xmath86 , arising from the corresponding constraints on @xmath114 from structure formation data like the shape parameter for the matter power spectrum .",
    "however , with the present data , and although the behavior is richer than the minimally coupling scenarios , one can not distinguish between the present model and a @xmath115cdm one .",
    "in the present work we have studied dark energy scenarios in which the scalar field is non - minimally coupled to gravity and it evolves in nearly flat potentials in order for the slow - roll conditions to be satisfied . for completeness , we have investigated both quintessence and phantom cases in a unified way , having in mind that the later paradigm could have problems at the quantum level ( the relevant discussion is still open in the literature since for instance in @xcite the authors reveal the causality and stability problems while in @xcite the authors construct a phantom theory consistent with the basic requirements of quantum field theory with the phantom fields arising as an effective description ) .",
    "we have shown that all such models converge to a common behavior and we have extracted the corresponding approximate analytical expressions for @xmath46 ( relation ( [ solusion2 ] ) ) and for @xmath91 ( relation ( [ solusion3 ] ) ) .",
    "the smallness of the non - minimal coupling parameter ( @xmath71 in the conformal case ) enhances the validity of our formulae , since it downgrades the role of the additional degree of freedom comparing to the minimal - coupling case .",
    "in particular , the errors are typically within @xmath116 , and are smaller for @xmath43 being closer to @xmath3 and for more flat potentials .",
    "moreover , a comparison with observations using baryon acoustic oscillation and latest supernovae data reveals that the situation is similar to that of a minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "that is , under the present data the model can not be distinguished from a @xmath115cdm scenario .",
    "however , one should note that in our investigation we have fixed the parameter @xmath117 to its conformal value @xmath93 .",
    "keeping @xmath11 arbitrary will make the parameter space broader , which in turn will lead further to less stringent constraints .",
    "in other words , switching on non - minimal coupling it becomes easier to fit the observational data , at least at the background cosmological level .",
    "non - minimal coupling leads to richer cosmological behavior comparing to the minimal scenario .",
    "for instance , although in minimal coupling with completely flat potentials one obtains the cosmological constant universe ( i.e @xmath118 ) @xcite , in the model at hand , even in this case one obtains a varying @xmath2 resulting purely from non - minimal coupling .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to see that non - minimal coupling introduces an `` asymmetry '' between quintessence and phantom cases , which is visible straightaway in the energy density and pressure definitions ( [ eq:6a ] ) and ( [ eq:6b ] ) .",
    "however , even if the expressions are non - symmetric in the two sides of the phantom divide , the observation comparison reveals a non - trivial match of the confidence contours at the @xmath119 line .",
    "this feature provides a physical self - consistency test of the obtained analytical expressions of the present work .",
    "finally , we mention that we have only considered observational data related to distance measurements , depending only on the background homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "an additional consideration of the growth of matter perturbations in these models , can have interesting effects and may help to distinguish between the present model and the cosmological - constant one .",
    "this will be our aim in a future investigation .",
