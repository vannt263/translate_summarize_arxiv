    "the incidence of extrasolar planets is known to be a function of both stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "if the present - day metallicity of the star reflects that of its circumstellar material at early times , then metal - rich discs would be expected to build planetary cores more readily by grain coagulation . the stellar mass may enter if more massive stars have higher - mass discs , as well as in factors such as shorter dynamical times for grains to collide . in the simplest approach , the mass of solids in a disc ,",
    "i.e. the total mass m multiplied by the solid fraction z , may be the relevant threshold for a successful outcome in forming planets or planetesimals @xcite .",
    "these two quantities m , z can be readily estimated using proxies .",
    "millimetre - wavelength emission from dust is rather optically thin @xcite and the derived disc masses in present - day star formation regions are canonically multiplied by a factor @xmath3 to include the gas content inherited from the interstellar medium .",
    "these masses are proxies in the sense that material already converted into larger bodies ( from boulders up to planets ) has little emitting area , and so potentially only some of the orbiting material is represented .",
    "a good proxy for the refractory proportion of material in discs of non - solar metallicity is the logarithmic [ fe / h ] of the host star .",
    "@xcite showed that such a simple empirical model can reproduce the properties of both planets and debris discs around sun - like stars .",
    "the presence of debris indicates collisions between planetesimals , such as icy outer - system comets , treated in the model as a less successful mode of planet formation ending only in small bodies .",
    "both the frequencies and metallicity - dependencies of these two outcomes were well matched .",
    "in particular , forming planets requires a high solid mass to build the core , and so high metal - fractions are advantageous , explaining the strong metallicity trend in the host stars @xcite . on the other hand , forming comet belts requires only modest amounts of material , and many discs meet this threshold regardless of metallicity , so it enters only weakly @xcite .",
    "more complex approaches such as the simulations of @xcite have confirmed that the outcomes of planetesimal formation should depend strongly on metallicity . @xcite",
    "have used a model of disc - masses in solids to investigate the formation of terrestrial planets , finding in particular that habitable examples could be less likely for low - mass stars if they had insubstantial discs .",
    "a recent summary of our understanding of planetesimal growth is presented by @xcite    [ fig1 ]  m@xmath4 or @xmath54  m@xmath6 in solids at solar metallicity .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=321 ]    here our empirical model is expanded to test the planet and debris frequency expected for stars of higher and lower mass , namely a and m dwarfs .",
    "their planetary systems are now being discovered by radial velocity surveys ( of subgiant descendents in the case of a - stars ) , and their debris discs seen as far - infrared excesses e.g. by the spitzer satellite @xcite . here",
    "the m , z distributions are assessed , and while the [ fe / h ] ranges among the stars are all similar , the disc - mass distributions differ markedly , leading to strong changes in incidence with stellar mass .",
    "metallicity data were first compared for different stellar types .",
    "subgiants that are the descendents of a - stars of @xmath7  1.2 - 2.5 solar masses can be identified by absolute magnitude m@xmath8 of 0.5 - 3.5 and b - v of 0.55 - 1.0 @xcite , or similarly effective temperature 5000 - 6300  k @xcite .",
    "the spocs study of nearby stars @xcite yields approximately 100 such subgiants with [ fe / h ] measurements . a ( log-)normal fit to these values indicates mean and standard deviation @xmath9 of + 0.02 , 0.23 .",
    "this is very similar to values for nearby sun - like dwarfs , with @xmath9 of -0.01,0.29 in the data of @xcite . for m - stars ,",
    "the derivation of metallicities based on photometry has recently be re - computed by @xcite .",
    "using data they present for m - stars within 20 pc , and their relation for [ fe / h ] derived from k - magnitude height above the main - sequence , @xmath9 are found to be -0.06,0.24 .",
    "these distributions for fgk and m stars are about 0.1 dex lower than found here ; such small shifts have negligible effect on the m@xmath10 distribution . ]",
    "are so similar that they can not significantly affect planet - building potential around different classes of star .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the disc mass distributions were then constructed and found to be quite different for a versus fgk and m stars ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the masses for the a - stars are from @xcite , in a millimetre - based compilation for young herbig ae objects .",
    "their plot of m@xmath11/m@xmath12 versus m@xmath12 was used to derive m@xmath11 for m@xmath12 of 1.2 - 2.5 solar masses .",
    "since 11/45 of the disc - mass measurements were upper limits , a survival analysis was used to find the underlying distribution , implemented with the asurv package @xcite .",
    "the resulting disc - mass distribution appears rather log - normal in form , and is centred at a mean of 25 jupiter masses of gas and dust . for comparison , this is just above the minimum mass solar nebula of @xmath720 jupiter masses @xcite needed to supply the cores of all the sun s planets . for fgk and m stars ,",
    "the millimetre - surveys of tau / aur and oph by @xcite were used , comprising similar - aged stars to the hae s of @xcite .",
    "since these authors used a conversion of flux to dust mass yielding values a factor of three lower than in @xcite , the masses have been shifted upwards by one bin ( @xmath13log - m = 0.5 ) in figure  1 .",
    "the difference arises from using an opacity at 1  mm wavelength of 0.03  @xmath14/g rather than the 0.01  @xmath14/g found in the detailed grain model of @xcite , which also agrees with recent literature values @xcite .",
    "survival analysis was again used to construct the base disc - mass populations for fgk and m stars , but more of the points are now upper limits , as the discs are less massive than for the hae stars .",
    "there were 57 limits out of 111 measurements for the fgk dwarfs , and 57/106 for the m - stars .",
    "the means are 4 and 3 jupiter masses respectively .",
    "there is also a large tail of insubstantial discs in both cases , which combined with the lower means , suggests that these discs will have much less planet - forming capability than those of a - stars .",
    "the low - mass tails include many class  iii t tauri stars , which may lose their discs early on @xcite .",
    "all this disc - mass distributions are very broad , whereas the metallicity distributions would cover only about one bin on the scales of figure  1 .",
    "since the metallicity distributions are all narrow and similar , the differences in m@xmath11 should be the dominant factor , and the relevant thresholds for planet formation are now estimated .",
    "@xcite argued that if a minimum solid mass is needed to grow a planetary core , then there will be observed examples of giant planets arising from a range of discs with this same solid - mass , but ranging between massive / low - metal and lower - mass / high - metal systems .",
    "the lowest - metal system observed with a planet arises when the solids criterion was met only because the disc was at the extreme high - end of total mass .",
    "the solid mass can then be expressed using the proxy data as @xmath15_{min}}/100.\\ ] ]    the resulting parameters for all the spectral types are listed in table  1 .",
    "the input data on the disc masses are from the references in the previous section , and the metallicities of planet - hosts are from http://exoplanet.eu/. the subsequent columns list the disc - mass thresholds needed to form planets , and the predicted and observed frequencies . for fgk stars ,",
    "the predicted incidence of around 8  % is in excellent agreement with the 8.5  % found in the systematic planet sample of @xcite . for a - stars",
    "the planet agreement is also very good , with around 20  % both predicted and observed . for m - stars ,",
    "the incidence is 2 - 3  % , and the model correctly predicts a low value because few of the discs are massive ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the solid - mass thresholds needed for forming giant planets are here found to be 200 , 400 and 650  m@xmath16 for a , fgk and m spectral types respectively ( table  1 ) .",
    "this trend qualitatively matches the expectation that grains will coagulate more readily in discs around more massive stars , as the dynamical ( orbital ) times are shorter .",
    "subsets of different types of planetary systems are not considered in detail here .",
    "rocky ` super - earth ' planets form a small part of the fgk - hosted population ( e.g. @xmath17  m@xmath16 bodies contribute around 0.5  % incidence ) , and the requirements for building such bodies are considered briefly below . also , there are likely to be systems with more gas giants orbiting further out  for example , @xcite estimate @xmath18 for the frequency of two - giant systems , from microlensing results  but these are not included here .",
    "the analysis is however self - consistent in using the lowest - metal radial - velocity detection to predict the planet frequency in this type of survey .      for the less - successful outcome of building planetesimals ,",
    "the threshold can not be straightforwardly derived .",
    "@xcite used the metallicity range of fgk debris - hosts to estimate the mass - threshold for building comet belts , but there is little similar data for a and m - stars .",
    "hence the simplest procedure is to infer the threshold from the data . in deep spitzer surveys ,",
    "approximately 19  % of fgk stars have debris discs detected at 70  @xmath19 m @xcite , associated with belts of colliding planetesimals . associating this outcome with discs of lower - mass than those that build planets",
    ", this next 19  % of the m@xmath11 distribution corresponds to @xmath2050 earth masses in solids or @xmath2015 jupiter masses in total at solar metallicity .",
    "this is eight times lower than the value needed for building planets . making the minimal assumption that the efficiency of the planetesimal - building process is similar in all systems",
    ", a similarly reduced value can be applied for the other stellar masses .",
    "discs of at least 25 and 80 earth masses in solids would then be needed for a and m stars to have debris , respectively .",
    "the model results ( table  1 ) show a predicted debris incidence for a - stars that is slightly low , but only at the -1@xmath21 bound ( error on observed@xmath22predicted of 15  % in quadrature ) . for m - stars , there is however an interesting discrepancy between the debris prediction of around 14  % and the observed incidence of as little as 2  % ( table  1 ) .",
    "a few other m - host debris discs have been discovered , but all around stars much younger than typical main - sequence lifetimes @xcite .",
    "it is possible that these m - discs evolve down to lower dustiness than seen among a or fgk stars ( figure  2 ) , but given that fgk and m discs are similar at the t tauri phase , an alternative explanation is favoured .",
    "as m - dwarfs are of low luminosity , dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the star will be cool , compared to a grain on the same orbit around afgk stars . in this case",
    ", the discs will have faint emission shifted to long wavelengths , and this introduces a survey bias ( * ? ? ?",
    "there may be negligible excess above the m - star photospheres at 70  @xmath19 m , and exploratory millimetre surveys may not yet have reached deep enough to detect the discs .",
    "there are some systems known with both gas giants and debris discs , but the statistics suggest the two phenomena are not correlated @xcite ; here in fact it is assumed that they are separate outcomes . in the uncorrelated case for fgk stars , a proportion of 0.08 ( planet - frequency ) @xmath23 0.19 ( debris frequency ) or 1.5  % of stars would have planets and dust , so this should be a negligible population . a small number of planets around a - hosts of debris discs has also been found in direct imaging surveys .",
    "these cases are not considered as a separate class here .",
    "the stability of debris discs over several gyr , in terms of size and mass and largest bodies present , has been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] m @xcite .",
    "the typical upper limit for the m - stars observed by @xcite is shown at the top , and applies for dust at temperatures of @xmath7  40 - 100  k. , title=\"fig:\",width=332 ]      the planetary systems of m - dwarfs are of particular interest because these stars are so abundant in the galaxy . the large solid - threshold inferred for m - stars to form planets ( table  1 ) suggests the core accretion process may be inefficient .",
    "a rough efficiency estimate can be made , assuming the solid content in the giant planets in the m - star sample of @xcite is of order 20  m@xmath6 .",
    "for example , these planets are of @xmath24  m@xmath25 and this is about saturn s solid content @xcite . a lower - mass ` super - earth ' population",
    "is also being discovered of which the most massive observed in transit has a 20  m@xmath6 core plus @xmath710 - 15  % atmospheric mass @xcite .",
    "if 20 earth - masses is a rough boundary above which planets got on to become gas giants , then we could equate this outcome at @xmath26  % frequency with the same fraction of top - end discs , which have @xmath27  m@xmath16 of dust . in this case",
    ", the efficiency of incorporating disc solids ( or at least the millimetre - detected component ) is @xmath28 or 7  % .",
    "one consequence is that to build an earth - mass planet , 15  m@xmath16 of dust in the disc would be needed .",
    "this occurs for around 1/3 of m - stars ( figure  1 ) , so they are not all expected to form earth - analogues .",
    "given that about 3/4 of main - sequence stars are of m - type , at least a quarter of nearby stars could host an earth - mass planet under this simple scaling approach .",
    "however , the disc material spreads far from the star @xcite , so these planets may only be able to form in large orbits , particularly as the hill radius for accretion increases with radial distance .",
    "microlensing is particularly well suited to discovery of m - dwarf systems hosting such low - mass planets in orbits out to around 10  au @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this study to assess how many planets might migrate inwards , to the the habitable zone around 0.1  au where temperatures are suitable for liquid water on the surface . @xcite",
    "have simulated the formation of terrestrial planets , and find that habitable planets of @xmath29  m@xmath16 ( the boundary for plate tectonics and atmospheric retention ) are much less likely for m - dwarfs than g / k stars .",
    "figure  1 also suggests that discs substantial enough to form an earth - mass planet are much more common around a stars , although these discs may also form giants , with implications for the supply of material and stability for terrestrial bodies ( * ? ? ?",
    "the disc - mass distributions for young a and m stars have been constructed and compared to those for sun - like stars . inferring the mass - thresholds for forming extrasolar planets and debris discs , the higher incidence of both phenomena among a - stars or their descendents",
    "is well reproduced , as is the low incidence of giant planets around m - stars , which rarely have substantial discs .",
    "however , only about 2  % of nearby m - stars have debris discovered so far , and several times more are expected .",
    "there may be a population of cool debris discs around red dwarfs largely missed in surveys so far .",
    "the new scuba-2 camera @xcite observing at 450 and 850  @xmath19 m will be ideally matched to cold dust , as is the highly sensitive herschel satellite @xcite , now observing out to 500  @xmath19 m .",
    "a further prediction of the empirical calculations is that about a third of m - stars have the capability to form a 1 earth - mass planet  however , such planets are likely to form far from the star , as the disc material is very spread - out .",
    "i thank sean raymond for very useful discussions , an anonymous referee for helpful comments that improved the clarity of the paper , and stfc for a fellowship in support of this work .",
