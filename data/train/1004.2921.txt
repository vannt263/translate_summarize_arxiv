    "the decay of metastable vacuum states has been of great interest since several decades . since the literature addressing",
    "this topic is enormous , we want to mention only some of the important results that have been found .    in the context of field",
    "theory , vacuum decay was first described using a semiclassical approach in @xcite ; later on , gravitational effects on and of vacuum decay have been studied in @xcite . the influence of finite temperature on vacuum decay has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "based on quantum tunneling , important cosmological models were proposed , for example eternal inflation @xcite , the hartle - hawking - instanton @xcite or the hawking - moss instanton@xcite . the quantum creation of topological defects , e.g. strings and branes in a fixed space - time ,",
    "have been discussed in @xcite .    in the last years , several authors have suggested that string theory in four dimensions might have as many as @xmath0 different vacua @xcite .",
    "all these vacua considered in string theory are local minima of a very complicated potential , resulting from the huge amount of possible compactifications of the ten - dimensional , respectively eleven - dimensional theory , to four dimensions . in this context",
    "the tunneling between different local minima is of great importance .",
    "many of the findings concerning quantum tunneling are based on the high symmetries of minkowski and de sitter space - time .",
    "coleman considered tunneling of scalar fields in a minkowski background @xcite and in a closed de sitter universe @xcite . in both cases , the @xmath1-symmetry after wick rotation has been used explicitely .    here",
    "we want to generalize results of vacuum decay in curved backgrounds to various @xmath2-symmetric settings .",
    "although the chosen background is determined by einstein s equation , we neglect the backreaction of the ( time - dependent ) vacuum energy distribution on the curvature scalar .",
    "the decay of metastable vacua is usually treated in the instanton picture which is of great success @xcite .",
    "one assumes that the scalar field is initially located in a false vacuum @xmath3 and tunnels through a barrier into the true vacuum @xmath4 . in order to make the problem tractable ,",
    "the field theoretical problem is reduced to a quantum mechanical problem by means of symmetry considerations .",
    "both vacua denote classical minima of the potential and have to be distinguished from the quantum mechanical ground state , which is given by the symmetric superposition of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "one may ask under what circumstances it is allowed to ignore quantum mechanical superpositions by considering only localized , i.e. `` classical '' , vacuum states .",
    "analogous to this situation would be the localization of chiral molecules in left - handed or right - handed states , although under certain circumstances , a superposition between both can be observed @xcite .",
    "the localization of quantum states can only be justified with the influence of a system - environment interaction ; therefore one aim of this paper will be to investigate the influence of decoherence on vacuum tunneling . in the context of tunneling in the cosmic landscape",
    ", the influence of decoherence will be studied in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we summarize known results of vacuum decay .",
    "we then present in section [ sec3 ] some exact solutions of tunneling in fixed backgrounds .",
    "the influence of decoherence on tunneling and the decay rate will be discussed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the starting point is a scalar field theory @xmath5 where the potential @xmath6 is assumed to have two local minima .",
    "the difference between the energy densities in the localized vacua is denoted by @xmath7 .    the euclidean version of feynman s path integral describing the transition from @xmath3 to @xmath4 reads @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the euclidean time",
    ", @xmath10 is the hamiltonian corresponding to the action ( [ 1 ] ) and @xmath11 is the normalization of the path integral . the right hand side of equation ( [ euclid ] ) can be evaluated in the semiclassical limit .",
    "it follows , that the tunneling rate at lowest order is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the classical tunneling action and @xmath14 includes the one - loop corrections @xcite .",
    "initially the field is constant in space , adopting the value @xmath3 .",
    "this situation is quantum mechanically unstable since the field can tunnel through the barrier . due to the nucleation process ,",
    "spatial regions with the field value @xmath4 are created spontaneously within the initial configuration .",
    "assuming @xmath1-invariance of the tunneling solution , the field theoretical problem reduces to a quantum mechanical problem with a single degree of freedom @xmath15 depending on the four - dimensional radius @xmath16 . the effective particle moves in a potential @xmath17 from the false vacuum @xmath3 to the true vacuum @xmath4 .",
    "following coleman @xcite , the simplified euclidean action following from ( [ 1 ] ) reads @xmath18 the first term in ( [ 2 ] ) is a volume term originating from the field @xmath15 staying near @xmath3 until a very large `` time '' @xmath16 .",
    "the second term arises from the transition of the particle from @xmath3 to @xmath4 around the `` time '' @xmath16 where the soliton action @xmath19 depends on the concrete shape of the potential . in order to end up with a finite tunneling action , we demand that @xmath20 . if @xmath21 , we consider @xmath22 .    the action ( [ 2 ] ) is minimized for @xmath23 , which leads to the famous result @xcite @xmath24 this specific tunneling action is valid in the so - called thin - wall approximation , meaning that the transition time between the vacua is small compared to the nucleation radius @xmath25 .",
    "analytic continuation to minkowski time leads to the conclusion that the true vacuum bubble will expand almost instantly at the speed of light , since @xmath26 it is possible to derive this result without referring explicitely to the @xmath1-invariance of the problem after wick rotation . assuming spherical symmetry of the expanding vacuum bubble , the action consists of a volume term involving the difference between false and true vacuum and an integral over the two - dimensional surface of the sphere . using minkowski time",
    ", the action reads @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the determinant of the minkowski - metric and @xmath29 is the determinant of the induced metric on the surface of the sphere .",
    "the relative minus sign in the action ( [ 4 ] ) is due to the energy conservation of the system : the difference of the energies in the nucleating region has to be balanced by the negative energy of the surface of the sphere .",
    "this allows the interpretation of @xmath30 as surface tension .",
    "the solution of the classical equations of motion coincides with ( [ sol ] ) after the substitution @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast to ( [ 2 ] ) , the action ( [ 4 ] ) can be generalized in a straightforward manner to problems without @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "the geometry of space - time is determined by einstein s equations involving the ricci tensor and the energy momentum tensor .",
    "although any change of the matter distribution will have an impact on the geometry , we will ignore this backreaction and consider the background to be fixed .",
    "therefore we will discard any changes in the einstein - hilbert action due to the tunneling process .",
    "the effective action determining the dynamics of the scalar field is a straightforward generalization of ( [ 4 ] ) and reads ( see also @xcite ) @xmath32 here we have denoted the determinant of an arbitrary metric @xmath33 by @xmath34 , and @xmath29 is the determinant of the induced metric @xmath35 where the @xmath36 parametrize the space - time manifold on the sphere using two coordinates @xmath37 .    in the case of a friedmann - robertson - walker universe with the line element @xmath38 the action ( [ action ] ) adopts the form @xmath39 the conformal time is denoted with @xmath40 and the function @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 for flat , closed and open universes , respectively .",
    "the coordinate of the bubble is given by the dimensionless function @xmath44 and @xmath45 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath40 .    for a given @xmath46 it seems hopeless to find an analytic solution to the highly nonlinear equation of motion for @xmath44",
    ". therefore we will solve the inverse problem : given a radius function @xmath44 , we obtain solutions for a scale factor @xmath46 , among them solutions for physically reasonable cases .",
    "the equation of motion resulting from ( [ 6 ] ) reads @xmath47 in order to find solutions for the differential equation ( [ 7 ] ) , we assume the relation @xmath48 where @xmath49 is chosen such that @xmath50 is positive but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "from here it follows that @xmath51 equation ( [ 9 ] ) has the general solution @xmath52 with @xmath53 the radius function reads @xmath54 although the solution for arbitrary functions @xmath55 is thereby given in principle , the scale factor @xmath56 , given by ( [ 10 ] ) , will have an awkward form in general .",
    "the problem now is to find suitable functions @xmath34 and @xmath55 in order to obtain reasonable scale factors @xmath46 .",
    "de sitter space is of great importance for the understanding of the early universe and maybe also for the future , since cosmological data suggest that our universe is dominated by dark energy with an equation of state close to a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "de sitter space is defined as a four - dimensional hyperboloid , @xmath57 where @xmath10 denotes the hubble parameter and @xmath58 are the coodinates in an auxiliary five - dimensional space .",
    "it is possible to choose a flat , closed or open spatial slicing of the de sitter space leading to three different choices of coordinates . in order to distinguish the conformal times of the different coordinate patches , we denote them with @xmath59 , @xmath40 and @xmath60 in case of the flat , closed and open spatial slicings , respectively .",
    "the flat spatial sections of de sitter space are defined as @xcite @xmath61 with @xmath62 and the conformal time @xmath59 running from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "the line element reads @xmath65 with @xmath66 using the equations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) and the ansatz @xmath67 , we find @xmath68 where the integration constant @xmath69 is greater than zero .    in order to shrink the radius function ( [ 17 ] ) to zero",
    ", one has to continue @xmath59 analytically to the complex plane , i. e. @xmath70 , with @xmath71 running from @xmath69 to 0 . in order to determine the tunneling rate @xmath72 , the action ( [ 6 ] ) has to be evaluated along the trajectory of @xmath55 given by the analytic continuation .",
    "we find the expression @xmath73 which is independent of @xmath69 and coincides with the result already found by simon _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "these authors found the tunneling rate ( [ 18 ] ) by means of a differential equation obtained from ( [ 7 ] ) after some simplifying approximations , whereas here we have shown that the tunneling amplitude can be obtained directly from ( [ 7 ] ) and without approximations . in the limit @xmath74 , equation ( [ 18 ] )",
    "coincides with ( [ 3 ] ) . in the limit @xmath75 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath76 , which is the result for the nucleation of a domain wall separating two degenerate vacua found by basu _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the physical bubble radius is @xmath77 and the radius at nucleation , @xmath78 , is independent of @xmath69 .",
    "since the action is invariant under the rescaling @xmath79 and @xmath80 , it is possible to eliminate @xmath69 .",
    "this explains why ( [ 18 ] ) does not depend on this parameter .",
    "now we may transform this result to the closed spatial sections of de sitter space - time , which are parametrized by @xcite @xmath81 the line element reads @xmath82 with @xmath83 transforming the solution ( [ 17 ] ) to a closed de sitter universe and using ( [ 10 ] ) , we obtain the physical radius @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 the solution with positive @xmath87 has a minimum in the contracting branch of the closed de sitter universe at @xmath88 with the minimal radius @xmath89 the solution with negative @xmath87 has the minimum value @xmath90 in the expanding branch at @xmath91 .",
    "in contrast to the flat de sitter solution , the nucleation radius depends on @xmath10 and @xmath69 .",
    "we have @xmath92 at the nucleation time @xmath93 for the solution with the minimum in the expanding branch .",
    "the corresponding solution with the minimum in the contracting branch adopts the value ( [ 28 ] ) at the nucleation time @xmath94 . for this solution",
    ", it is possible that the physical nucleation radius is _ larger _ than the physical radius at subsequent times ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the nucleation radius is determined by the requirement that the _ comoving _ radius adopts a minimum value for some real nucleation time .",
    "subsequently , one choses the analytical continuation to complex time such that comoving bubble radius shrinks to zero .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is constrained by the condition that @xmath87 given by ( [ 25 ] ) has to be real . from this condition and equation ( [ 27 ] ) , we conclude that the nucleation radius is constrained by the relation @xmath95 in order to shrink the bubble to zero we use complex time @xmath96 , with @xmath97 running from @xmath98 to 0 .",
    "and @xmath69 two different solutions that can be obtained from each other by reflection with respect to the @xmath99-axis .",
    "the marks on the curves label the nucleation radius and the nucleation time defined by @xmath100 . ]",
    "a third possibility is the spatially open slizing of de sitter space using the coordinates @xcite @xmath101 and the scale factor @xmath102 transforming into these coordinates and using ( [ 10 ] ) , we find @xmath103 with @xmath104 the bubble is nucleating at the radius @xmath105 and the time @xmath106 obviously , the size of the nucleation radius is constrained by @xmath107 the analytic continuation of the time is @xmath108 , and @xmath109 runs from @xmath110 to 0 .",
    "it is remarkable that the tunneling rate for the flat , closed and open slicing is determined by the same expression ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "however , this does not mean that the physical size of the nucleating bubble is the same in the three different cases , as can be seen from equations ( [ 28 ] ) and ( [ 35 ] ) .",
    "for the flat slicing of de sitter space , the nucleation radius is independent of the nucleation time due to the scale invariance of the action ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the nucleation radius for the closed and open slicing of de sitter space depends explicitely on the parameter @xmath69 respectively the nucleation times ( [ 29 ] ) and ( [ nuclopen ] ) , which reflects the loss of scale invariance in these cases .",
    "it is also possible to find solutions for a power - law scale factor if one restricts to the case @xmath111 , i.e. two degenerate vacua .    in order to obtain the de sitter universe as a limit for @xmath112 , we choose the scale factor of the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the cosmological time . changing the parametrization from @xmath114 to conformal time @xmath59 , the scale factor reads @xmath115 unfortunately it is not possible to obtain an analytic expression for @xmath116 such that the scale factor is exactly of the form given by equation ( [ 37 ] ) .",
    "we will merely find a scale factor which coincides with the expression ( [ 37 ] ) for small @xmath59 , i.e. large cosmological times @xmath114 .    in order to obtain a power law behaviour one",
    "has to choose for the radius function of the bubble ; @xmath117 which coincides for @xmath118 and @xmath112 with the result ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "the scale factor then reads @xmath119 which has the expression ( [ 37 ] ) as limit for @xmath120 .    using this result",
    ", we can calculate the tunneling amplitude via the instanton action . in order to increase the bubble radius from @xmath64 to @xmath69 ,",
    "the conformal time has to run from @xmath121 to @xmath64 .",
    "we find for the imaginary part of the action ( [ 6 ] ) @xmath122 for @xmath123 , the expression oscillates rapidly , which means that the wkb approximation breaks down .",
    "this is due to the conformal - time parametrization of the scale factor .",
    "note that the tunneling rate depends here on the size @xmath69 of the bubble ; the scale invariance is established only for @xmath112 .",
    "the nucleation of a vacuum bubble has been described so far through an increase of the radius from from zero to @xmath124 using analytical continuation of the time .",
    "one may ask whether it is possible to find solutions of ( [ 7 ] ) where no analytical continuation is necessary for the increase of the vacuum bubble from zero .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing the scale factor such that the tunneling barrier vanishes .",
    "we consider a flat frw - universe and @xmath125 giving the radius function for the bubble to be @xmath126 using equation ( [ 10 ] ) we find @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a hypergeometric function , and @xmath129 is a constant greater than or equal to zero ( see fig.[fig10 ] ) .",
    "if the integration constant is chosen to be zero , the radius of the vacuum bubble increases from zero at @xmath130 , given that the scale factor is infinitely large at @xmath130 .",
    "choosing any @xmath131 , we find that the scale factor and the bubble radius grow from zero starting at @xmath132 .",
    "afterwards , the scale factor becomes infinitely large at @xmath133 whereas the bubble radius decreases to zero at @xmath133 after adopting some maximum value ( see fig.[fig11 ] ) . due to the symmetry of the solution ,",
    "there is also a branch where the bubble radius starts at zero for an infinite scale factor and decreases to zero again at @xmath132 .",
    "therefore we have obtained solutions that allow an expansion of a true vacuum bubble without a previous tunneling process .    .",
    "this solution allows only an increase of the radius from zero , if the scale factor is infinitely large at @xmath130 . ]    .",
    "the scale factor and the bubble radius increase from zero starting at @xmath132 . ]",
    "solutions for vacuum decay in an @xmath2-symmetric background with an explicit timelike killing symmetry are easy to obtain if the center of the vacuum bubble coincides with the fixed point of the rotation symmetry .",
    "the line element of a static space - time has the form @xmath134 where @xmath41 is some function which depends only on @xmath135 . from equation ( [ action ] )",
    "we find @xmath136 where we have introduced the dimensionless radius function @xmath137 and the dimensionless time @xmath138 . from conservation of energy which is due to the timelike killing symmetry , we find the first - order differential equation @xmath139 whether it is possible to find a solution of the form @xmath140 depends on the function @xmath41 .",
    "the imaginary part of the tunneling action is given by @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are given by the two positive roots of @xmath144 .",
    "these roots are exactly the turning points of the tunneling trajectory through an effective particle potential .",
    "since this can not be seen from ( [ 42 ] ) directly due to the non - standard form of the action , we will switch to the hamiltonian formalism .    in order",
    "to get rid of the square root in the action we parametrize the action with an affine parameter @xmath145 , @xcite @xmath146 introducing an auxiliary variable @xmath147 leads to an action classically equivalent to ( [ 42 ] ) : @xmath148 the corresponding hamiltonian constraint reads @xmath149 this gives rise to the potential of an effective particle potential @xmath150 using this potential we are able to interpret the results easily . due to the timelike killing vector field",
    "we have a conserved energy which constrains the hamiltonian to zero .",
    "if the potential is greater than zero , the particle has to tunnel through the barrier .",
    "if @xmath151 for all @xmath55 , the particle will leave the false vacua without tunneling .        .",
    "since we do not consider naked singularities , we discard the values for @xmath152 if @xmath153 . ]",
    "we now consider two concrete cases : the schwarzschild - de sitter and the reissner - nordstrm space - times .",
    "for the schwarzschild - de sitter space - time we have @xmath154 from this follows that the particle has to tunnel between @xmath155 and @xmath156 with @xmath157 the tunneling always occurs between the two horizons of schwarzschild - de sitter space .",
    "the trajectories of the bubble shell after tunneling are plotted in fig.[fig2 ] for different parameters .",
    "we see that close to the outer horizon the velocity decreases to zero .",
    "furthermore , the imaginary part of the tunneling action decreases for increasing black hole mass , since the barrier is lowered for increasing @xmath158 . in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "the imaginary part of the action is plotted for different values of @xmath158 and @xmath10 .",
    "the barrier vanishes completely for @xmath159 our second example is the reissner - nordstrm - space - time defined by @xmath160 if @xmath161 holds , the line element describes a black hole with charge , if @xmath153 , the space - time describes a naked singularity . in the following we want to discard the latter case .    for @xmath161",
    ", tunneling between @xmath142 and @xmath143 occurs only if @xmath144 has three positive roots .",
    "if there is only a single positive root of @xmath144 , we find that a tunneling solution exists only behind the inner horizon and is not visible for an observer outside . under the restrictions that @xmath161 and that three positive roots exist",
    ", we find after some algebra @xmath162 which implies @xmath163 .",
    "the turning points of the potential are given by @xmath164 with @xmath165 in fig.[fig3 ] we plot the classical trajectory of the bubble after tunneling .",
    "the imaginary part of the action for different values of @xmath158 and @xmath166 is depicted in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "so far we have treated the field @xmath15 as an isolated system and considered the tunneling from the localized state @xmath3 to the localized state @xmath4 . however , in general the field could be in a superposition of these two localized states .",
    "if this were the case , one could not justify the simple semiclassical picture of the field moving along a trajectory through the barrier .    here",
    "we will show that the localization of the field in the potential wells can be understood through decoherence due to the interaction of a field with external degrees of freedom in the spirit of @xcite .    the environment will by modelled by a scalar field with the action @xmath167 where the mass @xmath168 is a free parameter .    for the interaction between the fluctuations @xmath169 and the bounce field @xmath15 we choose",
