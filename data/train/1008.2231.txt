    "the phenomenon of superconductivity was discovered in 1911 by heike kamerlingh - onnes in leiden . after he had achieved to liquify helium at the temperature of @xmath1 he observed that the resistivity of hg became unmeasurably small below some `` critical temperature '' @xmath2 k. a sensitive method to measure the residual resistivity in this `` superconducting state '' is to observe the temporal decay of the persistent `` supercurrents '' in a ring , say of pb ( @xmath3 k ) , sn ( @xmath4 k ) , or nb ( @xmath3 k ) by monitoring the magnetic field generated by the circulating current .",
    "it turned out @xcite that the supercurrent does not decay measurably , even after several years .",
    "ideally loss - free superconducting wires may thus be used to build coils which keep their magnetic field for years , after the windings have been loaded with current and then are cut short by a superconducting switch .",
    "thus , dc currents in a superconductor can flow practically loss - free if they are not too large . however , it turned out that alternating currents ( ac ) in superconductors are not completely loss - free , in particular at high frequencies ( rf = radio frequencies , mw = microwave frequencies ) .",
    "there are essentially three effects which cause energy dissipation during current flow in superconductors :    \\(a ) even in ideally homogeneous bulk superconductors an electric field @xmath5 ( with frequency @xmath6 ) is required to accelerate the `` superconducting electrons '' , the cooper pairs of the microscopic bcs theory @xcite .",
    "this electric field also moves the `` normalconducting '' electrons that are always present at finite temperatures @xmath7 .",
    "the dissipated power of this effect is @xmath8 .",
    "\\(b ) when the current density inside the superconductor reaches the depairing current density @xmath9 , the superconducting order parameter is suppressed to zero at the place where @xmath10 .",
    "this means superconductivity disappears and electric losses appear .",
    "this nucleation of the normal state typically occurs at the specimen surface or in the center of abrikosov vortices .",
    "in particular , when an increasing magnetic field @xmath11 is applied along a superconducting half space @xmath12 one initially has @xmath13 when @xmath14 , but when @xmath11 reaches the thermodynamic critical field @xmath15 one has @xmath16 near the surface , thus one has @xmath17 . here @xmath18 tm@xmath19 is the quantum of magnetic flux , @xmath20 is the magnetic penetration depth , and @xmath21 is the superconducting coherence length . within ginzburg - landau ( gl )",
    "theory , valid near @xmath22 , the lengths @xmath23 diverge as @xmath24 , but the gl parameter @xmath25 is independent of temperature @xmath26 .",
    "\\(c ) large dissipation may be caused by vortices inside the superconductor .",
    "these move under the action of the induced ac current , which exerts a lorentz force on the vortices and causes them to oscillate and dissipate energy . at high frequencies",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation is smaller then the range of possible pinning forces caused by material inhomogeneities , e.g. , precipitates or defects in the crystal lattice .",
    "this vortex dissipation then can not be suppressed by introducing pins .    for a flat bulk type - ii superconductor ( defined by @xmath27 ) in thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "it is favorable that part of the magnetic flux penetrates in form of abrikosov vortices when the applied field @xmath11 equals or exceeds the lower critical field @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 ) and has not yet reached the upper critical field @xmath30 where superconductivity vanishes .",
    "the penetration of vortices at an ideally flat surface may be delayed by a surface barrier leading to a higher penetration field @xmath31 ( overheating ) . on the other hand , with superconductors of finite size",
    ", demagnetization effects may allow the vortices to penetrate already at much lower fields .",
    "in particular , for a large film of width @xmath32 and thickness @xmath33 , the penetration field is strongly reduced , @xmath34 depending on the edge profile , see below .",
    "an infinitely large thin film will thus be penetrated by any perpendicular magnetic field component , even if very small .",
    "the puzzling fact that superconductors may carry loss - free dc current but ac currents exhibit electric losses , was explained by the two - fluid model of gorter and casimir in 1934 @xcite .",
    "later , the microscopic bcs theory @xcite essentially confirmed the two - fluid picture , giving for its phenomenological parameters a microscopic interpretation and explicit expressions .",
    "the phenomenological two - fluid model assumes that the total electron density is composed of the density of superconducting electrons @xmath35 and that of normal electrons @xmath36 , which have different relaxation times @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ". historically , gorter and casimir assumed @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 .",
    "as in the drude model @xcite , the drift velocity @xmath42 of each of these two fluids should obey a newton law , @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 the mass and charge of the electron .",
    "the total current density @xmath46 is the sum of the supercurrent @xmath47 and the normal current @xmath48 .",
    "( in all other sections of this paper the current density is denoted by @xmath49 . )",

    "( 2 ) may be written in form of the second london equation @xmath54 .",
    "for the normal electrons one may assume @xmath55 with periodic electric field @xmath56 .",
    "this gives for the normal current @xmath57 defining the complex conductivity @xmath58 by @xmath59 , one obtains @xmath60 for a normal conductor this yields @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and the skin depth @xmath63 . for superconductors at @xmath64",
    "the @xmath65-function in @xmath66 reflects the ideal dc conductivity , while at finite frequencies the inductive part dominates , @xmath67 .",
    "however , the small dissipative part @xmath68 is important since it causes the ac losses .",
    "in the situation with an ac magnetic field parallel to the superconductor surface , the current is forced ( a current bias as opposed to a voltage bias ) and one has a dissipation per unit volume @xmath69 since @xmath70 .",
    "the dissipation is thus proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "the sum @xmath72 is analogous to a circuit of a resistive channel @xmath73 in parallel to an inductive channel of admittance @xmath74 . below a frequency @xmath75",
    "this circuit is mainly inductive and above mainly resistive .",
    "the ratio of the currents in the two channels is @xmath76 .",
    "this defines a crossover frequency @xmath77 hz @xcite .",
    "when the superconductor forms the inner wall of a microwave cavity with incident parallel magnetic field of amplitude @xmath78 , this wave is almost ideally reflected by the wall since a surface screening current @xmath79 is induced .",
    "the small dissipated power per unit area is then @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the surface resistance ( e.g.  in units @xmath82 ) . here",
    "@xmath83^{1/2}$ ] is the general skin depth reducing to the superconducting penetration depth @xmath20 or to the skin depth @xmath84 in the super or normal conducting limits .",
    "for the superconducting wall one has @xmath85 and the absorbed versus incident power of this wall is @xcite @xmath86 the quality factor @xmath87 of the superconducting cavity is thus inversely proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "after the bcs theory @xcite had given the microscopic explanation of superconductivity , the complex ac conductivity was calculated within this weak - coupling theory @xcite . in the extreme local limit ( @xmath89 with @xmath90 = fermi velocity and @xmath91 = energy gap ; this assumption actually is not satisfied for type - ii superconductors with gl parameter @xmath92 ) , in the impure limit ( electron mean free path @xmath93 ) , and for frequencies below the energy - gap frequency ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) the resulting ac conductivity may be expressed as two integrals over an energy variable , @xmath96 where @xmath97 ( @xmath98 = fermi momentum , @xmath99 = electron density ) is the drude conductivity in the normal state and @xmath100 and @xmath101 are some functions . evaluating these integrals for the case @xmath102 ( in units @xmath103 ) one obtains @xcite @xmath104 the dissipative part @xmath66 and inductive part @xmath105 may be written in the form of the two - fluid model : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the quasiparticle density ( replacing the normal electron density @xmath36 of the two - fluid model ) and @xmath35 the superconducting electron density , @xmath108 the quality factor @xmath87 of the resonator is now @xmath109 since the quasiparticle density @xmath110 strongly decreases at low temperatures @xmath26 , @xmath87 should increase drastically . note that with increasing purity ( increasing @xmath111 ) @xmath66 increases but the penetration depth @xmath112 decreases in eq .

    "the frequency dependent surface resistance has been computed by kurt scharnberg within the eliashberg model that extends the bcs model to strong coupling superconductors @xcite .",
    "strong ( electron  phonon ) coupling effects change the amplitude and the temperature dependence of the gap parameter , they lead to a renormalization ( enhancement ) of the quasiparticle mass , which in turn affects the london penetration depth , and they result in temperature and energy dependent quasiparticle lifetimes .",

    "of course , this @xmath274 is a only approximate , in particular at small @xmath133 , for which vortex penetration has to be computed numerically .",
    "anyway , fig .",
    "14 shows that vortex penetration becomes favorable at @xmath284 and that the bean - livingston barrier vanishes at @xmath285 .",
    "the assumption of bl that the entering vortex is long , straight , and exactly parallel to a planar surface is not very realistic .",
    "alternatively , one may assume that the first vortex nucleates and penetrates in form of a small loop , say a half circle of radius @xmath286 , see fig .",
    "the self - energy of this half circle is approximately @xmath287 , putting the outer cut - off radius @xmath288 instead of @xmath289 in the logarithm @xmath290 when @xmath286 is of order of @xmath21 .",

    "the criterion that @xmath294 at @xmath295 yields then @xmath296 which is just the bl result .",
    "thus , the assumption of a penetrating vortex loop does not change much the penetration field of a planar surface .",
    "however , when the surface has roughness with characteristic length @xmath297 , then vortices will penetrate at sharp points or cusps , see fig .",
    "15 . at a corner with angle @xmath298 , the screening current directly at the surface",
    "is strongly enhanced at this corner ; fig .",
    "16 shows this for a superconducting bar with square cross section @xmath299 and penetration depth @xmath261 , to which a uniform transverse @xmath11 is applied .",
    "a rough estimate gives for this geometry an enhancement of the screening current at this corner , @xmath300 , by a factor @xmath301 .",
    "the field of first vortex penetration @xmath264 is then reduced from eq .",
    "( 23 ) by just this factor , @xmath302 .    for sharper corners the enhancement of @xmath291 and reduction of @xmath264",
    "are even larger . as shown in the textbook of landau - lifshitz ( electrodynamics of continua ) for an ideal diamagnetic material at a corner with angle @xmath303 ( fig .",
    "17 ) the magnetic field diverges as @xmath304 with exponent @xmath305 , where @xmath126 is the distance to the point of the corner .",
    "this gives @xmath306 for @xmath307 and @xmath308 for @xmath309 .",
    "similarly , an axially applied magnetic field flowing around an ideal diamagnetic cylinder , sphere , or disks with elliptical or rectangular cross section of aspect ratio @xmath310 , is enhanced at its equator by factors 2 , 3/2 , @xmath311 , or @xmath312 , respectively , due to the strong curvature of the field lines at this line , see fig .",
    "one has to distinguish two quite different types of vortices in thin film superconductors : vortices perpendicular or parallel to the film plane . in wide thin films with width @xmath313 thickness @xmath314 ,",
    "the vortices will nearly always run perpendicular across the film thickness , even in tilted applied field @xmath11 , because of the large demagnetization factor of this film .",
    "this means the circulating currents prefer to flow in the film plane .",
    "only when @xmath11 is exactly parallel to the film surface , or when the film is coating a bulk superconductor that screens any perpendicular field component , then vortices parallel to the film plane may occur .",
    "when the film is of finite size , one may use eqs .",
    "( 19 ) to estimate at which applied perpendicular field component @xmath315 the first vortices penetrate , namely already at a very small field , smaller than @xmath316 .",
    "when the film edges are wedge - shaped or sharp , the penetration field is even smaller , cf .",
    "fig.17 and fig .  18 ( elliptical edge ) . into",
    "infinitely extended or closed films ( e.g. , a nb layer covering the inner surface of a cu cavity ) any perpendicular field will penetrate since the field lines can not flow around the film .",
    "only when this film has holes or slits can some magnetic flux cross the film via these holes , but the magnetic field in the holes will be larger than @xmath315 by at least the ratio of film area over the total area of all holes",
    ". however , the field in the holes will penetrate into the film when it is of the order of @xmath254 times the square root of film thickness over hole distance .",
    "thus , even such a perforated pin - free film will be penetrated by a perpendicular field that is very much smaller than @xmath254 .",
    "the peaked magnetic field , circulating current , and pair interaction of perpendicular vortices in thin films were calculated for infinitely extended @xcite and finite - size ( e.g. rectangular ) films @xcite .",
    "pinning of vortices will not appreciably enhance all these penetration fields at high radio frequencies , where the ( elastic ) pinning forces are smaller than the viscose drag force .",
    "if the small applied perpendicular magnetic field is a dc field ( e.g. , some stray field or the earth magnetic field ) then the additional rf field will even favor the penetration of the dc field in form of vortices , since it `` shakes '' the vortices . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "shaking of vortices by an ac field oriented perpendicular to the vortices leads to the relaxation of irreversible currents if the ac amplitude exceeds some threshold value .",
    "this vortex creep means that even in very small @xmath315 , perpendicular vortices will penetrate under the action of a large - amplitude rf field , and then these vortices oscillate and dissipate energy .",
    "the problem of parallel vortex lines in a thin film with @xmath317 was solved by alexei abrikosov ( 1964 ) , vadim shmidt ( 1969 ) , and in an elegant way by alex gurevich @xcite .",
    "the lower critical field is enhanced in thin films as compared to bulk superconductors , @xmath318 and the field at which the surface barrier for vortex penetration disappears is also enhanced , @xmath319 for example , a nbn film with @xmath320 nm , @xmath321 nm has @xmath322 t and @xmath323 t , much better than the penetration field @xmath324 t for nb at low @xmath26 .    to enhance the operating rf amplitude in microwave cavities for accelerators and reduce the losses , gurevich @xcite suggests to use solid nb or pb with multilayer coating on its inner surface by alternating superconducting and insulating layers with @xmath325",
    "this will prevent penetration of vortices into the bulk superconductor when the vortex penetration field @xmath326 is large ; e.g. , for nbn films with @xmath321 nm the rf field can be as high as 4.2 t. from the elastic and viscose forces on a parallel vortex in a thin film , gurevich estimates its characteristic relaxation time as @xmath327 for a 30 nm nb@xmath145sn film this @xmath328 s is much shorter than the rf period of @xmath329 s. the maximum amplitude of the rf field at which the surface barrier of a single thin film coating disappears is of the order of the bulk @xmath330 of the film material , e.g. , 0.54 t for nb@xmath145sn .",
    "thus , nb@xmath145sn coating more than doubles the vortex penetration field for nb , @xmath324 t at low @xmath26 .",
    "it appears that nb cavities coated with a nb@xmath145sn layer or with nbn multilayers allow for much higher rf amplitudes than uncoated nb , or cu coated by a nb film , if this can be achieved technically .",
