    "the response of such systems to an external shear stress is characterized by two regimes : for stresses below the yield stress @xmath0 they lose their ability to flow , remain jammed , and respond elastically , whereas for stresses above @xmath0 they flow as liquids @xcite . despite this macroscopic shared behavior",
    ", local velocimetry experiments have revealed that the flow of jammed materials is not universal @xcite .",
    "nonadhesive emulsions @xcite , microgels , and pastes were shown to flow homogeneously in the vicinity of the yielding transition @xcite .",

    "the flow becomes homogeneous .",

    "this qualitative study leads to the following conclusions .",
    "the gel is formed of large aggregates composed of interconnected branches or fibers that have grown from the same center .",
    "the size of the fibers ranges from 20 to 200  @xmath7 m .",
    "these aggregates form a network that is responsible for the elastic behavior of the gel .",
    "figure  [ vieuxgel ] shows that the initial gel state is metastable and that the final state ( after 1 week ) is a suspension of independent and unconnected rods which has lost its elastic properties . with time",
    "some parts of the primary gel fibers melt and reform at other places with a different morphology .",
    "the mean diameter of the fibers increases , the new stucture is much less branched , and oswald rippening seems to occur and to smooth out the stucture .",
    "this ageing behavior is similar to the one observed by lescanne and coworkers on n-3-hydroxypentyl - undecanamide - toluene gels  @xcite .",

    "the scale bar represents 100  @xmath7 m .",

    "note that in the following , the rheological experiments will be performed on gels with higher n5hu concentrations .",
    "we shall assume that the structure involved in these systems is similar to the one presented above for lower concentrations .",
    "indeed , due to the turbidity of the sample , we have been unable to obtain optical pictures for more concentrated systems .      to better characterize the nature of the interconnection between the aggregates , rheological experiments",
    "have been performed using a stress - controlled rheometer ( ta instruments ar 1000n ) equipped with a cone - and - plate geometry made of aluminum ( 40 mm diameter , 4@xmath1 cone angle , and 56 @xmath7 m gap truncation ) . to avoid solvent evaporation ,",

    "a gel is obtained and the rheological experiment is started 10 minutes after loading the sample . in order to define the so - called linear regime , the sample is first submitted to a periodic stress oscillating at a frequency of 1  hz and with an amplitude @xmath8 that increases exponentially with time . during this experiment ,",

    "i.e. _ , in the linear regime , both dynamic moduli are independent of the stress amplitude @xmath8 and reveal the properties of the unpertubed gel : @xmath9 is about 10 times larger than @xmath10 which reflects the dominant character of the material . up to large experimental scatter on @xmath10 below 1  pa , both moduli remain roughly constant below a critical shear stress of about 3  pa , which can be taken as the limit of the linear domain . between @xmath13  pa and 60  pa ,",
    "@xmath9 slightly decreases as a function of the applied shear stress . above @xmath14  pa ,",
    "@xmath9 drops dramatically while @xmath10 decreases sharply .",
    "this behavior is due to the partial breakup of the gel .",
    "thus our n5hu gel behaves as a weak gel @xcite .    in a second set of experiments , @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "are measured as a function of the angular frequency ( which is varied from 0.1 to 10  hz ) for a fresh sample of the n5hu toluene gel and a stress amplitude of 2 pa .",
    "this stress falls into the linear regime so that the frequency sweep is nondestructive and the gel structure remains intact .",

    "a slight increase of the elastic modulus @xmath9 as a function of frequency is noticed ( from @xmath15  pa at 0.1  hz to @xmath16  pa at 10  hz ) , which is consistent with a viscoelastic behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "the loss modulus is observed to increase as the frequency decreases .",
    "since @xmath10 should reach zero at zero frequency , a viscoelastic process occurs with a very long characteristic time , corresponding to a very low frequency value ( @xmath17  hz ) .",

    "the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 may vary by @xmath20 from one experiment to another .",
    "this behavior is common to many organogels .",
    "we believe that these discrepancies are related to a dispersion in the aggregate number density from one gel to another .",
    "indeed , this parameter is very sensitive to cooling velocities , impurities , and filling conditions of the geometry which are difficult to control very precisely . after studying the main linear rheological properties of our organogel",
    ", we now focus on its nonlinear rheology .",
    "in this section , we study the nonlinear rheological response of our nh5u - toluene gels .",
    "we first address the question of the sensitivity of these gels to shear .",
    "indeed , most organogels are very sensitive to shear stress which tends to expel the solvent from the three - dimensional network and to break the gel",
    ". when the mechanical excitation is stopped , the sample behaves as a suspension and has lost its elastic properties .",
    "usually , the only way to recover a gel is to heat it and cool it down once again .",
    "here we first present data showing that this is not the case for our nh5u - toluene gels and that recovery occurs spontaneously once shear is stopped .",
    "after discussing _ global _ nonlinear rheological properties , we present local velocity measurements using ultrasonic velocimetry and extract the _ local _ rheological flow curve .      to study the flow properties of the gel and its recovery , we go back to the experiment presented in fig .

    "figure  [ nonlimagn ] presents the storage modulus @xmath9 and the loss modulus @xmath10 measured as a function of time . during the first 480  s ,",

    "we now study the nonlinear behavior of our gel under constant applied shear rate .",
    "as previously , a 4.7  wt  @xmath5 solution of nh5u in toluene is prepared and heated at 50@xmath1c in order to totally dissolve the solid powdered sample . the hot solution is introduced between the two coaxial cylinders of a couette geometry made of pvc ( gap @xmath27  mm , inner radius @xmath28  mm and height @xmath29  mm ) and then cooled down to 5@xmath1c with a cooling rate of about 20@xmath1c / min using an icy water circulation around the outer cylinder .",
    "the reason for using a couette geometry in this section is that we wish to further use ultrasonic velocimetry ( which is currently available only in couette geometry ) in order to construct a local flow curve by combining global rheological data and local velocity measurements .",
    "the same behaviour was observed in cone - and - plate geometry even though the global flow curve may vary a little bit .    using the shear rate imposed mode of the ar1000n rheometer , a constant shear rate @xmath30",

    "figure  [ flowcurve ] presents the _ global _ flow curve @xmath8 versus @xmath30 ( also referred to as the `` engineering '' flow curve in the literature ) where the measured shear stress values are obtained by averaging @xmath31 over the last 300  s of each shear rate step .",
    "waiting for 5  min before starting to average the rheological data ensures that steady state is reached .",

    "can not be observed experimentally since it corresponds to material instability .",
    "thus the global flow curve of fig .",
    "[ flowcurve ] strongly suggests the presence of inhomogeneous flows in regime 1 .",
    "second , for @xmath35  s@xmath32 ( regime 2 ) , the measured shear stress increases as a function of the applied shear rate , consistently with a low - viscosity liquid behavior .",
    "note that , if we repeat the experiments after shearing the system at a shear rate of 800  s@xmath32 for 2  min and stopping the shear for 5  min , we get the same rheological behaviour .",
    "this confirms the thixotropic nature of our gel . to better analyze this striking flow curve ,",
    "we have performed local velocity experiments simultaneously to nonlinear rheological measurements .",
    "our rheo - ultrasonic setup allows the recording of velocity profiles across the gap of a couette cell simultaneously to rheological data with a spatial resolution of about 40 @xmath7 m .",
    "the time needed to record one velocity profile ranges between @xmath36 and @xmath37  s , depending upon the value of the applied shear rate .",
    "this setup has been described at length in ref .",
    "@xcite and only its main characteristics are recalled here . it is built around the stress - controlled rheometer ( ta instruments ar1000n ) used so far and equipped with the couette cell described above .",
    "the whole cell is surrounded by water whose temperature is kept constant to within @xmath380.1@xmath1c .",

    "ms in a newtonian latex suspension sheared at @xmath40  s@xmath32 .",
    "the normalized pressure @xmath41 is coded in gray levels .",
    "the horizontal axis is the ( fast ) ultrasonic time @xmath42 and the vertical axis is the ( slow ) pulse time @xmath43 .",
    "the gap lies between @xmath44s and @xmath45s . ]    under the assumption of single scattering , the signal received at time @xmath42 can be interpreted as interferences coming from scatterers located at position @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the sound speed in the fluid and @xmath48 is the distance from the transducer along the ultrasonic beam ( see fig .",
    "[ f.setup ] ) .",
    "when the sample is submitted to a shear flow , bs signals move along with the scatterers .",
    "two successive pulses separated by a time interval @xmath49 lead to two similar backscattered signals that are shifted in time .",
    "figure  [ billes ] shows forty successive bs signals recorded in a sheared newtonian latex suspension with a pulse frequency repetition @xmath50  hz .",
    "the amplitude of the bs signals is coded in gray levels and the vertical axis @xmath43 corresponds to the time at which each pulse is sent .",
    "the ultrasonic pulses leave the stator and enter the gap at @xmath44s and the rotor position corresponds to @xmath45s .",
    "the slopes of the traces left by the echoes in this two - dimensional ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) diagram are inversely proportional to the local velocities .",
    "thus , the signature of shear is rather clear : velocities increase from the stator , where the scatterers remain almost fixed , to the rotor .",
    "moreover , the presence of moving echoes for @xmath51s is not surprising : these echoes simply correspond to scattering of the wave reflected on the rotor .",
    "one can see that the whole range @xmath5216.0  @xmath7s gets covered by some significant speckle signal in about 20  ms in that case .    from these bs signals",

    "[ f.setup ] , the projection @xmath60 of the velocity vector @xmath56 along the @xmath48-axis in couette geometry is the sum of the projections of the radial component @xmath61 and of the tangential component @xmath62 of @xmath56 : @xmath63 assuming the flow field to be purely tangential , one gets : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the radial position given by @xmath66 .",

    "locally , destructive interferences or the absence of scatterers may lead to signal levels too small to be well analyzed .",
    "to recover a full velocity profile , some averaging is then performed over several successive cross - correlations . typically , on a stationary flow ,",

    "the resulting @xmath105 versus @xmath107 data are plotted in fig .  [ loc ] .",
    "the first striking observation is that the local flow curve is _ multivalued _ :",
    "for shear stresses ranging between 0.7 and 4  pa , three different shear rates correspond to the same shear stress .",
    "the gel may thus adopt three different states for a given shear stress : ( i ) a solid - like state ( @xmath77 ) , ( ii ) a viscous state ( @xmath19 ) , and ( iii ) a low viscosity shear thinning state ( @xmath108 ) .",

    "is observed in regime 2 ( see solid line in fig .",

    "second , we note that flowing samples are observed for shear stresses below the upper limit of the linear regime @xmath112  pa . this simply means that during the experiments under oscillating shear stress , only the solid - like state was probed .",
    "moreover , states ( ii ) and ( iii ) are obtained after a fracturing process which probably requires a certain amount of strain and thus may not have enough time to develop under stress oscillations .",
    "finally the most important result is the presence of a _ decreasing _ branch in the local flow curve ( @xmath19 and @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ loc ] ) . in regime 1 , the shear stress decreases from 7 to 0.7  pa while the applied shear rate is increased from 0.05 to 70  s@xmath32 . usually the apparent shear viscosity is defined as the ratio between @xmath105 and @xmath107 . decreasing branches in the flow curve",
    "are mechanicaly unstable .",
    "it is thus striking to get sound measurements in this zone of the flow curve .",
    "let us recall that the velocity profiles display very large errors bars in this range of applied shear rates , reflecting important temporal fluctuations . in order to get further insight on this decreasing branch , it is thus necessary to focus on the `` instantaneous '' velocity profiles and to study in details the temporal behaviour of the local velocities .",

    "arrows indicate the fracture events.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to better understand the decreasing part of the local flow curve , we go back to the backscattered ultrasonic signals recorded in regime 1 .",

    "[ flowcurve ] at the very beginning of the shear rate step at @xmath75  s@xmath32 .",
    "more precisely , shear is applied at @xmath116  s and 100 successive signals with @xmath117  hz are shown .",
    "once shear is started , a flowing zone is nucleated in the middle of the gap after a few seconds and grows in time until steady state is achieved .",
    "the flow is thus clearly inhomogeneous .",
    "a second very striking feature of the bs signals at @xmath75  s@xmath32 is that the traces in fig .",
    "[ vitlocal005](top ) present sudden discontinuities from one pulse to another , _",

    "such `` instantaneous '' measurements were obtained by cross - correlating two successive signals without further averaging cross - correlations .",
    "although this procedure leads to rather noisy velocity signals , very fast variations of the `` instantaneous '' velocity ( which in this case becomes negative ) are revealed , corresponding to the sudden discontinuties pointed out by arrows in fig .",
    "[ vitlocal005](top ) . moreover the fact that these discontinuities do not span over the full range of ultrasonic times @xmath42 is an indication that `` fast '' events occur that are localized in both space and time .",

    "this apparent `` reverse '' motion of the ultrasonic echoes can be attributed either to some rotational motion of the n5hu aggregates or to some significant radial component of the velocity field .",

    "we have shown that these fluctuations arise either from `` fast '' fracture - like events ( on time scales smaller than @xmath120 ) or from `` slow '' three - dimensional motions ( on time scales of a few @xmath120 ) .",
    "such features are not found at higher shear rates .",

    "[ 005v ] and zone1 t may still be interpreted in terms of tangential velocity .    from these observations",
    "we may propose an explanation for the negative slope of the local flow curve reported in sect .",
    "[ locflowcurve ] .",
    "indeed , fractures and three - dimensional flow features lead to enhanced friction losses in the sample .",
    "since their number and amplitude were shown to decrease as the shear rate is increased in regime 1 , the loss of energy becomes smaller , which could lead to a decrease of the shear stress .",
    "note , however that as we are unable to submit the gel to pure shear flow , it is thus not possible to identify @xmath129 with the shear viscosity for @xmath130  s@xmath32 .",
    "we stress again the fact that the flow behavior along the decreasing branch of the flow curve is very complex since widely different local shear rates are evidenced in the viscous zone for the same value of the shear stress .",
    "finally note that the exact location of the fractures or of the shear bands may depend upon the interactions of the gel with the walls .",
    "experiments dealing with another organogel have shown that the fracture may locate at the wall @xcite . in this case , the gel was not cooled directly in the couette cell but before being loaded into the cell which clearly limits the links between the gel and the cell .",
    "in this work , we have studied the nonlinear rheological properties of an organogel . under small applied shear rates ( regime 1 ) , a flowing region is nucleated in the middle of the gap of a couette cell . increasing",
    "the applied shear rate increases the size of the flowing region .",
    "moreover backscattered ultrasonic signals clearly evidence three - dimensional displacements and fracture - like events in this `` viscous zone . ''",
    "time - averaged velocity measurements show that the local flow behavior in the viscous zone is characterized by a decreasing local flow curve and a very large range of accessible shear rates for a given shear stress . at",
    "higher applied shear rates ( regime 2 ) , an increasing flow curve is recovered but a solid - like region persists close to the stator . when the mechanical stress is released , the fractures heal rapidly and the sample recovers its initial elastic properties .",
    "we believe that the present work sheds new light on the jamming concept and wish to further discuss our results in this context .",
    "indeed the jamming phase diagram suggested by liu and nagel @xcite provides a unified picture of the ergodic - to - nonergodic transition in systems as diverse as clay suspensions @xcite , emulsions @xcite , or microgel solutions @xcite .",
    "this diagram considers the possibility of unjamming the system by increasing its temperature , releasing its density , or increasing the amplitude of some applied shear stress .",
    "although the jamming transition presents some universal features ( universal slow dynamics and ageing behavior have been observed in a wide variety of jammed systems such as colloidal suspensions , concentrated emulsions , and lamellar gels ) , we argue that the unjamming mechanisms are not universal . in a previous work ,",
    "we have pointed out that the flow of concentrated emulsions in the vicinity of the yield stress may be homogeneous or heteregeneous depending on the interactions between the droplets : shear banded flow occurs only for adhesive emulsions whereas the flow of nonadhesive emulsions remains homogeneous through the yielding transition @xcite .    with the present work ,",
    "we bring new elements that corroborate this point of view .",
    "first we have found that the viscous ( or `` unjammed '' ) zone in regime 1 is nucleated in the middle of the gap of a couette cell .",
    "such a location for the flowing material had not been reported before : previous works have shown that , in the vicinity of the yield stress , flow is usually initiated in the region of higher shear stress _",
    "i.e. _ , close to the inner cylinder of a couette cell @xcite .",
    "moreover for shear rates in regime 1 , the flow in the viscous zone is quite unusual with three - dimensional features and fracture - like events .",
    "rotational motions of the aggregates and fractures induce a loss of energy .",
    "these events decrease in number and in amplitude as the applied shear rate is increased .",
    "thus a lower shear stress is required to maintain the flow at higher shear rates .",
    "this scenario could provide an explanation for the decreasing branch observed in regime 1 on the local flow curve .",
    "we also point out that the jammed phase and the unjammed one may coexist over a very large range of shear stresses . in this case , defining and measuring a `` yield stress '' becomes very difficult .",
    "for shear rates in regime 2 , fractures and three - dimensional motions disappear .",
    "although the global flow curve points to a low viscosity liquid behavior , local measurements show that the system remains jammed close to the stator over a significant thickness and for the highest investigated shear rates . in the framework of the jamming phase diagram , this last feature remains rather puzzling .",
    "this study clearly shows that local measurements are required to understand the flow of complex fluids such as organogels .",
    "it also demonstrates that complex three - dimensional flows may occur in viscous systems , even at very low shear rates .",
    "in particular , although restricted to a specific organogel with large - scale heterogeneities , the present work reveals the existence of both `` fast '' and `` slow '' spatially localized events involved in the unjamming transition . instead of claiming for any generality",
    ", we rather wish to emphasize that yielding mechanisms may well be widely different from one material to another . in our opinion",
    ", investigating more deeply the nature of the interplay between the complex local flow behavior observed along the decreasing branch of the flow curve and the three - dimensional motions and fracture - like events revealed by the ultrasonic bs signals constitutes the most promising research direction on such thixotropic systems driven far from equilibrium ."
