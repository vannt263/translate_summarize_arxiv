    "the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ; @xcite,@xcite ) , represents a significant advance in radio telescope design .",
    "this facility will combine high resolution imaging ( through the use of a 36-element aperture synthesis array with a maximum baseline of @xmath0  km ) with a wide field of view ( achieved with innovative focal plane array technology ) at frequencies between 700 mhz and 1.8 ghz .",
    "installation of the first askap antenna at the murchison radio observatory site , western australia , occured in early 2010 , and the 6-antenna beta test array will operate from september 2011-march 2013 .",
    "it is anticipated that full science operations will be underway by 2014 .",
    "processing and data transport requirements for askap are described in @xcite , and @xcite provides an overview of the data infrastructure requirements .",
    "wallaby @xcite is one of ten askap survey science projects currently in the design study phase .",
    "wallaby aims to significantly enhance our understanding of the extragalactic neutral hydrogen ( hi ) universe .",
    "the survey will cover 75% of the sky , detecting @xmath1 million galaxies to redshift @xmath2 ( lookback time @xmath3 gyr ) .",
    "key science outcomes are studies of galaxy formation and the missing satellite problem in the local group , evolution and star formation in galaxies , mergers and interactions , determination of the hi mass function and its variation with galaxy density , and the nature of the cosmic web .    unlike previous hi surveys",
    ", it will not be feasible to keep all of the raw data ( i.e. fourier visibilities ) from askap observations for subsequent reprocessing . instead",
    ", pipeline - preprocessed spectral data cubes will be provided for analysis .",
    "each wallaby spectral cube is anticipated to comprise 6144 @xmath4 6144 spatial pixels and 16,384 spectral channels ( i.e. @xmath5 gigavoxels or volume elements in total ) , requiring 2.5 terabytes ( tb ) of storage .",
    "a total of 1200 cubes will be required to cover the sky south of declination @xmath6 .",
    "likely additional outputs are integrated ( moment ) maps , continuum images , sub - cubes ( individual objects or scaled versions of larger datasets ) , and full parameterisation of all galaxies , resulting in several petabytes of data products .",
    "such data volumes pose considerable challenges for the existing work practices of astronomers . indeed , visualisation and analysis ( hereafter",
    ", `` v+a '' ) of wallaby data products will require both evolutionary and revolutionary changes to existing software and hardware , with a likely move away from desktop - only solutions , and a greater reliance on remote services .",
    "a brief overview of the wallaby workflow from data collection to catalogue is as follows :    1 .",
    "observe field .",
    "2 .   generate spectral data cube from visibilities .",
    "visualise cube as quality control prior to deletion of raw data .",
    "transfer preprocessed data cube to archive .",
    "perform source finding on data cube .",
    "fit models to candidates and perform related quantitative analysis .",
    ".   add parameterised candidates to catalogue .",
    "apart from personnel , the main resource for completion of all of these stages is access to appropriate computing infrastructure ( hardware and software ) .    as a framework within which to assess the practicalities of achieving each step in the wallaby workflow , we begin ( section ii ) by considering desktop and high performance computing ( hpc ) cluster resources available and used by astronomers today , and project these forward to configurations available by 2014 . in section iii , we present five challenges that v+a of wallaby data products will face in the likely computing environment .",
    "we consider tasks that can be done essentially the same way they are now , and those requiring an investment in new technology or the development of new software , in order to deal with data sets orders of magnitude larger than previous extragalactic hi survey projects .",
    "we make our concluding remarks in section iv .    throughout , we make comparisons with the existing hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ; @xcite ) , conducted with the parkes multibeam receiver @xcite . the southern catalogue , hicat ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ) , comprised 4315 galaxies , and the northern extension , nhicat ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) , a further 1002 sources .",
    "russell jurek ( australia telescope national facility ; atnf ) has combined the 388 individual southern sky data cubes into a single all - sky cube with @xmath9 gigavoxels , and a file size of 12 gb .",
    "the configurations of ( typical ) desktop and hpc resources available to astronomers are fundamental to the capacity of existing or new software to enable each stage of the wallaby workflow . in table",
    "i , we present hardware parameters for today s mid - range desktop computer . using typical growth rates in the computing industry ( e.g. moore s law ; kryder s law @xcite ) , we extrapolate to 2014 ( i.e. `` tomorrow '' ) .",
    "quoted processing speeds are theoretical ( i.e. peak ) , single precision values ; these assume 100@xmath10 efficient algorithms using all available processing cores / streams .",
    "table ii presents similar per - node comparisons for cluster - based hpc configurations .",
    "other hpc configurations are possible , but we restrict our discussion to facilities similar to the swinburne `` green machine '' supercomputer @xcite , with which we are most familiar .",
    "most specifications and capabilities of desktop and hpc compute platforms will simply evolve and grow as they have done over the past decades .",
    "two significant revolutions in compute capability of processors , however , are currently underway ( e.g. @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "central procesing units ( cpus ) are gaining increased compute capacity in the form of multiple cores , rather than increased clock speeds .",
    "2 .   graphics processing units ( gpus ) are boosting compute capacity by around 1050 times by functioning as streaming co - processors , at very low cost .",
    "this `` concurrency '' revolution , based on the availability of high levels of parallelism on a single chip , requires major software work @xcite and a re - examination of algorithms so that scientists can benefit fully from this new processing paradigm ( see @xcite and @xcite for astronomy - related solutions ) .",
    "while cpus are optimised for sequential programs thanks to sophisticated control logic and large memory caches ( to reduce instruction and data access latencies ) , gpus maximise the chip area for computation .",
    "the advent of programming libraries such as cuda and opencl has enabled the use of gpus for general purpose computation , with the gpu acting as a computational co - processor .",
    "typical ( single precision ) theoretical peaks are already over 1 teraflop / s for cards like the nvidia tesla c2050 .",
    "some of the challenges we identify in this paper can only be solved with gpus .",
    ".desktop computing for wallaby [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "perhaps the biggest challenge to planning strategies for visualisation and analysis is that no askap data exists yet .",
    "we do not know what the exact imaging properties of askap will be .",
    "although simulated data cubes are now being generated , until the full askap system undergoes commissioning , we will not fully understand all of the calibration , noise , interference , etc . issues that will arise with the relatively new technology of focal plane arrays .",
    "testing source finders often includes injecting fake sources , with a given signal level , and then seeing how often they are recovered . with real wallaby data cubes unavailable until 2014 , progress in testing source finders will necessarily be limited . while we can do our best to plan source finders based on existing datasets , and early science data from the beta configuration ( september 2011-march 2013 )",
    ", we may find that our techniques do not work adequately for the full dataset . by considering the various v+a tasks now , and identifying approaches based on new hardware and software that were not available or feasible for earlier surveys ,",
    "we can hope to minimise the impact of the `` unknown unknowns '' of askap .",
    "graphics processing units offer an intriguing solution to a number of the current desktop - bound problems .",
    "table iv summarises our thoughts regarding the visualisation and analysis tasks that will require either an evolution of existing software and hardware , or a revolution in how they are approached . by planning today",
    ", we aim to maximise the scientific return from wallaby tomorrow .",
    "the authors would like to thank brbel koribalski ( atnf ) and russell jurek ( atnf ) for discussions relating to the wallaby project , and john taylor ( csiro ) and tim cornwell ( atnf ) for enabling access to the csiro gpu cluster .",
