    "<S> field between the states @xmath54 and @xmath55 is not applied then the following superposition of the metastable states @xmath56 gets completely decoupled from the field when the two - photon resonance condition is satisfied : @xmath57 in eqs . </S>",

    "<S> the superposition @xmath63 is stable , and it is fed by spontaneous emission from the level @xmath64 so that all the atomic population is trapped in @xmath63 after some optical pumping time . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the light ceases to interact with atoms and propagates through the medium without absorption and refraction . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this occurs for any relation between the laser intensities and phases .    at the same time , the preparation of atoms in the superposition of metastable states @xmath54 and @xmath55 means that the coherence @xmath65 is induced . corresponding to the eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ maxw1 ] c , d ) , this should lead to a generation of the field with frequency @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> such an eit - assisted generation of a microwave radiation has recently been observed in atomic cs vapor @xcite . in general , the presence of a third e.m . </S>",
    "<S> field destroys the dark state , so that the optical waves start to interact with the medium . </S>",
    "<S> however , the degree of the destruction is very small if the generated field is weak . in the present case </S>",
    "<S> , the thz generation corresponds to the difference - frequency generation scheme @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we suppose the photon conversion efficiency to be unity , that is for each photon of frequency @xmath67 one thz - photon ( and one photon of frequency @xmath68 ) is generated , then the maximum energy ( or power ) conversion efficiency is given by @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for the @xmath70 system ( @xmath71 @xmath72 ) in @xmath11 mg , we have @xmath73 hz , @xmath74 hz , and @xmath75 . therefore , the thz intensity is always much smaller than the optical one , so that the dark state disturbance is always very small . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the total e.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy dissipation in the medium is negligible , and one can hope to get a very efficient generation in such a nearly dark (  grey  ) medium .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we concentrate on a regime of the radiation propagation in a continuous wave limit , that is , we shall assume that the characteristic time of a change in the field amplitudes and phases , and the interaction time of atoms with the radiation are much longer than the characteristic time of a change in the internal state of an atom . </S>",
    "<S> then , the time derivatives in eqs . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ maxw1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the system considered here is an example of the so - called closed - loop system , where the steady state can be established only when the multi - photon resonance condition is satisfied @xcite : @xmath76 in what follows we will always assume the condition ( [ mp - res ] ) to be fulfilled .    </S>",
    "<S> the density matrix equations for the @xmath0 atom can be found in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these equations can be solved analytically under some simplifying conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that spontaneous relaxation rates for the channels @xmath77 and @xmath78 are equal : @xmath79 @xmath80 . with the condition @xmath81 ( since @xmath82 ) this would also imply @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this simplification allows us to get analytical results which demonstrate all the basic features of the process . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations with real atomic parameters ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2 - 4 ) confirm the analytical results not only qualitatively , but even quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the performance of the proposed scheme is not very sensitive to exact values of the relaxation rates and dipole moments on optical transitions . </S>",
    "<S> another assumption used is quite reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> since the thz radiation intensity is very small , we assume that its rabi frequency is small : @xmath84 @xmath85 .    </S>",
    "<S> solution of the steady - state density matrix equations for @xmath86 , @xmath87 ( @xmath88 is the relaxation rate of the coherence between states @xmath89 and @xmath55 ) , equal spontaneous relaxation rates : @xmath90 , and zero detunings @xmath91 , gives to the first order in @xmath92 :    [ ims ] @xmath93    [ res ] @xmath94 the populations of the metastable states are    @xmath95    where @xmath96 , and the relative phase @xmath97 is determined as @xmath98 the excited state population @xmath99 , which is responsible for irreversible dissipation of the e.m . energy by the medium , is of the second order in @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that atoms are really in the grey state . </S>",
    "<S> one sees from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ims ] ) and ( [ res ] ) , that the medium is absolutely transparent and not refractive for @xmath101 and @xmath102 these are exactly the conditions for the dark state in closed @xmath0 system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for arbitrary optical field amplitudes and phases , however , the refraction and absorption ( or amplification ) of individual frequency components may be substantial . </S>",
    "<S> the change of the fields can be calculated analytically by the method developed in paper by armstrong _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we insert the density matrix elements ( [ ims ] ) and ( [ res ] ) in the maxwell equations ( [ maxw1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude equations are read then :    [ maxw2 ] @xmath103 the intensities associated with each of these waves are given by @xmath104 @xmath105and @xmath106 @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> the set of equations ( [ maxw2 ] ) shows that the total power flow ( proportional to the total intensity @xmath108 ) is conserved , as expected for propagation through a lossless ( due to eit ) medium :    @xmath109 where the last equality follows from the multiphoton resonance condition ( [ mp - res ] ) . obviously , the energy losses ( proportional to the population of the excited state @xmath99 ) appear only in the second order in @xmath110 .    </S>",
    "<S> the set of equations ( [ maxw2 ] ) also implies that @xmath111 which are the well - known manley - rowe relations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these relations tell us that the rate at which photons at frequency @xmath18 are created is equal to the rate at which photons at frequency @xmath68 are created and is equal to the rate at which photons at frequency @xmath68 are destroyed .    in order to solve the maxwell equations , we introduce the following dimensionless variables : field amplitudes @xmath112 where @xmath113 , and a dimensionless optical length @xmath114 with the coefficient @xmath115    as we have discussed above </S>",
    "<S> , the thz intensity is always much smaller than the optical one : @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can safely assume that the total optical intensity @xmath117 is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> this follows also from the first of the manley - rowe relations ( [ m - r ] ) taking into account the relation @xmath118 ( one can infer that an error in making such an approximation is of the order of @xmath119 ) . the conservation of the optical intensity may be written in variables @xmath120 as follows : @xmath121 other  constants of motion  following from the manley - rowe relations ( [ m - r ] ) are : @xmath122 where constants @xmath123 and @xmath124 are determined from the boundary conditions at the @xmath125 .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the assumed above closed values of the optical dipole moments : @xmath126 , one concludes that the quantity @xmath127 is also approximately constant over all the optical path , and it is approximately equal to @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> all this allows one to write the amplitude and the phase maxwell equations in variables @xmath129 as follows :    [ maxw3 ] @xmath130 where we have assumed that the atomic dipole phases @xmath49 do not change along the propagation path . </S>",
    "<S> the optical length can now be re - written as :    @xmath131    the constants ( [ c1 ] ) , ( [ c2 ] ) reduce the problem to solve of the set consisting of the first and the last of eqs . </S>",

    "<S> 4 . while the efficiency is approaching maximum : @xmath207 , for the parameters of fig . 3 where @xmath208 , it drops to @xmath209 for @xmath210 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( a ) . moreover , the intensity oscillations decay quite fast , and at the length @xmath211 ( @xmath212 ) the optical fields are completely absorbed by the medium ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> increase of the input intensity in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( b ) leads to better trapping , weaker e.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy dissipation and , correspondingly , to larger conversion efficiency increasing to @xmath213 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , with increasing input intensity the length scale of the conversion increases as well . </S>",
    "<S> parameters of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( b ) correspond to input intensities @xmath214 and @xmath215 , and to the maximum thz intensity of @xmath216 ( rabi frequency @xmath217 ) generated at @xmath218 ( @xmath219 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , a practical realization of the proposed here generation scheme requires large optical length ( large atom density ) , fairly large input intensities of the optical fields and small decay rate @xmath88 of the atomic coherence @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the rate @xmath88 is determined by uncorrelated laser fluctuations , atomic collisions and other random phase disturbing processes . </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been experimentally demonstrated that , in a buffer gas , the coherence @xmath65 can survive a very large number of atomic collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the rate @xmath220 has been observed in experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation of the fluctuations in @xmath221 and @xmath68 radiations may be achieved if , for example , the @xmath68 frequency is generated from @xmath221 by operation of a raman laser , as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an important point in nonlinear frequency conversion is a phase matching . in our scheme , however , the optical frequencies are quite close in magnitude to each other . therefore , the wave vectors @xmath222 change approximately equally due to dispersion of the medium , induced by the interaction with far - detuned states other than those of the @xmath0 system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this phase mismatch may be neglected . moreover , as it has been shown theoretically and experimentally @xcite , the phase mismatch can be compensated for by very small value of two - photon detuning @xmath223 , if it does appear .    in the particular case of mg atoms , considered here as an illustrative example , the metastable states @xmath224 and @xmath225 are not the ground states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one has to prepare an atomic ensemble in metastable states . </S>",
    "<S> this problem may be solved , for example , through a low - energy high - current electric discharge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another problem is that the state @xmath224 decays spontaneously to the ground state @xmath226 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the rate of this decay , @xmath227 is too slow to produce considerable effect on the process , presented here . </S>",
    "<S> of course , all these problems may be avoided if one uses atoms with the metastable states @xmath54 and @xmath55 being the ground states , like in sm atoms .    in conclusion , we have proposed a scheme for generation of continuous - wave thz radiation . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme is based on a nonlinear interaction of three e.m . </S>",
    "<S> waves in atomic media with a @xmath0 configuration of levels </S>",
    "<S> . an important ingredient of the scheme is a preparation of atoms in the grey state . as a consequence , the e.m . </S>",
    "<S> fields propagate through the medium with very weak dissipation of energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the process may be considered as a parametric difference - frequency generation , where the thz frequency is the difference between two optical ones . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained an analytical solution of the e.m . </S>",
    "<S> propagation problem which demonstrates that the intensities oscillate along the propagation path in a form of jacobi elliptic functions . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to predict that the photon conversion efficiency approaches unity in this technique , and to estimate the optical length at which the energy transfer from the optical field into the thz one is maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solution is confirmed by numerical calculations taking into account doppler broadening and relaxation of the grey state . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations show that the efficiency of the thz generation remains still very high in real situations , if the input optical intensity is sufficiently high to satisfy the condition ( [ i - cond ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note finally that the tuning of obtained thz radiation may be realized by shifting the metastable state energies via strong static magnetic or / and electric fields . </S>"
