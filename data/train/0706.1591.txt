    "when probing small distances inside a hadron with a fixed momentum scale @xmath2 one resolves its constituents quarks and gluons .",
    "as one increases the energy of the scattering process , the parton densities seen by the probe grow . at some energy much bigger than the hard scale",
    ", the gluon density has grown so large that non - linear effects become important .",
    "one enters the saturation regime of qcd , a non - linear yet weakly - coupled regime that describes the hadron as a dense system of weakly interacting partons ( mainly gluons ) .",
    "the transition to the saturation regime is characterized by the so - called saturation momentum @xmath3 this is an intrinsic scale of the high - energy hadron which increases as @xmath4 decreases . @xmath5 but as the energy increases , @xmath6 becomes a hard scale , and the transition to saturation occurs when @xmath6 becomes comparable to @xmath7 although the saturation regime is only reached when @xmath8 observables are sensitive to the saturation scale already during the approach to saturation when @xmath9 this is especially true in the case of hard diffraction in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .    both inclusive ( @xmath10 ) and diffractive ( @xmath11 )",
    "dis are processes in which a photon ( of virtuality @xmath12 ) is used as the hard probe , and at small values of @xmath13 parton saturation becomes relevant .",
    "the dipole picture naturally describes inclusive and diffractive events within the same theoretical framework .",
    "it expresses the scattering of the virtual photon through its fluctuation into a color singlet @xmath14 pair ( or dipole ) of a transverse size @xmath15 .",
    "the dipole is then what probes the target proton , seen as a color glass condensate ( cgc ) : a dense system of gluons that interact coherently .",
    "therefore , despite its perturbative size , the dipole cross - section is comparable to that of a pion .",
    "the same dipole scattering amplitude @xmath16 enters in the formulation of the inclusive and diffractive cross - sections : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the well - known @xmath19 wavefunction . to obtain the right - hand sides",
    ", we have decomposed the dipole - size integration into three domains : @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 and used the dipole amplitude @xmath16 discussed below .",
    "one sees that hard diffractive events ( @xmath23 ) are much more sensitive to saturation than inclusive events , as the contribution of small dipole sizes is suppressed and the dominant size is @xmath24",
    "the good - and - walker picture of diffraction was originally meant to describe soft diffraction .",
    "they express an hadronic projectile @xmath25 in terms of hypothetic eigenstates of the interaction with the target @xmath26 that can only scatter elastically : @xmath27 the total , elastic and diffractive cross - sections are then easily obtained : @xmath28 ^ 2\\hspace{0.5 cm } \\sigma_{diff}=\\sum_n c_n^2 t_n^2\\ .\\label{gaw}\\ ] ]    it turns out that in the high energy limit , there exists a basis of eigenstates of the large@xmath29 qcd @xmath30matrix : sets of quark - antiquark color dipoles @xmath31 characterized by their transverse sizes @xmath32 in the context of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , we also know the coefficients @xmath33 to express the virtual photon in the dipole basis . for instance , the equivalent of @xmath34 for the one - dipole state is the photon wavefunction @xmath35    r0.5        this realization of the good - and - walker picture allows to write down exact ( within the high - energy and large@xmath29 limits ) factorization formulae for the total and diffractive cross - sections in dis . they are expressed in terms of elastic scattering amplitudes of dipoles off the cgc @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total rapidity .",
    "the average @xmath38 is an average over the cgc wavefunction that gives the energy dependence to the cross - sections .",
    "formulae are similar to ( [ gaw ] ) with extra integrations over the dipoles transverse coordinates .",
    "for instance , denoting the minimal rapidity gap @xmath39 the diffractive cross - section reads  @xcite @xmath40 this factorization is represented in fig .",
    "[ ddis ] . besides the @xmath12 dependence",
    ", the probabilities to express the virtual photon in the dipole basis @xmath41 also depend on @xmath42 starting with the initial condition @xmath43 the probabilities can be obtained from the high - energy qcd rapidity evolution .",
    "finally , the scattering amplitude of the n - dipole state @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the scattering amplitude of the one - dipole state .",
    "the rapidity evolution of the correlators @xmath47 should obtained from the cgc non - linear equations ; one can then compute the diffractive cross - section .    when taking @xmath48 in formula , one recovers the formula used for our previous estimates , which corresponds to restricting the diffractive final state to a @xmath14 pair . in practice",
    "the description of hera data also requires a @xmath49 contribution .",
    "within the high - energy and large@xmath29 limits , the scattering amplitudes off the cgc are obtained from the pomeron - loop equation  @xcite derived in the leading logarithmic approximation in qcd .",
    "this is a langevin equation which exhibits the stochastic nature  @xcite of high - energy scattering processes in qcd .",
    "its solution @xmath50 is an event - by - event dipole scattering amplitude function of @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is a scale provided by the initial condition ) .    r0.5        the solution @xmath54 is characterized by a saturation scale @xmath6 which is a random variable whose logarithm is distributed according to a gaussian probability law  @xcite .",
    "the average value is @xmath55 and the variance is @xmath56 the saturation exponent @xmath57 determines the growth of @xmath58 with rapidity , and the dispersion coefficient @xmath59 defines two energy regimes : the geometric scaling regime ( @xmath60 ) and diffusive scaling regime ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "evolving a given initial condition yields a stochastic ensemble of solutions @xmath62 from which one obtains the dipole correlators : @xmath63 where in the right - hand side , @xmath64 is an average over the realizations of @xmath65 indeed , both quantities @xmath66 and @xmath67 obey the same hierarchy of equations .",
    "one obtains the following results for the dipole scattering amplitudes  @xcite : @xmath68 all the scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of @xmath69 the amplitude for a single dipole which features the following scaling behaviors : @xmath70    in the saturation region @xmath71 @xmath72 as the dipole size @xmath73 decreases , @xmath74 decreases towards the weak - scattering regime following the scaling laws ( [ gs ] ) or ( [ ds ] ) , depending on the value of @xmath75 as shown in fig .",
    "[ ploop ] . in the geometric scaling regime ( @xmath60 )",
    ", the dispersion of the events is negligible and the averaged amplitude obeys ( [ gs ] ) . in the diffusive scaling regime ( @xmath61 ) , the dispersion of the events is important , resulting in the behavior ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "when pomeron loops are not included in the evolution , only the geometric scaling regime appears .",
    "in the geometric scaling regime , instead of being a function of the two variables @xmath73 and @xmath76 @xmath77 is a function of the single variable @xmath78 up to inverse dipole sizes significantly larger than the saturation scale @xmath79 this means that in the geometric scaling window in fig .  [ ploop ] , @xmath77 is constant along lines parallel to the saturation line .",
    "physically , they are lines along which the dipole sees a constant partonic density inside the proton .    in dis",
    ", this feature manifests itself via the so - called geometric scaling property . instead of being a function of @xmath12 and @xmath4 separately ,",
    "the total cross - section is only a function of @xmath80 up to large values of @xmath81 similarly , the diffractive cross - section is only a function of @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath84 experimental measurements are compatible with those predictions  @xcite , with the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the average saturation scale @xmath87 this determines the saturation exponent @xmath88 hera probes the geometric scaling regime and one could expect so of future measurements at an electron - ion collider .    the estimates of section",
    "i ( where one should now replace @xmath6 by @xmath58 ) are obtained in the geometric scaling regime : the total cross - section is dominated by semi - hard sizes ( @xmath89 ) while the diffractive cross - section is dominated by dipole sizes of the order of the hardest infrared cutoff in the problem : @xmath90 in the diffusive scaling regime , up to values of @xmath91 much bigger than the average saturation scale @xmath92 things change drastically : both inclusive and diffractive scattering are dominated by small dipole sizes , of order @xmath93 yet saturation plays a crucial role .",
    "cross - sections are dominated by rare events in which the photon hits a black spot that he sees at saturation at the scale @xmath94 in average the scattering is weak ( @xmath95 ) , but saturation is the relevant physics .",
    "our poor knowledge of the coefficient @xmath59 prevents quantitative analysis , still the diffusive scaling regime has striking signatures .",
    "for instance the inclusive and diffractive cross - sections do not feature any pomeron - like ( power - law type ) increase with the energy .",
    "it is likely out of the reach of hera , and future studies in the context of @xmath96 collisions at the lhc are certainly of interest .",
