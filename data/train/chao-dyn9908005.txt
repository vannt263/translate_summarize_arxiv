    "coupled limit cycle oscillators have been extensively studied in recent times as a mathematical model for understanding the collective behavior of a wide variety of physical , chemical and biological problems @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest and earliest of such models is the so called kuramoto model @xcite , which is a mean field model of a collection of phase oscillators , and clearly exhibits such cooperative phenomenon as spontaneous synchronization of the oscillators beyond a certain coupling strength . a more generalized version of the coupled oscillator model that includes both phase and amplitude variations exhibits collective behavior like amplitude death , where , for a large enough spread in the natural frequencies of the oscillators , an increase in the coupling strength induces a stabilization of the origin , leading to a total cessation of oscillations in the system @xcite .",
    "other collective states observed in these models include partial synchronization , phase trapping , large amplitude hopf oscillations and even chaotic behavior @xcite .",
    "recently there has been some interest in investigating the effect of time delay on the collective dynamics of these coupled models @xcite .",
    "time delay is ubiquitous in most physical @xcite , chemical @xcite , biological @xcite , neural @xcite , ecological @xcite , and other natural systems due to finite propagation speeds of signals , finite processing times in synapses , and finite reaction times .",
    "time delayed coupling introduces interesting new features in the collective dynamics , e.g. simultaneous existence of several different synchronized states @xcite , regions of amplitude death even among identical oscillators @xcite , and bistability between synchronized and incoherent states @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable aspects of this cooperative dynamics is that many of its salient features can be observed even in a system consisting of just two coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "the temporal behavior of either of the two oscillators in such a case ( which is easy to investigate both numerically and analytically ) reveals a great deal about the collective aspects of larger systems .",
    "in fact , a useful point of view to adopt is to regard each oscillator as being driven autonomously by a source term that represents the collective feedback of the rest of the system .",
    "motivated by such a qualitative consideration , we have studied in detail the dynamics of the following model system of an autonomously driven single limit cycle oscillator [ eqn : e1 ] ( t ) - ( a + i - z(t ) ^2 ) z(t ) = f(z(t- ) ) , where @xmath0 is a complex quantity , @xmath1 the frequency of oscillation , @xmath2 a real constant , and @xmath3 is the time delay of the autonomous feedback term @xmath4 . in the absence of the feedback term eq .",
    "( [ eqn : e1 ] ) , often called the stuart - landau equation , has a stable limit cycle of amplitude @xmath5 with angular frequency @xmath1 .",
    "it is simply the normal form of a supercritical hopf bifurcation and is a useful nonlinear model for a variety of physical , chemical and biological systems . for the autonomous feedback term",
    "we choose the following model form : [ fbterm : e2 ] f(z(t- ) ) = - k_1 z(t- ) - k_2 z^2(t- ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the strengths of the linear and nonlinear contributions of the feedback .",
    "this choice is motivated by considerations of both mathematical simplicity and possible importance for modeling of physical and biological systems .",
    "the quadratic term is the simplest nonlinearity that can break the rotational symmetry of the stuart - landau system .",
    "physically this term introduces nonlinear mode coupling , a process that is important in large coupled systems .",
    "( [ eqn : e1 ] ) can also be viewed as a prototype equation arising in the delayed feedback control of an individual physical or biological entity that can be modeled by the normal form .",
    "our results may thus be of more general and direct utility in addition to provide useful insights into the collective dynamics of large systems .",
    "similar studies ( using a variety of feedback terms ) exist for the damped harmonic oscillator , e. g. @xcite , but we are not aware of such investigations for our model limit cycle oscillator .",
    "a few investigations in the past have restricted themselves to the study of noise and perturbations @xcite on the dynamics of such an oscillator .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in section [ sec : lin ]",
    ", we analyze the dynamics of the oscillator using just the linear feedback term and discuss the analytic conditions for the stability of the origin and the existence of periodic orbits .",
    "detailed bifurcation diagrams are plotted as a function of the various system parameters like @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 and their similarity to collective states of larger systems is pointed out .",
    "we also present numerical results on higher frequency states , which can coexist with the lowest periodic state and discuss the phenomenon of frequency suppression of these states as a function of the time delay parameter .",
    "section [ sec : nlin ] treats the full feedback term by including the quadratic nonlinear contribution .",
    "the bifurcation diagram is a great deal richer now due to the existence of two other equilibrium points in addition to the origin .",
    "we analyze the stability of these equilibria and the consequent temporal behavior of the oscillator in various parametric regimes .",
    "some novel temporal states are pointed out .",
    "section [ sec : con ] summarizes our results and discusses their significance and possible applications .",
    "we begin our analysis of the model eq .",
    "( [ eqn : e1 ] ) by considering only the linear feedback term ( i.e. @xmath10 ) , so that we have [ eqn : e3 ] ( t ) = ( a + i - z(t ) ^2 ) z(t ) - k z(t- ) , where we have put @xmath11 for simplicity of notation .",
    "note that the above linear feedback term is similar in form to the feedback term used extensively in experimental and theoretical investigations of control of chaos using the pyragas method @xcite .",

    "( [ eqn : e3 ] ) has a time - asymptotic periodic solution given by @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath16 , then the origin is the only stable solution ; i.e. , no oscillatory time - asymptotic solutions are possible . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the oscillator undergoes a supercritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "we now analyze systematically the effect of time delay on the stability of the origin and the periodic solutions .      the origin @xmath18 is a fixed point of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : e3 ] ) . to study its stability",
    "we assume that the perturbations about @xmath19 grow as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a complex number . substituting in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : e3 ] ) and linearizing about @xmath22 , one easily obtains the following characteristic equation : [ eqn : char ] = a i - k e^- , where the @xmath23 sign arises from considering the complex conjugate of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : e3 ] ) .",
    "this ensures that we have the complete set of eigenvalues . for @xmath24 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath25 .",
    "the origin is stable in the region of parametric space where re(@xmath21 ) @xmath26 , which occurs when @xmath27 .",
    "so the critical , or the marginal stability curve is given in this case by @xmath28 .",

    "( [ eqn : char ] ) remains a transcendental equation with a principal term @xmath30 and hence the equation possesses an infinite number of complex solutions .",
    "let these roots be ordered according to the magnitude of the real parts : @xmath31 , where re@xmath32 re@xmath33 .",
    "the problem of finding the stability criterion then reduces to that of finding the conditions on @xmath34 and @xmath9 such that re@xmath35 , for all @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are real . by substituting this in eq . (",
    "[ eqn : char ] ) , we get [ eqn : chara ] & & = a - k  e^-  ( ) , + [ eqn : charb ] & & = + k  e^-  ( )",
    ". we can arrive at the following two equations for @xmath38 and @xmath39 by squaring and adding the above two equations and by dividing the first equation by the second respectively : [ eqn : beta ] & & _ = , + [ eqn : alpha ] & & = a - ( - ) / ( ) , where , in the above and from here after , we consider only one set of curves by choosing @xmath40 .",
    "the other set of curves arising due to @xmath41 is implicit in the above since the eigenvalues always occur in complex conjugate pairs . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : beta ] ) we see that @xmath39 is real only when @xmath42 .",

    "this gives [ eqn : beta0 ] |_= 0 = . by inverting eq .",
    "( [ eqn : chara ] ) , and noting that @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and that @xmath46 can be either positive or negative , we obtain the following two sets of critical curves : [ eqn : tau1 ] _ 1(n ,",

    "thus the critical curves exist only in the region @xmath50 .",
    "since , for @xmath24 , the region of stability of the origin is given by @xmath27 , the corresponding region , for @xmath51 , will be given by the area between @xmath52 and the critical curve closest to the line @xmath24 .",

    "such periodic orbits for a single oscillator have been observed for externally driven systems and basically arise due to the excitation of higher harmonics from the resonant interaction of the external driver with the basic oscillator @xcite .",

    "these orbits have winding number zero around the origin and exist in the regions @xmath222 and @xmath223 bordering those marked @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",

    "another interesting periodic orbit that we find is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp](a ) and can best be described as a _ spiraling orbit _ since the amplitude of the limit cycle ( in the @xmath217 space ) first spirals out and then comes back to its original state . the phase changes have a step like character and often exhibit large jumps .",
    "such orbits exist in a thin region near the radially trapped solutions .",

    "[ fig : br](a ) ) and thus exhibit a _",
    "birhythmic behavior_. in fact , birhythmicity appears to occur also for the spiraling and trapped solutions and is spread out over a large region of the parameter space inside @xmath227 and @xmath228 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bddelay ] .",
    "birhythmicity is a common phenomenon in many biological cell models , and is currently the subject of many studies @xcite .",

    "the initial conditions chosen were @xmath230 , and @xmath231 .",
    "the nonlinear model equation ( [ eqn : e1non ] ) also exhibits regions of temporal chaos and we have investigated this phenomenon in some detail , particularly with regard to routes to chaos .",
    "the route to chaos appears to be a strong function of the parameters @xmath232 and @xmath9 and the type of periodic orbit existing in a particular parameter domain .",
    "there is evidence of several distinct routes to chaos in the present model system .",
    "for example , the _ radially trapped _",
    "solutions appear to follow the period doubling route to chaos as shown in the sequence of plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptb ] .",
    "the phase reversing solutions appear to go to the chaotic state in several different ways .",
    "the limit cycle can make a transition from a simple orbit to a quasi - periodic state .",
    "it can also period double . or a period 1 state can make a transition to a period-3 orbit .",
    "such a transition is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prb ] .",
    "we find a large window of period-3 orbits starting from @xmath233 for the parameters given in fig .",
    "[ fig : prb ] .",
    "the spiraling orbits appear to undergo a single period doubling bifurcation and then a sudden transition to chaos .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spb ] . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptprspbd ] , we display the detailed bifurcation diagrams ( obtained from poincare section plots ) corresponding to these scenarios .",
    "we would like to add a word here about the numerical precautions followed in generating these diagrams . since many of these attractors can coexist in a birhythmic state",
    ", it is necessary to adopt high accuracy and care in tracking any one of them .",
    "likewise one also needs to get beyond some long transients that the system can exhibit for some particular initial conditions . using these precautions , in fig .",
    "[ fig : maxrvstau ] , we have given a detailed bifurcation diagram as a function of the time delay parameter . in this , the maximum amplitude of the oscillator is plotted for @xmath234 at various values of @xmath9 .",
    "the various numbers on the curves stand for the kind of orbit that is found in that region ( a phase portrait of the orbit is also depicted for reference ) .",
    "the initial conditions chosen have been @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of a single hopf bifurcation oscillator ( the stuart - landau equation ) in the presence of an autonomous time delayed feedback .",
    "the feedback term has both a linear component and a simple quadratic nonlinear term . using a combination of analytical methods and numerical analysis , we have investigated the temporal dynamics of this system in various regimes characterized by the natural parameters of the oscillator ( e.g. its frequency @xmath1 , linear growth rate @xmath2 ) , strengths of the feedback components ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and the time delay parameter , @xmath9 .",
    "our principle results are presented in the form of bifurcation diagrams in these parameter spaces .",
    "these reveal a rich variety of temporal behavior including time delay induced stabilization of the origin , multiple frequency states , frequency suppression , phase slips , saddle node bifurcations , and chaotic behavior . in addition , some of the periodic orbits exhibit novel behavior such as birhythmicity , phase reversals , radial trapping , spiraling oscillations in amplitude space .",
    "some of these can be understood by the stability of the fixed points or the loss of single valuedness of amplitude evolution equation .",
    "one of the attractive features of these results is that many of them have been observed in the collective behavior of larger systems such as the kuramoto model or the amplitude versions of the kuramoto model .",
    "this has been one of our major motivations for constructing this model - as a sort of paradigm to obtain and investigate these states in a simple manner .",
    "the feedback terms not only model the collective drive that a single oscillator feels in a larger system , but also incorporate time delay in an autonomous manner .",
    "time delay frees the dimensional constraints of the system ( the system is essentially @xmath237 -dimensional ) and this might be the reason why its temporal dynamics resembles so much that of larger dimensional systems .",
    "our results may therefore be useful for gaining better insights into the behavior of such large systems .",
    "as an example , the large window of @xmath238 orbits of our model appears to have a correspondence to the transition region between the incoherent and chaotic states of coupled limit cycle oscillators .",
    "we have found that the oscillators in the wings of the frequency distribution of a large collection of oscillators in the mean field model begin to acquire the @xmath238 temporal states in that region and play an important role in the transition mechanism @xcite .",
    "a detailed understanding of their dynamical behavior can thus help us in addressing some of the outstanding problems in this area , such as the nature of transition between low dimensional chaos and turbulence .",
    "our model can also find more direct applications in simulation studies for feedback control of individual physical , chemical or biological entities that have the basic nonlinear characteristics of our hopf oscillator , such as in single mode semiconductor lasers , relativistic magnetrons , chemical oscillations , and biological rhythms in single nerve cells .",
    "in fact , the basic stuart - landau equation is mathematically related to the well known van der pol oscillator equation from which it can be derived by a suitable time averaging . our oscillator model with the quadratic nonlinearity",
    "can likewise be derived from a van der pol type equation which in addition has a nonlinear mathieu like term , i.e. , it is an equation of the form +  ( x^2 - 1 ) + ( 1 +   ( t ) )  x = 0 .",
    "such a nonlinear equation can physically represent parametric excitation of relaxation oscillations and can be used to model a number of physical or biological systems .",
    "it may be possible in such simple systems to then seek experimental verification of some of the novel temporal states displayed by our model .",
