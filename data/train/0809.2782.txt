    "@xcite compare the 2.0 - 10.0kev light curves of wr140 and @xmath21 car ( both are systems with high eccentricity and high inclination ) and note that they are very similar .",
    "@xcite explain the light - curve ( 2.010.0kev ) of @xmath21car using a hydrodynamic simulation of colliding winds .",
    "they show that the data are broadly consistent with the x - ray emission being moderately low throughout most of the orbit .",
    "however , a sharp peak occurs near periastron , when a greater fraction of the stellar winds collides , and the higher pre - shock densities and the lower pre - shock velocities result in stronger radiative cooling .",
    "the eclipse occurs immediately after periastron passage when the companion of @xmath21car swings behind the lbv star with its dense wind .",
    "it is hard to see how a similar model can be used to explain the x - ray variability of wr65 .",
    "strong variations in the absorbing column indicate that the orbit of  has high inclination too . considering the light - curve ( fig.[fig : lc ] ) we can rule out that  has a period of a few days : the two data points obtained in april 2003 indicate constant count rates over at least a week .",
    "moreover , two data points in the light - curve separated by two months ( 12/2004 and 02/2005 ) are similar , while there is an increase of emission by nearly 70% in the next two months . therefore ,  has most likely an orbital period of a few years . in this case",
    "the long duration of the minimum is inconsistent with its interpretation as attenuation by the wind of the wc star immediately after periastron passage . quite different from the short - duration rise of column density observed in wr140 and @xmath21 car ,",
    "the column density in  is persistently very high , @xmath42 , sharply decreasing only at the maximum x - ray light .",
    "the temporary variations of column density in  are similar to those measured in the wc8+o binary @xmath20vel @xcite .",
    "its hard x - ray emission increases by a factor of @xmath43 when column density decreases by factor of @xmath44few during the passage of weak - wind inner side of the shock cone across the line of sight @xcite .    in  the soft x - ray emission",
    "is present at all observed epochs .",
    "its variation can be explained by changing emission measure , while the absorption is nearly constant and comparably low . a soft spectral component in the low state",
    "is also observed in @xmath20vel , v444cyg and @xmath21car .",
    "the origin of soft x - rays in these stars is attributed either to individual stellar winds or to a circumstellar nebula .",
    "accordingly , in these objects the absorbing column to the soft component is similar to the interstellar absorbing column .",
    "in contrast , we find for  that @xmath45 , and the em of the soft component changes with the x - ray light - curve .",
    "thus it is unlikely that the intrinsic wind emission of a companion is solely responsible for the soft x - rays from wr65 .",
    "wr65 is a persistent dust maker @xcite .",
    "@xcite notice that binary stars that are persistent dust makers have nearly circular orbits .",
    "we can assume that the same holds for .",
    "there is a growing number of wc9d binary stars that constitute the `` pinwheel '' class of objects @xcite . in these binary systems",
    "the dust is formed in the wind collision region and is distributed along a wide ( compared to the orbital separation ) archimedean spiral .",
    "the peak of dust production occurs at some distance downstream from the colliding wind stagnation point .",
    "so far there is no direct evidence that  is a pinwheel .",
    "however , the topology and structure of circumstellar matter in a pinwheel could help to explain x - ray spectral variability in .",
    "@xcite presented a model for the absorption of x - rays that includes a treatment of dust grains .",
    "their work confirmed that large - grain absorption for soft x - rays ( @xmath46kev ) is reduced due to the self - blanketing of grains .",
    "interestingly , from the point of view of radiative transfer this is identical to the reduction of opacity for the x - rays in clumped stellar winds @xcite .",
    "winds of wc stars are extremely rich in c and o and could have enhanced abundance of mg and ne .",
    "c and o are dominant absorbers for the softer x - rays ( @xmath47kev ) , while mg and ne strongly contribute to the absorption of harder x - rays ( @xmath48kev ) . in the dusty shell around a wc9d star ,",
    "c would be depleted from the gaseous phase and form grains , reducing the opacity for the softer x - rays .",
    "this may help to explain the large differences between the column densities that we determine from soft and hard x - rays .",
    "recently , @xcite presented 3-d hydrodynamical simulations of colliding winds . scaling the results of their simulation to the parameters of ,",
    "soft x - ray emission could originate from a large volume extending above the orbital plane .",
    "this emission would show little variation with orbital phase and suffer comparably mild absorption in the outer regions of the wc star wind , similarly to what is observed in wr65 . on the other hand ,",
    "a high postshock temperature of @xmath49kev is predicted for a confined region near the point where the winds collide head - on .",
    "densities up to @xmath50g@xmath51 can be expected in the dusty spiral arms . assuming the wind opacity for hard x - rays as @xmath52@xmath53g@xmath34 @xcite",
    ", a spiral arm width of @xmath54 cm would explain the observed high absorption .",
    "this width is consistent with the observed width of the dusty spiral arms in wr104 @xcite .",
    "the lowest absorbing column can be expected at the phase when the line of sight crosses only the outer low density part of the spiral arms .",
    "it is possible that the  observations of at high state have caught this orbital phase .    to conclude",
    ", our first brief study of the variable x - ray emission from  indicates that it is a colliding wind system , where the dust and complex geometry of its colliding wind region are pivotal in explaining its x - ray properties . at present ,  is the only known wc9d star where x - ray emission is detected .",
