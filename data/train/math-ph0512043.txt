    "nature has followed mathematical principles of structural organization in the construction of macromolecular configurations .",
    "our proposal in the present work is the modelling of the folded stage of proteins by some combinatorial optimization techniques associated to euclidean full steiner trees @xcite .",
    "this means that henceforth we take the 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 as our metric manifold .",
    "the analysis to be undertaken can be summarized by the trial of obtaining the potential energy minimization of a protein structure through the problem of length minimization of an euclidean steiner tree @xcite .",
    "our fundamental pattern of input points will be given by sets of evenly spaced points along a right circular helix of unit radius .",
    "we have , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the angular coordinate and @xmath3 stands for the pitch of the helix .",
    "we also use the result of steiner points belonging to another helix of the same pitch and smaller radius or @xmath4 where @xmath5    the function @xmath6 above is easily obtained from the requirement of meeting edges at an angle of @xmath7 on each steiner point . to be rigorous ,",
    "we should write ,    @xmath8    where the max above should be understood as a piecewise choice of the maple@xmath9 software .",
    "we now introduce a generalization of the formulae above by thinking on subsequences of input and steiner points , corresponding to non - consecutive points . these subsequences are of the form : @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the number of intervals of skipped points before the present point on each subsequence and @xmath14 is the number of skipped points .",
    "we also have : @xmath15;\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,1\\leq l_s\\leq l_{s max } = \\left[\\frac{n - k-2}{m}\\right]\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\0\\leq j\\leq m-1 , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,1\\leq k \\leq m \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the square brackets stand for the greatest integer value .",
    "the sequences corresponding to eqs.(1.1 ) and ( 1.2 ) are of course included in the scheme above .",
    "they are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . in the general case",
    ", we can define new sequences of @xmath18 and @xmath19 points instead those given by eqs.(1.1 ) and ( 1.2 ) .",
    "we shall have respectively , @xmath20    the present development is independent of a specific coordinate representation of the points .",
    "if we now assume helical point sets whose points are evenly spaced along right circular helices , we get @xmath21 @xmath22    the function @xmath23 is obtained through the same requirement of meeting edges at @xmath7 on each steiner point .",
    "we have , analogously , @xmath24 where @xmath25    in figure ( 1 ) below we show some sequences of input points for @xmath26 .",
    "[ hp ]        from eqs.(2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) and figure ( 1 ) , we can write for the length of the spanning trees @xmath27+(m-1)\\sqrt{\\alpha^2\\omega^2+a_1 + 1}.\\ ] ]    the length of the steiner trees is then @xmath28\\right)\\\\ & + & \\sqrt{m^2\\alpha^2\\omega^2+r_m(\\omega,\\alpha)(a_m+1)}\\,\\,\\,.\\,\\,\\sum_{k=1}^{m}\\left[\\frac{n - k-2}{m}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 2\\sqrt{m^2\\alpha^2\\omega^2+(1-r_m(\\omega,\\alpha))^2+r_m(\\omega,\\alpha)(a_m+1)}\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after using some useful relations like @xmath29=n - m\\ ] ] @xmath30=n - m-2\\ ] ] and taking the limit for @xmath31 , we get @xmath32 @xmath33    by following the prescriptions for writing the steiner ratio , we can write for the steiner ratio function of very large helical point sets with points evenly spaced along right circular helices @xmath34 where the @xmath35 process above should be understood in the sense of a piecewise function formed by the functions corresponding to the values @xmath36",
    "eq.(2.15 ) is our proposal for a steiner ratio function ( srf ) @xcite .",
    "it allows for an analytic formulation of the search of the steiner ratio which is then defined as the minimum of the srf function , eq.(2.15 ) .",
    "actually , there is a further restriction to be imposed on function ( 2.15 ) in order to characterize it as an useful srf function .",
    "this restriction is that we should consider only full steiner trees , i.e. , non - degenerated steiner trees in which there are exactly three edges meeting at each steiner point .",
    "this restriction can be imposed on the spanning trees , by requesting that the angle @xmath37 between consecutive edges formed with the points @xmath38 as vertices should be lesser than @xmath7 .",
    "we have @xmath39    in figure ( 2 ) below we can see the restrictions corresponding to eq.(2.16 ) , for @xmath40 .",
    "the horizontal line is @xmath41 .",
    "[ hp ]    the @xmath42 spanning tree is the only one which corresponds to full steiner trees in a large region of the @xmath2-interval convenient for our work .",
    "the other trees , @xmath43 correspond to forbidden regions in the same @xmath2-interval .",
    "the corresponding steiner trees to be obtained from the positions of the points @xmath44 and @xmath38 are necessarily degenerate and should not be taken into consideration .",
    "thus , the prescription ( 2.15 ) for the srf function turns into @xmath45 where @xmath46    the function ( 2.17 ) has a global minimum in the point @xmath47 and @xmath48    for a proof see @xcite .",
    "the last value corresponds to the famous main conjecture of ref .",
    "@xcite about the value of the steiner ratio in 3-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "it lead us also to think that nature has solved the problem of energy minimization in the organization of intramolecular structure by choosing steiner trees as an intrinsic part of this structure @xcite .",
    "in the following we continue to work in a @xmath49 manifold with an euclidean distance definition .",
    "let us now introduce a tree as that of figure ( 3 )    [ hp ]    there are @xmath18 input points ( position vectors @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 steiner points ( position vectors @xmath52 ) .",
    "if @xmath53 is not an integer number , there is not a tree with these @xmath18 , @xmath54 values @xcite . in figure",
    "( 3 ) with @xmath55 , we assume @xmath18 to be a feasible value .",
    "the knowledge of the steiner problem tell us that this tree structure is not stable since its total length can be reduced by decreasing the number @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the usual stable steiner problem corresponds to @xmath56 . in this section",
    "we shall give another proof of this fact by exploring the concept of a steiner network with physical interaction among its vertices .",
    "the structure depicted at figure ( 3 ) is a representative of the network which models the fundamental interactions inside a biomacromolecule .",
    "let us consider the interaction of this structure with similar structures .",
    "let the resulting interaction forces as applied to input and steiner points be @xmath57 , @xmath58 , respectively and let @xmath59 be the length of an edge between a steiner point and an input point on its neighbourhood .",
    "we have the following identities : @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 stand for the modulus of the parallel components to the edges of the resulting forces @xmath57 , @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the total length of the tree above is @xmath66    from eqs.(2.20 ) , ( 3.1 ) , we can write the total length in the form @xmath67    we now specialize this set of applied forces at the vertices as being collinear with the edges joining them , or @xmath68 is the elastic constant .",
    "the assumption of local equilibrium of these forces lead to the conditions : @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 this is a set of generalized fermat problems or steiner problems @xcite .    for this equilibrium configuration , eq.(3.3 )",
    "turns into @xmath72    the stability of this equilibrium configuration under a variation of the applied forces can be tested by latexmath:[\\[\\delta l=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\mathbf{r}_j\\,\\,\\cdot\\,\\,\\delta\\hat{f}_{j     we take cartesian coordinates for the @xmath49 vectors @xmath74 , @xmath75 and we consider the three independent variations @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 in the coordinates of the steiner points .",
    "the corresponding variations in the length of the tree are of the form @xmath79(x_j - x_{s_k})}{||\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{s}_k||^3}=0\\ ] ] and two other analogous expressions for the variations @xmath77 , @xmath78 .    from the arbitrariness of these variations we can write , @xmath80}{||\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{s}_k||^3}=0\\,.\\ ] ]    we can also write @xmath81    we now write the position vectors @xmath50 , @xmath52 for the configuration depicted at figure ( 3 ) .",
    "the points can be taken as evenly spaced along right circular helices which radii are 1 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "we have , @xmath83 @xmath84    @xmath85 is a function which can be derived from the equilibrium conditions in eqs.(3.7)(3.9 ) . for @xmath56",
    "there is only one solution given by @xmath86    this solution coincides with eq.(1.3 ) .    for @xmath87",
    ", another useful solution could be obtained from the equations : @xmath88    curiously , nature has chosen this solution for @xmath89 to keep sure of partial equilibrium of side chains between the amide plane conformation in proteins @xcite .",
    "for the configuration given by eqs.(3.15)(3.16 ) ,",
    "eq.(3.15 ) can be written as @xmath90 where the geometrical object @xmath91 can be written in the coordinates of eqs.(3.16 ) and ( 3.17 ) as @xmath92 @xmath93r_p^2+\\alpha^2\\omega^2[2r_p(j\\!\\!-\\!\\!1)k\\cos(j\\!\\!-\\!\\!1\\!\\!-\\!\\!k)\\omega\\!\\!-\\!\\!k^2]}{[1+r_p^2\\!\\!-\\!\\!2r_p\\cos(j\\!\\!-\\!\\!1\\!\\!-\\!\\!k)\\omega+\\alpha^2\\omega^2 ( j\\!\\!-\\!\\!1\\!\\!-\\!\\!k)^2]^{3/2}}.\\ ] ] @xmath94    to each @xmath95-value , there will be a term @xmath96 which dominates the sum above . however , we can not have @xmath96 for @xmath87 .",
    "this can be seen from the fact for a vertex @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) there are ( @xmath99 ) nearest external vertices @xmath100 .",
    "the sequence of their consecutive position vectors is @xmath101 and the requirement @xmath96 corresponds to an integer @xmath54-value only for @xmath56 .",
    "this @xmath56 case which is known to correspond to the most stable problem @xcite has as a possible configuration the figure ( 4 ) below    [ hp ]",
    "we have stressed on some past publications that there is a self - consistent treatment of the intramolecular organization of biomacromolecules in terms of steiner networks .",
    "this representation is able at deriving information concerning its stability and evolution .",
    "the supporting facts for stability are now well - established and the ideas related to the evolution of macromolecules are in their way to be developed and accepted as a preliminary theory of molecular evolution .",

    "these are aimed at studying the structures which energy is around the assumed energy of the minimum solution and the variation process of the chiral properties in the neighbourhood of this minimum .",
