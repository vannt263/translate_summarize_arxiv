    "in the search for physics beyond the standard model , the observation of @xmath0 violation could be a very usefull tool .",
    "many models shows @xmath0 nonconservation effects , as , for example , the superweak model @xcite , the kobayashi - maskawa model @xcite , the penguin model @xcite or the weinberg - higgs model @xcite .    today",
    ", there are three systems where @xmath0 violation has been observed .",
    "the first one was the @xmath10 decay , where it was shown @xcite that @xmath11 is not a pure eigenstate of @xmath0 , and then , the parameter @xmath12 is nonzero .",
    "later , direct @xmath0 violation in @xmath13 decays has been observed .",
    "very recently , @xmath0 violation has also been observed in the @xmath14 and other related modes ( for a review , see @xcite ) .    in 1957 , okubo @xcite noted that @xmath0 violation could cause differences in the branching ratios of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays .",
    "pais @xcite extended this proposal also to @xmath17 and @xmath18 decays .",
    "in more recent works the @xmath0 violation signs were also investigated using nonleptonic hyperon decays @xcite-@xcite where @xmath6 decays were stiudied too . in @xcite",
    "the study has been made in the framework of the standard model , and in @xcite , @xcite , new physics was considered . at the experimental level , there are experiments searching for @xmath0 violation in hyperon decays @xcite .",
    "the nonleptonic @xmath19 decays has only been studied in @xcite where the the strong phases were estimated at leading order in heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the @xmath20 strong phases using an effective lagrangian model , without the heavy - baryon approximation , and their effects to the asymmetry parameters in the @xmath21 decays .",
    "the size of the @xmath0 violation depends on the final - state strong interaction between the produced particles .",
    "so , in order to perform the calculations , the strong phase shifts are needed .",
    "at the moment , the situation of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 decays is very confortable , the @xmath24 strong phase shift analysis is very well known experimentally @xcite . at the theoretical level , this system is very well described , and , at least at low energies , the chiral perturbation theory is very precise @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , in the decays that produce hyperons , the situation is not so good , no experimental data is available to the @xmath25 interactions .",
    "in fact , some information can be obtained in the study of hyperonic atoms ( see , for example , @xcite , where the @xmath26 coupling constant is estimated ) , but it is not enough to fully understand the @xmath27 interaction . thus , to investigate the @xmath25 interactions , the only way is to use a model .",
    "as it was said , the chiral perturbation theory is very accurate when applied to the @xmath24 interactions , so , we hope that it works in the @xmath25 system too . in @xcite-@xcite , @xcite",
    "that was done to the @xmath28 decay , and the calculated phases were very small .    in this work , the @xmath29 is studied , and the strong phase shifts for @xmath30 interactions are calculated using the model presented in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "chiral lagrangians are used , describing processes with @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the intermediate states .",
    "the @xmath9-term is also included , but not only as a parametrization ( as it was done in @xcite ) , but relating it with the scalar form factor @xmath31 , based in the results of @xcite , @xcite .",
