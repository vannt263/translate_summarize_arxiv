    "relativistic jets occur in black hole binary star systems ( microquasars ) ( e.g. , mirabel & rodorguez 1999 ) , occur in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ; ferrari 1998 ; meier et al .",
    "2001 ) , can be associated with neutron stars and pulsar wind nebulae , e.g. , crab nebula jet ( weisskopf et al . 2000 ) , and are thought responsible for the gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. , zhang & mszros 2004 ; piran 2005 ; mszros 2006 ) .",
    "it is thought that these jets are powered and collimated hydromagnetically ( e.g. , blandford 2000 ) .",
    "such poynting flux dominated outflows arise on magnetic field lines threading the horizon of a rotating black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; blandford & payne 1982 ) , and form as magnetic flux is pumped by the inflowing gas or generated by dynamo action in a surrounding accretion disk ( e.g. , kudoh & kaburaki 1996 )",
    ". the observed high degree of jet collimation is generally attributed to hoop stress from the toroidal magnetic field acting in concert with an external pressure .",

    "indicate jet production consisting of a poynting - flux high lorentz factor spine with @xmath0 , and a matter dominated sheath with @xmath1 possibly embedded in a lower speed , @xmath2 , disk / coronal wind .",
    "circumstantial evidence such as the requirement for large lorentz factors suggested by the tev bl lacs when contrasted with much slower observed motions ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2005 ) suggests such a spine - sheath morphology , although alternative interpretations are also possible ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 ; stern & poutanen 2008 ; bromberg & levinson 2009 ; giannios et al . 2009 ) .",
    "strongly magnetized relativistic outflows are typically produced from rotating bodies ( neutron stars , black holes and accretion disks ) .",
    "a toroidal magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) is wound up in such outflows and in the far zone becomes dominant because the poloidal field ( @xmath4 ) falls off faster with expansion and distance . in configurations with strong toroidal magnetic field ,",
    "the current - driven ( cd ) kink mode is unstable .",
    "this instability excites large - scale helical motions that can strongly distort or even disrupt the system . for static cylindrical force - free equilibria",
    ", the well - known kruskal - shafranov criterion indicates that the instability develops if the length of the plasma column , @xmath5 , is long enough for the field lines to go around the cylinder at least once ( e.g. , bateman 1978 ) : @xmath6 . for relativistic force - free static configurations ,",
    "the linear instability criteria have been studied by several authors ( istomin & pariev 1994 , 1996 ; begelman 1998 ; lyubarskii 1999 ; tomimatsu et al .",

    ", rotation and shear could significantly affect the instability criterion .",
    "twisted structures are observed in many agn jets on sub - parsec , parsec and kiloparsec scales ( e.g. , gmez et al .",
    "2001 ; lobanov & zensus 2001 ) . non - relativistic and relativistic simulations of magnetized jet formation and/or propagation have showed helical structures attributed to cd kink instability ( e.g. , lery et al .",

    "2008 ; moll 2009 ; mckinney & blandford 2009 ; carey & sovinec 2009 ) . in the absence of cd kink instability and resistive relaxation , helical structures may be attributed to the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) helical instability driven by velocity shear at the boundary between the jet and the surrounding medium ( e.g. , hardee 2004 , 2007 ) or triggered by precession of the jet ejection axis ( begelman et al .",
    "it is still not clear whether current driven , velocity shear driven or jet precession is responsible for the observed structures , or whether these different processes are responsible for the observed twisted structures at different spatial scales .    in a previous paper we performed 3d relativistic mhd simulations and investigated the development of cd kink instability in a static plasma column with a force - free helical magnetic field ( mizuno et al .",
    "we found that the initial configuration was strongly distorted but not disrupted by the kink instability .",
    "although static configurations ( or more generally rigidly moving flows considered in the proper reference frame ) are the simplest ones for studying the basic properties of the kink instability , in a realistic case , rotation and shear motions could significantly affect the cd kink instability . in this paper",
    "we investigate the influence of a velocity shear surface on the stability and nonlinear behavior of relativistic sub - alfvnic flow .",
    "because sub - alfvnic flow is stable to the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability , we can focus on the development of cd kink instability . in this paper",
    "we describe the numerical method and setup used for our simulations in  2 , present our results in  3 , in  4 compare our results to instability expectations and conclude , and in the appendix present multi - dimensional numerical code tests .",
    "in order to study time evolution of the cd kink instability in the relativistic mhd ( rmhd ) regime , we use the 3d grmhd code `` raishin '' in cartesian coordinates .",
    "raishin is based on a @xmath7 formalism of the general relativistic conservation laws of particle number and energy - momentum , maxwell s equations , and ohm s law with no electrical resistance ( ideal mhd condition ) in a curved spacetime ( mizuno et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the raishin code , a conservative , high - resolution shock - capturing scheme is employed .",
    "the numerical fluxes are calculated using the hll approximate riemann solver , and flux - interpolated constrained transport ( flux - ct ) is used to maintain a divergence - free magnetic field .",
    "the raishin code performs special relativistic calculations in minkowski spacetime by choosing the appropriate metric .",
    "the raishin code has proven to be accurate to second order and has passed a number of numerical tests including highly relativistic cases and highly magnetized cases in both special and general relativity ( mizuno et al .",
    "the results of multidimensional numerical test problems are shown in the appendix .",
    "the multidimensional numerical test problems show that the mc slope - limiter scheme performs best on most of the tests and we have used this scheme for reconstruction .    in our simulations",
    "we choose a force - free helical magnetic field for the initial configuration ( mizuno et al .",
    "a force - free configuration is a reasonable choice for the strong magnetic field cases that we study here . in general , the force - free equilibrium of a static cylinder is described by the equation @xmath8 in particular we choose the following form for poloidal ( @xmath9 ) and toroidal ( @xmath3 ) components of magnetic field determined in the laboratory frame @xmath10^{\\alpha}}~,\\ ] ] @xmath11^{\\alpha } } \\sqrt { { [ 1 + ( r / a)^{2}]^{2 \\alpha } -1 - 2 \\alpha ( r / a)^2 \\over 2 \\alpha -1}}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the radial position in cylindrical coordinates normalized by a simulation scale unit @xmath13 , @xmath14 parameterizes the magnetic field amplitude , @xmath15 is the characteristic radius of the column , and @xmath16 is the pitch profile parameter .",
    "the pitch parameter , @xmath17 , determines the radial profile of the magnetic pitch , and larger @xmath18 indicates increasing helical pitch of the magnetic field lines . with our choice for the force - free field",

    "this definition for the pitch parameter and the force - free helical field has been chosen to be the same as that used in previous non - relativistic work ( appl et al .",
    "2000 ; baty 2005 ) and in our previous relativistic work ( mizuno et al .",
    "2009a ) for purposes of comparison .",
    "for our modestly relativistic sub - alfvnic flow speeds , the jet density and magnetic fields within the jet when determined in the jet flow frame are reduced slightly relative to their values in the laboratory frame by the flow lorentz factor ( e.g. , anile 1989 ; komissarov 1999 ) .",

    "however , for the largest velocity shear radius , @xmath64 , the difference relative to the static plasma column in the linear and early non - linear phase is reduced , and the growth rate of the cd kink instability is faster and with lower maximum @xmath79 than for the cases with velocity shear radius @xmath98 and @xmath74 .",

    "3 , were the most similar to a static plasma column for smallest and largest shear radius .",
    "the principal difference between the smallest and largest velocity shear radius cases lies in the flow morphology relative to the kink morphology indicated by the density isosurface .    in figure 5",
    "we follow the time evolution of the @xmath101 and @xmath102position of the maximum density in the @xmath103 plane at @xmath104 .",

    "the e - folding times can be found in table 2 in  4 . in this case , the e - folding time is increased relative to the static plasma column by about the same amount only for velocity shear radii @xmath127 . however , the decreasing helical pitch results in more rapid growth in the linear phase , and makes a transition to the nonlinear phase in about 60% of the time for the constant pitch cases shown in figure 3 .",
    "this more rapid growth is similar to results for a static plasma column ( mizuno et al .",
    "thus , the growth rate trends found for the static plasma column are maintained in the presence of sub - alfvnic flow .",
    "the maximum amplitude of @xmath79 is comparable to that found for constant helical pitch .",
    "however , the amplitude of @xmath79 declines less in the non - linear phase relative to the static case than was found for the constant pitch cases .",

    "on the other hand , this also means that temporal kink growth is significantly slowed even for a velocity shear surface at four times the characteristic radius .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fluid inertia increases by @xmath182 and if the growth time is also increased by the fluid inertia then the e - folding times in the lab frame should be increased by @xmath183 = 1.16 and 1.31 relative to the static case , and this increase comes much closer to the observed increase .",
    "we speculate that the large increase in e - folding times measured in the lab frame is partly a result of the increased inertia of the relativistically moving fluid .",
    "the characteristic time for the instability to affect strongly the initial structure varies from @xmath184 for the decreasing pitch case to @xmath185 for the constant pitch cases . for the constant pitch cases the characteristic time is roughly @xmath186 , with values for @xmath187 being dependent on the structure of the undisturbed state . in a jet context",
    "our perturbations remain static or can propagate with the flow frame depending on the location of the velocity shear surface . in order to check whether the instability would affect a jet flow",

    "the 3d relativistic jet generation simulation performed by mckinney & blandford ( 2009 ) indicates relatively rapid , less than 100 gravitational radii , but non - disruptive kink development over 500 gravitational radii .",
    "our previous and present simulations for static and moving kinks suggest that the rapid but non - disruptive kink development in the jet generation simulation could be a result of a velocity shear surface located less or on order of the characteristic magnetic radius and a density increasing with radius .",
