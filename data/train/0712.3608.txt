    "the correlation between solar acoustic mode frequencies and the magnetic activity cycle is well established and has been substantially studied during the last and current solar cycles ( see for example * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the general frequency shift behavior suggests that the perturbation by the solar cycle on the acoustic frequencies occurs very close to the solar surface .",
    "the physical mechanism , however , is still a matter of debate , namely whether frequencies are changed directly by the magnetic field or indirectly through an associated change in the solar structure ( like a pressure change )",
    ". a detailed analysis of the frequency shift characteristics will hopefully help understand its physical origin .",
    "we present here a new analysis of high degree mode frequency shifts over most of solar cycle 23 , using a global helioseismology technique .",
    "high - degree modes are best suited for studying the frequency shift correlation with the solar cycle since the causing mechanism is believed to be localized near the surface and high - degree modes are also confined to a region near the surface . as a result",
    "the frequency shifts for high degree modes are up to an order of magnitude larger than for medium degree modes .",
    "in the traditional global helioseismology data analysis methodology , a time series of full - disk doppler solar images is decomposed into spherical harmonic coefficients , characterized by its degree ( @xmath1 ) and its azimuthal order ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "each coefficient time series is fourier transformed , and the order of the radial wavefunction ( @xmath3 ) gets separated in the frequency domain . however , a spherical harmonic decomposition is not orthonormal over less than the full sphere _i.e .",
    "_ , the solar surface that can be observed from a single view point resulting in what is referred as spatial leakage . at low and intermediate degrees ,",
    "these leaks are separated in the frequency domain from the target mode and individual modes can be identified and fitted . however , at high degrees , the spatial leaks lie closer in frequency ( due to a smaller mode separation ) and , at high frequency , they become wider ( as the mode lifetimes get smaller ) , resulting in the overlap of the target mode with the spatial leaks that merges individual peaks into ridges . the characteristics of the resulting ridge ( central frequency , amplitude , etc  ) do not correspond to those of the underlying target mode .",
    "this has so far hindered the estimation of unbiased mode parameters at high degrees .",
    "our methodology to recover the mode characteristics consists in generating and fitting a sophisticated model of the underlying modes that contribute to the ridge power distribution and deduce the offset between the ridge properties and the underlying target mode @xcite . to do this",
    "we need a very good model of the relative amplitude of all the modes that contribute to the ridge , _",
    "i.e. _  the leakage matrix , which in turn requires a very good knowledge of the instrumental properties .",
    "the instrumental characteristics must therefore be very well understood and very precisely measured ( see * ? ? ?",
    "although , the highly successful mdi instrument is responsible for great progresses in our understanding of the sun , there remain some instrumental effects that there are not well characterized and/or not taken into account in the data analysis @xcite .",
    "we have incorporated most of the known instrumental effects important to the high - degree analysis in our most recent spatial decomposition , introducing one effect at a time to estimate the resulting correction on mode parameters @xcite .",
    "the following known instrumental effects were taken into account in this latest spherical harmonic decomposition , whose results are presented here : ( 1 ) the correct instantaneous image scale , ( 2 ) the radial image distortion , ( 3 ) the effect of a tilt of the ccd with respect to the optical axis , ( 4 ) the effective @xmath4 angle and ( 5 ) a correction to the carrington elements .    since we are focusing our attention in this paper on changes of mode parameters with epoch ,",
    "we are primarily concerned with instrumental effects that change over time .",
    "although the mdi instrument has been very stable over the years , continuous exposure to solar radiation has increased the instrument front window absorption resulting in a continuous small increase of the instrument best focus .",
    "moreover the change of the front window temperature due to the satellite orbit around the sun also adds a small annual variation .",
    "the instrument has however an adjustable focus with 9 possible positions chosen to best suit the science team needs , resulting unfortunately in abrupt jumps every time that it is changed .",
    "these changes are responsible for the largest variations .",
    "the best focus is periodically and empirically determined from intensity images taken with different focus positions @xcite .",
    "the change in the image scale resulting from a change in focus was shown to be an important effect @xcite and it is taken care in the analysis presented here . however , the effect of the amount of defocus was not taken into account .",
    "a preliminary analysis indicated that it has a small effect on the frequencies @xcite ; we have further studied its influence on the ridge frequency .",
    "full - disk dopplergrams , acquired by the mdi instrument while operating in its @xmath5 resolution mode , were used for this analysis .",
    "the mdi instrument is operated in this mode , known as the _ dynamics program _ , every year for two to three months , when the required telemetry bandwidth is available .",
    "the spherical harmonic decomposition of these dopplergrams was computed for every tenth @xmath1 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the resulting time series fourier transformed in shorter segments ( as described in * ? ? ?",
    "* namely 4096 minutes or 2.8 days long ) whose power spectra were averaged to produce an averaged power spectrum with a low but adequate frequency resolution to fit the ridge while reducing the realization noise .",
    "table  [ table1 ] lists the properties of each epoch included in this study .",
    "the peaks in each ( @xmath8 ) spectra were then fitted with asymmetric lorentzian profiles and the @xmath9 frequencies for each ( @xmath3 , @xmath1 ) multiplet expanded in terms of clebsch - gordan coefficients up to @xmath10 ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "we also compare our results ( hereafter referred to as the high-@xmath1 set ) to results obtained by one of us using the mdi _",
    "structure program_. in this mode the original dopplergrams are convolved , on board the mdi instrument , with a gaussian and subsampled on a @xmath11 grid , thus reducing the telemetry requirements but also limiting the spatial resolution to modes with degree @xmath12 .",
    "the data sets consist of 72-day - long time series that partially overlap with the _ dynamics _ periods ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the central frequencies and the splitting coefficients were determined directly from fit to symmetric lorentzians @xcite . although the instrumental effects listed in section  2 were not taken into account here , their effects are much smaller because the spatial leaks are well separated from the target mode @xcite .",
    "the coverage of both analyses is illustrate in an @xmath13 diagram in fig  [ lnu ] .",
    "note that there is a small overlap in the coverage of both methods .",
    "indeed , by degrading the frequency resolution one can merge resolved modes into a smooth ridge and apply the ridge fitting methodology developed for high degrees to intermediate degrees .",
    "the mdi data analyzed here , see table  [ table1 ] , covers much of solar cycle 23 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ solaract ] .",
    "the average solar uv spectral irradiance ( given by the noaa mg ii core - to - wing ratio ) relative to the 30-day running mean maximum of solar cycle 23 ( reached in january 2002 ) for each epoch is listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "that table also lists the average defocus of the mdi images during each _ dynamics _ epoch , in units of mdi focus steps . early on ( 1996 to 1998 )",
    "the instrument was set to a large defocus ( up to 2.5 focus steps ) , while later on the instrument was set to be nearly on focus ( _ i.e. _ , a defocus of 0.5 focus steps in average ) .",
    "figure  [ freq - ml ] shows mode frequency differences between 2002 and 2005 , namely between high and moderate activity epochs respectively , resulting from medium and high degree determinations .",
    "the frequency shifts for each order , @xmath3 , scale as a power law with the quantity @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 , a good proxy of the mode inner turning point ) , and can be described in a first approximation by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mode inertia ( as first noticed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the observational periods where the mdi instrument was set to a large defocus ( 1996 to 1998 ) , our measured frequency shifts for high-@xmath1 do not agree with results from medium-@xmath1 .",
    "the defocus has a substantial effect on the ridge central frequencies , contrary to our initial expectations .",
    "the resulting instrumental point spread function ( psf ) is affected and the effect of a varying psf has not yet been incorporated in our analysis , therefore we will not include these epochs in our analysis of changes of mode parameters with the solar cycle .",
    "figure  [ corr - freq ] shows the correlation between the frequency shift and the solar activity index variation ( given by the solar uv irradiance ) for four modes with frequency around 3 mhz at high degree ( @xmath18 & @xmath19 ) for the 1999 to 2004 epochs with respect to the 2005 epoch .",
    "we have fitted , using a weighted least - squares minimization , the frequency shift to the solar index variation , assuming a linear relationship with a zero intercept ( solid line ) .",
    "this fit was performed for each ( @xmath3 , @xmath1 ) mode of the medium and high-@xmath1 sets separately , resulting in a total of 1468 and 423 regression fits respectively .",
    "we also computed correlations between the frequency shift and the magnetic plage strength index ( mt .  wilson observatory ) , the solar radio 10.7 cm flux ( national research council of canada ) and the sunspot number ( sidc , rwc belgium ) using the high-@xmath1 set .",
    "the magnetic index gives similar pearson correlation coefficients as the uv flux while the radio flux coefficients are slightly smaller ( by a few percent ) .",
    "the sunspot number correlation coefficients are also similar to those for the uv flux but only for frequencies around 3 mhz , their correlation coefficients increase as the frequency decreases , by some 20% .",
    "the frequency shift between solar maximum and minimum can be estimated by multiplying the slope of the linear fit ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ corr - freq ] ) by the corresponding solar index variation .",
    "we used the 30-day running mean values to estimate the minimum and maximum , reached in march 1996 and january 2002 respectively .",
    "we rejected modes whose pearson correlation coefficient is smaller than 0.8 , or whose slope uncertainty is larger than @xmath20 and only fitted modes for which we have estimates for at least five of the six epochs .",
    "this estimated minimum - to - maximum frequency shift , @xmath21 , incorporates information from all the data sets ( 1999 to 2005 ) in a consistent way , decreasing ipso facto the uncertainties .",
    "the frequency shift increases sharply with frequency and degree .",
    "although several authors multiply the frequency shift by the mode inertia to remove its @xmath1 dependence , we found , as others have at lower and medium-@xmath1 @xcite , that the mode inertia normalized by the inertia of a radial mode of the same frequency gives a better agreement between the medium and high-@xmath1 set shifts , as shown in fig .",

    "as mentioned before , the frequency shifts for 1996 to 1998 are biased due to the change in the amount of defocus . to estimate the resulting bias , we computed the correlation versus the solar activity index and estimated the minimum - to - maximum frequency shift , @xmath21 , as described in the previous section , but using only these three epochs .",
