    "feedback effects from high - mass stars such as intense ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation , strong stellar winds , and supernova explosions at the ends of their lives provide significant effects on the evolution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and star formation in galaxies . understanding the formation of high - mass stars is therefore one of the most pressing issues in the contemporary astronomy . despite numerous theoretical and observational studies attempting to address this issue in the last few decades ,",
    "the detailed physical processes involved are still elusive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for instance the gas mass accretion rate is one of the known difficulties ; high - mass stars must be formed within a short time to overcome the feedback effects of the forming stars , requiring huge mass accretion rates of 10@xmath510@xmath6@xmath7yr@xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recent attempts to investigate the mechanism of the high - mass star formation in the super star clusters ( sscs ) westerlund2 and ngc3603 have provided an important clue to understand the high - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "sscs have remarkably concentrated stars with total mass of @xmath8@xmath7 within a small volume less than 1pc@xmath9 , and their origin was not clarified .",
    "the authors identified a pair of two giant molecular clouds with @xmath10@xmath7 associated with each ssc , where the two clouds has a large velocity separation of 1020kms@xmath1 .",
    "the large velocity separations can not be explained by expanding motion of the gas driven by stellar winds or supernovae .",
    "they suggested that a collision between the two clouds followed by strong shock compression of the molecular gas led to the formation of the massive clusters in a short time less than 1myr .",
    "in addition , a molecular line study in the galactic hii region trifid nebula ( m20 ) , which is dominated by a single o star has shown that m20 is a mimic of westerlnd2 and ngc3603 , where a collision between two molecular clouds with masses of 10@xmath11@xmath7 triggered the formation of the o star @xcite . here again , the velocity separation of the two clouds ( @xmath47kms@xmath1 ) is much larger than the permitted gravitational binding velocity of the two clouds .",
    "these three cases , westerlund2 , ngc3603 , and m20 , indicate that , although more samples and quantitative studies are necessary , cloud - cloud collision has a possibility to be one of the important modes of high - mass star formation for a wide mass range , from a single ob star to sscs .",
    "rcw120 is a galactic hii region @xcite located at a distance of 1.3kpc from the sun , having one single exciting o8v or o9v star known as lss3959 or cd@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it shows a beautiful ring - like structure in the mid - infrared and sub - mm wavelengths which encloses the hii region .",
    "figure [ rgb ] shows a composite color image of rcw120 .",
    "the ring component is clearly traced in the _",
    "spitzer_/glimpse 8@xmath13 m emission ( green , * ? ? ?",
    "spitzer_/mipsgal 24@xmath13 m emission ( blue , * ? ? ?",

    "far infrared emission at 250@xmath13 m by _ herschel_/spire ( red , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also has a ring - like structure , while it is distributed in the slightly outer part of the 8@xmath13 m ring .",
    "the age of the exciting star in rcw120 was investigated by @xcite , and the authors discussed that , due to the large uncertainty on the effective temperature and the relative low luminosity of the star , any age less than 5myr is possible .",
    "rcw120 is cataloged as the spitzer bubble s7 by @xcite .",
    "they identified about 600 ring - like 8@xmath13 m structures within @xmath14 in the galactic longitude , and the work was followed by an expanded catalog of 5106 bubbles published by @xcite , and many of the bubbles include hii regions @xcite .",
    "the pressure - driven expanding hii region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is usually discussed to explain the formation of the spitzer bubbles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the expanding ionization front preceded by the shock front driven by the hii region accumulates neutral material between the two fronts , leading formation of a dense layer .",
    "one can observe this dense layer as an expanding spherical shell on the sky .",
    "the dense layer is fragmented into gravitationally unstable condensations , and the condensations are expected to form stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite observed millimeter dust continuum emission in rcw120 and found that rcw120 is surrounded by dense dust condensations which trace the southern half of the 8@xmath13 m ring .",
    "the condensations were then re - identified with the observations at 870@xmath13 m by @xcite ( see small crosses in figure[rgb ] ) .",
    "they estimated the total mass of the ring structure to be about 2000@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite also carried out a careful analysis of infrared point sources using the _ 2mass _ and _ spitzer _ datasets to identify the young stellar objects ( ysos ) in rcw120 ( see figure[rgb ] ) .",
    "in addition , with the _ herschel _ observations , @xcite discovered one young massive object identified as class 0 in the most massive condensation ( condensation 1core ) located at the south - west of the ring , the stellar mass estimated for the class 0 object is 810@xmath7 .",
    "condensation 1 also harbors a chain of several class i and class i - class ii ysos , which are aligned parallel to the ionization front @xcite .",
    "these observational signatures indicate that rcw120 is a site of on - going star formation .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discussed the triggered star formation in the ring of the dense neutral medium accumulated by the pressure driven hii region .",
    "they suggested that several different star formation mechanisms are simultaneously working in the ring , e.g. , gravitational instabilities , dynamical instabilities , and interaction of the hii region with the pre - existing molecular condensations .",
    "in addition , they discussed that the surrounding ring of rcw120 is porous , and the ysos located distant from the ionization front ( e.g. , those around the condensation 5 region ) could have been formed via interaction with the ionized gas leaking through the ring .    despite of the detailed studies on the second generation star formation in rcw120 in terms of the triggered star formation , the origin of the exciting o star inside the 8@xmath13 m ring has never been focused on . in this paper , we present new molecular observations in co @xmath0=10 and @xmath0=32 toward rcw120 performed with the nanten2 , mopra , and aste telescopes .",
    "mopra and aste provide detailed molecular distributions at high angular resolutions , while nanten2 is used to describe a large - scale gas distribution , allowing us to have the comprehensive understanding of the origin of rcw120 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows ; section 2 summarizes the observations and section 3 the results .",
    "the discussion is given in section 4 , in which two ideas are tested to understand the observational signatures , i.e. , evolution of the hii region and cloud - cloud collision .",
    "section 5 gives a summary .",
    "the nanten2 4-m mm / sub - mm telescope in atacama , chile ( 4,850 m ) was used to image @xmath15 of rcw120 in the @xmath16co and @xmath17co @xmath0=10 emission by using the on - the - fly ( otf ) mode during from 2012 may to 2012 december .",

    "for the case i , as clearly seen in figures[nasco_lv ] and [ mopra_lvall](a ) , both of the red cloud and the blue cloud have uniform velocity distributions well beyond the extent of rcw120 , and furthermore , the velocity separation of @xmath420kms@xmath1 is much larger than the expected velocity separation of 4kms@xmath1 in the c&c scenario . to discuss the case ii , @xmath17co and c@xmath25o velocity distributions of the red cloud is shown in figure [ mopra_lvall](b ) .",

    "here is a brief summary of the above discussion . in the previous studies , interpretations of rcw120 based on the evolution of an hii region are basically successful in reproduction of the morphology and mass of rcw120 .",
    "however , the velocity distribution revealed in the present observations shows no expanding motion contrary to what the model predicts .",
    "we here postulate an alternative idea that an accidental collision between the red cloud and the blue cloud triggered the formation of the o star and the surrounding ring component in rcw120 .",
    "the idea provides an explanation for the coexistence of the two clouds having a large velocity separation as well as the other issues laid on this object .",

    "such collisions are expected to be frequent in gas - rich galaxies as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .      in order to understand the present observations in rcw120",
    ", we first discuss the basic idea of the ccc scenario presented by @xcite , in which collisions between two molecular clouds having different sizes were investigated . because the authors did not include star formation and subsequent uv radiation , in the schematic shown in figure [ ccc_model ] some relevant events are qualitatively added .",
    "first , a small cloud and a large cloud are approaching each other ( stage 0 ) .",
    "once a collision occurs , a dense layer is formed by compression at the interface of the two clouds , creating a cavity in the large cloud ( stage 1 ) .",
    "the diameter of the cavity is nearly equal to that of the small cloud .",
    "the compressed layer is highly turbulent , which can be observed as an intermediate velocity structure @xcite , and the small cloud streams into the compressed layer during the collision .",
    "along with the cavity creation , massive clump formation and subsequent high - mass star(s ) formation occur in the compressed layer , followed by the strong uv radiation from the high - mass star(s ) which ionizes the surrounding neutral material ( stage 2 ) . at the final stage ( stage 3 ) ,",
    "the ionized gas fills up the cavity and erodes the inner surface of the cavity which includes the compressed layer , enhancing the pah emission observable at 8@xmath13 m .",
    "stage 3 may have variations depending on the velocity of the compressed layer .",
    "for example , if deceleration is fast , cavity creation almost stops and much molecular gas remains forward of the moving direction ( stage 3a ) . on the other hand , if the velocity keeps fast , the dense layer completely penetrates the large cloud , forming a tunnel instead of a cavity ( stage 3b ) . in either case",
    ", if the ionized gas completely escapes , only the cavity or the tunnel is observable .",
    "the depth of the cavity and the location of the o star in the cavity are determined by density of the clouds and physical lengths of the small cloud along the colliding direction .",
    "a detailed analysis of the cavity creation and its effects on the star formation will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( torii et al .",
    "2015b , in prep . ) .",
    "the resultant cavity / tunnel should be observed as a projection on the sky .",
    "this is just like looking at a `` wine glass '' ( stage 3a ) or a `` tube '' ( stage 3b ) from various angles .",
    "if observing from the bottom or the top of the glass / tube , one can see a ring shape , and if from the sides , one may see a u - shape or two separated components as shown in figure[ccc_model ] as 3a and 3b , respectively .    it should be noted that , in the habe & ohta model it is assumed that two molecular clouds with different sizes collide . on the other hand , in m20",
    "the observed colliding clouds have almost the same sizes @xcite , and in such a case creation of the cavity is not expected .",
    "it is likely to be more frequent that collisions take place between clouds with different sizes , and the case in m20 is thus relatively rare .",
    "we here discuss an application of the basic ccc scenario to the observed rcw120 , where the blue cloud corresponds to the small cloud in figure[ccc_model ] , and the red cloud to the large cloud .",
    "figure [ ccc_model2 ] shows an interpretation of the ccc in rcw120 , where the x- and y - axes are respectively taken from the @xmath140@xmath141 line and the 0@xmath121180@xmath121 line defined in figure[radial_plot](a ) , and the z - axis is along the line - of - sight .",
    "the origin of the new coordinate system is taken at the exciting o star .",
    "as shown in figure[nasco](b ) , the blue cloud has a v - shape structure , each side of which contains one single co peak at its southern part .",
    "we assume that there was the third peak with a similar size at the south of the present blue cloud and it collided with the red cloud , forming the cavity observed as a ring shape in rcw120 .",
    "the viewing angle of the collision is assumed to be 45@xmath121 toward the north from the line - of - sight (= z - axis ) . the colliding velocity is then calculated to be @xmath430kms@xmath1 , and the depth of the cavity is estimated to be roughly 5pc with the observed size of the 8@xmath13 m ring , @xmath43.5pc . o star will be formed in the compressed interface layer when sufficient mass is accreted in the high - mass dense cores which are simulated by @xcite .",
    "the interface layer between the two clouds will move at a velocity somewhat less than 30kms@xmath1 due to the deceleration depending on the density ratio between the two clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we tentatively assume that the decelerated velocity is 15kms@xmath1 , the o star will move at the same velocity in the same direction with the small cloud .",
    "the observed position of the o star with an offset from the center of the ring to the southwest on the symmetry axis of the cavity is then a natural consequence of the triggering under the cloud motion to the southwest .    after forming the o star in the shocked layer , the uv feedback immediately ionized the surrounding neutral material and prohibited formation of other stars via ionization of the neutral gas , followed by the rapid evolution of the hii region .",
    "the hii region finally filled out the cavity as observed , indicating that the ccc in rcw120 is currently in stage 3 ( figure[ccc_model ] ) .",
    "because much gas still remains toward inside the 8@xmath13 m ring , the case 3a is here preferable rather than the case 3b . in figure[slice ] , the co integrated intensity distributions of the red cloud along the x- and y - axes are presented .",
    "the plots show significant co detection inside the 8@xmath13 m ring both in @xmath16co and @xmath17co , although it is strongly reduced to be 4080% in @xmath16co and to be 2550% in @xmath17co from the ring component .",
    "in addition , as discussed in section 3.2 , the o star is likely on the far side of the red cloud , which offers another support for the case 3a .    differently from the basic model in figure[ccc_model ] , in which at stage 3 the ionized gas seems to easily stream out through the opening of the cavity , the opening of the cavity in rcw120 looks being blocked by the bottom of the blue cloud ( figure[ccc_model2 ] ) .",
    "the column density of the blue cloud is by one order of magnitude smaller than the red cloud , making it easier for the ionized gas to stream out through it .",
    "the h@xmath76 and radio continuum images in figure[comp ] , however , do not show a sign of such streams .",
    "although diffuse h@xmath76 emission is seen outside the 8@xmath13 m ring @xcite , it is very weak and is extended only by @xmath411.5pc from the 8@xmath13 m ring even around the opening , not showing evidence for the strong ionized stream .",
    "it is thus suggested that we are observing the beginning of such event , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the beautiful symmetric ring structure also supports the discussion ; as presented in the numerical calculations in @xcite , the neutral medium in a mature hii region may show an asymmetric shape depending on its initial density distribution , suggesting that rcw120 is in its early evolutional phase .",
    "the plots in figure[slice ] are also used to estimate the mass of the molecular gas accumulated by the collision to form the cavity . by measuring the intensity gap between inside and outside the molecular ring in @xmath16co ,",
    "the accumulated molecular mass is roughly estimated to be 10003000@xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , the accumulated layer could have included the mass of the partner cloud of the collision . by assuming the h@xmath64 column density same as the blue cloud , @xmath142@xmath60",
    ", it can be estimated as @xmath41000@xmath7 with the radius of the 8@xmath13 m ring of 1.7pc , the total mass of the accumulated layer is estimated to be @xmath420004000@xmath7 .",
    "this estimate is equivalent to @xmath14395% of the mass of the ring component , @xmath103@xmath7 ( see section 3.5 ) , whereas the mass of the ionized gas is estimated as @xmath109@xmath7 in section 3.5 , which only accounts for less than 10% of the estimated mass of the compressed layer .",
    "these estimates suggest that ionization by the o star for the compressed layer created by the ccc is minor in mass , and that the remaining huge mass is now observable as the dense molecular ring surrounding the hii region .",
    "this is consistent with our argument in the previous paragraph that the o star and the hii region in rcw120 are young , and suggests that the inner structures of the dense ring component were formed before the onset of the interaction with the hii region .    by comparing the cavity depth 5pc and the initial collision velocity of 30kms@xmath1 ,",
    "the lower limit of the timescale of the cavity creation and the subsequent o star formation in rcw120 can be estimated to be as short as @xmath40.2myr , which is still consistent with the observational limit for the exciting o star in rcw120 , as discussed by @xcite that any age less than 5myr is possible .",
    "this timescale may be larger like 0.4myr if we adopt 15kms@xmath1 as the average relative velocity because the colliding velocity was probably decelerated during the collision as discussed above .",
    "we will investigate the relationship between the cavity depth and colliding velocity into more detail in the forthcoming paper ( torii et al .",
    "2015b , in prep . ) . considering the argument by @xcite that the effective jeans mass and probably the mass of the forming stars are proportional to the third power of the colliding velocity , it is likely that the exciting o star in rcw120 was formed in a short timescale at the beginning of the collision when the colliding velocity is still fast . the mass accretion rate to from the o star is estimated to be @xmath144@xmath7yr@xmath1 for a stellar mass of @xmath420@xmath7 by assuming that the accreting timescale is @xmath40.4myr .",
    "such a high mass accretion rate is consistent with those revealed in the numerical calculations of ccc @xcite and the theoretical studies on high - mass star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a similar short timescale of @xmath145myr for the high - mass star formation is observationally derived in the super star clusters ngc3603 and westerlund1 by careful optical studies of the young star by hst and vlt @xcite .",
    "the short timescale in these clusters was studied with semi - analytical models by @xcite , in which a strong increase in the star formation efficiency per unit time is required .",
    "we here summarize the ccc in rcw120 .",
    "about 0.4myr ago , the collision occurred between the large red cloud with size 12pc and mass @xmath102@xmath7 and the small blue cloud with size @xmath43.5pc and mass @xmath41000@xmath7 , which was accompanied by the v - shape cloud with @xmath104@xmath7 . by assuming the decelerated colliding velocity of @xmath415kms@xmath1 and the cloud motion having an angle of 45@xmath121 to the line - of - sight , the cavity was rapidly created in the red cloud in a short timescale of 0.4myr , forming the compressed layer with mass of 20004000@xmath7 , whose number density increased to @xmath146cm@xmath6 from @xmath8cm@xmath6 through the collision .",
    "the cavity creation stopped inside the red cloud at the depth 5pc , where the colliding small cloud was dissipated into the compressed layer .",
    "massive clump formation and subsequent o star formation proceeded along with the cavity creation at a large mass accretion rate up to @xmath90@xmath7yr@xmath1 .",
    "after the birth of the o star , an hii region with mass @xmath4200@xmath7 was immediately created , and filled out the cavity and began interaction with the surrounding dense layer , which is now observed as the molecular ring .",
    "the dense compressed layer was porous , and so the ionized gas partly ( @xmath425% ) streamed out though it @xcite .",
    "the ionized gas just reached the opening of the cavity where the v - shape cloud is currently located , and now it is the very beginning of the erosion by the ionized stream which can be observed as the complementary distribution between the blue cloud and the hii region . by assuming the velocity of the ionized gas of 10kms@xmath1 @xcite , the timescale to fill the cavity with the ionized gas is calculated to be 0.5myr for the cavity s depth 5pc , which is consistent with our estimate of the timescale of the ccc in rcw120 .",
    "the present ccc model in figure[ccc_model2 ] predicts secondary ccc in rcw120 . as shown in figure[nasco](c ) , the co peak in the right side of the v - shape coincides with a local co peak in the red cloud .",
    "in addition , broad velocity features which connect the red cloud and the blue cloud are found in the hi emission ( figure[nasco_lv ] ) .",
    "the bridging feature in velocity may be understood as an intermediate velocity feature expected in an early stage of ccc .",
    "@xcite discussed that , by using the data of the numerical calculations of ccc in @xcite , the turbulent motion in the compressed layer can be observed in a position - velocity diagram as intermediate velocity features connecting two colliding clouds . on the other hand ,",
    "one single broad velocity feature is identified with the co dataset at the rim of the v - shape cloud toward the direction of condensation 6 with some ysos ( figure[nasco]c ) .",
    "these observational signatures may indicate the early stage of another collision between the v - shape cloud and the top of the red cloud as shown in figure[ccc_model2 ] .",
    "if it is correct , the coinciding co peaks may correspond to the compressed layer by the collision .",
    "unfortunately , our mopra and aste observations did not cover these coinciding peaks and high velocity features , and in order to investigate the present idea and the possibility of the triggered star formation in future , further detailed observations of a large area are necessary .",
    "formation of the second generation stars in the context of ccc is another issue to be addressed .",
    "ysos and their evolutional stages in rcw120 were investigated by @xcite based on the _",
    "spitzer_/glimpse point source catalog .",
    "subsequently , @xcite made identification for the 138 sources whose positions and 24@xmath13 m brightnesses were iteratively measured from the _",
    "spitzer_/mips 24@xmath13 m maps .",
    "the main difference between these two studies is that in @xcite many ysos are distributed inside the 8@xmath13 m ring , while in @xcite there are almost no ysos inside the ring . using the carefully measured 24@xmath13 m stellar samples , @xcite applied various criteria for a wide range of wavelength from near - infrared to 24@xmath13 m , making their yso identification firm and reliable , and we thus adopt the deharveng s catalog in the present study .",
    "it is , however , noted that a completeness issue possibly remains in the deharveng s catalog , particularly toward inside the 8@xmath13 m ring , because emission from warm dust grains heated by the o star is predominant there , making it difficult to make reliable identification of the ysos ( see figure [ rgb ] ) . in fact , the statistical studies of the stellar distributions in the spitzer bubbles indicate significant detection of stars within the bubbles @xcite .",
    "analysing their numerical calculations of the triggered star formation by hii region , @xcite pointed out that the yso distributions are peaked around the ionization front , and discussed that the existence of stars inside the bubbles seen in the observational studies can be explained as projection effects of three dimensional structures .",
    "same as many other spitzer bubbles , rcw120 possibly harbors the ysos inside the 8@xmath13 m ring , although we have to await for future observations to better understand the yso distribution in rcw120 .    a most remarkable yso feature identified in rcw120",
    "so far is seen in condensation 1 , where a chain of ysos are aligned parallel to the rim of the 8@xmath13 m ring @xcite .",
    "these authors discussed that the ysos were formed via gravitational instabilities in the collected layer created by a pressure driven hii region .",
    "other ysos in rcw120 may also be explained by the interactions with the hii region @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "another possibility is raised in the ccc scenario .",
    "as already discussed , the high - mass star was likely formed in a short timescale at the beginning of the collision when the colliding velocity was fast .",
    "then , it is possible that the low - mass star formation may be triggered in a later stage when the colliding velocity becomes even smaller .",
    "it is interesting to note a speculation that the chain of ysos located near the symmetry axis of the collision may have been formed under triggering in the final stage of the collision , where the cloud motion was significantly decelerated to a velocity much less than 30kms@xmath1 .",
    "the low velocity will lead to smaller turbulent motion and smaller mass accretion rate in the compressed layer , providing a possible alternative to the conventional idea of triggering by the o star ionization .",
    "the conclusions of the present work are summarized as follows ;    1 .",
    "we performed co @xmath0=10 and @xmath0=32 observations toward the galactic hii region rcw120 , which has a beautiful infrared ring , with the nanten2 , mopra , and aste telescopes , and have identified two molecular clouds associated with rcw120 around radial velocities of @xmath2kms@xmath1 and @xmath3kms@xmath1 .",
    "the former ( the red cloud ) with total molecular mass of @xmath147@xmath7 has a ring - like component surrounding the hii region in rcw120 .",
    "the latter ( the blue cloud ) with total molecular mass of @xmath148@xmath7 has a v - shape at the north of the opening of the 8@xmath13 m ring . both of the red cloud and the blue cloud show high @xmath16co @xmath0=32/@xmath0=10 ratio of @xmath149 and high kinetic temperatures of @xmath150k , suggesting that they are heated by the exciting o star and/or by the hii region in rcw120 .",
    "these observational signatures suggest that , despite of a large velocity separation of 20kms@xmath1 , the blue cloud as well as the red cloud is physically associated with the hii region in rcw120 .",
    "the large velocity separation can not be understood as a gravitationally bound system .",
    "an expanding hii region is an idea to understand the origin of the molecular gas in rcw120 . in the assumption of uniform density distribution ,",
    "collect & collapse ( c&c ) is expected to form a dense shell layer , which may explain the observed signature of rcw120 .",
    "our observations , however , indicate no expanding motion in the velocity distribution of the molecular gas , which is inconsistent with what is expected in c&c .",
    "the theoretical studies on the non - uniform density distributions also do not provide a plausible explanation for the main observational signatures , i.e. , the intensity distributions of the molecular ring in the red cloud , coexistence of the two clouds with a large velocity separation of 20kms@xmath1 , and absence of the expanding motion .",
    "3 .   we postulate the scenario that a collision between the red cloud and the blue cloud triggered the formation of the exciting o star in rcw120 in a short timescale of 0.20.4myr .",
    "the basic idea of the present cloud - cloud collision ( ccc ) scenario was first given by @xcite .",
    "in this scenario , the velocity separation of 20kms@xmath1 can be interpreted as a projection of the colliding velocity .",
    "once the collision occurred , a cavity was created in the red cloud , followed by the o star formation in the compressed layer at the interface of the two clouds .",
    "the strong uv radiation from the o star then illuminates the inner surface of the cavity , making it observable at 8@xmath13 m as a ring structure .",
    "the present ccc scenario provides a possible explanation for the present observations , and if this is correct , the rcw120 provides the second case of the ccc triggering the formation of one single o star next to m20 .",
