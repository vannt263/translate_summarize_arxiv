    "most stars are member of binary systems and it is therefore important that a complete star formation theory be able to predict the binary fraction , period distribution , and mass - ratio distribution of stellar objects across a wide range of masses .",
    "furthermore , the study of individual binary systems is the only direct means to determine fundamental stellar properties such as stellar masses and radii .",
    "recent high - resolution imaging studies of brown dwarfs ( bds ) and very low - mass ( vlm ) stars have placed strong constraints on binaries with separations of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) observations of @xmath5  per and the pleiades indicates a binary fraction ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath7  per  cent with a bias towards separations ( @xmath8 ) of less than @xmath9  au , and a mass - ratio ( @xmath10 ) of @xmath11 @xcite for objects around and below the hydrogen burning limit ( see also @xcite ) . a similar lack of wide binaries was found in the field t - dwarf study @xcite , while @xmath12  per  cent ( for the field objects with 0.030.1  @xmath13 and m8.0l0.5 ) was determined by @xcite using the adaptive optics at gemini north .",
    "they also found the vast majority of systems have a semimajor axis @xmath14 ( see also @xcite but note too the results of @xcite ) .",
    "study of more than 80 field late m and l dwarfs @xcite indicated @xmath12  per  cent with separations in the range of 1.616  au . for a small ( 12 )",
    "sample of bds and vlm stars ( 0.040.1  @xmath15 ) in upper scorpius ob association ( uscoob ) , @xcite found @xmath16  per  cent for @xmath17 by using a similar imaging technique .",
    "more recently , @xcite , combined with the results of earlier works , found the upper limit of the overall binary fraction for vlm stars of @xmath18  per  cent .    using a monte carlo simulation , the data from radial velocity surveys available in the literature , and by carefully considering the sensitivity and sampling biases",
    ", @xcite found an overall bd / vlm binary frequency of 3245 per  cent assuming @xmath19  per  cent for @xmath20  au . a recent photometric study @xcite of low - mass objects in pleiades and praesepe suggested , albeit indirectly , @xmath6 as large as 50  per  cent . which would only be compatible with direct imaging studies if 7080  per  cent of those binaries have @xmath21 . for a more comprehensive review of the current status of bd",
    "/ vlm binary fraction and the separation distribution , readers are refer to a recent review of multiplicity studies by @xcite .",
    "the extensive imaging surveys provide excellent observational constraints on wider bd+bd binaries , but it is now necessary to search for shorter period bd+bd binaries systematically .",
    "binaries with the separation of less than 1  au are not resolved by current imaging techniques , but will be detectable as spectroscopic binaries , providing the mass - ratio is not too extreme , and velocity separation is large enough .",
    "the first bd+bd spectroscopic binary , ppl  15 @xcite , showed a double - peaked cross - correlation function with a maximum velocity separation of @xmath22 .",
    "the binary was found to have an eccentric orbit ( @xmath23 ) with a period of @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the formation process of substellar objects is biased towards smaller separation binaries based on the short period of ppl  15 and the lack of pleiades bd binaries with separations @xmath25 .",
    "note that the median separation of binaries with solar - type primaries is 30  au @xcite .",
    "pioneering work on the rvs of bds and vlms are presented by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who found a several binary candidates ; however , the orbital parameters and masses of binaries remains unknown because the follow - up spectroscopic monitoring is lacking or is still being undertaken .",
    "in addition to the follow - up observations , the number of bds and vlm star binary candidates needs to be increased in order to have better statistics on short - period binary parameters .",
    "the first bd+bd eclipsing binary ( 2mass j0532184j0546085 ) was discovered by @xcite from the @xmath26-band photometric monitoring of the system . combining their light curves and the results from the follow - up radial velocity measurements",
    ", they were able to determined the precise orbital and physical parameters of the system .",
    "the projected semimajor axis and the period of the binary are found as @xmath27  au and @xmath28  d respectively .",
    "the separation distribution of bd / vlm binaries is critical to understanding their origin .",
    "there are two main models for the formation of bds and vlm stars : first , they have low masses because they form in low - mass , dense molecular cloud cores ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; second , bd / vlm objects have low masses because they are ejected from the dense core in which they form via dynamical interactions in multiple system , cutting off their accretion before they have reached stellar masses ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . alternatively , there is a third model in which a free - floating bd or planetary - mass object can be formed in the process of the photo - evaporation ( e.g.  @xcite ;  @xcite ) with the outer layers of a pre - stellar core ( @xmath29 ) removed by the strong radiation pressure from the nearby massive ob stars before the accretion onto the protostar at core centre occurs .    due to the dynamical interaction involved in the second model , bd / vlm binaries that survive",
    "are generally expected to have small separations . in the first model , wider binaries",
    "may be expected to be more common .",
    "@xcite suggested that close binaries ( @xmath30 ) do not form directly , but result from hardening of wider systems though a combination of dynamical interactions , accretion and interactions with circum - binary discs .",
    "if bd / vlm binaries have formed through such mechanisms , one would not expect to find binaries with 110  au separations without also finding many with separation @xmath31  au .",
    "if an absence / rarity of binaries with 1  au were found , it may support the idea that they are ejected quickly from multiple systems before they have undergone the interactions that shorten their periods .",
    "our immediate aim is to identify spectroscopic and close bd / vlm binaries using the high - resolution echelle spectroscopy at two epochs .",
    "this experiment is sensitive to vlm binaries with separations of @xmath1  au which corresponds to a period of @xmath32",
    ". a larger sample of candidates will enable us to measure the binary fraction of these short - period / close binaries ( once confirmed ) , and address whether there is a significant population of ` hidden ' vlm companions .",

    ". the larger the time separation of observations , the larger the upper limit of the semimajor axis to which an observation is sensitive . the average time separation of the two - epoch rv observations of our targets is @xmath68  d. in the following , we will briefly discuss our model assumptions and parameters which are essentially the same as those of @xcite but with some simplifications .",
    "there are six basic parameters in our monte carlo simulation : primary mass ( @xmath69 ) , mass ratio ( @xmath10 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath70 ) , orbital phase ( @xmath71 ) , orbital inclination ( @xmath72 ) , longitude of periastron ( @xmath73 ) .",

    "the mass ratio is assumed to be uniformly distributed between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the eccentricity @xmath70 is assumed to be zero ( circular orbits ) .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found the detection probability is insensitive to the assumed distribution of @xmath10 and @xmath70 . the orbital phase is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 .",
    "the inclination @xmath72 is randomly chosen from the cumulative distribution of @xmath77 .",
    "the longitude of periastron @xmath73 is not necessary since we assumed @xmath78 .    in order to compute the detection probability as a function of semimajor axis @xmath8 , we take the following procedure : ( 1 )  for each object in our targets , we randomly select @xmath79 binaries using the assumption stated above for a given value of @xmath8 , and compute the rv of the primary ( @xmath80 ) , ( 2 )  evolve the orbit by the time separation of the rv measurements used in the observations for this object , and take another simulated measurement of rv ( @xmath81 ) , ( 3 )  from @xmath80 , @xmath81 and the average uncertainty in rv ( @xmath67 ) from the observations , we compute the @xmath82 probability @xmath59 , and flag the trial as a detection if @xmath83 as done for the real data , ( 4 )  find the fraction of detections out of all random trials , ( 5 ) repeat 14 for the range of @xmath8 between @xmath84  and 10  au , and ( 6 ) repeat 5 for the all targets , and find the detection probability averaged over all targets as a function of @xmath8 .    the result of the simulation is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : detect_prob ] .",
    "the detection probability curve shown here is very similar that of @xcite for a constant time separation ( 20  d ) case ( see their fig .  4 ) .",
    "the probability remains fairly constant up to @xmath85 , and it rapidly decreases beyond @xmath86 .",

    "an alternative explanation for the rv variations found in the binary candidates above is a type of stellar pulsations found by @xcite .",
    "they studied the non - adiabatic , linear instability of very vlm stars and bd during the deuterium burning phase in the core , and found unstable fundamental modes in the time - scale between @xmath89 and @xmath90  h for the object mass from @xmath91 and @xmath92 . by using their pulsation periods and by assuming that the pulsation amplitudes is 5  per  cent of the radius of the objects",

    "we have measured the rv from each spectrum to check if there is a large jump in the rv measurements on a short time - scale .",
    "the size of the shifts in the rv values measured in the two consecutive spectra are found in between @xmath95 ( usco  128 ) and @xmath96 ( usco  66 ) , and the average size of the shifts @xmath97 , which is much smaller than the expected rv variation based on the models of @xcite ; hence , we found little indication of the pulsations in our sample .",
    "we have presented two - epoch rv survey of 18 young bds and vlm stars ( @xmath98 ) in uscoob and @xmath0  oph dark cloud core using the high resolution uves echelle spectroscopy at vlt .",
    "the average time separation of rv measurements are 21.6  d , and our rv survey is sensitive to binaries with separation smaller than 0.1  au .",
    "one of our targets , usco  121 , is most likely a non - member of the uscoob association based on the deviation of the rv from the result of the population in the association .",
    "a similar conclusion was found by @xcite from their rv study and the low lithium abundance .",
    "we found 4 ( usco  112 , usco  128 , usco  40 and usco  55 ) out of 17 objects as our binary / multiple candidates .",
    "this corresponds to the binary fraction of @xmath2  per  cent for the binary separation @xmath99  au .",
    "the recent high - resolution imaging survey of brown dwarfs and very low - mass objects ( m5.5m7.5 ) in the uscoob by @xcite ( which was not known to authors at the time of our observation : april  may , 2004 ) confirms that usco  55 and usco  66 are multiple systems , and usco  109 is most likely a multiple system .",
    "their projected separations are @xmath100  au which is well above our sensitivity limit of 0.1  au ; therefore , it is not surprising that we did not identify usco  66 and usco  109 as multiples .",
    "interestingly , we also found usco  55 as a candidate for a multiple system .",
    "this may indicate that it is a triple system with one of the objects located within 0.1  au of the primary .",
    "in addition , we identify usco  112 and 128 as binary candidates , but they did not find them as multiples .",
    "further they found usco  67 , 75 , 130 and 132 as non - multiple , as did we .",
    "we found the rv dispersion ( @xmath34 ) of the objects in uscoob is very similar to that of the bds and vlm stars in chamaeleon  i ( cha  i ) previous study by @xcite . the rotational velocities ( @xmath3 ) of the samples were also measured .",
    "the distribution of @xmath3 for the uscoob objects peaks around @xmath50 which is also similar to that of the cha  i population found by @xcite ; however , the dispersion of @xmath3 for the uscoob objects ( @xmath101 ) is found to be much larger than that of the cha  i objects ( @xmath53 )    follow - up spectroscopic observations of the binary candidates presented here are planned in near future .",
    "there are only a few rv variable binary candidates identified in earlier surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as @xcite points out most of the current rv and imaging surveys use samples from magnitude - limited survey , but one should attempt to use the samples from volume - limited survey in order to find a correct statistics on binary parameters more straightforwardly , i.e. without correcting for bias .",
