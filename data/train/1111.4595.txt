    "<S> this result agrees with the contribution to @xmath143 from the torsion - induced spin - spin interaction , @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> the singularity theorems , however , have another important component : the raychaudhuri equation , which describes the time evolution of the expansion scalar for timelike congruences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion scalar @xmath145 measures the fractional rate at which a small volume of matter changes with time as measured by a comoving observer . because of the raychaudhuri equation , timelike geodesics for the matter satisfying the strong energy condition converge ( @xmath146 decreases ) , resulting in a caustic , @xmath147 ( if @xmath146 decreases continuously ) , and thus in a singularity within a finite proper time @xcite .    for the cosmological fluid in the comoving frame , </S>",
    "<S> the flrw metric gives @xmath148 . </S>",
    "<S> since the universe at the minimum scale factor @xmath99 undergoes a bounce from @xmath131 to @xmath132 , the expansion scalar has a discontinuity there , increasing from @xmath149 to @xmath150 . as the universe before the big bounce contracts </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath146 decreases from some value given by the initial condition of the contraction to a value @xmath151 . at @xmath120 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath146 jumps to @xmath152 . as the universe </S>",
    "<S> after the bounce expands , @xmath146 decreases towards zero . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity of the expansion scalar at the cusp - like big bounce therefore prevents @xmath146 from decreasing to @xmath153 and reaching a curvature singularity , and guarantees that timelike geodesics in the universe with dirac fields coupled to torsion continue through the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> a similar discontinuity completes timelike geodesics in the gravitational field of an einstein - rosen bridge @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the early universe contained only known standard - model particles , then @xmath154 and @xmath155 @xcite , so the temperature at the big bounce ( [ critical ] ) was @xmath156 as the reference values , we can take the temperature and scale factor at the matter - radiation equality , where the radiation - dominated era ends . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore have @xmath157 ev and @xmath158 , where @xmath159 m is the present scale factor @xcite and @xmath160 is the redshift at the matter - radiation equality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the values at the big bounce of the scale factor ( [ minimum ] ) , antipodal velocity and density parameter were , respectively : @xmath161 the value ( [ antipodal ] ) is enormous , whereas ( [ finetuning ] ) differs from 1 by a quantity that is extremely small in magnitude , like in the spin - fluid cosmology with torsion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such extreme values result from @xmath162 .    </S>",
    "<S> the big - bounce value of @xmath163 is on the order of @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the spinor - torsion density parameter @xcite , subscript @xmath0 denotes radiation , and 0 denotes the present value . </S>",
    "<S> an enormous value of @xmath166 is related to an extremely small magnitude of @xmath165 : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the critical density and @xmath169 is the hubble parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent fine tuning of @xmath170 is thus caused by @xmath171 , originating from an extremely weak spinor - torsion coupling in the ecks gravity , as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , such a coupling naturally explains why the present universe at largest scales appears nearly flat , solving the flatness problem without introducing exotic matter fields necessary for cosmological inflation .    </S>",
    "<S> this coupling is also responsible for an extremely rapid expansion of the universe after the big bounce . </S>",
    "<S> such an expansion produces an enormous number of causally disconnected volumes , @xmath172 , from a single causally connected region ( the closed universe before and at the big bounce ) , naturally explaining why the present universe at largest scales appears homogeneous and isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> the spinor - torsion coupling therefore solves the horizon problem without inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from the torsion - dominated era to the radiation - dominated era occurs naturally as the contribution from this coupling to the friedman equations ( [ fri1 ] ) and ( [ fri2 ] ) rapidly weakens ( according to @xmath173 ) , which is another advantage of this scenario . </S>"
