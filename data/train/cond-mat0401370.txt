    "the concept of the tetragonal distortion of a face - centered cubic lattice into a body - centered cubic lattice , as well as the reverse transformation , was introduced by bain in 1924@xcite as a model for the formation of martensite in steels .",
    "although this model is not exactly correct,@xcite the concept of the `` bain path '' has been useful in investigating the behavior of element and compound metallic systems . this usefulness has increased with the development of total energy electronic structure methods , which can investigate regions of the bain path not accessible by experimental methods . by following the bain path from fcc to bcc",
    ", mehl and boyer@xcite ( in the following referred to as mb ) showed that the fcc elements aluminum and iridium are elastically unstable in the bcc phase , i.e. , the bain path reaches a local maximum at the position of the bcc lattice .",
    "et al._,@xcite did first - principles calculations of the bain path of gold and platinum which showed that these elements were also unstable in the bcc phase .",
    "in addition they used the reverse bain path , from bcc to fcc , to show that tantalum and tungsten were elastically unstable in the fcc phase .",
    "craievich , _",
    "et al._,@xcite looked at the fcc elements nickel and rhodium , which were unstable in the bcc state , and the bcc elements cobalt , chromium , molybdenum , niobium , tantalum , and vanadium , which were elastically unstable in the fcc state .",
    "jona and marcus showed that both bcc copper@xcite and palladium@xcite are also elastically unstable along the bain path .",
    "even metals which are only metastable in the fcc phase , e.g. , cobalt , manganese , osmium , rhenium , ruthenium , titanium , and hafnium,@xcite are elastically unstable to bain path distortions in the bcc phase .",
    "the above lists demonstrate that for elements to the right of the alkaline earths on the periodic table , a stable or metastable fcc ( bcc ) phase implies an elastically unstable bcc ( fcc ) phase .",
    "this , however , does not end the search for metastable phases along the bain path . as noted by craievich , _",
    "et al._,@xcite the existence of a minimum and a local maximum in the bain path implies the existence of another local minimum . this minimum must be outside the classical bain path from fcc to bcc , though this does not preclude the existence of yet another minimum between fcc and bcc .",
    "mb@xcite found a local minimum in the extended bain path of aluminum by compressing along the [ 001 ] direction until @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fcc phase and @xmath2 the bcc phase .",
    "iridium was found to have a minimum at @xmath3 .",
    "these minima are very close to the special value @xmath4 , where the body - centered tetragonal lattice is 10-fold coordinated ( bct@xmath5 ) .",

    "there is no increased coordination at this site .",
    "experimentally this structure is observed in indium,@xcite and has the _ strukturbericht _ designation a6.@xcite    given the increased coordination near the secondary minimum in the bain path for fcc crystals , one is tempted to conclude that this state is metastable .",
    "this turns out not to be the case .",
    "as found by boyer,@xcite there is an orthorhombic `` magic strain '' ( properly , physically allowed lattice - invariant ( pali ) strain ) which transforms one fcc lattice into another fcc lattice . a similar",
    "orthorhombic magic strain transforms one bcc lattice into another .",
    "mb showed that the magic strain path for fcc aluminum passes through the secondary minimum of the aluminum bain path , and that , when viewed in the space of the orthorhombic strains , this point is actually a saddle point and hence unstable . in terms of the elastic constants , @xmath13 for the secondary minimum is negative .",
    "jona and marcus demonstrated this instability by direct calculation of the elastic constants of copper@xcite and palladium@xcite at the secondary bain path minimum .",
    "the concept of magic strains was generalized by van de waal@xcite and applied to the study of metastable structures in various systems , including silicon@xcite and model two dimensional lattices.@xcite in this paper we use the formalism to show that the secondary minimum along the bain path of an elemental fcc or bcc solid is unstable with respect to an orthorhombic shear .",
    "we note that this need not be the case for more complicated unit cells ",
    "the metastable bct5 state of silicon@xcite was found using the concept of magic strains .",
    "the magic strain formalism is a useful tool for searching for metastable structures.@xcite indeed , this paper can be considered to be a search for metastable states due to orthorhombic distortions of stable fcc and bcc crystals . in this case , however , we will show that there are no such states .    in section  [ sec : bain ]",
    ", we show an extension of the bain path for both fcc and bcc metals . in section  [ sec : ortho ] we show the construction of the orthorhombic strains required for fcc @xmath14 fcc and bcc @xmath14 bcc magic strains and explore large regions of strain space using parametrized fits to first - principles results via the nrl tight - binding method.@xcite these results show that , within the tight - binding model of fcc and bcc metals the bain path minima discussed above are elastically unstable . in section  [ sec : cij ] we employ first - principles density functional theory methods to directly compute the elastic constants for structures at the secondary bain path minimum .",
