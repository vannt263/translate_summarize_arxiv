    "gravitational solitons in general relativity describe gravitational solitonic waves propagating in a certain background spacetime .",
    "in particular , the use of inverse scattering method leads to a lot of discoveries of various physically interesting exact solutions  @xcite .",
    "it should be especially mentioned that this method can generate black hole solutions in an axisymmetric and stationary case  @xcite , in addition to exact solutions describing nonlinear gravitational waves on various physical backgrounds .",
    "this method can be generalized to the higher - dimensional einstein equations  @xcite , but in general such a simple generalization to higher dimensions tends to lead to singular solutions .",
    "however , pomeransky  @xcite modified the original inverse scattering method  @xcite so that it can generate regular solutions even in higher dimensions .",
    "in fact , with regard to vacuum solutions in five dimensions , all currently known asymptotically flat black hole solutions can be discovered or rederived by this method  @xcite .    in a cylindrically symmetric case , a diagonal form of a metric",
    "makes the vacuum einstein equations extremely simple structure of a linear wave equation in a flat background .",
    "for instance , the einstein - rosen metric can be interpreted as superposition of cylindrical gravitational waves with the @xmath0 mode only  @xcite . however , the existence of off - diagonal nonzero components of a metric drastically changes the structure of the einstein equations and it yields the @xmath1 mode together with nonlinearity .",
    "et al_.  @xcite numerically studied the nonlinear interaction of cylindrical gravitational waves with both polarization modes such as the gravitational faraday effect .",
    "tomimatsu  @xcite studied the gravitational faraday rotation for the cylindrical gravitational solitons generated by the inverse scattering technique  @xcite .",
    "as one of new attempts to understand strong gravitational effects , one of the present authors has recently constructed the cylindrically symmetric soliton solutions from a minkowski seed by the pomeransky inverse scattering method , and has clarified the behavior of the soliton solution including the effect similar to the gravitational faraday rotation  @xcite .    in our previous paper , using the pomeransky inverse scattering method and regarding the levi - civit metric as a seed , we constructed the one - soliton solution that does not admit staticity but cylindrical symmetry  @xcite .",
    "although levi - civit spacetime has singularities on the axis except for minkowski spacetime , we showed that for the one - soliton solution , such singularities disappear by a certain choice of parameters .",
    "however , this solution has singularities on the light cone for any parameters , which is an unavoidable common property for all one - soliton solutions with a real pole and is well known that such a problem can be resolved by considering two - soliton solutions with two complex - conjugate poles .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will construct a two - soliton solution with two complex conjugate poles by the pomeransky method and the levi - civit seed .",
    "furthermore , we will show that for certain parameters , the spacetime is entirely free from any singularities even on the axis as well as on the light cone .    in the following section",
    ", we will present a two - soliton solution with complex conjugate poles in levi - civit spacetime . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we will analyze the obtained two - soliton solution by computing the amplitudes and polarization angles for ingoing and outgoing waves and will see the difference from the one - soliton solution . in sec .",

    "the regular solutions with @xmath125 describe the propagation of gravitational wave packets that come into the region near the symmetric axis from past null infinity , then leave for future null infinity after reflection at the axis .",

    "we have seen that these effects are essentially similar to the case of @xmath47 , which was investigated in  @xcite .    finally , we point out the essential differences of two - soliton solutions with @xmath125 from ones with @xmath47 .",

    "\\(ii ) timelike infinity @xmath126 :    for @xmath47 , the spacetime asymptotically approaches minkowski , and simultaneously both ingoing and outgoing gravitational waves fade into the background spacetime .",

    "the spacetime is not asymptotically minkowski and both ingoing and outgoing wave amplitudes do not vanish .",

    "\\(iii ) null infinity @xmath128 or @xmath129 :    even though the asymptotic forms of the metric at null infinity entirely differ for each of @xmath17 , the asymptotic forms of wave packet are exactly same . therefore ,",
    "as happens for @xmath47 , for @xmath125 , two gravitational solitons can coalesce into a single soliton , and also that a single soliton can split into two via the nonlinear effect of gravitational waves .",
