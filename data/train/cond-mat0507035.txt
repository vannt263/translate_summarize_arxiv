    "random matrix theory provides a unified theoretical description of weak localization , universal conductance fluctuations , and shot noise in ballistic or diffusive cavities.@xcite    if the electron motion is diffusive , the dynamics is fully quantum mechanical already at times much shorter than the time @xmath2 required for ergodic exploration of the cavity s phase space . for ballistic cavities",
    "this is true in most practical applications as well  the ehrenfest time @xmath3 usually does not exceed the time of flight through the cavity  but there is no fundamental reason why @xmath0 always has to be small .",
    "the case of large ehrenfest times is of theoretical interest , as it is one of very few regimes in parameter space in which one can observe differences between signatures of quantum transport in ballistic chaotic and diffusive cavities .",

    "the reason is that @xmath0 depends only logarithmically on the product of the electron wavenumber @xmath8 and the cavity size @xmath9 , @xmath10 for two - dimensional cavities , system sizes at which @xmath11 can not be simulated with present - day algorithms and processor speeds . in order to circumvent this problem , jacquod , schomerus , and beenakker proposed to replace the cavity by a quantum map.@xcite the map is opened , so that simulation of transport properties is possible .",

    "all ambiguities are resolved .    to calculate the total transmission and reflection in terms of diffusons , it is useful to obtain expressions for scattering matrix elements using the retarded green function of the cavity .",
