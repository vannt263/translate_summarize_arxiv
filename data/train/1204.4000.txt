    "the need for low - complexity decodable stbcs is inevitable in the case of high - rate communications over mimo systems employing a number of transmit antennas higher than two .",
    "the decoding complexity may be evaluated by different measures , namely the worst - case decoding complexity measure and the average decoding complexity measure .",
    "the worst - case decoding complexity is defined as the minimum number of times an exhaustive search decoder has to compute the maximum likelihood ( ml ) metric to optimally estimate the transmitted symbols codeword @xcite , or equivalently the number of leaf nodes in a search tree if a sphere decoder is employed , whereas the average decoding complexity measure may be numerically evaluated as the average number of visited nodes by a sphere decoder in order to optimally estimate the transmitted symbols codeword @xcite . arguably , the first proposed low - complexity rate-1 code for the case of four transmit antennas is the quasi - orthogonal ( qo)stbc originally proposed by h. jafarkhani @xcite and later optimized through constellation rotation to provide full diversity @xcite .",
    "the qostbc partially relaxes the orthogonality conditions by allowing two complex symbols to be jointly detected .",
    "subsequently , rate-1 , full - diversity qostbcs were proposed for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas that subsume the original qostbc as a special case @xcite . in this general framework ,",
    "the _ quasi - orthgonality _ stands for decoupling the transmitted symbols into two groups of the same size .",
    "however , stbcs with lower decoding complexity may be obtained through the concept of multi - group decodability laid by the s. karmakar _",
    "_ in @xcite",
    ". indeed , the multi - group decodability generalizes the quasi - orthogonality by allowing more than two groups of symbols to be decoupled not necessarily with the same size .",
    "however , due to the strict rate limitation imposed by the multi - group decodability , another family of stbcs namely fast decodable ( fd ) stbcs @xcite has been proposed .",
    "these codes are conditionally multi - group decodable thus enabling the use of the conditional detection technique @xcite which in turn significantly reduces the overall decoding complexity .",
    "recently , stbcs that combine the multi - group decodability and the fast decodability namely the fast - group decodable ( fgd ) codes have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these codes are multi - group - group decodable such that each group of symbols is fast decodable .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized in the following :    * we propose a novel systematic construction of rate-1 fgd stbcs for @xmath0 transmit antennas .",
    "the rate-1 fgd code for a number of transmit antennas that is not a power of two is obtained by removing the appropriate number of columns from the rate-1 fgd code corresponding to the nearest greater number of antennas that is a power of two ( e.g. the rate-1 fgd stbc for three transmit antennas is obtained by removing a single column from the four transmit antennas rate-1 fgd stbc ) .",
    "* we apply our new construction method to the case of four transmit antennas and show that the resulting new 4@xmath24 rate-1 code can be decoded at half the worst - case decoding complexity of the best known rate-1 stbc . *",
    "the coding gain of the new 4@xmath24 rate-1 code is optimized through constellation stretching @xcite and the nonvanishing determinant ( nvd ) property @xcite is proven to be achieved by properly choosing the stretching factor .",
    "* we propose a new rate-2 stbc through multiplexing two of the new rate-1 codes by the means of a unitary matrix and numerical optimization .",
    "we then propose a significant reduction of the worst - decoding complexity at the expense of a rate loss by puncturing the rate-2 code to obtain a new rate-3/2 code .",
    "we compare the proposed codes to existing stbcs in the literature and found through numerical simulations that our rate-3/2 code has a significantly lower average decoding complexity while our rate-2 code is decoded with a lower average decoding complexity at low snr region .",
    "performance simulations show that this reduction in the decoding complexity comes at the expense of a small performance loss .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the system model is defined and the families of low - complexity stbcs are outlined in section ii . in section iii",
    "we propose our scheme for the rate-1 fgd codes construction for the case of @xmath0 transmit antennas , and then the fgd code construction method is applied to the case of four transmit antennas giving rise to a new 4@xmath24 rate-1 stbc . in section iv , the rate of the proposed code is increased through multiplexing and numerical optimization .",
    "numerical results are provided in section v , and we conclude the paper in section vi .      hereafter , small letters , bold small letters and bold capital letters will designate scalars , vectors and matrices , respectively .",
    "if @xmath3 is a matrix , then @xmath4 , and @xmath5 denote the hermitian and the transpose of @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we define the @xmath6 as the operator which , when applied to a @xmath7 matrix , transforms it into a @xmath8 vector by simply concatenating vertically the columns of the corresponding matrix .",
    "the @xmath9 operator is the kronecker product and the @xmath10 operator returns 1 if its scalar input is @xmath11 and -1 otherwise .",
    "the @xmath12 operator rounds its argument to the nearest integer .",
    "the @xmath13 operator concatenates vertically the real and imaginary parts of its argument .",
    "@xmath14 means @xmath15 modulo @xmath16 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ complexity ]    simulations are carried out in a quasi - static rayleigh fading channel in the presence of awgn and 2 receive antennas for our rate-3/2 and rate-2 codes .",
    "the ml detection is performed via a depth - first tree traversal with infinite initial radius sd .",

    "however , from fig . [ avcomqpsk ]",
    "one can notice that our proposed code maintains its lower average decoding complexity in the low snr region .",
    "in the present paper we have proposed a systematic approach for the construction of rate-1 fgd codes for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas .",
    "this approach when applied to the special case of four transmit antennas results in a new rate-1 fgd stbc that has the smallest worst - case decoding complexity among existing comparable low - complexity stbcs .",
    "the coding gain of the proposed fgd rate-1 code was then optimized through constellation stretching .",
    "next we managed to increase the rate to 2 by multiplexing two rate-1 codes through a unitary matrix .",
    "a compromise between complexity and throughput may be achieved through puncturing the proposed rate-2 code which results in a new low - complexity rate-3/2 code .",
    "the worst - case decoding complexity of the proposed codes is lower than their stbc counterparts in the literature .",
    "simulations results show that the proposed rate-3/2 code offers better performance that the s.sirianunpiboon _ et al .",
