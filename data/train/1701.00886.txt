    "a fundamental problem of option pricing is the explicit computation of discounted expected value which arise as prices of derivatives .",
    "efficient methods to compute such expectations are crucial in particular for calibration purposes . during a calibration procedure in each iteration step typically",
    "a large number of model prices has to be computed and compared to market prices .",
    "therefore , a fast yet accurate compute method is demanded .    a method which almost always works to get expectations is monte carlo simulation .",
    "its disadvantage is that it is computer intensive and therefore too slow for many purposes .",
    "another classical approach is to represent prices as solutions of partial ( integro- ) differential equations ( pdes .",
    "this approach applies to a wide range of valuation problems , in particular it allows to compute prices of american options as well .",
    "nevertheless the numerical solution of pides rests on sophisticated discretization methods and corresponding programs .",
    "a third approach is numerical integration methods .",
    "the latter type of methods is attractive from both practice and research point of view , as the fast computational speed , especially for plain vanilla options , makes it useful for calibration at financial institutions .",
    "usually numerical integration techniques are combined with the fourier transform or hilbert transform , and therefore , the numerical integration methods are often referred to as the  transform methods \" .",
    "the initial references for fourier transform methods to compute option prices are carr and madan ( 1999 ) and raible ( 2000 ) . whereas the first mentioned",
    "authors consider fourier transforms of appropriately modified call prices and then invert these , the second author starts with representing the option price as a convolution of the modified payoff and the log return density , then derives the bilateral laplace transform and finally inverts the resulting product . in both cases",
    "the result is an integral which can be evaluated numerically fast .",
    "a recent contribution to the transform method category is the cos method proposed in fang and oosterlee ( 2008)a numerical approximation based on the fourier cosine series expansion .",
    "fang and oosterlee ( 2008 ) show that the convergence rate for this method is exponential with linear computational complexity in most cases .",
    "the method was then used to price early - exercise and discrete barrier options in fang and oosterlee ( 2009 ) , asian options in zhang and oosterlee ( 2013 ) , and bermudan options in the heston model in fang and oosterlee ( 2011 ) .    as fang and oosterlee ( 2008 ) and",
    "zhang and oosterlee ( 2011 ) pointed : when pricing call options with the cos method , the method s accuracy may exhibit sensitivity regarding the choice of the domain size in which the series expansion is defined .",
    "a call payoff grows exponentially with the log - stock price which may introduce significant cancellation errors for large domain sizes .",
    "put options do not suffer from this , as their payoff value is bounded by the strike value . for pricing european calls , one can employ the well - known put - call parity or put - call duality and price calls via puts .    in this paper , we present a stable pricing of call options based on fourier cosine series expansion .",
    "since the conditional probability density function @xmath0 of the underlying decays to zero rapidly as @xmath1 , @xmath2 still decays to zero rapidly for appropriate values @xmath3 .",
    "we take fourier cosine series expansion for @xmath2 which allows us damping payoff function of option by a factor @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the growth rate of @xmath5 is decreased when @xmath6 and the cancellation error for large values of @xmath7 is reduced .",
    "the robustness of the pricing methods is demonstrated by error analysis , as well as by a series of numerical examples , including the heston stochastic volatility model , kou jump - diffusion model and cgmy model .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we present the option pricing problem and explain stable cos methods for the option pricing problem .",
    "the error analysis is also presented in this section .",
    "section 3 then presents a variety of numerical results , confirming our robust version of the cos valuation method .",
    "finally , section 6 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "let @xmath8 be a filtered probability space , where @xmath9 is a risk neutral measure , @xmath10 satisfies the usual hypotheses of completeness and right continuity , @xmath11 a finite terminal time .",
    "the asset price process @xmath12 is a stochastic process on the filtered probability space @xmath13 .",
    "let us consider a european type claim whose payoff at maturity @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a function on @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the strike price .",
    "the value of such claim at time 0 is given by the risk - neutral option valuation formula @xmath20=e^{-rt}\\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty}g(y)f_{t}(y|x)dy,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the current state , @xmath22 is the conditional density function , @xmath23 is the risk - free rate .",
    "we assume that the characteristic function of @xmath24 is known , which is the usually case , and the integrand is integrable , which is common for most problems we deal with .",
    "first , for given @xmath25 , we truncate the infinite integration ranges to some interval @xmath26\\subset\\mathbb{r}$ ] without loosing significant accuracy and obtain approximation @xmath27 @xmath28 as fang and oosterlee ( 2008 ) , @xmath26 $ ] can be taken @xmath26 $ ] as @xmath29-l\\sqrt{c_{2}[y_{t}]+\\sqrt{c_{4}[y_{t}]}}\\\\ b=&c_{1}[y_{t}]+l\\sqrt{c_{2}[y_{t}]+\\sqrt{c_{4}[y_{t } ] } } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 $ ] denotes the @xmath31-th cumulant of @xmath32 .      in fang - oosterlee cos method ,",
    "the conditional density function is approximated on a truncated domain , by a truncated fourier cosine expansion , which recovers the conditional density function from its characteristic function as follows : @xmath33\\cos\\bigg(k\\pi\\frac{y - a}{b - a}\\bigg),\\ ] ] with @xmath34 the characteristic function of @xmath22 and @xmath35 $ ] means taking the real part of the argument .",
    "the @xmath36 indicates that the first term in the summation is weighted by one - half .",
    "replacing @xmath22 by its approximation ( 4 ) in equation ( 3 ) and interchanging integration and summation gives the cos formula for computing the values of european options : @xmath37v_{k},\\ ] ] where : @xmath38 are the fourier cosine coefficients of @xmath39 , that are available in closed form for several payoff functions , like for plain vanilla puts and calls , but also for example for discontinuous payoffs like for digital options .",
    "it was shown in fang and oosterlee ( 2008 ) , that , with integration interval @xmath26 $ ] chosen sufficiently wide , the series truncation error dominates the overall error .",
    "for conditional density functions @xmath40 ) , the method converges exponentially ; otherwise convergence is algebraically",
    ".    however , when pricing call options , the solution s accuracy exhibits sensitivity regarding the size of this truncated domain .",
    "this holds specifically for call options under fat - tailed distributions , like under certain lvy jump processes , or for options with a very long time to maturity .",
    "a call payoff grows exponentially in log - stock price which may introduce cancellation errors for large domain sizes .",
    "a put option does not suffer from this ( see fang and oosterlee ( 2009 ) ) , as their payoff value is bounded by the strike value . in fang and oosterlee ( 2008 ) , european call options were therefore priced by means of european put option computations , in combination with the put - call parity : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the call and put option prices , respectively , and @xmath44 is again the dividend rate .",
    "the parity lead to robust formulas for pricing european call options by the cos method .      in this section",
    ", we present a robust pricing of european call options by fourier - cosine series expansion .",
    "since the density @xmath22 decays to zero rapidly as @xmath1 , we first modify the density @xmath22 by multiplying a factor @xmath45 , then take fourier - cosine expansion for @xmath46 which reads as @xmath47:=\\widetilde{f}_{t}(y|x)\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50dy.\\ ] ] then replace the density @xmath22 by @xmath51 in ( 2 ) , so we obtain @xmath52dy\\ ] ] we interchange the summation and integration , and insert the define @xmath53dy\\ ] ] resulting @xmath54    * remark 1 .",

    "@xmath3 can thus be seen as a damping factor .",
