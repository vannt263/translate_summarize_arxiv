    "the compact mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics developed in the late 1920 s continues as an extraordinarily successful representation of physical phenomena .",
    "the very compactness itself is widely perceived as evidence of the validity , beauty , and completeness of that formalism .",
    "this perception has persisted despite the evolving understanding over the years that strict adherence to the formalism imposes fundamental violations of classical physical reality .",
    "the resolution of these violations , given the constraints of that strict adherence , was understood by bohr and others to necessarily impose a non - real and non - local representation of the physical world .",
    "this representation is often referred to as the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics ( piqm ) and consists of those postulates thought to rationally express the physical implications of the underlying compact quantum formalism .",
    "the predictive validity of the quantum formalism is widely acknowledged .",
    "nevertheless , the piqm departures from local realism are not universally accepted .",
    "lepore and selleri @xcite contend that the development of local realism since the 1935 einstein , podolsky , and rosen s paper @xcite  is by far the most profound criticism of quantum mechanics ...  in reference to the probabilistic interpretation .",
    "popper raises compelling philosophical arguments in questioning the validity of piqm.@xcite    the notable non - local properties of piqm are manifestations of entanglement and wave - particle duality .",
    "any viable local alternative to piqm must minimally demonstrate an alternative self - consistent basis for both of these phenomena . in this regard",
    ", one of the present authors proposed a locally real representation of quantum mechanics that gives agreement with performed experiments for correlated photons and particles @xcite and is not restricted by bell s theorem.@xcite the other phenomenon , wave - particle duality , is examined by the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this report",
    "we again examine wave - particle duality and propose a locally real representation of quantum mechanics , identified here as lrqm , that retains the accepted underlying quantum formalism with minimal modification .    as a preliminary matter",
    ", we first consider some elementary aspects of photon phenomena from the particular perspective of lrqm as distinguished from piqm . in the discrete regime ,",
    "a single photon is a physically real wave packet structure on which a real energy quantum resides .",
    "the lrqm wave function @xmath3 characterizes the wave amplitude of this structure but is not itself a physical representation of any resident energy quantum .",
    "the separability of these entities is identified with de broglie s initial representations of quantum phenomena @xcite and is intrinsic to many locally real representations .",
    "born interpreted the squared modulus of the wave function evaluated at particular coordinates as a measure of relative probability of finding a particle on a wave packet.@xcite this initial restricted version of born s rule , applied here to electromagnetic radiation for lrqm , is critical in its treatment of the squared modulus @xmath4 as a relative and not an absolute probability flux density .",
    "saxon reminds us of the fundamental utility of the unnormalized @xmath4 as the sufficient determining factor of relative positional probability.@xcite  the subsequent , commonly accepted interpretation of born s rule incorporates normalization of the wave function giving unit absolute probability for the squared modulus integrated over the entire wave packet .",
    "normalization is a seemingly natural and rational modification of the restricted version and was fully consistent with the then developing formulation of piqm .",
    "this modification provides piqm with a linkage of particle - like and wave - like properties that compactly expresses both in a wave function @xmath5 but necessitates the characteristic interpretations of duality and entanglement for particular phenomena .",
    "certainly , for an ordinary photon the resident particle - like energy quantum has unit absolute probability of existing somewhere on the wave packet and normalization of the lrqm wave function @xmath3 in this case serves as a mathematical convenience in equating a unit - valued expression of energy conservation and a unit - valued probability represented by the integrated square modulus @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , in lrqm an initial normalization of @xmath3 must not be arbitrarily re - applied to an evolving wave function since processes such as interference occurring during that evolution may create or annihilate wave amplitude .",
    "effectively , lrqm separates a purely wave - like @xmath3 from a piqm @xmath5 and provides that @xmath3 with the degree of freedom to scale independent of resident quanta .",
    "we continue to use the term probability  here in lrqm bearing in mind that its usage is potentially misleading since that term suggests equivalence to a mathematical absolute probability , an equivalence manifested in piqm as duality .",
    "classically , the probability flux density @xmath4 is recognized as a wave intensity . for a discrete photon incident on an idealized beam splitter",
    ", the wave intensity fractionally divides onto the output channels in accordance with the transmission and reflection coefficients of the beam splitter . in the present example",
    ", we choose for convenience a 50:50 beam splitter for which the output packets are similar to the incident packet but with half the intensity giving each a relative probability of @xmath6 when the incident packet is assigned @xmath7 .",
    "then , when the energy quantum on that incident packet reaches the beam splitter , the quantum randomly transfers onto either of the emerging outgoing @xmath6 packets with equal probability . in the discrete regime",
    "this implies that for each incident photon , one of the outputs is an empty  wave that is totally depleted  in energy quanta relative to its wave packet probability @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , the other output is enriched  in energy quanta relative to probability in the regard that the single energy quantum resides on a wave packet that is now @xmath6 instead of @xmath7 .",
    "the prediction of empty waves in the discrete regime has been the subject of many investigations seeking to differentially test local realism and piqm as in a series of papers by croca et al .",
    "@xcite as well as in numerous others such as refs . @xcite .",
    "these investigations , frequently using a beam splitter to generate an empty wave , are necessarily restricted to the very weak wave intensities associated with discrete photon beams .    as we move from the discrete photon regime to a multiple photon beam in the continuous wave ( cw ) regime , the relevant total wave function",
    "is conventionally constructed from a summation over amplitudes of the constituent wave packets .",
    "( our particular interest here is mono - energetic coherent beams . )",
    "the wave function , which we continue to identify as @xmath3 , is used to express the beam s intensity @xmath4 , again a probability flux density .",
    "integration of @xmath4 over some selected beam segment gives an inclusive probability @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding inclusive quanta in that segment have a total energy @xmath9 .",
    "we can set @xmath10 in arbitrary units for the beam segment .",
    "when this beam is incident on a 50:50 beam splitter , we again have @xmath6 on each of the output channels .",
    "however , random statistical distribution of the inclusive quanta onto the output channels yields @xmath9 vanishingly close to @xmath11 on both channels as the inclusive number of quanta becomes large .",
    "an immediate consequence of the cw regime for the beam splitter is that testability for empty waves is no longer feasible .",
    "then , although local realism does not expressly prohibit empty waves in the cw regime , the inherent statistical distribution process is intuitively expected to restrict all mechanisms for generating empty waves to the discrete regime where conclusive experimental verification is marginalized .    a mechanism that alters the proportionality of probability and energy on a photon beam in the cw regime is seemingly as improbable as maxwell s hypothesized mechanism for selectively sorting particles based upon their respective kinetic energies.@xcite    in section iii .",
    "we present the theoretical basis for a mechanism that , from the perspective of lrqm , is predicted to selectively alter the proportionality of probability and energy . in section iv .",
    "we report on the experimental realization of this phenomenon .",
    "the theoretical basis developed here for the lrqm wave - like component is substantially classical .",
    "this basis does not obviate the underlying quantum mechanical formalism such as the wave function associated with quantization of the electromagnetic field , but it does modify the scaling of a separable , purely wave - like component @xmath3 . as a consequence , the piqm duality proportionality of wave probability ( based on that @xmath3 ) and particle - like energy quantum",
    "is potentially violated .",
    "a mechanism for this duality violation , trivially but transiently realized in the discrete regime for lrqm , is however not immediately obvious in the cw regime . before beginning the examination of mechanisms that achieve this duality modulation  in the cw regime , we return to the example of a beam splitter once again in order to develop some basic operational definitions and principles relevant to lrqm .",
    "when a photon is incident on a beam splitter , the transfer process of the energy quantum to one of the relative probability wave packets on the output channels is itself of fundamental significance to lrqm . for illustrative purposes we again",
    "choose a 50:50 beam splitter .",
    "the quantum on an incident @xmath7 wave packet enters a zone at the face of the beam splitter where the quantum randomly transfers onto one of the two emergent @xmath6 output wave packets . unlike their treatment in piqm",
    ", those output wave packets remain as real entities at that probability value on both output channels and one packet does not undergo a collapse when a measurement is made on the other packet .    from the perspective of lrqm",
    ", the transfer at the beam splitter must be treated purely as that of the energy quantum .",
    "wave packet probability distribution is a non - quantized deterministic process at a device such as the beam splitter .",
    "the energy quantum arriving at the beam splitter surface randomly transfers onto one of the two emergent outputs causally mediated by their relative probability distribution consistent with born s rule.@xcite the wave structures of the two output packets are otherwise unaltered by the random presence or absence of the quantum on a particular output packet .",
    "( conversely , we will subsequently consider full photon transfers in other contexts that are consistent with both piqm and lrqm , i.e. duality is not violated .",
    "such transfers may involve scattering conditions that alter the trajectories of incident wave packets which are then accompanied by the proportionate energy quanta that had resided on the incident packets . )    in the interests of formalizing the proportionality between wave packet probability and energy quantum , we assign a value to their proportionality .",
    "each photon on a discrete beam is represented by an occupation  value @xmath12 defined as the ratio of the energy quantum and the total probability of its wave packet.@xcite as a baseline reference , we consider ordinary  photons that might be generated by common atomic emission processes .",
    "we assign @xmath13 to the energy quantum present on a wave packet of probability @xmath7 giving @xmath14 for these ordinary photons in arbitrary dimensionless units .",
    "if a discrete beam composed of such ordinary photons is incident on the 50:50 beam splitter , the output packets have @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "any @xmath17 signifies that the outgoing wave packet is reduced in energy relative to its associated wave packet probability and is referred to as depleted . in the extreme case of @xmath18 ,",
    "the wave packet is totally depleted and is appropriately referred to as an empty  wave.@xcite for @xmath19 , the wave packet is said to be enriched . in the present case of @xmath20 ,",
    "the single quantum resides on a @xmath6 wave packet compared to the @xmath7 wave packet of the incident photon .    in principle ,",
    "interference of either outgoing wave packet @xmath6 with an independent photon beam would result in the same visibility , unaffected by the presence or absence of the quantum on that outgoing wave packet .",
    "fundamentally , a measurement such as interference visibility assesses a beam s wave - like property whereas a direct detector measurement assesses a beam s particle - like ( energy quantum ) property .    as a matter of practical consideration , measurements of the wave - like property in the discrete regime , as provided for example by beam splitter outputs , are experimentally problematic .",
    "@xcite accordingly , we are motivated to seek a duality violation in the cw regime where experimental verification is significantly enhanced .    in the cw regime",
    ", the irradiance @xmath21 is used to describe the particle - like component of the photon beam where , conventionally , the formal units are those of an energy flux density .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding wave - like component is identified as the intensity @xmath22 which , in the lrqm context , is exclusive of the energy content of the wave . in analogy to our use of arbitrary units for the discrete beam , we are free to set unit values for @xmath21 and @xmath23 on an ordinary incident cw beam . any value specification of flux densities such as @xmath21 and @xmath23 implicitly refers to a sample point on the beam and typically that sample point gives the maxima of those values e.g. at the beam centroid for a gaussian cross - section .    with a specified @xmath21 and @xmath23 on an incident beam",
    "we have @xmath24 .",
    "equilibration of energy quanta ensures that the @xmath25 proportionality is maintained throughout the beam .",
    "then@xmath26 where the areal integration is over the beam s cross - section and the integrands are the respective coordinate - dependent values of @xmath21 and @xmath23 . an inclusive energy @xmath9 and probability @xmath8 on a selected beam segment may be selected by a choice of temporal integration limits spanning some selected @xmath27 .",
    "for that @xmath27 , we are free to assign arbitrary units to these quantities on the incident beam that give @xmath28 whereby @xmath29 . clearly , from the perspective of lrqm , @xmath29 is maintained on the outputs where , for a 50:50 beam splitter , @xmath6 and , because of random statistical equilibration , @xmath30 .    as a result of the common equivalence of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 ratios on any given beam in the cw regime",
    ", we will have frequent occasion to consider either the @xmath33 ( maximum flux density ) quantities or the @xmath34 ( integrated ) quantities as a matter of illustrative convenience . within the context of the present analysis ,",
    "when @xmath34 is the more convenient pair , the energy flux ( power ) @xmath35 and the probability flux @xmath36 would be equally convenient .",
    "however , we choose @xmath34 in the interests of continuity with our earlier discussion of discrete photons .",
    "[ ptb ]    dvfg-01.eps    as a reference baseline , an incident beam consisting of photons generated from conventional sources is identified as ordinary with @xmath29 by appropriate assignment of the arbitrary energy and probability units .",
    "then the identifications of a cw beam as depleted or enriched are equivalently expressed by a respective @xmath17 or @xmath19 .",
    "we consider one last example involving the beam splitter , again 50:50 , in which both input channels have mutually coherent similar incident cw beams with intensities@xmath37 directed at the same point on the beam splitter and aligned so as to generate spatially coincident outputs as identified in fig .",
    "1 . in terms of the respective probabilities,@xmath38    in this current example , we continue the convention of designating beam quantities as incident  prior to interaction with a mechanism such as the beam splitter and output  for the prompt post - interaction manifestations of those quantities .",
    "these post - interaction output quantities then generate physically distinguishable quantities by interference that are designated as resultant . clearly",
    "this distinction of output and resultant designations was superfluous for the previous example of a single beam incident on a beam splitter .",
    "nevertheless , the utility of these designation distinctions will be evident when we consider duality modulating mechanisms .    in the present case ,",
    "the two incident beams intersect at a common point on a beam splitter . in fig .",
    "1 , the beams are laterally displaced from that common point in order to clearly depict the various output and resultant components emanating from that point . the amplitude moduli of the two reflected and the two transmitted output beams all have identical values@xmath39 with corresponding common intensity values@xmath40 or , equivalently in terms of respective probabilities,@xmath41 then for total probabilities in the transition from incidence to output , @xmath42 and probability is conserved in this incident@xmath43output transition .",
    "interference between the output beam amplitudes generates a pair of resultant beams with moduli dependent upon relative incident beam phasing . for our purposes here , we choose a particular phasing that gives amplitude moduli@xmath44 and@xmath45 with wave intensities@xmath46 and@xmath47    the output pair @xmath48 and @xmath49 is fully contiguous to its associated resultant @xmath50 , sharing a common origin at the beam splitter surface .",
    "the same applies to @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in both cases ,",
    "the members of either output pair are not separately experimentally measurable because interference of those members at their common origin promptly yields the experimentally measurable resultant wave .",
    "nevertheless , these considerations do not alter the continued reality of the output wave structures as they propagate contiguous to and are physically expressed by their respective resultant waves .",
    "integration yields the associated probabilities@xmath54 and@xmath55 where again , by appropriate choice of integration limits in arbitrary units , each has the same numerical value as that of the corresponding ( maximum ) wave intensity . with the total resultant probability@xmath56 we have conservation of probability in the output@xmath43resultant transition as well as in the incident@xmath43output transition .    for our particular choice of relative phase , @xmath57 is identically zero and @xmath58 .",
    "( that choice could also have been generalized as any relative phase but in anticipation of a relevant analogy in the next section , we choose a phase that gives a null value for one of the resultants . ) for @xmath57 , the constituent output waves continue to propagate as real but @xmath59 out - of - phase entities with a null sum .",
    "similarly , the constituent in - phase output waves generate a resultant @xmath58 that exceeds the sum of those output probabilities,@xmath60",
    "these observations are very elementary and would have been superfluous for the absolute mathematical probabilities of piqm .",
    "however , in the context of the real wave structures of lrqm , there is a significant process that should be emphasized here .",
    "interference , which nullifies the resultant of the two output probabilities on one channel , fortuitously amplifies  the output sum probability on the other channel to precisely compensate for that nullification and conserve probability in the output@xmath43resultant transition .",
    "the criticality of interference in conserving probability on these real wave structures suggests that a disruption of this precise compensation by interference may provide a mechanism for duality modulation",
    ".    then with @xmath25 s computed from either the @xmath33 or the @xmath34 pairs,@xmath61 respectively for the horizontal , vertical , and total resultant beam occupation values .",
    "these lrqm values are fully consistent with piqm duality .",
    "the various beam splitter phenomena treated here from the perspective of lrqm are , nevertheless , almost universally represented in the literature by a formalism consistent with piqm .",
    "however , in the next section we analogously apply lrqm to particular grating systems and demonstrate the basis for a duality - violating mechanism that is not representable by piqm .",
    "the general mechanism we consider here for modulating the ratio @xmath25 of beam energy and probability is a conventional transmissive picket - fence  grating consisting of a regular linear array of parallel opaque bands with a periodicity @xmath62 forming intervening slits of width @xmath63 .",
    "typically for optical gratings of this type , the opaque bands are thin metallic depositions on one side of a transmissive substrate . in our analysis",
    ", we treat that side as the exit face of the transmission grating with an incident beam normal to the opposite face of the substrate .",
    "as we proceed , we must take care to adequately quantify the real entities of energy and probability as incidence@xmath43output and output@xmath64resultant transitions occur .",
    "ordinary incident beams generated by conventional sources may be assigned@xmath65 in arbitrary units which gives an incident beam occupation value@xmath66 as a calculation convenience .",
    "the quantification at each transition requires either a verification that @xmath25 is maintained or an individual assessment of energy and of probability in that transition .    for any individual slit ,",
    "the output energy quanta and the output probability necessarily remain in constant proportionality relative to that of the incident beam since that single slit equally samples both quantities from the incident beam .",
    "indeed , a deviation from this proportionality would constitute a violation of piqm duality for a mechanism consisting of a single slit .",
    "accordingly , from the perspective of lrqm as well as piqm , an incident @xmath67 is maintained on the output of any single slit as well as collectively over all slit outputs , i.e. @xmath68 . see fig .",
    "moreover , with an incident beam of some particular gaussian diameter @xmath69 , the ( transmitted ) output probability and output energy quanta are both invariant as @xmath63 and @xmath62 are proportionately varied since@xmath70 presents a constant fractional cross section for transferring probability and energy quanta from incidence to output , i.e. the grating s transmission factor . essentially ,",
    "proportionate increases in @xmath63 and @xmath62 results in increases for individual slit outputs of both probability and    [ ptb ]    dvfg-02.eps    energy quanta but , concurrently , the number of incident - irradiated slits yielding those outputs is proportionately decreased .",
    "then , beginning with an ordinary incident beam , equal sampling gives the output quantities@xmath71 where both are specific to some particular value of @xmath72 but independent of @xmath63 and , as a matter of convenience , in arbitrary units we assign unit value to both in eq .",
    "the output occupation value @xmath73 is constructed from the ratio of @xmath74 and @xmath75 but , because of equal sampling for those quantities for any @xmath76 , their ratios@xmath77 are independent of @xmath76 .",
    "the transition to the resultant diffraction orders requires that we examine quantities such as wave amplitude and intensity for the emergent output diffraction envelopes . in this regard",
    "it is most expedient to begin with the classic phasor construction for the output wave intensity from a single slit @xmath78 from kirchhoff diffraction theory in the fraunhofer approximation@xmath79",
    "where@xmath80 for a wavelength @xmath81 .",
    "( 22 ) above must be used with care as we proceed since the intensity @xmath82 is expressed in @xmath83-space  rather than over the physical @xmath84 angular space azimuthal to the slit . moreover",
    ", this phasor construction relates entirely to the slit output intensity distribution , giving @xmath82 relative to a centroid value @xmath85 .",
    "effectively then , the eq . ( 22 ) intensity is unscaled with respect to the incident beam intensity attenuation in transiting the slit of width @xmath63 .",
    "we will return to this consideration below and show that it is readily resolved . in the meantime , as a matter of convenience , we choose arbitrary units with @xmath86 .",
    "our present investigation also does not consider slits in the sub - wavelength range @xmath87 .",
    "nevertheless , we will have need to consider slit widths in the neighborhood of @xmath88 where classic references such as that of elmore and heald caution us that the kirchhoff diffraction theory is less accurate , and it is expected that the single - slit diffraction factor will no longer give a good description of the envelope.@xcite this caution is quite correct . however",
    ", we will return to this point and show that such deviations are not a factor in the essential criteria for duality violation .",
    "accordingly , we proceed here with the use of the @xmath89 envelope in the interests of illustrating duality violation using an explicit analytical function for that envelope and , later in this section , we show that the essential criteria for duality violation are well satisfied in the present case and identify the general requirements of an arbitrary envelope in meeting these criteria .    from eq .",

    "<S> diffraction orders in the continuous wave regime generated by a ronchi transmission grating in a standard threshold configuration are shown theoretically to violate quantum duality for a locally real representation . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon superficially resembles rayleigh anomalies but is notably distinguished from those anomalies by a prediction of probability non - conservation . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction is experimentally tested with a 633 nm laser beam at normal incidence on gratings giving that threshold condition for the @xmath0 order pair . </S>",
    "<S> transient intersection of the @xmath1 order with an independent 633 nm laser beam demonstrates a duality - violating probability non - conservation in good agreement with the theoretical prediction . </S>"
