    "<S> in the case of ferromagnetic coupling between nearest neighbours and neglecting opposite neighbours interaction across the long diagonal axis of the rhombus , the @xmath0 hamiltonian is minimised at @xmath99 when all polariton sites lock in phase , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> 4(a , b , c ) are shown in the order of the increasing distance between the sites , therefore , the anti - ferromagnetic states of figs . 4(a ) and 4(c ) belong to two different bands of anti - ferromagnetic regions separated by a ferromagnetic band ( the alternating anti - ferromagnetic / ferromagnetic couplings bands are shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> random polariton graph : _ beyond the minimization of the @xmath0 hamiltonian of polariton condensates on regular lattices we test our platform on a disordered polariton graph of five vertices . </S>",
    "<S> we took a graph initially consisting of three equidistant triangular unit cells for a lattice constant that leads to anti - ferromagnetic coupling , but with one spot breaking the symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved experimentally by slightly displacing one spot on the graph . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5 shows the spin configuration , experimental results of the real - space tomography of the photoluminescence intensity at the energy of the condensate at condensation threshold and numerical simulations that correspond to this graph . </S>",
    "<S> for the symmetric configuration of three equidistant triangular cells and considering only nearest neighbours interactions , the @xmath0 hamiltonian is minimised at @xmath102 with an alternating winding around each cell slightly deviating from @xmath98 difference reported for a single equilateral triangle ( see supp . mat . for details ) . breaking the symmetry leads to a different phase distribution , while maintaining the winding around each cell . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the fringes on the experimental image ( with the different rows of local maxima along the two long diagonals ) shows that the symmetry is explicitly broken .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we propose polariton graphs as an analog platform for minimizing the @xmath0 hamiltonian and experimentally demonstrate its experimental implementation for simple building blocks of lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that the search for the global ground state of a polariton graph is equivalent to the minimisation of the @xmath0 hamiltonian @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> polariton graphs offer the scalability of optical lattices , together with the potential to study disordered systems , and to control both the sign and the strength of the coupling for each edge independently . </S>",
    "<S> similar to networks of time - multiplexed opos , phase transitions in polariton graphs occur at the global ground state . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , polariton graphs offer the potential to quench either all or individual vertices on variable time scales and study the complex relaxation dynamics . with the recent advances in the field of polariton condensates , such as room temperature operation @xcite and condensation under electrical pumping @xcite , </S>",
