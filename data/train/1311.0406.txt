    "quantum rings structures not only provides an excellent physics playground to study coherent transport and electronic interference phenomena , but they also constitutes very appealing systems towards the realization of novel spintronic devices .",
    "the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect and its relativistic counterpart , the aharonov - casher(ac ) effect , are just two of these quantum interference phenomena that may appear simultaneously in semiconductor quantum rings . they manifest as an oscillatory behavior of the conductance of the quantum ring , either as a magnetic flux is varied ( ab - effect ) , or as a function of the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) strength ( ac - effect ) in the semiconductor ring . in the ab - effect , is the accumulated phase acquired by two electronic waves traveling coherently around a close loop in opposite directions that leads to magnetoconductance oscillations .",
    "in contrast , in the ac - effect , is the precessing intrinsic magnetic moment ( spin ) of the electrons winding the ring , that acquires a phase change due to a gate - voltage tunable soi . as a result , periodic conductance oscillations can be observed as a perpendicular external electric field is varied .",
    "the ab - effect was first observed by webb _",
    "et al . _ in metallic rings.a few years later cimmino _ et al . _",
    "performed experiments using neutron ( spin 1/2 ) beams following a closed path observing signals of the ac - oscillation phenomena .",
    "the ac - phase oscillations has been observed also in a hgte / hgcdte based single quantum ring and in small arrays of mesoscopic ingaas / inalas based rings which exhibit strong rashba - soi .",
    "additional phase effects concern the berry ( geometric ) phase , acquired by a quantal particle traveling around a circuit in inhomogeneous effective magnetic fields . berry phase signatures in the conductance has been studied in one- and two - dimensional ( 2d ) rings with rashba soi .",
    "more recently the ac - phase oscillations were measured in an array of gated ingaas / inalas - based quantum rings as a function of the rashba soi strength and of the rings radius .",
    "interestingly , the authors were also able to observe a topological ( geometric ) spin phase , that together with its dynamical phase , contributes to the overall time - reversal ac - phase change .",
    "micron - sized and nanoscale semiconductor quantum rings fabricated on two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) are the base of several spintronics proposal devices , ranging from spin - interference devices that modulate the output electric current , spin - filters , and quantum splitters , to mention a few .    in this work",
    "we propose a spin - interference device setup composed by a semiconductor quantum - ring ( qr ) with rashba - soi at the center of the structure , and connected to a source and drain of electrons via quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , the ring junctions ( here characterized by qpcs ) are allocated symmetrically , just at the qr periphery .",
    "additionally a third qpc is located in one of the arms of the qr device ( fig.[qr - device ] ) .",
    "most notably , all qpcs are presumed to be 2d and independently tuned with in - plane electrical gates .",
    "by doing so , we additionally manage to overcome several disadvantages of former related studies that relied on a free parameter @xmath1 to characterize the qr - coupling with the leads .    as far we know ,",
    "a study of the role of qpcs with variable electrostatic width , allocated at the inlet and outlet of a quantum ring ( qr ) , has not been reported before , neither experimentally , nor theoretically .",
    "same applies for the case of a qr - device with an inserted qpc with tunable width at one of the arms of the qr .",
    "hence just the proposal itself constitutes an interesting idea worth of a detailed study .",
    "is very important to remark also that this setup offers the possibility of tuning the spin - interference phenomenon in the qr just by controlling electrostatically the effective width of the qpcs , in the presence or not , of an external magnetic fields as we shall see later .",
    "here we study theoretically the coherent electronic quantum transport and the spin interference in the described qr - based setup above in the presence of rashba - soi , and investigate the role of the lead - to - ring junctions via qpcs together with an upper - arm qpc .",
    "the backscattering and tunneling through the lead - to - ring junctions were modeled by two - dimensional saddle point potentials describing here the qpc electrical confinement .",
    "following bttikerand vasilopoulus _",
    "an appropriate scattering matrix @xmath0 formalism is established . invoking then time - reversal invariance and unitarily relations of the @xmath0 matrix we are able to derive the relevant tunneling quantities through the whole structure .",
    "exact formulas for the quantum conductance of the qr - device are obtained .",
    "we find that two - probe conductance oscillations of the ring are rather sensitive to the confinement strength at the qpcs , as well as with the applied magnetic field and the spin orbit interaction intensity .",
    "we predict distinctive variations of the two - probe qr - conductance oscillations which can be used to modulate the aharonov - bohm and aharonov - casher phases by applying gate voltages .",
    "it is shown as well that is possible to control interference pattern in the qr to a large extend by varying the lead - to - ring topological parameters .",
    "our results might be therefore of relevance for promising spin - orbitonics devices based in quantum interference mechanisms .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : device ]",
    "we introduce the quantum ring device under study as well as the qpc model employed . in section [ qr - hamiltonian ]",
    "we analyze the bare quantum ring hamiltonian and its eigensolutions . the @xmath0-matrix formalism applied to the whole qr - device",
    "is presented in section [ sec : scattering ] . the main formulas of this paper are derived in this section . in section [ sec : results ] we discuss in detail several illustrative numerical simulations of the spin interference properties occurring in the proposed device configuration .",
    "a summary is provided in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "consider a quantum ring of radius @xmath2 and width @xmath3 defined electrostatically on a semiconductor 2deg through some radial confining potential .",
    "it can be produced _",
    "e.g. _ by applying a gate voltage to a metallic ring - shape structure deposited on top of the semiconductor heterostructure containing the 2deg .",
    "fig.[qr - device ] shows a sketch of a top view of the whole device configuration envisioned here .",
    "we assume that the two - probe device consist of the qr at the center of the structure connected to two leads by qpcs conforming the lead - to - ring junctions ( interfaces ) .",
    "the leads are considered in ohmic contact with a qpc / qr@xmath4/qpc structure , where qr@xmath4 denotes here that an additional qpc has been inserted in the upper arm of the qr .",
    "the effective widths ( transparency ) of all qpcs are assumed to be gate - tunable in an independent manner .",
    "theoretically , the role of the electron scattering at the junctions lead - to - ring on the aharonov - bohm oscillations was first addressed by bttiker by studying metallic qrs within the @xmath0-matrix formalism .",
    "the approach has been employed subsequently to model transport in semiconductor ab - rings as well as ac spin - orbit effects . despite its versatility ,",
    "the approach relies on a free parameter ( @xmath1 in ref . [ ] ) used to characterize the qr - coupling with the leads , and modeled as a point - like scatterers .",
    "the free parameter @xmath1 represents the transmission amplitude from one lead to the ab ring , or vice versa , and can take values in the range @xmath5 ; where perfect reflection means @xmath6 , while perfect transmission entails @xmath7 .",
    "the introduction of this parameter was a first effort to describe the possible band mismatch between the leads and the conducting ab - qr .",
    "furthermore the model introduces a second caveat , which arises when a third scatterer is considered in one of the arms of the qr .",
    "it predicts the counterintuitive result of a finite emerging current flux form the qr ( non - zero electron transmission probability ) in the limit case of a zero dynamic phase change ( @xmath8 ) , _ i.e. _ eventhough the incident fermi energy @xmath9 is set to zero and there is no bias voltage present .",
    "clearly a special care have to be exercised when modeling the lead - to - ring for the case of semiconductor junctions .    here",
    "we propose to replace the point - like scatterers that model the lead - to - ring junctions by two - dimensional quantum point contacts instead . by doing so ,",
    "the dependence on a free parameter is naturally avoided in the model , and very important , the proposed geometry give us additional degrees of freedom to manipulate the conductance and spin interference in the qpc / qr@xmath4/qpc device .    as we will show later",
    ", the conductance quantum oscillations in the qpc / qr@xmath4/qpc device can be related not only to magnetic flux and the soi effects as in earlier reports , but also to the confinement strength of the qpcs .",
    "indeed , this new feature ( tunability of the qpcs ) we have considered in the qr device allows means to control the spin - conductance oscillations of the output current , and in turn , can be used to modulate the aharonov - bohm and aharanov - casher phases solely by applying gate voltages .",
    "furthermore , it is predicted that the insertion of tunable qpcs in the qr leads to new and distinguishable physical response of the conductance oscillations of the qr , which are in principle , measurable at low temperatures .",
    "hence a rich variety of interference phenomena arises which may be also of interest for potential applications .",
    "the lead - to - ring junctions of the device are assumed to form a narrow quantum constriction , _",
    "i.e. _ , a qpc .",
    "each qpc ( including the one at the upper arm of the qr ) are modeled through saddle point electrostatic potentials whose confinement are in principle tunable by external gates . to a good approximation",
    "the qpc can be represented through a purely quadratic two - dimensional potential , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the potential energy at the saddle point , @xmath12 is the effective mass of the conduction electrons , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are the characteristic longitudinal and the transversal energy confinements , respectively .",
    "the reference energy @xmath11 as well as the lateral @xmath15-@xmath16 confinement , can be adjusted in the actual experiments through electrical gates in an independent way .",
    "remarkably , as deduced by fertig and halpering , in the presence of a magnetic flux - due to a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath17 - the electron transmission amplitude of the two - dimensional potential ( [ sp - potential ] ) can be described solely , by a dimensionless parameter @xmath18 , which is a function of all the relevant energies characterizing the qpc .",
    "namely @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the quantum transmission amplitude reads , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gamma function .",
    "the transmission probability of the qpc , @xmath23 simplifies to @xmath24 which satisfies @xmath25 , and thus @xmath26 will be the reflection probability that an incoming electron with unitary amplitude has been elastically backscatter from the qpc . in the limit @xmath27",
    ", we have for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , while for @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 . explicitly , the parameterized energy is given by @xmath32 , and give us a measure of the energy of the semi - classical guiding - center motion @xmath33 relative to @xmath11 .",
    "here @xmath34 , with @xmath35 ( non - negative integer ) denoting the quantum index for the _ quasi_-landau levels .",
    "the energies @xmath36 with @xmath37 are given explicitly by @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "since in the limit of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , then @xmath42 is called the effective oscillator frequency . semi - classically , a charge carrier entering a region crossed by a magnetic field @xmath17 , perpendicular to 2deg and to the qr plane , will describe a circular motion with cyclotron frequency @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear that the intensity of the scattering magnitudes ( [ t - fertig ] ) is directly bonded to @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , one can distinguish two different scenarios for the electronic transport , namely : ( _ i _ ) quantum tunneling for @xmath45 , and ( _ ii _ ) quantum transmission following quasi - classical motion around the saddle - point potential for @xmath46 . here",
    "we will be interested in the latter case , with the cyclotron frequency written in terms of the magnetic flux penetrating the qr as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the magnetic flux .",
    "before we go into the details of the scattering process in the qpc / qr@xmath4/qpc device , it is convenient to revisit first the hamiltonian model used to model the ab - ac - qr without scatterer ( qpcs ) and in presence of rashba - soi .",
    "the single - electron two - dimensional hamiltonian for a semiconductor quantum ring in the presence of rashba - soi ( without scatterers ) and in the absence of a magnetic field is first described in polar cylindrical coordinates .",
    "it reads @xmath49 where the purely radial term is given by @xmath50 whereas the angular dependence as well as the rashba - soi term , is contained in @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the rashba - soi parameter strength , the matrix vector @xmath53 , being @xmath54 , the usual spin pauli matrices , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are unitary vectors along the radial and azimuthal direction , respectively .",
    "following meijer _",
    "et al . _ , in the limit of a narrow ring ( _ i.e. _ strong radial confinement ) , the associated confining energy in the radial direction becomes ( typically ) much larger than the characteristic soi and kinetic energies of the circling electrons around the ring .",
    "thus @xmath57 can be treated perturbatively by introducing an appropriate model potential @xmath58 by solving first the purely radial term @xmath59 .",
    "an effective one - dimensional ( 1d ) hamiltonian depending only on the azimuthal angle @xmath60 can be obtained by taking the expectation value of eq . with the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath61 in the lowest radial mode , @xmath62 .",
    "the effective 1d hamiltonian takes the form @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "then to first order , we can rewrite ( [ h2d ] ) as @xmath65 as a separable in @xmath66 and @xmath60 hamiltonian to deal with .    up to this point",
    "we have not considered yet the effect of an external magnetic field ( magnetic flux ) across the path of the winding electrons in the ring .",
    "this is done by introducing the usual _ minimal coupling _",
    "substitution of the momentum operator , @xmath67 .",
    "the vector potential can be conveniently chosen to be tangential to the qr for a magnetic field @xmath17 perpendicular to the plane of the ring by using @xmath68 . as a result",
    "the moving electrons flowing around the ring will experiment a magnetic flux given by @xmath69 .",
    "this is formally equivalent to the replacement @xmath70 in eq . , where @xmath71 is the the magnetic flux quanta .",
    "the latter gives rise to the well known ab phase ( @xmath72 ) acquired by the electrons moving in the close path of the quantum in the presence of a magnetic flux . as a consequence",
    "the physical information of ab phase can be carried out directly in the overall phase of the eigenstates of the soi 1d - hamiltonian .",
    "note that the magnetic field may or not penetrate the qr . here",
    "we are interested in the relatively weak magnetic field regime , or either the case in which just the magnetic flux penetrates the ab - ac - qr ( see fig.[eigenwave]a ) , but not the field itself , and therefore the zeeman effect can be safely neglected in the full description .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) the diagram sketches the clockwise and anti - clockwise propagation for the two spin - resolved eigenstates , defined in ( [ eigenstates - plus ] ) and ( [ eigenstates - minus ] ) within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "( b ) spin orientation @xmath73 of the electrons winding the ring .",

    "then it follows that a particular set of eigensolutions of the system @xmath78 per spin orientation and clockwise / anticlockwise @xmath79 propagation of the electrons can be written as @xmath80 @xmath81 with normalized eigenspinors given by @xmath82 , \\;\\ ;    |-\\rangle =       \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\eta^2}}\\left [      \\begin{array}{c }        1 \\\\",

    "are recasted as , @xmath90 the right hand side holds as long @xmath91 , which is true for typical 2deg embedded in iii - v semiconductor quantum wells .",
    "let us now consider a full cycle of the wave functions around the qr under a penetrating magnetic flux .",
    "apart from the usual aharonov - bohm phase @xmath92 discussed above due to the presence of the soi , a topological berry phase @xmath93 have to be added to the spin - dependent wave functions .",
    "the berry phase arises as a consequence of the phase factor acquired by the electron spin at the end of its loop around the qr as it adiabatically rotates ( precesses ) trying to follow the effective magnetic field @xmath94 due to soi ( see fig.[eigenwave]c,[eigenwave]d ) .",
    "that is , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and we have followed the sign convention in the berry phase of ref .. the berry phase is calculated as half of the material angle subtended by the effective magnetic field , such that the angle @xmath97 between the @xmath75-direction and the cone formed by the precessing spin satisfies @xmath98    in the adiabatic approximation @xmath99 ( _ i.e. _ in the limit of vanishing spin - geometric phase ) the parameter @xmath100 and the spin orientation of the electrons is described by the vector @xmath101 .",
    "that is , the electron spin is oriented in - plane , radially toward or from the ring center of the qr , see fig.[eigenwave](b ) .",
    "since the rashba spin - orbit induced effective magnetic field is given by @xmath102 ) , with @xmath103 the wave vector of the moving electrons in an external electric field @xmath104 , then the spin - orientation is directed either , parallel or antiparallel to the effective magnetic field . for this case",
    "the overall berry phase is just a constant and reduces to @xmath105    clearly these results above holds as long there are no scatterer points along the path of the electrons in the qr .",
    "the role of the qpcs on the scattering process , together with the phases involved are the focus of the following discussion .",
    "as depicted in fig.[qr - device ] at the junction of each lead with the qr is a qpc@xmath106 , where @xmath107 refers to the left(right ) quantum point contact .",
    "additionally a third scatterer ( qpc@xmath108 ) is located at the upper arm of the qr .",
    "now , it is important to mention that spin scattering mechanisms such as the spin - orbit mediated coupling with ( piezoelectric ) phonons , are believed to be the main source of spin - fliping in qrs as well as in quantum dots .",
    "however it is also well known theoretically and experimentally , that the associated relaxation times in these systems are extremelly large , ranging from milliseconds up to few seconds , see refs.[37],[38 ] and [ 39 ] .",
    "this times are longer than the associated momentum and collision times in such ballistic systems and will not play a role here .",
    "therefore any spin - flip processes at the qpcs will be subsequently neglected in this work . also , without loss of generality , it will be assumed that the electron spin is preserved along the qr path .",
    "the spin states can be treated then as two independent channels of propagation . consequently , for each spin channel we have three outgoing electronic waves with amplitudes @xmath109 , and accordingly , three incoming waves with amplitudes @xmath110 .",
    "similarly , for the qpc@xmath108 we have two ingoing and two outgoing electronic waves with amplitudes @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively ( see fig.[ampliwave ] ) .",
    "it is worth recalling that in the adiabatic approximation , the presence of the rashba - soi in the qr do not actually intermixes the electron spins .",
    "the rashba - soi enters here solely a source of an ac phase of the traveling waves , as has been previously discussed .",
    "the ac phase adds up then to the ab and berry phase acquired by the electrons waves in their round trip along the qr .",
    "we chose the convention that clockwise - oriented waves give rise to positive phases , whereas the waves moving in the opposite direction accumulates a negative phase .    each lead - to - ring junction",
    "( the scattering of an electron with spin @xmath113 at qpc@xmath114 ) is described by a ( @xmath115 ) scattering matrix @xmath116 . under the presence of a magnetic flux",
    "@xmath117 penetrating the qr , time reversal invariance ( tri ) is satisfied , leading to the known onsager - casimir relations for the scattering matrix elements @xmath118 , where @xmath119 are the outgoing / ingoing channel , respectively . in the absence of the magnetic flux it reduces to the expected reciprocal relations ( symmetricity of @xmath116 ) .",
    "this physically implies that the symmetric injection - ejection process of electrons at each junction ( qpc ) of the qr device is withhold .",
    "in addition , unitarity of @xmath116 ensures current conservation at both , left and right qpcs .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath120 as required for outgoing and ingoing waves amplitudes from standard scattering formalism . given that flux conservation together with tri , guarantee @xmath121 which entails the symmetricity property @xmath116 , allow thus to propose @xmath122     ( color online ) diagram of the qr device attached to the leads .",

    "the parameters @xmath124 and @xmath125 are real coefficients to be determined . in ( [ sm12-sim ] ) the diagonal matrix elements , @xmath126 , represent the reflection amplitude of the @xmath127 channel , whereas the off - diagonal elements @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) characterizes the transmission amplitudes from channel @xmath130 to @xmath131 at a given junction . by demanding the unitary condition of the incident flux , _ i.e. _ @xmath132 , with @xmath133 the * ( @xmath134 ) * identity matrix , the parameters @xmath124 and @xmath125 in ( [ sm12-sim ] ) are readily obtained , yielding @xmath135 notice that and depend explicitly on the effective energy @xmath18 through the reflection probability of each qpc .",

    "<S> we introduce a spin - interference device that comprises a quantum ring ( qr ) with three embedded quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) and study theoretically its spin transport properties in the presence of rashba spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> two of the qpcs conform the lead - to - ring junctions while a third one is placed symmetrically in the upper arm of the qr . using an appropriate scattering model for the qpcs and the @xmath0-matrix scattering approach </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the role of the qpcs on the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) and aharonov - casher ( ac ) conductance oscillations of the qr - device . </S>",
    "<S> exact formulas are obtained for the spin - resolved conductances of the qr - device as a function of the confinement of the qpcs and the ab / ac phases . </S>",
    "<S> conditions for the appearance of resonances and anti - resonances in the spin - conductance are derived and discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we predict very distinctive variations of the qr - conductance oscillations not seen in previous qr proposals . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we find that the interference pattern in the qr can be manipulated to a large extend by varying electrically the lead - to - ring topological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be used to modulate the ab and ac phases by applying gate voltage only . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown also that the conductance oscillations exhibits a crossover to well - defined resonances as the lateral qpc confinement strength is increased , mapping the eigenenergies of the qr . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , unique features of the conductance arises by varying the aperture of the upper - arm qpc and the rashba spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our results may be of relevance for promising spin - orbitonics devices based in quantum interference mechanisms . </S>"
