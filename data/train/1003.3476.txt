    "among the flat  spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) class of blazars , 3c 454.3 ( @xmath4 , jackson & browne 1991 ) is one of the brightest and most variable sources . in april  may 2005 it underwent a dramatic optical outburst , reaching its historical maximum with @xmath5 ( villata et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this exceptional event triggered observations at x  ray energies with the _ integral _   ( pian et al .",
    "2006 ) and the _ swift _ satellites ( giommi et al .",
    "these detected the source up to 200  kev and in a brightened high energy state .",
    "this strong optical and hard x  ray activity was followed by a radio outburst with about one year delay ( villata et al .",
    "2007 ) . despite this extraordinary activity ,",
    "the lack of a @xmath3ray satellite at that time prevented us from concluding that this activity was due to a real increase of the jet power , since the integrated optical luminosity was of the same order of the @xmath3ray luminosity observed , years before , by the egret instrument onboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ satellite ( nandikotkur et al . 2007 ) .",
    "after the launch of _ agile _ , 3c 454.3 was seen to be very bright ( vercellone et al . 2007 ) and variable in the @xmath3ray band , being often the brightest @xmath3ray blazar in the sky ( vercellone et al .",
    "2010 ) , even if the simultaneous optical states were much fainter than during the 2005 flare .",

    "the magnetic field energy density scales as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "conversely , the radiation energy density @xmath9 produced by the broad line clouds scales as @xmath10 and is independent of @xmath6 as long as the dissipation region is within the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "even if the latter is most likely stratified , the contribution of the ly@xmath11 line to the blr luminosity is dominant , and we identify the size of the blr with the shell mostly emitting the ly@xmath11 photons . as a consequence , @xmath12 .",
    "even with a constant and dominating @xmath13 and a constant @xmath8 , we can have large variations of the optical flux by changing @xmath6 .",
    "these ideas were borne out in ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , immediately after the _ agile _ detection of a very bright @xmath3ray state accompanied by a moderate optical flux : the optical synchrotron flux can vary by a large amount even if the jet continues to carry the same power and always dissipates the same fraction of it .",
    "this assumes and implies , however , that the bulk of the electromagnetic output is in the high energy ( inverse compton ) component , that in this case should remain quasi  steady .",
    "instead the large outburst seen in december 2009 witnessed a dramatic increase of this component . in this case",
    "it is very likely that the power dissipated by the jet indeed increased , and it is likely that this is the consequence of an increase of total power carried by the jet .",
    "the luminosity reached in @xmath3rays exceeded @xmath14 erg s@xmath2 , a factor @xmath1530 larger than the egret luminosity , and also larger than the 2007 _ agile _ state .",
    "the goal of our present study is first to characterise the emission properties of 3c 454.3 during the november ",
    "december 2009 period , then to find the physical properties of the jet during the flare , and finally to compare those with the luminosity of the accretion disk .",
    "in fact , as we shall see , the power of the jet of 3c 454.3 in the first week of december 2009 likely surpassed the luminosity of the accretion disk .",

    "this opens new opportunities for the study of the mwl sed of this fsrq on short time scales , hopefully allowing deeper insight into the engine and the emission mechanism .    in this study",
    "we use lat spectra produced with data from only a few single days , selected within the period covered also by _ swift _ observations .",

    "it is of the order of 1 solar mass per year .",
    "we can compare this value with the accretion mass rate @xmath94 , that we can derive through @xmath95 .",
    "assuming @xmath96 , a disk luminosity @xmath97 erg s@xmath2 gives @xmath98 yr@xmath2 , about a factor 10 greater than @xmath93 .",
    "if the disk emits at a constant level , with a constant @xmath94 , we are forced to conclude that the link between the accretion rate and the jet power is not determined by @xmath94 , or , rather , that this is not the only important quantity in producing @xmath77 .",
    "for the ensemble of bright fsrqs detected by _",
    ", in fact , the disk luminosity does correlate with @xmath77 , even taking out the effect of a common redshift dependence in the two quantities ( see fig .",
    "[ ldlg ] and the discussion in ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ) . since the spin of the black hole of 3c 454.3 is constant , the likely quantity that modulates @xmath77 in nov ",
    "dec 2009 is the value of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the black hole horizon .",
    "if we assume that @xmath99 at the schwarzschild radius @xmath100 , the magnetic field must be @xmath101 in turn , we can check if the magnetic energy density @xmath102 can be equated to @xmath103 , the mass energy density of the accreting matter close to the schwarzschild radius .",
    "we can write @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the radial infalling velocity and @xmath106 is the total height of the disk at the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the above equation shows that if @xmath107 and @xmath108 , then @xmath109 , i.e. not an unreasonable value .",
    "we finally ask if 3c 454.3 is exceptional , or instead if there are other blazars reaching comparable values of @xmath13 and of @xmath110 . to answer",
    ", we can compare the flaring state of 3c 454.3 with all blazars of known redshift of the first 3months _",

    "( 2010 ) , as done in the top panel of fig .",
    "we alert the reader that in ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2010 ) we have considered the _ average _ @xmath3ray flux . had we considered the peak flux values there would be a few fsrqs of @xmath13 even greater than 3c 454.3 in high state ( one example is pks 1502 + 102 , abdo et al .",
    "in this respect we can conclude that 3c 454.3 is not the most extreme blazar : its unprecedented @xmath3ray flux is due to its relative vicinity in comparison to other fsrqs .",
    "the same occurs in the planes @xmath67@xmath91 and @xmath77@xmath91 ( mid and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ ldlg ] ) : there are other sources whose 3months averaged @xmath67 and @xmath77 are comparable to 3c 454.3 .",
    "the study of the strong @xmath3ray flare of 3c 454.3 , together with the good coverage at x  ray and optical  uv frequencies provided by _ swift _ allowed to investigate several issues about the physics of the jet of this blazar . in tavecchio",
    "( 2010 ) we analysed the behaviour of the 1.5 year _",
    "fermi_/lat light curve , finding episodes of very rapid variations , with time scales between 3 and 6 hours both during the rising and the decaying phases .",
    "this implies a very compact emitting region , suggesting that the dissipation zone is not too far from the black hole , and that cooling times are shorter than the variability time scales . in turn",
    "this suggests that the dissipation region lies within the blr , at about one thousand schwarzschild radii .",
    "we have revisited the estimate of the mass of the black hole of 3c 454.3 , finding a smaller value than found by gu , cao and jiang ( 2001 ) . since in our model",
    "the mass of the black hole sets the scales of the disk+jet system , a smaller mass helps to have a more compact emitting region , that can vary on shorter time scales .    the optical , x  ray and @xmath3ray fluxes correlate .",
    "this supports one  zone models .",
    "the @xmath3ray flux varies quadratically ( or even more ) with the optical and x  ray fluxes . by modelling the optical to @xmath3ray sed with a one ",
    "zone synchrotron+inverse compton leptonic model we can explain this behaviour if the magnetic field is slightly fainter when the overall jet luminosity is stronger .    the power that the jet spent to produce the peak @xmath3ray luminosity is of the same order than the accretion disk luminosity .",
    "although the jet power correlates with the accretion luminosity considering the ensemble of bright fsrqs detected by _",
    "fermi _ , 3c 454.3 probably varied its jet power while maintaining a constant accretion luminosity .",
    "this implies that the modulation of the jet power may not be due to variations of the accretion rate , but is probably due to variations of the magnetic field close to its black hole horizon .",
