    "the 3-satisfiability ( 3-sat ) problem is one of the paradigmatic np - complete problems  @xcite .",
    "an instance of the problem is a formula consisting of @xmath5 clauses , each of which is a set of three literals , i.e. boolean variables or their negations .",
    "the goal is to find a solution consisting of a satisfying truth assignment to the @xmath6 variables , such that each clause contains at least one literal evaluating to true , provided such an assignment exists . in a random 3-sat instance , the literals comprising each clause are chosen uniformly at random .    it was observed in  @xcite that random 3-sat instances change from being generically satisfiable to being generically unsatisfiable when the clauses - to - variables ratio @xmath7 exceeds a critical threshold @xmath3 .",
    "current numerical estimates  @xcite suggest that this satisfiability threshold is located approximately at @xmath8 . for a general introduction to aspects of the satisfiability problem see  @xcite .",
    "two questions are often asked in this context : how to solve random 3-sat instances effectively close to the threshold @xmath3 , and what can be said of the point at which various types of algorithms begin to falter .",
    "recently progress has been made by the `` survey propagation '' method  @xcite that essentially iterates a guess about the state of each variable , in the course of fixing an ever larger proportion of the variables to their `` best guess '' value .    in this article",
    "we investigate the performance of algorithms that try to find a solution by local moves , flipping the value of one variable at a time . when the variables to be flipped are chosen only from the unsatisfied ( unsat ) clauses , a local search algorithm is called _",
    "focusing_. a particularly well - known example of a focused local search algorithm for 3-sat is walksat  @xcite , which makes `` greedy '' and random flips with a fixed probability .",
    "many variants of this and other local search algorithms with different heuristics have been developed ; for a general overview of the techniques see  @xcite",
    ".    our main emphasis will be on a focused variant of the standard metropolis dynamics  @xcite of spin systems , which is also the base for the well - known simulated annealing optimization method .",
    "when applied to the 3-sat problem , we call this dynamics the focused metropolis search ( fms ) algorithm .",
    "we also consider the focused record - to - record travel ( frrt ) algorithm  @xcite , which imposes a history - dependent upper limit for the maximum energy allowed during its execution .",
    "the space of solutions to 3-sat instances slightly below @xmath3 is known to develop structure .",
    "physics - based methods from mean - field -like spin glasses imply through replica methods that the solutions become `` clustered '' , with a threshold of @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the clustering implies that if measured e.g.  by hamming distance the different solutions in the same cluster are close to each other .",
    "a possible consequence of this is the existence of cluster `` backbones '' , which means that in a cluster a certain fraction of the variables is fixed , while the others can be varied subject to some constraints .",
    "the stability of the replica ansatz becomes crucial for higher @xmath0 , and it has been suggested that this might become important at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the energy landscape in which the local algorithms move is however a finite - temperature version .",
    "the question is how close to @xmath3 one can get by moving around by local moves ( spin flips ) and focusing on the unsat clauses .",
    "our results concern the optimality of this strategy for various algorithms and @xmath0 .",
    "first , we demonstrate that walksat works in the `` critical '' region up to @xmath4 with the optimal noise parameter @xmath11 .",
    "then , we concentrate on the numerical performance of the fms method . in this case , the solution time is found to be linear in @xmath6 within a parameter window @xmath12 , where @xmath2 is essentially the metropolis temperature parameter .",
    "more precisely , we observe that within this window , the median and all other quantiles of the solution times normalised by @xmath6 seem to approach a constant value as @xmath6 increases . a stronger condition would be that the distributions of the solution times be concentrated in the sense that the ratio of the standard deviation and the average solution time decreases with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "while numerical studies of the distributions do not indicate heavy tails that would contradict this condition , we can of course not at present prove that this is rigorously true .",
    "the existence of the @xmath2 window implies that for too large @xmath2 the algorithm becomes entropic , while for too small @xmath2 it is too greedy , leading to freezing of degrees of freedom ( variables ) in that case .",
    "the _ optimal _",
    "@xmath13 , i.e.  that @xmath2 for which the solution time median is lowest , seems to increase with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "we have tried to extrapolate this behaviour towards @xmath3 and consider it possible that the algorithm works , in the median sense , linearly in @xmath6 all the way up to @xmath3 .",
    "this is in contradiction with some earlier conjectures .",
    "all in all we postulate a phase diagram for the fms algorithm based on two phase boundaries following from too little or too much greed . of this picture , one particular phase space point has been considered before  @xcite , since it happens to be the case that for @xmath14 the fms coincides the so called random walk method  @xcite , which is known to suffer from metastability at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we present as a comparison the walksat algorithm , list some of the known results concerning the random 3-sat problem , and test the walksat for varying @xmath16 and @xmath0 values . in section 3",
    "we go through the fms algorithm in detail , and present extensive numerical simulations with it .",
    "section 4 presents as a further comparison similar data for the frrt algorithm . in section 5",
    "we discuss how the notion of whitening  @xcite is related to the behaviour of fms with low @xmath2 .",
    "finally , section 6 finishes the paper with a summary .",
    "it is natural to view the satisfiability problem as a combinatorial optimisation task , where the goal for a given formula @xmath17 is to minimise the objective function @xmath18 the number of unsatisfied clauses in formula @xmath17 under truth assignment @xmath19 .",
    "the use of local search heuristics in this context was promoted e.g.  by selman et al .  in  @xcite and by gu in  @xcite .",
    "viewed as a spin glass model , @xmath20 can be taken to be the energy of the system .",
    "selman et al .  introduced in  @xcite the simple greedy gsat algorithm ,",
    "whereby at each step the variable to be flipped is determined by which flip yields the largest decrease in @xmath20 , or if no decrease is possible , then smallest increase .",
    "this method was improved in  @xcite by augmenting the simple greedy steps with an adjustable fraction @xmath16 of pure random walk moves , leading to the algorithm noisygsat .    ....",
    "walksat(f , p ) :    s = random initial truth assignment ;    while flips < max_flips do      if s satisfies f then output s & halt , else :      - pick a random unsatisfied clause c in f ;      - if some variables in c can be flipped without        breaking any presently satisfied clauses ,        then pick one such variable x at random ; else :      - with probability p , pick a variable x        in c at random ;      - with probability ( 1-p ) , pick some x in c        that breaks a minimal number of presently        satisfied clauses ;      - flip x. ....    in a different line of work , papadimitriou  @xcite introduced the very important idea of _ focusing _ the search to consider at each step only those variables that appear in the presently _ unsatisfied _ clauses . applying this modification to the noisygsat method",
    "leads to the walksat  @xcite algorithm ( figure  [ fig : wsat ] ) , which is the currently most popular local search method for satisfiability .    in  @xcite ,",
    "selman et al .  presented some comparisons among their new noisygsat and walksat algorithms , together with some other methods .",
    "these experiments were based on a somewhat unsystematic set of benchmark formulas with @xmath21 at @xmath22 , but nevertheless illustrated the significance of the focusing idea , since in the results reported , walksat outperformed noisygsat by several orders of magnitude .",
    "more recently , barthel et al .",
    "@xcite performed systematic numerical experiments with papadimitriou s original random walk method at @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "they also gave an analytical explanation for a transition in the dynamics of this algorithm at @xmath25 , already observed by parkes  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath26 , satisfying assignments are generically found in time that is linear in the number of variables , whereas when @xmath27 exponential time is required .",
    "( similar results were obtained by semerjian and monasson in  @xcite , though with smaller experiments ( @xmath28 ) . )",
    "the reason for this dynamical threshold phenomenon seems to be that at @xmath27 the search equilibrates at a nonzero energy level , and can only escape to a ground state through a large enough random fluctuation .",
    "a rate - equation analysis of the method  @xcite yields a very well matching approximation of @xmath29 .. ] see also  @xcite for further analyses of the random walk method on random 3-sat .",
    "walksat is more powerful than the simple random walk , because in it focusing is accompanied by other heuristics .",
    "however , it is known that the behaviour of walksat is quite sensitive to the choice of the noise parameter @xmath16 .",
    "e.g.parkes @xcite experimented with the algorithm using a noise value @xmath30 and concluded that with this setting the algorithm works in linear time at least up to @xmath31 .",
    "even this result is not the best possible , since it has been estimated  @xcite that for random 3-sat close to the satisfiability transition the optimal noise setting for walksat is @xmath32 .",
    "( actually our numerical experiments , reported below , suggest that the ideal value is closer to @xmath11 . )    these positive results notwithstanding , it has been generally conjectured ( e.g.  in  @xcite ) that no local search algorithm can work in linear time beyond the clustering transition at @xmath33 . in a series of recent experiments , however , aurell et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that with a proper choice of parameters , the median solution time of walksat remains linear in @xmath6 up to at least @xmath34 , the onset of 1-rsb symmetry breaking .",
    "our experiments , reported below , indicate that the median time in fact remains linear even beyond that , in line with our previous results  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : wsat_scan ] illustrates our experiments with the walksat algorithm ,   on randomly generated formulas of size @xmath35 , various values of the noise parameter @xmath16 , and values of @xmath0 starting from @xmath36 and increasing at increments of @xmath37 up to @xmath38 . for each @xmath39-combination ,",
    "21 formulas were generated , and for each of these the algorithm was run until either a satisfying solution was found or a time limit of @xmath40 flips was exceeded .",
    "figure  [ fig : wsat_scan](a ) shows the solution times @xmath41 , measured in number of flips normalised by @xmath6 , for each generated formula .",
    "figure  [ fig : wsat_scan](b ) gives the medians and quartiles of the data for each value of @xmath0 .",
    "as can be seen from the figures , for value @xmath42 of the noise parameter walksat finds satisfying assignments in roughly time linear in @xmath6 , with the coefficient of linearity increasing gradually with increasing @xmath0 , up to approximately @xmath43 beyond which the distribution of solution times for the algorithm diverges . for @xmath44 ,",
    "this linear regime extends further , up to at least @xmath45 , but for @xmath46 it seems to end already before @xmath47 . for the best value of @xmath16 we have been able to experimentally determine , @xmath48",
    ", the linear regime seems to extend up to even beyond @xmath49 .    to investigate the convergence of the solution time distributions",
    ", we tested the walksat algorithm with @xmath44 at @xmath34 and @xmath50 , in both cases with randomly generated sets of 100 formulas of sizes @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fig : wsat55_dist ] shows the cumulative distributions of the solution times normalised by @xmath6 achieved in these tests . as can be seen , for @xmath34",
    "the distributions are well - defined , with normalised medians and all other quantiles converging to a finite value for increasing @xmath6 . however , for @xmath50 , the distributions seem to diverge , with median values increasing with increasing @xmath6 .",
    ", the tests for @xmath35 and larger were not completed , because the solution times consistently overran the time limit of @xmath53 flips , and consequently the test runs were exceedingly long yet uninformative . ]    in order to estimate the optimal value of the walksat noise parameter , i.e.  that value of @xmath16 for which the linear time regime extends to the biggest value of @xmath0 , we generated test sets consisting of 21 formulas , each of size @xmath35 , for @xmath0 values ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath38 at increments of @xmath55 , and for each @xmath0 for @xmath16 values ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 at increments of @xmath58 .",
    "walksat was then run on each resulting @xmath59 test set ; the medians and quartiles of the observed solution time distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : wsatmin_med ] .",
    "the data suggest that the optimal value of the noise parameter is approximately @xmath48 .",
    "figure  [ fig : wsat57_dist ] shows the empirical solution time distributions at @xmath50 for @xmath48 .",
    "in contrast to figure  [ fig : wsat55_dist](b ) , now the quantiles seem again to converge to a finite value for increasing @xmath6 , albeit more slowly than in the case of the simpler @xmath34 formulas presented in figure  [ fig : wsat55_dist](a ) .",
    "from an analytical point of view , the walksat algorithm is rather complicated , with its interleaved greedy and randomised moves .",
    "thus , it is of interest to investigate the behaviour of the simpler algorithm obtained by imposing the focusing heuristic on a basic metropolis dynamics  @xcite .    ....",

    "note , however , that detailed balance does not hold with focusing . )",

    "the results , shown in figure  [ fig : fms036_420 ] , suggest that even for this high value of @xmath0 , the fms solution times are linear in @xmath6 , with all quantiles converging to a finite value as @xmath6 increases",
    ".    the linearity of fms can fail due to the formation of heavy tails .",
    "this , with a given @xmath0 and a not too optimal , large @xmath2 would imply that the solution time @xmath41 has at least a divergent mean ( first moment ) and perhaps a divergent median as well .",
    "this can be deliberated upon by considering the `` scaling ansatz '' @xmath74 where @xmath75 for @xmath76 small , and @xmath77 rapidly for @xmath78 .",
    "this simply states that for a fixed @xmath6 there has to be a maximal solution time ( even exponentially rare ) since the fms is `` ergodic '' or able to get out of local minima .",
    "the condition that @xmath79 be divergent with @xmath6 would then set a relation for the exponents @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "our experiments in the linear regime have not yielded any evidence for a distribution following such an ansatz , and moreover we have not explored systematically the non - linear parameter region , where such behaviour might make considering scalings as eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) interesting .",
    "the average solution time , in terms of flips per spin , is shown in figure  [ fig : probdist](a ) for @xmath82 . together with figure  [ fig : probdist](b ) , showing the tendency for the width of the distribution to diminish as @xmath83 , this @xmath84-behaviour implies rather trivial finite size corrections to @xmath85 . in the figure",
    "we depict the width of the distribution @xmath86 measured by quantiles instead of the standard deviation , since this is the most sensible measure given the nature of the data .",
    "we also tried to extract the best possible performance of the algorithm as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "using the data for varying @xmath2 allows one to extract roughly the optimal values @xmath87 which are demonstrated in figure  [ fig : etaopt ] . as can be seen , the data indicate a roughly linear increase of the optimal @xmath2 with in particular no notice of the approach to @xmath3 or to an algorithm - dependent maximum value @xmath88 .",
    "the same data can be also utilised to plot , for a fixed @xmath6 ( recall the fms runs linearly in this regime ) the solution time at the optimal noise parameter @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : etaoptime ] shows that this as expected diverges .",
    "attempts to extract the value @xmath88 limiting the linear regime by fitting to various divergences of the kind @xmath89 do not allow one to make a statistically reliable conclusion as to whether @xmath90 , though .",

    "it restricts acceptable moves based on the best configuration found so far , and is in this way non - markovian .",
    "dueck claimed good results on solving 442-city and 532-city instances of the travelling salesman problem , but after that the algorithm has been little used .",
    "initial experiments on applying the focused version of this algorithm to the satisfiability problems were reported in  @xcite .    in applying record - to - record travel to satisfiability",
    ", one again chooses as the objective function @xmath91 number of clauses unsatisfied by truth assignment @xmath19 .",
    "the local search is performed over single - variable flip neighbourhoods .",
    "we also impose the focusing condition requiring that the flipped variables are always chosen from unsatisfied clauses .",
    "( precisely : one unsatisfied clause is chosen at random , and from there a variable at random . )",
    "this leads to the _ focused _ rrt ( frrt ) algorithm .",
    "the algorithm is surprisingly powerful , as indicated by the results in figure  [ fig : frrt_scan ] .",
    "interestingly , at least within the range of values tested , the frrt algorithm does not seem to have an optimal value for the deviation parameter @xmath92 , but larger values of @xmath92 appear to always extend the linear regime of the algorithm further , albeit with increasing coefficients of linearity .",
    "e.g.  for @xmath93 the linear regime seems to extend only to about @xmath94 , but for @xmath95 already to @xmath49 , and for @xmath96 even further .    to validate these results",
    ", we again determined the normalised cumulative solution time distributions for the frrt algorithm with @xmath95 at both @xmath34 and @xmath50 , similarly as in figure  [ fig : wsat55_dist ] .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : frrt9_dist ] , frrt behaves for these parameter values more predictably than walksat at @xmath44 , and comparably to walksat at the near - optimal noise parameter value of @xmath48 .",
    "( interestingly , the frrt normalised median solution times seem to decrease slightly with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "this phenomenon is undoubtedly connected to the smoothing of the random 3-sat energy landscapes for increasing @xmath6 , but otherwise we have no clear explanation for it .",
    "it can also be observed that the shapes of the cumulative distributions are qualitatively different from the fms case . )    for comparison , figure  [ fig : frrt7_dist ] illustrates the corresponding distributions for @xmath97 .",
    "as can be seen , for @xmath34 frrt converges even with @xmath97 , but for @xmath50 a larger value of @xmath92 is required .",
    "as already mentioned in section 2 , walksat finds a solution in linear time when @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a dynamical threshold depending on the noise parameter @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath27 , the energy falls to a metastable level around which it remains fluctuating . in this metastable state",
    "new unsat clauses are produced at approximately the same rate as they are being eliminated , and a solution is found only by a lucky fluctuation , for which the waiting time is exponential in @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "our experiments show this kind of behaviour also for fms",
    ". seems to always extend the linear time regime further .",
    "] when the parameter @xmath2 is decreased away from one , the corresponding @xmath100 value increases ( cf .  figure  [ phase ] in section 6 ) .",
    "since the rate of production of unsatisfied clauses vanishes as @xmath2 decreases toward zero , it is tempting to think that if fms is in the linear time regime for some particular values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , then it remains so also for all smaller @xmath2 given that particular @xmath0 . but this seems not always to be the case .",
    "it is a common observation that excessive greediness can be detrimental to the quality of optimisation results .",
    "how is such behaviour exhibited in the case of the fms algorithm on random 3-sat ?",
    "we think that the answer is related to the concept of _ whitening _ , introduced in the context of the graph colouring problem ( hence the name ) in @xcite and applied to random 3-sat in @xcite .",
    "the constraints between variables contain slack that can be consumed too quickly by a greedy search .",
    "this slack is due to `` safe '' clauses , i.e.  clauses that contain at least two true literals . for some @xmath0 values ,",
    "if @xmath2 is too low , fms typically drives the system to a state where some unsatisfied clauses can no longer be eliminated `` locally . ''    ....",
    "whitening(f , s ) :    mark all the clauses white ( * , joker , wild card ) except those that       have only one true literal ( thus , also unsatisfied clauses are marked       white , so that they do not affect the whitening process ) ;    loop      - mark those variables white that appear as satisfying literals         only in white clauses ;      - halt , if all the variables are white ( s is completely white ) ;      - halt , if no new variables became white in this round ( s has a core ) ;      - mark those clauses white that contain at least one white variable .",
    "....    the _ whitening algorithm _ presented in figure  [ fig : whitening ] searches for _ frozen _ variables in a given truth assignment . flipping any frozen",
    "variable produces at least one new unsat clause that contains only frozen variables .",
    "to get rid of that unsat clause , one of its variables must be flipped , and that produces again at least one new unsat clause with all of its other variables frozen , and so on . the only way to do away with all of these newly produced unsat clauses is by loops , i.e.  by flip sequences that encounter some variables more than once . in random 3-sat instances these loops are typically long , growing as @xmath101 .",
    "so when @xmath102 , also the loops become infinitely long . if there are no frozen variables , the truth assignment is said to be _ completely white _ , otherwise it has a _ core _ of frozen variables ( the term core in this connection is from @xcite ) .    when energy decreases during a search , a transition can occur from a state where the encountered truth assignments are generically completely white to a state where the truth assignments generically have a core of frozen variables .",
    "we call this the _ freezing transition_. it is natural to assume that when a freezing transition has happened , the remaining unsatisfied clauses can not be eliminated in linear time , because then the search needs loops growing with the system size .    in figure",
    "[ fig : frtransit ] we present estimates of the freezing transition energy density @xmath103 for a few sample runs of the fms algorithm .",
    "we have not studied the dependence of @xmath104 on n , but it appears to be self - averaging , so that for any @xmath0 and @xmath2 for which a freezing transition occurs , @xmath105 converges to a constant value as @xmath102 .",
    "hence the @xmath105 values given in figures [ fig : frtransit ] and [ fig : alpha415 ] are similar to their @xmath102 limits .",
    "also the freezing transition time @xmath106 ( measured in flips/@xmath6 ) seems to converge for many @xmath107-pairs , but it is not at all clear that this needs to be so in every case .",
    "there may exist some region of @xmath0 and @xmath2 values for which a superlinear number of flips are required before either a satisfying solution or a truth assignment with a core is reached ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta05 ] ) .",
    "we conjecture that there are almost always truth assignments with a core at all energy levels below any level at which a freezing transition can happen at given @xmath0 .",
    "for example , this implies that one can pick an @xmath2-value for @xmath108 , such that the freezing takes place at , say , @xmath109 ( figure [ fig : frtransit ] ) .",
    "hence we believe that there exist solutions with a core also in the @xmath102 limit in some region of @xmath0-values , approximately @xmath110 .",
    "the lower bound of 4.10 has been estimated using fms with @xmath111 ( figure [ fig : frtransit ] ) . since the choice of algorithm may have an effect on the estimate , the actual threshold point below which there",
    "do not exist solutions with a core in the @xmath102 limit can be lower than this",
    ".    there may be a narrow region below @xmath3 where typical instances do not have any completely white solutions . in this region ,",
    "if it exists , focused algorithms presumably can not find a solution in linear time .",
    "on the other hand , in  @xcite it is conjectured that almost all solutions are completely white ( `` all-@xmath112 assignments '' in the terminology of  @xcite ) up to @xmath3 .",
    "this claim is based on experimental evidence using the survey propagation algorithm  @xcite , which seemingly finds only completely white solutions when n is large  @xcite , just like focused local algorithms .",
    "however , if solutions with a core can not be found in linear time , it is not surprising that usually the first solution encountered is completely white .",
    "thus , the issue of a possible core transition ( similar to the simpler xorsat problem  @xcite ) below @xmath3 remains open .",
    "we have not tried to assess which type of solution is more numerous near @xmath3 , or whether having a majority of completely white solutions is in fact a necessary or even a sufficient condition for maintaining time - linearity of local search methods .",
    "thus , we can at the moment only conjecture a relation between the algorithmic performance of local search methods and the entropy of the solution space , as measured in terms of the `` white '' and `` core '' fractions vs.  @xmath6 .",
    "another way to establish the existence of qualitatively different kinds of solutions is to look at the proportion of `` safe '' clauses ( i.e.  clauses that contain at least two satisfying literals ) in the solutions found by fms with different values of @xmath2 ( figure  [ fig : safeprop ] ) .",
    "one can say that with greater @xmath2 , better quality solutions are found .",
    "note that these safe clauses are just what enable variables to become unfrozen in the whitening algorithm ( figure  [ fig : whitening ] ) .",
    "whiteness is just one indicator that can be used during the search process to tell when the linear - time property has been lost .",
    "certainly there can be more powerful indicators that alarm about difficulties earlier , when the freezing transition has not yet happened .",
    "if a truth assignment which is not a solution is completely white , it means that any _ one _ of the still remaining unsat clauses can be resolved locally ( assuming dependency loops between clauses do nt incidentally block this ) .",
    "it does not , however , mean that an arbitrary subset of the remaining unsat clauses could necessarily be resolved locally , or that there necessarily exists a solution .",
    "a truth assignment can turn from a completely white one to having a core by the flip of just one variable .",
    "one can envision higher order whitenings : a @xmath113th order whitening would tell whether _ all _ truth assigments that differ in at most @xmath113 variable values from the assignment in question are completely white ( in the usual sense , i.e.  zeroth order whitened ) .",
    "maybe a higher order whitening with any fixed @xmath113 can ( in principle normal whitenings to compute one @xmath113th order whitening , if done in a simple `` brute force '' manner .",
    "one normal whitening can be done in time @xmath114 , if implemented well . ] ) be used as an indicator for the linear - time property , just like the zeroth order one .",
    "there can also be some indicators that have nothing to do with whitening .",
    "in this paper we have elucidated the behaviour of `` focused '' local search algorithms for the random 3-sat problem .",
    "an expected conclusion is that they can be tuned so as to extend the regime of `` good '' , linear - in - n behaviour closer to @xmath3 .",
    "an unexpected conclusion is that fms ( and walksat , and frrt ) seem to work well very close to the critical threshold .",
    "figure  [ phase ] proposes a phase diagram .",
    "fms with @xmath115 is just the random walk algorithm ; hence the first transition point is at @xmath116 . for larger @xmath0",
    "there is the possibility of having _ two phase boundaries _ in terms of the noise parameter . the upper value @xmath117 separates the linear regime from one with too much noise , in which the fluctuations of the algorithm degrade its performance . for @xmath118",
    ", greediness leads to dynamical freezing , and though fms ( in contrast to frrt in particular ) remains ergodic , or able to climb out of local minima , the algorithm no longer scales linearly in the number of variables .",
    "the phase diagram presents us with two main questions : what is the smallest @xmath0 at which @xmath119 starts to deviate from zero ? does the choice of an ideal @xmath120 allow one to push the linear regime arbitrarily close to @xmath3 ?",
    "note that the deviation of @xmath121 from unity with increasing @xmath0 could perhaps be analysed with similar techniques as the methods in refs .",
    "the essential idea there is to construct rate equations for densities of variables or clauses while ignoring correlations of neighboring ones .",
    "this would not resolve the above two main ones , of course .",
    "the resolution of these questions will depend on our understanding the performance of fms or other local search presence of the clustering of solutions .",
    "the whitening or freezing experiments provide qualitative understanding on the behaviour for small @xmath2 : too greedy search procedures are not a good idea .",
    "thus fms seems to work well only when it actually finds solutions that can be completely whitened .",
    "figure  [ phase ] also points out , via the whitening data for @xmath122 , that the line of whitening thresholds @xmath123 for fms apparently is continuous over @xmath3 .",
    "in particular in this case , one can then separate between two possible scenarios : either the @xmath117-line extends to @xmath3 and finishes there , or otherwise it meets with the @xmath123-line at an @xmath124 at a point that is `` tri - critical '' in statistical mechanics terms .",
    "note , however , that @xmath123 determined by whitening is not necessarily the highest lower bound to the linear phase .",
    "the range of the algorithm presents therefore us with a fundamental question : though replica - methods have revealed the presence of clustering in the solution space starting from @xmath9 , the fms works for much higher @xmath0 s still .",
    "the clustered solutions should have an extensive core of frozen variables , and therefore to be hard to find .",
    "thus , the existence of `` easy solutions '' for the fms tells that there are features in the solution space and energy landscape that are not well understood , since the fms can pick , for a right choice of @xmath2 _ almost always _ such easy solutions out of those available for any particular instance .",
    "this would seem to imply that such completely white ones have a considerable entropy .",
    "our numerics also implies that in the linear scaling regime the solution time probability distributions become sharper ( `` concentrate '' ) as @xmath6 increases , implying indeed that the median solution time scales linearly .",
    "we can by numerical experiments not prove that this holds also for the average behaviour , but would like to note that the empirically observed tail behaviours for the same distributions give no indication of such heavy tails that would contradict this idea .",
