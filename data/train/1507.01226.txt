    "besides being of central interest in the field , achieving large accessible times in the time evolution of strongly - correlated quantum many - body systems with existing numerical methods has proven to be a daunting task in any spatial dimension and particularly for global quenches .",
    "experiments in quantum many - body physics in the last years have evolved in such a manner that local control over degrees of freedom has become more feasible@xcite and in which quantum magnetism , spin dynamics , and relaxation dynamics have been explored .",
    "additionally , along this experimental work a whole body of theoretical investigations has arisen that relies on various analytical and numerical methods to describe the dynamics of these experiments .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath0 for a generic time - independent hamiltonian @xmath1 and initial state @xmath2 is formally solved by the time evolution operator @xmath3 where the reduced planck constant @xmath4 is set to @xmath5 .",
    "the time - evolved quantum state for arbitrary times is then given by @xmath6-dmrg@xcite , which is based on the description of the quantum state in terms of matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the computational basis , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath11-dimensional row and column vectors , respectively , and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is a @xmath14 matrix .",
    "theoretically , every quantum state can be represented by an mps if infinite matrix dimensions are allowed  @xcite .",
    "the practical relevance of such a state description lies in the fact that one can often very well approximate the exact quantum state by an mps with finite matrix dimension . from this perspective",
    ", mps presents a class of states that compress exact many - body quantum states such that the number of coefficients needed to describe the state scales linearly in the number of constituents as opposed to the exponential scaling in the exact representation .",
    "furthermore , the approximation made in the compression step is well understood@xcite and can be controlled by the matrix dimension @xmath11 .    with the help of mps",
    ", several methods have been developed to calculate the time evolution of one - dimensional many - body quantum systems@xcite .",
    "the earliest methods utilize the trotter@xcite decomposition of the time - evolution operator .",
    "later approaches approximate the matrix exponential in the krylov@xcite subspace .",
    "both methods have been successfully applied to a series of different physical problems .",
    "nevertheless , the times reachable with current methods are still very limited making the development of new methods still a very important endeavor .",
    "the limitation of evolution times accessible with mps - based methods is closely related to the amount of entanglement in the quantum state .",
    "the maximal entanglement between two subsystems describable by an mps is given by the logarithm of the matrix dimension @xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand , it has been shown that the entanglement after a quantum quench grows typically linearly in time  @xcite leading to an exponentially - growing matrix dimension , which is required in order to keep the error fixed .    in this work ,",
    "we test a new method for calculating the time evolution of one - dimensional quantum many - body systems as it was proposed in ref .   by holzner _",
    "we attempt to merge mps with the method of approximating the time - evolution operator in terms of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the procedure of expanding the time - evolution operator in terms of chebyshev polynomials is general and requires in principle solely a matrix - vector multiplication . the mps approach together with the representation of the hamiltonian as a matrix product operator provides an efficient way to perform these operations in the quantum many - body framework . a related approach based on chebyshev polynomials",
    "has recently been successfully applied in the frequency domain to obtain an efficient impurity solver for the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) algorithm@xcite and for calculating spectral functions@xcite and green s functions@xcite .    for real - time dynamics in mps",
    ", however , the approach has not been tested so far . in this paper , we test the new method ( dubbed @xmath15-chemps ) for a non - trivial system of hardcore bosons which evolve in time under the bose - hubbard hamiltonian in a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "we show that time - dependent observables can be calculated numerically exactly with the @xmath15-chemps method up to a certain time beyond which exponentially growing errors become dominant .",
    "the time reachable is given by the amount of entanglement in the @xmath16-th chebyshev vector and can be slightly increased by making use of a projection procedure onto the energy range where the initial state has finite nonzero spectral weight .",
    "we compare our results to the time - evolution methods based on the trotter@xcite expansion and krylov@xcite approximation of the time - evolution operator .",
    "we find that for the problem considered in this work the trotter - based method reaches the longest times , followed by the method based on the krylov approximation .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section [ standard ] gives a brief overview of the standard state - of - the - art methods in time evolution within the mps context .",
    "section [ tchemps ] discusses the @xmath15-chemps method and its workings .",
    "section [ ptchemps ] presents an extension of the latter , namely , _ projective _ @xmath15-chemps based on the spectral decomposition of the initial state .",
    "section [ model ] discusses the bose - hubbard - model global quench used for the simulations in this paper .",
    "the results of which are documented in section [ results ] .",
    "the paper concludes with section [ conclusion ] .",
    "instead of treating schrdinger s equation as a differential equation , one considers , for time - independent hamiltonians , the time - evolution operator @xmath17 .",
    "this sets the nontrivial task of evaluating an exponential of matrices@xcite .",
    "one of the most efficient methods is the so - called krylov subspace approximation@xcite , where one realizes that our interest lies in @xmath18 rather than @xmath17 . in dmrg",
    "@xmath19 is available efficiently , and this can be utilized through forming the krylov subspace by successive gram - schmidt orthonormalization of the set @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is assumed to be normalized here . here",
    ", @xmath22 is approximated regarding its extreme eigenvalues by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the matrix containing the @xmath16 krylov vectors thus obtained from the gram - schmidt decomposition and @xmath25 is an @xmath26 tridiagonal matrix .",
    "this approximation is up to a very good precision even for relatively small numbers of krylov vectors@xcite .",
    "thereafter , the exponential is given by the first column of @xmath27 , where the latter exponential is now much easier to calculate .",
    "another prominent and very efficient method for evaluating the above matrix exponential is the ( suzuki-)trotter decomposition@xcite .",
    "this method is mainly useful for hamiltonians with nearest - neighbor interactions . in the case of a one - dimensional chain ,",

    "in the current case , excitations start propagating from all sites with a finite speed throughout the duration of the time evolution spreading the information about the initial conditions more and more over the entire system .",
