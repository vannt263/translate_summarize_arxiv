    "quantum spin ladder systems @xcite have been studied in relation with high - t@xmath3 superconductivity and haldane s conjecture @xcite .",
    "these studies have been done mainly with 2-body interaction terms . recently from experiments on dispersion curve @xcite , @xcite , it is suggested that 4-spin exchange interactions play an important role .    in general ,",
    "spin interactions originate from electron exchange interactions .",
    "it is well known that heisenberg model is derived from the second order perturbation expansion in strong coupling limit of hubbard model .",
    "similarly higher order terms give many body spin interactions .",
    "for example , fourth order terms give the four body spin interactions , e.g. @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , in the one dimensional ( 1d ) two leg ladder , many body spin interactions appear from electron exchanges @xcite,@xcite .",
    "note that 1d nearest neighbor hubbard model does not give many body interactions , because the cyclic path is impossible on this lattice .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the spin ladder systems including 4-spin exchange term .    apart from the spin ladder systems , many - body interactions appear in 2d , 3d systems .",
    "it is experimentally known that many - body interaction can not be neglected especially in @xmath5he on graphite @xcite , and wigner crystal @xcite . as another example , in high t@xmath3 superconductor",
    "described by 2d hubbard model , many - body spin interactions appear and they may be important physically @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we shortly review for @xmath6 two - leg spin ladder systems . in sec . 3",
    ", we discuss the phase transition and the universality class from numerical results and the conformal field theory . in sec . 4",
    ", we summarize results . in appendix",
    ", we briefly explain theories used in this study , that is , @xmath7 solvable models , wzw model , logarithmic corrections .",
    "we treat the following hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the intrachain coupling , @xmath10 is the interchain coupling , and @xmath11 is the four spin exchange term which is written with spin operators @xmath12 and indexes @xmath13 are for longitudinal direction , @xmath14=1,2 are indexes of spin chains , ( see fig.[fig : jring - fig ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we shortly review the model and related studies .",
    "quantum spin ladder systems have been well studied .",
    "recently several quantum spin ladder materials are found out experimentally . and",
    "they attract much attention @xcite,@xcite .",
    "theoretically , they have been studied with bosonization method and numerical calculations . for only 2-body interaction , there are many studies .",
    "see for example , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and references therein .",
    "when there is the four spin exchange , it is expected that strange phase transitions may appear . in this region , relatively there are few studies .",
    "et al_. numerically calculated the dispersion curve in the s=@xmath0 spin ladder with the four spin exchange @xcite .",
    "they discussed it from the view point of the symmetry breaking .",
    "@xcite studied with numerical calculation for the system with the magnetization plateau . in that paper , they found out that this system is tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid with central charge @xmath15 , when magnetization m=@xmath0 , and that bkt transition occurs between tl phase and plateau phase region .",
    "@xcite investigated the energy gap and the spin - spin correlation function with the density matrix renormalization group method .",
    "recently experimentists found the real material with 4-spin cyclic exchange , i.e. , la@xmath16ca@xmath17cu@xmath18o@xmath19 . in that experiment , the dispersion relation was observed by neutron scattering , which suggests four - body terms @xcite,@xcite .",
    "when j@xmath20 , s=@xmath0 quantum spin two - leg ladder systems can be mapped to s=1 systems . thus they can be considered as a generalization of haldane s conjecture @xcite for ladder systems .",
    "haldane phase is characterized by the string order parameter , which is related to a hidden @xmath21 symmetry breaking . in s=@xmath0 ladder systems with four spin exchanges , the string order parameter was discussed by fath _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in that paper , there are two type gapped phases .",
    "one is a rung singlet type , another is the aklt type @xcite . using density matrix renormalization group , legeza _",
    "et al_. @xcite pictured phase diagram in these systems .",
    "but they have not decided phase boundary properly .",
    "et al_. @xcite referred to the relation between s=@xmath0 ladder system with four spin exchange and s=1 quantum spin chain with bilinear - biquadratic term ( see appendix a ) . in that paper , they examined behaviors of a correlation function of relative staggered magnetization and a correlation function of relative dimerization field , and suggested the phase transition with central charge @xmath22 .",
    "when @xmath23 , we can relate s=@xmath0 quantum spin ladder system with four spin exchange to s=1 quantum spin chain with bilinear - biquadratic term .",
    "when @xmath24 , is it obvious ?",
    "the discussion of legeza _",
    "et al_. @xcite is different from that of nersesyan _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "et al_. @xcite wrote that this phase transition is between a nondegenerate singlet state and a fourfold - degenerate ground state .",
    "the fourfold - degenerate ground state realizes because the singlet - triplet gap disappear .",
    "et al_. @xcite wrote that , there is the region where the triplet majorana excitation is lower than the singlet one , in which it is enough to consider only the triplet majorana excitation , thus the phase transition belongs to the second order type with @xmath22 .",
    "although both of them predicted takhtajan - babujian type transition point ( @xmath25 ) in the @xmath6 spin ladder ( with four - body terms ) , there is a difference on other critical phenomena between them .",
    "et al_. @xcite referred to @xmath26 ( the singlet majorana field becomes massless in another region ) , legeza _",
    "et al_. @xcite referred to @xmath27 uimin - lai - sutherland model @xcite .",
    "there remains controversial in this region .",
    "we study @xmath9=@xmath10=1 case with varying @xmath28 coupling in the system ( 1 ) with no magnetizations , combining numerical calculation and conformal field theory(cft ) .      at first",
    ", we study the size dependence of the ground state energy , in order to see the type of periodicity ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) under periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) . in fig.[fig : siz - fig ] , we can see that the ground state energy per site @xmath31 oscillates according to @xmath32 even or odd ( even cases are lower ) .",
    "this suggests that translational invariance by one site may be spontaneously broken . for another evidence of @xmath29 symmetry breaking ,",
    "we study the dispersion curve , which shows that the lowest excitation has soft modes at @xmath33 ( see fig.[fig : disp24-fig ] ) .",
    "thus we will study the system size l = n/2=6,8,10,12 .    in order to discuss what type of phase transitions may occur , we use the effective central charge @xmath34 , obtained from the finite size scaling of the ground state energy . from the conformal field theory at the critical point , the finite size scaling of ground state energy under the periodic boundary condition ( pbc )",
    "is the following @xcite,@xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ground state energy for size @xmath32 , @xmath37 is the energy per site in the infinite limit , @xmath38 is the spin wave velocity .",
    "in addition to the ground state energy , we should obtain @xmath38 numerically to decide @xmath34 in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the spin wave velocity @xmath38 is obtained from @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is a wave number .",
    "then we extrapotale @xmath41 as    @xmath42    in fig.[fig : cc - fig ] , we show the obtained effective central charge .",
    "the effective central charge shows a maximum value @xmath34=1.49 at @xmath28=0.192 . according to zamolodchikov s c - theorem @xcite , the effective central charge shows maximum at the infrared fixed point .",
    "thus we can conclude that there is a phase transition with the central charge @xmath22 .    only from the central charge ,",
    "there remain several possibilities for universality class . but",
    "considering the symmetry of the system , we can discuss in detail .",
    "combining the overall su(2 ) symmetry of hamiltonian , we can relate central charge @xmath22 in conformal field theory to the topological coupling constant ( kac - moody central charge ) @xmath43 in su(2 ) wess - zumino - witten model .",
    "the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath34 is given by @xmath44 thus the critical theory c=@xmath1 with su(2 ) symmetry is described as the @xmath45 su(2 ) wess - zumino - witten model .",
    "this universality class is characterized with scaling dimensions @xmath46 ( parity odd,@xmath47 ) , @xmath48 ( parity even,@xmath49 ) for the primary field ( in kac - moody algebra ) , @xmath50(parity even , marginal,@xmath49 ) for the ( kac - moody ) descendant field ( see appendix b ) .",
    "they mean that a second order transition occurs with @xmath29 symmetry breaking . and the mass ( energy ) gap is generated near the critical point as @xmath51 from @xmath48 term . here",
    "the mass gap @xmath52 is related with the correlation length @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "next we study lowest excitations with wave number @xmath47 , which consist of @xmath55 ( singlet ) and @xmath7 ( triplet ) .",
    "we can expect that these excitation are related with the scaling dimension ( @xmath46,@xmath47 ) in the @xmath45 su(2 ) wzw model .",
    "in general , from cft , scaling dimension can be calculated from the excitation energy for finite size under pbc as @xcite    @xmath56    unfortunately , in the @xmath45 su(2 ) wzw model , there are marginal corrections , 1/@xmath57 , which are difficult to treat .",
    "thus we should remove them with the method in appendix c. after removing logarithmic corrections , scaling dimension is almost independent on the system size at critical point @xmath58 ( see fig.[fig : sdim - fig ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that this universality class belongs to the @xmath45 su(2 ) wzw type .",
    "finally , we comment on the effect of the marginal operator to the ground state energy and the velocity . for ground state energy , it is proved that , @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 terms do not exist @xcite . we have neglected the @xmath62 contribution ( which is small enough ) to obtain the effective central charge . for the velocity , it is proved that there is not @xmath63 term in current - current correlation @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have neglected logarithmic correction in equation ( 5 ) .      after studying the universality class ,",
    "we proceed to discuss the symmetry breaking and the order parameter .",
    "although finite size effect prevents us from drawing a definite conclusion , we can consider several clues relating to the ordered state .    at",
    "first , for @xmath64 , the triplet excitation is lower than the singlet excitation at @xmath47 , whereas for @xmath65 , the singlet excitation is inclined to be under the triplet excitation .",
    "but this is not clear in terms of the finite size effect .",
    "secondary , besides the translational symmetry breaking , it is observed a rung - parity symmetry breaking , reversing each spin chain ( @xmath66 ) , which brehmer _ et al .",
    "_ discussed on the dispersion curve .",
    "we confirmed their dispersion curves at @xmath67 ( see fig.[fig:24-fig ] ) . in summary , in the @xmath68 limit under pbc , it is expected that , for @xmath65 , the ground state ( @xmath69 ) will be degenerate with the lowest state ( @xmath70 ) , while for @xmath64 , there is no symmetry breaking .",
    "honda _ et al .",
    "_ studied the same system as ours @xcite . using the density matrix renormalization group method , they calculated the spin gap and spin - spin correlation function .",
    "they claimed that there occurs a phase transition from a massive phase to a massless phase at @xmath71 .",
    "since they studied the open boundary condition , we think that they saw the edge state . for the @xmath7 case , in the haldane phase",
    ", the edge state can be degenerate under the open boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the four lowest energy states are almost degenerate , whose energy gap decays @xmath72 , and there is a haldane gap between them and the continuum energy spectrum . on the finite size effect",
    ", the edge state is well defined when it is sufficiently localized , that is , the system size is large enough compared with the correlation length .",
    "however , since the correlation length becomes very long near the critical point , so the finite size effect becomes large .",
    "therefore , considering edge states , it is possible to explain why honda _ et al_. estimated the critical point @xmath73 larger than ours . numerically , edge states can be confirmed by investigating the ground state energies under open boundary condition with higher magnetizations .",
    "note that edge states can be detected experimentally .",
    "in the present paper , we studied @xmath74 quantum spin ladder with four spin exchange , in order to see the phase transition type in this system .",
    "we saw the behavior of the central charge and the scaling dimension , which have logarithmic corrections . at first , we calculated the central charge , since its correction is small .",
    "the central charge has the maximum value @xmath75 at @xmath28=0.192 .",
    "removing the logarithmic correction for the scaling dimension , we obtained @xmath76 near @xmath28=0.192 . in this region ,",
    "the scaling dimension do not have a significant size dependence .",
    "so we can conclude that this phase transition belongs to a @xmath45 su(2 ) wzw type .",
    "we thank prof . takahashi informing us on the relation between electron exchange and many body spin interaction .",
    "we acknowledge a. kitazawa for fruitful discussions about spin ladder systems with many body interactions .",
    "we thank to s. qin , h. inoue , and s. hirata in other things .",
    "the numerical calculation in this paper have been done based on the package titpack ver 2.0 by h. nishimori .",
    "we shortly review the following hamiltonian . @xmath77",
    "this model is well researched .",
    "the phase diagram of this model is known in numerically @xcite,@xcite . and this model is exactly solved by bethe ansatz , at the special point @xmath78=@xmath79,@xmath80,0 .",
    "the critical point @xmath78=@xmath79 is takhtajan - babujian point @xcite @xcite .",
    "this is the critical point between dimer phase and haldane phase .",
    "it is known that this critical theory is described as @xmath22 cft or @xmath45 su(2 ) wzw model @xcite , which is equivalent to three majorana fermions .    for general spin s , takhtajan - babujian type",
    "solvable models are described as wess - zumino - wittten non - linear @xmath81 model(wzw model ) with topological coupling constant @xmath82 @xcite , @xcite , in terms of the analysis for quantum spin systems using non - abelian bosonization @xcite .",
    "another bethe ansatz solvable point at @xmath83 is equivalent to @xmath84 su(3 ) wzw model with @xmath27 .",
    "this is known as uimin - lai - sutherland model @xcite . above @xmath85 , although there is not su(3 ) symmetry , the massless region extends with the @xmath30 symmetry quasi breaking , and soft modes appear at @xmath86 . recently from non - abelian bosonization and renormalization group analysis , it is shown that this is a variant of the bkt transition ( but the different universality class @xcite ) .",
    "the minimal conformal field theory with the smallest spectrum containing currents obeying the kac - moody algebra with central charge @xmath34 is the wess - zumino - witten non - linear @xmath81 model , with topological coupling constant @xmath43 .",
    "thus the relation between @xmath34 and @xmath43 is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is dimension for an arbitrary representation and @xmath89 is called as the dual coxeter number . in the present case , since the system has su(2 ) symmetry , we have @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "now we think of the case with the su(2 ) symmetry . in this case , primary fields can be classified according to their left and right moving spin .",

    "their scaling dimensions are @xmath93 the operators with @xmath94 half - odd integer ( integer ) are odd ( even ) under translation by one site ; thus they correspond to states with momentum @xmath95 ( zero ) .    here",
    "we think of the case of the @xmath45 su(2 ) wzw model . in the case of @xmath96 , which forms @xmath97 ,",
    "the scaling dimension is @xmath46 . in the case of",
    "@xmath98 which forms @xmath99 , the scaling dimension is @xmath48 .    besides kac - moody primary operators",
    ", there is a marginal operator for all @xmath43 , namely @xmath100 ( which is a primary field with respect to the virasoro algebra ) .",
    "current operator @xmath101 has the conformal weight @xmath102 and @xmath103 has the conformal weight @xmath104 .",
    "thus the @xmath100 operator has the conformal weight @xmath105 which has the scaling dimension @xmath106 and the conformal spin 0 , i.e. wave number @xmath49 .",
    "current operators @xmath107 , @xmath103 themselves have conformal spin @xmath108 , corresponding to the wave number @xmath109 , thus they are related with the spin wave velocity .",
    "according to the non - abelian bosonization , in su(2 ) symmetric gapless system , the excitation energies ( for @xmath33 states ) , including logarithmic corrections , are @xmath110 where @xmath32 is a system size , and @xmath38 is a spin wave velocity . here",
