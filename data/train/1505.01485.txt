    "moreover , @xcite have found that the imf slope of some representative massive galaxies depends on galactocentric distance . since the inferred properties of a stellar population",
    "strongly depend on the adopted imf @xcite , it is important to investigate the stellar populations of massive systems such as ngc  1277 while relaxing the assumption of a universal imf .    the importance of measuring the behaviour of the imf as a function of radius in ngc  1277 is two - fold . on the one hand",
    ", it provides a route to understanding the physical conditions of massive galaxies when the majority of their stars were formed , with no influence from later accretion events .",
    "on the other hand , ngc  1277 shows an atypical combination of kinematical and stellar population properties @xcite , which can be used to investigate the main driver behind these imf variations .    by studying the radial variation of imf - sensitive spectral indices in ngc  1277 , we have been able to derive its imf radial profile , which remains bottom - heavy up to @xmath3 1.5 .",
    "we have simultaneously inferred , in a self - consistent manner ( i.e. , by adopting the best - fitting imf value at each radius ) , its age , metallicity and [ mg / fe ] gradients . here",
    "we find that the claims made by @xcite regarding ngc  1277 as being a relic object are also supported under the assumption of a steep imf .",

    "these data have a ( wavelength - dependent ) resolution ranging from @xmath11  at @xmath12  to @xmath13  at @xmath14 .",

    "this allowed for a clean sky emission removal by subtracting consecutive exposures .",
    "the second crucial aspect was that of correcting the spectra for telluric absorption features . in order to investigate the impact of such correction on the derived stellar population parameters",
    ", we adopted two independent approaches . the spectrophotometric standard star ( hiltner 600 , b1 )",
    "was targeted at the end of the observations . using the iraf task _",
    "telluric _ , the derived atmospheric transmission spectrum was scaled to correct the ngc  1277 data .",
    "in addition , we made use of the eso tool molecfit  @xcite .",
    "the latter does not require any extra calibration data ( i.e. a spectrophotometric standard star ) as it constructs a synthetic atmospheric absorption model for a given spectrum , by fitting spectral regions dominated by telluric absorption in the spectrum itself  8130,8300   ; @xmath16  7585,7698   ; @xmath16  7235,7326    and @xmath16  6861,6924   , where strong h@xmath17o and o@xmath17 telluric features are found . ] .",

    "the differences in the inferred stellar population properties among the two approaches are described in appendix a.    since the analysis of stellar populations requires a higher signal - to - noise ( sn ) than kinematics , we performed a first radial binning by imposing a sn threshold of 20 .",

    "the later accretion of less massive satellites ( with `` standard '' kroupa - like imf slopes ) , which would settle preferentially in the galaxy periphery due to their lower densities , would steepen the pristine imf gradient making it more similar to that found in nearby massive galaxies  @xcite .    indeed , we hypothesize that relic galaxies , such as ngc  1277 , will evolve to become the cores of massive ellipticals in the nearby universe  @xcite . the bulk of the stellar mass of this galaxy was formed in a short ( @xmath4 myr ) and intense ( sfr @xmath5 /yr ) burst at redshift @xmath65 , but remained concentrated within a few kpcs in the centre of the dark matter halo .",

    "in addition , the active intracluster environment may have inhibited the subsequent formation of younger stellar populations within ngc  1277 either via the stripping or heating of cold gas @xcite . in this sense , @xcite have recently shown that in the bolshoi numerical simulation @xcite , dark matter haloes similar to those hosting ngc  1277-like objects have experienced below - average mass accretion , or even mass loss , since @xmath72 .",
    "finally , we find that the radial imf behaviour seen in ngc  1277 is not driven by the local velocity dispersion , and therefore , it can not explain the imf variations seen in etgs .",
    "the fact that the imf slope can vary radially within galaxies @xcite suggests a complex galaxy formation scenario , with significantly different enrichment and supernovae - feedback rates when comparing the centre and the outskirts of etgs .",
    "thus , more observational efforts are needed to better understand the imf behaviour in nearby galaxies , investigating what stellar population properties can explain the observed imf variations . in this sense",
    ", large resolved spectroscopic surveys such as califa @xcite and manga will provide statistically significant samples .",
    "in addition , the joint analysis of the imf inferred from dynamical modelling and from stellar population analysis can reveal important information about the interplay between galaxy stellar population properties and dynamics .",
    "the intrinsic degeneracies of these methods ( @xmath73 ratios , dark matter content , stellar remnants and central black - hole mass ) may be broken if both approaches are combined .",

    "to check the reliability of the imf gradient of ngc1277 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imf ] ) , we have explored three possible sources of systematics , namely , errors on telluric absorption correction , the effect of non - solar elemental abundances , and the nebular emission contamination to the h@xmath44 line .",
    "these tests  supporting the robustness of our results  have been performed because of some discrepancies between the best - fitting and observed line - strengths ( see sec .

    "the fact that the best - fitting h@xmath44 lies above the observed values ( panel ( c ) in fig .",

    ", the nebular emission correction to h@xmath44 has been estimated in a self - consistent manner ( see la barbera et al .",
    "2013 for details ) , i.e. , for each imf slope ( @xmath33 ) explored in the fitting process , we apply the correction calculated by simultaneously fitting the h@xmath74 line profile with a 2 ssp model ( for a given @xmath33 ) plus a gaussian emission line . for the two innermost radial bins , the correction turned out to be fully consistent with zero regardless of @xmath33 , while in the bins from @xmath19 to @xmath75  , a mild correction was found   values ( blue dots ) in fig .",

    "[ fig : ind ] are due to residual nebular contamination .",
    "note also that underestimating h@xmath44 ( in particular for the outermost bins ) would imply that , given the age sensitivity of the tio features , the inferred imf slope is shallower than the `` true '' one , hence strengthening our conclusion about a shallow imf gradient in ngc1277 . the possible explanation for the mismatch between the best - fitting and observed h@xmath44 may reside in the uncertainty of the stellar population models used to account for non - solar abundance ratios on line strengths ( in particular h@xmath44 ) .",

    "[ eq : method ] can be expanded as follows ( see  3.3 in * ? ? ?",

    "following @xcite , we have considered only the effect of elemental abundances of selected gravity - sensitive features , i.e. @xmath82 , na , and ti .",
