    "a topic of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics is how the presence of defects or impurities induce strong modifications on the local electronic properties of crystalline solids .",
    "these modifications , with the stunning development of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , have been extensively investigated on metal surfaces where they are well known as friedel oscillations and manifest as standing waves in the local electronic density spanning regions up to @xmath710 nm from the defects on the metal surfaces .",
    "one kind of particularly suitable prototype that have been used in a large amount of stm measurements to study the effects of impurity and the formation of adsorbate superstructure are the ( 111 ) surfaces of noble metals , on which the surface - state electrons form a two - dimensional ( 2d ) nearly free - electron gas .",
    "these shockley - type surface states are dispersed as @xmath8 ( measured relative to the bottom of the surface - state band ) and localized in narrow band gaps in the center of the first brillouin zone of the ( 111)-projected bulk band structure .",
    "thus they have extremely small fermi wave vectors @xmath9 and consequently the friedel oscillations of the surface state have a significantly larger wavelength than those of the bulk states .",
    "recently , topological insulator ( ti ) has attracted tremendous experimental and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "unlike ( 111 ) surfaces of noble metals , a peculiar characteristic of ti is the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which results in a variety of unique properties .",
    "one intriguing fact is that the ideal ti surface is described at low energies by a 2d massless - dirac wave equation with an additional locking between momentum and spin of surface electron .",
    "because of the dirac spectrum and soc induced fermionic chirality , the impurity scattering effect in tis is naturally expected to display novel behavior that should be absent from the conventional semiconductor or metal - surface 2d electron gases",
    ". many experimental and theoretical efforts towards this issue have been payed .",
    "the anomalous friedel oscillations in the vicinity of a single localized impurity @xcite , as well as the identification of the nature and the precise location of impurities on ti surface using stm @xcite , have been discussed . however , when impurities are located close to each other , multiple scattering effects should be important , such as the issue of the long - range interactions between the adsorbates mediated by the dirac electrons of ti surface @xcite .",
    "in particular , since the quasiparticle s spin is strongly coupled to its momentum , quantum interference between different spin states during multiple scattering process could then display prominent phenomena such as electric conductance weak ( anti-)localization @xcite and aharonov - bohm effect @xcite in stm signals .    in the presence of the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) ,",
    "the backscattering induced by nonmagnetic impurities is forbidden on the gapless ti surface because of a @xmath10 berry phase associated with the @xmath11 adiabatic rotation of dirac electron spin along the fermi energy surface . however , considering the magnetic impurities on the gapless ti surface , one would like to observe the backscattering since the trs is broken .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to exploring this issue .",
    "for example , very recently , quasiparticle interference induced by a magnetic co adatom on gapless bi@xmath12se@xmath13 surface has been found in stm experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a magnetic field can be generated when the ti sample is deposited on a lithographically patterned ferromagnetic layer , which could also induce backscattering of massless dirac electrons in ti @xcite .",
    "because of its importance both from basic point of interest and to ti - based chemical catalysis and electronics , in the present paper we address this issue by presenting a first attempt at the theoretical evaluation of the multiple scattering problem of the massless dirac electrons on the ti surface in the presence of localized and identical magnetic impurities .",
    "specially , we present the analytical expressions for multiple partial - wave scattering of massless dirac electrons with magnetic impurities , based on which the asymptotic multiple scattering amplitude for random arraying magnetic impurities are obtained under the particular large distance approximations ( the identical impurities are treated as a large scattering center ) . the differential and total cross sections ( css ) , the inverse momentum relaxation time , and the hall component of resistivity are discussed .",
    "we find that differing from the nonmagnetic scattering , for the magnetic impurity scattering , the cs is not convergent under @xmath4wave approximation .",
    "therefore , higher partial waves should be introduced . for the single magnetic impurity scattering ,",
    "we show the fact that the backscattering becomes much stronger when increasing the effective magnetic moment @xmath5 . by comparing the inverse momentum relaxation time with total cs",
    ", we can determine whether there exist more backscattering than forward scattering or not .",
    "similar to cs , the inverse momentum relaxation time and hall factor display oscillating behavior for multiple magnetic scattering centers due to interference .",
    "the eigenstates of the effective low - energy hamiltonian of ti surface near the dirac point @xcite @xmath14 are given by the spinors @xmath15{cc}% 1 , & \\mp ie^{i\\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}}}% \\end{array } \\right )   ^{\\text{t}}$ ] , where the upper / lower sign corresponds to the electron / hole part of the spectrum .",

    "if the measurements are performed at a temperature higher than the kondo temperature @xcite , the coupling between impurity spins will not exceed the critical value @xmath26 before a kondo effect occurs . in this work",
    "we assume that the exchange coupling @xmath27 , so that the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interactions between impurity spins and kondo screening of the impurity spin by the band electrons are neglected , and the impurity spin acts as a classical local magnetic moment under mean - field approximation @xcite .    in order to obtain the analytical expressions of wavefunctions ,",
    "we just consider the component of the classical spin along the normal line of ti surface , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "the fact that a magnetic co impurity with only perpendicular spin component on the ti surface does not open a gap has been experimentally observed @xcite . to develop a scattering theory from localized , cylindrically - symmetric scatterers , it is convenient to resolve the problem in cylindrical coordinates . by considering the continuity of the wavefunction at the boundary of the magnetic scattering potential ,",

    "the inverse electron momentum relaxation time @xmath3 is a fairly sensitive quantity that determines whether the charge carrier is attracted to an impurity or is repelled from it .",
