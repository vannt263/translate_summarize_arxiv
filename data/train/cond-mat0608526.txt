    "furthermore , we assume that at initial time @xmath25 , the density matrix of qubit plus bath , @xmath26 , is of the feynman - vernon type , i.e.  the bath is in thermal equilibrium and uncorrelated with the qubits , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the canonical ensemble of the bosons .",

    "the time evolution allows the interpretation that before the transit time is reached , uncorrelated noise affects the qubits and entails an entanglement decay .",
    "after the transit time , the noise at the two positions is sufficiently correlated to establish a decoherence - free subspace . in the remote limit @xmath78 , the concurrence of the robust state finally vanishes and ,",
    "thus , the residual entanglement for finite @xmath67 can be attributed to spatial bath correlations .",
    "we emphasise that for a one - dimensional bath , this scenario holds true for all temperatures .",
    "an intuitive physical picture for the observed entanglement dynamics is that at long times , decoherence is governed by the low - frequency modes of the bath . owing to their large wavelengths ,",
    "these modes act effectively as a collective bath coordinate which leaves the entanglement robust . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the role of the low - frequency modes is suppressed and , thus , the long - time behaviour may be significantly different  @xcite .",
    "figure [ figconcurrenceexact]c reveals that for a three - dimensional bath , in general the concurrence   decays and saturates at a finite value which stays larger for closer qubits . in the experimentally relevant limit of low temperatures and @xmath79 ,",
    "the final concurrence emerges as @xmath80 however , the saturation generally occurs already at a time @xmath81 , i.e.  long before a field distortion can have propagated from one qubit to the other . to make this statement more quantitative",
    ", we numerically estimate the duration @xmath82 of the concurrence decay by the time at which 90% of the decay has happened .",
    "figure  [ figdecaytime ] shows that @xmath83 . in particular",
    ", @xmath82 is independent of the spatial separation @xmath67 , unless the qubits are very close .",
    "hence the saturation of @xmath84 can not be explained as a delayed build - up of a dfs . instead",
    ", a single - qubit mechanism must be at work , since at times @xmath85 , the qubits experience effectively _ uncorrelated _ noise .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the resemblance of @xmath86 to the single - qubit coherence @xmath87 shown in fig .",
    "[ figsinglequbitdecoherence ] . a second difference to the one - dimensional case concerns the remote limit of the qubits : for @xmath78 , the stationary value is still finite . in this limit , @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ eqcexactimplicit ] ) is negligible and the concurrence is given by the square of the finite single - qubit coherence .",
    "the concurrence   depends only quadratically on @xmath67 and , thus , is rather robust against variations of the separation , provided the separation is small .",
    "such robustness was predicted  @xcite and confirmed experimentally  @xcite for symmetry - breaking perturbations .",
    "interestingly , eq .   shows that the concurrence is robust against temperature variations as well , about which the theory in ref .  @xcite makes no predictions .",
    "if the qubits are initially in the fragile state @xmath89 , a one - dimensional bath causes an entanglement decay that becomes faster once the transit time is reached ; see fig .",
    "[ figconcurrenceexact]b . as for the robust state @xmath72 , cooperative effects only set in after a time @xmath67 . whether the qubits are spatially separated or not , for a one - dimensional environment their concurrence @xmath90 ultimately decays to zero .",
    "the three - dimensional case again bears more surprises , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figconcurrenceexact]d : the concurrence   decays , but the final value @xmath91 is nonzero , in contrast to earlier statements  @xcite . for low temperatures such that @xmath92 , the long - time limit is given by @xmath93 this asymptotic value can be increased by reducing the temperature and by increasing the qubit separation . for a separation @xmath94 , @xmath95 , i.e.  the concurrence of both the `` robust '' and the `` fragile '' state become identical ; cf.the solid lines in figs .",
    "[ figconcurrenceexact]c , d .",
    "the explicit evaluation of the exact reduced dynamics of two qubits with a nondemolitian coupling to a bosonic heat bath allowed us to investigate the consequences of a spatial qubit separation .",
    "we focused on two bell states whose entanglement for vanishing separation is either robust or fragile .",
    "the most significant consequence of a finite spatial separation is that the entanglement of the robust bell state no longer remains robust : it decays initially , yet after a time @xmath96 , it saturates . indeed , it is interesting to find stable finite bipartite entanglement even at high temperatures in our macroscopic system - bath model , which resembles recent results for a quite different model  @xcite .",
    "the duration @xmath97 of the entanglement decay depends sensitively on the dimension of the environment : in one dimension , it equals the transit time of the field from one qubit to the other . in three dimensions , by contrast , the saturation is governed by a single - qubit effect and @xmath97 is approximately given by the inverse of the cutoff frequency @xmath39 . rather surprisingly , these durations exhibit only a weak temperature dependence .    in a typical solid - state substrate ,",

    "the coherent oscillation period is @xmath105{s}$ ] , so that in the three - dimensional environment the concurrence of the robust bell state undergoes a decay only during a very short initial stage . at later times",
    ", a decoherence - free subspace is established and , thus , the concurrence stays robust .    for the fragile bell state , a three - dimensional environment in combination with a finite qubit separation prevents the entanglement from decaying entirely .",
    "if the qubits are sufficiently well separated , i.e.  for @xmath106 , the entanglement of the `` fragile '' and the `` robust '' bell state even assumes practically the same final value . in the above example",
    ", this is already the case if the qubit - qubit distance is larger than @xmath107{\\mu m}$ ] , which usually holds for solid - state qubits . for typical parameters ,",
    "the concurrence initially drops to and then remains at values of the order 0.9 already long before a first coherent oscillation is performed .",
    "thus , uncorrelated phase noise creates decoherence - poor subspaces , which might be used for quantum information processing when complemented with quantum error correction protocols ."
