    "the study of _ universal crossing probabilities _ in the standard random percolation problem at criticality has been the subject of much interest over the last decade   ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . at the percolation threshold , @xmath5 , on a rectangular lattice with length @xmath6 and width @xmath7 , the probability to have at least one cluster crossing the system in one of the two directions ( or in both ) is a _ scale - invariant _ quantity in the _ continuum limit _ where the lattice spacing @xmath8 . actually , the crossing probability is a function @xmath9 of the aspect ratio , @xmath10 , and depends also on the boundary conditions .",
    "it remains universal in the sense that it does not depend on the lattice type or whether one is considering site , bond or site - bond percolation .",
    "following the pioneering numerical work of langlands  @xcite , cardy  @xcite obtained an analytical expression for the crossing probability between opposite sides of a rectangle .",
    "he combined the correspondence between percolation and the limit @xmath11 of the @xmath12-state potts model  @xcite with boundary conformal field theory techniques to calculate the crossing probability between two segments on the boundary of a half - plane at criticality .",
    "a conformal mapping could then be used to transform the half - plane result into the rectangular geometry .",
    "cardy s and another crossing probability formula have been recently proven rigorously  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo  @xcite and exact results  @xcite have been obtained for the probability to find @xmath13 incipient spanning clusters connecting two disjoint segments at the boundary of a finite system .",
    "more recently , crossing probabilities on same - spin ising clusters in two dimensions have been also considered  @xcite .",
    "let us notice that the existence of a _ scale - invariant _ crossing probability is not a trivial result . in the case of ordinary percolation , for example , it is linked to the vanishing , in the limit @xmath11 , of the scaling dimension @xmath14 of a boundary condition changing operator of the potts model  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the behaviour of crossing probabilities in anisotropic critical systems .",
    "we first give an exact treatment of weakly anisotropic standard percolation .",
    "we show how a length rescaling technique , which has been used in other contexts  @xcite , allows to generalize cardy s exact results in this situation",
    ". then we turn to crossing probabilities in strongly anisotropic systems . to our knowledge ,",
    "such problems have not been considered before , at least with the appropriate anisotropic scaling analysis .",
    "we start with the random walk with absorbing boundary conditions in the continuum limit which can be considered as a linearized mean - field approximation  @xcite for directed percolation  @xcite and illustrates on an exactly solvable example the behaviour of the crossing probability in strongly anisotropic systems .",
    "finally we present the results of monte carlo simulations for the crossing probability in directed percolation , a strongly anisotropic problem which has so far defied all attempts at an exact solution , even in two dimensions .",
    "we consider the random bond percolation on a square lattice with anisotropic bond occupation probabilities .",
    "the system is rectangular and the bond probability is @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) in the direction parallel to the side with length @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the correlation lengths , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , diverge along the critical line where @xmath19 with the same exponent @xmath20 for both directions but different amplitudes @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the isotropy can be restored  @xcite by rescaling the lattice parameter anisotropically so that @xmath23 .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath24 is then changed into an effective one @xmath25 in the second expression the effective aspect ratio involves the lengths measured in units of the corresponding correlation lengths .",
    "the critical amplitude ratio @xmath26 , which is non - universal , is known for the @xmath12-state potts model on the square lattice  @xcite . in the percolation limit , @xmath11 ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath27 which solves the problem for a weak anisotropy .",
    "when the anisotropy axis is not parallel to one edge of the rectangle , the rescaling leads to an isotropic system with the shape of a parallelogram .",
    "standard conformal methods do not apply in strongly anisotropic systems .",
    "the simplest example of such a system is the random walk in @xmath0  dimensions , which may be considered as a directed walk in space - time . in the continuum limit",
    ", the probability density @xmath28 satisfies the diffusion equation @xmath29 we assume a uniform initial probability density @xmath30 and absorbing boundary conditions at  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 .",
    "the solution is then obtained as the following eigenvalue expansion : @xmath33 \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(2p+1)^2\\pi^2dt}{l^2}\\right]\\ , .",

    "\\label{e - cross - rw}\\ ] ] thus the crossing probability shown in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] is a universal function of the scaled variable @xmath36 , product of the aspect ratio @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the dynamical exponent for the random walk , by the non - universal inverse diffusion constant @xmath39 .    in strongly anisotropic systems ,",
    "such a behaviour generally follows from anisotropic scaling  @xcite . under the anisotropic scale transformation , @xmath40 , @xmath41",
    ", the crossing probability behaves as : @xmath42 for a dimensionless crossing probability , @xmath43 , one obtains the scale - invariant behaviour mentioned above with @xmath44 .    the probability density for a walker starting at @xmath19 with uniform probability on the segment @xmath45 $ ] to die at time @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 = \\frac{4d}{l^2}\\,\\vartheta_2\\left [ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4\\pi^2dt}{l^2}\\right)\\right]\\ , , \\label{e - surv - rw}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a jacobi theta function .",
    "since the linearized mean - field approximation for directed percolation  @xcite is also governed by the diffusion equation  ( [ e - dif ] ) , the mean - field crossing probability for directed percolation is given by  ( [ e - cross - rw ] ) when the aspect ratio is sufficiently small .",
    "the critical crossing probability in the time direction , @xmath49 , has been studied via monte carlo simulations for bond and site directed percolation on the square lattice , with the time axis along the diagonal direction .",
    "space and time coordinates take integer and half - integer values alternatively on successive spatial rows and @xmath50 .",
    "there are two directed bonds leaving a site at @xmath51 and terminating on the sites at @xmath52 .",
    "sites may be wet or dry and a directed percolation cluster is a collection of connected wet sites starting from some source at @xmath19  @xcite . in the bond problem ,",
    "bonds are open with probability @xmath53 .",
    "a site is wet at time @xmath54 when it is connected through an open bond to a site which was wet at time @xmath46 . in the site problem",

    "a site is wet at time @xmath54 when it is occupied and connected to a site which was wet at time @xmath46 .",
    "a _ scale - invariant crossing probability _ is obtained when all the sites are wet in the initial state at @xmath19 .",
    "the critical crossing probability was calculated for @xmath55 samples with sizes @xmath56 to @xmath57 and different values of the aspect ratio , @xmath37 , ranging from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "the percolation thresholds @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the dynamical exponent @xmath62 were taken from ref .",
    "either periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) or free boundary conditions ( fbc ) were used at @xmath63 and @xmath32 .",
    "the samples were grouped into 20 packets in order to evaluate the errors on @xmath49 .",
    "the raw data @xmath49 versus @xmath64 are shown in fig .",
    "2a for the largest sizes .",
    "the statistical errors are actually smaller than the size of the symbols .",
    "the scale invariance is manifest and finite size corrections to the leading behaviour are quite weak .",
    "there is a shift in @xmath64 between the curves for site and bond percolation which is the same for pbc and fbc . as shown in fig .",
    "2b , an universal curve is obtained for each type of boundary condition after the curves corresponding to the site problem have been shifted by the same amount .    in this strongly anisotropic problem ,",
    "the correlation lengths , @xmath65 in the space direction and @xmath66 in the time direction , diverge as @xmath67 thus , generalizing the behaviour for the weakly anisotropic system in eq .",
    "( [ e - reff ] ) , for each type of boundary conditions , @xmath68 or @xmath69 , one expects the crossing probability @xmath49 to be an universal function @xmath70 of the scale - invariant ratio @xmath71 in agreement with anisotropic scaling in eq .",
    "( [ e - scaling ] ) . as above for weakly anisotropic percolation and for the random - walk ,",
    "the constant @xmath4 is non - universal and takes different values , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , for the site and bond directed percolation on the diagonal square lattice .    for a given type of boundary conditions ,",
    "the crossing probability @xmath49 is the same for couples of values of the aspect ratio @xmath74 and @xmath75 such that the arguments of the universal function @xmath70 are the same for the site and bond problems .",
    "this happens when @xmath76 .",
    "thus , with a logarithmic scale , the two curves have a relative shift @xmath77    this shift was estimated for the different sizes for 6 points in the ascending part of the the curves .",
    "since the points for the site and bond problems correspond to slightly different ordinates , a direct estimation of the shift was not possible .",
    "instead we used a polynomial interpolation for the curve corresponding to the bond problem and the value of the abscissa associated with the common value of the ordinate was determined through the tangent method .",
    "the results for the ratio of non - universal amplitudes as a function of the inverse size are shown in fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] for pbc and fbc .",
    "they converge from above and from below to the common asymptotic value @xmath78 corresponding to the shift @xmath79 which was used to obtain the data collapse in fig .",
    "the same universal crossing probability is obtained for any finite homogeneous density of wet sites in the initial state at @xmath19 although the finite - size corrections to the leading scale - invariant behaviour is stronger at large values of @xmath24 ( small @xmath46 ) when the initial density decreases . with a single wet site at @xmath80 in the initial state , i.e. , for an asymptotically vanishing initial density , the crossing probability remains a function of @xmath81 but the scale - invariance is lost , @xmath49 decaying as @xmath82 .",
    "the probability @xmath83 to find @xmath13 clusters crossing the system in the time direction at @xmath5 has been also studied .",
    "details will be given elsewhere .",
    "this work can be extended by considering the crossing probability on same - spin clusters in strongly anisotropic spin systems , like the three - dimensional uniaxial annni model at the lifshitz point , for which presumably exact results for the form of the correlation functions , following from a generalization of local scale invariance  @xcite , have been obtained recently  @xcite ."
