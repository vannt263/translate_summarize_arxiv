    "flavor symmetry is presently understood on the basis of qcd and the structure of the quark mass matrix . in the zero quark mass limit ,",
    "the light flavor sector of qcd acquires a three flavor chiral symmetry @xmath5 which at the level of hadrons is assumed to be realized in the goldstone phase .",
    "the associated goldstone bosons are identified with the lightest pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the first problem one encounters in that scheme is the large mass of the @xmath6 .",
    "the way out of this problem is to take into account quantum corrections which spoil the conservation of the singlet axial current . particularly relevant to this problem",
    "is the existence of euclidean solutions with non - trivial topological properties ( instantons ) which also break the u(1)@xmath7 symmetry .",
    "in fact , the most appealing explanation of the problem of the large @xmath8 mass is provided by the instanton induced quark - quark interaction @xcite .",
    "the second problem concerns the different symmetries for pseudoscalar and axial vector mesons , on the one side , and vector and tensor mesons , on the other side .",
    "isoscalar vector mesons closely follow the flavor basis structure : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this contrasts the singlet - octet pattern followed by the isoscalar axial vector and pseudoscalar mesons . to explain this dilemma ,",
    "the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule @xcite was invoked that forbids the mixing of of quarkonia made of @xmath11 or @xmath12 quarks with quarkonia made of @xmath13 or @xmath14 quarks . in the absence of symmetry breaking terms one can freely use any basis for the generators of the group . the physically interesting basis is the one whose generators still reflect a residual symmetry of the system in the presence of symmetry breaking terms . in that regard , we have three sources of breaking @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the first one is the @xmath15 symmetry breaking by quantum effects .",
    "although the instanton induced interaction is suppressed at high energies due to the factor @xmath16 , it is always present and even becomes decisive at low energies .",
    "the second source is the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry occurring at the scale @xmath17 .",
    "the third source is the non - vanishing quark mass matrix that explicitly violates three flavor chiral symmetry .",
    "isospin is a good symmetry for hadronic strong interactions , and in the isospin limit the quark mass matrix simplifies to @xmath18 = diag(@xmath19,@xmath19,@xmath20 ) .",
    "this matrix can be written in terms of the @xmath21 ( not of @xmath22 ) generators .",
    "using @xmath22 would require to consider simultaneously two irreducible representations , the singlet and the octet .",
    "the problem of the conflicting flavor symmetries of the anomalous- and anomaly - free meson sectors was addressed e.g.  in ref .",

    "the @xmath22 flavor symmetry for the pseudoscalar and axial vector mesons appears as an artifact of the axial @xmath24 gluon anomaly .",
    "it is the goal of the present study to show that unitary spin is an accidental symmetry ( in the language of ref .",

    "the angles in the two bases are related as @xmath45 in such a way that the physical mixing angle @xmath40 in the ozi basis corresponds to the value @xmath46 in the octet - singlet basis and thereby lies between the quadratic and linear mixing angles .",
    "to study the formation of the `` eightfold way '' in an explicit framework , we introduce here a chirally symmetric @xmath47 lagrangian for a scalar and a pseudoscalar mesonic nonet , in turn denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 where the lagrangian @xmath51 describes the flavor - symmetric part , the lagrangian @xmath52 the flavor - breaking from the @xmath15 gluon anomaly , and the lagrangian @xmath53 the explicit symmetry breaking .",

    "as we will show below , the main effect in furnishing the masses of the isoscalar - pseudoscalar mesons comes from the axial @xmath15 gluon anomaly .",
    "there exist two candidates for the phenomenological description of the above effect that are associated with two different contributions to @xmath66 that lead to @xmath24 symmetry breaking at the level of qcd .",

    "consequences of this mechanism were investigated at the level of the fundamental theory in @xcite where axial ward identities were exploited to extract information on pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "however , there exists a relation between these two mechanisms for the @xmath15-breaking . indeed , by assuming a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value of @xmath71 and expanding in powers of the `` fluctuation '' @xmath72 the authors of ref.@xcite showed that both effective interactions can be linked as @xmath73 the first term on the l.h.s . of eq.([ins - vw ] ) can even be related to @xmath74 itself by a further expansion in powers of the fluctuation @xcite .",
    "clearly , these are not the only possibilities for the breaking @xmath15 symmetry . other possibilities arising from different approximations in the calculational schemes of instanton effects",
    "have been proposed @xcite . in the present work",
    "we restrict ourselves to the usage of the effective t hooft interaction . at the phenomenological level it is a promising candidate not only for providing a mechanism of the flavor - mixing but also for simultaneously explaining the unusual properties of scalar mesons , including the long standing problem of the two - photon decays of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite .",

    "equations ( [ snsmixing3 ] ) show that the mixing between strange and non - strange quarkonia is due to the instanton - induced interactions _ and _ the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry .    in the following",

    "( [ etawafu ] ) above .",
    "in addition , one finds the following trace relation @xmath124 to be valid . as a trivial consequence of eq.([mixing ] ) , the following relation holds : @xmath125 . together with eq.([trace ] ) it induces @xmath126 such that @xmath127 the five parameters entering the _ pseudoscalar _ sector of the model ( @xmath128 ) can be fixed through the masses and the decay constants of the pseudoscalars ( @xmath129 ) and can be used to predict all the other properties of the pseudoscalar mesons such as the mixing of the strange and non - strange fields ( see model1 of table  [ input ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the kaon decay constant @xmath130 can be used as input , replacing the combination ( @xmath131 ) of the above given quantities  @xcite ( see model2 of table  [ input ] with the input ( @xmath132 ) ) .",
    "the latter procedure creates slightly different results for the pseudoscalar mixing angle .",
    "finally , one could also have used the pseudoscalar mixing angle as input @xcite ( see models 3a and 3b of table  [ input ] with the input ( @xmath133 ) ) .",
    "this leads to a different identification of the scalar nonet .",
    "the pertinent masses turn out to be highly sensitive to the choice for the input parameters . in particular ,",
    "the latter version yields heavy scalars  @xcite .",
    "now , by inserting ( [ unmixedmasses ] ) for @xmath134 , @xmath135 and ( [ snsmixing1][snsmixing3 ] ) for @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 where the latter are linked to @xmath139 , @xmath140 by the relations ( [ trace][m2m2 ] ) , one can express the @xmath141 parameter in terms of the pseudoscalar meson masses according to @xmath142 the physical solution found here coincides with the phenomenologically favored one of the two solutions of the quadratic equation for @xmath141 reported in an earlier work @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath90 can be directly fixed through the first of eqs.([fkfpi ] ) , whereas @xmath91 , parameterized as @xmath143 , can be fixed either through a fit of the kaon mass as @xmath144 @xcite , or directly through @xmath130 in the second of eqs.([fkfpi ] ) as @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "using , e.g. , @xmath146 we obtain @xmath147gev from ( [ beta ] ) and @xmath148 from the mixing relations ( [ mixing ] ) together with eq.([meta2 ] ) and @xmath149 ( see table  [ input ] ) .",
    "a careful analysis of the mass matrix shows that the actual mixing angle in the flavor basis is the one arising from the cosine relation in eq.([sincos ] ) .",
    "this angle is complementary to the one arising from the sine relation , which does not distinguish between @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the mixing angle in the flavor basis thus turns out to lie within the range determined by the case @xmath152 , namely @xmath153 , on the one hand , and the case @xmath146 , namely @xmath154 , on the other hand ( see table  [ input ] ) .",
    "the corresponding angle in the singlet - octet basis is @xmath155 , where @xmath156 results from the ideal mixing angle in the ns  s basis .",
    "the so - determined values of @xmath30 are in the range @xmath157 $ ] and therefore close to zero this finding , in combination with the fact that the sole mixing mechanism of flavor fields is the instanton - induced interaction ( see the left eq.([snsmixing3 ] ) ) , establishes the main result of this section : _ t hooft s instanton - induced interaction mixes strange and non - strange pseudoscalar fields in such a way that one of the physical fields becomes a member of the octet , while the other one becomes an u(3 ) singlet_.    the fact that models 3a and 3b have a non - zero mixing angle is in no contradiction to this as the empirical value(s ) of the mixing angle is used as one of the input parameters . as discussed below , the small deviation from the value zero ( in comparison to the size of the ideal mixing ) should be traced back to subleading contributions , as e.g.  mesonic loops .    if the coefficient @xmath158 in eq.([snsmixing3 ] ) is ignored , the mixing between the _ scalar _ strange and non - strange quarkonia due to t hooft s instanton - induced interaction is predicted to be of the same size as the corresponding mixing in the pseudoscalar sector but with opposite sign .",
    "this is consistent with the results in @xcite . in the _ scalar sector _",
    ", however , one has to account for the additional effect brought about by one of the chiral invariants in eq.([symmlag ] ) whose strength is measured by the above - mentioned @xmath159 coupling as dictated by the right relation of ( [ snsmixing3 ] ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this chiral invariant corresponds to ozi - rule violating disconnected hairpin diagrams .",
    "they represent one out of various examples of subleading ozi - rule violating mechanisms , the most important among them being probably lipkin s non - planar hadronic loops  @xcite : in the scalar sector , the cancellation of hadronic loops is strongly spoiled by parity conservation @xcite .",
    "thus , although subleading and suppressed with respect to instanton contributions , this effect acquires importance as it _ interferes destructively with the instanton - induced contribution to the mixing of the scalar mesons_. this renders the scalars less strongly mixed than pseudoscalars and thus closer to the flavor basis .",
    "estimates based on meson spectrum and on recent data on radiative @xmath160 decays involving scalars yield for the isoscalar - scalar mixing angle @xmath161 $ ] @xcite .",
    "therefore one of the scalar isoscalar mesons ( sigma ) can be nearly identified with the non - strange scalar and is strongly moved down relative to the scalar isovector ( @xmath162 ) as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ snsmixing1 ] , [ unmixedmasses ] ) .",
    "this is also consistent with results in @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the physical properties of mesons , belonging to sectors which are not affected by the instanton - induced interactions , such as the spin-1@xmath163 and tensor @xmath164 mesons , are well described in terms of almost pure flavor states .",
    "the small departure from the flavor basis in these sectors ( @xmath165 ) can be attributed to strong and yet incomplete cancellations of _ all _ meson loops in this sector @xcite .",
    "the same argument can be used for the actual deviation of the @xmath0 from being a pure octet state .",
    "the effect is slightly larger in that case due to incomplete cancellations among hadronic loops @xcite .",
    "the co - existence of strange and non - strange quarkonia in the wave function of the @xmath0 meson raises the question on the @xmath166 creation by the non - strange nucleon   and @xmath167 for the non - strange and strange pseudoscalar fields instead of the notation @xmath168 and @xmath169 of section  [ eightfold ] . ] .",
    "if the ozi rule were unbroken in the pseudoscalar sector , the valence quarks of the non - strange nucleon could not contribute at all .",
    "the only possible direct source for the @xmath170 vertex would be the hidden strangeness of the nucleon , i.e. the existence of small , but non  negligible @xmath171 configurations in the proton wave function , see fig.[ssbar_hidden ] .",
    "the main @xmath172source , however , is the conversion of a non - strange quarkonium , emitted by the valence quarks ( of the nucleon ) , into the strange quarkonium under the influence of the ozi - rule violating instanton effects .",
    "there seem to exist two mechanisms contributing to this conversion .",
    "the first mechanism is displayed in fig.[ssbar_prop ] and has to do with mass terms generated by the anomaly when spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry takes place . in this case",
    "a @xmath173 pair is replaced by its v.e.v and the flavor eigenstates @xmath166 and @xmath174 get mixed  an effect which has been quantified in section  [ eightfold ] in the context of the broken linear sigma model .",
    "the second mechanism , displayed in fig.[ssbar_direct ] , involves a _",
    "direct _ instanton - induced interaction .",
    "finally , less important sources for ( @xmath175 ) quarkonia are non - planar kaon loop diagrams of the type presented in fig.[ssbar_loop ] .",
    "in addition to the @xmath167 production mechanisms mentioned above there exist also contributions from @xmath176 production to the @xmath25 interaction .",
    "these contain the conventional mechanisms with continuous quark lines in addition to instanton - induced interactions involving the hidden strangeness of the nucleon .",
    "clearly , the description of the @xmath25 interaction requires the disentanglement and quantification of all these mechanisms .",
    "this can be accomplished in a natural way in the framework of the model discussed in section  [ eightfold ] . to this end",
    ", we need to study the production of flavor fields from the flavor axial currents which we discuss in the framework of the same model .",
    "the strange and non - strange weak decay constants are defined in the usual way : @xmath177 under the axial transformations @xmath178 with @xmath179 , the lagrangian in eq.([l - model ] ) is not any longer invariant because of the explicit and instanton - induced symmetry breaking terms . a calculation of the divergences of the strange and non - strange axial currents in the model yields : @xmath180 where w stands for the contribution of the instantons and contains trilinear , bilinear and linear terms in the fields .",
    "explicitly @xmath181 taking the derivative of both eqs.([wdc ] ) and then inserting ( [ divcurr ] ) and ( [ w ] ) , we obtain @xmath182 notice that in the case when the anomaly is absent , the masses of both the strange and non - strange fields ( which in this fictitious case are the physical fields ) are solely driven by the explicit breaking terms ( quark mass terms ) .",
    "therefore these fields are genuine pseudo - goldstone boson fields in this case .",
    "this property is spoiled by the anomaly for both fields as can also be seen from the mass relations @xmath183 we will come back to this point below . but first let us insert the relations ( [ m2-extra ] ) in eq.([npcac ] ) , such that the non - strange and strange weak decay constants are determined as @xmath184 these predictions ( see table  [ input ] for the results of models 13b ) can not not be directly compared with the values @xmath185 and @xmath186 from ref .",
    "@xcite , since the definitions are different , especially for @xmath187 and our @xmath188 .",
    "in order to clarify whether the ( octet- ) eta is a pseudo - goldstone boson or not , let us discuss the fictitious case that the explicit breaking ( [ c - equ - set ] ) in the non - strange sector , @xmath107 , is put by hand to zero , but the one in the strange sector is kept finite , @xmath189 . then only the pion remains a goldstone - boson .",
    "the kaon , however , behaves as a pseudo - goldstone boson , since in this case its squared mass is proportional to the explicit breaking @xmath190 .",
    "moreover , the non - vanishing of the ( squared ) @xmath102-meson mass in the @xmath191 limit , @xmath192 , requires that @xmath193 , i.e.  that the v.e.v .  generated by the _",

    "@xmath90 does not need to vanish here , chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and the @xmath3 meson is then a _ pseudo_goldstone boson , although strongly affected by the anomaly .",
    "note that the mass of the @xmath197 meson does not vanish in the last case and therefore the @xmath197 can not become a pseudo - goldstone boson for a non - vanishing ( negative ) @xmath96 and @xmath199 , since in the expression of @xmath200 the analogous square root to the one in eq.([meta_squared ] ) shows the opposite sign .",

    "the @xmath166 and @xmath174 fields are genuine goldstone bosons in this case , and we can assume  without loss of generality  that their interaction with the nucleon follows the derivative structure ( as it has to be the case in the non - linear realization of the pseudoscalar fields in chiral perturbation theory ) @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",

    "these interactions exhibit an octet - like behavior in the case we consider instanton effects during propagation or creation from the vacuum of pseudoscalar fields .",

    "note that the displayed error bars have been calculated solely from the errors @xmath276 of the spin fractions @xmath272 ( which contribute about 7080% of the total error ) , from the error @xmath277 of @xmath278@xcite ( which has to be used here instead of the more precisely determined @xmath279 ) , and from other uncertainties in the input quantities .",
    "further sources of ( systematical ) errors could result from the extrapolation from the @xmath263 point of weak interaction to the mass - shells @xmath139 and @xmath140 of strong interactions , from higher order corrections in the symmetry breaking , from meson - loop corrections , from the neglect of the subleading ozi - rule - violating disconnected hairpin diagrams ( e.g. , from an incomplete cancellation of the non - planar @xmath280 loops ) , and from the neglect of baryon resonances as e.g.  the @xmath281 .",

    "a bound @xmath285 has been deduced which is compatible with the predictions of all our models within error bars .    the significant suppression of the @xmath4 coupling relative the octet goldberger - treiman relation was noticed by several authors , the most recent being , among others refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath286 was evaluated from qcd sum rules beyond the chiral limit and predicted to range from the still relevant value of @xmath287 ( for the @xmath22 limit ) down to the almost complete decoupling of @xmath288 ( beyond the @xmath22 limit ) .",
    "light cone qcd sum rules also lead to the small value of @xmath289 .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath290 was concluded on the basis of recent quark model analyses of meson - photo production data performed in @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we have revealed the nature of the subtle mechanism of the formation of the octet flavor symmetry under the umbrella of the anomaly as reflected by t hooft s effective instanton induced interaction .",
    "our results strongly hint onto the possibility that the reasons for the observed suppression of @xmath1 have to be searched for beyond t hooft s effective interaction .    the naive octet - singlet scheme of eq.([naive - oct - sing ] )",
    "predicts @xmath291 and @xmath292 and @xmath293 for the grein - kroll bound .",
    "note that these results more or less agree with the ones of our model 2 .",
    "this can be justified from the fact that the mixing angle of this model is the closest to the octet ",
    "singlet case , with the exception of model 1 .",
    "the latter , however , features a rather large value of @xmath130 which severely breaks the condition @xmath294 specified above eq.([naive - oct - sing ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the values @xmath295 and @xmath296 of ref.@xcite are calculated with a mixing angle @xmath297 which corresponds to @xmath298 .",
    "thus this result falls between the ones of model 3a and 3b which are fixed by the mixing angles @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "the rule is that the value of @xmath1 increases and the one of @xmath301 decreases with decreasing mixing angle , while the `` grein - kroll - strength '' is nearly constant ( see eqs.([combii ] ) and ( [ combiii ] ) ) .",
    "admittedly , we have used a rather special model in order to analyze the ozi - rule respecting basis of the meson sector and the consequences for the @xmath244-nucleon coupling constants , namely the chirally symmetric @xmath302 _ linear _ sigma model . note , however , that the model - dependence is manifest for the scalar sector , whereas the tree - level predictions of the model in the pseudoscalar sector , under the same input of course , ought to be compatible with pcac arguments or tree - level calculations in chiral perturbation theory , if , and that is the important point , the modifications of the anomaly are properly incorporated into the latter .",
    "furthermore , we have explicitly assumed that the ozi - violation in the isoscalar - pseudoscalar meson sector is governed to leading order by instanton - induced effects rather than by large @xmath303 effects , i.e. that meson loops such as the non - planar ozi - violating diagrams , give a non - zero , but _ subleading _ contribution to this sector .",
    "these points are still controversially discussed in the literature , see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite which favor the instanton interpretation and criticize @xcite and @xcite , respectively ( and vice versa ) , where the large @xmath303 interpretation ( see also @xcite ) and the importance of the non - planar meson - loop contributions is advocated for .    however ,",
    "if we take our assumptions as stated , we find that the mixing of non - strange and strange quarkonia in the wave function of the physical @xmath0 meson induced by the determinantal instanton - induced t  hooft interaction is such that the @xmath0 meson is close to the octet state . therefore , the unitary spin symmetry is more obliged for its existence to the effects of the the axial gluon anomaly than being a fundamental symmetry in its own rights .",
    "the model also allows us to study consequences for the @xmath25 coupling . in two independent calculations , one based on the conventional derivative coupling of the flavor - eigenstates to the nucleon , and the other based on a careful study of the axial vector coupling _ including anomaly contributions _ ( resulting from the t hooft interaction ) to the nucleon , we obtained the magnitude of @xmath1 .",
    "we found it , within error bars , to be stable against changes in the input parameters and in addition , to be be close to the ordinary @xmath22 results . though we obtained our @xmath1 to obey a goldberger - treiman type relation , the latter _ did not _",
    "take its origin from a ( massless ) pole dominance of the induced pseudoscalar form factor .",
    "rather it appeared as a consequence of the subtle effect of instanton induced flavor - mixing _ during propagation _ of the isoscalar pseudoscalars .    in",
    "having clarified the role of the axial gluon anomaly ( as mimicked by t hooft s effective instanton induced interaction ) for manufacturing the octet way , we have established the limits beyond which one has to extend the model in order to describe possible deviations of the @xmath1 value from its octet - gt - value . among the possible candidates for such effects we emphasize the direct meson - instanton coupling of the type of fig.[ssbar_direct ] and the subleading @xmath280 loops of the type of fig.[ssbar_loop ] .",
    "our scheme has the advantage that it allows for possible generalizations to non - ideal mixing angles and different values of the meson decay constants in the strange and non - strange sectors , respectively .",
