    "the existence of exotic mesons beyond @xmath6 has been discussed for 30 years  @xcite , but evidence for such mesons has not been clearly established .",
    "the recently discovered states that have charmonium - like decay modes  @xcite but are difficult to place in the overall charmonium system have introduced challenges to conventional @xmath6 meson model .",
    "the possible interpretations beyond @xmath6 such as hybrid ( @xmath7 ) and four - quark states ( @xmath8 ) have revitalized interest in exotic mesons in the charm sector  @xcite .",
    "so far the observed states involve only @xmath9 quark and light quark ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) decay products , however , the @xmath12 final state is a good channel for an exotic meson search which extends to @xmath9 quark and heavy @xmath13 quark decay products .",
    "an investigation of the @xmath12 system produced in exclusive @xmath2 decays with @xmath14 and @xmath15 is reported in this note .",
    "this analysis is based on a data sample of @xmath16 collisions at @xmath17 with an integrated luminosity of 2.7 @xmath18 collected by the cdf ii detector at the tevatron .",
    "charge conjugate modes are included implicitly in this note .",
    "r0.5        it has been six years since the discovery of @xmath4 , however , the nature of this state has not been clearly understood yet .",
    "due to the closeness of the @xmath4 mass with the threshold of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the @xmath4 has been proposed as a molecule composed of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath4 has also been speculated to be two states nearby , as in some models like the @xmath21 model .",
    "it is critical to make precise measurements of the mass and width of @xmath4 to understand its nature .",
    "the large @xmath5 sample accumulated at cdf enables us to test the hypothesis of that the @xmath4 is composed of two states and to make a precise mass measurement of @xmath4 if it is consistent with one state hypothesis .",
    "r0.5        we first reconstruct @xmath2 signal and then search for structures in the @xmath12 mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22 events are recorded using a dedicated dimuon trigger .",
    "the @xmath2 candidates are reconstructed by combining a @xmath23 candidate , a @xmath15 candidate , and an additional charged track . each track is required to have at least 4 axial silicon hits and have a transverse momentum greater than 400 @xmath24 .",
    "the reconstructed mass of each vector meson candidate must lie within a suitable range from the nominal values ( @xmath2550 @xmath26   for the @xmath27 and @xmath257 @xmath26   for the @xmath28 ) . in the final @xmath29 reconstruction",
    "the @xmath27 is mass constrained , and the @xmath29 candidates must have @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath32 of the mass- and vertex - constrained fit to the @xmath2 candidate is required to be greater than 1% .",
    "r0.5        to suppress combinatorial background , we use @xmath33 and @xmath34 information to identify all three kaons in the final state . the information is summarized in a log - likelihood ratio ( @xmath35 ) , which reflects how well a candidate track can be positively identified as a kaon relative to other hadrons . in addition",
    ", we require a minimum @xmath36 for the @xmath2 candidate , where @xmath36 is the projection onto @xmath37 of the vector connecting the primary vertex to the @xmath38 decay vertex .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath39 requirements for @xmath2 are then chosen to maximize @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number of @xmath2 signal events and @xmath42 is the number of background events implied from the @xmath29 sideband .",
    "the requirements obtained by maximizing @xmath40 are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the invariant mass of @xmath45 , after @xmath27 and @xmath28 mass window requirements , and before and after the minimum @xmath36 and kaon @xmath39 requirements , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , respectively .",
    "we do not see @xmath29 signal at all before the @xmath36 and kaon @xmath39 requirements , but we see clear @xmath29 signal after the requirements .",
    "a fit with a gaussian signal function and a flat background function to the mass spectrum of @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) returns a @xmath29 signal of @xmath46 events .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath39 requirements reduce the background by a factor of approximately 20 000 while keeping a signal efficiency of approximately 20% .",
    "we select @xmath29 signal candidates with a mass within 3@xmath47 of the nominal @xmath29 mass ; the purity of the @xmath29 signal in that mass window is about 80% .",
    "r0.5        the combinatorial background under the @xmath29 peak includes @xmath48 hadron decays such as @xmath49 , in which the pions are misidentified as kaons .",
    "however , background events with misidentified kaons can not yield a gaussian peak at the @xmath29 mass consistent with the 5.9 @xmath26mass resolution .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath50 mass from @xmath51 candidates within @xmath52 of the nominal @xmath29 mass with @xmath48 sidebands subtracted and before applying @xmath28 mass window requirement . using",
    "a smeared @xmath53-wave relativistic breit - wigner ( bw )  @xcite line - shape fit to the spectrum returns a @xmath54 probability of 28% .",
    "this shows that the @xmath55 final state is well described by @xmath56 .",
    "r0.5        we then examine the effects of detector acceptance and selection requirements using @xmath57 mc events simulated by a phase space distribution .",
    "the mc events are smoothly distributed in the dalitz plot and in the @xmath1 mass spectrum .",
    "no artifacts were observed from mc events .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the dalitz plot of @xmath58 versus @xmath59 , and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the mass difference , @xmath60 , for events in the @xmath29 mass window in our data sample .",
    "we examine the enhancement in the @xmath61 spectrum just above @xmath12 threshold .",
    "we exclude the high  mass part of the spectrum beyond @xmath62 @xmath63   to avoid combinatorial backgrounds that would be expected from misidentified @xmath64 decays .",
    "we model the enhancement by an @xmath65-wave relativistic bw function  @xcite convoluted with a gaussian resolution function with the rms fixed to 1.7 @xmath26  obtained from mc , and use three  body phase space  @xcite to describe the background shape .",
    "an unbinned likelihood fit to the @xmath61 distribution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , returns a yield of @xmath66 events , a @xmath61 of @xmath67 , and a width of @xmath68 .",
    "we use the log - likelihood ratio of @xmath69 to determine the significance of the enhancement , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the likelihood values for the null hypothesis fit and signal hypothesis fit .",
    "the @xmath72 value is 5.3 for a pure three ",
    "body phase space background shape assumption .",
    "we generate @xmath61 spectra using the background distribution alone , and search for the most significant fluctuation with @xmath73 in each spectrum in the mass range of 1.02 to 1.56 @xmath63 , with widths in the range of 1.7 ( detector resolution ) to 120 @xmath26  ( ten times the observed width ) .",
    "r0.5        the resulting @xmath74-value from 3.1 million simulations is @xmath75 , corresponding to a significance of 4.3@xmath47 .",
    "we repeat this process with a flat combinatorial non - b background and three  body ps for non - resonance @xmath48 background and we still get a significance of 3.8@xmath47 .",
    "one s eye tends to draw to a second cluster of events around 1.18 @xmath63  in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , or around 4.28 @xmath63  in @xmath12 mass as shown in fig .",
    "it is close to one pion mass above the peak at the @xmath12 threshold .",
    "however , this cluster is statistically insufficient to infer the presence of a second structure . to investigate possible reflections",
    ", we examine the dalitz plot and projections into @xmath76 and @xmath77 spectrum .",
    "we find no evidence for any other structure in the @xmath76 and @xmath77 spectrum .",
    "r0.5        in studying our @xmath4 sample we tested the hypothesis of whether the observed signal stems from two different states , as predicted in four - quark models .",
    "we fit the @xmath4 mass signal with a bw function convoluted with a resolution function  @xcite .",
    "both functions contain a width scale factor that is a free parameter in the fit and therefore sensitive to the shape of the mass signal .",
    "the measured width scale factor is compared to the values seen in pseudo experiments which assume two states with given mass difference and ratio of events .",
    "the resolution in the simulated events is corrected for the difference between data and simulation measured for the @xmath78 .",
    "the result of this hypotheses test shows that the data is completely consistent with a single state . under the assumption of two states with equal amount of observed events",
    ", we set a limit of @xmath79 @xmath26at 90% ( 95% ) c.l .",
    "the limit for other ratios of events in the two peaks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .    since our signal is consistent with one peak , we proceed and measure the x(3872 ) mass in an unbinned maximum likelihood fit .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are determined from the difference between the measured @xmath78 mass and its world average value , the potential variation of the @xmath78 mass as a function of kinematic variables , and the difference in q value between @xmath4 and @xmath78 .",
    "systematic effects due to the fit model are negligible .",
    "the measured @xmath4 mass is : @xmath80 @xmath26 , which is the most precise measurement to date as shown in fig .  [ fig8 ] .",
    "r0.5        the large sample of @xmath57 decays enables us to search for structure in the @xmath12 mass spectrum , and we find evidence for a narrow structure near the @xmath12 threshold with a significance estimated to be at least 3.8@xmath47 . assuming an @xmath65-wave relativistic bw , the mass ( adding @xmath27 mass ) and width of this structure , including systematic uncertainties , are measured to be @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "this structure does not fit conventional expectations for a charmonium state because it is expected to have a tiny br to @xmath12 with its mass well beyond open charm pairs .",
    "we term it the @xmath0 .",
    "the br of @xmath83 is estimated to be @xmath84 .",
    "studies using our @xmath4 sample , the largest in the world , indicate that the @xmath4 is consistent with one state hypothesis and this leads to the most precise mass measurement of @xmath85 based on the one state hypothesis .",
    "the value is below , but within uncertainties of the @xmath86 threshold .",
    "the explanation of the x(3872 ) as a bound d*d system is therefore still an option .",
