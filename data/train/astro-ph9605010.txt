    "over recent years , improvements in spectrographs and detectors have brought forth substantial gains in the quality of observations of absorption features arising from either interstellar gases in front of stars in our galaxy or material in very distant systems in front of quasars .",
    "most modern observations of these features have good signal - to - noise ratios , accurate determinations of the zero intensity level , and sufficient wavelength resolution to break the overall absorption profiles into subcomponents at different doppler shifts .",
    "these advances have allowed us to progress beyond the simple practice of measuring and interpreting just the total equivalent widths of the absorptions .",
    "now , with the ability to discern the added dimension of velocity in the absorption features , an observer is presented with new opportunities for more detailed interpretations . with this expansion , however , come new challenges and responsibilities , ones that extend beyond the framework of analysis techniques that were connected with equivalent widths .    except for features that we are sure must arise from regions with elevated temperatures , we are rarely confident that all of the substructures within the radial velocity peaks have been completely discerned by the spectrograph .",
    "there is evidence that , as a rule , observations taken at successively higher resolutions reveal finer details than those registered before ; good examples can be seen in the interstellar na  i absorption features recorded by wayte , wynne - jones & blades ( 1978 ) , blades , wynne - jones & wayte ( 1980 ) , welty , hobbs & kulkarni ( 1994 ) and barlow , et al .",

    "( 1994 ) and crane , lambert & sheffer ( 1995 ) .",
    "ultimately , the intrinsic dispersion of doppler velocities ( partly thermal , partly turbulent ) may be the only limiting factor in the fineness of the real features . with typical temperatures of cool gas complexes extending below 100k and negligible turbulence , we can expect velocity dispersion parameters @xmath3 that could be as small as 0.2 km  s@xmath4 ( for atoms with a mass of about 40 amu ) , a value that is still significantly narrower than most present - day instrumental profiles .",
    "unfortunately , as we shall see in the discussion that follows , the consequences of instrumental smoothing are more serious than just a loss of velocity detail .",
    "observers must often face the challenge of determining how badly saturated the absorptions were before the smoothing took place .",
    "this is an important step in deriving trustworthy conclusions about the amount of material that caused the absorption .",
    "an observer s ultimate objective is usually to determine not only the total column density @xmath5 of an absorber , but also how the atoms , ions or molecules are distributed over different radial velocities . for the original form of the spectrum @xmath6 that has not been degraded by a convolution with the instrumental profile , the column density as a function of doppler velocity @xmath7 is equal to the absorption feature s optical depth @xmath8 $ ] multiplied by the constant factor @xmath9 (",
    "@xmath10 is the intensity of the unabsorbed continuum ) .",
    "what one observes in actual practice , however , is an apparent intensity @xmath11 that is a smoothed form of the real intensity profile @xmath6 .",
    "even so , as long as the smoothing is not too severe , one can derive an approximate representation that is called the _ apparent _ optical depth @xmath12 $ ] , an interpretative concept first used for high resolution recordings of lines in the visible part of the spectrum by hobbs ( 1971 , 1972 , 1973 , 1974a , b ) and later invoked for uv lines by savage , et al .",

    "more recently , spectra of exceptionally good quality and resolution have been produced by the ghrs echelle spectrograph on the hubble space telescope , and representations of @xmath1 have been important tools for understanding these data ( cardelli et al .",
    "1991 ; savage et al . 1991 ; savage , cardelli , & sofia 1992 ; sofia , savage , & cardelli 1993 ; savage , sembach , & cardelli 1994 ; cardelli & savage 1995 ) .",
    "important properties of @xmath1 have been explained in detail by savage & sembach ( 1991 ) .",
    "the papers cited above have made it clear that apparent optical depths are useful functions for deriving column densities and extracting linear representations for all of the kinematical information that is available .",
    "the information conveyed by the @xmath1 functions represents a significant improvement over the single numbers that signify the equivalent widths of entire profiles or resolved pieces of profiles .",
    "nevertheless , we must be aware of some limitations that arise in certain circumstances ( jenkins et al .",
    "1989 ; joseph & jenkins 1991 ) .",
    "the real physical processes that created the recorded intensities consisted of an exponential attenuation of the light , followed by an instrumental smearing of the spectrum .",
    "the derivation of @xmath1 is an attempt to reconstruct a linear representation for the amount of absorbing material by unraveling the exponential absorption law , but it disregards the convolution by the instrumental profile that followed .",
    "normally , we are accustomed to interpreting functions where there is simply a loss of detail caused by smoothing . but unfortunately @xmath1 does _ not _ represent just a smoothed version of the real @xmath13 . instead , we find that the smoothing has deaccentuated the extremes in @xmath13 , and the nonlinear operation used to construct @xmath1 creates a representation of @xmath13 that is both smoothed _ and distorted_. there are only two circumstances where @xmath1 represents an unbiased reflection of the sought - after distribution : ( 1 ) all of the velocity details of the profile were fully resolved so that @xmath1 is identical to @xmath13 , or ( 2 ) @xmath14 everywhere , so that the @xmath15 $ ] is essentially equivalent to the linear representation @xmath16/i_0 $ ] whose integral over any @xmath17 interval is not changed by the convolution operation . in the first case , all of the information is recovered , while in the second , the only repercussion is a loss of velocity detail .    in short ,",
    "in the course of interpreting @xmath18 an observer must be vigilant about the possible loss of evidence that narrow peaks in absorption are badly saturated .",
    "there is a danger that instrumental smearing has created a picture where the reduction of intensity _ appears _ to be weak and thus far from saturation .",
    "the same argument holds for stronger features .",
    "even if one can sense that some saturation must be evident because the intensity is significantly below the continuum level , smoothing of the bumps could cause one to underestimate its severity and then misjudge the actual amount of material in the line of sight .    a straightforward way to sense and measure the amount of hidden saturation is to observe two or more lines with differing transition probabilities from the same species .",
    "if , at any velocity @xmath19 , the apparent optical optical depths in the smoothed spectra exhibit a scaling that is weaker than the progression of the respective lines @xmath2 values , then there is good reason to believe that in some places the unresolved saturated structures are stronger than a general level suggested by the apparent ( smoothed ) intensity values .",
    "the object of this paper is to demonstrate how one can correct for this effect and derive reasonably accurate representations of column density as a function of velocity .",
    "the method to be outlined has a relationship with the conventional curve of growth analysis for equivalent widths that is stronger than just a simple analogy .",
    "as the arguments in  [ concepts ] will show , the two methods have nearly identical mathematical foundations .",
    "the principal advantage of correcting @xmath1 rather than @xmath0 is that we do not sacrifice the information contained in velocity peaks that can be resolved .",
    "hence one can explore , for instance , how the abundances of different species change with velocity , rather than just determining the overall abundance ratios at all velocities within some large complex of components .    in their instructive overview on how to derive ,",
    "interpret and exploit the apparent optical depths of interstellar features , savage & sembach ( 1991 ) likewise addressed the problem of how to cope with the misrepresentations of the real optical depth levels caused by instrumental smearing .",
    "they proposed that one should measure the disparity in inferred column densities _ integrated over velocity _ for two lines and then apply , according to a specific prescription , a global , multiplicative ( upward ) correction to the entire profile of the weaker line .. ] the method advocated here uses a different approach that is an improvement over the one described by sembach & savage .",
    "corrections are applied on the spot at individual velocities , without regard to what is happening elsewhere .",
    "the two methods will be compared in  [ comparison ] .",
    "a very different tactic for analyzing saturated , blended features is to build a model of the real absorption complex by defining such parameters as the strengths , widths and velocity centroids of individual components ( vidal - madjar et al .",
    "1977 ; ferlet et al . 1980 ; welsh , vedder , & vallerga 1990 ; hobbs & welty 1991 ; welsh et al .",

    "one then solves ( or searches ) for a minimum in the @xmath20 values as parameters for the theoretical representation of the instrumentally blended complex are compared with the observations . in cases where independent information can help to constrain the choice of free parameters ( such as much higher resolution observations of other species ) , this method can be successful .",
    "while such model building has the potential of helping us to understand some details that may not be evident in a display of smoothed optical depths , it has the disadvantage of usually relying on human judgement to define the constraints on the parameters and the method of converging to a minimum @xmath20 .",
    "also , the models contain specific assumptions about the functional forms of the components , with the usual choice being a gaussian ( or voigt ) profile .",
    "by contrast , the derivation of @xmath1 is a simple , mechanical process that places no such requirements on the investigator and does not rely on any specific models , even when the corrections discussed later in this paper are implemented .",
    "for the purposes of discussion , we shall address the problem of working with the optical depths of two lines that have values of @xmath2 that differ by a factor of 2 .",
    "this situation is frequently encountered in astronomical spectroscopy , such as when the strong @xmath21 resonance doublets of lithium - like atoms and ions are observed .",
    "the arguments apply equally well to other line strength ratios , within reasonable limits that are set by errors that arise either from noise or systematic measurement problems .    in  [ single_line ] below , we start with a trivial example of how to analyze a single gaussian profile . in sections that follow ,",
    "we make use of some simple theorems to address progressively more complex situations , ending up with arbitrarily strong profiles with very complicated shapes .      before approaching the problem of correcting optical depths",
    ", we should first review the basic principles of the doublet ratio method ( unsld , struve , & elvey 1930 ; beals 1936 ; wilson & merrill 1937 ; strmgren 1948 ) , a classical analysis that is applied to the equivalent widths of the two members of a doublet . strictly speaking , the analysis is correct only for a voigt intensity profile created by a gaussian 1-dimensional velocity distribution ( or two or more such profiles caused by _",
    "identical _ , well separated gaussian components ) . in practical situations where there is no better choice",
    ", it is customary for investigators to make the implicit assumption that the velocity structure of the absorbing material is very similar to that of a single gaussian . when a line is optically thin",
    "everywhere @xmath22 however when there is enough material and a low enough velocity dispersion @xmath3 to make the lines saturated , any line with a central optical depth @xmath23[tau0 ] should have an equivalent width given by @xmath24 where @xmath25dx \\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\pi^{1/2}\\over 2}\\sum^\\infty_{n=1}{(-1)^{n-1}\\tau_0^n \\over n!n^{1/2}}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the ratio @xmath26 of the doublet s two equivalent widths , one can calculate a correction factor @xmath27 that would be needed to enhance the weaker line s @xmath0 so that eq .",
    "[ thin ] for low optical depths would apply .",
    "( in this case , @xmath28 is the central optical depth of the weak line and the factor 2 in eq .",
    "[ r ] reflects the ratio of the two lines @xmath2 values . )",
    "now that the concept of doublet ratio corrections has been introduced , we move on to address how we would operate with the two @xmath18 functions instead of just a pair of numbers representing the absorption over all velocity , i.e. , the two @xmath0 s .",
    "again , we consider an observation of moderately saturated lines in a ( 2:1 ) doublet , where the column density of the absorber has a velocity distribution that is a single gaussian and the feature has a central optical depth @xmath28 for the weaker line .    in the limit where the instrumental profile is very much broader than the widths of the lines ,",
    "the two smoothed absorption functions @xmath29/i_0 $ ] have several important properties .",
    "first , they have shapes that are virtually identical to the instrumental smearing function and areas equal to the lines equivalent widths .",
    "second , by virtue of the fact that the extreme smearing has degraded the amplitudes of these functions so that their peak values are very much less than one , they are close approximations to the @xmath18 functions .",
    "it then follows that at every @xmath19 the ratios of the two lines @xmath18 s are identical to the ratio of the equivalent widths .",
    "if we now take this ratio @xmath30 and solve eqs .  [ ftau0 ] and",
    "[ r ] to find @xmath28 , we may derive the correction factor from eq .",
    "[ c ] and evaluate @xmath5 according to @xmath31 where here @xmath32 replaces @xmath33 in the usual equation for deriving @xmath5 from the integral of a true optical depth over all velocity . while this cumbersome procedure for obtaining @xmath5 is mathematically equivalent to invoking the doublet ratio method on equivalent widths , it serves as a trivial but good introductory illustration of the principle of correcting @xmath18 .",
    "if we move to the opposite extreme of having a smearing function that is much narrower than the velocity spread of @xmath33 , we find that @xmath18 of the strong line is always twice the value of @xmath18 of the weak line because @xmath18 is practically identical to the true @xmath33 . here , one would obtain @xmath5 by evaluating eq .",
    "[ n ] with @xmath34 .    in the two preceding extreme cases of very poor and very good resolution , @xmath35 does not change with @xmath19 . in the intermediate case",
    "where the line is only partly degraded by instrumental smearing , both @xmath30 and @xmath35 vary .",
    "( henceforth , we will work with a modified notation @xmath36 and @xmath37 as a reminder that these quantitites change with velocity ) . also , it is no longer possible to show by elementary arguments that a point - by - point correction will indeed make eq .",
    "[ n ] work .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations indicate that for a single gaussian with @xmath38 for the weak line , eq .",
    "[ n ] overestimates @xmath5 by 4% in the worst possible case of intermediate resolution .. ]      we now consider the problem of analyzing several gaussian profiles that are blended together by the instrument , but that are actually well separated from each other in the absence of such blending .",
    "the key to solving this problem relies on an interesting property of the combined strengths of saturated lines noted by jenkins ( 1986 ) .",
    "he demonstrated that the application of a curve of growth ( or doublet ratio ) analysis to a sum of the equivalent widths of an ensemble of gaussian profiles , while technically an incorrect procedure , still gives an answer for the sum of @xmath5 over all of the contributions that is usually only slightly below the correct value .",
    "the method works satisfactorily even when there is a significant dispersion in the @xmath28 and @xmath3 values for the separate components .",
    "for example , when the doublet ratio analysis is tried on the two sums of equivalent widths of population of lines that have an average central optical depth for the weak line @xmath39 but with an rms dispersion of 40% for the individual @xmath28 s and @xmath3 s , the standard calculation for the total value of @xmath5 should , on average , be equal to 94% of the true value .",
    "lower values for either @xmath40 or the dispersion of @xmath28 give results that are closer to the true one .",
    "the only condition where the analysis breaks down seriously is when the distribution of @xmath28 or @xmath3 is markedly bimodal ( or when there are so few components that small - number statistical fluctuations may be important ) .    from the findings presented in the above paragraph and reasoning given in ",
    "[ single_line ] , we can see that a severely underresolved recording of a sparse cluster of saturated gaussian profiles can be treated in the same manner as a single gaussian .",
    "once again , we evaluate the correction factor @xmath37 everywhere , and , through the use of eq .",
    "[ n ] , obtain the column density for the entire group .",
    "this argument applies even if the cluster of features spans a velocity interval that is much larger than the instrumental profile . in this case , the value of @xmath18 at any point represents simply a weighted sum of the equivalent widths of a bunch of lines on either side of @xmath19 .",
    "the derived differential value of @xmath5 at this velocity will reflect , with reasonable accuracy , the amount of material present in these components , after their contributions have been multiplied by the same weight factors .    as with the single gaussian ,",
    "an observation that fully resolves the individual components will yield @xmath41 everywhere , with the outcome that @xmath18 needs no upward correction because it is virtually the same as @xmath33 . only in the case where the resolving power is roughly comparable to the line widths",
    "do we face the prospect of having a mild inaccuracy in the answer .",
    "suppose that we now enhance the absorption of the sparse complex of lines by adding many new components , all of which have the same population characteristics as before .",
    "if the complex s velocity span remains constant , we could reach a point where the lines start to overlap each other .",
    "going still further , new components could be added to the point that they pile on top of each other many times over .",
    "we are now presented with an overall absorption profile that is very complex and , on average , with a depth @xmath42 that could now be a very significant fraction of the continuum level @xmath10 .    in real life",
    ", if there are no coherent physical processes that can have a dynamical influence on the radial velocities of the components , one can expect the small - scale placement of the components velocity centroids to be random .",
    "when this is the case , the average optical depth will grow in direct proportion to the density of components per unit velocity .",
    "in essence , beer s law is operating on the average amount of flux that is permitted to penetrate a random superposition of absorbers .",
    "this behavior insures that @xmath18 will continue to represent , within the instrument s passband centered on @xmath19 , a ( weighted ) sum of equivalent widths of the components , i.e. , the @xmath0 s that would have been accumulated in the absence of any mutual obstruction of the lines .",
    "the situation here is therefore no different than that presented in ",
    "[ sparse_cluster ] , except that the @xmath18 s are no longer much less than 1 .",
    "it follows from the proportionality of line density to average optical depth that the evolution of a given population of components from a sparse to a dense cluster has no effect on either @xmath36 or the factor @xmath37 that is needed to boost the equivalent widths ( and hence @xmath18 ) to a value that approximately represents the smoothed @xmath33 .",
    "now that the basic principles of correcting @xmath18 have been presented , it is appropriate to create some test cases that demonstrate how the method works .",
    "two examples will be offered .",
    "the first will consist of a 60 km  s@xmath4 wide complex of mostly saturated gaussian lines , all different from each other , whose narrowest members are distributed sparsely enough to create only occasional overlaps .",
    "the second example will contain a much denser collection with many more such lines .",
    "the second example will have a density of components per unit velocity that is large enough to cause a substantial compounding of absorptions at most velocities .",
    "these two examples are tailored to illustrate the principles discussed in   [ sparse_cluster ] and   [ dense_cluster ] , respectively .",
    "certain properties of the line complexes were contrived to serve a useful pedagogical purpose , but at some expense in realism .",
    "for instance , fig .  [ population ] shows the values of central optical depths and velocity dispersions of components as a function of their location ( velocity ) within the dense absorption complex .",
    "( the sparse complex is just a small subset from the same general population . ) in both cases , the complexes were constructed such that the average central optical depths @xmath40 decreased from left to right , while at the same time the average velocity widths @xmath43 increased to make the product @xmath44 constant over the entire velocity span .",
    "one could imagine this absorption complex arising from some fictitious case where a heterogeneous collection of interstellar clouds had a steady increase in kinetic temperature as the radial velocities progressed from 0 to 60  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "within any small velocity interval , the dispersions of @xmath28 and @xmath3 were constructed to be equal to 40% of their mean values ( but with a cutoff at @xmath45 to prevent negative or inordinately low values ) .",
    "the top two panels ( _ a _ and _ b _ ) in fig .",
    "[ examplex ] show the original , fully resolved intensities of the weak transition for the sparse and dense ensembles , before they were smoothed by an instrumental profile that consists of a gaussian with a fwhm = 2  km  s@xmath4 . immediately below these panels",
    "are the smoothed forms for both the strong and weak lines .",
    "the intensities are converted to apparent optical depths and shown in the next row of panels . in both cases , the last pair of panels",
    "show that the ratios @xmath36 of the two optical depths progress in a somewhat irregular fashion from about 1.2 on the left hand side to about 1.9 on the right .",
    "the fluctuations on top of the general trend are caused by random changes in the relative mix of lines with different degrees of saturation .",
    "at each velocity @xmath19 , we measure @xmath36 , the ratio of the strong line s @xmath18 to that of the weak one , and derive @xmath37 by solving eqs .",
    "[ r ] and [ c ] ( a streamlined way of directly computing @xmath37 will be presented in   [ analytical ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ outcomes ] . on the left hand side where the individual components are narrow and saturated , @xmath18 ( shown by the dotted line ) is significantly below a smoothed version of the true optical depth @xmath33 ( solid line ) . toward the right ,",
    "the individual components become less saturated but broader , and this reduces the disparity . note , however , that apart from small - scale random fluctuations , a running average of the true optical depths ( and hence column density ) does not systematically change from left to right .    after multiplying @xmath18 by @xmath37",
    ", we obtain a corrected optical depth ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ outcomes ] ) that is a good approximation to the smoothed @xmath33 ( solid line  the function that we are attempting to reconstruct so that we can derive the column density per unit velocity ) .",
    "the difference between the two is shown by the filled - in curve associated with a baseline that is displaced vertically to a plot @xmath46 value of @xmath471.5 . in the sparse line case ,",
    "this error is always less than 0.1 dex , as indicated by the thickness of the black filling . for the dense line example",
    ", this error occasionally becomes of order 0.1 dex .",
    "these errors are significantly less than the gross underestimates for the smoothed @xmath33 that arise from the raw values of @xmath18 , as shown by the filled - in curve above the baseline situated at @xmath472.3 in the two panels of the figure .",
    "it is important to realize , however , that these tests are being performed under conditions where there is absolutely no noise or systematic errors in defining either a continuum level or zero intensity baseline . under the circumstances of real observing",
    ", one would need to assess the impact of these errors on the reliability of the results .",
    "in the preceding section we have examined the performance of the optical depth correction technique on a broad expanse of many randomly situated gaussian profiles .",
    "it is also useful to test the method on a small clump of a few such profiles .",
    "some test examples constructed by savage & sembach ( 1991 ) are suitable for this purpose .",
    "their six cases range in complexity from a single gaussian ( their case  1 ) to a group of 6 components ( their case  6 ) that overlap and have values of @xmath28 and @xmath3 that differ by factors of 5 ( see their table  2 for details ) .",
    "we also wish to examine how well total column densities derived from the on - the - spot corrections discussed here compare with the simple global correction scheme discussed by savage & sembach .",
    "basically , they proposed that the total column density ( in contrast to the column density per unit velocity ) be compensated according to the disparities of apparent column densities from the two lines .",
    "it is clear that their technique would be inappropriate for certain configurations , such as the two highly contrived cases presented in  [ demo ] or certain real observations [ e.g. , such as the fe  ii absorption lines in the spectrum of @xmath48  sco shown by joseph & jenkins ( 1991 ) ] . for the demonstration examples in  [ demo ] , a correction for the left hand side would not work for the right hand side where practically no correction is needed .",
    "however , in some more realistic situations where just a few saturated and unsaturated components are mixed together , the story might be different .",

    "the analysis method proposed in this paper has a special virtue , in that it avoids the requirement for model building : one is not forced to try to reconstruct exactly what profiles should have looked like before they were smoothed by the instrument .",

    "it is not easy to give guidelines here on these issues , since there are so many possibilities .",
    "a formal evaluation of how the errors can propagate through the mathematical transformations can give some guidance .",
    "this sort of error analysis combined with common sense are probably the best tools for judging the reliability of the final results",
    ".    one must be wary of the trap where a disproportionately large fraction of the gas is located in very narrow features that are fully saturated in both lines , but where most of the absorption is caused by high - velocity fluff that is unsaturated .",
    "this condition is especially likely to arise when there is a bimodal distribution in the widths and strengths of the components in the ensemble .",
    "one should be alert for physical circumstances that could produce this state , such as lines of sight that have the right mixture of contributions from cold h  i and much hotter h  ii regions , cases where both quiescent and shock - accelerated gases are present , or , when one is looking through entire galaxies , there is a mixture of disk and halo gases .",
