    "we have promoted the use of the pairwise mem to fmri data during rest @xcite and sleep @xcite and then developed an energy landscape analysis method and applied it to participants during rest @xcite and during a bistable visual perception task @xcite . in the present paper ,",

    "the vertical position of the endpoint of the leaf represents its energy value , which specifies the frequency of appearance , with a lower position corresponding to a higher frequency .",

    "[ fig : schematic]e , the brain dynamics have to overcome the height of the energy barrier ( shown by the dotted arrow ) .",
    "if the barrier is high , transitions between the two activity patterns occur with a low frequency .",
    "the disconnectivity graph is obtained by the following procedures .",
    "first , we enumerate local minimums , i.e. , the activity patterns whose energy is smaller than all neighbors .",
    "then , for a given pair of local minimums @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we consider a path connecting them , @xmath96 , where a path is a sequence of activity patterns starting from @xmath94 and ending at @xmath95 such that any two consecutive activity patterns on the path are neighboring patterns .",

    "the two measures of the accuracy indices are shown in table  [ tb : accuracy ] for each network and estimation method .",
    "the two indices took the same value in the case of likelihood maximization @xcite . in the case of pseudo - likelihood maximization , the two accuracy indices were slightly different from each other , and both took approximately the same values as those derived from maximum likelihood . in the case of the minimum probability flow ,",

    "the two synchronized activity patterns , i.e. , the activity patterns with all rois being active or inactive were local minimums .",
    "the fpn had much more local minimums than the dmn and con did .",
    "although the present results are opposite to our previous results using a different data set @xcite , the reason for the discrepancy is unclear .",
    "our experiences suggest that , as the number of roi , @xmath0 , increases , the pairwise mem seems to demand a large amount of data to realize a high accuracy .",
    "if we use @xmath0 rois , there are @xmath11 possible activity patterns .",
    "therefore , as we increase @xmath0 , it is progressively likely that many of the activity patterns are unvisited .",
    "however , the mem assigns a positive probability to such an unvisited pattern . even if an activity pattern @xmath91 is realized by the empirical data a few times , the empirical distribution , @xmath132 , would not be reliable because it is evaluated only based on a few visits to @xmath91 ( divided by @xmath4 ) . if @xmath4 is much larger and @xmath91 is visited proportionally many times",

    "we applied the methods to fmri data collected from healthy participants and assessed the amount of data needed to secure a sufficient accuracy of fit .",
    "the present results suggest that the current method is admittedly demanding in terms of the amount of data , although the results should be corroborated with different data sets . in the application of the pairwise mem to neuronal spike trains ,",
    "the data length does not seem to pose a severe limit if the network size , @xmath0 , is comparable to those in the present study .",
    "this is because one typically uses a high time resolution to ensure that there is no multiple spikes within a time window ( e.g. , 2 ms @xcite , 10 ms @xcite , 20 ms @xcite ) .",
