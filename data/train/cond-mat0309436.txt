    "in large complex networks , not all nodes are equivalent . for example",
    ", the removal of a node can have a very different effect depending on the node .",
    "if the node is at a dead - end , its removal will be without any effect in contrast with the case of a cut - vertex ( the analog of a bridge for edges ) which removal creates new disconnected components@xcite .",
    "this question of the importance of nodes in a network is thus of primary interest since it concerns crucial subjects such as networks resilience to attacks@xcite and also immunization against epidemics@xcite . in social network analysis ,",
    "this problem of determining the rank  or the `` centrality''of the actors according to their position in the social structure was studied a long time ago@xcite .",
    "different quantities were then defined in this context of social networks in order to quantify this centrality .",
    "the simplest proxy for centrality one could think of is the connectivity .",
    "however , the inspection of a simple example such as the one in fig .  [ simple_example ] shows that centrality is in general not related to connectivity .",
    "the reason is that connectivity is a local quantity which does not inform about the importance of the node in the network .",
    "indeed , the node @xmath7 in fig",
    ".  1 has a small connectivity and the effect of its removal is not determined by its connectivity but by the fact that it links together different parts of the network .",
    "a good measure of the centrality of a node has thus to incorporate a more global information such as its role played in the existence of paths between any two given nodes in the network .",
    "one is thus naturally led to the definition of the betweenness centrality ( bc ) which counts the fraction of shortest paths going through a given node .",
    "more precisely , the bc of a node @xmath7 is given by@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the total number of shortest paths from node @xmath10 to node @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the number of shortest paths from @xmath10 to @xmath11 going through @xmath7 . in the following",
    "we will also use the pair - dependency defined as@xcite @xmath13 the betweenness centrality @xmath14 scales as the number of pairs of nodes ( @xmath15 ) and some authors rescale it by @xmath16 in order to get a number in the interval @xmath17 $ ] ( @xmath18 is the number of nodes in the giant component of the network ) . a naive algorithm for computing",
    "@xmath14 would lead to a complexity of order @xmath19 and would thus be prohibitive for large networks . fortunately a rapid algorithm was recently proposed@xcite which reduces the complexity to @xmath20 allowing the computation of the centrality for large networks .",
    "= 0.45    the definition ( [ def_bc ] ) is indeed a good description of centrality as can be easily seen on the example of figure  [ simple_example ] .",
    "the bc of the node @xmath7 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the number of nodes in region @xmath24",
    "( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the first equality comes from the fact that the term for which @xmath10 and @xmath11 are in the same region does not contribute since in this case @xmath26 .",
    "this result shows that although @xmath7 has a small connectivity , its bc defined by ( [ def_bc ] ) is large as intuitively expected .",
    "this little argument prefigures the more general one about centrality for trees ( see below ) .",
    "high values of the centrality thus indicate that a node can reach the others on short paths or that this vertex lies on many short paths .",
    "if one removes a node with large centrality it will lengthen the paths between many pairs of nodes .",
    "the extreme case is when the node is a cut - vertex@xcite and its removal creates new connected components .",
    "this was for example used in@xcite to determine recursively different communities in large networks .",
    "there are other centrality indices based on shortest paths linking pairs of nodes ( stress , closeness , or graph centrality@xcite ) . in order to take into account the fact that shortest paths are not always relevant ,",
    "other definitions were introduced such as the flow betweenness@xcite and recently a betweenness centrality based on random walks@xcite . this definition ( [ def_bc ] ) differs from the following one which includes the paths endpoints @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath27 ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 can be @xmath7 ) .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath28 this additional term @xmath29 is sub - dominant since @xmath30 and is thus negligible in the limit of large networks leading to the same results for both definitions ( for a typical value of the order @xmath31 , the relative difference for large connectivities is negligible  of order @xmath32but could be larger for lower @xmath33 ) . in this work ,",
    "we use the definition ( [ def_bc ] ) and restrict ourselves to non - weighted and non - directed graphs .",
    "we will rescale the bc by @xmath16 so that @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "we will keep the same notation @xmath14 for this normalized centrality .",
    "it has been observed@xcite that large networks can be essentially classified in two categories according to the decay of the connectivity distribution @xmath35 .",
    "the first category comprises the `` exponential '' networks with a connectivity distribution decaying faster than any power law ( random graph , poisson graph , etc ) . in contrast , the second category is constituted by the `` scale - free '' networks which have a probability distribution decaying as a power law characterized by an exponent @xmath3 @xmath36 for these networks , there are no typical nodes since the connectivity can vary over a large range of values . in this sense ,",
    "scale - free networks are very heterogeneous compared to exponential networks for which connectivity fluctuations are small .    in the following",
    ", we will investigate the bc for networks which are simple models representative of each class .      in the case of scale - free networks , goh et al",
    "have presented a numerical study of the bc ( or `` load '' ) distribution in a static scale - free network model @xcite . for this scale - free model ,",
    "the exponent @xmath372,\\infty[$ ] is a tunable parameter .",
    "they also studied the scale - free model obtained by preferential attachment@xcite for which @xmath38 .",
    "they showed that the bc is distributed according to a power - law with exponent @xmath4 @xcite @xmath39 this behavior holds for large @xmath14 up to a cut - off value which is controlled by finite - size effects . on the basis of their numerical results , they conjectured that the value of @xmath40 is `` universal '' for all values of @xmath372,3]$ ] .",
    "universality is usually invoked in physics when different systems show the same behavior@xcite .",
    "for example many of the observed second order phase transitions have a behavior which depends only on the dimension of the system and the symmetry of the order parameter . in terms of the renormalization group ,",
    "all these systems are described by the same fixed point of the renormalization group transformation and their critical exponents are then equal . in the case of networks , goh et",
    "al@xcite measured the exponent @xmath4 for different real - world and in silico systems and found only two classes@xcite : either @xmath40 ( class i ) or @xmath41 ( class ii ) . according to these numerical findings",
    ", they claimed that there is `` universality '' and that networks could be classified according to the value of @xmath4 .",
    "this means that within a given class , @xmath4 is independent of the details of the network such as the mean connectivity @xmath42 , or the exponent @xmath3 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is however not universal@xcite and varies significantly as @xmath3 changes in the interval @xmath432,3]$ ] or as @xmath44 varies . in order to see this non - universality",

    "= 0.45    the variations of @xmath4 obtained with @xmath46 are significant enough to claim that it is not a universal exponent but in order to double - check our results we can also use an indirect way of computing @xmath4 .",
    "we study the relation between the load and the connectivity@xcite which is of the form @xmath47 where the exponent @xmath0 depends on the network .",
    "this relation ( between two random variables ) implies that for a given value of @xmath33 , the corresponding value @xmath48 of the centrality is fixed . due to noise such as finite - size effects",

    "in addition , we tested the universality for different values of @xmath44 and we also obtain variations ruling it out : for @xmath51 and for @xmath63 , we obtain @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 respectively .",
    "even if goh et al have recently shown@xcite with a variant of the ba model that for @xmath67 $ ] , the exponent @xmath4 is close to @xmath68 for other models supposed to be within the same universality class ( ba model , static model , etc . )",
    ", the exponent @xmath4 varies with @xmath44 or @xmath3 and is therefore not universal .",
    "we also note in figure  [ univ ] that for larger values of @xmath3 , the exponent @xmath0 seems to converge to the value @xmath1 .",
    "this seems to show that for an exponential network , formally characterized by @xmath69 , the exponent @xmath0 is equal to two .",
    "we will discuss this fact in more details below .    finally , the case @xmath70 for the preferential attachment is special in the sense that the obtained scale - free network is a tree .",
    "exact calculations in this case@xcite show that @xmath71 .",
    "we will see below that the value @xmath1 is in fact expected for any tree and that @xmath41 is the expected value for a scale - free tree only with @xmath38 .",
    "= 0.45      we have seen different examples of scale - free networks in the previous section and we focus now on the random graph@xcite ( often called erdos - renyi graph ) which is a typical example of exponential networks for which the connectivity distribution is decaying at least as fast as an exponential .",
    "this network is constructed as follows .",
    "starting from @xmath18 nodes , one connects with probability @xmath72 each pair of nodes .",
    "the average final number of edges is thus @xmath73 and the average connectivity is @xmath74 for large graphs .",
    "more generally , the probability that a node has connectivity @xmath33 is given by the binomial law @xmath75 which converges to a poisson law of parameter @xmath76 for large @xmath18 and small @xmath72 such that @xmath77 is fixed .",
    "we studied the centrality for this network and in fig .",
    "[ bc_er ] we plot the measured bc versus the connectivity .",
    "even if the connectivity is not varying over a very large range , this plot shows that for large @xmath33 we have @xmath1 .",
    "we will discuss this result in more details below but we already note that the random graph has a very small clustering coefficient @xmath78 ( @xmath79 counts the average fraction of pairs of connected neighbors@xcite ) and that this property could possibly be related to the fact that @xmath1 .",
    "the results obtained above show that the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath4 are not universal and depend on the details of the network .",
    "in particular , if the network is scale - free ( tree - like or not ) @xmath4 depends on the exponent @xmath3 which describes the power law decay of the connectivity distribution .",
    "the important exponent appears to be @xmath0 which describes how the betweenness centrality depends on the connectivity .",
    "the `` optimal '' situation which maximizes the bc for a vertex is obtained when all shortest paths are going through it , which happens for a tree structure ( ie . a network without loops ) .",
    "to this optimal tree situation corresponds the maximum value of @xmath1 . in order to show this ,",
    "we first define some objects .",
    "if a vertex @xmath7 has connectivity @xmath33 , we denote by @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) its @xmath33 neighbors .",
    "each neighbor @xmath80 defines a `` neighborhood '' @xmath82 constituted by nodes which are closer to this neighbor than to any other one .",
    "more formally , @xmath82 is defined as follows @xmath83 when the equality of distances @xmath84 is obtained for some @xmath85 then the node @xmath10 belongs to the two neighborhoods @xmath82 and @xmath86 .",
    "the existence of a non empty intersection between different neighborhoods allows for the possibility of paths by - passing the node @xmath7 .    in the following",
    "we denote by @xmath87 the size of each region @xmath82 .",
    "in general the shortest paths from @xmath88 to @xmath89 go through @xmath7 or avoid @xmath7 by using paths on nodes belonging to @xmath90 [ see fig .",
    "[ comm ] ] .",
    "if the two nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 belong to the same neighborhood , say @xmath91 , there is always a shortest path within @xmath91 ( in the worst case the shortest path goes through @xmath92 but not through @xmath7 ) and therefore @xmath93 in terms of these neighborhoods @xmath82 , the bc can be rewritten as @xmath94 ( the term @xmath95 gives zero ) .    for a tree",
    ", these regions @xmath82 are disconnected one from the other and the bc can then be rewritten as @xmath96 if in addition these different parts are of the same order of magnitude @xmath97 ( which is similar to a statistical isotropy condition ) we obtain @xmath98 which for large @xmath33 behaves as @xmath99 leading to the value @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , the `` isotropy '' condition @xmath100 is necessary and if it is not satisfied then the preceding argument does not apply@xcite .",
    "we note that an exactly solvable model for which this assumption is satisfied is the tree graph obtained with the ba model with @xmath70 and where one indeed finds @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the tree situation miximizes the bc since all shortest paths are going through the node @xmath7 . in any other cases ,",
    "the centrality will be less and the maximum possible value of @xmath0 is @xmath101 .",
    "more generally , if for a network the density of loops is small enough such that most shortest paths which go from @xmath82 to @xmath86 have to go through @xmath7 then we obtain @xmath1 .",
    "this is the case for trees but also for random graphs for which the clustering is small @xmath102 .",
    "if in addition to be a tree , the network is scale - free we can use the relation ( [ rel_expo ] ) which together with @xmath1 leads to @xmath103 this relation in particular implies that for the scale - free ba network with @xmath70 and @xmath38 , we obtain @xmath104 in agreement with previous results@xcite . it should be noted that in both these papers@xcite the authors demonstrate that @xmath41 in the specific case of preferential attachment .",
    "however , in@xcite , the authors claim that their result is valid for any scale - free tree with @xmath105 .",
    "this is an incorrect statement since their derivation is only valid for preferential attachment and in general @xmath4 depends on @xmath3 as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ treesf ] ) .    on the other hand  and",
    "this is the second possible category of networks ",
    "if there is a significant fraction of shortest paths which by - pass @xmath7 then the exponent @xmath0 will be less than @xmath101 .",
    "if the network is scale - free then we can use the relation ( [ rel_expo ] ) which together with @xmath2 leads to the exact bound @xmath106    the quantity @xmath107 is thus a measure of the density of loops in the network . the fact that @xmath2 indicates that the different parts are also connected by shortest paths which do not pass through the central node .",
    "more generally , it would be interesting to understand how @xmath0 depends on the different parameters of the network such as @xmath3 , the clustering coefficient , the loop density , the `` anisotropy '' , or any other correlation function .    in summary",
    ", it seems that concerning the betweenness centrality , we can distinguish two main categories .",
    "for the first one which comprises the trees and tree - like networks ( clustering almost zero , density of loops very small ) , we have @xmath1 .",
    "if in addition , the tree is scale - free with exponent @xmath3 , we have the relation @xmath6 .",
    "the second category comprises the networks for which the density of loops is large enough so that the networks are very different from trees . in this case , the exponents @xmath108when they exist  are not universal and depend on the different details ( average connectivity , correlations , etc ) .",
    "if this `` clustered '' network is scale - free with exponent @xmath3 , the exponent @xmath4 must obey an exact bound [ eq .  ( [ bound ] ) ] . although we believe that the present picture is the correct one , further studies are still necessary to understand which are exactly the parameters which control the behavior of @xmath0 . in this respect , analytical insights would be particularly valuable .",
