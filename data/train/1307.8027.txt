    "the presence of a photon component in the ultra - high - energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays is an important open question in astroparticle physics .",
    "an answer to it will give information on astrophysical issues such as the composition and origin of the uhe cosmic rays , as well as on the fundamental topic of possible modifications of the space - time symmetries@xcite .",
    "in the standard physical picture , a primary uhe photon reaching the earth interacts in the atmosphere and produces an extensive air shower of particles with lower energies that can be detected by the ground - based experiments .",
    "the characteristics of the shower are sensitive to the altitude , at which the first interaction giving rise to the shower takes place .",
    "this , in its turn , is determined by the cross section of the first interaction . at energies @xmath1",
    "the dominant channel of the first interaction is electron - positron pair production on nuclei in the atmosphere , the so - called bethe - heitler process@xcite . at higher energy ( @xmath2 and above ) the pair production in the geomagnetic field",
    "becomes important leading to the formation of a preshower above the atmosphere .",
    "the photon showers initiated by these processes can be identified by the cosmic ray detectors using various observables .    the cross section of the first interaction , and consequently the characteristics of the shower , may be affected by new physics . in this paper",
    "we study the influence of possible violation of the lorentz invariance ( or lorentz violation ( lv ) for short ) on the aforementioned processes , and the bounds on lv parameters that can be established if the uhe photons are detected .",
    "to make the quantitative predictions we study the model of lv quantum electrodynamics with the following lagrangian : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are dimensionless parameters , the covariant derivative @xmath6 is defined in the standard way , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the planck mass . summation over repeated indices with minkowski metrics is understood .",
    "this lagrangian contains all inequivalent operators of dimension up to 6 that are rotationally invariant in the preferred frame , gauge invariant , and cpt- and p - even .",
    "the requirements on the theory and their motivation are discussed in detail in ref . .",
    "from the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) one obtains the dispersion relations for photons and electrons / positrons , @xmath9 also the feynman rules for the model ( [ lagr ] ) are modified compared to the lorentz invariant case@xcite . for processes with an electron - positron pair in the final state one introduces the combination @xmath10 which characterizes the energy transfer in the process . here",
    "$ ] denotes the asymmetry between the momenta of the produced electron and positron ( see ref . for the precise definition ) .",
    "if @xmath12 is larger than @xmath13 for some @xmath14 , vacuum photon decay becomes kinematically allowed .",
    "uhe photons decay very quickly into electron - positron pairs and do not reach the earth .",
    "below we restrict to the values of @xmath15 outside this range .",
    "let us consider the bethe - heitler process .",
    "the standard result for the cross section reads@xcite @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electron mass , @xmath18 is the fine structure constant and @xmath19 is the nucleus charge .",
    "lorentz violation significantly suppresses the cross section for negative @xmath20 .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath21 the modified cross section takes the form.]@xcite @xmath22 this expression is suppressed roughly by a factor @xmath23 with respect to the li result .",
    "a future uhe photon detection by cosmic ray experiments would imply that the cross section of the first interaction is not too much suppressed compared to the standard expectation : otherwise the photon would go through the atmosphere without developing a shower .",
    "conservatively , we will assume that the cross section does not differ by more that an order of magnitude .",
    "this gives the bound @xmath24 for negative @xmath15 .",
    "similar ( actually , even stronger ) bound for positive @xmath25 follows from the absence of the vacuum photon decay . barring accidental cancellations we find that a prospective detection of photons with energies @xmath26 will allow to constrain the lv parameters at the level @xmath27 it is worth stressing that these bounds will be insensitive to any astrophysical assumptions as to the origin and propagation of cosmic rays through the interstellar medium .",
    "next we turn to the photon decay in geomagnetic field .",
    "we use@xcite the method of worldline instantons , proposed by affleck , alvarez and manton@xcite to study the schwinger effect .",
    "the photon decay in a weak magnetic field is represented as a tunneling process whose width is given by a statistical sum of a certain auxiliary quantum - mechanical system .",
    "this statistical sum can be evaluated in the saddle - point approximation and yields the following exponential behavior for the photon decay width , @xmath28.\\ ] ] here @xmath29 denotes the magnetic field , @xmath30 is an angle between the photon momentum and the magnetic field . in the lorentz invariant case , @xmath31 , this answer coincides with the standard one @xcite .",
    "we see that the process is exponentially suppressed till the photon energy reaches @xmath32 , which for the earth magnetic field and @xmath33 gives @xmath34 . in the presence of lv with",
    "@xmath35 the exponent is enhanced and the effective threshold energy is shifted upwards . requiring that the shift is not too large again implies @xmath36 . we conclude that a detection of uhe photons at @xmath34 with the preshower signature will yield the constraints , again follows from the absence of vacuum photon decay . ] @xmath37",
    "we have shown that a future uhe photon detection can establish very strong two - sided bounds on the parameters describing deviations from li in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "these bounds will be insensitive to any astrophysical assumptions about the origin of the uhe photons and their propagation towards the earth .",
