    "spectral analysis of large random matrices plays an important role in multivariate statistical estimation and testing problems .",
    "for example , variances of the principal components are functions of covariance eigenvalues @xcite , and roy s largest root test statistic is the spectral distance between the sample covariance and its population counterpart @xcite .",
    "asymptotic behaviors of sample covariance eigenvalues have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "when the dimension @xmath1 is small and the population eigenvalues are distinct , @xcite and @xcite proved the asymptotic normality for sample eigenvalues . under the gaussian assumption ,",
    "@xcite established the edgeworth expansion and showed that the convergence rate is of order @xmath2 . @xcite and @xcite illustrated the effects of skewness and kurtosis on the limiting distribution .",
    "when @xmath1 is large , @xcite revealed for gaussian data that the largest sample eigenvalue , after proper standardization , follows the tracy - widom law asymptotically @xcite .",
    "@xcite further proved that the convergence rate to the tracy - widom law is of order @xmath3 , which is astonishingly fast . despite these elegant properties ,",
    "existing results rely heavily on some simple gaussian or sub - gaussian assumptions @xcite .",
    "their applications to hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals under more general settings are largely unknown .    motivated by the covariance testing problem",
    ", the major focus of this paper is to study asymptotic behaviors of a particular type of spectral statistics related to the covariance matrix .",
    "here we are interested in the non - gaussian setting with the dimension @xmath1 allowed to grow with the sample size @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , let @xmath5 be @xmath4 independent realizations of a @xmath1-dimensional random vector @xmath6 with mean @xmath7 and covariance matrix @xmath8 .",

    "we shall derive the limiting distribution and establish bootstrap confidence intervals for the following spectral statistic @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a prespecified integer - valued parameter representing the  degree of sparsity \" .",

    "we defer to section [ sec : main ] for more details . ] .    to study the limiting behavior of @xmath12 in high dimensions , a major insight is to build the connection between the analysis of the maximum eigenvalue and recent developments in extreme value theory .",
    "in particular , by viewing the maximum eigenvalue as the extreme value of a specific infinite - state stochastic process , the gaussian comparison inequality recently developed in @xcite can be used .",
    "new empirical process bounds are established to ensure the validity of the inference procedure . in the end , bootstrap inference follows .",
    "two interesting observations are discovered .",
