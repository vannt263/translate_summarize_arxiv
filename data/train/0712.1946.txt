    "the universe is locally inhomogeneous .",
    "this inhomogeneity can be expressed by the smoothness parameter @xmath1 proposed by dyer and roeder in 1972 as a constant with values between 0 ( all the matter clumped in structures ) and 1 ( strictly frw case ) , which describes the uniformly distributed matter proportion . in strong gravitational lensing sgl",
    "this fact can be introduced via the eikonal approximation @xcite finding that sgl probability depends on @xmath1 @xcite @xcite . however , due to the structure formation process , @xmath1 must vary on time and sgl must be affected . here",
    "we show how is the variation of the sgl probability by dark matter halos dmh of galaxy clusters when different cdm scenarios of evolution of structure , represented by different forms of @xmath2 , are considered .",
    "we assume spherically symmetric lenses to emphasize in the effect of the structure evolution , although recently has been shown that the ellipticity of the dmh affects strongly the sgl @xcite .",
    "the considered cosmologies are eds ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) , ocdm ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) and lcdm(@xmath5,@xmath7 ) with @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in sec .",
    "2 the smoothness parameter and its introduction in the gl are described . in sec .",
    "3 the lens model and distribution mass function are described . in sec .",
    "4 the gl probability in the three cosmological models is calculated and in sec .",
    "5 the main conclusions are presented .",
    "the smoothness parameter @xmath1 used to describe the local matter distribution have to be inhomogeneous and anisotropic , but if an average value over concentric spheres centered in the observer is considered , it can be express only as a function of cosmological redshift .",
    "this evolution of @xmath1 is related with the evolution of structure in the universe , so that , @xmath10 for @xmath11 to recover the homogeneity of the first stages of the structure formation processes , and while @xmath12 , @xmath1 approaches to the present value , which is unknown .",
    "these requirements are full filled for the santos & lima smoothness parameter @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are dimensionless and can be used to obtain different scenarios of the evolution of structure . in eikonal approximation",
    "this parameter is related with the convergence of light bundles that are propagated in a region far from structures , this effect is know as focusing and it causes the change of the angular diameter distances adds .",
    "this means that the variation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 gives different adds according to the dyer- roeder equation . in sgl distances between source - lens - observer",
    "are adds so , by this way , the effect of evolution of structure is introduce in the study of the probability to observe multiple imaged systems",
    "the probability of sgl with multiple images depends on source and lens positions , distribution , the models used to describe them and the cosmological parameters .",
    "the distribution function describes the comovil numeric density @xmath16 of lenses , which in this case are dmh of galaxy clusters virialized at @xmath17 with mass in @xmath18 .",

    "the density profile of dmh of galaxy clusters is suitable described by nfw singular profile @xcite , which is independent on the primordial density fluctuations spectrum and on the cosmological parameters . inside the scalar radius @xmath28 ,",
    "the dmh density near the center goes as @xmath29 and far form it as @xmath30 .",
    "because of its singularity , this profile is used only to describe external regions .",

    "the order of magnitude of @xmath35 is @xmath36 to 10 , depending strongly on the critical sobredensity of the halo @xmath37 .",
    "the influence of cosmology and the structure formation scenario can be noticed by the presence of adds .",
    "the relative maximum of ( 3.2 ) is the radius of caustic circumference @xmath38 , which limits the area of the sky where a source must be placed in order to produce three images ; this region is known as cross - section @xmath39 .",
    "the cross - section depends on @xmath1 through c. as first approximation , it was considered @xmath40 .",

    "the probability to observe a sgl with production of multiple images by a dmh of a galaxy cluster depends strongly on the cosmological model considered and the parameters used to describe the lens e.g. @xmath51 . in other hand , for sources at @xmath52 the difference in the probability increases , which is higher when the considered current value of smoothness parameter @xmath53 is higher and when scenarios with later formation of systems are assumed ( high values of @xmath15 ) .",
