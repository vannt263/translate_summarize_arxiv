    "in the last few years various technical approaches have been exploited in direct searches for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) @xcite . in particular , the dama / nai collaboration has collected a very large body of statistics which allows one to look for the distinctive signature in dark matter ( dm ) direct detection represented by the annual modulation of the rate @xcite , an effect which is due to the rotation of the earth around the sun @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the dama / nai data after 4 years of running @xcite , corresponding to a total exposure of 57986 kg day , has indeed led to the observation of an annual  modulation effect , which does not appear to be related to any possible source of systematics @xcite .",
    "this exciting result has been analyzed under different hypotheses on the properties of wimp dark matter : purely spin independent coupling @xcite , mixed spin  coherent interaction @xcite , inelastic dark matter @xcite . in the case of purely spin  independent interactions , the annual modulation result has been shown to be compatible with a galactic halo composed , at least partially , by relic neutralinos in different classes of supersymmetric models @xcite .    in the present analysis we consider the case of a wimp with coherent interactions dominant over the spin  dependent ones .",
    "the analysis of the counting rate of any direct detection experiment may be done in terms of the wimp mass @xmath1 and of the quantity @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wimp  nucleon cross section for scalar interaction and @xmath4 . ]",
    "is the fractional amount of local non  baryonic dm density which is ascribed to the wimp responsible for the effect ( @xmath5 ) @xcite . performing a maximum  likelihood analysis of the data , the dama / nai collaboration has derived a region in the plane @xmath1@xmath6 which is compatible at 3@xmath0 c.l . to the observed effect of annual modulation .",
    "the properties of this region are sensitive to astrophysical inputs @xcite , some of which deserve a reanalysis and a deeper insight .",
    "one of the main ingredients for the calculation of the expected rates is the distribution function of wimps in their six  dimensional phase space : @xmath7 ( where the position vector @xmath8 and the velocity vector @xmath9 are defined in the rest frame of the galaxy ) .",
    "direct detection rates @xmath10 depend on the distribution function ( df ) at the earth position in the galaxy : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the location of the earth at a distance @xmath13 kpc from the galactic center and along the galactic plane .",
    "it is therefore clear that an accurate calculation of the expected detection rates requires a knowledge of the phase  space distribution function @xmath7 .    from the observational side ,",
    "the most relevant piece of information coming from astrophysics is related to the rotational velocity of objects bounded to the galaxy : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the newton s constant and @xmath16 denotes the total mass contained inside the radius @xmath17 : @xmath18 the rotational velocity therefore depends on the total matter density distribution in space : @xmath19 where the dm density distribution function is : @xmath20 and @xmath21 represents the contribution to the matter density due to components other than the dm , like the disk and the bulge .",
    "the local values for the rotational velocity and for the dm matter density are denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 and they represent two key parameters in the calculation of wimp direct detection rates , as it will be discussed in the following .    in order to calculate the df of eq .",
    "( [ eq : df ] ) one must invert eq . (",
    "[ eq : rho_dm ] ) taking into account observational data .",
    "this problem is affected by degeneracies that can not be solved without adding some piece of information .",
    "this explains why the velocity distribution represents one of the main source of uncertainty in the calculation of direct detection signals .",
    "the usual approach to this problem consists in assuming that the system has some symmetry and that the distribution @xmath24 depends on the phase space parameters only through some integrals of motion ( energy , angular momentum ) : this last condition automatically implies stationarity and that the jeans equations are verified @xcite .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid may than be calculated as a function of the derivatives of the potential ( which are related to the rotational velocity ) by making use of euler s equation @xcite .",
    "physically , this corresponds to impose hydrostatic equilibrium between pressure and gravitational attraction .",
    "the most common and widely used example of such a procedure , and by far the simplest , is the isothermal sphere model .",
    "it consists in a spherical infinite system with a flat rotational curve , which automatically implies @xmath25 and the potential @xmath26 .",
    "the df may be easily worked out , and turns out to be a maxwellian : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the root mean squared velocity of the wimps .",
    "the isothermal sphere describes a self  gravitating gas of collisionless particles in thermal equilibrium , representing the highest entropy rearrangement of wimps in their phase space .",
    "a strong argument in favour of this last property is the `` violent relaxation '' model of lynden ",
    "bell @xcite , which indicates that the violently changing gravitational field of the newly formed galaxy may have lead the non  interacting wimps to thermal equilibrium .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium and the assumption that the velocity ellipsoid is isotropic allows to calculate @xmath29 through the relation : @xmath30 . due to its simplicity",
    ", the isothermal sphere model has become the `` standard '' assumption in the evaluation of dm expected rates , and has been used extensively in the literature , including the analysis of the dama / nai modulation data @xcite .",
    "however many of its underlying assumptions ( sphericity of the halo , absence of rotation , isotropy of the dispersion tensor , flatness of the rotational curve ) are not strongly constrained by astrophysical observations .",
    "moreover the isothermal sphere is strictly unphysical and can only represent the behaviour of the inner part of physical systems , since it has a total infinite mass and needs some cut  off at large radii .    in light of the latest experimental data on wimp direct searches ,",
    "the issue of possible departures from the isothermal sphere model has gained interest and prompted several discussions @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we intend to analyze this issue in a systematic way , by employing a comprehensive set of self  consistent galactic halo models .",
    "each model introduces a different degree of deviation from the simple isothermal sphere .",
    "we consider modifications in the velocity distribution function which are originated from a change of the gravitational potential or a change of the dm density profile @xcite .",
    "we classify the different models depending on the symmetry properties of the galactic halo : spherical potential / density profile with an isotropic velocity dispersion ; spherical potential / density profile with a non  isotropic velocity dispersion ; axisymmetric models ; triaxial models . for the axisymmetric models we also consider the possibility of having a co  rotating or counter  rotating halo .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the formalism for the calculation of direct detection rates and the annual modulation signal , and summarize the procedure used by the dama / nai collaboration to determine the annual modulation region in the plane @xmath1@xmath6 for a purely spin  independent interacting wimp . in section iii",
    "we describe the halo models that we intend to discuss and introduce a naming scheme that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "section iv is devoted to the discussion of the constraints on the dark halo of our galaxy coming from available observational data . in section",
    "v the annual modulation region is calculated in a systematic way for all the models previously introduced , and the results are discussed .",
    "finally , section vi is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "the expected differential event rate of a wimp direct search experiment is given , for a monoatomic detector , by the expression :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the number of the target nuclei per unit of mass , @xmath33 is the wimp mass , @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the wimp velocity and df in the earth frame ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 is the wimp  nucleus differential cross section and @xmath38 is the nuclear recoil energy .",
    "notice that the detection rate is directly proportional to the local dm density @xmath39 .",
    "the generalization of eq.([eq : diffrate0 ] ) to a diatomic detector , like nai , is straightforward .",
    "the differential cross section is , in general , a sum of a coherent and a spin  dependent contributions . in this paper",
    "we consider only the case of a wimp whose interactions are dominated by the coherent part . in this case",
    "the rate may be expressed in terms of the wimp  nucleon scalar cross section , @xmath40 , as : @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the proton and nucleus mass , @xmath44 is the nuclear mass number , @xmath45 is the maximal recoil energy and @xmath46 is the nuclear form factor for coherent interactions which may be parametrized with the usual helm expression @xcite .",
    "the relation between the velocities @xmath47 and @xmath48 is given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the velocities of the earth and the sun in the galactic rest frame ( @xmath5212 km / sec ) , and @xmath53 is the earth s orbital velocity around the sun ( @xmath5430 km / sec ) .",
    "projecting eq.([eq : vorb ] ) in the galactic plane , one gets : @xmath55 \\label{eq : projection}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the inclination of the plane of rotation with respect to the galactic one , @xmath57 with @xmath58=1 year , and @xmath59 june corresponds to the day when the earth s velocity is at its maximum .    the change of reference frame of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : change],[eq : vorb],[eq : projection ] ) introduces through the df @xmath35 a time dependence in the expected rate @xmath10 . in order to exploit this time",
    " dependence to extract the modulated signal from the measured counting rates , we follow the maximal  likelihood procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer for a detailed discussion .",
    "this procedure allows to determine the region in the plane ( @xmath33  @xmath60 ) which is compatible with the modulation signal . a lower bound on @xmath33 at the value @xmath61 gev is applied , to conform to the analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "the data we analyze in the present paper refer to the full set of data released so far by the dama / nai collaboration @xcite ( dama / nai 04 ) , including also the upper limit on @xmath62 obtained by the same collaboration , as discussed in ref .",
    "the same values of the quenching factors and of the cut efficiences as in refs .",
    "@xcite are used .",
    "we stress that also the determination of upper limits is affected by the choice of the wimps df .",
    "this means that also when confronting upper limits one has to specify the galactic halo models which has been considered in the calculation .",
    "the formalism introduced in the present paper may in fact be used also to quantify the uncertainty in the determination of upper limits from direct detection experiments .",
    "let us turn now to the discussion of the galactic halo models and of the techniques used to calculate the velocity distribution function @xmath63 .",
    "the different models are classified according to the symmetry properties of their matter density profile ( or gravitational potential ) and of the velocity distribution function . we define four classes :    * spherically symmetric matter density with isotropic velocity dispersion ; * spherically symmetric matter density with non  isotropic velocity dispersion ; * axisymmetric models ; * triaxial models .",
    "all the models which we describe in this section , and that will be used in the rest of the paper , are summarized in table [ tab : models ] , where we also introduce a naming scheme that will be of practical use in the discussion .      the first class of models is represented by those with a spherically symmetric matter density @xmath64 and isotropic velocity distribution @xmath65 .",
    "these two conditions imply that the phase ",
    "space df depends on the space and velocity variables only through the energy , which is an integral of motion : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the relative energy ( per unit mass ) of the wimp and @xmath68 is the relative potential , related to the total density @xmath69 through the poisson s equation @xcite : @xmath70 notice that @xmath69 refers to all the matter components of the galaxy , like the disk , the bulge or the halo , as written in eq.([eq : rho_total ] ) .",
    "once the total potential @xmath71 is known , the wimp df @xmath72 may be worked out by inverting eq.([eq : rho_dm ] ) .",
    "a change of variables from @xmath73 to @xmath68 allows to cast eq.([eq : rho_dm ] ) as @xcite : @xmath74 by performing a laplace inversion on eq.([eq : density_psi ] ) , one obtains the eddington formula @xcite : @xmath75 in eqs.([eq : density_psi],[eq : eddington ] ) the normalization of @xmath68 , which is defined through poisson s equation up to an arbitrary constant , is fixed by requiring that @xmath76 .",
    "the velocity distribution function @xmath77 which enters the calculation of direct detection rates is then obtained as in eq.([eq : df ] ) .",
    "eq.([eq : eddington ] ) shows that the dark matter df @xmath78 depends not only on the halo dm density distribution @xmath79 , but also on the density distribution of all the other galactic components .",
    "this has to be the case , since the dm particles move inside the gravitational potential generated by all the matter that makes up the galaxy .",
    "a complete and rigorous determination of the dm df will therefore require to model not only the galactic halo , but also all the other ( disk , bulge ) components of the galaxy ( see , for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , wimp direct detection is directly sensitive only to local properties of the galaxy , and in particular the relevant parameters in the calculation of the detection rate are the local rotational velocity @xmath80 and the local dm matter density @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , @xmath80 is directly related to the average wimp kinetic energy , which is relevant in the scattering process with the nuclei of the detector , and the change of reference frame of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : change],[eq : vorb ] ) , which is crucial in determining the amount of annual modulation in the detection rate . instead , @xmath39 is a sort of normalization factor for the direct detection rate @xmath10 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath10 essentially on local parameters implies that a detailed modeling of the inner ( @xmath81 ) part of the galaxy , where the disk and bulge components are more relevant and in general dominant over the halo , is not crucial for our analysis .",
    "moreover , the matter density of non  halo components at the local position in the galaxy ( @xmath82 ) are no longer dominant with respect to the halo matter density at the same position ( see , for instance ref .",
    "the bulge , in fact , can be described by using a spheroidal density distribution which gives a sizeable contribution inside the first kpc from the galactic center , and it is truncated at about @xmath83 2 kpc .",
    "the disk has an exponential distribution which in most of the models dies away at about 4 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "we will therefore assume in the following that in the outer galaxy the dominant contribution to the matter density is given by the halo : @xmath84 the only basic information which is required from the non  halo components is their contribution to the local rotational velocity @xmath80 : @xmath85   \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath86 a maximal halo occurs when @xmath87 : in this case almost all the local rotational velocity is supported by the halo and the local dm density @xmath39 gets its maximal value @xmath88 compatible with the given @xmath80 .",
    "the opposite situation occurs when @xmath89 assumes its maximal value compatible with observations : in this case , the local rotational velocity gets the maximal contribution from the non  halo components and only a fraction of @xmath80 is supported by the halo . at the same time @xmath39 gets its minimal value @xmath90 , for the same @xmath80 .",
    "the constraints on these parameters are discussed in section [ sec : constraining ] .    from the point of view of calculating the dm df ( eq.([eq : eddington ] ) ) , the occurrence of a maximal or non  maximal halo modifies the gravitational potential @xmath71 and therefore the velocity distribution function @xmath77 is affected . indicating with @xmath91 the potential for the maximal halo , the condition of eq.([eq : condition ] ) allows the generalization to the non  maximal case as : @xmath92 the condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) allows to work out the total potential for the case of non - maximal halos without explicitly modeling the visible parts of the galaxy ( bulk , disk ) : all the dependence of these components are contained in @xmath89 .    as a comment",
    ", we notice that the presence of a non negligible contribution to @xmath80 from the non  halo components alters also the velocity distribution function of the isothermal sphere .",
    "the standard maxwellian form for the isothermal sphere is in fact correct only for a maximal halo .",
    "now that we have discussed the procedure to calculate the velocity distribution function once the matter density of the dm is given , we proceed to introduce the different models .",
    "the first type of model is a direct generalization of the isothermal sphere by introducing a core radius @xmath93 ( model a1 ) .",
    "the density profile is : @xmath94 which corresponds to the following potential for a maximal halo : @xmath95 from the analytic form of this potential we will refer to this type of models as _ logarithmic models_. the usual isothermal sphere ( model a0 ) corresponds to the limit @xmath96 : @xmath97 which corresponds to the following potential for a maximal halo : @xmath98 for a maximal halo , the velocity distribution function arising from eqs .",

    "the other constraints are used in order to determine the allowed ranges for @xmath39 , for each halo model .",
    "the allowed interval for @xmath80 is : @xmath173 which conservatively relies on purely dynamical observations @xcite .",
    "proper motion measurements of nearby stars @xcite lead to similar estimates for the central value of @xmath80 , with a significantly smaller uncertainty .",
    "however they are based on the assumption of circular orbit of the observed objects . for definiteness , we will use in the following three representative values for @xmath80 , which correspond to its central value and to the boundaries of its allowed 90% c.l .",
    "range of eq.([eq : v0 ] ) : @xmath174 km sec@xmath175 .",
    "for the three representative values of @xmath80 we then determine the corresponding allowed ranges for @xmath39 .",
    "for each halo model and for each value of @xmath80 , we calculate , as a function of @xmath39 , two quantities : _ ( i ) _ the total amount of mass @xmath89 in components other than the halo ( _ e.g. _ : disk , bulge ) which is necessary in order to match the given value of local rotational velocity @xmath80 ; _ ( ii ) _ the value of the rotational curve at a distance of 100 kpc from the center of the galaxy : @xmath176 ( @xmath177 kpc ) .",
    "these two quantities are somewhat constrained from observations , even though their constraints are often obtained by using some degree of galactic modeling .",
    "we conservatively quote the following ranges @xcite : @xmath178 where @xmath179 denotes the solar mass .",
    "the first constraint limits the amount of non - halo components , while the second is a constraints of `` essentially flatness '' rotational curve : only galactic halo models which provide a rotational curve which does not deviate from a flat one more than 20% at 100 kpc are accepted .",
    "the constraint of eq.([eq : lim_vrot ] ) is compatible with the estimates of the galactic mass at large radii as obtained by the dynamics of satellites of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath89 and @xmath180 as a function of @xmath39 is shown if fig .",
    "1 ( which refers to @xmath181 km s@xmath175 ) , fig .",
    "2 ( @xmath182 km s@xmath175 ) and fig .",
    "3 ( @xmath183 km s@xmath175 ) . each line refers to a different halo model .",
    "the upper panels show that @xmath89 is a decreasing function of @xmath39 , since increasing the amount of dark matter in the galaxy implies that less matter in other galactic components is required to support the rotational curve . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of the rotational velocity in the outer galaxy is totally supported by the dark halo , and it is larger for more massive haloes .    when the constraints expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lim_mvis ] ) and ( [ eq : lim_vrot ] ) are simultaneously applied , an allowed interval for @xmath39 may be derived for each halo model .    the procedure outlined above",
    "may be used as a simple recipe for identifying the intervals for the local density parameter .",
    "however , some caution must be taken in the application of the bounds on @xmath89 in eq.([eq : lim_mvis ] ) .",
    "as already discussed in the previous section , for the models of class a and class b we solve the eddington equation in order to determine the velocity distribution function of dark matter particles . in this case",
    "we can take into account also the situation in which the local rotational velocity is only partially supported by the halo , and therefore we can apply the limits to @xmath89 given by eq.([eq : lim_mvis ] ) .",
    "instead , the analytic models of class c and class d may be applied only to the extreme case of a fully maximal ",
    "halo , since the analytic formulae for @xmath63 are derived under the assumption that only the halo matter density is present . for these models ( class c and class d )",
    "the only case we can deal with is that of a fully maximal halo , which corresponds to @xmath184 .",
    "this represents a conservative upper limit for @xmath39 . from fig .",
    "13 we can see that upper bounds to @xmath39 obtained from the @xmath184 limit are only a few percent larger than what is obtained by imposing the lower limit of eq.([eq : lim_mvis ] ) : @xmath185 . for consistency and simplicity ,",
    "we will use @xmath186 as a lower limit also for models of class a and b.    the allowed intervals for @xmath39 that we obtain by imposing the bounds on @xmath89 and @xmath180 are listed in table [ tab : intervals ] . as discussed above , both values @xmath90 and @xmath88 will be used in the next sections to perform the modulation analysis of the dama / nai experimental data , while only @xmath88 will be used for the analysis of the data for models of class c and d. we stress that the reason for this stands in the fact that for the analytic models of classes c and d , we know @xmath187 only for a maximal  halo .",
    "in this section we make use of the halo models described in section iii , with the choice of parameters shown in table [ tab : models ] , to analyze the annual  modulation signal present in the dama / nai data @xcite in terms of relic wimps with purely coherent interactions .",
    "the procedure is the one outlined in section ii .",
    "the results are presented as 3@xmath0 annual ",
    "modulation regions shown in the plane @xmath188 versus @xmath1 .",
    "all figures are divided in three panels which correspond to the cases : @xmath189 , 220 , 270 km sec@xmath175 .",
    "a general feature of all the models is that by raising the parameter @xmath80 the modulation region moves from the upper  right to the lower  left of the @xmath33@xmath6 plane .",
    "this is easily understood since , for a given dm density profile , higher values of @xmath80 imply higher values of @xmath39 ( through eq .",
    "( [ eq : vrot ] ) ) and of the velocity ellipsoid @xmath190 ( through the jeans equations ) ; the experimental value of the signal and the measured wimp  nucleus recoil energy are fixed by the data , therefore the modulation region moves downward because : @xmath191 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffrate0 ] ) ) and moves to lower masses because : @xmath192 on the other hand , when one compares the different density profiles that we have discussed in the previous sections , it is worth noticing that , for a given value of @xmath80 , a stronger singularity in the galactic center lowers the value of @xmath88 ( in order to keep constant the mass integral ) with the consequence that the lower part of the modulation region rises .",
    "so the smallest values of @xmath6 are reached by the models with a less singular density profile .",
    "figures 418 show the result of the analysis for the models with a spherically symmetric density profile ( models a07 , b17 ) .",
    "models a07 have an isotropic velocity dispersion , while in models b17 a degree of anisotropy in the velocity dispersion is introduced through the osipkov ",
    "merrit term of eq.([eq : om ] ) .",
    "the amount of anisotropy is controlled by the @xmath120 parameter of eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta0 ] ) and it has been fixed at the value : @xmath193 .",
    "this value corresponds to a radial anisotropy . in order to account for the uncertainty in the dm local density @xmath39 , for each case",
    "two regions are given , the higher ( lower ) corresponding to @xmath194 ( @xmath88 ) , where @xmath90 and @xmath88 have been obtained as discussed in section iv and are reported in table [ tab : intervals ] .",

    "this is confirmed by the fact that in most cases the modulation regions move upwards and widens , although the size of the effect can be small .",
    "the effect of radial anisotropy on the wimp mass is more involved .",
    "in particular , the modulation regions for models b1 , b3 , b5 , b6 extend to heavier wimp masses compared to the corresponding isotropic cases , while for models b2 , b4 , b7 the region moves to smaller wimp masses .    as already pointed out , for the models belonging to classes c and d",

    "the flatness parameter @xmath135 has been chosen in order to have the maximal flatness compatible with observations and with the positivity of the df .",

    "[ fig : c1_corot ] develops a second minimum at high wimp masses , and this is not observed in the corresponding non  rotating or counter  rotating cases . we have numerically verified that the peculiar disconnected region at high wimp masses reduces in size when the flatness parameter is increased ( since in this way the velocity distribution function becomes more similar to the non  flattened one ) , while it shifts towards lower masses when the core radius @xmath93 is decreased .",
    "we conclude the discussion of our results with the triaxial models shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : d1 ] , [ fig : d2 ] , [ fig : d3 ] , [ fig : d4 ] where , to be definite , the same choice of parameters of ref.@xcite is adopted .",

    "since in the two cases the sun s position @xmath207 is the same , @xmath39 is higher for models d1 , d2 than for models d3 , d4 ( see table [ tab : intervals ] ) . as a consequence , the modulation regions of fig .",
    "[ fig : d1 ] , [ fig : d2 ] reach smaller values of @xmath188 compared to those of figs .",

    "( [ eq : delta ] ) ) .",
    "solving the jeans equation for the potential of eq.([eq : potential_triaxial ] ) in the spherical limit @xmath210 ( which corresponds to a non - cored isothermal sphere ) leads to the relation @xcite : @xmath211 note that this property is a consequence of the flatness of the rotational curve , and would not be true , for instance , including a core radius in the potential .",
    "eq.([eq : jeans ] ) implies that , in this model , the tangential components of the velocity ellipsoid are fixed by @xmath80 . as a consequence of this ,",
