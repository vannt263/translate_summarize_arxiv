    "the corresponding measures on non - markovianity are given and discussed in refs .",
    "the non - markovianity measure @xmath82 is available to capture the non - markovian behavior of the unital aspect of the dynamics .",
    "but for the non - unital aspect , it is not capable . to show this",

    "one can see that the trace distance between any two evolved states is irrelevant to the non - unital part @xmath87 of the time evolution . then if there are two quantum channels , whose affine maps are @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , the characteristic of trace distance between the evolving states from any two initial states can not distinguish these two channels .",
    "more importantly , @xmath87 may cause the non - divisibility of the quantum process @xmath90 , and this can not be revealed by @xmath82 .    on the other hand , the non - unital part @xmath87 has its own physical meaning : @xmath91 is necessary for the increasing of the purity @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "in other words , @xmath93 besides the non - markovian feature , the non - unitality is another kind of general feature of quantum processes . in analogy to the definition of blp non - markovianity , we defined the following measure on the degree of the non - unitality of a quantum process : @xmath94 } { \\mathrm{d}t } \\right| \\mathrm{d}t,\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the initial state . obviously , @xmath96 vanishes if @xmath97 .",
    "since the non - unital aspect of the dynamics , which is not revealed by the trace distance , has its own speciality , we aim to measure the effect of non - unitality on non - markovian behavior .",
    "however , a perfect separation of the non - unital aspect from the total non - markovianity may be infeasible .",
    "therefore we require a weak version @xmath98 for measuring non - unital non - markovianity to satisfy the following three conditions : ( i ) @xmath99 vanishes if @xmath90 is infinitesimal divisible , ( ii ) @xmath99 vanishes if @xmath90 is unital , ( iii ) @xmath100 should be relevant to @xmath87 .",

    "the first condition is guaranteed if we require that @xmath66 is monotone under any cpt maps , i.e. , @xmath105\\leq d(\\rho_{1},\\rho_{2})$ ] for any quantum channel @xmath42 . for the unital time evolution ,",
    "the set @xmath106 only contains the maximally mixed state , so the above defined @xmath100 vanishes , and the second condition is satisfied .",
    "the third condition excludes the trace distance .    in this paper",

    "bures distance is an appropriate distance for @xmath100 because it obeys the monotonicity under cpt maps  @xcite and is relevant to @xmath87 . as here",
    "only the monotonicity of distance is relevant , for simplicity , we can also take the square of the bures distance or just the opposite value of unlmann fidelity as a simple version of monotone `` distance ''  @xcite .",
    "quantum relative entropy  @xcite @xmath110 $ ] , or its symmetric version @xmath111 , is another qualified candidate for the distance . noting that when the support of @xmath83 is not within the support of @xmath84 , namely , @xmath112 , @xmath113 will be infinite , so in such cases , quantum relative entropy will bring singularity to the measure of non - markovianity .",
    "also , hellinger distance  @xcite is qualified .",
    "although all of these distances are monotone under cpt maps , they may have different characteristics in the same dynamics , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the difference between non - unital non - markovian measure defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : definition_nun ] ) and the blp - type measures , including those which use other alternative distances , is the restriction on the pairs of initial states . comparing with the blp - type measures relying on any pair of initial states , the non - unital non - markovianity measure only relies on the pairs consisting of the maximally mixed state and its trajectory states . on one hand",
    ", this restriction makes the non - unital non - markovianity measure vanish when the quantum processes are unital , no matter they are markovian or non - markovian ; on the other hand , this restriction reflects that non - unital non - markovianity measure reveals only a part of information concerning the non - markovian behaviors .",
    "to illustrate the non - unital non - markovian behavior , we give an example in this section .",
    "we use the generalized amplitude damping channel ( gadc ) as a prototype to construct a quantum process .",

    "first , let us consider the @xmath82 for this quantum process .",
