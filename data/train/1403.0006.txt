    "on young stars , we observe flares hundreds to ten thousand times more energetic and frequent than solar flares . along with energy scales",
    "greater by orders of magnitude , we also observe physical scales far greater than in the solar case : while solar prominences soar around 1 r@xmath0 above the solar surface and cmes launch from similar radii in the sun s atmosphere , magnetic structures on t tauri stars ( tts , young solar analogs)post - flare loops and prominences  can extend tens of stellar radii from the star s surface .",
    "the discovery of such large magnetic structures arose from solar - stellar analogy , applying solar flare models to the x - ray light curve data from young stars ( * ? ? ? * ( e.g. , reale et al .",
    "1998 ) ) .    in characterizing the solar - stellar connection ,",
    "overwhelming evidence has been found in support of the idea that the fundamental physics of magnetic reconnection is the same , despite differences in stellar parameters ( e.g. , mass , radius , @xmath1 , age ) . as such , we approach analysis of young stars flares and cmes under this supposition , and aim to assess how the physical properties of these events  and their frequency  may scale accordingly with stellar parameters . ultimately , we seek to understand the consequences of exoplanetary space weather on protostellar systems and their forming planets .",
    "the inference of magnetic loops many stellar radii in extent ( * ? ? ? * ( favata et al . 2005 ; hereafter f05 ) ) inspired three questions : one , are these loops interacting with circumstellar disks ? in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aarnio et al . ( 2010 ) ) , we did not find evidence for this .",
    "second , if there is not a star - disk link , how do the loops remain stable for the multiple rotation periods over which the x - ray flares are observed to decay ?",
    "we showed in ( * ? ? ? * aarnio et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ) that when modeled as hot prominences , the addition of a scaled - up wind consistent with tts observations provided sufficient support for the loops to be stable . finally , here ( * ? ?",
    "* ( and in aarnio , matt , & stassun , 2012 ; hereafter aa12 ) ) we address the third question of what happens when stability is lost : at many stellar radii , is the specific angular momentum shed significant enough to slow stellar rotation ?    in order to estimate the effects of eruptive prominences and stellar cmes on the rotation of young stars , we must procure two ingredients : the mass lost via these events , and their frequency of occurrence . despite ongoing and historical efforts to observe stellar cmes ,",
    "we lack definitive detections and thus frequency distributions .",
    "it is known that at times , magnetic reconnection on the sun will produce both a flare and an associated cme ; for stars , the flare is the observable quantity , and so we characterize stellar cme frequency by using stellar flare frequency as a proxy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show our solar flare energy / cme mass relationship ( * ? ?",
    "* ( aarnio et al . 2011 , hereafter aa11 ) ) extrapolated up to the energies of young stellar flares .",
    "we calculate loop masses for the 32 `` superflaring '' stars from the _ chandra _ orion ultradeep project ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( getman et al . 2005 ) ) from the parameters reported by f05 .",
    "interestingly , these loop masses are close in parameter space to the extrapolated solar relationship .",
    "this is perhaps unsurprising , as the plasma confined in a post - flare loop has properties which relate to the energy of the flare . in aa11",
    ", we found that for associated flares and cmes , that is to say , flares and cmes which likely originated from a shared magnetic reconnection event , the cme mass and flare energy were related .",
    "as such , the post - flare loop mass and mass of an associated cme should then also be related .    from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shibata & yokoyama ( 2002 ) ) , we can estimate the total energy released by a flare is related to the total magnetic energy in a flare loop : @xmath2 if we substitute the loop volume expressed in terms of mass ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) , we find a relationship between the total flare energy and the mass confined in the magnetic loop ( dashed , parallel lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "[ ]    here , to be consistent with the analysis of f05 , we assume an euclidian loop filling but do note that recent solar x - ray flare imaging has indicated that a fractal scaling of v(l)@xmath4l@xmath5 is likely a more accurate characterization ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( e.g. , aschwanden , stern , & gdel , 2008 ) ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the post - flare loop masses even lie near the extrapolated solar cme mass / flare energy relationship , several orders of magnitude away in parameter space . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we have also shown representative ranges of x - ray flare energy and prominence mass for two k dwarfs intermediate in age to the tts sample and the sun ; with an eruptive prominence thought to be the core of a cme , these mass ranges likely represent lower limits on the range of cme masses on these stars . in the following calculations , to represent a fiducial tts case , we will simply extrapolate the solar relationship to generate a stellar cme mass distribution .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the frequency distributions for flares observed on the sun , tts , m dwarfs , and active , main sequence g stars . for this work ,",
    "we use the tts frequency distribution",
    ". clearly , not all cmes are flare - associated , nor are all flares cme - associated ; aa11 found , however , that the association fraction increases with increasing flare energy , so for young stars for which we observe flares several orders of magnitude more energetic than in the solar case , we simply assume this association fraction to be of order unity .    [ ]      in aa12 , we extrapolate the solar cme mass / flare energy relationship ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) to tts flare energies and frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and construct a cme frequency distribution as a function of cme mass .",
    "given the observational completeness limits on the flare distributions that went into the cme distribution , we derive lower and upper limits on the mass loss rate by empirical ( integrating the distribution ) and analytical ( integrating a fit to the distribution ) means .",
    "the range of mass loss rates we estimate for the tts case is 10@xmath6 - 10@xmath7 m@xmath0 yr@xmath8 .    to assess the torque applied against stellar rotation by these cmes , we apply stellar wind models with mass loss rates set as determined above . given the episodic nature of cmes , we included an efficiency parameter to account for the fact that steady - state winds are more efficient at removing angular momentum than `` clumpy '' winds ( cf .",
    "aa12 and references therein ) .",
    "we adopt a dipolar field with strength 600 g , consistent with observations of tts fields , and allow the stellar radius to contract as stellar evolution models predict .    in a protostellar system ,",
    "multiple torques act simultaneously to spin up and spin down the star . in this analysis , we compared spin up due to contraction and spin down due to mass loss from stellar cmes to see if , at any point in the pre - main sequence our fiducial tts could have its rotation slowed due to cmes . comparing parameters of efficiency and the range of mass loss rates we calculated ,",
    "it became clear that only towards the end of the pre - main sequence phase ( ages @xmath96 myr ) could a very efficient , high cme mass loss rate begin to counteract spin up from contraction .",
    "we have left out factors such as spin up from accretion and mass loss via stellar wind ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* matt & pudritz ( 2005 ) ) explore these two torques in depth and the necessary conditions for an accretion powered stellar wind to slow stellar rotation .",
    "we have shown that for young , solar - type stars , spin down due to cmes might play a significant role in stellar rotation evolution after the star has ceased accreting .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] illustrate a critical selection effect in performing this kind of calculation : we only have data for the most active young stars , or the star conveniently located at 1 au .",
    "there is a dearth of data for older , less active stars , and we suggest that filling in the gaps in flare x - ray energy could trace age evolution in these parameter spaces .",
    "the addition of data from the @xmath1020 - 50 myr old k dwarfs in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] hints at this , but more data are needed to conclusively show age dependence . in both figures , we have taken care to specify the masses of the stars involved : how would evolution with stellar age look in these parameter spaces as a function of stellar mass ? while the fundamental physics are the same , the scaling could change , and the ramifications certainly would . for low - mass stars in particular ,",
    "high activity levels are observed for longer fractions of the stars lives ; this could have grave implications for exoplanets as these stars habitable zones could be within range of extreme exo - weather ."
