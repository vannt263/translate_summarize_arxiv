    "therefore , we did not apply the corrections to these passbands .",
    "the strmgren @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands are very similar to the johnson @xmath22 and @xmath26 bands , and because the two color transformations agree well for the metal - poor population in @xmath27 color ( see fig .",

    "synthetic cmds were then constructed for the relevant filter systems , and they were first compared with the observed cmds by eye fitting . at this stage , initial guesses of age and helium abundance were assigned , and distance modulus , reddening , and [ fe / h ] values of each subpopulation were fixed within the observational uncertainty .    the best fitting values of age and helium abundance for all subpopulations were then simultaneously determined by performing a @xmath2 minimization between the observed and synthetic hess diagrams .",

    ", we constructed a set of synthetic cmds with an age resolution of 0.1 gyr and helium abundance resolution of 0.01 , including observational error simulations.based on these models , synthetic hess diagrams were produced by averaging 1000 simulations to minimize stochastic effects .",
    "the synthetic hess diagrams were finally compared with the observed ones using the idlfunction xsq    ' '' ''    test , which performs the @xmath2 goodness - of - fit test between the observed and expected frequencies of a theoretical distribution .",
    "we have fixed helium abundance of the metal - poor first - generation ( g1 ) subpopulation to be normal value ( i.e. , y = y@xmath30 + 2z , y@xmath30 = 0.23 ) , so that g1 was examined only for age variation , while the metal - rich second - generation ( g2 ) subpopulation was investigated for the variations of both age and helium abundance , simultaneously . panels ( c ) and ( e ) in figure 3 are the model hess diagrams with the minimum @xmath2 , and figure 4 is the distribution of reduced @xmath2 ( @xmath31 ) values for the variations in age and helium abundance of each subpopulation .",
    "the 68% ( 1 @xmath32 ) confidence levels were calculated by bootstrapping with 1000 simulations for each subpopulation .",
    "the estimated 1 @xmath32 errors are typically @xmath33 0.3 gyr for the relative age and @xmath33 0.02 for helium abundance ( y ) .",
    "note that these errors are only for the case when the metallicities and the total cno contents are held fixed , and therefore , the actual errors would be larger if the measurement errors of metallicity and [ cno / fe ] are not negligible .",
    "the uncertainties in the distance modulus and reddening , which are fixed in the analysis , as well as those in stellar models , are also not included in the quoted errors .",
    "note , however , that they would have only limited impact on the estimation of relative differences in age and helium abundance .",
    "as numerous photometric and spectroscopic studies have been devoted to it , the most massive gc , @xmath0  cen , is indeed the most complex object among gcs in the milky way .",
    "it shows several prominent features in the cmds such as a double ms , multiple subgiant branches ( sgbs ) , multiple rgbs , and extreme blue hbs ( ebhbs ) , as well as large variations in the spectroscopic abundance of heavy elements @xcite .",
    "the multiple and discrete rgbs , together with their spectroscopic variations in the abundance of heavy elements , directly indicate that subpopulations in @xmath0  cen were influenced by sne . meanwhile , the presence of a double ms and the fact that the bluer ms is more metal - rich than the redder ms strongly suggest that there is a large variation of helium abundance in this cluster @xcite .",
    "the presence of unusually extended hb is also naturally explained by the subpopulations enhanced in helium @xcite .    following the techniques and spirits employed in our previous investigation @xcite , we have constructed new synthetic cmds for @xmath0  cen . as described in  2.1 ,",
    "there have been two major improvements in our modeling .",
    "one is the adoption of the new y@xmath1 hb evolutionary tracks , together with the corresponding y@xmath1 isochrones , with which the enhancements in both helium abundance and [ cno / fe ] can be tested self - consistently .",
    "the other is the improvement of the color - temperature transformation including the  semi - empirical corrections \" for the @xmath15 acs / wfc f435w and f625w passbands ( see fig .",
    "furthermore , the best fitting parameters are now determined with the method described in  2.2 . in the construction of synthetic cmds",
    ", the metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) for the five subpopulations were first adopted from the most recent spectroscopic observations of rgb stars @xcite , which are largely consistent with earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "the differences in [ cno / fe ] among the five subpopulations were taken from the recent observations by @xcite , and the adopted values are listed in table 2 .",
    "we have then determined the best fitting ages and helium abundances by performing the @xmath2 minimization on the hess diagrams employing the @xmath15 acs / wfc f435w and f658n passbands . in figures 5 and 6 ,",
    "our synthetic models are compared with the observed cmds by @xcite , and the best fitting parameters obtained by our model simulations are listed in table 2 .",
    "these model cmds were specifically constructed to reproduce the observed cmds , adopting the same @xmath15 filter systems , population ratios , and photometric errors .",
    "for the two most metal - poor subpopulations , which we refer to as g1 and g2 , reasonable agreements with the observations , from ms to hb , are achieved with normal helium abundances ( i.e. , y = y@xmath30 + 2z , y@xmath30 = 0.23 ) . the rr lyrae stars belonging to these metal - poor subpopulations are also providing a very firm constraint ( @xmath29y @xmath34 0.01 ) on the helium abundance as the luminosities and periods of rr lyraes depend very sensitively on helium abundance ( see below ) . for the ages of these subpopulations ,",
    "our fitting technique is suggesting 13.1 @xmath33 0.2 and 13.0 @xmath33 0.3 gyrs , respectively , and therefore they could be coeval to within the uncertainty .",
    "for the intermediate metallicity subpopulation , g3 , however , a large amount of helium enhancement ( @xmath29y = 0.18 @xmath33 0.02 ) is suggested from our fitting technique to reproduce not only the bluer and fainter ms but also the ebhb stars .",
    "this is readily understood by the effects of helium abundance in stellar astrophysics . because of the higher core temperature and decreased envelope opacity , helium - rich stars , in general , are bluer and brighter for a given mass .",
    "since they evolve faster than helium - poor stars , helium - rich stars would have smaller masses for a given age , and therefore the helium - rich ms appears both bluer and fainter than the helium - poor sequence on the isochrone ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the same reason , helium - rich hb stars have smaller total masses than do less helium - rich stars and end up on the blue hb or ebhb @xcite .",
    "the best fitting age for this helium enhanced g3 is 12.0 @xmath33 0.4 gyr , which is about 1 gyr younger than the reference subpopulations ( g1 and g2 ) .",
    "similarly , for the two most metal - rich subpopulations , g4 and g5 , our models require helium enhancements as much as that for g3 , from the presence of ebhb stars and the round shape of the sgbs . if they were not enhanced in helium abundance , they should have red hb stars or red clumps and more flattened sgbs at their metallicities , [ fe / h ] @xmath35 @xmath41.0 ( see fig . 8 below ,",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". for these subpopulations , our fitting technique is suggesting a common age of 11.4 @xmath33 0.4 gyr , and therefore , the age difference between g1 and g5 is predicted to be about 1.7 @xmath33 0.5 gyr .",

    "in order to illustrate , independently , the effects of metallicity , [ cno / fe ] , age , and helium abundance on the overall morphology in cmd , figure 8 compares the synthetic cmds constructed under different combinations of these parameters .",
    "the presented models are for the metallicities comparable to the most metal - poor and the most metal - rich subpopulations in @xmath0  cen , g1 and g5 .",
    "first , the @xmath29z - only model in panel ( a ) is for the case in which g5 has enhanced metallicity but the same [ cno / fe ] , age , and helium abundance with g1 . the @xmath29z + @xmath29cno + @xmath29 t model in panel ( b )",
    "is for the case in which [ cno / fe ] is also enhanced and age is decreased for g5 .",
    "both enhanced [ cno / fe ] and decreased age are pushing the hb of g5 to even redder color ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while they have opposite effects on the ms turn - off ( msto ) and sgb regions ( see also fig .",
    "7 ) so that no appreciable change is seen there . finally , @xmath29z + @xmath29cno + @xmath29 t + @xmath29y model in panel ( c ) is for the case where the helium abundance of g5 is also significantly enhanced , as in our best simulation .",
    "as is clear from figure 8 , g5 would have the red hb in the models without helium enhancement , while the enhanced helium abundance in panel ( c ) pushes the hb stars into the ebhb region .",
    "it is also shown that the luminosity and color of msto , together with the sgb slope , are fairly affected by this variation in helium abundance .    in our modeling , the effects of enhancements in helium and the total cno abundances were only considered in the stellar interior , and it was assumed that their effects on stellar atmosphere would be negligible .",
    "for the effect of helium abundance , we have confirmed this using the helium - enhanced model fluxes of @xcite.figure 9a shows the model spectra of two stars with different helium abundances ( @xmath38 = 0.10 ) but the same temperature , gravity , and metallicity ( i.e. , @xmath11 = 6000 k , log @xmath19 = 4.5 , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath41.5 ) , which correspond roughly to stars near the mstos of g2 and g3 in @xmath0  cen .",

    " , however , some differences between the two synthetic spectra are noticed .",
    "figure 9c shows that , in the worst situation , combinations of @xmath11 , log @xmath19 , [ fe / h ] , and the helium variations of @xmath38 = 0.10 can make differences in magnitude up to @xmath30.15 in the uv bands . in the case of the total cno abundance",

    "figure 13 explains the effects of variations in the total cno abundance , overall metallicity , and helium abundance , independently .",
    "if we assume only the difference in [ cno / fe ] between the two subpopulations , to reproduce the split on the sgb , as suggested for ngc  1851 @xcite , our models fail to explain the presence of the rgb split in the @xmath18 index and the ebhb stars ( the upper panels ) .",
    "note that , for illustrative purpose , we have increased the difference to 0.5 dex from the observed value ( @xmath30.13 dex ) , because the observed difference is too small to reproduce the sgb split .",
    "similarly , with the assumption of enhancement only in [ fe / h ] , our model for g2 also fails to reproduce the ebhb stars , while the split on the rgb can be explained ( the middle panels ) .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the metallicity effect , as the hb morphology is getting redder with increasing metallicity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while this difference in [ fe / h ] reproduces some split on the sgb , it is not sufficient to explain the observed difference .",
    "the bottom panels of figure 13 show that additional enhancement in helium is needed to overcome the effect of metallicity on the hb and to reproduce the ebhb stars , as already explained in  3.1 . similarly to the case of @xmath0  cen , this enhancement of helium also helps to reproduce the observed split on the sgb ( see fig .",
    "the argument based on the population ratio further supports our hypothesis that the ebhb stars belong to the metal - rich subpopulation g2 .",
    "the number ratio between the bluer and redder rgbs in figure 11c and those in @xcite is about 0.7:0.3 . @xcite and @xcite have also suggested a similar number ratio ( 0.62:0.38 ) between the bright and faint sgbs . within the error ,",
    "this is also consistent with the ratio of the ebhb stars which comprise roughly 25% of all hb stars in panel ( a ) of figures 11 and 12 .",
    "this would then suggest that the bright sgb , bluer rgb , and blue hb stars are all associated with the majority , metal - poor subpopulation ( g1 ) , while the faint sgb and redder rgb stars are progenitors of the ebhb stars , associated with the minority metal - rich subpopulation ( g2 ) .",
    "recent observations of ngc  1851 , which is well - known for its unusual bimodal hb distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicate that it also belongs to the peculiar group of massive gcs influenced by sne enrichment like @xmath0  cen and m22 .",
    "not only a double rgb has been revealed from several photometric observations @xcite , but also some spreads in [ fe / h ] have been reported from spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "ngc  1851 also shows other signatures for the presence of two subpopulations , such as a double sgb @xcite , a cn bimodality @xcite , and variations in light and @xmath37-process element abundances @xcite .",
    "the origin of the observed sgb split , together with its possible links to the rgb split and the bimodal hb distribution , however , is still under debate .",
    "for instance , the sgb spilt can be explained by a difference in age of @xmath311.5 gyr @xcite , by an increase of total cno abundance by a factor of @xmath324 @xcite , or by a combined effect of the differences in overall metallicity ( @xmath29[fe / h ] @xmath47 0.15 dex ) and helium abundance ( @xmath29y @xmath47 0.05 ; @xcite ) .",
    "based on the framework of our previous modeling @xcite , we have constructed new synthetic cmds for ngc  1851 .",
    "the best fitting parameters were determined with the technique described in  2.2 . in the case of ngc  1851 ,",
    "there is still no general consensus on the observed value of @xmath29[cno / fe ] between the two subpopulations @xcite , but @xcite recently concluded that the difference in [ cno / fe ] is less than 0.2 dex . considering this and the similarity of ngc  1851 with",
    "m22 , here , we have adopted 0.1 dex for @xmath29[cno / fe ] .",
    "given the small value , this should have only a little effect in our modeling .    in figure 14 ,",
    "our models are compared with new cmds of ngc  1851 , obtained from _ ca - by _ photometry ( s .- i .",
    "han et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "this observation confirms the previously reported split of the rgb in the @xmath18 index @xcite .",
    "similarly , figure 15 compares our models with the cmds from the acs survey @xcite.the model parameters determined by our fitting technique are listed in table 4 . with the small variations in metallicity ( @xmath29[fe / h ] = 0.13 dex ) and the total cno content ( @xmath29[cno / fe ] = 0.1 dex ) between the two subpopulations , our fitting technique suggests that the difference in helium abundance is considerable ( @xmath29y = 0.06 @xmath33 0.01 ) , while the difference in age is relatively small ( @xmath29 t = 0.5 @xmath33 0.2 gyr ) .",
    "this result is qualitatively similar to the case of m22 .",
    "the faint sgb can be explained mostly by the combined effects of the metallicity and helium enhancements , as both of them make mstos fainter ( fig .",
    "15 ) , while the small variations in the total cno abundance and age have only little impact on the cmd . in particular , as discussed above ( fig .",
    "7 ) , the total cno content and age basically affect mstos in opposite directions . if there were no difference in [ cno / fe ] between g1 and g2 , then the age difference would be even smaller ( @xmath29 t @xmath47 0.0 gyr ) .",
    "the ca - strong redder rgb in the @xmath18 index can be accounted for solely by the effect of metal enhancement , which makes rgbs redder ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "the helium enhancement slightly moves the rgb to the opposite direction , but the effect of metal enrichment is far more important . in the hb region ,",
    "the effect of helium enhancement , which makes hb morphology bluer , easily overcomes the effects of metallicity and cno contents ( see fig . 13 ) , and therefore the presence of blue hb , populated by g2 , can be explained .",
    "note that our model for g2 is also consistent with recent measurement of helium abundances for the blue hb stars ( y = 0.29 @xmath33 0.05 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our models indicate , therefore , that the majority subpopulation , g1 , comprises the metal - poor bright sgb , ca - weak bluer rgb , and red hb stars ; while the minority subpopulation , g2 , is associated with the metal - rich faint sgb , ca - strong redder rgb , and blue hb stars .",
    "this is consistent with the population ratios estimated from figures 14 and 15 .",
    "the number fraction between the bright and faint sgbs is roughly 0.68:0.32 ( fig .",
    "15c ) , and the ratio between the bluer and redder rgbs is about 0.71:0.29 ( fig .",
    "this also agrees with the number ratios reported in previous works @xcite , to within the uncertainty .",
    "the ratio between the red and blue hbs is about 0.69:0.31 ( fig .",
    "14a and fig .",
    "15a ) , if rr lyrae stars belong to metal - poor subpopulation ( g1 ) .",
    "note that the mean period of rr lyrae stars ( @xmath8p@xmath48@xmath49 = 0.531 day ) , which is normal for the metallicity of ngc  1851 @xcite , also indicates that most of the rr lyrae variables come from the majority subpopulation ( g1 ) having normal helium abundance .",
    "we have compared our models with the observations of three peculiar gcs , @xmath0  cen , m22 , and ngc  1851 , to estimate ages , metallicities , and helium abundances of their subpopulations . based on our results , in figure 16",
    ", we schematically illustrate the star formation histories and accompanying enrichments of metallicity and helium abundance in these stellar systems .",
    "we find that the age differences between the metal - rich and metal - poor subpopulations in these gcs are relatively small , @xmath30.31.7 gyr , and metal - rich subpopulations with redder rgbs are also enhanced in helium abundance .",
    "the formation time scale of stellar populations in these gcs is therefore expected to be fairly short , i.e. , @xmath31.7 gyr for @xmath0  cen and less than 1 gyr for m22 and ngc  1851 .    how this could be understood in terms of their formation origin ?",
    "the most natural assumption would be that they are self - enriched , in which later generations of stars formed from the gas enriched by the ejecta of massive stars in earlier generations .",
    "as for the sources of chemical enrichment and pollution in these gcs , at least three viable mechanisms have been proposed thus far .",
    "the explosion of type ii sne is required for the enrichments of heavy elements @xcite and perhaps helium @xcite , while winds from the frmss and imagbs are suggested for the pollution of light elements and the enhancement of helium @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the total cno abundance in the metal - rich later generation subpopulations would also indicate the contribution by type ii sne ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "considering the order of time required to emerge for these mechanisms , a possible scenario would be as follows : ( 1 ) formation of the first - generation metal - poor ( bluer rgb ) stars from the gas having normal helium and light element abundances .",
    "( 2 ) pollution of the remaining gas by the winds from frmss , which enhance helium and alter the abundance profile of light elements . (",
    "3 ) the most massive ( @xmath35 8 m@xmath50 ) stars then would explode as type ii sne , enriching overall metallicity , including heavy elements and the total cno content .",
    "( 4 ) further pollution of the gas by the ejecta from imagb stars ( @xmath337 m@xmath50 ) would follow , which enhance helium and change light element abundances .",
    "( 5 ) finally , formation of the second - generation metal - rich ( redder rgb ) stars from the gas now enriched in overall metallicity and helium and polluted in light element abundances .",
    "while this scenario can naturally explain the presence of metal - rich and helium - enhanced subpopulations in these gcs , this requires that they were much more massive in the past , because their present masses are too small to retain the ejecta of sne explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that these gcs were once nuclei of primeval dwarf galaxies and then merged and dissolved in the proto - galaxy , as is widely accepted for @xmath0  cen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "note that a significant fraction ( @xmath330% ) of the helium - enhanced subpopulation in these gcs is also best explained if the second generation stars were formed from enriched gas trapped in the deep gravitational potential well of the ancient dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite suggested that ngc  1851 might have formed by simple merging of two gcs having different heavy element abundances initially belonged to a proto - dwarf galaxy .",
    "while this scenario can explain the presence of rgb split and the spread in heavy element abundance without assuming self - enrichment , this is not easily reconciled with one of our main results , which suggests that the metal - rich subpopulation is also enhanced in helium abundance . in this scenario",
    ", it would be difficult to understand why all stars in initially more metal - rich gcs were selectively enhanced in helium abundance , while those in metal - poor gcs were not .",
    "note , however , that this merging scenario might be able to explain the absence of helium enhancement between g1 and g2 in @xmath0  cen ( see  3.1 ) , where g1 and g2 formed by simple merging of two gcs in the central part of a proto - dwarf galaxy , while more metal - rich and helium - enhanced subpopulations , g3 , g4 , and g5 , formed later from the enriched gas trapped in the core of this merged stellar system in a proto - dwarf galaxy . despite many uncertainties , all of the above scenarios are possible only in the primeval dwarf galaxy environment , and",
    "therefore , dwarf galaxy origin of these gcs appears to be inevitable .",
    "we are indebted to the anonymous referee for encouraging us to include the cno enhanced models and to employ parameter estimation technique , which led to several key improvements in the manuscript .",
