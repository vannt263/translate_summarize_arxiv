    "among the important ( yet ill - understood ) diagnostics of stellar nucleosynthesis and the subsequent chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is the @xmath5n/@xmath0n isotopic ratio .",
    "the production of @xmath5n is thought to involve a combination of secondary sources , such as the cold cno cycle in main sequence stars , and primary ones , such as hot bottom burning in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , while @xmath0n is thought to be synthesized almost exclusively as a secondary nuclide , e.g. , through the hot cno cycle associated with nova outbursts .",
    "various sources of @xmath5n and @xmath0n have been incorporated into models of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ; e.g. , tosi 1982 ; romano & matteucci 2003 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "2011 ) , which commonly predict that the @xmath5n/@xmath0n ratio should increase with galactocentric radius .",
    "millimeter - wave emission studies of nitrogen - bearing molecules and their isotopologues in warm dense clouds of the galactic disk have indeed revealed such a trend ( e.g. , dahmen et al .",
    "1995 ; wilson 1999 ; adande & ziurys 2012 ) .",
    "adande & ziurys ( 2012 ) , who examined millimeter observations of cn and hnc in 11 molecular clouds , and reevaluated previous observations of hcn , inferred a nitrogen isotopic ratio for the solar neighborhood of @xmath7 from the gradient seen in their data .",
    "other determinations of the @xmath5n/@xmath0n ratio in the local ism sometimes give quite different results , however , suggesting that the ratios may be affected by chemical fractionation .",
    "hily - blant et al .",
    "( 2013a , 2013b ) found significant differences in the nitrogen isotopic ratios derived from observations of cn and hcn isotopologues in dark molecular cloud cores . an overall ratio of @xmath8 was obtained for cn , while hcn exhibited ratios between 140 and 360 .",
    "the authors interpreted these results as evidence of fractionation and presented model calculations that they propose can explain the observations .",
    "daniel et al .",
    "( 2013 ) studied a suite of nitrogen - bearing molecules and their isotopologues in the dark cloud barnard 1 , finding no evidence for nitrogen fractionation , which they suggest may be linked to the relatively high gas kinetic temperature ( @xmath9  k ) in the innermost part of the b1b cloud .",
    "their molecular abundances were found to be consistent with a @xmath5n/@xmath0n ratio of @xmath10300 for the parental molecular cloud , in agreement with the adande & ziurys ( 2012 ) result obtained for warmer sources in the local ism . for comparison , lucas & liszt ( 1998 ) obtained a nitrogen isotopic ratio of @xmath11 for diffuse molecular gas seen in absorption from hcn toward the extragalactic continuum source b0415@xmath12379 .    in this letter , we present a new approach to estimating the nitrogen isotopic ratio in the local ism ; we report the first detection of c@xmath0n in diffuse molecular gas from an analysis of cn absorption lines in the optical spectra of background o and b - type stars .",
    "specifically , we examine high quality optical spectra of hd  73882 , hd  154368 , hd  169454 , and hd  210121 , which have distances in the range @xmath13  @xmath14  0.21.1  kpc and color excesses of @xmath15  @xmath14  0.31.1 mag .",
    "the diffuse molecular clouds probed by these sight lines have high enough kinetic temperatures ( @xmath16  k ; e.g. , sonnentrucker et al .",
    "2007 ) that chemical fractionation is not expected to be important .",
    "furthermore , the amount of visual extinction through the clouds ( @xmath17  mag ; valencic et al .",
    "2004 ; rachford et al .",
    "2009 ) is small enough that selective photodissociation of n@xmath18 should not play a significant role ( heays et al .",
    "these measurements have the potential therefore to yield the most accurate @xmath5n/@xmath0n ratio to date for material within the solar neighborhood ( @xmath19  kpc ) .",
    "the observations examined here were previously discussed by ritchey et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who studied @xmath2cn/@xmath3cn and @xmath2ch@xmath4/@xmath3ch@xmath4 ratios along 13 lines of sight through diffuse molecular clouds . upon further examination of those data",
    ", it was realized that for four sight lines with very strong cn absorption lines , a weak feature between the main @xmath2cn and @xmath3cn absorption components might be due to the c@xmath0n isotopologue .",
    "the relevant data , acquired using the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) of the very large telescope ( vlt ) , were obtained from the european southern observatory ( eso ) science archive facility and were reduced with the uves pipeline software ( as described in more detail in ritchey et al .",
    "the spectra have very high signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n  @xmath10  12002000 per resolution element near 3875  ) and a resolution of approximately 3.5  km  s@xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "figure  1 presents the vlt / uves spectra for the four directions in the vicinity of the cn @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 ( 0 ,  0 ) @xmath25(0 ) line .",
    "the grey line in each panel indicates the profile synthesis fit originally obtained by ritchey et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . in each case",
    ", it is apparent that there is extra absorption between the main @xmath2cn and @xmath3cn components that is not adequately accounted for by the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the expected isotope shift for the c@xmath0n @xmath25(0 ) line from laboratory spectroscopy is + 0.121  or + 9.4 km  s@xmath20 ( colin & bernath 2012 ; sneden et al .",
    "2014 ) , which is consistent with the position of this weak additional feature ( except in the case of hd  210121 ; see below ) .",
    "however , before we can claim a detection of the c@xmath0n isotopologue , we must first consider the possibility that the extra absorption arises from an additional cloud contributing a weak @xmath2cn @xmath25(0 ) component . to this end , we examined the @xmath26@xmath23@xmath24 ( 0 ,  0 ) lines of ch and ch@xmath4 , which were also covered by the uves spectra ( see figures  2 and 3 ) .    the first step in the analysis was to synthesize the ch lines , including as many weak additional absorption components beyond the main component as were necessary to provide a good fit .",
    "as in ritchey et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we used the profile synthesis routine ismod ( e.g. , sheffer et al .",
    "2008 ) , which determines best - fitting values for the velocities , @xmath27-values , and column densities of the absorption components through an iterative rms - minimizing procedure .",
    "the goodness of fit was evaluated by comparing the residuals to the noise in the continuum regions . after fitting the ch lines",
    ", we reexamined the ch@xmath4 fits from ritchey et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to determine if any additional components needed to be included .",
    "( only toward hd  154368 did we see the need to include an additional weak ch@xmath4 component . ) for these ch@xmath4 syntheses , the @xmath2ch@xmath4/@xmath3ch@xmath4 ratio was held fixed at 74.4 , i.e , the mean value obtained by ritchey et al .",
    "( 2011 ) from mcdonald observatory data .",
    "these fits are not significantly better or worse than ones where the ratio was allowed to vary , illustrating the difficulties one encounters when attempting to derive @xmath2ch@xmath4/@xmath3ch@xmath4 ratios from these vlt / uves spectra ( see ritchey et al .",
    "nonetheless , absorption from @xmath3ch@xmath4 had to be included at some level because in certain cases ( i.e. , toward hd  154368 and hd  169454 ) this absorption overlaps with weak additional @xmath2ch@xmath4 components blueward of the main components .",
    "the next step was to use the component structure derived for ch and ch@xmath4 ( see table  1 ) to determine which of the weak additional components might need to be included in the cn syntheses . in general , we retained only the strongest of the additional ch components if there was evidence of absorption at those velocities in the cn profile . in many cases ,",
    "the components not included have @xmath28(ch@xmath4 )  @xmath29  @xmath28(ch ) , suggesting that the ch in those clouds is associated with ch@xmath4 rather than with cn ( e.g. , zsarg & federman 2003 ) . toward hd  169454 , there is a weak ch component at @xmath30  =  + 16.7  km  s@xmath20 that is shifted by + 10.9  km  s@xmath20 with respect to the main component at @xmath30  =  + 5.8  km  s@xmath20 .",
    "this shift is close to the expected isotope shift of + 9.4 km  s@xmath20 for c@xmath0n .",
    "however , we do not believe that the absorption seen in the cn profile at this velocity is due to an additional component of @xmath2cn .",
    "the cloud in question has @xmath28(ch@xmath4)/@xmath28(ch )  @xmath29  1.0 , and @xmath27(ch )  @xmath29  @xmath27(ch@xmath4 ) , indicating that the ch in this case is ch@xmath4-like rather than cn - like ( lambert et al .",
    "1990 ; pan et al .  2005 ) .",
    "such gas should have very little ( if any ) associated cn .",
    "none of the other sight lines have a ch component that in the cn profile could be mistaken for c@xmath0n . toward hd  210121",
    ", there is a weak ch component shifted by + 8.5  km  s@xmath20 relative to the main component . however , there is no evidence for this component in the cn profile , and , moreover , c@xmath0n is not significantly detected in this direction ( see section  3 ) .",
    "we have made several improvements to the analysis of the cn features in the present work compared to our previous analysis of these spectra ( ritchey et al .",
    "most importantly , we have adopted an updated set of @xmath31-values and wavelengths for all of the relevant cn transitions , using data from the recently - published cn line lists ( brooke et al .",
    "2014 ; sneden et al .",
    "in addition , we now explicitly account for the splitting in the cn @xmath25(0 ) feature , which is a blend of the @xmath32(0 ) and @xmath33(0 ) lines .",
    "we adopt a splitting of 0.0039   or 0.30  km s@xmath20 , with the former line having an @xmath31-value twice that of the latter ( federman et al .",
    "1984 ; brooke et al .  2014 ) .",
    "the isotope shifts for the @xmath3cn and c@xmath0n @xmath25(0 ) features were held fixed at the values derived from laboratory spectroscopy . for @xmath3cn ,",
    "the expected isotope shift is + 0.168  or + 13.0  km  s@xmath20 ( ram & bernath 2011 ; sneden et al .",
    "the column densities and @xmath27-values of the main @xmath2cn absorption components were determined through simultaneous fits to the @xmath25(0 ) lines of the ( 0 ,  0 ) and ( 1 ,  0 ) bands of the cn @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 system .",
    "spectra covering the cn ( 1 ,  0 ) band near 3580   were obtained from archival vlt / uves observations , which generally employed a different instrumental setup and have somewhat lower resolution than the spectra covering the ( 0 ,  0 ) band near 3875   ( see ritchey et al .",
    "the @xmath27-values derived for the main @xmath2cn absorption components were used to fit the corresponding @xmath3cn and c@xmath0n absorption features .",
    "the final component structures obtained for ch@xmath4 , ch , and cn are given in table  1 , where the ch@xmath4 and cn column densities refer only to the dominant isotopologue .",
    "table  2 provides the column densities and resulting ratios of the cn isotopologues for the main absorption components .",
    "uncertainties in the derived column densities account for both photon noise and errors in continuum placement . for the main absorption components ,",
    "the column density uncertainties also include contributions related to the errors in the derived @xmath27-values .",
    "corrections for optical depth are the dominant source of error for the very strong @xmath2cn absorption lines seen here .",
    "ritchey et al .  (",
    "2011 ) discussed the sensitivity of the @xmath2cn column densities to very small changes in @xmath27 .",
    "however , the @xmath27-value related uncertainties were not explicitly included in the errors reported in that paper . here ,",
    "we formally include column density uncertainties based on the errors in the @xmath27-values , which are very well constrained as a result of our simultaneous fits to the strong ( 0 ,  0 ) and weak ( 1 ,  0 ) @xmath25(0 ) lines ( see table  1 ) .",
    "from a careful analysis of the component structure along each line of sight , we find that absorption from the c@xmath0n isotopologue is confidently detected in three out of the four directions studied . for hd  210121",
    ", the extra absorption between the main @xmath2cn and @xmath3cn absorption features is mostly due to an additional component of @xmath2cn , which is apparent in the ch profile as well .",
    "the @xmath34 upper limit on the equivalent width of the c@xmath0n line in this direction is @xmath35(c@xmath0n )  @xmath36  m . for the other directions ,",

    "the weighted mean c@xmath5n / c@xmath0n ratio for the three sight lines where c@xmath0n is detected is @xmath6 .",
    "since the diffuse molecular clouds toward our target stars have relatively high kinetic temperatures ( @xmath16  k ) and the visual extinctions are relatively low ( @xmath17  mag ) , the c@xmath5n / c@xmath0n ratios we derive should not be affected by chemical or photochemical fractionation ( see below ) .",
