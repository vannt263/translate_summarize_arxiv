    ", lusztig constructed a canonical basis for the @xmath0-module @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an irreducible highest weight integrable @xmath0-module with highest weight @xmath1 and @xmath10 is an irreducible lowest weight integrable @xmath0-module with lowest weight @xmath11 .",
    "this basis has many remarkable properties and can be lifted to a basis of the modified quantized enveloping algebra @xmath12 .",
    "since then the canonical basis as well as the corresponding crystal basis of both this tensor product and @xmath12 are widely investigated by many mathematicians e.g. @xcite .    due to the stable property of the basis",
    ", there are quite a few submodules of @xmath8 compatible with the canonical basis , that is , every such submodule is spanned by parts of the basis .",
    "lusztig conjectured further in @xcite that in the case @xmath3 is of finite type there is a composition series of @xmath8 compatible with the canonical basis and he proved the conjecture in the case of type @xmath13 by a direct computation .",
    "later in chapter 27 of @xcite concerning about the based module , lusztig proved that for any integrable @xmath0-module @xmath14 $ ] in category @xmath15 where @xmath16 $ ] is the sum of all submodules of @xmath17 isomorphic to @xmath18 , @xmath19 $ ] is compatible with the canonical basis of @xmath17 if @xmath1 is maximal among those @xmath20 such that @xmath16 $ ] is nonzero .",
    "though not pointing out , lusztig s proof of this result implies the conjecture and provided an inductive construction for the composition series since , in particular , @xmath5 is in category @xmath15 when @xmath3 is of finite type .",
    "the crystal structures of both @xmath5 and @xmath12 are extensively investigated by kashiwara in @xcite . in @xcite lusztig",
    "investigated the two - sided cells in the canonical basis of @xmath12 for @xmath3 of finite type and he raised some conjectures in affine type case which were finally solved by beck and nakajima in @xcite .    in @xcite , a filtration of @xmath21 of @xmath0 was constructed , for @xmath3 which is of affine type and where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fundamental weights .",
    "each @xmath0-submodules appeared in this filtration is generated by the tensor product of @xmath24 with an extremal vector of @xmath25 .",
    "it turns out that all of the @xmath0-submodules appeared in this filtration are compatible with the canonical basis which can be proved using an important lemma due to kashiwara and some results for demazure modules .",
    "motivated by the construction of the filtration in @xcite , we construct the composition series of @xmath4 directly for @xmath3 of any type in the same fashion .",
    "the conjecture by lusztig is then a special case since @xmath26 is also a lowest weight module for @xmath3 of finite type .",
    "this is quite different from the argument in chapter 27 in lusztig s book @xcite and one can derive from our proof the littlewood - richardson rule for decomposing the tensor product @xmath4 into the direct sum of irreducible modules , which is also known by the work of littelmann @xcite .    on geometric aspects ,",
    "quiver varieties were introduced by nakajima in order to get integrable highest weight representations of symmetric kac - moody algebra @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , there is also a geometric construction of tensor product @xmath27 using quiver varieties @xcite . to realize this tensor product , malkin",
    "also introduced in @xcite the tensor product variety . though both constructions are in classical case ( @xmath28 ) , it would be interesting to consider the geometric construction of the composition series using nakajima s quiver variety or malkin s tensor product variety",
    ". we will study this topic in the forth coming publications .",
    "the arrangement of the paper is the following : in section 2 , we recall some basics of the theory of crystal basis and canonical basis . in particular , we recall the construction of the canonical basis of @xmath8 due to lusztig .",
    "next in section 3 , the extended lusztig s conjecture is proved by building up the required composition series explicitly using the theory of crystal basis due to kashiwara .",
    "then we reintroduce the littlewood - richardson rule and compare this composition series with lusztig s inductive construction . finally in the last section",
    "we study the tensor product @xmath5 for any symmetrizable kac - moody algebra @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the connected components of the crystal graph of @xmath29 are completely determined and a composition series of @xmath5 is constructed compatible with the canonical basis when @xmath3 is of affine type and the level of @xmath6 is nonzero .",
