    "all spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plants use the purex process ( plutonium uranium refining by extraction ) , which is a liquid - liquid extraction method .",
    "the organic extracting solvent is a mixture of tri - n - butyl phosphate ( tbp ) and hydrocarbon solvent such as hydrogenated tetra - propylene ( tph ) . by chemical complexation , uranium and plutonium ( from spent fuel dissolved in nitric acid solution ) , are separated from fission products and minor actinides . during a normal extraction operation , uranium is extracted in the organic phase as the complex .",
    "the tbp extractant can form an explosive mixture called red oil when it comes in contact with nitric acid .",
    "the formation of this unstable organic phase originates from the reaction between tbp and its degradation products on the one hand , and nitric acid , its derivatives and heavy metal nitrate complexes on the other hand .",
    "the decomposition of the red oil can lead to violent explosive thermal runaway .",
    "these hazards are at the origin of several accidents such as , the two in the united states in 1953 and 1975 ( savannah river ) @xcite and , more recently , the one in russia in 1993 ( tomsk ) @xcite .",
    "the accidental consequences were the rupture of the equipment , followed by a significant radioactive release to the environment .",
    "this raises the question of the exothermicity of reactions that involve tbp and all other degradation products , and calls for a better knowledge of the underlying chemical phenomena .",
    "tbp is relatively stable , but at elevated temperatures , its degradation may occur , as a result of the following phenomena : radiolysis , pyrolysis , acid catalyzed hydrolysis , as well as the de - alkylation ( see the therein reference for a detailed reaction scheme @xcite ) .",
    "the two last lead to the stepwise formation of degraded organic products such as dibutyl phosphate ( hdbp ) , mono - butyl phosphate ( ) , and ultimately phosphoric acid ( ) .",
    "the reaction by - products ( butanol and butyl nitrate ) may then undergo oxidation to form carboxylic acids and gases . in a similar way , may be decomposed to or . to understand the chemistry of these systems , the knowledge of some physical properties of such species is necessary , such as thermodynamic functions or kinetics rate law of degradation .",
    "however , such data are rather scarce in the available literature . even if there are a plethora of studies on tbp - nitric acid systems ( see reviews @xcite ) , some of the fundamental properties , like standard enthalpies of formation or kinetics of by - product degradations , are poorly known .",
    "only three articles have reported experimental investigations on standard enthalpy of formation of tbp and there is no data for degraded organic products .",
    "these published data were obtained by combustion method in a bomb calorimeter .",
    "starostin  _ et  al._@xcite first studied the tbp combustion with static isothermal calorimeter , the value , was obtained .",
    "later , kindle@xcite reported measurements carried on adiabatic bomb calorimeter targeting the amount of heat of combustion in a nuclear facility for safety analysis .",
    "even if initially the data are not intended for the calculation of enthalpy of formation , an evaluation is possible by supposing a complete combustion : .",
    "the most recent study , carried out by erastov  _ et  al._@xcite derived from rotating bomb calorimeter measurements , the standard enthalpy of formation of tbp ; the value was retained . despite similar approaches , experimental data exhibit a large uncertainty over a range of about .",
    "therefore the aim of our safety strategy of red oil issues is split into several steps where the first investigation is the calculation of standard enthalpy of formation of tbp in the tbp solvent as well as its degraded products , hdbp and .    in the first part of this article ,",

    "however , we noted that the tbp solvent , treated by the cosmo continuum model@xcite , induce only minor changes on the optimal structures of the molecules . hence , gas - phase optimized geometries will be used throughout to compute the harmonic frequencies that enter , without being scaled , the vibrational partition functions at and 0.1  mpa .",

    "[ fig : hnbp ] .    the derivation of unknown formation enthalpies requires to compute reaction enthalpies , which are composed of reaction energies and enthalpic corrections .",
    "the accuracy is mostly determined by the errors in the computed electronic reaction energies with respect to both the basis set ( basis - set error ) and the treatment of electron correlation ( intrinsic error with respect to the exact energy ) , by considering the reactions  [ rxn : hcl : gp ] and  [ rxn : h2:gp ] leading to the formation of the smallest butyl phosphate .",
    "the other di and tributyl phosphate are difficult in this respect due to their size , which makes it impossible to consider huge basis sets very close to complete basis set ( cbs ) limit , at least for the correlated wft methods , although large basis sets are much less prone to basis set superposition errors ( bsse ) . on the other hand , smaller basis sets have to be checked for the remaining basis set incompleteness error ( bsie ) and bsse .",
    "while the bsie can be estimated with extrapolation schemes , the intramolecular bsse is not directly accessible for the investigated formation reactions listed above .",

    "we can thus expect better error cancelations in the former two than in the latter .",
    "let us begin by scrutinizing the results for reaction  [ rxn : hcl : gp ] . with the b3lyp functional , the reaction energy exhibits an unexpected strong basis set dependence with the def2 basis sets .",
    "the reaction energies are not converged with the largest basis set qzvp . extending the def2-qzvp basis set with extra polarization functions ( def2-qzvpp )",
    "has no effect on the computed values .",
    "the other surprising observation is that the aug - cc - pv@xmath1z basis sets also converge slowly to the basis set limit , together with the fact that both def2- and cc - type basis sets lead to cbs values that differ by .",
    "whenever large basis set dependences are observed at the dft level , one may suspect large bsse even with very extended atomic orbital basis that results from numerical instabilities of the dft functionals , as discussed recently by hansen  _ et  al._@xcite this makes us conclude that bsie and bsse effects are crucial with the b3lyp functional for the various reactants and products of reactions  [ rxn : hcl : gp ] and  [ rxn : h2:gp ] . despite the fact that this reaction is isodesmic",
    ", electron correlation effects appear to be significantly different in the two sides of the two reaction equations , thus making error compensations not favorable , and forcing us to push the treatment of dynamic correlation up to the cbs limit .    at the mp2 level , while the def2 basis sets reaction energy values converge very slowly to its cbs limit , the aug - cc - pv@xmath1z basis sets are far less prone to bsie for reaction  [ rxn : hcl : gp ] , being only apart from the cbs level with triple-@xmath0 basis set .",
    "mp2/aug - cc - pv@xmath1z energies for reaction  [ rxn : h2:gp ] converge more slowly to its cbs limit . because the def2-cbs limit significantly differs from the aug - cc - pv@xmath1z one , we cross - checked these results with relativistic ( douglas kroll hess , dk ) correlation consistent basis sets ( aug - cc - pv@xmath1z - dk ) and confirmed the non - relativistic aug - cc - pv@xmath1z values .",
    "we thus infer that the very different bonding around the phosphorous atom in the reactant ( three single bonds ) and in the product ( one double bond , two single bonds and one single ) can not be accurately captured by def2-basis sets .    to push the treatment of electron correlation further , we performed lccsd(t ) calculations extrapolated to the cbs limit as explained earlier in this section .",
    "the resulting reaction energies estimated to the cbs limit are and for reactions  [ rxn : hcl : gp ] and [ rxn : h2:gp ] , respectively .",
    "though we can not compare this value to experimental values , we trust lccsd(t)/cbs results as the best estimate for ccsd(t)/cbs accuracy , and we will see in the next section that this level of theory helps us deriving accurate standard enthalpies of formation .      whenever the molecules considered are in the liquid phase , we have to estimate their thermodynamic properties in the corresponding phase .",
    "while most continuum solvent models only estimate gibbs free energy of solvation , the conductor - like screening model - real solvents ( cosmo - rs ) model@xcite is the only one that allows us to access enthalpies of solvation , which in a pure solvent are strictly equal to the opposite of the enthalpies of vaporization enthalpy , or for a solvated molecule can be extracted as the derivative of the solvation free energy by finite differences with two different temperatures ( 25  , 30  ) .@xcite in order to obtain reliable thermophysical property data with cosmo - rs predictions , accurately optimized structures with corresponding gas - phase and cosmo state ( ideal dielectric continuum by using cosmo with @xmath15 ) energies are necessary.@xcite these are performed with the bp functional of the density@xcite and def - tzvp basis sets.@xcite all statistical cosmo - rs thermodynamic calculations@xcite were performed with cosmotherm,@xcite using the parameter file bp tzvp``c30_1701 '' .",
