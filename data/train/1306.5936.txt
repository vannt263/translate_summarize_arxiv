    "sgrs are sources of short ( @xmath8  ms ) , repeating bursts of soft @xmath9-ray and x - ray radiation at irregular intervals , and share with axps several similarities , like rotation periods clustered between 2 and 12  s , and high magnetic fields .",
    "their observed spindown rates range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and have typical x - ray luminosities in quiescent state @xmath12  ergs@xmath13 .",
    "currently , it is widely accepted that these objects are magnetars @xcite , although there are competing scenarios that challenge this model  see , for instance , the excellent and recent review of @xcite , and references therein .",
    "recently , @xcite , following the pioneering works of @xcite and @xcite , have suggested an alternative model that could explain some properties of these sources .",
    "this model involves highly - magnetized white dwarfs . for this model to be viable the masses of the white dwarfs need to be rather large ( @xmath14 )",
    ", their magnetic fields should range from @xmath15  g all the way to @xmath16  g , and the rotation periods should be rather small , of the order of a few seconds .",
    "the most apparent drawback of this scenario , namely the rotational stability of fast rotating white dwarfs , has been recently analyzed .",
    "specifically , the crucial question of whether rotating white dwarfs can have rotation periods as short as the ones observed in axps has been recently addressed by @xcite , who found that the minimum rotation period of typical carbon - oxygen white dwarfs is approximately @xmath17  s. thus , since axps have rotation periods larger than this value they could be white dwarfs .",
    "the existence of white dwarfs with magnetic fields ranging from @xmath18  g up to @xmath19  g is solidly confirmed by observations .",
    "observations show that most hfmwds are massive , and moreover , that none of them belongs to a non - interacting binary system , pointing towards a binary origin .",
    "however , although long - suspected @xcite , it has only been recently shown that hfmwds might be the result of white dwarf mergers .",
    "sph simulations of the coalescence process indicate that the result of the merger is a white dwarf that contains the mass of the undisrupted primary , surrounded by a hot corona made of about half of the mass of the disrupted secondary .",
    "in addition , a rapidly rotating keplerian disk which contains the rest of the material of the secondary is also formed , as little mass is ejected from the system during the coalescence process .",
    "the rapidly - rotating hot corona is convective and an efficient @xmath20 dynamo can produce magnetic fields of up to @xmath21  g @xcite .    in view of these considerations",
    "it is natural to ask ourselves if such binary mergers could also explain the properties of some axps . here",
    "we explore such possibility for the specific case of the peculiar axp 4u  0142 + 61 .",
    "this axp is by far the best observed source in the near - infrared ( nir ) , optical , and ultraviolet ( uv ) bands and has two characteristics that make it a peculiar object .",
    "the first is that 4u  0142 + 61 presents a confirmed infrared excess @xcite that might be attributed to an accretion disk , whereas the second one is that it is too bright for its cooling age , thus challenging the conventional magnetar model .",
    "here we show that the properties of this axp can be well explained by a model in which the central compact remnant is a massive magnetized white dwarf resulting from the merger of two otherwise ordinary white dwarfs , surrounded by the heavy accretion disk produced during the merger .",
    "to start with , we compute the approximate mass and radius of 4u  0142 + 61 .",
    "the stability of general relativistic uniformly rotating white dwarfs has been recently studied @xcite , and it has been shown that constant rotation period sequences intersect the stability region of white dwarfs in two points that determine lower and upper bounds for the mass , equatorial / polar radii and moment of inertia . in table",

    "[ sec : mag - age ] , the system now behaves as an ejector , inhibiting the accretion of the disk material onto the central white dwarf .",
    "thus , for the second component we adopted the black body disk model of @xcite , which is more appropriate for these systems @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the inclination angle of the disk , which we assume to be face - on , and @xmath37 . in this model the disk temperature @xmath38 varies as @xmath39 @xcite , with @xmath40 the distance from the center of the white dwarf .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in previous studies of 4u  0142 + 61 @xcite the irradiated disk model of has been used instead , but this model is more appropriate for accreting sources .    ,",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "there are upper limits in the @xmath46 and @xmath5 bands , @xmath47 @xcite and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "we also consider the observations of @xcite with the spitzer / irac instrument at wavelengths 4.5  @xmath49 m and 8.0  @xmath49 m .",
    "the fluxes are 36.3  @xmath49jy and 51.9  @xmath49jy , respectively .",
    "we corrected the data for the interstellar extinction , using the estimated distance @xmath50  kpc @xcite and an absorption in the @xmath6 band @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "for the rest of the bands we used @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the extinction in the spitzer / irac bands for @xmath60 are @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xcite . ]",
    "we computed the best - fit of the spectrum parameters , finding @xmath63 , @xmath64  k , inner and outer disk radii @xmath65 , @xmath66 and correspondingly inner and outer disk temperatures @xmath67  k and @xmath68  k , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit4u ] we show the photometric data of 4u  0142 + 61 and our best - fit composite spectrum .",
    "the agreement of the composite spectrum with the observational data is quite good , taking into account that the high variability of the source in these bands can lead to changes in the optical fluxes of up to one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "thus , the white dwarf model is compatible with the observed photometry of 4u  0142 + 61 , as it seems to occur for sgr  0418 + 5729 , swift  j1822.31606 , and 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite .    to check",
    "whether this is a realistic and consistent model for 4u  0142 + 61 , we ran a sph simulation of the merger of a @xmath69 binary white dwarf , which results in a central remnant of @xmath70 , with a radius @xmath71 , in agreement with the photometric value .",
    "we recall that the central white dwarf accretes some material from the surrounding disk ( of mass @xmath72 ) and , thus , shrinks a little",
    ". moreover , the rotation period is @xmath73  s and the moment of inertia of the central white dwarf and the hot corona is @xmath74  g  @xmath29 , which is slightly larger than our maximum estimate  see table  [ tab : bounds ] .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field generated in the differentially - rotating hot corona produced in the aftermath of the merger amounts to @xmath75  g @xcite which amply explains the magnetic field of 4u  0142 + 61 , see sect .",

    ".      the presence of a disk around the magnetized white dwarf plays a key role in the evolution of its rotation period .",
    "this results from a delicate interplay between the interaction of the disk with the magnetosphere of the star , and accretion of disk matter onto the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "a solution of the magneto - hydrodynamic equations including the explicit coupling of magnetosphere - disk system and the mass and angular momentum transfer from the disk to the star is not yet available .",
    "for this reason the torque acting on the star it is often followed using a phenomenological treatment .",
    "we adopt the model of @xcite , which assumes that the magnetic field lines threading the disk are closed . in this model the evolution of @xmath76 is dictated by @xmath77\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\dot{m } r^2_{\\rm mag } \\omega}{i}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic dipole moment , @xmath79^{2/7}$ ] is the magnetospheric radius @xcite , and @xmath80 is the corotation radius . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spindown ] ) describes the traditional magneto - dipole braking , the second one is the star - disk coupling , while the last one describes the angular momentum transfer from the disk to the white dwarf .",
    "we adopt an accretion rate corresponding to a shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xmath81 @xcite . adopting a misalignment angle @xmath82 and integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : spindown ] ) using the parameters resulting from our sph simulation and it results that , for a wide range of magnetic field strengths , at early stages @xmath83 .",
    "thus , initially the star is spun - up due to the large accretion rates  see the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : ppdot ] .",
    "however , after approximately @xmath84  kyr , the inner radius of the disk  which is approximately given by the magnetospheric radius  becomes larger than the the light cylinder radius , @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the disk can not torque any longer the white dwarf , the rotation period reaches a minimum , and from this point on the disk and the star evolve independently , and accretion onto the magnetic poles stops .",
    "thus , the star behaves as a normal pulsar , spinning - down by magneto - dipole radiation @xcite .",
    "the surface magnetic field needed to fit the observed values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 when a mass @xmath88 is adopted is @xmath89  g at an age @xmath90  kyr  see fig .",
    "[ fig : ppdot ] .",
    "this age estimate compares well with the spin - down characteristic age @xmath91  kyr .",
    "moreover , the strength of the magnetic field can be compared with that directly derived using the traditional misaligned dipole expression     +     @xmath92    @xcite  which in our case is valid because @xmath93 ( see sect .  [ sec : photometry ] ) is larger than the radius of the light cylinder @xmath94 . from the observed values @xmath95",
    "s and @xmath96 @xcite , we obtain @xmath97  g for @xmath98 , and @xmath99  g for @xmath100 , in agreement with the result obtained integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : spindown ] ) . additionally , there are other indications that the magnetic field derived in this way is sound . in particular",
    ", the spectrum of 4u  0142 + 61 exhibits a significant drop - off between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands , at a frequency @xmath101  hz , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fit4u ] . concluded that this feature is not due to variability and , moreover , they advanced that it is consistent with the electron cyclotron emission of a magnetic field @xmath102  g. adopting the minimum and maximum masses derived from our model we obtain electron cyclotron frequencies @xmath103  hz and @xmath104  hz , which correspond to wavelengths that fall between the nir and the uv , 0.5 and 176  @xmath49 m , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic field must be closer to the lower value , and therefore that the corresponding mass should be approximately @xmath0 .",
    "actually , it is interesting to realize that although the mass of the remnant of the coalescence is slightly smaller than our fiducial mass for 4u  0142 + 61  @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively  the mass accreted during the spin - up phase is @xmath107 , in good agreement with the mass derived from the photometric solution .",
    "it could be argued that this is the maximum possible accreted mass , since during these early stages super - eddington accretion rates are needed to accrete all the material inflowing from the disk .",
    "nevertheless , during the very early stages after the merger the temperature of the coalesced system is very high , and the emission of neutrinos is not negligible @xcite .",
    "we now compute the cooling age of 4u  0142 + 61 , and compare it with the spin - down age .",
    "as the hot , convective corona resulting from the merger is very short - lived @xcite the evolution of the surface luminosity of the white dwarf can be estimated using mestel s cooling law @xcite : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the average atomic weight of the core of the white dwarf , @xmath110 is the metallicity of its envelope , @xmath111 , @xmath112 @xcite , and the rest of the symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "adopting a carbon - oxygen core and @xmath113 , which is a reasonable value , we obtain a cooling age @xmath114  kyr , in good agreement with the spin - down age .      for a distance @xmath50  kpc ,",
    "@xcite estimated an isotropic x - ray luminosity @xmath115  erg  s@xmath13 , using the unabsorbed x - ray flux @xmath116  erg  s@xmath13  @xmath117 obtained by @xcite .",
    "we use the result of the latest observations of 4u  0142 + 61 with the epic cameras onboard _ xmm - newton _",
    ", @xmath118  erg  s@xmath13  @xmath117 , obtaining @xmath119  erg  s@xmath13 when the same distance is adopted .",
    "the loss of rotational energy associated with the spin - down of 4u  0142 + 61 , @xmath120 gives @xmath121  erg  s@xmath13 for @xmath122 and @xmath123  erg  s@xmath13 for @xmath100 , that cover the estimated x - ray luminosity .",
    "the time integrated x - ray spectrum of 4u  0142 + 61 is well described by a black body and a power - law model with @xmath124  kev and photon index @xmath125 .",
    "the black body component corresponds to a temperature @xmath126 k , which is higher than the surface temperature of a hot white dwarf .",
    "however , these systems may have coronal temperatures much higher than that of the surface @xcite , and thus the x - ray emission would be of magnetospheric origin . because the inner radius of the disk is larger than the radius of the light cylinder @xmath127 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : mag - age ] ) the mechanisms producing such radiation are similar to those of pulsars .",
    "in particular , a possible mechanism was delineated by @xcite , who showed that reheating of the magnetosphere by the bombardment of positrons moving backward to the surface of the star can produce large x - ray luminosities .",
    "positrons are produced the interaction of high - energy photons with ultra - relativistic electrons , resulting in the creation of electron - positron pairs .",
    "following closely the calculations of @xcite we computed the theoretically expected x - ray luminosity of 4u  0142 + 61 .",
    "we found that the reheating of polar caps produces a persistent x - ray luminosity @xmath128  erg  s@xmath13 , in agreement with observations .",
    "nonetheless , there are other possibilities .",
    "if the conventional magnetar interpretation is adopted , the x - ray luminosity would be due to the neutron star .",
    "alternatively , it could also be due to ongoing accretion from a fossil disk onto the neutron star @xcite .",
    "in such cases the white dwarf product of the merger would have accreted enough material to undergo accretion induced collapse to a neutron star .",
    "we studied the possibility that the peculiar axp 4u  0141 + 61 is a massive , fast - rotating , highly magnetized white dwarf , and we explored the viability of this object being the result of the coalescence of a binary white dwarf .",
    "specifically , from its observed rotational velocity we first derived bounds for the mass , radius , and moment of inertia .",
    "afterwards , we fitted the ir , optical , and uv data of 4u  0142 + 61 with a composite spectrum made of two components , a black body and a dust disk , finding a good agreement with the observations .",
    "moreover , we showed that the characteristics of the disk are consistent with the results of a sph simulation of the merger of a @xmath129 binary system .",
    "we then estimated the age and the magnetic field of this axp . adopting the results of our sph simulation we obtained a magnetic field @xmath130  g , and a post - merger age @xmath131  kyr .",
    "the cyclotron frequency of this magnetic field @xmath132  hz would explain an absorption feature observed in the spectrum of 4u  0142 + 61 at @xmath133  hz . furthermore , our age estimate is in excellent agreement with the white dwarf cooling age .",
    "we also showed that the x - ray luminosity of 4u  0142 + 61 can be well explained by the rotational energy loss , and we inferred a theoretical estimate @xmath134  erg  s@xmath13 , which agrees with the observed value , @xmath135  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "all these findings may support the hypothesis that the peculiar axp 4u  0141 + 61 was originated in a white dwarf binary merger ."
