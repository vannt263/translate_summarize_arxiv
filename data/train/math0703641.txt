    "our present results , together with @xcite and additional arguments , imply the following theorem , which will be presented in detail in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "@xcite for all @xmath24 as above , the power series @xmath27 and @xmath28 are resurgent functions .",
    "in particular , it follows that the generating series @xmath27 of the kashaev invariants of the two simplest knots , the @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( corresponding to @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) are resurgent functions .",
    "another application of our exact euler - maclaurin formula is to prove parametric resurgence ( i.e. , resurgence with respect to @xmath11 ) of a formal ( wkb ) solution to a linear difference equation with a small parameter : @xmath33 the formal solution of is of the form : @xmath34 under suitable hypothesis on @xmath35 , theorem [ thm.diff ] below proves resurgence of the above series for @xmath36 fixed , and constructs an actual solution to which is asymptotic to the formal solution .",

    "best known resurgent functions are those that satisfy a difference or differential equation , linear or not ; see for example @xcite and @xcite .    on the other hand , due to the position and shape of their singularities , the resurgent functions @xmath56 of theorem [ thm.1 ] do not seem to satisfy any differential equations with polynomial coefficients .",

    "it seems unlikely that @xmath56 satisfies a linear ( or a nonlinear ) differential equation with polynomial coefficients .",
    "let us point out that theorem [ thm.1 ] implies that the shape of the singularities of @xmath56 is the same as that of @xmath57 .",
