    "in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , without additional theoretical assumptions , the soft  supersymmetry breaking part of the lagrangian@xcite involves a large number of arbitrary parameters .",
    "moreover , many of these parameters may be in general complex , adding new sources of cp violation with respect to the standard model  @xcite .",
    "apart from the many possible phases in the flavour sector which are mostly severely constrained  @xcite , the other  flavour - blind \" possible phases , appearing in particular in the gaugino and/or higgs sector , are essentially constrained  @xcite by the electric dipole moment of the electron@xcite and the neutron@xcite .",
    "as recently emphasized@xcite , large phases in this sector are not excluded at present , although it may be considered as unnatural because it generally requires specific cancellations among the different contributing phases@xcite .",
    "irrespective of a realistic theoretical scenario implying such phases , the latter lead , from a more pragmatic point of view , to potentially drastic changes in the phenomenology of the higgs and gaugino sectors of the mssm , therefore affecting the already challenging reconstruction from data  @xcite@xcite of the structure of the susy and soft - susy breaking lagrangian . typically , assuming that a certain amount of the susy partners may be discovered and some of their masses , production cross - sections and decay widths measured , additional questions arise in the presence of non - zero phases . even without direct measurement of manifestly cp - violating observables ,",
    "one may for example try to determine whether a set of available data necessarily implies the existence of non - zero phases , or conversely whether the data is consistent with the underlying mssm basic lagrangian with phases .",
    "+ in a previous paper  @xcite , we have given a specific strategy and algorithm to de  diagonalize or `` invert '' the parameters in the ino sector , i.e. obtaining some of the mssm lagrangian parameters in direct analytic form in terms of physical parameters ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an early such attempt ) .",
    "however , our construction was restricted to the case of real parameters . in the present paper",
    ", we generalize our procedure to the complex parameter case . while the techniques used are quite similar , especially for the less straightforward 4 @xmath9 4 neutralino mass matrix inversion , the choice of the most appropriate input is obviously different , since the number of input / output parameters is necessarily larger when phases are present . in addition , some peculiarities of the complex case require a slightly different approach . as we shall see , it turns out that the complex case inversion is much more constrained than one may think at first : strong correlations between the chargino and neutralino physical masses occur solely from the structure of the mssm lagrangian , despite the additional phase freedom , and we will illustrate how this somewhat unconventional spectrum inversion algorithm can exhibit in a more direct and clearer way such non - trivial correlations .",
    "for instance , it becomes straightforward in that way to exhibit allowed domains for the neutralino masses , once some of the parameters of the chargino sector are determined ( or vice - versa ) , a task that would usually require rather tedious systematic scanning over the basic lagrangian parameters with painstaking comparisons of physical output results .",
    "for definiteness we shall only consider here the reconstruction of the chargino and neutralino sector parameters with phases , letting aside e.g. the possible implications of non trivial phases on the mssm higgs sector phenomenology , which is somehow decoupled from our analysis and has been investigated recently in refs . @xcite . also , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we emphasize that we are not aiming at a new specific mssm parameters reconstruction method from experimental observables .",
    "clearly an algebraic approach alone can not replace more complete studies of the reconstruction of the mssm parameters from data .",
    "our algorithm should rather be viewed as an efficient tool , to complement any more systematic analysis of the data .",

    "as will be explained , we can choose a phase convention such that @xmath2 is real , so that the counting of physical input versus output parameters is consistent . obviously , any of the latter input",
    ", if not known , may be scanned over some specified range to determine e.g. the resulting allowed domain in the output parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 . as a by - product",
    ", we obtain the neutralino diagonalization matrix elements and therefore the neutralino physical couplings - as direct functions of the masses , and we have recalculated the @xmath16 production cross - section in this framework with complex @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "the neutralino 1,2 pair production cross - section has been widely studied as a very promising detection process at lep2  @xcite or at a future @xmath17 linear collider  @xcite .",
    "the next- to - lightest @xmath18 mass could be measured with good accuracy , and the lightest ( lsp ) @xmath19 as well from chargino decay product  @xcite .",
    "as we shall illustrate , the neutralino pair production measurement should also play an important role in resolving an intrinsic ambiguity in the reconstruction of the @xmath1 parameter from our algorithm .",
    "one should note , however , that prior to our analysis , the precise reconstruction of the chargino masses and mixing angles from actual data will be non trivial .",
    "this issue was recently investigated in details in ref .",
    "@xcite , with another way of reconstructing the @xmath0 and @xmath2 parameters by considering the chargino pairs which can be produced at a future @xmath17 linear collider and studying theirs spin correlation properties .",
    "accordingly , our analysis is very complementary to theirs , in particular for the neutralino sector . + in section 2 , we briefly recall the general parameterization of the gaugino and higgsino sector , and the physically relevant phases fixing our conventions . in section 3 , we discuss the complex chargino and neutralino de  diagonalization algorithm and discuss uniqueness conditions . typical illustrations of the reconstruction of the parameters are given , and in particular the kind of non - trivial correlations that one can glean in the case of partial knowledge of the input .",
    "in section 4 we give analytical expressions for the @xmath20 production cross - section in this general complex @xmath0 , @xmath1 case and illustrate how it can resolve the two - fold ambiguity for @xmath1 , when determined from the neutralino masses alone .",
    "finally section 5 gives some conclusions and outlook .",
    "the relevant gaugino / higgsino part of the unconstrained mssm lagrangian can be found in many different places , see e.g. refs@xcite .",
    "more specifically the soft susy - breaking majorana mass terms : + [ lgaugino ] l_gaugino = - - ^i _ i - ^a _ a + h.c .",
    "have to be supplemented by the supersymmetric @xmath0 term originating from the quadratic part of the superpotential and contributing to the higgsino terms .",
    "writing explicitly for illustration only the terms contributing to neutralinos ( after electroweak symmetry breaking ) :",
    "@xmath21    with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath25 , it is now easy to see from eqs.([lgaugino ] , [ lneutralino ] ) that only the relative phases of say @xmath26 and @xmath27 are physically relevant .",
    "indeed any phase change of @xmath2 in eq.([lgaugino ] ) can always be absorbed by a phase change of the @xmath28 field .",
    "the latter , however , fixes uniquely the phase change of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in eq.([lneutralino ] ) since we assume all vev s and gauge couplings to be real , in such a way that the phases of the combinations @xmath32 and @xmath33 remain unchanged .",
    "we can thus choose , without loss of generality , @xmath34 and real , and @xmath1 and @xmath0 to have arbitrary phases , which fixes our phase convention .",
    "even though no symmetry arguments were invoked here for @xmath35 , one should keep in mind that peccei - quinn and r  symmetries are implicitly needed to assure that phase rotations of the fields , necessary for a given phase convention , preserve automatically the reality of quantities appearing in the pq- and r - symmetry preserving sector of the mssm , such as quark and lepton masses and gauge couplings .",

    "illustrations of such purely theoretical consistency constraints will be given in the next sections .",
    "let us now turn to the de - diagonalization of the neutralino sector .",
    "the question we want to answer analytically here , is how to determine in general @xmath6 and @xmath66 ( as well as two remaining neutralino masses ) , for given @xmath2 , @xmath52 , @xmath45 , @xmath67 and two arbitrary input neutralino masses @xmath19 , @xmath18 , @xmath18 for definiteness and assume them to be the lightest and next to lightest .",

    "it follows that this twofold ambiguity on @xmath1 , intrinsic to the case where only two neutralino masses are input , may in fact be resolved by a study of the corresponding neutralino pair production cross - section which we consider in details in section 4 .",

    "the shape of the different plots is rather generic , and several characteristic features can be noticed .",
    "first , there is the rather important central zone where no solution for @xmath1 exists , corresponding to the consistency constraint ( [ radipos ] ) not being fulfilled . for the input choice in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , this no - solution zone covers about one third of the possible @xmath45 values , which is not so restrictive , but it should be noted that a relatively moderate change in the value of either @xmath101 , ( @xmath3 ) , or @xmath102 may easily reduce considerably the consistent region , and quite often no consistent @xmath1 can be found for any @xmath45 within a relatively important domain of the input parameter space .",
    "this will be illustrated more quantitatively below with  scanning \" plots .",
    "one can already see the sensitivity of the consistency relation ( [ radipos ] ) to those changes in fig 2a , 2b , where a larger @xmath3 and a lower @xmath18 neutralino mass have been chosen .    in the @xmath45 range where @xmath1 solutions do exist , the plots in fig .",
    "1a , b and 2a , b clearly exhibit the twofold ambiguity on @xmath1 ( except obviously at the @xmath45 value(s ) such that @xmath103 , the boarder of the no solution zone , where @xmath1 is unique and the two distinct curves should meet . ) for the input parameter choice in figs . 1 and 2",
    ", one observes that the two solutions are much more distinct for @xmath66 , than for @xmath57 : this is rather generic , although larger differences in the two @xmath57 solutions could occur , for instance for very different @xmath19 , @xmath18 values .",
    "in fact , as is clear from the figures , the order of magnitude of @xmath57 is essentially determined by the values of @xmath44 , @xmath2 ( or @xmath12 ) @xmath104 ( 100 gev ) , while the @xmath45 variation here has a rather moderate influence on @xmath57 .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "1a , @xmath57 varies as a function of @xmath45 roughly between a minimal ( @xmath105 ) and a maximal ( @xmath106 ) value , but that property is somewhat accidentally due to the relatively close values of @xmath44 and @xmath2 chosen here .",
    "when @xmath101 is larger ( or smaller ) , we observed that the consistent values of @xmath1 are very close to the lightest @xmath19 input values , although it is hard to derive a simple generic behaviour .",
    "we will now illustrate the merging of the two separate algorithms described in previous sub - sections 3.1 and 3.2 for the chargino and neutralino sectors .",
    "the outcome is thus the values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath2 , @xmath57 and @xmath66 as direct expressions of the chargino masses and mixing angle @xmath48 , and of the two arbitrary neutralino masses ( plus @xmath3 ) .",

    "the non - trivial correlations among the chargino and neutralino masses appear now explicitly .",
    "first , and rather generically , the domain where both sectors can consistently exist is quite narrow as a function of @xmath48 ( the right boarder zones in fig .",

    "we could obviously have illustrated the same kind of information by choosing for instance one of the physical masses to vary , instead of @xmath48 : the plots would be different but would qualitatively reflect the same strong correlations .",
    "this will be illustrated more systematically in the next sub - section .",
    "we consider now a less optimistic situation where only a partial knowledge of the physical input parameters is assumed , and illustrate the kind of information that can be retrieved in this case . accordingly in figs .",

    "first , in fig.5 we fix the two chargino masses and @xmath108 , and vary @xmath48 between @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( rad ) , which corresponds to the first consistent solution zone in fig .",
    "condition ( [ radipos ] ) implies the pattern of correlation among the physical neutralino masses , represented by the dotted regions (  butterflies \" ) in the figure .",
    "more precisely , a given set of the four neutralino masses is consistent only if any pair @xmath111 of these masses corresponds to a point lying on one of the  butterflies \" .",
    "definite consequences follow from this requirement such as the fact that each of the three allowed branches ( along say the y - axis ) can host only _ one _ pair @xmath111 .",
    "this allows to make qualitative statements about the neutralino spectrum relative to that of the charginos .",
    "for instance , with the specific input chosen in fig.5 , close inspection shows that there should always be one ( and only one ) neutralino heavier than the heaviest chargino , and that @xmath112 gets smaller when @xmath113 gets larger , and vice - versa ( @xmath19 is the lsp and @xmath84 the heaviest neutralino in our conventions ) .",
    "if @xmath3 increases , the dotted butterflies are simply moving up or down along the diagonal @xmath114 line , as illustrated for the choice of parameters in fig .",

    "( for simplicity , we assume a negligible mixing in the selectron sector , so that @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the physical masses ) . although our input parameter choice is particular , the behaviour of the cross - section is rather generic . as a first general observation",

    "9 are functions of @xmath45 but @xmath66 varies also for this input choice , according to our inversion algorithm , as is clear from the corresponding fig .",
    "for instance , for both choices of selectron masses illustrated in the figures , the values of the cross - section vary roughly by about 30 - 40 % when the phases are varied within their maximal possible range , both at lep2 and linear collider energies .",
    "this is not too surprising , since although the two neutralino masses ( and the two selectron masses ) are fixed , there is an important sensitivity to the phases through the @xmath130-neutralinos and @xmath141-@xmath142-neutralino couplings entering the cross - section formula , eqs .",

    "9 , corresponding to the second @xmath1 solution at 190 gev , for @xmath143 100 , 120 gev ) .",
    "these ambiguities on the phases may however be easily resolved when looking at the corresponding values of the chargino masses ( provided the latter are known ) , whose corresponding variation with @xmath45 is illustrated in fig .",

    "the regions with no plots in fig 10 simply correspond to the excluded @xmath48 range from consistency of the inversion , as discussed previously for the plots in figs .",
    "again , the different plots illustrate the generically rather important sensitivity of the cross - section to the phases ( the plots in fig . 10 are functions of the mixing angle @xmath48 , which corresponds for fixed chargino and neutralino masses to varying @xmath45 and @xmath66 , as is clear from the corresponding fig .",
    "3b ) . one should keep in mind that since the mixing angle @xmath48 ( more precisely @xmath147 ) can be in principle determined from the measurement of the chargino pair producion cross - section , plots of the neutralino pair production like in fig.10 may be viewed as a function of the chargino pair production , for fixed chargino and neutralino mass values .",
    "this illustrates further the strong correlations between the chargino and neutralino physical parameters . as for the ambiguities in our inversion algorithm , they come in this case too from the twofold solution in the reconstruction of @xmath1",
    "again , given the generically quite different cross - section values corresponding to the two @xmath1 solutions in fig .",
    "10 , this ambiguity should be easily resolved through the measurement of this observable .",
    "in the present paper , we have derived a purely algebraic algorithm to reconstruct the ( unconstrained ) gaugino sector lagrangian parameters @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , directly from the physical chargino and ( some of the ) neutralino masses .",
    "our construction exhibits in a more direct and systematic way the non trivial correlations among the physical chargino and neutralino physical parameters , which exist even when the maximal possible phase freedom of the unconstrained mssm parameter space is considered , and which may be very hidden or cumbersome to extract in the more standard approach of systematic scanning over the basic parameters .",
    "our approach should be useful in particular in the case where only a subset of the minimal required input is available , and we illustrated with several typical such scenarios the kind of theoretical consistency constraints that could result , in addition to independent experimental constraints .",
    "+ we have also recalculated the neutralino pair production cross - section @xmath58 within our framework and phase conventions , and illustrate its sensitivity to the phases of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which should be in particular useful to resolve an ambiguity in the @xmath1 parameter reconstruction , intrinsic to our algorithm .",
    "a careful comparison of the chargino and neutralino pair production together with the use of the inversion algorithm should also give non trivial correlations among the different chargino / neutralino masses and cross - section observables .",
    "those possible constraints may be studied in a more systematic way , taking into account also the additional direct or indirect constraints from lep data , measurements of the electric dipole moment , etc ... + finally , a refinement of our tree - level algebraic inversion procedure would be to include radiative corrections . however , these corrections are expected to be generically much smaller for the gaugino masses  @xcite than for the chargino pair production cross - section  @xcite , and as such , would probably affect more the reconstruction algorithm of the chargino parameters than that of the neutralino ones .",
