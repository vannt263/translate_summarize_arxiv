    "the two - photon - exchange(tpe ) effect has attracted many interests after its success in explaining the un - consistent measurements of @xmath13 from @xmath14 by rosenbluth technique and polarized methods@xcite .",
    "it is found that the tpe corrections play an important role in extracting the proton s form factors due to its explicit angle dependence .",
    "later some other processes@xcite are suggested to measure the tpe like effects .",
    "the @xmath0 is one of such processes and the two - photon annihilate corrections in this process have been discussed by @xcite where only the @xmath1 intermediate was included .",
    "the estimate by @xcite showed the two - photon annihilate corrections are about a few percent in the magnitude but strongly depend on the hadron production angle . on another hand ,",
    "the calculation in @xcite showed the @xmath5 intermediates also unneglectable in the tpe corrections in the simple hadronic model @xcite .",
    "these researches prompt us to extent the estimate of the two - photon annihilate corrections in @xcite to include @xmath2 intermediate state . in this work ,",
    "we present such results .",
    "considering the process @xmath15 , the born diagram is showed as fig.1 . the differential cross section for this process at the tree level",
    "can be written as@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the angle between the momentum of finial antiproton and initial electron in the center of mass frame .",
    "the sachs form factors have been used as @xmath19    in principle , the form factors at certain @xmath20 can be extracted from the measurement of the unpolarized differential cross section at different angle . to extract the form factors more precisely , the radiative corrections should be considered . among the one loop",
    "radiative corrections , the box and crossed box diagrams play special role due to their strong angle dependence .",
    "this leads us restrict our discussions on the two - photon annihilate correction firstly .",
    "3.0 truein    2.8 truein2.8 truein    using the simple hadronic model developed in @xcite and including @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the intermediate state like fig.2 , the unpolarized cross section can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the contribution of one - photon annihilate diagram and @xmath23 denote the contribution from two - photon annihilate diagrams with @xmath1 and @xmath2 as intermediate state .",

    "both the two vertexes satisfy the conditions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the first condition ensure the gauge invariance of the result and the second condition ensure to select only the physical spin3/2 component @xcite .    for the propagator of @xmath2 ,",

    "can be written as @xmath36 where feynamn gauge invariance has been used .",
    "similarly one can get the amplitude of crossed box diagram with @xmath2 intermediate state .    in the practical calculation",
    ", we take the form factor @xmath37 in the monopole form as @xmath38 in @xmath1 case@xcite @xmath39 the coupling parameters and cut - offs are the same as @xcite @xmath40",

    "the calculations are improved to include both corrections .",
    "as showed in fig.3 , the correction @xmath46 is found to be always opposite to the corrections @xmath47 in all the angle region .",
    "this behavior is similar to the @xmath48 scattering case @xcite .",
    "detailedly , at @xmath49 the absolute magnitude of @xmath46 is so close to @xmath47 which results in the large cancelation and small total correction to unpolarized cross section .",
    "the small @xmath50 and its weak angle dependence suggest the rosenbluth method will work well in this region .",
    "this conclusion is some different with the @xmath48 scattering case where the cancelation is much smaller and the total correction still strongly depend on the scattering angle . at @xmath51 ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of @xmath46 becomes larger than @xmath47 which suggests the important roles played by @xmath5 intermediate state in the process of @xmath0 .",
    "for the polarized observables , fig.4 shows the correction to @xmath42 from @xmath2 is much smaller than @xmath1 and the correction to @xmath6 from @xmath2 is close to @xmath1 .",
    "the former property suggests @xmath5 gives no new correction than @xcite while the latter property increases the two - photon annihilate corrections to @xmath6 which enhances our previous suggestion that the nonzero @xmath6 at @xmath52 may be a good place to measure the two - photon exchange like effects directly .",
