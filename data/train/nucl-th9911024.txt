    "it has been shown that a parity violation experiment to measure the neutron density in a heavy nucleus is feasible .",
    "informations about the distribution of neutrons in nuclei should also constrain the isovector channel of the nuclear matter energy functional . a correct parameterization of the isovector channel of effective nuclear forces",
    "is essential for the description of unique phenomena in exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values . for neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "these include the occurrence of nuclei with diffuse neutron densities , the formation of the neutron skin and the neutron halo . at the neutron drip - line different proton and neutron quadrupole deformations",
    "are expected , and these will give rise to low - energy isovector modes .    in the present work we describe parity violating elastic electron scattering on neutron - rich nuclei in the framework of relativistic mean - field theory .",
    "the ground state density distributions will be calculated with the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model .",
    "this model represents a relativistic extension of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) framework , and it has been successfully applied in studies of the neutron halo phenomenon in light nuclei @xcite , properties of light nuclei near the neutron - drip line @xcite , ground state properties of ni and sn isotopes @xcite , the deformation and shape coexistence phenomena that result from the suppression of the spherical n=28 shell gap in neutron - rich nuclei @xcite , the structure of proton - rich nuclei and the phenomenon of ground state proton emission @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that neutron radii , calculated with the rhb model , are in excellent agreement with experimental data @xcite . in studies of the structure of nuclei",
