    "let @xmath9 be a topological group , and @xmath1 a real or complex separable infinite - dimensional banach space .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the set of bounded linear operators  on @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath11 , @xmath12 be a representation of the group @xmath9 by bounded operators  on @xmath1 . if @xmath13 denotes the borel @xmath14-field of @xmath1 , and @xmath4 is a borel probability  measure  on @xmath1 which is @xmath15-invariant  ( i.e.  @xmath4 is @xmath16-invariant  for every @xmath17 in @xmath9 ) , then @xmath15 naturally defines a probability - preserving action of the group @xmath9 on the probability  space @xmath18 .",
    "recall that the measure @xmath4 is said to have full support if @xmath19 for any non - empty open subset @xmath20 of @xmath1 .",
    "glasner and weiss introduced in the paper @xcite the following notion of a universal representation :    [ defgw]@xcite the representation @xmath21 of the group @xmath9 on the banach space @xmath1 is said to be _ universal _ if for every ergodic  probability - preserving free action @xmath22 of @xmath9 on a standard lebesgue probability  space @xmath3 , there exists a borel probability  measure  @xmath23 on @xmath1 with full support which is @xmath15-invariant   and such that the two actions of @xmath2 and @xmath15 of @xmath9 on @xmath24 and @xmath18 respectively are isomorphic .",
    "recall that @xmath25 is _ free _",
    "if for any element @xmath26 different from the identity , @xmath27 , and _ ergodic _  if the following holds true : if @xmath28 is such that @xmath29 for every @xmath26 , then @xmath30 .    a universal representation of @xmath9 thus simultaneously models every possible free ergodic  action of @xmath9 on a probability  space .",
    "the existence of a universal representation is shown in @xcite for a large class of groups @xmath9 , including all countable discrete groups and all locally compact , second countable , compactly generated groups .",
    "when @xmath31 , the main result of @xcite states thus that there exists a bounded invertible operator  @xmath15 on @xmath32 which is _ universal _ in the following sense : for every invertible ergodic  probability - preserving transformation @xmath2 of a standard lebesgue probability  space @xmath3 , there exists an @xmath15-invariant  probability  measure  @xmath4 on @xmath32 with full support such that the two dynamical systems @xmath5 and @xmath33 are isomorphic .",
    "observe that any invertible ergodic probability - preserving transformation @xmath2 of @xmath34 acts freely on @xmath34 : for any @xmath35 , the set @xmath36 is @xmath2-invariant , and the ergodicity of @xmath2 implies that it is of @xmath37-measure zero .",
    "this definition of a universal operator is thus coherent with definition [ defgw ] .",
    "any of the systems @xmath33 is what is called a _ linear dynamical system _ , i.e.  a system given by the action of a bounded linear operator  @xmath0 on an infinite - dimensional separable banach space @xmath1 .",
    "these systems can be studied from both the topological point of view and the ergodic point of view ( when one endows the banach space @xmath1 with an @xmath0-invariant  probability  measure ) , and we refer the reader to the two books @xcite and @xcite for more on this particular class of dynamical systems .    the result of @xcite , when specialized to the case where @xmath31 , thus says that _ any _ invertible ergodic probability - preserving dynamical system can be represented as a linear dynamical system where the underlying space is a hilbert space , and , moreover , the same operator @xmath15 on @xmath32 can serve as a model for any such dynamical system .",
    "given the apparent rigidity entailed by linearity , the universality result of @xcite in the case where @xmath31 may seem rather surprising .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that a topological version of this result had been obtained previously by feldman in @xcite : there exists a bounded operator @xmath0 on the hilbert space @xmath38 which has the following property : whenever @xmath39 is a continuous self - map of a compact metrizable space @xmath40 , there exists a compact subset @xmath41 of @xmath38 which is @xmath0-invariant and an homeomorphism @xmath42 such that @xmath43 .",
    "the proof of this topological result is rather straightforward , but it already gives a hint at the richness of the class of linear dynamical systems .",
    "a bounded operator @xmath0 acting on the banach space @xmath1 is said to be _ hypercyclic _  if it admits a vector @xmath44 whose orbit @xmath45 is dense in @xmath1 , and _ frequently hypercyclic _  if there exists a vector @xmath44 such that for every non - empty open subset @xmath46 of @xmath1 , the set @xmath47 has positive lower density .",
    "if @xmath0 admits an invariant probability measure with full support with respect to which it is ergodic , then birkoff s ergodic  theorem is easily seen to imply that almost all vectors of @xmath1 are frequently hypercyclic  for @xmath0 .",
    "thus any universal operator is frequently hypercyclic .",
    "let us now say a few words about the construction of universal operators of @xcite .",
    "the universal operators constructed in @xcite are shift operators on certain weighted @xmath7-spaces of sequences on @xmath48 for @xmath49 , or , equivalently , weighted shift operators on @xmath50 .",
    "the proof uses in a crucial way an ergodic theorem for certain random walks of jones , rosenblatt , and tempelman @xcite .",
    "this theorem states in particular that whenever @xmath51 is a symmetric strictly aperiodic probability measure on @xmath48 , the following holds true : for any probability - preserving dynamical system @xmath5 and any function @xmath52 , @xmath49 , the powers @xmath53 of the random walk operator on @xmath48 defined by @xmath54 converge for almost every @xmath55 to the projection @xmath56 of @xmath57 onto the subspace @xmath58 of @xmath59 consisting of @xmath2-invariant functions . this ergodic theorem can be applied for instance starting from the measure @xmath60 on @xmath48 . if @xmath61 is a sequence of positive real numbers such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the weights considered in @xcite are defined by setting @xmath64 for every @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath15 is the shift operator defined on @xmath66 by setting @xmath67 for each @xmath68 , then @xmath15 is shown in @xcite to be bounded , and the ergodic theorem of @xcite is then used to prove that for any function @xmath69 the sequence @xmath70 belongs to @xmath71 for @xmath72-almost every @xmath55 . setting @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the measure on @xmath71 defined by @xmath75 for any borel subset @xmath76 of @xmath71 , it is easy to check that @xmath77 intertwines the actions of @xmath2 on @xmath3 and of @xmath15 on @xmath71 .",
    "the last ( and most difficult ) step of the proof of @xcite is then to construct a function @xmath57 such that @xmath78 is an isomorphism of dynamical systems and @xmath74 has full support .",
    "our aim in this paper is to present an alternative construction of universal operators , which is elementary in the sense that it avoids the use of an ergodic theorem such as the one of @xcite .",
    "it is also more flexible than the construction of @xcite , yields some rather simple criteria for universality , and allows us to show the existence of universal operators on a large class of banach spaces .",
    "moreover , this construction makes it possible to exhibit operators which are universal for _ all _ ergodic dynamical systems , not only for invertible ones . as we will often need to make a distinction between these two notions , we introduce the following definition :    [ def0 ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded operator on a real or complex banach space @xmath1 .    1 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is _",
    "universal for invertible ergodic systems _ if for every invertible ergodic dynamical system @xmath5 on a standard lebesgue probability space there exists a probability measure @xmath4 on @xmath1 with full support which is @xmath0-invariant and such that the dynamical systems @xmath5 and @xmath6 are isomorphic .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is _",
    "universal for ergodic systems _ if the same property holds true for all ergodic dynamical systems @xmath5 on a standard lebesgue probability space .",
    "universal operators in the sense of glasner and weiss are universal for invertible ergodic systems .",
    "when we use simply the term `` universal operator '' in the rest of the paper , we will mean an operator which is universal either for all ergodic systems or just for invertible ones . before stating our main results ,",
    "we introduce the following intuitive notation : suppose that @xmath0 is a bounded operator on a real or complex separable banach space @xmath1 , and suppose that @xmath79 is a sequence of vectors of @xmath1 such that , for every @xmath35 , @xmath80 .",
    "we then write @xmath81 for every @xmath35 .",
    "our first result consists of a general and simple criterion for an operator to be universal for invertible ergodic systems .",
    "[ theo1 ] let @xmath0 be a bounded operator on a real or complex separable banach space @xmath1 .",

    "the vector @xmath82 is bicyclic , i.e.   @xmath83$]=z ; 2 .",
    "there exists a finite subset @xmath84 of @xmath48 such that @xmath85\\neq z$ ] ; 3 .",
    "the series @xmath86 is unconditionally convergent in @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath0 is universal for invertible ergodic systems .",
    "there is a very similar criterion which implies that an operator is universal for all ergodic systems :    [ theo1bis ] let @xmath0 be a bounded operator on a real or complex separable banach space @xmath1 . if @xmath0 satisfies the assumptions of theorem [ theo1 ] , and if moreover the sequence @xmath87 is such that @xmath88 for some @xmath89 ( or , equivalently , such that @xmath90 ) , @xmath0 is universal for ergodic systems .",
    "we have already mentioned that a universal operator is necessarily frequently hypercyclic .",
    "an operator satisfying the assumptions of either theorem [ theo1 ] or theorem [ theo1bis ] is easily seen to satisfy the frequent hypercyclicity criterion of @xcite ( see also @xcite or @xcite ) , and so is in particular frequently hypercyclic and chaotic .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ theo1 ] and [ theo1bis ] largely rely on the ideas of @xcite , but some extra work is needed , in particular in order to cope with the condition ( b ) in both theorems .",
    "the proofs would be simpler if we assumed that @xmath91 ( which is what happens in some of the examples , in particular in those of @xcite ) , but the generality of assumption ( b ) is needed in several of the examples given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ theo1 ] and [ theo1bis ] are presented in section [ sec2 ] , as well as two generalizations of these results ( theorems [ theo1 - 3 ] and [ theo1 - 4 ] ) in which assumption ( a ) is relaxed .",
    "the next two sections are devoted to applications and examples . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we characterize universal operators ( both for ergodic systems and for invertible ergodic systems ) among unilateral or bilateral weighted backward shifts on the spaces @xmath92 , @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "recall that if @xmath95 denotes the canonical basis of @xmath92 , or @xmath94 , and @xmath96 is a bounded sequence of non - zero complex numbers , the weighted backward shift @xmath97 is defined on @xmath92 or @xmath94 by setting @xmath98 and @xmath99 for every @xmath100 . in the same way , if @xmath101 is the canonical basis of @xmath50 or @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is again a bounded sequence of non - zero complex numbers , the bilateral weighted shift @xmath104 on @xmath50 or @xmath102 is defined by setting @xmath105 for every @xmath35 . here is the characterization of universal weighted shifts which can be obtained thanks to theorems [ theo1 ] and [ theo1bis ] :    [ theo2 ] with the notations above , the unilateral backward weighted shift @xmath97 is universal for ( invertible ) ergodic systems on @xmath92 , @xmath93 , if and only if the series @xmath106 is convergent .",
    "it is universal for ( invertible ) ergodic systems on @xmath94 if and only if @xmath107 as @xmath108 .",
    "in the same way , the bilateral backward weighted shift @xmath104 is universal for ( invertible ) ergodic systems on @xmath50 , @xmath93 , if and only if the series @xmath109 is convergent .",

    "this result shows in particular the existence of universal operators for ergodic systems living on any of the spaces @xmath92 , @xmath111 , or @xmath94 . the existence of universal operators for invertible ergodic  systems on @xmath92 , @xmath112 ,",
    "is already proved in @xcite .",
    "a natural question , asked in @xcite , is to determine which banach ( or frchet ) spaces support a universal operator . as a universal operator",
    "is necessarily frequently hypercyclic , and some banach spaces ( like the hereditarily indecomposable spaces , for instance ) , do not support frequently hypercyclic operators , it follows that not all banach spaces support a universal operator .",
    "but , as a consequence of theorem [ theo1 ] , we obtain the existence of such operators on banach spaces with a sufficiently rich structure .    [ theo4 ]",
    "let @xmath1 be a separable infinite dimensional banach space containing a complemented copy of a space with a sub - symmetric basis .",
    "then @xmath1 supports an operator which is universal for all ergodic systems .",
    "this result implies for example that any separable banach space containing a complemented copy of one of the spaces @xmath92 , @xmath93 , or @xmath113 , supports a universal operator .",
    "this is the case for all spaces @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a @xmath14-finite measured space .",
    "if @xmath0 is a bounded operator on a complex infinite dimensional separable hilbert space @xmath32 , it is known ( see @xcite , or ( * ? ? ?",

    "when we write simply that @xmath120 belongs to @xmath128 , this means that @xmath125 is assumed to be the normalized lebesgue measure @xmath129 on @xmath117 .    as a universal operator on @xmath32",
    "is necessarily ergodic with respect to a certain invariant measure with full support ( although this measure is not required to have a second - order moment ) , it is natural to look for conditions involving the unimodular eigenvectors of the operator @xmath0 which imply its universality .",

    "several applications of these two theorems are given in section [ sec4 ] , in particular to adjoints of multipliers on @xmath147 ( example [ example2 ] ) and to the rather unexpected case of a kalish - type operator on @xmath148 ( example [ example4 ] ) .",
    "in section [ sec5 ] we try to exhibit some necessary conditions for an operator to be universal . in this generality , and with the present definition of universality ,",
    "this seems to be delicate .",
    "but if we restrict ourselves to operators acting on a hilbert space , and if we additionally require in the definition of universality that the measure @xmath4 admits a moment of order @xmath149 ( see definition [ definition10 ] ) , then we obtain :    [ theo7 ] suppose that @xmath150 is universal for ergodic systems in the modified sense presented above",
