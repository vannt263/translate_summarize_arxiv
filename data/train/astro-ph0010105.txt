    "in diffusion models of galactic cosmic - ray propagation , cosmic rays are scattered by small - scale fluctuations in the interstellar magnetic field . for cosmic - ray energies below @xmath5 gev",
    ", these small - scale fluctuations can arise from resonant waves that the cosmic rays generate themselves . at higher energies",
    ", it is believed that self - confinement is not possible , because the growth rates of the resonant modes become too small in comparison to the rates at which the modes are damped ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) . for cosmic rays with energies above @xmath6 gev , scattering can result from turbulence that is generated by large - scale stirring of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , which results in a cascade of magnetic energy from large to small scales .",
    "recent studies of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , however , find that the small - scale fluctuations resulting from a turbulent cascade satisfy the inequality @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , respectively , the components of a fluctuation s wave vector @xmath3 and @xmath4 to the background magnetic field @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite )",
    ". this paper explains why fluctuations with this anisotropy are very inefficient at scattering cosmic rays , and presents results from quasilinear theory for the scattering mean free paths resulting from anisotropic mhd turbulence .",
    "the role of molecular clouds in confining and isotropizing cosmic rays when scattering is weak is also discussed .",
    "early studies of mhd turbulence assumed that when a plasma is stirred on some large scale @xmath8 , the cascade of energy from large scales to small scales proceeds isotropically in @xmath9-space ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "more recent studies , however , find that energy cascades efficiently to large values of @xmath2 , but not very efficiently to large values of @xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "( note : if the mean - magnetic field is weaker than the fluctuating magnetic field , then within any stirring - scale cell of volume @xmath10 there is a preferential field direction which can be thought of as the background field @xmath7 for all of the small - scale fluctuations within that cell .",
    "local anisotropy is then determined relative to the direction of @xmath7 within each stirring - scale cell . )",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) have proposed an inertial - range power spectrum for strong anisotropic mhd turbulence in which the magnetic field fluctuations are comparable to @xmath7 : @xmath11 where the dimensionless function @xmath12 is @xmath13 for @xmath14 and rapidly approaches 0 for @xmath15 .",
    "evidence in support of equation  ( [ eq : ms ] ) has been found in direct numerical simulations of mhd turbulence ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) . in this spectrum , there is only power at small scales when @xmath16 . in this region of @xmath9-space , in which turbulence is excited , the linear incompressible alfvn - wave period @xmath17 is greater than the nonlinear energy - transfer time @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the alfvn speed , @xmath20 is the mass density of the medium , and @xmath21 is the rms velocity fluctuation on a perpendicular scale of @xmath22 . because of this inequality , the iroshnikov - kraichnan mechanism for slowing energy - transfer does not apply ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "if the magnetic power spectrum is isotropic in @xmath9-space or possesses slab symmetry ( in which the wave vectors of fluctuations are @xmath3 to @xmath7 ) , then cosmic - ray scattering is dominated by magnetostatic gyroresonant interactions , in which the cosmic ray and fluctuation satisfy the resonance relation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the component of a cosmic ray s velocity along @xmath7 , @xmath25 is a non - zero integer ( @xmath26 for slab symmetry ) , and @xmath27 is the cosmic ray s gyrofrequency . in the general resonance relation ,",
    "the linear wave frequency @xmath28 appears on the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : msgr ] ) .",
    "it is neglected here since for incompressible alfvn waves @xmath29 , which is @xmath30 unless the angle between a cosmic - ray s velocity vector @xmath31 and @xmath7 , the pitch angle , is very close to @xmath32 .",
    "if a cosmic ray s pitch angle is nt too close to @xmath33 , @xmath32 , or @xmath34 , then equation  ( [ eq : msgr ] ) implies that the fluctuations that dominate scattering satisfy @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a cosmic ray s gyroradius and @xmath37 is the component of @xmath38 @xmath4 to @xmath7 .",
    "however , if @xmath39 , where @xmath8 is the scale at which the turbulence is stirred , and if the turbulence has the type of anisotropy described by equation  ( [ eq : ms ] ) , then the only fluctuations with @xmath35 have @xmath40 , as depicted in figure 1 .",
    "but if @xmath41 , then during a single gyro orbit a cosmic ray traverses many uncorrelated turbulent fluctuations of the required @xmath1 .",
    "the contributions from these different fluctuations tend to cancel , resulting in highly inefficient scattering .",
    "scattering rates have been calculated for turbulence with a power spectrum described by equation  ( [ eq : ms ] ) in the quasilinear approximation ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath42 and @xmath43 then when @xmath44 the coefficient of spatial diffusion along the magnetic field resulting from the quasilinear scattering rates is given by ( @xcite @xcite ) @xmath45 this value is far too large to explain confinement of cosmic rays to the galaxy .",
    "thus , some mechanism besides turbulence described by equation  ( [ eq : ms ] ) must be invoked to explain cosmic - ray confinement . for cosmic rays with",
    "energies less than @xmath46 gev , waves excited by the cosmic rays may provide the confinement . for higher energy cosmic rays for which self confinement does not appear possible ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite )",
    ", molecular - cloud magnetic mirrors may play an important role .",
    "it should be noted that equation  ( [ eq : kappap ] ) applies to both cosmic - ray nuclei and electrons .",
    "molecular - clouds are characterized by a range of sizes , masses , and densities .",
    "cloud mass spectra obey power - law scalings over several decades of cloud masses , and a power - law mass - size relation also holds over a range of scales ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) has proposed a useful quasi - fractal model for this hierarchy of structure , with smaller , denser objects nested within structures that are larger and more diffuse . using straightforward rules to generate fractal structures , elmegreen estimates through numerical modeling that a line - of - sight through a fractal molecular cloud complex has a @xmath47 chance of entering dense molecular material , and a @xmath47 chance of passing through a hole in the fractal complex filled with diffuse matter .",
    "elmegreen interprets the standard 8 large absorption lines per kpc ( @xcite @xcite ) as evidence for an average of 3 fractal cloud complexes per kpc along a typical line of sight . because of the 50% see - through probability , however , photons can travel @xmath48 pc without entering molecular material . the 8 absorption lines per kpc are then not spaced at even distances along a line of sight , but rather are clustered in groups of @xmath49 per cloud complex .    because magnetic field lines are focused into strong - field regions , and because the magnetic field is stronger within molecular clouds than in the icm , a magnetic field line passing through a cloud complex has a higher probability of entering molecular material than a straight line of sight ( figure  2 ) . if the mean field strength within the molecular material is @xmath50 times the typical field strength in the icm , and if 50% of the lines - of - sight through the complex intersect molecular material , then one would expect a fraction @xmath51 on the order of @xmath52 of the magnetic flux ( and , therefore , field lines ) through the complex to pass through molecular material .",
    "the line - of - sight average of a cloud s magnetic field can be obtained through zeeman splitting .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) report zeeman measurements of molecular - cloud field strengths ranging from 9 @xmath53 g to 120 @xmath53 g .",
    "the typical field strength in the icm is @xmath54 @xmath53 g ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath50 is thus fairly large , and @xmath51 is close to 1 .",
    "moreover , due to magnetic focusing , the spacing of cloud complexes along field lines may be smaller than the @xmath55-pc spacing of complexes along straight lines .",
    "on the other hand , tangling of field lines in the icm may tend to increase the spacing of successive cloud complexes along a given field line as measured along that field line .",
    "it seems reasonable , however , to take the typical distance between cloud complexes as measured along a field line to be @xmath56    once inside a molecular cloud , field lines tend to be focused into dense clumps where the field strength is larger than the average field strength in the cloud .",
    "a range of observations suggests that at particle densities @xmath25 above @xmath57 , the magnetic field strength @xmath58 scales as ( @xcite @xcite ) @xmath59 according to @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mass of a clump of linear dimension @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the number of clumps with linear dimension @xmath62 in the interval @xmath64 .",
    "since the flux through a clump is @xmath65 , equations  ( [ eq : bn ] ) through ( [ eq : dndr ] ) imply that the total flux @xmath66 through clumps with linear dimension between @xmath62 and @xmath67 scales as @xmath68 that is , there is more flux through the smaller , denser clumps than through the cloud complex as a whole .",
    "this means that as a single field line passes through a complex , it must on average pass through several of the densest clumps described by the power - law scalings , clumps in which the magnetic field strength is large .",
    "if @xmath69 is the field strength in the icm and @xmath70 is the maximum field strength encountered by a cosmic ray in a molecular - cloud complex , then the cosmic ray will be magnetically reflected by the cloud complex provided that its pitch - angle cosine @xmath71 in the icm as it approaches the complex satisfies the inequality @xmath72 where @xmath73 the above discussion suggests that @xmath74 , and thus molecular clouds can magnetically reflect a large fraction of cosmic rays .",
    "when the scattering mean - free path @xmath75 is much greater than @xmath76 , cosmic rays travel between molecular clouds without significant scattering .",
    "phase - space orbits of cosmic rays in this weak - scattering limit are depicted in figure 3 , where @xmath77 .",
    "particles with @xmath78 close to 1 are not magnetically reflected and can pass through molecular clouds",
    ". trapped cosmic rays move on closed orbits in the @xmath79-@xmath80 plane , where @xmath79 is distance along a field line .",
    "the way in which molecular - cloud magnetic mirrors affect cosmic - ray transport depends upon cosmic - ray energy and also the efficiency of cosmic - ray scattering .",
    "approximate coefficients of diffusion perpendicular to the galactic plane have been calculated for several different propagation regimes ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "broadly speaking , cosmic rays can escape from magnetic traps in one of two ways , by scattering into the passing region of phase space and then traveling along the magnetic field through a molecular cloud , or by drifting perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the second case is depicted in figure 4 : a cosmic ray initially trapped between clouds a and b can drift perpendicular to the magnetic field and end up trapped between clouds a and d.    because molecular clouds are confined to the galactic disk , it is possible that they have no affect on cosmic - ray propagation in the halo . on the other hand ,",
    "if the magnetic field lines in the halo possess numerous arcs that are anchored down to the disk on either end ( analogous to closed field lines in the solar corona ) , then molecular cloud magnetic mirrors may affect propagation in the halo to some extent .",
    "one of the sources of cosmic - ray anisotropy is the flow of cosmic rays along the magnetic field . because molecular - cloud magnetic mirrors impede this flow , they reduce the level of anisotropy for any given level of weak scattering",
    ". values of the harmonics of the cosmic - ray distribution function ( as functions of the scattering rate , @xmath81 , and @xmath76 ) are given by @xcite ( @xcite ) under the assumption that the pitch - angle scattering frequency is weak and independent of pitch angle .",
    "when scattering is weak , the density of cosmic rays within molecular clouds @xmath82 is determined by two competing effects . on the one hand ,",
    "cosmic rays are reflected as they approach cloud complexes , which tends to reduce @xmath82 .",
    "on the other hand , magnetic field lines are brought closer together in high - field regions , which acts to increase @xmath82 since cosmic rays travel primarily along the magnetic field .",
    "it can be shown that when energy losses are neglected , these two effects cancel ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this point is important since if @xmath82 were in fact less than @xmath83 , there would be a corresponding reduction in spallation and diffuse gamma radiation for a fixed average energy density of cosmic rays throughout the galaxy .",
    "( for sufficient ionization losses at low cosmic - ray energies , it should be noted that the value of @xmath82 can be reduced below the cosmic - ray density in the intercloud medium @xmath84 . )",
    "the two competing effects described above are illustrated graphically in figure  5 .",
    "each of the two narrow flux tubes in figure  5 has a bounding surface that is everywhere parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the cross - sectional area of each tube is proportional to @xmath85 , where @xmath58 is the field strength . since motion perpendicular to the magnetic field",
    "is suppressed , the cosmic rays within each flux tube to a good approximation remain within their respective flux tubes as they move along the field . because of magnetic mirroring , the number of cosmic rays per unit length within a flux tube decreases in high - field regions . however , because the cross - sectional area of the flux tube also decreases , the number of cosmic rays per unit volume stays the same .",
    "at this stage , it is difficult to determine from observations whether molecular clouds play a role in cosmic ray confinement .",
    "although the observed energy dependence of the cosmic - ray path length at cosmic ray energies @xmath86 gev provides important information on propagation at energies @xmath86 gev , almost nothing is known about the path length at the energies above @xmath6 gev at which self - confinement appears to break down and at which confinement may depend upon molecular clouds .",
    "there appear to be three main possibilities .",
    "first , molecular clouds may help confine cosmic rays at energies above @xmath6 gev as described in this paper .",
    "second , the arguments that self - confinement breaks down at energies above @xmath6 gev may be incorrect .",
    "third , interstellar turbulence generated by large - scale stirring may possess features not described by the goldreich - sridhar theory that allow for stronger scattering .",
    "recent investigations into mhd turbulence are providing new and important results on the anisotropy of the small - scale fluctuations that result from a cascade of magnetic energy from large to small scales . as discussed in this paper ,",
    "anisotropic small - scale fluctuations are inefficient at scattering cosmic rays . for cosmic rays with",
    "energies less than @xmath87 gev , resonant waves excited by streaming cosmic rays are believed to be sufficient to confine cosmic rays to the galaxy regardless of the nature of the cascade in mhd turbulence . at higher energies",
    ", however , it is believed that such self - generated waves are insufficient .",
    "thus , if scattering by the turbulence that is generated by large - scale stirring of the ism is inefficient , then some additional mechanism is needed to confine and isotropize cosmic rays at energies above @xmath88 gev . such a mechanism may be provided by molecular - cloud magnetic mirrors .",
