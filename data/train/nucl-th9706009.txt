    "pion production / absorption on nuclear systems represents a complex , challenging problem , and this fact has been known since many years . in the attempt to explain the multitude of experimental results collected over more than 40 years by now , many different theoretical approaches have been proposed so far , with the aim to improve our understanding of these reactions and , more generally , of the hadronic phenomena .    the simplest approaches which have been employed assume a one  nucleon mechanism originated by the @xmath2nn vertex ( generally  but not always  a galilei invariant non relativistic reduction of the usual @xmath7 pion ",
    "nucleon interaction ) and recast the transition amplitude in a dwia formalism where the many  body aspects can be treated with different levels of approximations @xcite . first ",
    "order corrections from the @xmath2-nucleus multiple scattering series leads to the two  nucleon mechanisms where a pion emitted from one nucleon scatters from another before leaving the whole nucleus .",
    "the non  perturbative character of the hadronic interactions , together with the energy  momentum mismatch which forbids absorption on single , free nucleons and suppresses one  nucleon absorption on bound nucleons , makes these rescattering effects an important aspect which can not be ignored for the reproduction of low  energy data . at the @xmath1resonance , however , most of the assumptions used in the early calculations were not applicable , and other phenomenological approaches have been developed .",
    "a relevant success was encountered by the  deuteron \" model , originally employed by ruderman@xcite , where the @xmath8 cross section is directly linked to the @xmath9 experimental cross section , by means of suitable nuclear structure functions .",
    "this method has the considerable advantage to disentangle the question of the choice of the correct interaction mechanisms from the knowledge of the bound state wavefunctions .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties about the interaction mechanisms at the resonance are simply bypassed through the employment of the experimental @xmath10 cross section .",
    "the approach has been later refined by several authors , which soon addressed their attention to the main issues such as the role of the distortion effects , sensitivity of the results with respect to the available model wave  functions , and generalization of the formalism from three  baryon systems to the many ",
    "nucleon @xmath11 case .",
    "a partial but representative sample of works developed along these lines is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "more recently , the analysis of the @xmath11 reaction in terms of the @xmath12 process has been extended to spin observables by falk @xcite , by using the @xmath12 amplitude analysis of bugg _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , rather than the averaged cross  section data of earlier works . in most cases ,",
    "an overall fair , qualitative agreement with the trend of the large bulk of experimental data has been found , indicating that the deuteron model even in its spin  dependent version may be considered a starting point for phenomenological studies which include spin  polarization data .",
    "this kind of approaches , however , suffers from a number of problems which limits possible future refinements and demands for more appropriate theoretical formulations .",
    "first , the model considers nn production mechanisms limited to the ( dominant ) @xmath13 isospin transition , while a complete model should take into account also the effects in the remaining isospin channels .",
    "second , the amplitudes used for input are on  shell quantities , while in the theory the off  shell effects should be taken into account .",
    "third , there is a certain arbitrariness in the kinematical constraints which define the energy parameter for the evaluation of the input 2n production amplitude ; because of that , the results are not uniquely determined . and",
    "finally , in practically all applications the distortion contributions are in danger of double countings ; indeed , in the evaluation of the distortion effects one should subtract the distortion contributions on the active pair , which are already included in the @xmath12 data .    to overcome these limitations , and to challenge the validity of the  deuteron \" approaches ,",
    "there has been a number of papers where more microscopic models have been suggested@xcite . here ,",
    "the dynamical input was not mediated or hidden by the cross ",
    "section data , but consists of non  relativistic interactions among pions , nucleons , and isobars . in particular , the coupled @xmath1n dynamics is obtained through the solution in r  space of the two  baryon schrdinger equation .",
    "first calculations@xcite employed simple s  wave deuteron and triton wave  functions of uncorrelated gaussian forms , and were extremely limited in the number of intermediate states included in the calculation .",
    "subsequent analyses @xcite used better parameterizations ( including @xmath6 states ) for the nuclear wave  functions , and increased slightly ( from 1 to 4 or 5 ) the number of two  body angular  decomposed intermediate states , finding that these aspects improve the calculated angular distributions without , however , finding an agreement with theory and experiments , especially for the results at large angles , where considerable discrepancies persist .",
    "one of the conclusions from these studies was that these microscopic calculations needed important improvements in order to give a good reproduction in the normalization and in the angular distributions , and that these improvements would lead to enormous complications in the theoretical evaluation of the observables .    in an attempt to go beyond the description of meson production in terms of single  nucleon and two  nucleon mechanisms @xcite",
    ", it was shown that meson double rescattering could be a good candidate to account for the discrepancies at backward angles , particularly in the energy region above the @xmath1resonance .",
    "however , the bulk results , while moving towards the right direction , were still far from being optimal and this again poses the question of the need to overcome the various technical approximations which had to be assumed to keep the calculation tractable .",
    "the study has the merit to address the attention to the problem of three  body mechanisms in meson production / absorption , and this is still an open question which we hope will be theoretically disentangled in the near future with the help of the results collected in recent years by pionabsorption experiments with large angular detector systems @xcite and by making comparative analyses in the @xmath1 region with the phenomenology of @xmath14he photodisintegration @xcite .    in this paper , we have calculated the excitation function and differential cross ",
    "section for the @xmath15 reaction in the @xmath1 region by using single ",
    "nucleon and two  nucleon mechanisms .",
    "in particular , the two  nucleon mechanism explicitly refers to the intermediate isobar excitation with @xmath2+@xmath3 exchange @xmath1n  nn transitions with tensor components .",
    "the one  body mechanism is mediated by the @xmath2nn vertex , while the two  body process is triggered by the @xmath16n one .",
    "the two mechanisms have been decomposed in complete three  nucleon partial waves , while the asymptotic pion  nucleus plane wave has been kept three  dimensional .",
    "this choice leads to matrix elements with a large number of couplings between different three ",
    "body states and the technical complications involved has been kept under control with a great deal of numerical analysis .",
    "also the intermediate three  baryon ( @xmath1nn ) state has been represented in partial waves with inclusion of angular momenta up to @xmath17 for the @xmath1n subsystem .",
    "however , in preliminary test calculations @xcite , the quality of the convergence has been checked up to @xmath18 .",
    "the antisymmetrization prescription for the three nucleons has been fully taken into account via the formalism of the permutation operators @xcite and brings into the theory further mechanisms which differ from the leading ones by exchange diagrams .",
    "the matrix elements of the symmetrization permutator @xmath19 involve a large number of couplings between different three  nucleon partial waves , and rather than invoking a drastical reduction of the number of states , we have accepted to deal with the numerical difficulties implied by the approach .",
    "following the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite we have embedded these absorption operators in a faddeev  based treatment of the three  nucleon dynamics .",
    "accurate bound ",
    "state wavefunctions have been obtained with high  rank faddeev ",
    "ags calculations , and a suitable generalization of the quasiparticle method to absorption processes has been formulated in order to take into account the three ",

    "this continuum calculation has been performed in the rank ",

    "because of the above mentioned reasons , we think that the treatment illustrated in this work achieves several improvements with respect to the previous , pioneering , microscopic analyses . we have devoted section ii to further discussions on these and other important aspects of our calculations , such as the treatment of the @xmath1 mass and width in the intermediate three  body ( @xmath1nn ) green s function , and the inclusion of off  shell effects ( for this second aspect , see also the discussion at the beginning of sect .",
    "iii ) . the remaining part of sect .",
    "iii compares the results of our analysis with experiments and sect .",
    "iv contains a brief summary and the conclusions .",
    "we express the transition amplitude for the @xmath22 reaction by the following matrix element    @xmath23 represents the three  nucleon bound  state ( bs ) and @xmath24 the three  body continuum state with ingoing boundary condition and with the deuteron @xmath6 in the asymptotic channel .",
    "both states are assumed to be properly antisymmetrized in the nucleonic coordinates and the state @xmath25 is the pion  nucleus three  dimensional plane wave . in a previous exploratory calculation @xcite the bound  state wavefunction calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "that wavefunction originally was determined in ref.@xcite by solving the faddeev equation with the paris potential and with explicit allowance of the @xmath1 degrees of freedom and consisted of 48 three ",
    "baryon partial waves , of which 22 refer to purely nucleonic states . because of the smallness of the remaining isobar states ,",
    "only the nucleonic states were retained in the calculation of ref.@xcite . in the present calculation , we have independently recalculated the three  nucleon bound state for various realistic nuclear potentials , and the details of these calculations are illustrated in subsection [ 3nbs ] .",
    "the absorption mechanisms are specified by the operator @xmath26 . to avoid double countings",
    ", we avoided purely nucleonic intermediate states in @xmath26 .",
    "this is because we calculate the final  state interactions among the three nucleons using realistic nn potentials , without performing any kind of subtraction in the nuclear potential .    in this study",
    "we consider absorption mechanisms generated by pion ",
    "nucleon interactions in @xmath5 waves as described by the @xmath2n@xmath1 and @xmath2nn vertices .",
    "the nonrelativistic interaction hamiltonians are    @xmath27    for the @xmath2n@xmath1 interaction , and    @xmath28    for the @xmath2nn one . here , the baryonic density is denoted by @xmath29 , while @xmath30 is the pionic isovector field .",
    "the quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the nucleon and pion masses , respectively , while @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the nucleon spin and isospin operators , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the corresponding generalization to the isobar ",
    "nucleon transition .",
    "the @xmath2nn vertex defines the simplest one  body absorption mechanism and is sometimes referred to as the impulse approximation ( ia ) mechanism .",
    "however , this is suppressed because of energy ",
    "momentum mismatch , therefore two  nucleon mechanisms dominate .",
    "these are taken into account through the @xmath1rescattering process , where the @xmath2nn  nn inelasticities are modeled through a @xmath2n@xmath1@xmath1n  nn two - step transition . here the first transition is triggered by the @xmath2n@xmath1 vertex given above , followed by an intermediate @xmath1n propagation and by the @xmath1n  nn transition .",
    "the intermediate propagation of the isobar is described by the green s function    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is given by the pion energy plus the target kinetic energy in the c.m .",
    "the jacobi variables @xmath5 and @xmath39 are the pair @xmath1n and spectator nucleon momenta , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the reduced masses of the pair and spectator  pair systems .",
    "@xmath42 is the isobar  nucleon mass gap .",
    "since the @xmath1isobar is not a stable particle but a resonance , its mass is endowed with an imaginary part @xmath43 , associated to the decay width of the isobar    @xmath44    with @xmath45 = 1232 ( mev ) and @xmath46 being the energy ",
    "shift parameter .",
    "the energy dependence for @xmath47 has been modeled phenomenologically in a previous analysis of the @xmath48 reaction@xcite .",

    ", the @xmath51@xmath52 transition potential can be obtained from the @xmath2 and @xmath3exchange diagrams    @xmath53    the operator @xmath54 is the baryon ",

    "each meson  baryon coupling in the transition potential has been endowed with a phenomenological form factor of monopole type , with the exclusion of the @xmath59 coupling , where a dipole",
    " type form factor was assumed .",
    "finally , we discuss how the three ",
    "nucleon dynamics can be incorporated into the theory , or equivalently , how we calculate @xmath60 .",
    "the method is similar to previous procedures developed to incorporate final  state interactions ( fsi ) in the photodisintegration of three  body systems @xcite .",
    "first , we introduce the operator @xmath61 which exchanges spin , isospin and position coordinates of nucleons 2 and 3 .",
    "we then introduce the cyclic and anti ",
    "cyclic permutation operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "they exchange the global coordinates of the three nucleons in the following manner @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and can be expressed in term of the pair exchange operators as @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this leads to the full permutator    @xmath68    and the normalized symmetrizer @xmath69 .",
    "it is now possible to derive the complete wavefunction in terms of the asymptotic channel wavefunction @xmath70 ( the subscript  1 \" denotes antisymmetrization with respect to the pair made of nucleons labeled  2 \" and  3 \" )    @xmath71    where the three  body operator @xmath72 satisfies a faddeev  like equation    @xmath73    ( @xmath74 is the two ",

    ", we use a similar scheme for pion absorption on the three  nucleon systems .    in order to accomplish this",
