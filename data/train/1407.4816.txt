    "the time evolution of isolated quantum systems out of equilibrium has been explored for many decades .",
    "the subject is strongly connected with the derivation of the energy - time uncertainty relation  @xcite , since the lifetime of a decaying state is bounded by the reciprocal of the energy uncertainty .",
    "it has been central to studies of unstable systems , sometimes in relationship with quantum chaos and notions of quantum ergodicity  @xcite .",
    "it is at the heart of progresses in quantum information and the development of methods to control the dynamics of quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has become an important topic for experiments in optical lattices , where many - body quantum systems can evolve coherently for long times  @xcite , and related theoretical studies  @xcite .    here",
    ", we analyze the probability to find an isolated interacting quantum system in its initial state later in time .",
    "this probability , often called nondecay probability , return probability , or survival probability , is denominated here as fidelity .",
    "the picture considered is that of an instantaneous quench , where the system is initially in an eigenstate of an initial hamiltonian @xmath0 and the dynamics is launched by changing @xmath0 abruptly into a new final hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the fidelity is obtained by fourier transforming the weighted energy distribution of the initial state .",
    "this distribution is known as the local density of states ( ldos ) or strength function .",
    "the fidelity decay is exponential when the ldos has a lorentzian ( also known as cauchy or breit - wigner ) form .",
    "this is the common behavior in open systems  @xcite , although algebraic contributions at long times have been predicted as early as 1958 @xcite .",
    "they are caused by the lower cutoff in the energy distribution .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that in isolated interacting quantum systems , various deviations from the lorentzian shape may occur .",
    "we present three realistic cases that lead to nonexponential decays .",
    "the paradigmatic interacting quantum systems used for the illustrations are one - dimensional spin-1/2 models .",
    "_ case ( 1)_. in previous works  @xcite , we emphasized that in the limit of strong global perturbation , the ldos becomes gaussian , which causes a gaussian fidelity decay .",
    "such behavior , even at long times , had been discussed before  @xcite .",
    "we showed that it can in fact persist all the way to saturation independently of the regime ( integrable or chaotic ) of the system .",
    "we now extend those analyses , concentrating on the transition region from lorentzian to gaussian and on the deformations that the gaussian distribution undergoes as the energy of the initial state moves away from the center of the spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "the two other cases explored give rise to fidelity decays that are even faster than gaussian .",
    "_ case ( 2)_. the matrix elements of the final hamiltonian associated with the spin flip - flop terms ( excitation hopping ) between second and further neighbors are randomized .",
    "this , at first sight , very sparse random matrix leads to a semicircular ldos and to a fidelity behavior involving a bessel function of the first kind .",
    "this decay is very similar to that found when @xmath1 is a full random matrix .",
    "_ case ( 3)_. contrary to the cases above , where the ldos is unimodal , the third scenario corresponds to a bimodal distribution where the two peaks are far in energy .",
    "the initial fidelity decay reaches the quantum limit as established by the energy - time uncertainty relation , following a cosine squared function .",
    "the two peaks are created by adding to the initial spin-1/2 hamiltonian a local and very strong static magnetic field that splits the spectrum of the final hamiltonian in two .",
