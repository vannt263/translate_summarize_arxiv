    "<S> generation of anomalously energetic suprathermal electrons was observed in simulation of a high - voltage dc discharge with electron emission from the cathode . </S>",
    "<S> an electron beam produced by the emission interacts with the nonuniform plasma in the discharge via a two - stream instability . </S>",
    "<S> efficient energy transfer from the beam to the plasma electrons is ensured by the plasma nonuniformity . </S>",
    "<S> the electron beam excites plasma waves whose wavelength and phase speed gradually decrease towards anode . </S>",
    "<S> the short waves near the anode accelerate plasma bulk electrons to suprathermal energies . </S>",
    "<S> the sheath near the anode reflects some of the accelerated electrons back into the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons travel through the plasma , reflect near the cathode , and enter the accelerating area again but with a higher energy than before . </S>",
    "<S> such particles are accelerated to energies much higher than after the first acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism plays a role in explaining earlier experimental observations of energetic suprathermal electrons in similar discharges .    </S>",
    "<S> the collisionless relaxation of high - current electron beams and plasma jets is important for many applications : solar disruptions @xcite , collective stopping of intense electron beams for inertial fusion applications @xcite , collisionless shocks and collision of flowing plasmas in astrophysics @xcite , generation of suprathermal electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such beams are common in laboratory plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> electrons emitted by electrodes surrounding or immersed in the plasma are accelerated by the sheath electric field and become the electron beams penetrating the plasma . in plasma applications where controlling the electron velocity distribution function ( evdf ) is crucial @xcite , these beams are an important factor capable of modifying the evdf and affecting the discharge properties .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , xu _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite and chen and funk @xcite reported an evdf measured in a dc - rf discharge with 800 v dc voltage which has not only a peak at 800 ev corresponding to the electrons emitted from the dc - biased electrode , but also a significant fraction of accelerated electrons with energy up to several hundreds ev . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the acceleration is explained invoking nonlinear wave - particle interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested that the 800 ev beam excites fast long plasma waves which decay parametrically into ion acoustic waves and short plasma waves with much lower phase velocity , then the short waves accelerate slow electrons of the low - temperature plasma bulk . </S>",
    "<S> a similar mechanism may explain enhanced energetic tails in the energy spectrum of electrons in aurora @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other mechanisms invoked to explain the evdf structure include phase - bunching , kinematic effect of electrons being trapped between rf and dc potentials and released towards the rf electrode during short period of time when rf voltage is small compared to the dc voltage @xcite .    in order to further understand the mechanism of acceleration in the experiment of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a beam - plasma system was simulated using a 1d3v particle - in - cell code edipic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the edipic was extensively benchmarked against available analytical predictions for two stream instability in linear and nonlinear regimes . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results discussed below show that the acceleration may be caused not only by the nonlinear effects , but by the effects related to the plasma nonuniformity as well . note that profiling the background plasma density is a method to control the beam energy deposition in plasma @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one can excite the instability and achieve beam energy deposition in desirable regions while suppressing the instability in undesirable regions by employing convective stabilization effects @xcite . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite an experimental study and particle - in - cell simulations of interaction of a strong , warm electron beam with an inhomogeneous , bounded plasma showed that the trapped langmuir waves can determine the frequencies and areas of localization of the wave field . in those studies the beam energy was relatively low ( 40 ev ) and the acceleration of plasma electrons was not observed .    </S>",
    "<S> the present paper discusses the mechanism of generation of suprathermal electrons found in the simulation . in this process </S>",
    "<S> , the beam excites long plasma waves in the plasma body , the long plasma waves are converted into short plasma waves at the plasma periphery where the plasma density decreases , and the short waves accelerate bulk electrons . </S>",
    "<S> some of these electrons return into the acceleration area again due to reflections from the sheath regions near the plasma boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the second interaction with the short plasma waves yields electrons with anomalously high energies . repeating the acceleration for the same particle is more efficient than a one - time interaction between particles and plasma waves in density gradient areas considered _ </S>",

    "<S> electrons are generated by short plasma waves excited at the density gradients . </S>",
    "<S> some of the accelerated electrons may be reflected by the anode sheath and reintroduced into the two - stream instability area where they will be accelerated one more time . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of an electron after the second acceleration can be an order of magnitude higher than its initial energy and few times more than its energy after the first acceleration stage . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation above , unlike the experiments of @xcite , does not include the rf voltage . </S>",
    "<S> this has both favorable and negative consequences . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , variation of the energy of the beam by the rf voltage may reduce the efficiency of excitation of plasma waves . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in a real dc - rf system , plasma bulk electrons are trapped ( at least part of the rf period ) in a potential well much deeper than the one created by thermal electron motion . </S>",
    "<S> this will prevent suprathermal electrons from escaping to the walls and allow them to go through two or more acceleration cycles as described above . </S>"
