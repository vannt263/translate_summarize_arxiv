    "since the nuclear interaction is very similar to the van der waals potential between molecules , the possible existence of liquid - gas(l - g ) phase transition in nuclear matter was predicated by theoretical studies@xcite .",
    "this predication was supported later by intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions@xcite and high - energy proton - induced reactions@xcite .",
    "the idea of an l - g phase transition in nuclear matter emerged and attracted much interest@xcite .",
    "this interest has increased in the last decade , with the attempts by the eos collaboration to extract exponents of 1 gev / nucleon au nuclei with a carbon target@xcite and with the extraction by the aladin / land collaboration of a caloric curve resulting from the fragmentation of the quasiprojectile formed in the collision au+au at 600 mev / nucleon exhibiting a behavior expected for a first - order l - g phase transition@xcite .",
    "very rich information has already been extracted from exclusive experimental data during the intermediate energy heavy ion collisions , as the new generation @xmath3 detectors have been developed and are now operating at different accelerator facilities , such as dubna , ganil , gsi , lnl , lns , msu and texas a - m@xcite .",
    "this l - g phase transition in nuclear matter occurs at lower density than the normal nuclear density @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the two phases are of cold nuclear fermi liquid on the one hand and a nuclear gas consisting of free nucleons on the other hand . for symmetric nuclear matter , having equal number of protons and neutrons ,",
    "this l - g phase transition is known of first order .",
    "however , mller and serot have indicated that the phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter is of second order by ehrenfest s definition@xcite .",
    "the entropy and the volume as the first order derivatives of the chemical potentials are continuous and the heat capacity as the second order derivative is discontinuous at the point of phase transition .",
    "the phase coexistence surface of this binary system of two phases is two dimensional@xcite .",
    "since the first hypernucleus was detected in emulsion by danysz and pniewski@xcite in 1953 , strangeness carried by s - quark has opened a new dimension for the studies in nuclear physics . with the hyperons included in , nuclear matter",
    "is extended to strange hadronic matter(shm ) . employing different models ,",
    "the equation of state and the stability of the shm have been investigated@xcite .",
    "however , besides the deconfinement phase transition to the quark gluon plasma(qgp ) , whether there exists an l - g phase transition in the shm is still an open question in theoretical physics .",
    "as the interactions between hyperon and nucleon or between hyperons are also of the behavior of the van der waals potential , it is reasonable to guess that there will also be l - g phase transition in the shm .",
    "it is the main purpose to study this problem .",
    "it is believed that the descriptions of nuclear matter and finite nuclei are ultimately governed by the physics of low - energy quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) . because of the nonperturbative properties of qcd , it is very difficult to establish a fundamental theory of nuclear system from qcd .",
    "one usually adopts various phenomenological models based either on hadron degree of freedom or quark degree of freedom . in our previous papers@xcite , we suggested an effective model , constructed by introducing hyperons in the furnstahl - serot - tang(fst ) model@xcite , to study the saturation properties and stabilities of the shm .",
    "the details of this model can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we only give a short description .",
    "in refs.@xcite , we extended the original fst model to include not only nucleons and @xmath5 , @xmath6 mesons , but also @xmath7 , @xmath8 hyperons . a new hyperon - hyperon interaction mediated by two additional strange mesons @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath10 , which couple only to hyperons , is introduced .",
    "the reactions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and their reverses are considered . in this model",
    ", we did not consider the mixture of the @xmath13 hyperons .",
    "the reason , as was explained in ref.@xcite , is twofold .",
    "first , the @xmath13 potential in nuclear matter at the saturation density is rather uncertainly predicted , ranging from completely unbound@xcite to @xmath14@xcite .",
    "as pointed out by balberg et al@xcite , systems involving @xmath13 s together with nucleons or @xmath7 s generally will be unstable with respect to the strong decays @xmath15 or @xmath16 . secondly , the q values for the strong transitions @xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are about @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively@xcite .",
    "to pauli - block these processes , we need a rather high density of @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the q value of @xmath22 is only about @xmath23 .",
    "this process can be pauli - blocked by a relatively low @xmath7 density .",
    "based on this model , the stability , the density , temperature and strangeness fraction dependence of the effective masses of nucleons and baryons , the pressure , the free energy and the equation of state are studied , and the results are reasonable .",
    "the paper evolves from an attempt to study the l - g phase transition of shm by employing the extended fst model . in sec .",
    "ii the extended fst model is laid out .",
    "the shm is modelled into a two - component system ready for the discussion of phase transition .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities for this model are briefly derived out . by analyzing the equilibrium conditions",
    "the phase sections are addressed in sec .",
    "the thermodynamical properties and the phase transition are discussed and the order of the phase transition is also examined .",
    "iv finally summarizes the main results about the existence of the l - g phase transition in the shm .",
    "the original fst model is extended by including @xmath7 and @xmath8 hyperons and two additional strange mesons @xmath24 and @xmath10 to describe the hyperons and the interactions between them as suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "since we are studying the unpolarized system , the @xmath25 meson has no influence on the system and is omitted . to reduce the degrees of freedom , we need some assumptions .",
    "first , we assume @xmath26 and @xmath27 appear in equal amount .",
    "also we have protons and neutrons in equal amount , which is similar to protons and neutrons in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "these assumptions mean that we are looking at matter with zero isospin .",
    "but the remarkable new degree of freedom , strangeness is included .",
    "the lagrangian of the extended fst model is presented as follows : @xmath28\\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{4}s_{\\mu\\nu}s^{\\mu\\nu}+\\frac{1}{2}m_{\\phi } ^{2}\\phi _ { \\mu}\\phi^{\\mu}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_{\\nu}\\sigma^{\\ast } \\partial^{\\nu}\\sigma^{\\ast } -m_{\\sigma ^{\\ast } } ^{2}\\sigma ^{\\ast ^{2}}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in mean - field approximation , the lagrangian can be written as @xmath29\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the meson field operators have been replaced by their mean field values : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "in this section , we employ the extended fst model to investigate the l - g phase transition in the shm at different strangeness fractions . in the calculation , the parameter set t1 given in ref.@xcite is used .    as the hot and dilute shm is only obtained on earth by the relativistic heavy ion collision ,",
    "the investigations of the thermodynamic properties of the shm are based on two basic assumptions .",
    "one is that we can apply equilibrium thermodynamics for such a small system of only few hundred constituents at the most .",
    "the other is that a thermalized uniform system is formed in heavy ion collision before the multi - fragmentation takes place@xcite .",
    "although the equilibrium analysis oversimplifies the study of the shm , we still follow the thermodynamic approach in the reason that this can give some concrete descriptions of the phase structure of the shm and characterize certain aspects of the evolution .",
    "we would like to discuss the stability of shm first . to address the stability , we consider the helmholtz free energy density @xmath78 defined by temperature @xmath79 and baryon densities @xmath80 .",
    "a system is stable against separation into two phases if its free energy is lower than the free energy in all two - phase configurations .",
    "this statement is formulated as @xmath81 with @xmath82 the two phases are denoted by a prime and a double prime . in asymmetric nuclear matter",
    ", we may choose @xmath83 as nuclear density @xmath84 and asymmetry parameter @xmath85 .",
    "the parameter @xmath86 specifies the volume fraction of the phase with double prime .",
    "eq.(18 ) ensures the overall baryon densities are conserved . in the shm here , we may use variables @xmath87 instead of @xmath80 .",
    "the above stability condition implies the following set of inequalities[17 ] @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath68 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are , respectively , the pressure , chemical potentials for nucleon and @xmath8 .",
    "the first inequality eq.(19 ) means that the isothermal compressibility is positive , i.e. the system is mechanically stable .",
    "the second condition eq.(20 ) reflects the special character of the binary system .",
    "it expresses `` diffusive stability '' which guarantees that energy is required to change the concentration in a stable system , while holding the remaining variables ( @xmath68 and @xmath79 ) fixed .",
    "now we begin to discuss the region @xmath92@xcite and show the possibility for an l - g phase transition in the shm .",
    "to be more specific , fig.1 shows the pressure - baryon density isotherms at temperature @xmath0 with different strangeness fractions ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "one can see that there is always a mechanical unstable section where condition ( 19 ) is violated for any strangeness fraction @xmath95 considered .",
    "this means that the system always encounters an unstable region and has to separate into two phases to maintain the mechanical stability .",
    "this phenomenon remains up to @xmath96 . at temperature @xmath2 , as is illustrated in fig.2 , there is a mechanical inflection point which satisfies the condition @xmath97 with @xmath98 and the corresponding pressure @xmath99 , @xmath100 . for @xmath101",
    ", it starts to decrease in high density region and mechanical unstable section will occur .",
    "however , one can not find the solution which satisfies the gibbs conditions in this region ( see below in fig.7 ) . to find the temperature dependence of @xmath102",
    ", we also show the situation for @xmath103 in fig.3 .",
    "the mechanical inflection point is around @xmath104 and @xmath105 on the isotherm with @xmath106 for @xmath103 .",
    "we find the @xmath107 decreases when the temperature increases . in fig.4 , we present the pressure - density isotherms of fixed strangeness fraction @xmath108 at different temperatures .",
    "one can see again an inflection point on the curve with @xmath2 .",
    "next , we will discuss the chemical instability by showing the chemical potential isobars for nucleons and @xmath8 against strangeness fractions @xmath95 at temperature @xmath109 for pressure @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , in fig.5 .",
    "there is an inflection point on the curve with pressure @xmath112 .",
    "this pressure is called critical pressure@xcite , above which the system is stable but below which condition ( 20 ) is violated and the system becomes chemical unstable .",
    "the critical pressure @xmath113 is determined by the inflection point condition : @xmath114 the result @xmath115 defines a critical point for a given temperature @xmath109 .",
    "when the system separates into two phases , the two coexistent phases are governed by the gibbs conditions , which say that for two phases ( or more ) the system should be in chemical , thermal and mechanical equilibrium .",
    "@xmath116 @xmath117 where the superscripts @xmath118 , @xmath119 denote the liquid and gas phases , respectively .",
    "here we only consider the situation of two - phase case . as to more than two phases",
    ", there is some discussion in ref.@xcite .",
    "the solution @xmath120 specifying the two separate phases in equilibrium can be easily found through a geometric approach . as an example",
    ", we present in fig.6 the chemical - strangeness fraction isotherms at temperature @xmath121 and pressure @xmath122 .",
    "the desired solutions form the edges of a rectangle shown by dotted lines .",
    "the phase with lower(higher ) @xmath95 corresponding to a higher(lower ) density is liquid(gas ) phase .",
    "it is obvious that the strangeness fractions are different in the two phases .",
    "the collection of all such pairs ( @xmath123 ) and ( @xmath124 ) forms a binodal surface of two dimensions , which defines the phase separation boundary .",
    "the shape of the whole binodal surface is similar to that in ref.@xcite . to explain clearly we show in fig.7 a section of the binodal surface at @xmath2 . in fig.7",
    "the binodal curve is divided into two branches by zero strangeness point and critical pressure(cp ) point .",
    "the branch for larger @xmath125 represents the gas phase with lower density and the other for the liquid phase with higher density . in an isothermal compression",
    ", a system with zero strangeness evolves until it encounters the binodal and then remains there until the transition is completed . in an isothermal compression with @xmath126 ,",
    "the l - g phase transition can not take place because the isothermal line does not cross the binodal surface .",
    "at cp point , the liquid branch and gas branch joint together smoothly and then the two phases can no longer be distinguished by their densities .",
    "the cp point determines the maximum pressure in two - phase region .",
    "if the system is represented by the point in the section lower than the gas phase branch , the system is in the gas phase , whereas if the system is at the point higher than the liquid phase branch , it is in the liquid phase . between the two branches ,",
    "the system is in the mixed phase with a special proportion between liquid and gas phases .",
    "the feature of the binodal curve at temperature @xmath127 is very similar to those in asymmetric nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "but for the temperature lower than @xmath128 , the critical points could not be attained .",
    "instead , we can always find a limit pressure in the binodal surface . as an example , we show in fig.8 the section of the binodal surface at the temperature @xmath129 , where a limit pressure @xmath130 is denoted by a horizontal dotted line .",
    "when pressure is higher than the limit pressure @xmath131 , the l - g phase transition can not take place .",
    "the cut - off behavior for the binodal surface has also been found in asymmetric nuclear matter described by fst model with density - dependent @xmath132 coupling @xmath133@xcite .",
    "if @xmath133 is constant , the cut - off behavior will not happen so that a critical point could always be found and no limit pressure is obtained . in this case , the l - g phase transition becomes more complicated .",
    "the limit pressure exists when @xmath134 even all couplings are constant .",
    "the maxwell construction of the phase transition can narrate a phase transition clearly and give a concrete proof for the existence of the l - g phase transition .",
    "for a given temperature , we will expatiate the behavior of shm under isothermal compression . at @xmath135 , for instance , fig.8 illustrates the situation of the isothermal compression .",
    "assume that the system is initially in the gas phase with strangeness fraction @xmath136 . during the compression , the phase boundary",
    "is encountered at point a. at this point , the liquid phase is about to emerge at point b , where the strangeness fraction @xmath137 . during the whole compression ,",
    "the total strangeness fraction of the system conserves but the strangeness fractions for the liquid and gas phases are changeable .",
    "as the compression proceeds , the gas phase evolves along the gas phase branch of the binodal surface from point a to d , while the liquid phase evolves from b to c along the liquid branch .",
    "when the pressure of the system continues to increase , the system leaves the two - phase region at point c , which has the same strangeness fraction with point a. correspondingly , at point d on the gas branch with strangeness fraction @xmath138 , the gas phase disappears . since the two points a and c are at different branches of the binodal surface",
    ", the shm has undergone an l - g phase transition .    to configure out the evolution of the system between point a and c",
    ", we must solve the following conservation equations @xmath139 @xmath140 for the baryon density , strangeness fractions on the binodal surface and the proportion @xmath141 for given total baryon density @xmath142 and strangeness fraction @xmath95 .",
    "the proportion @xmath141 is @xmath143 at point a and @xmath144 at point c , and it runs through the interval @xmath145 $ ] .",
    "the result is the generalized maxwell construction in the binary system .",
    "the isotherms corresponding to fig.8 are drawn in fig.9 .",
    "the system dose not evolve along the unphysical curve(the dotted line ) .",
    "it follows the nearly strait solid line between point a and c , which is the result of the maxwell construction .",
    "each point on the line corresponds to the stable configuration at each intermediate density during the phase transition .",
    "moreover , if the system is initially in the gas phase with @xmath146 , the process of isothermal compression will make that the system begins at the gas phase , then enters a two phase region and becomes unstable at the limit pressure @xmath131 .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the order of the l - g phase transition in the shm .",
    "by ehrenfest s definition , the first order phase transition is characterized by the discontinuities of the first order derivatives of the chemical potential , such as the discontinuities of entropy and volume , while the second order phase transition unfolds the discontinuous behavior for the second order derivatives of the chemical potential , such as the heat capacity .",
    "using the entropy density of the shm in eq.(16 ) , we have the entropy per baryon as @xmath147 the total entropy per baryon of the system is calculated by the equation : @xmath148 the entropy per baryon as a function of temperature for a matter of @xmath149 during the phase transition at a fixed pressure @xmath150 is delineated in fig.10 .",
    "it is obvious that the entropy per baryon varies continuously during the phase transition . to make our result more transparent",
    ", we calculate the heat capacity @xmath151 of the shm .",
    "@xmath152,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath153   } { t^{4}(e^{\\beta \\left ( e_{i}^{\\ast } ( k)-\\nu _ { i}\\right)}+1)^{3}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath154   } { t^{4}(e^{\\beta \\left ( e_{i}^{\\ast } ( k)+\\nu _ { i}\\right)}+1)^{3}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the heat capacity per baryon is expressed as @xmath155 . in fig.11 .",
    "the specific heat capacity as a function of temperature for a fixed pressure @xmath156 for @xmath149 is presented . a finite discontinuity of the heat capacity",
    "is observed , which demonstrates clearly that the l - g phase transition in shm is of second order .",
    "till now , we can draw out a definite conclusion that an l - g phase transition do exist in the shm and it is of second order .",
    "in this paper we have employed an extended fst model with nucleons and @xmath7 , @xmath8 hyperons to describe the thermodynamical properties of shm . by using the reactions between hyperons and nucleons and making some assumptions ,",
    "we have simplified the shm into a two - component system , which is mathematically feasible to be discussed .",
    "when having set the strangeness fraction to be zero , the model can also obtain results , which match that of symmetric nuclear matter . applying the model ,",
    "we have investigated the l - g phase transition of the shm .",
    "the mechanical unstable region always exists for all strangeness fractions at the temperatures lower than @xmath2 .",
    "meanwhile , chemical instability is also found in chemical potential - strangeness fraction isobars at these temperatures . by using the gibbs conditions of phase equilibrium ,",
    "we have figured out the binodal surface as the phase separation boundary and have found a limit pressure at each temperature , above which there is no l - g phase transition .",
    "the limit pressure gives rise to a cut - off on the section of the binodal surface .",
    "but for temperature as high as @xmath109 , a critical pressure has been obtained in the binodal surface section . at the critical pressure point",
    "the liquid and gas branches joint together , resulting in a closed binodal curve .",
    "the maxwell constructions for the phase transition have been depicted in detail .",
    "the entropy and heat capacity have also been examined and the l - g phase transition in the shm has been determined to be of second order .",

    "<S> moreover , the entropy per baryon and heat capacity per baryon as functions of temperature are examined . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy is continuous during the phase transition but the heat capacity is discontinuous , indicating that the phase transition is of second order . by these efforts , </S>",
