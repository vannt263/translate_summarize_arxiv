    "nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) color centers in diamond have become platforms for quantum information processing because the spin of the nv can be manipulated  @xcite and is easy to initialize to the ground state level , even at room temperatures  @xcite .",
    "nvs have a long relaxation time at room ( and lower ) temperatures , hence single spin control can be achieved over long time scales  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the quantum state of nvs can be optically read out  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gruber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have detected and manipulated an individual nv center . in quantum information and computation applications , controllability of the quantum state in a solid - state medium is very desirable .",
    "entanglement of two nv centers separated by 10 nm was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and entanglement of nvs in two separate diamond samples with a spatial separation of three meters was obtained in ref .",
    "nvs are also good candidates for many technological applications , such as quantum gates  @xcite , quantum cryptography  @xcite , magnetic sensing  @xcite , electric field sensing  @xcite , temperature sensing  @xcite and sensing of inertial effects  @xcite .",
    "maze reported a magnetic sensor and measured 0.5 @xmath0 t magnetic fields with about ten nanometer spatial resolution  @xcite .",
    "because nvs can be used at room temperature , they can be used for magnetic sensing in biological systems .",
    "indeed , the walsworth group visualized a live bacteria with 400 nm spatial resolution  @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of the environment on the system often remains an obstacle to achieving better performance .",
    "environmental effects have been experimentally studied and have been discussed theoretically .",
    "for example , the importance of hyperfine interactions have been studied using electron spin echo modulation spectroscopy  @xcite , raman - heterodyne spectroscopy  @xcite and ramsey fringe spectroscopy  @xcite , and has also been studied theoretically  @xcite . the temperature dependence of relaxation times has been experimentally studied  @xcite , and the effects of phonons has been treated  @xcite . understanding the effects of the environment , i.e. , the effects of other spins , phonons , and other nearby impurities in the crystal lattice , on the electronic and spin degrees of freedom of the nv center is imperative in order to control environmental effects and minimize the adverse effects of noise and decoherence .",
    "the decay dynamics of spin systems is typically characterized by three decay times : ( 1 ) the relaxation time of the population towards equilibrium ; this time scale is denoted as @xmath1 .",
    "( 2 ) the relaxation time of the coherence of a single spin ; this time scale is denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "( 3 ) the relaxation time for the coherence of an ensemble of spins  @xcite .",
    "if each spin is placed in a slightly different environment , the resonance frequency has a width whose inverse corresponds to a decay time called @xmath3 .",
    "hence , even if each spin maintains coherence , the sum of many signals shows what is known as free induction decay .    for a spin 1/2 system",
    ", the dynamics of the spin can be mapped to a three dimensional bloch sphere and the two relevant decay times of a measurement of a single spin are @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "increasing @xmath1 and @xmath2 is important for improving quantum coherence , and therefore vital for quantum information and computing applications .",
    "experimentally , @xmath2 can be measured for an ensemble of spins by removing nonuniform effects using spin echo techniques ; a longitudinal spin relaxation time of @xmath5 s was obtained for nvs at 77 k using dynamical decoupling techniques  @xcite .",
    "but even longer coherence time is hoped for . for a spin 1/2 system",
    ", a three dimensional bloch sphere picture precisely captures the spin physics , and the only decay rates required are @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , an _ ab initio _ study of the electronic structure of nv centers  @xcite reveals that the ground state is a spin _ triplet _ with a zero magnetic field splitting @xmath7 between the @xmath8 level and the @xmath9 levels .",
    "this is confirmed by experiment  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , when transitions between @xmath8 and @xmath10 are selected , typically the dynamics is analyzed in terms of a three dimensional bloch sphere . however , there is always inevitable leakage to the other level through the interaction with the environment .",
    "thus , in general , 9 eigenmodes ( one of which , the steady state mode , always has zero eigenvalue ) are required to fully account for the decoherence of a spin triplet system ( see below ) .    here",
    "we study a single negatively charged diamond nv center , nv@xmath11 , using a simple quantum mechanical model , which allows for analytical solutions , hence , our results yield simple physical insights for understanding relaxation processes in generic three level systems . more specifically",
    ", we consider a three - level system in the presence of fluctuating magnetic fields arising due to its environment and that results in decoherence , dephasing and dissipation .",
    "we calculate the dynamics with and without the presence of a radio frequency field that can strongly couple the triplet levels ( e.g. , @xmath12 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "we show that all 9 eigenmodes of the system are coupled to each other due to interaction of the nv with its environment .",
    "hence , dynamics observed in nv experiments generally result due to combinations of all eigenmodes .",
    "we further fit the evolution of a triplet spin system with a smaller number of decay times ( that are generally somewhat different from the genuine 9 eigenmodes ) and the fits are of excellent quality .",
    "this has practical ramifications regarding fitting experimental data .",
    "we discuss the dynamics the presence of a radio frequency field which strongly couples the @xmath12 and @xmath8 levels , and without such a field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] introduces a model of an nv center in the presence of a fluctuating magnetic field . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wo_strain ] we analyze a case without strain or electric field effects ( @xmath13 , see below ) .",
    "section  [ sec : w_strain ] considers the case with strain . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rf ] we discuss the dynamics in the presence of a radio frequency field that can couple the levels of the nv , and sec .  [ sec : decoherence ] considers coherence relaxation ( transverse spin relaxation ) , i.e. , the decoherence of off - diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] contains a summary and conclusion .",
    "the symmetry group of the nv center is @xmath14 and the ground state of nv@xmath11 is a @xmath15 state , where this state designation refers to an irreducible representation of the @xmath14 group .",
    "the ground state manifold of the nv in the presence of an external magnetic field can be modeled in terms of a spin 1 hamiltonian .",
    "the deterministic part of the hamiltonian ( the part without a stochastic magnetic field ) is given by @xcite @xmath16 where the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , incorporate ligand field effects and the zeeman interaction with the deterministic magnetic field , with the zero magnetic field splitting parameter , @xmath7 ghz , and the magnetic moment of the nv , @xmath21 mhz / g .",
    "for simplicity , we have taken the deterministic magnetic field to be oriented along the @xmath22-axis ( the axis of the nv center ) .",
    "the angular momentum components @xmath23 ( @xmath24 and @xmath22 ) are spin 1 matrices @xcite , and @xmath25 is the complex strain coefficient , which also incorporates the effects of an external electric field ( if present ) @xcite .    an additional time - dependent zeeman spin 1 hamiltonian , @xmath26 , that contains a fluctuating ( stochastic ) magnetic field @xmath27 due to the presence of other magnetic moments that comprise the local environment experienced by the nv can be added to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_nv ] ) .",
    "thus , the full hamiltonian becomes @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the strength of the magnetic field fluctuation and @xmath30 is proportional to the normalized [ see ( [ b_fluc ] ) ] magnetic field fluctuation along the @xmath31th axis at the nv location ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "for the case of gaussian white noise in the magnetic field components , i.e. , @xmath33 the schrdinger equation with the presence of noise should have the following form in order to guarantee the unit normalization of the realization average of the norm @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath35 for gaussian white noise , it is well known that the realization average can be obtained using a master equation with lindblad operators @xmath36 multiplied by lindblad coefficients @xmath37 where @xmath38 are constants .",

    "the eigenvalues of the liouvillian operator in the liouville - von neumann equation for the density matrix of the system determine the dynamics .",
    "each of the matrix elements of the density matrix can be expressed as @xmath47 where the @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are the 9 eigenvalues of the 9@xmath509 liouvillian operator [ henceforth , we call the @xmath48 the generalized eigenmode frequencies @xcite , or eigenmodes for short ] , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are the amplitude coefficients , and the coefficient @xmath53 corresponds to the amplitude of the steady state whose existence is guaranteed by the trace preserving property .",

    "@xmath51 may be zero if the hilbert space is separated due to a special symmetry of the liouvillian .",
    "finally , we remark that , as opposed to our case where the angular momentum operators @xmath23 are chosen to be the lindblad operators , lindblad operators of the form @xmath56 do _ not _ mix off - diagonal elements of the density matrix .",
    "such lindblad operators cause dephasing and transitions between _ diagonal _ elements  @xcite .",
    "these two cases are quite different .",
    "when @xmath56 is used as a lindblad operator , it causes the population dynamics of diagonal elements from @xmath57 to @xmath58 as well as the dephasing of four density matrix elements ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 and their conjugates , where @xmath61 is an index that is not equal to @xmath62 nor @xmath63 ) without mixing the density matirx elements .",
    "choosing angular momentum operators , e.g. , @xmath64 , as lindblad operators results in very different behavior than choosing the four transition operators @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 as lindblad operators . for example ,",
    "the first term of the lindblad dissipator associated with an angular momentum @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath70 , can be written as @xmath71 whereas the first term of the lindblad dissipator associated with the four transition operators contains only four terms : @xmath72 terms such as @xmath73 appear only if angular momentum is chosen as a lindblad operator .",
    "this kind of term mixes the diagonal elements and the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix . on the other hand ,",
    "terms which appear in both cases only affect populations ( the diagonal elements of the density matrix ) , i.e. , the term @xmath74 increases the population of state @xmath31 , @xmath75 .",
    "linblad operators involving transition operators yield population rate equations ( @xmath76 , whereas linblad operators involving angular momentum operators yield master equations with two sets of closed equations ; one set for the diagonal elements that are coupled to @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and one set for the other off - diagonal matrix elements , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "note that @xmath81 terms yield the decay of off - diagonal elements density matrix elements @xmath82 as well as the diagonal density matrix element @xmath83 .    to summarize , the angular momentum lindblad operators model decoherence and dissipation due to random magnetic fields arising from the presence of magnetic impurities that make up a noisy paramagnetic bath .",
    "the lindblad operators corresponding to transition operators can be used to model the asymmetric transition between two levels and are typically used to obtain local detailed balance of two - levels system .    before starting our detailed analysis ,",
    "let us comment on the relation between the bound on coherence times and the lindblad equation for two - level systems . from experiments that measure @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ", it is well known that the coherence time @xmath2 is bound by twice the population decay time , @xmath84 , for two - level systems .",
    "this relation is closely related to the lindblad equation ; the relation @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the real part of the @xmath31th eigenmode , was proved for any lindbladian time evolution  @xcite .",
    "eigenmodes of two - level systems are either three real values or have one real and a pair of complex conjugate values .",
    "the later is observed in most systems because the hamiltonian yields the imaginary parts .",
    "taking @xmath87 casts the inequality into the form @xmath88 .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the extension of this relation to @xmath89-level systems is still an open question , but we expect that a similar inequality may hold for @xmath89-level systems .",
    "we note that a stronger limit was reported for nvs , i.e. , @xmath2 is limited to approximately @xmath90 over a wide range of temperatures  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we study a case without strain and without the presence of an external electric field , i.e. , @xmath13 . in this case",
    ", we observe    * the density matrix elements @xmath91 and @xmath92 do not couple to their conjugates , i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath80 .",
    "thus , one only needs to solve 2@xmath502 matrix problem rather than 4@xmath504 , which is the special property for non - strain case @xmath13 . *",
    "diagonal elements are decoupled from the off - diagonal elements  @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "therefore one can model the relaxation rate of the diagonal elements and that of the off - diagonal elements independently since they decoupled in this case .",
    "however , as we shall show below , this is not the case if strain or a rf field is present .",

    "additional information about nv centers can be gleaned from experiments in the presence of a radio frequency field tuned to frequencies close to resonance with a ground state transition , e.g. , the @xmath170 transition .",

    "we discussed the dynamics of nv centers in diamond in the presence of a fluctuating magnetic field that arises from the surroundings ( the environment ) with and without the presence of a rf field that couples levels of the ground electronic state manifold .",
    "the nv ground state is a triplet , hence three levels play a role in the dynamics and we studied its decoherence and dephasing . when neither strain nor a rf field are included in the description , the relaxation rate of the diagonal elements of density matrix towards a boltzmann distribution and the relaxation of the off - diagonal elements ( loss of quantum coherence ) are easy to obtain analytically . with strain and without rf field ,",
    "@xmath178 does not couple to the other element and the dynamics is the same as the non - strain case . the dominant modes for @xmath177 , @xmath185 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 are affected by strain .",
    "surprisingly , we were able to analytically prove that even though @xmath91 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 couple each other , the dominant modes for them have exactly the same relaxation rate as the non - strain case ; strain only modifies the frequencies of their oscillation ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : w_strain ] ) .",
    "when a rf field between @xmath8 and @xmath12 is present , all the modes appear in the dynamics of each of the density matrix elements , therefore , the conventional two - level system analysis for nvs can be very misleading . depending on the parameters used , we observe that the relaxation times obtained by the fit can be slightly different from those of the eigenmodes . hence , in order to understand the relaxation processes induced by a complicated environment and obtain accurate determination of relaxation times , one should use all the eigenmodes .    before closing , let us comment on the decay dynamics at finite temperature .",
    "there are several ways that temperature can affect the nv system .",
    "the strain parameter @xmath231 depends on the crystal phonons ( and the electric field at the location of the nv ) , hence the phonon temperature affects of strain .",
    "also , the vibrational dynamics of the spins that produce the fluctuating magnetic field at the location of the nv affect the dipole - dipole interactions of the nv dipole moment and the other dipole moments in the crystal , hence the fluctuating field is affected by the phonons because they modify the relative coordinate vectors from the nv to the other dipole moments ( these coordinate vectors appear in the dipole - dipole interaction ) .",
    "the equilibrium state of the nv should also be temperature dependent ( it should be a boltzmann equilibrium state that depends on the temperature ) .",
    "but , except at extremely low temperature , the boltzmann factor in diamond nvs , @xmath232 , where @xmath233 is the boltzmann constant , is almost unity ; therefore , any temperature dependence of the equilibrium would be practically impossible to observe .",
    "but for extremely low temperature , a departure of the equilibrium density matrix from the democratic state ( the state with equal population in all levels ) might be observable .",
    "temperature dependence is not explicitly built into our model .",
    "one approach to include the effects of temperature is to derive a reduced density matrix equation from a microscopic model .",
    "to do so for nv centers , requires incorporation of the effects of phonons and spin baths . after tracing out the spin bath and phonon degrees of freedom",
    ", one would obtain a master equation for the reduced density matrix .",
    "however , this approach requires detailed knowledge for the interactions and the spectral density function of the baths  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can consider less precise but phenomenological approaches to treat temperature effects .",
    "one of the simplest approaches would be to add transition operators as lindblad operators and artificially force the system to equilibrium at a given temperature by using asymmetric lindblad coefficients .",
    "for example , consider 6 transition operators between any two of the three levels of the nv ground state system .",
    "if @xmath13 , one can choose an arbitrary value for 4 of the 6 lindblad coefficients ( note that the 4 coefficients could be zero ) , and the choice of the 4 coefficients determines the other two coefficients ( the other two lindblad coefficients can not be the pair @xmath234 and @xmath235 ) .",
    "for example , for the symmetric fluctuation case , @xmath236 , the other two lindblad coefficients are obtained in the following manner .",
    "suppose we have lidnblad coefficients @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 from experiment , where @xmath241 is the lindblad coefficient for the lindblad operator @xmath242 .",
    "then , the remaining two coefficients are given by @xmath243 where @xmath244 denotes a population of boltzmann distribution at a given temperature for @xmath245 .",
    "although one still would need relaxation rates from experiment in order to determine the lindblad coefficients , this approach is much simpler than determining the interaction and the spectral density functions of the baths .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath246 , one can choose arbitrary values for 3 of the 6 lindblad coefficients , and the other 3 are completely specified . in general , by adding coupling operators , one has less freedom to choose lindblad coefficients",
