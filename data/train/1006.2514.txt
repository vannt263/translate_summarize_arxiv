    "cosmic strings ( see @xcite for initial work on cosmic strings and structure formation ) can not be @xcite the dominant source of the primordial fluctuations , however they can still provide a secondary source of fluctuations . over the past decade , the realization has grown that many inflationary scenarios constructed in the context of supergravity models lead to the formation of gauge theory cosmic strings at the end of the inflationary phase @xcite . also , in a large class of brane inflation models the formation of cosmic superstrings @xcite at the end of inflation is generic @xcite , and in some cases ( see @xcite ) these strings are stable ( see also @xcite for reviews on fundamental cosmic strings ) .",
    "cosmic superstrings are also a possible remnant of an early hagedorn phase of string gas cosmology @xcite . in all of these contexts , both a scale - invariant spectrum of adiabatic coherent perturbations and a sub - dominant contribution of cosmic strings is predicted .",
    "hence , it is important to search for the existence of cosmic strings .    in this paper",
    "we study the signature of cosmic strings in 21 cm radiation maps ( see e.g. @xcite for an in - depth review of 21 cm cosmology ) .",
    "observing the intensity of the cosmological background radiation at wavelengths corresponding to the red - shifted 21 cm transition line of neutral hydrogen has several potential advantages compared to the currently explored windows .",
    "first of all , it probes the distribution of the dominant form of baryonic matter and is thus not sensitive to our incomplete understanding of star formation and non - linear evolution , which is a problem when interpreting the results of optical redshift surveys .",
    "secondly , it probes the universe at higher redshifts and allows us to explore the  dark ages \" ( the epoch before star formation and non - linear clustering set in ) . related to this",
    ", it explores the distribution of matter in a regime when the amplitude of the fluctuations is smaller and linear theory is a better approximation .",
    "finally , 21 cm surveys provide three - dimensional maps , a significant potential advantage over cmb anisotropy maps .",
    "cosmic strings are known to give rise to distinctive signatures in cmb temperature anisotropy maps @xcite , cmb polarization maps @xcite and large - scale structure ( lss ) maps @xcite .",
    "these distinctive signatures come from moving long ( compared to the hubble radius ) strings ( see section 2 ) . in the cmb temperature maps ,",
    "these strings lead to line discontinuities , in the polarization maps to ( roughly ) rectangular regions with extra polarization , and in lss maps to thin planar regions of enhanced density .",
    "these signals are manifest in position space maps , but they become obscured when calculating power spectra . hence , the lesson is to study the maps in position versus momentum space .    here , we compute the signature of a single cosmic string wake in 21 cm emission .",
    "we find that strings with tensions @xmath2 somewhat below the current limits of @xmath4 could be detected in 21 cm maps where they would appear as wedges in 21 cm maps with either extra emission or extra absorption , depending on the tension and on the specific redshift .",
    "the planar dimensions are set by the direction of the string and its velocity vector , and the width of the wedges is proportional to the string tension .",
    "this signal must be searched for in position space maps . in fourier space",
    "the distinctive phase information would be washed out .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we discuss how string wakes are generated and how these lead to distinctive signals for observations .",
    "we review gravitational accretion of matter onto cosmic string wakes and compute the temperature of the hi gas inside the wake . in section 3",
    "we then study the 21 cm emission signal from a single cosmic string wake .",
    "the generalization to the case of a network of string wakes will be addressed in a future publication .",
    "we compute the brightness temperature and describe the geometrical structure of the signal , a structure very characteristic for cosmic strings . in the final section",
    "we summarize our results and put them in the context of other work on the possible detection of cosmic strings . when computing the magnitude of the 21 cm signal , we use the same wmap concordance values @xcite for the cosmological parameters as used in the review @xcite .",
    "in many field theory models , the formation of a network of cosmic strings is an inevitable consequence of a phase transition in the early universe ( for reviews on cosmic strings see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this network of cosmic strings approaches a  scaling solution \" which means that the statistical properties of the string network are the same at all times if distances are scaled to the hubble radius @xcite .",
    "the detailed form of the scaling solution must be obtained from numerical simulations @xcite of the evolution of a network of cosmic strings ( see also @xcite for some recent analytical work ) .",
    "there are two components of the string network - firstly a network of  long \" strings with a mean curvature radius @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a constant of order unity , and secondly a distribution of string loops with radii smaller than the horizon which results from the  cutting up \" of the long string network as a consequence of string intersections . according to more recent cosmic string evolution simulations ,",
    "the long string component is more important for cosmological structure formation .",
    "numerical simulations by different groups have clearly verified the scaling solution for the long string network .",
    "there is , however , still a large uncertainty concerning the distribution of string loops ( the only agreement seems to be that the loops are less important than the long strings for cosmological structure formation ) .",
    "hence , in order to obtain constraints in models with cosmic strings which are robust against the uncertainties in the numerical simulations , it is important to focus on signatures of long strings as opposed to signatures of string loops .",
    "the tightest current constraints on cosmic strings come from the shape of the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies , yielding a constraint of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) [ limit ] g < 3 10 ^ -7 , where @xmath2 is the string tension and @xmath7 is newton s constant . however , it is important to keep in mind that this limit is based on an analytical description of the scaling solution which contains a number of parameters which can only be determined from comparisons with numerical simulations and whose values thus have a substantial uncertainty .",
    "work based on a field theory simulation of strings @xcite gives a limit of twice the above value ( see also @xcite for a very recent analysis of the different bounds ) . note that limits on the cosmic string tension which come from gravitational radiation from string loops @xcite are sensitive both to the large uncertainties in the distribution of string loops , and also to back - reaction effects on cosmic string loops ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and are hence not robust .",
    "direct limits on the cosmic string tension @xmath2 can be obtained by looking for specific signatures of individual long strings .",
    "these are limits which are insensitive to the parameters in the cosmic string scaling solution .",
    "limits obtained from searching for the kaiser - stebbins signature of a long string in cmb temperature maps were derived in @xcite using wmap data .",
    "the limits obtained were weaker than the ones from ( [ limit ] ) .",
    "however , the angular scale of the wmap experiment is too large to be able to effectively search for sharp features in position space maps such as those predicted by cosmic strings .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that the string signatures for values of @xmath8 somewhat smaller than the limiting value of ( [ limit ] ) should be clearly visible in smaller angular scale cmb anisotropy maps such as those provided by the act @xcite and spt @xcite experiments . in recent work",
    "@xcite it was shown that limits up to an order of magnitude tighter than ( [ limit ] ) might be achievable using spt data . in the following ,",
    "we will discuss direct signals of wakes created by long strings in 21 cm surveys .",
    "as first pointed out in @xcite and then further discussed in @xcite , long strings moving perpendicular to the tangent vector along the string give rise to  wakes \" behind the string , i.e. in the plane spanned by the tangent vector to the string and the velocity vector .",
    "the wake arises as a consequence of the geometry of space behind a long straight string @xcite - space perpendicular to the string is conical with a deficit angle given by [ deficit ] = 8 g . from the point of view of an observer behind the string ( relative to the string velocity vector )",
    ", it appears that matter streaming by the string ( from the point of view of the observer traveling with the string ) obtains a velocity kick of magnitude v = 4 g v_s _ s ~ 4 km / s ( g ) _ 6 v_s _ s towards the plane behind the string . in the above , @xmath9 is the velocity of the string ( in units of the speed of light ) , @xmath10 is the corresponding relativistic gamma factor , and @xmath11 is the value of @xmath8 in units of @xmath12 .",
    "this leads to a wedge - shaped region behind the string with twice the background density ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "since the strings are relativistic , they generally move with a velocity of the order of the speed of light .",
    "there will be frequent intersections of strings .",
    "the long strings will chop off loops , and this leads to the conclusion that the string distribution will be statistically independent on time scales larger than the hubble radius . hence , to model the effects of strings we will make use of a toy model introduced in @xcite and used in most analytical work on cosmic strings and structure formation since then : we divide the time interval between the time of equal matter and radiation and the current time @xmath13 into hubble expansion time steps . in each time step",
    ", we lay down a distribution of straight string segments moving in randomly chosen directions with velocities chosen at random between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( in units of the speed of light ) . the centers and directions of these string segments",
    "are also chosen randomly , and the string density corresponds to @xmath16 strings per hubble volume , where @xmath16 is an integer which is of the order @xmath15 according to the scaling of the string network .",
    "the distribution of string segments is uncorrelated at different hubble times .",
    "each string segment will generate a wake , and it is the signal of one of these wakes which we will study in the following .    a string segment laid down at time @xmath17 will generate a wake whose dimensions at that time are the following : [ size ] c_1",
    "t_i t_i v_s _ s 4 g t_i v_s _ s , where @xmath6 is a constant of order one . in the above , the first dimension is the length in direction of the string , the second is the depth . the fact that the string wake has a finite depth is due to the causality constraints on density fluctuations produced during a phase transition @xcite : the information about the formation of a string ( and hence the information about the existence of a deficit angle ) can not have propagated farther than the horizon from the point of nucleation of the defect .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the deficit angle quite rapidly tends to zero as the horizon is approached .",
    "the overdense region in the wake will lead to the gravitational accretion of matter above and below the wake towards the center of the wake . in this way",
    ", the wake will grow in thickness .",
    "the accretion of matter onto a cosmic string wake was studied in @xcite in the case of the dark matter being cold , and in @xcite in the case of the dark matter being hot .",
    "we are interested in the case of cold dark matter . as an aside",
    ", we mention that if the strings have lots of small - scale structure then they will have an effective tension which is less than the effective energy density @xcite .",
    "this will lead to a local gravitational attraction of matter towards the string , a smaller transverse velocity , and hence to string filaments instead of wakes .",
    "the gravitational accretion onto string filaments was studied in @xcite .",
    "we will now review the computation of the width of the wake .",
    "we are interested in the distribution of baryons in the vicinity of the string . however , for @xmath18 the baryons and cold dark matter feel the same gravitational attraction and will thus behave in the same way - modulo thermal velocity effects which will be discussed later - until the baryons undergo a shock .",
    "thus , for the moment we focus on the onset of clustering of the cold dark matter .",
    "we are interested in wakes created after the time @xmath19 of equal matter and radiation ( there is no gravitational clustering of cold dark matter before that time ) . for times between @xmath19 and recombination ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "the baryons are coupled to the radiation . however , for @xmath18 the baryons will rapidly fall into the potential wells created by the cold dark matter and thus , once again , it is legitimate to focus attention on the clustering of the cold dark matter .",
    "note that wakes produced at the earliest time are the most numerous .",
    "we consider a mass shell located at a comoving distance @xmath21 above the wake .",
    "its physical distance above the wake at time @xmath22 is [ height1 ] w(q , t ) = a(t ) ( q - ) , where @xmath23 is the co - moving perturbation induced by gravitational accretion .",
    "if the wake is laid down at the initial time @xmath17 ( with corresponding redshift @xmath24 ) , then the initial conditions for the cold dark matter fluctuation are [ ic ] ( t_i ) = ( t_i ) = 0 . as a consequence of the initial wake planar overdensity @xmath25 , the co - moving displacement @xmath23 will begin to increase .",
    "the clustering dynamics can be studied making use of the zeldovich approximation @xcite in which the gravitational force is treated in the newtonian limit .",
    "as reviewed recently in @xcite , we obtain [ height2 ] ( t ) = ( t_i ) ( ) ^2/3 ( ) ^2/3 t_0 ^ 2 , where @xmath13 is the present time and @xmath25 is the initial wake planar density excess .    the mass shell with initial comoving distance @xmath21 above the wake  turns around \" when @xmath26 . at time @xmath22",
    ", this occurs for a value @xmath27 given by [ qnl ] q_nl(t ) = g v_s _ s ( z_i + 1)^-1/2 t_0 ( ) ^2/3 .",
    "it is easy to check that at the point of turnaround ( q_nl , t ) = q , and that hence the density inside the turnaround surface is twice the background density .",
    "once a matter shell reaches its maximal distance @xmath28 from the center of the wake , it will start to collapse onto the wake .",
    "the infall of matter will halt as the shell hits other streams of matter .",
    "this will lead to a shock . in analogy with what can be shown analytically in the context of the spherical collapse model ( see e.g. @xcite ) we assume that the shock occurs at approximately half the maximal distance .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite confirm the applicability of this assumption .",
    "since the distance at turnaround is half the width the shell would have without gravitational accretion onto the wake , the shock occurs at a distance @xmath29 of that which the matter shell would have under unperturbed hubble expansion .",
    "hence , the average density inside the wake is four times the background density , a result which will be used several times in the computations of the following section .",
    "the evolution of the mass shell between turnaround and shock can be followed using ( [ height1 ] ) and ( [ height2 ] ) .",
    "the shock will occur when @xmath30 .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that at this point the velocity is given by [ hresult ] ( q , t ) = - g v_s _ s ( ) ^1/2 .",
    "it is this velocity which then determines the temperature inside the shocked region",
    ".    the shocks will lead to thermalization of the wake",
    ". the gas temperature will be given by [ temp ] k_b t = m v^2 , where @xmath31 is the mass of a hi atom and @xmath32 is the velocity of the in - falling particles when they hit the shock , which is given by [ vel ] v = w(q(t ) , t ) , where @xmath33 is the comoving distance of the shell which starts to collapse at the time @xmath22 .",
    "inserting the result ( [ hresult ] ) into ( [ vel ] ) and then into ( [ temp ] ) we obtain the following result for the temperature @xmath34 of the hi atoms inside the wake [ waket ] t_k & = & ( g ) ^2 ( v_s _ s)^2 k_b^-1 m + & & [ 20  k ] ( g ) _ 6 ^ 2 ( v_s _ s)^2 , where in the second line we have written the result in degrees k and expressed @xmath8 in units of @xmath12 ( and kept only one significant figure in reporting the final number ) .",
    "the wake temperature is largest for wakes produced at the earliest times since the initial wake density is then the highest , and increases as time increases because more matter has time to accrete .    assuming values of @xmath4 ( the current upper bound on the string tension ) , @xmath35 , ( close to the time of recombination ) , @xmath0 and @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( [ waket ] ) yields @xmath37 .",
    "this temperature is smaller than the cmb temperature @xmath38 at this redshift . as we will see in the following section , this leads to an absorption signal in the 21 cm radiation .",
    "the formation of a cosmic string wake and the thermalization which takes place inside the shocked region has been studied in @xcite using an eulerian hydro code @xcite optimized to resolve shocks .",
    "the numerical simulations of @xcite show that the density and temperature inside the shocked region are indeed roughly uniform and that the temperature obtained agrees with the values obtained here using analytical approximations .    looking for signals from cosmic strings in 21 cm surveys",
    "is potentially more powerful than looking in large - scale optical redshift surveys .",
    "this is because firstly the non - gaussian signatures from strings are more pronounced at higher redshifts , secondly because we are directly looking at the distribution of the baryons , and not just the distribution of stars , the latter being affected by non - linear and gas dynamics , and thirdly because the distribution of matter is more linear at higher redshifts and hence easier to follow analytically .",
    "compared to cmb and cmb polarization maps , 21 cm surveys have the advantage of yielding three- rather than just two - dimensional maps , maps thus containing much more information . to our knowledge , there has been little previous work on 21 cm emission from strings .",
    "two exceptions are @xcite in which the angular power spectrum of 21 cm emission from a network of cosmic strings was considered , and @xcite , a recent study in which the correlation between 21 cm emission and cmb signals from cosmic strings was studied .",
    "in contrast to these works , we are looking for direct string signals in position space 21 cm maps .    in the following section we will briefly summarize some key features of 21 cm cosmology and apply the equations for the 21 cm brightness temperature to the case of emission from a string wake .",
    "neutral hydrogen is the dominant form of baryonic matter in the  dark ages \" , i.e. before star formation .",
    "neutral hydogen has a 21 cm hyperfine transition line which is excited if the hydrogen gas is at finite temperature .",
    "hence , we expect redshifted 21 cm radiation to reach us from all directions in the sky , and the intensity of this radiation can tell us about the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the universe , as a function of both angular coordinates in the sky and redshift .",
    "thus , in contrast to the cmb , 21 cm surveys can probe the three - dimensional distribution of matter in the universe ( see @xcite for pioneering papers on the cosmology of the 21 cm line and @xcite for an in - depth review ) .",
    "let us now consider the equation of radiative transfer along the line of sight through a hydrogen gas cloud of uniform temperature- in the case of interest to us this gas cloud is the cosmic string wake .",
    "the brightness temperature @xmath39 at an observed frequency @xmath40 due to 21 cm emission is given by [ three1 ] t_b ( ) = t_s ( 1 - e^- _ ) + t _ ( ) e^- _ , where @xmath41 is the spin temperature , @xmath42 is the microwave radiation temperature , and @xmath43 is the optical depth obtained by integrating the absorption coefficient along the light ray through the gas cloud .",
    "the frequency @xmath40 is the blue - shifted frequency at the position of the cloud corresponding to the observed frequency @xmath44 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath41 is due to spontaneous emission , while the term proportional to @xmath42 is due to absorption and stimulated emission .    as explained in @xcite , what is of observational interest is the comparison of the temperature coming from the hydrogen cloud with the `` clear view '' of the 21 cm radiation from the cmb .",
    "[ three15 ] t_b ( ) = _ .",
    "note that the `` clear view '' of the cmb is hypothetical since even without a string wake s gas cloud the intergalactic medium is partly a less dense hydrogen gas . in the second part of the equation above we have expanded the exponential factor to linear order in the optical depth .",
    "the spin temperature @xmath41 is defined as the relative number density of atoms in the hyperfine energy states through @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the number densities of atoms in the two hyperfine states , and @xmath48 is the temperature corresponding to the energy splitting @xmath49 between these states .",
    "the spin temperature is determined solely by the temperature @xmath34 of the gas in the wake , as long as uv scattering is negligible ( which is true in our case ) .",
    "the relationship between spin and kinetic gas temperatures is expressed through the collision coefficients @xmath50 which describe the rate of scattering among hydrogen atoms and electrons : [ three2 ] t_s = t _ .",
    "we will shortly discuss the numerical values of the @xmath50 for a particular case of interest .    combining ( [ three15 ] ) and ( [ three2 ] )",
    "we find for the difference @xmath51 in brightness temperature induced by the interaction of the radiation with neutral hydrogen is [ three3 ] t_b ( ) t_s ( 1 - ) _ ( 1 + z)^-1 , where the last factor represents the red - shifting of the temperature between the time of emission and the present time .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the brightness temperature from a region of space without density perturbations is nonzero .",
    "it is negative since the temperature of gas after redshift 200 is lower than that of the cmb photons , the former red - shifting as @xmath52 , the latter as @xmath53 .",

    ", the analysis has been general .",
    "let us now specialize to the case where the gas cloud is the gas inside the cosmic string wake . in this case",
    ", the column density is the hydrogen number density @xmath55 times the length that the light ray traversed in the cloud .",
    "this length will depend on the width @xmath56 of the wake and the angle @xmath57 that the light ray makes relative to the vertical to the wake so that n_hi = .",
    "the factor of @xmath58 results since @xmath56 is the width of the wake from the center .",
    "the line profile @xmath59 is due to broadening of the emission line .",
    "this broadening reflects the fact that not all photons resulting from the hyperfine transition will leave the gas cloud at the same frequency .",
    "frequency differences are in general due to thermal motion , bulk motion and pressure effects . since the pressures we are considering are small by astrophysical standards ,",
    "pressure broadening is negligible .",
    "since the gas temperature inside the wake is not much larger than the cmb temperature , thermal broadening will not be important , either .",
    "this leaves us with the effects of bulk motion , more specifically the expansion of the wake in planar directions .",
    "the line profile is normalized such that the integral of it over frequency is unity .",
    "the origin of the line broadening due to the expansion of the wake is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "let us consider a point on the wake for which the photons travel to us at an angle which is not orthogonal to the plane of the wake .",
    "then , relative to photons emitted at the central point on the photon path , photons emitted from the highest point and the lowest point obtain a relative doppler shift of [ three7 ] = 2 sin ( ) , where @xmath60 is the expansion rate of space and @xmath56 is the wake width computed in the previous section , both evaluated at the redshift @xmath61 when the photons are emitted .",
    "the angle @xmath57 is indicated in figure 2 .",

    "= for [ _ 10 - , _ 10 + ] , and @xmath62 otherwise .",
    "in addition to its role in determining the brightness temperature , the frequency shift @xmath63 is important since it determines the width of the 21 cm signal of strings in the redshift direction and is hence central to the issue of observability of the signal . from ( [ three7 ] ) and ( [ qnl ] ) ( and setting the @xmath64 factor to one ) we find that [ freqwidth ] & = & g v_s _ s ( z_i + 1 ) ^1/2 ( z(t ) + 1 ) ^-1/2 + & & 3 10 ^ -5 ( g ) _ 6 ( v_s _ s ) , where in the second line we have used the cosmological parameters mentioned at the end of the introductory section and inserted the representative redshifts @xmath1 and @xmath65 .     to the vertical to the wake are emitted at different points in the wake .",

    "the 21 cm signal of a cosmic string is an emission signal above the @xmath42 curve and an absorption signal below it . above the @xmath104 curve ,",
    "the temperature of the gas inside the wake is well approximated by the equation ( [ waket ] ) , below it the initial thermal gas temperature effects dominate and the wake temperature will follow the @xmath104 curve .",
    "the wake temperature curves are for a formation redshift of @xmath1 .    , the orange dotted line is @xmath104 , the gas temperature after adiabatic contraction by a factor 4 in volume , and the green ( dot - dashed ) line is the @xmath106 curve .",
    "the two solid curves with positive slope represent @xmath34 for two different values of @xmath8 , @xmath105 in the case of the upper curve and @xmath81 in the case of the lower curve ( in both cases for a formation redshift @xmath1 ) .",
    "following one of the solid curves , we see that the 21 cm string signal is an emission signal above the majenta curve and an absorption signal below it .",
    "the wake temperature is given by @xmath34 only above the orange curve .",
    "for higher redshifts , the initial gas temperature dominates the final temperature of the gas inside the wake , and the latter follows the orange curve .",
    "once @xmath34 drops below the green curve , there will no longer be any shock and our effect disappears.,height=188 ]    the second issue is that the string signal must be compared to what would be seen if the wake region were replaced by unclustered neutral gas . in this case",
    ", the absorption signal has a temperature given by ( [ result2 ] ) with @xmath34 replaced by @xmath106 and the collision coefficient computed with @xmath106 instead of @xmath34 . due to the overdensity of the wake ,",
    "the signal of a string wake should persist .",
    "the overdensity in the string wake by a factor of 4 will lead to an enhancement in the magnitude of the brightness temperature by a factor of 16 compared to what would be seen if the wake region were replaced by unclustered gas .",
    "one factor of 4 comes from the fact that the collision coefficient is proportional to the gas density , the second from the fact that the optical depth is also proportional to the density .",
    "in addition , the temperature ratios in ( [ result2 ] ) are different .    however , for values of @xmath8 so small that @xmath107 there will no longer be any shock and hence no well - defined wake region with overdensity 4 .",
    "this will occur at a value of @xmath8 which is smaller than the limit in ( [ crit2 ] ) by a factor of @xmath108 .",
    "note also that the thickness in redshift space ( discussed below ) of the signal decreases as @xmath8 decreases , and hence improved sensitivity will be required to detect the signal .",
    "the bottom line of the above analysis is that at a redshift of @xmath0 , strings with tensions below the current observational limit are predicted to be visible in absorption in 21 cm surveys .",
    "strings with larger tensions would yield an emission signal . the critical value ( [ crit1 ] ) of @xmath8 at which the emission signal turns into an absorption signal decreases as @xmath61 decreases , so that strings with tensions at the current observational limit would become visible in emission at a redshift of below 20 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath61 can not be smaller than that corresponding to reionization since we have not considered how uv scattering affects the spin temperature .",
    "the 21 cm signature of a cosmic string wake has a distinctive shape in redshift space .",
    "the string signal will be a wedge - like region of extra 21 cm emission .",
    "the signal will be wide in the two angular directions , and narrow in redshift direction .",
    "the projection of this region onto the plane corresponding to the two angles in the sky ( we are working in the limit of small angles and thus can use the flat sky approximation ) corresponds to the projection of the wake onto the observer s past light cone .",
    "the orientation of the wedge in redshift space is given by the orientation of the wake relative to the observer s light cone .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the left panel is a space - time sketch of the geometry ( with two spatial directions suppressed ) .",
    "the wake is created by a string segment which starts out at time @xmath17 at the position @xmath109 and which at time @xmath110 ( roughly one hubble time step later ) has moved to the position @xmath111 ( the arrow on the segment connecting the two events gives the direction of the velocity of the string segment .",
    "for the orientation of the string chosen , the past light cone intersects the `` back '' of the string wake at a later time than the front .",
    "hence , the 21 cm signal has a larger red - shift for photons from the tip of the wake than from the back side of the wake .",
    "the width of the wake vanishes at the tip and increases towards the back .",
    "hence , in redshift space the region of extra 21 cm emission has the orientation sketched on the right panel of figure 4 .",
    "the planar dimensions of the region of extra emission are in the angular directions , and their sizes are the angles corresponding to the comoving area ( see ( [ size ] ) ) c_1 t_i ( z_i + 1 ) t_i v_s _ s ( z_i + 1 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the emission signal depends on the orientation of the wake relative to us ( through the redshift when our past light cone intersects the various parts of the wake ) .",
    "this is not correlated with the direction of string motion .",
    "the width in redshift space , on the other hand , depends on the emission point on the wake - the width is larger in the back and approaches zero at the tip , as given by @xmath63 ( see [ three7 ] ) .",
    "and travels in the direction of the arrow , ending at the position @xmath111 at the time @xmath110 .",
    "the past light cone of the observer at the time @xmath13 intersects the tip of the wake at the time @xmath112 , the back of the wake at time @xmath113 .",
    "these times are in general different .",
    "hence , the 21 cm radiation from different parts of the wake is observed at different red - shifts .",
    "the resulting angle - redshift signal of the string wake shown in the left panel is illustrated in the right panel , where the horizontal axis is the same spatial coordinate as in the left panel , but the vertical axis is the redshift of the 21 cm radiation signal .",
    "the wedge in 21 cm has vanishing thickness at the tip of the wedge , and thickness given by @xmath63 at the back side.,height=177 ]",
    "in this paper we have calculated the 21 cm signal of a single cosmic string wake .",
    "we found that wakes leave a characteristic signal in 21 cm surveys - wedge shaped regions of extra emission or absorption , depending on the value of the string tension .",
    "there is an emission signal as long as the string tension exceeds the critical value given by ( [ crit1 ] ) and as the tension increases the temperature approaches the value given by @xmath114 , a value larger by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the backgrounds from standard cosmology sources which the square kilometer array ( ska ) telescope project is designed to be sensitive to @xcite . for values of @xmath8 below the critical value given by ( [ crit1 ] ) , the cosmic string wake signal changes to an absorption signal .",
    "this will persist down to a value of @xmath8 a factor of @xmath108 smaller than the value given in ( [ crit2 ] ) , at which point the material which is gravitationally attracted to the wake will no longer undergo a shock and hence our analysis ceases to be applicable .",
    "the width of the wedge in redshift space depends on the string tension via ( [ three7 ] ) .",
    "the width increases from zero at the tip of the string to the value given by ( [ three7 ] ) at the midpoint of the wake .",
    "the sensitivity of 21 cm surveys to cosmic strings is best at the lowest redshifts sufficiently higher than the redshift of reionization .",
    "this is due to the fact that the string wakes keep increasing in width as a function of time , leading to an increasing temperature of the gas in the wake and hence to a higher 21 cm signal . at the same time , the wakes become more stable towards thermal disruption .    as mentioned above , the brightness temperature shift which we predict will be large compared to that from the surrounding intergalactic medium .",
    "the fractional frequency width of the signal is given by ( [ freqwidth ] ) and is near the limit of the frequency resolution of radio telescopes for values of @xmath8 close to the current upper bound .",
    "for example , the square kilometer array will have a fractional spectral resolution of the order @xcite of @xmath115 . in both angular directions ,",
    "the signal will cover a rectangle whose side length is given by the comoving hubble radius at the redshift @xmath24 , which for redshifts close to recombination corresponds to a scale of about one degree .",
    "thus , the signal of cosmic strings which we predict is clearly a possible target for future radio telescopes .",
    "for example , the angular resolution of the ska is designed to be smaller than @xmath116 arcsec , and the frequency range of the ska will allow the detection of the 21 cm signal up to a redshift of 20 .",
    "we have focused on the signal of a single wake laid down at a time @xmath117 .",
    "the reader may worry that the signal of such a wake is masked by the `` noise '' due to wakes laid down at earlier times .",
    "even though the baryons will stream out of these wakes due to their coupling with the photons , the dark matter wakes persist . for @xmath118",
    "the dark matter wakes do not grow in thickness until @xmath119 .",
    "after that , the thickness will begin to grow , and at @xmath18 the baryons will start to fall into the dark matter potential wells",
    ". however , the width of such wakes ( averaged over the length of the wake ) is smaller than that of wakes at @xmath119 . in addition",
    ", due to their large number , on length scales of wakes laid down at @xmath120 , the earlier wakes will act like gaussian noise .",
    "the coherent signature in position space of such a `` late '' wake can be picked out of the gaussian noise even if the amplitude of the gaussian noise is comparable to or slightly larger than the amplitude of the signal ( as measured in terms of the contribution to the power spectrum ) .",
    "this has been studied in the context of picking out the signatures of late strings in cmb temperature maps in @xcite , and we expect similar conclusions to hold here .",
    "let us end with a brief comparison of our work with that of @xcite and @xcite who also considered 21 cm signals of cosmic strings .",
    "what sets our work apart is that we focus on the specific position space signature of wakes rather than on the ( fourier space ) power spectrum . in computing a power spectrum",
    ", one loses the information about the non - gaussianities in the distribution of strings .",
    "it is these non - gaussianities which most clearly distinguish the predictions of a string model from a model with only gaussian fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity to the presence of cosmic strings will be much higher in a study like ours compared to what can be achieved by only computing power spectra .",

    "<S> . the signal will have a specific signature in position space : the excess 21 cm radiation will be confined to a wedge - shaped region whose tip corresponds to the position of the string , whose planar dimensions are set by the planar dimensions of the string wake , and whose thickness ( in redshift direction ) depends on the string tension . for wakes created at @xmath1 , then at a redshift of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> the critical value of the string tension @xmath2 is @xmath3 , and it decreases linearly with redshift ( for wakes created at the time of equal matter and radiation , the critical value is a factor of two lower at the same redshift ) . for smaller tensions , cosmic strings </S>",
