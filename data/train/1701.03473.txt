    "further , recent theoretical developments have shown novel possible fundamental physical origins for a change in regime for gravity when reaching the low acceleration region of mond , e.g. the emergent gravity ideas of verlinde ( 2016 ) , or the covariant models including torsion of barrientos & mendoza ( 2016 ) . empirically , durazo et al .",

    "( 2016 ) and desmond ( 2017 ) studying spiral rotation curves , all find the ratio between inferred dark matter content and observed baryonic mass to be consistent with mondian expectations across a wide range of galaxy types and masses .    in light of the above",
    ", it appears reasonable to continue the study of mondian gravity and its predictions . in this paper",
    "we present a novel effect , the expectation of a modified gravity region towards the centre of astrophysical systems , and perform a first exploration of its consequences . under mondian gravity the usual newtonian physics",
    "are recovered in the high acceleration regime , while whenever local acceleration falls below the critical @xmath0 value , the gravitational force shifts towards @xmath2 , for test particles orbiting at a radius @xmath3 from a point mass @xmath4 .",
    "this low acceleration regime typically occurs towards the outskirts of astrophysical systems , where lower matter densities naturally lead to low accelerations .",
    "it becomes clear however , that given the validity of newton s theorems for spherical mass distributions in both newtonian and mondian gravity ( e.g. mendoza et al . 2011 ) , the local acceleration will tend to zero for @xmath5 .",
    "necessarily , this will lead to an inner mondian region on crossing inwards of a threshold radius interior to which @xmath1 , as @xmath6 in going to the actual centre of an astrophysical system .",
    "we present a first development of this effect for constant stellar density cores through a simple analytic development to show the physical scalings and orders of magnitude expected for the size of this inner mondian region , as well as its expected force amplitude , as a function of the density of such a region .",
    "we show that if dynamical tracers within this enhanced gravity region are interpreted under newtonian assumptions , an extra mass component would be inferred , perhaps akin to the intermediate mass black holes reported by some authors ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "2009 , feldmeier et al .",
    "2013 , kamann et al .",
    "2016 ) in the centres of galactic globular clusters , and which have failed to appear under direct searches ( e.g. maccarone & servillat 2010 , lu & kong 2011 and strader et al .",
    "2012 report only upper limits on gc black holes through accretion activity diagnostics ) .",
    "a numerical treatment for cored isothermal stellar distributions , intended merely as accurate phenomenological descriptions of the observed density profiles of globular clusters , is also performed , with parameters representative of galactic globular clusters , in order to explore and give some predictions regarding the gravitational anomaly expected under mondian gravity towards the centres of these systems .",
    "such region should range from somewhat over the inner @xmath7 to less than @xmath8 , in going from systems with central densities spanning from a few tens to a few thousands of @xmath9 .    in section 2",
    "we derive analytically the details of this effect for constant density cores , showing the physical scalings which result . in section 3",
    "we extend the results numerically for cored isothermal stellar profiles , as representative models of the actual stellar density profiles of observed globular clusters . in this section",
    "we also compare with recent studies addressing the controversy of intermediate mass black holes in globular clusters , and give predictions for such an effect in low density globular clusters .",
    "our concluding remarks appear in section 4 .",
    "within a mondian gravity scheme one expects the force felt by a test particle orbiting a total mass @xmath4 to be well described by the newtonian expression of @xmath10 whenever the acceleration is above @xmath11 , and to follow the mondian expression of @xmath12 in the low acceleration regime .",
    "the transition between regimes appears at the point where @xmath13 , yielding a characteristic mond radius @xmath14 e.g. milgrom ( 1984 ) , mendoza et al .",
    "the condition @xmath1 for the modified regime yielding directly @xmath15 , the mondian region appears at distances larger than the characteristic @xmath16 .    given the validity of newton s theorems for spherically symmetric mass distributions also under the mondian regime ( e.g. mendoza et al .",
    "2011 ) , the above expressions can be generalised directly by substituting @xmath17 .",
    "if we now assume a constant density core , as appropriate for a wide range of astrophysical systems , e.g. the central regions of the king halos generally fitted to observed surface brightness profiles of galactic globular clusters , we can take @xmath18 to yield :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the density of the core region in question . as the condition @xmath1 remains @xmath15 , and",
    "as @xmath16 scales with @xmath21 , it is clear that @xmath16 will fall to zero towards the centre at a faster rate than the radial coordinate , yielding necessarily an inner critical radius interior to which a central mondian region is to be expected .",
    "this critical radius , @xmath22 , can be found by equating the radial coordinate to @xmath16 , which gives :    @xmath23    the previous relation in astronomical units reads :    @xmath24    for a constant density core , interior to the above radius dynamics will show a transition towards a mondian regime .",
    "we see that in a globular cluster with a typical central density of @xmath25 only the central @xmath26 will lie within the @xmath1 , @xmath15 inner modified regime . while in going to high density globular clusters , with central densities an order of magnitude higher , the central mondian region will be limited to a tiny @xmath27 region . for low density systems",
    ", the modified regime could easily extend to the central @xmath7 or more .",
    "the development leading to equation ( 1 ) can be repeated for a stellar density profile having a central scaling @xmath28 where the condition for @xmath16 to fall to zero towards @xmath5 faster than the radial coordinate becomes @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we see that for all stellar profiles having a central cusp shallower than @xmath30 , an internal low acceleration @xmath1 region will exist .    in the above",
    "we have ignored the details of any mond transition function and assumed an abrupt shift from the newtonian to the mondian regimes .",
    "such details , in mond as such , are not well constrained beyond the requirement of a fairly abrupt transition e.g. milgrom ( 2014 ) . in hernandez & jimenez ( 2012 )",
    "we showed that under a mondian modelling of galactic globular cluster structure , that when considering mondian force laws at the newtonian level , the transition function is required to be very sudden , as also implied in order to avoid any conflict with solar system dynamics .",
    "as such , any gradual transition function introduced will result in changes to the details of what we develop in this paper , but will not change qualitatively any of the novel results presented .",
    "we can now calculate what extra central mass will be inferred under newtonian dynamics from dynamical tracers within @xmath22 by equating the actual force at a given radius , to the corresponding newtonian expression , to which we add a hypothetically central potential :    @xmath31^{1/2}}{r } = \\frac{g m(r)}{r^{2 } } + \\frac{g m_{bh}}{r^{2}}.\\ ] ]    if we now go to the constant density core of a baryonic mass distribution , e.g. the central regions of galactic globular clusters , @xmath18 and we can solve for @xmath32 from the above expression to yield :    @xmath33\\ ] ]    we see that for large densities and radii the above equation becomes negative , whenever @xmath34 c.f .",
    "equation ( 2 ) , the newtonian term dominates and the equation is not valid , as no mondian regime appears . also , notice that the inferred black hole mass under a newtonian interpretation is",
    "a function of the radial distance at which the tracers being used for the inference are found , i.e. , no consistent , unique inferred black hole mass will appear when treating tracers found over a range of radial distances .",
    "of course , if tracers within the central mondian spike are analysed under a newtonian assumption , some extra mass will necessarily be required , and if one then fits a model with such a black hole mass as a free parameter , statistically , some preferred value will appear .    we can estimate the maximum black hole mass which under a newtonian interpretation could appear as a result of the central mondian region , by setting the radial derivative of the previous equation equal to zero and finding the radius at which a maximum black hole mass appears , @xmath35 given by :    @xmath36    i.e. , slightly inside of the outer edge of the mondian central region one finds the radius at which tracers will , under a newtonian interpretation , require a maximal black hole mass to fit dynamics .",
    "this maximum black hole mass will now be given by :    @xmath37,\\ ] ]    @xmath38    which going to astronomical units yields :    @xmath39    hence , for central globular cluster densities of below @xmath40 , in the range of what is inferred for some well studied galactic globular clusters ( e.g. harris 1996 and updates thereof ) , central black hole masses of more than @xmath41 will be required to understand the dynamics of stellar tracers within a constant density region , under newtonian assumptions . for higher central globular cluster densities ,",
    "the maximum required black hole mass drops as shown above , with the square of the core density .",
    "in the previous section we have given analytic estimates for the effect being presented , under the assumption of a core region of rigorously constant stellar density .",
    "in reality , even within the core region of king halos , as commonly used to describe observed globular clusters , a slight radial drop in density occurs . since we are clearly dealing with an effect",
    "which is very centrally located , and since all king halos tend strongly within their core regions to a cored isothermal solution ( see e.g. fig 4 - 9 in binney & tremaine 1987 ) , we can accurately estimate the effect of the slight curvature in the density profile within the core region of galactic globular clusters , without reference to particular central potential values , by modelling the situation through a cored isothermal stellar density profile , intended solely as an empirical description of the density profile of observed globular clusters .",
    "we begin by calculating cored isothermal profiles , by solving numerically the equation :    @xmath42    under the conditions @xmath43 , @xmath44 at the origin and taking a fixed velocity dispersion of @xmath45 , a value representative of what is observed in galactic globular clusters , e.g. harris ( 1996 ) , scarpa et al .",
    "the central stellar densities of these profiles were chosen to span a range of values bracketing that which is inferred for galactic globular clusters , we used 50 , 100 , 300 , 1000 and 3000 @xmath46 .",
    ", as a function of the logarithm of the radial distance in pc , for cored isothermal halos characterised by a velocity dispersion of @xmath47 and central density values of 50 , 100 , 300 , 1000 and 3000 @xmath46 , top to bottom respectively .",
    "the horizontal red line gives @xmath48 , with values above indicative of a central mondian spike .",
    ", width=340,height=264 ]    once the full density profiles and corresponding mass profiles @xmath49 were calculated , we evaluated the ratio between the radial coordinate and the local mond radius of @xmath50 .",
    "the result is shown in figure ( 1 ) , where said ratio appears as a function of the logarithm of the radial distance for the cored isothermal halos mentioned above , top to bottom for decreasing value of the central density .",
    "the horizontal line in the figure gives @xmath48 , with the central mondian region appearing interior to the first crossing of the corresponding curves and this line .",
    "these crossing points are always within a few percent of the analytic estimates for rigorously constant stellar density cores of equation ( 2 ) .",
    "we now solve for the newtonian central black hole mass required to reproduce the actual mondian radial force within the internal @xmath15 region , when added to the newtonian force produced by the actual stellar density profile present , i.e. , we solve for @xmath32 from equation ( 4 ) , using this time the full cored isothermal @xmath49 profiles described above .",
    "the results are shown in figure ( 2 ) , where in a log - log plot we give the central black hole mass which would be inferred under a newtonian modelling of dynamical tracers observed within the halos described above .",
    "it is interesting that the actual maximum values for these masses , and the radii at which these occur , are never more than a few percent off from the rigorously constant stellar density core results of the previous section .",
    "as expected from the analytic results , the maximum black hole mass appears just inside the onset of the central mondian spike , the @xmath51 functions in figure ( 2 ) drop very abruptly shortly after reaching their maxima .     and",
    "central density values of 50 , 100 , 300 , 1000 and 3000 @xmath46 , top to bottom respectively . maximum values and corresponding radii",
    "are within a few percent of the results of equation ( 9 ) for flat cores of the same densities.,width=340,height=264 ]    going back to figure ( 1 ) , we see that the inner mondian region extends outwards as the central density assumed is reduced , in consistency with equation ( 3 ) . in going to progressively lower densities",
    ", the inner @xmath1 region extends to cover a growing percentage of the cluster extent , until a density threshold is reached at which the inner mondian region extends into the typical @xmath1 outer low acceleration one , and the globular cluster appears entirely mondian . indeed , such is the case of ngc 288 , a very low desnsity system fully within the low acceleration regime . as expected under mondian gravity , hernandez et al .",
    "( 2017 ) recently found that this cluster shows no drop in its velocity dispersion profile , being fully isothermal and fully consistent in both velocity dispersion and projected surface density profiles with mondian dynamical models .    over the past years",
    ", a number of authors have claimed inferences of black holes at the centres of galactic globular clusters , e.g. ibata et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , feldmeier et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and kamann et al .",
    "black hole claims in globular clusters remain controversial , as direct searches looking for any central nuclear activity tend to return only upper limits on the putative black hole masses , e.g. maccarone & servillat ( 2010 ) , lu & kong ( 2011 ) and strader et al .",
    "indeed , baumgardt ( 2017 ) through an extensive newtonian grid of n - body simulations calibrated to specific globular clusters where black hole masses have been claimed , finds that no such black holes are needed , or are even compatible with the observed joint surface density and velocity dispersion observations , above about @xmath41 , much below the typical claimed black hole masses .",
    "the only exception to the above is the case of @xmath52 cen , where baumgardt ( 2017 ) does find evidence for a @xmath53 central black hole .    in the context of our study ,",
    "given the central densities of the globular clusters for which central black holes have been inferred , of order @xmath54 and above ( harris 1996 ) , the recent results of baumgardt ( 2017 ) are consistent , as we would expect only very small `` black hole '' masses to be required under newtonian modelling of the central mondian region of these clusters of less than @xmath55 c.f .",
    "equation ( 9 ) .",
    "it is of course not impossible that some of these globular clusters , due to dynamical evolution processes and their high stellar densities , might actually contain central black holes , as might probably be the case of @xmath52 cen .",
    "indeed , the added central potential produced by the inner mondian region could play a part in enhancing the formation efficiency of central black holes in globular clusters .",
    "the effect presented here is falsifiable , the lack of any inferred black hole ( under newtonian assumptions ) at the level of the predictions of equation ( 9 ) for suitably located dynamical tracers , would clearly invalidate the hypothesis of the analysis presented , and challenge the mondian view point .",
    "thus , a prediction remains for gravitational anomalies in the centres of lower central density globular clusters .",
    "a more solid understanding of the effect of this central mondian region in the context of dynamical evolution , mass segregation and n - body relaxation of globular clusters lies beyond the scope of this first presentation of the effect , but would certainly be desirable to more fully asses its consequences .",
    "we have shown that for stellar density profiles having a central cusp shallower than @xmath56 , an inner low acceleration region will exist where @xmath1 . for the particular case of a constant density core of density @xmath20",
    ", the extent of this inner region will be of @xmath57 .    under mondian gravity",
    ", this implies that within this inner region , dynamical tracers will behave as if under the gravitational influence of an extra mass component , when interpreted under newtonian assumptions .",
    "if this extra potential under newtonian interpretations is ascribed to a central black hole , its mass will depend on the radial range over which dynamical tracers are used , with a maximum inferred black hole mass of @xmath58    the previous expression becomes hence a prediction for newtonian inferences from volume resolved dynamics of @xmath59 galactic globular clusters .",
