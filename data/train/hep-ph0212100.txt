    "mesonic @xmath0 states are the simplest color - singlet configurations in qcd . however",
    ", physical mesons appear to be much more complicated objects , in view of the quite disparate spectra of especially the light scalars and pseudoscalars , and the large variety of states ranging from ozi - stable quarkonia to extremely broad , often badly established resonances . because of these complexities",
    ", theoretical approaches usually focus on parts of the meson data only .",
    "thus , one has quarkonium potential models ( see e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite ) , relativistic constituent quark models ( see e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite ) , chiral quark models ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , heavy - quark effective theory @xcite , the linear @xmath2 model ( l@xmath2 m ) @xcite , nambu  jona - lasinio models @xcite , ( unitarized ) chiral perturbation theory @xcite ) , meson - exchange models ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and so on . while it lies outside the scope of this short paper to describe in detail the respective merits and drawbacks of all these approaches , on",
    "can generally state that a good reproduction of either spectra or scattering data is achieved , often at the cost of a non - negligible number of free fit parameters , but without accomplishing a unified description of mesonic spectra and meson - meson scattering .",
    "in our view , however , spectra and scattering of mesons are inexorably intertwined concepts , considering that most mesons are resonances , decaying strongly into final states of two or more lighter mesons .",
    "therefore , we believe one should treat the mechanisms responsible for quark confinement and for mesonic decay on an equal footing .",
    "this we have realized already in an essentially non - relativistic ( nr ) framework , employing the coupled - channel schrdinger formalism , with several confined @xmath0 channels and many free two - meson channels . for a detailed discussion of the configuration - space model",
    ", we refer to a separate contribution @xcite to this workshop , so let us just emphasize here some important non - perturbative features . from the spectroscopic point of view , meson - loop effects on the @xmath0 spectra are included to all ( ladder ) orders , even those resulting from closed meson - meson channels .",
    "conversely , the strong influence of @xmath3-channel @xmath0 states on non - exotic meson - meson scattering is taken into account .",
    "furthermore , bound states , resonances , and scattering observables all follow directly from an analytic @xmath4-matrix derived in closed form , thus dispensing with any kind of perturbative methods , which could be highly untrustworthy for the often very large couplings involved . as a matter of fact ,",
    "perhaps the most remarkable conquest of the model is its parameter - free prediction of the light scalar mesons @xcite , including the @xmath5(800 ) ( @xmath6 ) @xcite , which has very recently been experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "precisely for the light scalars , perturbation theory manifestly breaks down @xcite .",
    "other coupled - channel , also called unitarized , approaches are due to eichten _",
    "et al . _ ( ref .",
    "@xcite , first paper ) , bicudo & ribeiro ( ref .",
    "@xcite , fourth paper ) , and trnqvist with collaborators ( ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the conclusions of the latter two models are in qualitative agreement with ours , in the sense that large shifts are found owing to unitarization , even for ( bare ) states below the lowest decay threshold . however , in the case of the scalar mesons , important differences between our model and especially the one of ref .",
    "@xcite come to light , as the @xmath5(800 ) is not found in the latter reference ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed comparison ) .    notwithstanding its successes , our coordinate - space model has , of course , a number of shortcomings .",
    "first of all , the light pseudoscalar mesons are quite badly off , except for the kaon .",
    "this may be due to the largely nr formalism without dirac spin structure , the disregard of chiral symmetry , and possibly also the neglect of scalar - pseudoscalar two - meson channels .",
    "moreover , for most processes , the experimental meson - meson phase shifts are only roughly and not very accurately reproduced , which is no wonder in view of the neglect of final - state interactions from direct @xmath7-channel meson exchange , and the absence of any `` fitting freedom '' .",
    "then there are problems with pseudothresholds in heavy - light systems , owing to the non - covariance of minimally relativistic equations in configuration space .",
    "finally , too many , viz .  3 , parameters",
    " albeit a very modest number as compared to other approaches  are needed for the @xmath1 transition potential , due to the lack of a microscopic description in terms of quark exchange .",
    "nevertheless , we are convinced one can deal with these shortcomings by reformulating the model in momentum space , in a covariant three - dimensional ( 3d ) quasipotential framework .",
    "here , one could object why we do not attempt to tackle the full bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation .",
    "the reason is twofold : first of all , the numerical effort to solve the resulting coupled 4d integro - differential equations with many channels would be enormous ; but perhaps more importantly , the confinement mechanism employing potentials is an inherently 3d concept , possibly leading to a pathological , non - confining behavior when generalized to four dimensions ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite , third paper ) .",
    "anyhow , a covariant formulation would also allow to include , at a later stage , the dirac spin structure of the quarks , and address the issue of dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking and generation of constituent mass .",
    "the resulting multichannel equations in momentum space we shall show to be explicitly solvable , provided we stick to harmonic confinement and work on a spline basis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the good old harmonic oscillator ( ho ) is solved in momentum space using the spline technique , for two different 3d relativistic equations . in sec .",
    "3 a two - channel toy model , with one harmonically confined @xmath0 channel coupled via quark exchange to one free two - meson channel , is formally solved in closed form , employing again a spline expansion .",
    "conclusions and an outlook on how to further develop the model are presented in sec .",
    "in this section , we review the well - known 3d ho , first in coordinate space , and then in momentum space . in the latter representation , a 3d relativistic generalization is straightforward .",
    "the equal - mass radial schrdinger equation ( se ) for a local potential reads @xmath8 if we take the ho potential @xmath9 define @xmath10 , and assume for the moment @xmath11 , we get @xmath12 the spectrum of the 3d ho potential is very well known , viz.(@xmath11 ) @xmath13 leading to the eigenvalues @xmath14 for eq .",
    "( 3 ) .    alternatively",
    ", we can work in momentum space .",
    "the homogeneous lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation for the bound - state vertex function reads @xmath15 where the free two - body green s function is given by @xmath16 now define the wave function @xmath17 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( 5 ) becomes @xmath18 or equivalently @xmath19 this is just the se in momentum space . in this representation , the ho potential is given by @xmath20 which is local as in coordinate space .",
    "substituting into ( 8) yields @xmath21 taking again @xmath11 and introducing @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath24 if we define the dimensionless variable @xmath25 and write @xmath26 , we get @xmath27 this is identical to eq .  ( 3 ) . note that now the roles of the kinetic and the potential term are interchanged .",
    "the momentum - space equal - mass ( scalar ) bslt @xcite equation for the wave function has exactly the same form as in the ls case of eq .",
    "( 7 ) , but now with center - of - mass ( cm ) green s function @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath3 is the total cm energy squared @xmath30 . note that @xmath31 can be derived in a completely covariant fashion , and written down explicitly for an arbitrary frame @xcite . in the nr limit",
    "we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 , recovering the ls green s function ( 6 ) . with the new @xmath34",
    ", we get instead of eq .",
    "( 8) @xmath35 in terms of the above - defined dimensionless variable @xmath36 , the bslt equation becomes @xmath37 from this equation we readily see that deviations from the ls case are determined by the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , in the limit @xmath39 , the eigenvalues @xmath14 get recovered . however , there are additional relativistic effects due to @xmath40",
    ".      the et , also called mandelzweig  wallace @xcite , green s function can be obtained from the bslt ( or salpeter ) equation by adding an extra term @xmath41 to the two - body green s function @xmath42 which approximates crossed - ladder contributions .",
    "this extra term becomes exact in the eikonal limit , or when one of the particles gets infinitely heavy .",
    "therefore , the covariant et equation manifestly has the correct one - body limit , i.e. , one recovers either the klein  gordon or the dirac equation , for scalar or spin-[relho]/2 particles , respectively . in the scalar case , the cm et green s function",
    "is given by @xmath43 the final form of the @xmath4-wave et equation for the ho potential in momentum space reads @xmath44 \\frac{d^2}{dy^2}\\right\\ } v(y ) \\ ; = \\ ; \\frac{s-4m^2}{2m\\omega}\\ : \\left\\{1\\,-\\,\\frac{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\omega}{2m}}{\\left(\\displaystyle1 + \\frac{\\omega}{2m}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\ , \\frac{d^2}{dy^2 } \\right\\}v(y ) \\;.\\ ] ]      for @xmath45 , the dimensionless ls equation becomes @xmath46 in order to numerically solve the ls and corresponding bslt , et equations , we substitute @xmath47",
    ". then @xmath48 the function @xmath49 has the right boundary conditions to allow an easy numerical solution using an expansion on a spline basis ( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite and second paper of ref .",
    "thus , the nr ho spectrum is recovered with great accuracy , viz.@xmath50 +    in the case of the bslt and et equations , the same can be done by replacing everywhere @xmath51 the ls , bslt , and et results for @xmath11 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ relho ] .",
    "we see that the relativistic corrections are relatively modest for the bslt equation , but can become huge in the et case , especially for excited states .",
    "the latter large effect has to do with the sign change of the et propagator ( 16 ) as a function of the relative momentum , and has also been observed in the dirac case ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , second paper ) .",
    "however , this overshooting of the et equation will strongly depend on the chosen dirac structure of the confining force in a realistic model , and hence should not cause any worries at this stage .",
    "consider now a simple two - channel model of one confined @xmath0 system coupled to one free meson - meson channel . in a unitarized picture , this can formally be described by a @xmath52 @xmath53 matrix , with the dynamical equation ( ls , bslt , or et ) @xmath54 equation ( 22 ) is diagrammatically represented in fig .",
    "[ tij ] .",
    "dashed lines are mesons , solid lines with arrows are ( anti)quarks , and curly exchanges symbolize confinement .",
    "furthermore , open circles represent meson - quark - antiquark vertices , and dots stand for three - meson vertices .",
    "note that the communication between the @xmath0 and two - meson channels takes place through quark exchange .",
    "this will give rise to a generally non - local @xmath1 transition potential in configuration space , as soon as the quarks and mesons have different masses .",
    "the precise form of such a potential will also depend on possible form factors to be attributed to the various vertices .    in order to solve eq .",
    "( 22 ) , we must realize that no asymptotic scattering of quarks is possible , so @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 must in the end be eliminated from the equations : only @xmath58 can be on shell .",
    "if we now take again harmonic confinement , eq .",
    "( 22 ) becomes a set of coupled integro - differential equations .",
    "omitting for clarity angular - momentum indices , we get e.g.  for @xmath56 @xmath59 note that @xmath60 is an essentially dummy variable in the equations , so we can choose a fixed value for it , say @xmath61 .",
    "if we now expand @xmath56 and @xmath58 on a spline basis and discretize the initial momentum @xmath62 , then @xmath56 can be expressed in terms of @xmath58 as follows .",
    "@xmath63 + @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 combining eqs .",
    "( 24)(27 ) , we can write @xmath67 where the boldface capitals and small letters are obvious shorthands for matrices and vectors , respectively",
    ". turning next to @xmath58 , we get the integral equation @xmath68 similarly to eqs .",
    "( 24)(27 ) , we define now @xmath69",
    "@xmath70 then we can express @xmath71 in terms of itself , using eq .",
    "( 28 ) : + @xmath72 + this finally leads to @xmath73 @xmath74    thus , we have obtained a closed - form expression for the @xmath53 matrix ( hence the @xmath4 matrix ) , containing the _ complete _ information of the confinement - plus - scattering process .",
    "needless to say that all these algebraic manipulations only make sense if the involved integrals actually exist and the spline expansions converge .",
    "yet , we are confident this will be the case when appropriate boundary conditions are chosen , since the same spline expansion we are using here has been successfully applied to few - body scattering calculations in momentum space @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the dirac case , to be dealt with in the future , form factors will have to be included for the meson - quark - antiquark vertices so as to make the integrals involving three quark propagators convergent . in any case ,",
    "such form factors are physically meaningful , and should therefore already be considered in the approximation with spinless fermions , whenever doing phenomenology .",
    "bound states and resonances are given by zeroes in the determinant of the inverted - matrix factor right after the equal sign in eq .",
    "resonance poles in the second riemann sheet can be searched for by analytic continuation to complex energies , using e.g.  contour - rotation methods . moreover , from the structure of the equations one readily sees that the inclusion of final - state interactions , due to @xmath7-channel meson exchange in the meson - meson channel , simply amounts to taking a non - vanishing @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( 29 ) , which will not lead to any additional numerical effort .",
    "finally , the generalization to many scattering channels and also more @xmath0 channels is straightforward , at the expense of bigger matrices .",
    "in the foregoing , we have demonstrated that the formulation of a unitarized quark / meson model with harmonic confinement is relatively easy in momentum space .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 mechanism is dynamically described through @xmath76-wave quark exchange .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of final - state interactions via @xmath7-channel meson exchange is straightforward , and does not complicate the structure of the equations .",
    "the numerical resolution of these equations using splines looks very convenient , which should result in ( approximate ) analytic solutions , thereby facilitating an analytic continuation to complex energies in order to search for resonance poles .",
    "our first priority is , of course , to achieve a total control of the numerics , for real as well as complex energy .",
    "then a simple toy model will be worked out so as to reproduce known coordinate - space results .",
    "furthermore , cases problematic in the configuation - space formulation will be studied , such as heavy - light mesons .",
    "also , the influence of @xmath7-channel meson exchange on meson - meson phase shifts will be investigated . in a somewhat more distant perspective , we intend to do a lot of phenomenology , and use the feedback to further refine the model . +",
