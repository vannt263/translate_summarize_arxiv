    "to prepare two identically , polarization squeezed modes we use a well known technique like in  @xcite .",
    "each of these modes is generated by launching two orthogonally polarized femtosecond pulses ( @xmath76200fs ) with balanced powers onto the two birefringent axes of a polarization maintaining fiber ( fs - pm-7811 , thorlabs , 13 m ) .",
    "the pump source is a soliton - laser emitting light at a center wavelength of 1559 nm and a repetition rate of 80mhz . by exploiting the optical kerr effect of the fibers , the orthogonally polarized pulses are individually quadrature squeezed and",
    "subsequently temporally overlapped with a relative phase of @xmath38 , resulting in a circular polarized light beam . the relative phase is actively controlled using an interferometric birefringence compensator including a piezoelectric transducer and a locking loop based on a 0.1% tap - off signal after the fiber . in terms of stokes observables ( see  @xcite ) this results in states with zero mean values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , but a bright @xmath77 component .",
    "these states exhibit polarization squeezing at a particular angle in the @xmath30-@xmath31-plane .",

    "the present protocol relies on gaussian quantum states . as any standard gaussian distribution , a gaussian state @xmath85",

    "it then follows that this gaussian state is classical and it therefore transforms to a separable state after the first beam splitter .",
    "the inversion ( [ gammaac ] ) thus allows us to associate a gaussian state before the phase fluctuations with the covariance matrix @xmath43 measured after the first beam splitter .",

    "its gaussianity is visualized by the gaussian fit ( red curve ) . ]    besides this raw visual check we have also tested quantitatively gaussianity of the involved states by measuring higher - order moments of the stokes measurements on modes @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
    "specifically , we have focused on the determination of the shape measures called skewness @xmath139 and kurtosis @xmath140 defined for a random variable @xmath18 as the following third and fourth standardized moments @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the @xmath143th central moment , @xmath144 is the mean value and @xmath145 is the standard deviation .",
    "skewness characterizes the orientation and the amount of skew of a given distribution and therefore informs us about its asymmetry in the horizontal direction .",

    "the exemplary values of kurtosis for various measurement settings are summarized in the table  [ ktable ] .",

    "<S> effects that could possibly lead to some non - gaussianity of the utilized states are also discussed in detail in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> the state described by @xmath43 fulfils the condition  ( [ pptcondition ] ) as the eigenvalues ( 39.84 , 28.47 , 13.85 , and 9.371 ) of @xmath64 are positive ; hence , mode @xmath7 remains separable after bs@xmath6 .    the measured two - mode covariance matrix of the output state @xmath39 is given by @xmath65 the statistical error of this measured covariance matrix is given in the appendix . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath10 is completely removed . </S>",
    "<S> a part of the classical noise associated with @xmath66 is subtracted from @xmath67 , while the same fraction of the noise in @xmath68 is added to @xmath69 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the noise partially cancels out in the calculation of the separability criterion  ( [ duan ] ) and allows us to reveal the entanglement . </S>",

    "<S> . bob verifies that the product entanglement criterion  ( [ duan ] ) is fulfilled , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : duan ] . that proves the emergence of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the used gain factor @xmath25 considers the slightly different detector response and the intentional loss of 50% at bob s beam splitter . the clearest confirmation of entanglement @xmath71 is shown for @xmath72 ( fig .  [ fig : duan ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the only step of the protocol , where entanglement emerges , thus demonstrating the remarkable possibility to entangle remote parties alice and bob solely by sending a separable auxiliary mode @xmath7 .     and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental values for the criterion ( [ duan ] ) are depicted in dependence of the gain factor @xmath25 . because of the attenuation of mode @xmath1 by 50% , a gain factor of about 0.5 yields a value smaller than 1 , i.e. , below the limit for entanglement ( solid red line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset zooms into the interesting section around the minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the depicted estimated errors are so small because of the large amount of data taken . ]    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ discussion ] ] discussion + + + + + + + + + +    the performance of the protocol can be explained using the structure of the displacements ( [ displacements ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement distribution without sending entanglement highlights vividly the important role played by classical information in quantum information protocols . </S>",
    "<S> classical information lies in our knowledge about all the correlated displacement involved . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the communicating parties ( or david on their behalf ) to adjust the displacements locally to recover through clever noise addition quantum resources initially present in the input quantum squeezed states . </S>",
    "<S> mode @xmath7 transmitted from alice to bob carries on top of the sub - shot - noise quadrature of the input squeezed state the displacement noise which is anticorrelated with the displacement noise of bob s mode . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when the modes are interfered on bob s beam splitter , this noise partially cancels out in the output mode @xmath10 when the light quadratures of both modes add . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the residual noise in bob s position ( momentum ) quadrature is correlated ( anticorrelated ) with the displacement noise in alice s position ( momentum ) quadrature in mode @xmath9 , again initially squeezed . </S>",
    "<S> because of this , the product of variances in criterion ( [ duan ] ) drops below the value for separable states , and thus entanglement between alice and bob s modes emerges . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the theoretically proposed protocol  @xcite and the experimental demonstration reported in this letter lies merely in the way classical information is used . in the original protocol , the classical information is retained by david and he is responsible for clever tailoring of correlated noise . </S>",
    "<S> bob evokes the required noise cancellation by carrying out the final part of the global operation via superimposing his mode with the ancilla on bs@xmath8 . in the experimentally implemented protocol , david shares part of his information with bob , giving bob a possibility to get entanglement _ a posteriori _ , by using his part of the classical information after the quantum operation is carried out . </S>",
    "<S> thus entanglement distribution in our case is truly performed via a dual classical and quantum channel , via classical information exchange in combination with the transmission of separable quantum states .    </S>",
    "<S> there are other interesting aspects to this protocol , which may open new , promising avenues for research . </S>",
    "<S> noise introduced into the initial states by displacements contains specific classical correlations . on a more fundamental level </S>",
    "<S> , these displacements can be seen as correlated dissipation ( including mode @xmath2 into the `` environment '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is already known that dissipation to a common reservoir can even lead to the creation of entanglement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme can be viewed as another manifestation of a positive role dissipation may play in quantum protocols .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of correlated noise results in nonzero gaussian discord at all stages of the protocol , a more general form of quantum correlations , which are beyond entanglement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of discord in entanglement distribution has recently been discussed theoretically  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the requirements devised there are reflected in the particular separability properties of our global state after the interaction of modes @xmath0 and @xmath2 on alice s beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath73 contains discord and entanglement across @xmath74 splitting and is separable and discordant across @xmath75 splitting as required by the protocol . </S>",
    "<S> our work thus illustrates an interplay of entanglement and other quantum correlations , such as correlations described by discord , across different partitions of a multipartite quantum system .    </S>",
