    "in the standard treatment of common envelope ( ce ) outcomes via the `` energy formalism '' @xcite , the final separation of the binary is determined by equating the binding energy of the ( shunned ) envelope @xmath0 to the decrease in the orbital energy @xmath1 :    @xmath2    here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the initial and final binary separations , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the initial star masses and @xmath7 is the final mass of the star that lost its envelope .",
    "@xmath0 is considered to be the sum of the potential energy of the envelope and its internal energy , and can be found directly from stellar structure for any accepted core mass ( there are also modifications for @xmath0 , where ionization energy or enhanced winds are taken into account , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "is introduced , @xmath14 , to measure the energy transfer efficiency from the orbital energy into envelope expansion :    @xmath15    we anticipate that introduction of the two parameters introduced accordingly two uncertainties . it is common to remove these uncertainties _ at the same time _ , considering the product of @xmath14 and @xmath9 , by means of comparison of observations with the binary population synthesis calculations , where the product of the two parameters is varied to match the observations . however",
    ", this approach has shown inconsistencies with the observations , especially large for the formation rates of black hole lmxbs @xcite .",
    "in particular , for lmxbs this required @xmath16 @xcite , although in massive giants @xmath17 @xcite , and @xmath14 is bound to be @xmath18 .",
    "the other way to reduce uncertainties is to consider them separately , e.g.  one can try to determine an ` accurate ' value of @xmath9 from stellar structure calculations .",
    "it is then crucial to be precise about the definition of the core  should only the hydrogen envelope be removed , or together with the h - burning shell , and so on @xcite . without knowing what exactly counts as the core and which material ought to be ejected",
    ", the inferred @xmath9 can vary by a factor of several _ from this uncertainty alone_.",
    "the physical reason for this variation is that in giants , within the hydrogen shell , the potential is strongly increasing towards the core .",
    "the uncertainty increases as the mass of the donor increases , and changes from a about a factor of 2 in intermediate mass stars at early giant stage to a factor of 20 and more for well - evolved massive stars @xcite .",
    "we stress that neither observations nor theory provide now a strong constraint on what post - ce remnant mass should be at the moment when the _ dynamical _ phase of the ejection ends .",
    "it does not have to be the same as the mass of the remnant that we observe now , e.g. , in double white - dwarf ( wd ) systems or in sub - dwarf b stars : some remaining post - ce hydrogen - rich material can be easily removed through strong winds similar to those on horizontal branch , or asymptotic giant branch , or in wolf - rayet stars etc . between the dynamical phase and long - term evolution ,",
    "the core will readjust itself on a thermal time - scale , and this has not been addressed . here , we address the problem of what the post - ejection mass could be , different regimes in which a post - ce remnant can shed its remaining hydrogen - rich mass and the consequences for a companion due to post - ce mass transfer .",
    "in sph simulations of physical _ collisions _ between a rg and a neutron star ( ns ) it has been found that not all hydrogen material is ejected along with the envelope  a tiny layer of hydrogen , from the h - burning shell , remains @xcite .",
    "this event is not directly comparable to a typical ce event in a binary as at the time of initial approach , at periastron , the h - burning shell of the donor could have been in the immediate roche lobe of the intruder .",
    "this magnifies the mass - loss from the h - burning shell and as such can decrease the mass of the post - ce remnant compared to a typical ce , where this shell might never be in the roche lobe of the spiraling - in companion .",
    "this example makes clear that even in a dynamical ce some hydrogen - rich material always remains .    on the other hand , studies of the evolution of stripped cores of low - mass rgs ,",
    "have shown that there is a minimum `` envelope '' mass @xmath19 that has to be left on the core in order for the star to reexpand ; if less mass is left on the core the star will contract and become a wd @xcite .",
    "this expansion or contraction of the remaining shell occurs on the thermal timescale of remaining layer , @xmath20 .",
    "it is plausible therefore to suppose that there is a unique `` divergence '' point @xmath21 inside the hydrogen burning shell , such that if a post - ce star has any mass above this point , the star will continue to expand on @xmath20 .",
    "if its final mass is less than @xmath21 , the star will shrink , also on its @xmath20 .",
    "we recognise that @xmath20 might mean different values in the case of degenerate core ( applicable only to the remaining shell ) or non - degenerate core ( where it likely to depend on the core conditions ) .",
    "we expect that the material above the divergence point , if left , will expand , in order to obtain thermal equilibrium , but is not required to escape to infinity without an additional energy source ( such as the orbital energy ) . during this thermal readjustment ( tr ) , it may also fill its roche lobe .",
    "we tested this idea of `` divergence '' point on giants of several initial masses ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the stars were evolved using the stellar code and input physics described in @xcite .",
    "this code is capable of performing both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic stellar evolution calculations . for a roche lobe overflow evolution in binaries ,",
    "it finds mass loss rates implicitly .",
    "massive stars , where wind loss are important , were evolved with wind loss rates according to @xcite , or , where vink rates are not applicable , according to @xcite .",
    "for each initial mass , we chose 2 - 4 evolutionary states within the giant stage with different hydrogen - exhausted core masses @xmath23 .",
    "as during the advanced evolution stages stars can shrink , we ensured that the chosen giants had expanded to their current radius for the first time . on these giants",
    ", we imposed very fast ( `` adiabatic '' ) mass loss , @xmath24/year .",
    "such timescale for the mass - loss @xmath25  about several initial binary orbits  is comparable with a fast ce event .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath26 should be clear as a ce event has to happen over at least one binary period at the initial roche lobe overflow .",
    "we do not imply that a ce ejection features a constant fast mass loss , and also do not study the reaction of the outer ( convective ) envelope .",
    "we are interested in the reaction of the inner layers , which are most likely to remain after the envelope ejection has occurred .    for each mass coordinate , let us compare @xmath25 with the local thermal timescale @xmath27 and the local dynamical timescale @xmath28 : the mass - loss and the star evolution will be adiabatic if @xmath29 . the evolution can be described by hydrostatic approximation if @xmath30 , as a star will always acquire its hydrostatic equilibrium within a dynamical time , and its state at the hydrostatic equilibrium is defined by its thermal structure .     and the local dynamical time - scale @xmath28 with the mass - loss time - scale @xmath25 .",
    "shown in the case of @xmath31 ( zams mass @xmath32 , considered when @xmath33 ) . [ timescale ] ]    for most stars , @xmath25 is much shorter than any local thermal timescale ( see fig .",
    "[ timescale ] ) .",
    "we note however that in the inner layers that are close to the cores of our most massive stars ( 20 and 30 @xmath34 ) , the complete mass - loss sequence can take up to 10% of the local thermal timescale of a few hundred years .",
    "thus , even such a fast mass - loss produces only approximately adiabatic evolution : some thermal evolution proceeds and is expected to be responsible , in particular , for some expansion of inner non - degenerate layers during the ce phase . as a sanity check , we calculated additional mass - loss sequences for massive stars , with faster and slower mass - loss rates , and found only minor differences in the region of interest between the runs with @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    ".    on the other hand , local dynamical time - scales are longest at the surface and significantly shorter for innermost layers ( fig .",
    "[ timescale ] ) .",
    "@xmath28 is comparable by the order of magnitude to @xmath25 in the outer layer of the massive giants .",
    "@xmath28 is however by 3 or more orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath25 in the helium rich layers , and closer to hydrogen exhausted core , it is @xmath37 , even in our most massive considered stars . therefore , although the evolution of the outer layers is indeed dependent on the inclusion of hydrodynamical terms , the inner layers always have enough time to regain hydrostatic equilibrium , and are therefore insensitive under the adopted mass - loss rate . in summary , we find that for studies of the thermal reaction of inner layers that will form the remnant after the fast envelope ejection , the hydrostatic version of the code is sufficient .    as a result of mass loss evolution , we obtained sequences of ( post - ce ) remnants with different final ( post - ce ) masses , each of which then was evolved for several @xmath20 , to check if this post - ce star is expanding or contracting .",
    "we note that in our code the value of post - ce mass could be resolved no better than pre - ce resolution in hydrogen shell , this is specifically important for low - mass giants ( e.g. , we have about 50 mesh points per @xmath38 h - shell in 2 @xmath34 rg with a @xmath39 )",
    ".    to summarize , we separate the ce event into two stages : one resulting in the envelope ejection , and the subsequent thermal readjustment of the remnant .",
    "the latter part is a distinct phase unless the spiral - in ( including the ejection of the envelope ) takes place on a time - scale comparable to the shortest thermal time scale , several hundred years ; and has not been heretofore treated in the literature .",
    "finally , an admonishment is in order : several estimates exist for the ce duration , neither one of them can boast conclusive observational evidence or indeed self - consistency .",
    "e.g. , a ` slow ' ce could last for 100 years and longer @xcite .",
    "we can not justify which ce evolution timescale is more appropriate , and this is not the purpose of this paper .",
    "we concentrate on the ` fast ' event , however , we see no reason why our results should not be applicable in the ` slow ' case : the core reaction will be similar , albeit lagging by the time the ejection takes .",
    "we also note that a 10-times slower loss rate did not produce a significant difference in our calculations .",
    "indeed , as in previous studies , we found that every low - mass giant with a degenerate core has a unique divergence point @xmath40 such that if post - ce mass is less than @xmath40 , it contracts on @xmath20 .",
    "all post - ce remnant with masses above @xmath40 expand , create new outer convective zone and keep expanding even after @xmath20 .    after locating @xmath40 , we analyzed pre - ce giants structure to find what characteristics these points had in initial giants , before the stripping began .",
    "for this , all giants , including massive , were used .",
    "we noticed that among all the giants , @xmath40 could have initially a wide range of hydrogen content , @xmath41 , and so a criterion involving specific constant value of hydrogen abundance could not be satisfactory . similarly ,",
    "another criterion discussed in the literature  the location where the energy generation rate is maximum @xcite  does not coincide with the divergence point .",
    "we found that in the considered models @xmath40 is close to the `` maximal compression point ''",
    "@xmath42 , which is the mass zone with the maximum value of ` compression ' @xmath43 in the hydrogen shell .      for massive giants , as previously , a post - ce remnant also has divergence point that corresponds to the minimum post - ce expansion of the remnant , although the overall response is different from the case of the giants with degenerate cores :    * for all possible remnant masses with @xmath44 , the core slightly adiabatically expands during the fast adiabatic mass loss .",
    "once we stop the mass loss , it can very slightly ( a few per cent ) expand and then shrink dramatically , becoming smaller than it was before the ce .",
    "* for larger remnant masses , as previously , the convective envelope is re - formed , and the star remains as an extended giant for a while .",
    "the envelope can become larger than the pre - ce giant .",
    "* for the intermediate range of remnant masses , above the @xmath42 , but below the boundary where the convective zone redevelops , the core experiences a pulse on @xmath45 , being able to expand by up to few hundred times more than this mass had as a radius coordinate before the ce . after the pulse ,",
    "the post - ce star shrinks significantly , also becoming smaller than prior the ce .    to illustrate these three types of the response , in fig .",

    "[ core_20_casec ] ) .",
    "even though this giant has profile of hydrogen qualitatively different from the considered above @xmath47 star , it shows similar behavior .",
    "the main difference with a @xmath50 star is that there is a more contrasting response between inside @xmath42 and outside it . in a @xmath51 giant",
    "this difference even stronger as @xmath42 is located just below the bottom of hydrogen burning _ convective _ zone .",

    "it is established that adiabatic response of the surface layers depend on whether they are radiative or convective @xcite . in particular ,",
    "radiative layers on dynamical timescale tend to shrink , and convective layer remain the same or expand .",
    "we checked for all considered model the location of the divergence point and found that all of them are located within initially ( pre - ce ) radiative layers .",
    "we conclude that immediate response for mass removal to the divergence point is always a shrinkage and therefore does not affect our conclusions based on the thermal response .",
    "as the core expands during semi - adiabatic mass - loss , a surviving binary must be _ wider _ when core expansion is taken into account .",
    "thus more binaries will merge ( this result is _ opposite _ to the claim in * ? ? ?",
    "as an example , the giant in fig .  [ core_20_casec ] will easily survive a ce event with a ns of @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 ) if its core did not expand . setting core mass @xmath61 will satisfy the energy budget to create a compact binary .",

    "let us consider what happens if the companion was massive enough so that during ce not all mass to @xmath42 had to be removed . in this case a ce would end with a binary separation such that roche lobe overflow for a post - ce remnant during its tr will follow . to consider this",

    "as expected , the post - ce remnant rapidly expanded and started the mt ; initially at a very high rate ( @xmath85/yr ) , in accordance to @xmath20 of the remaining hydrogen rich layer . after removing most of the layer above @xmath42 , it slowed down to @xmath20 of the core ( @xmath86/yr ) .",
    "the mt continued till mt rates become comparable to the tr time - scale so that the core can shrink faster than it expands due to mass loss . in this particular example",
    "the core reached almost exactly the divergence point , shedding @xmath87 during the mt so that the final mass was @xmath42 .",
    "we also performed a mt calculation in the fully non - conservative regime . in this case the final mass of the core after the tr phase is the same as in the conservative calculations .",
    "we also considered the case when the companion is a ns .",
    "we note that with a @xmath32 donor then , even for @xmath60 , the energy requirements for envelope ejection would not be satisfied if the core expands as much as we find after our fast mass loss ( i.e. the binary would merge ) .",
    "the final mass of the remnant of the massive giant is the same , @xmath42 , as for the @xmath88 companion . if the mass transfer is fully conservative , the ns is presumably spun - up , as it would accumulate @xmath89 .",
    "again , in the case of a fully non- conservative regime , we find that the final mass of the post - ce remnant is @xmath42 .",
    "next we considered a system with a @xmath50 giant ( same as shown in fig .",
    "[ core_10_casea ] ) , considering as the post - ce core @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) . in our mt simulations with a ns companion , less material above @xmath42 has been transferred , only @xmath92 , the final remnant mass is @xmath93 .",
    "it might be connected to the fact that 10 @xmath34 star does not have such a sharp profile as a @xmath32 in the post - ce thermal pulse zone , and its post - ce expansion is more flatter until about this mass ( see fig .",
    "[ core_10_casea ] ) . with a smaller companion mass ,",
    "more of the post - ce remnant mass is stripped off .",
    "the mt rates that we encounter in the post - ce tr phase are highly super - eddington and we face the obvious question whether the mt is approximately conservative or almost non - conservative , as this is crucial for a companion .",
    "the question what happens if the mass - accretion rate on a ns exceeds eddington limit has been discussed extensively in the literature , in particular , the regime in which it exceeds @xmath94 _ by many orders of magnitude_.    @xcite showed that if the accretion rate is extremely high , few times @xmath95 , then within some volume ( the  trapping radius  , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) around the star the diffusion of photons outward can not overcome the advection of photons inward .",
    "while a black hole can swallow all the material in this case , if the accretor is a ns , radiation pressure near the ns s surface resists inflow in excess of the eddington limit , likely leading to creation of a thorne - ztkov object .",
    "@xcite has also found that when mt rates exceed the eddington rate by @xmath96 or more , the accretion proceeds in a hypercritical regime .",
    "hypercritical accretion was then argued to be responsible for such efficient material accumulation during a ce event , that a ns is likely to convert to a black hole @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this argument to understand double ns formation .",
    "he showed that indeed in a ce event the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion rate is about @xmath97 and a ns can accumulate up to @xmath98 .",
    "he argued that in this case , considering that a number of the discovered double ns have masses closer to the lowest possible ns mass limit , a double ns can be formed only from a binary with almost similar initial masses , evolving then via double ce event , before either of the nss was formed .",
    "@xcite considered neutrino losses during accretion on a ns .",
    "they studied in detail the regimes of the mass accretion @xmath99 , and found that radiation diffusion becomes important when the accretion rate falls below @xmath100 , for smaller rates the radiation pressure can not support an envelope around ns surface and can not cease the infall of the material .",
    "we note that the accretion rate that separate the hypercritical accretion with the accretion when the radiation diffusion dominates in this case ( @xmath100 ) is higher than the one found to work during a ce event ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "if the latter estimate is more proper than in the studies listed above , then it is possible that a ce hyper - accretion , as having too low mass accretion rate , does not lead to a significant accumulation of the material .",
    "post - ce core expansion , however , in either case can lead to a hyper - accretion regime , as during this thermal pulse it provides a much higher mass accretion rate .",
    "this can lead to a ns spun up . in our calculations ,",
    "mt rates exceeded @xmath100 long enough to accrete in hypercritical regime on a ns @xmath102 in the case of @xmath32 giant and @xmath103 in the case of a @xmath47 .",
    "we note that the observed double nss are generally mildly recycled , having periods @xmath104 seconds . the mass distribution of those with mass measurement errors @xmath105",
    "are such that the difference between the masses of the nss is @xmath106 ( e.g. , see data in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their location on the @xmath107 diagram for galactic field nss is also intermediate between the millisecond pulsars and non - recycled ones @xcite , and the post - accretion period is likely to be not millisecond @xcite .",
    "it could be a sign that the very rapid mass transfer followed the ce and preceding the second ns formation is not capable to fully spin up and efficiently reduce the magnetic field on a ns that was formed first .",
    "same mechanism can lead to a formation of mildly recycled binary pulsars with low - mass white dwarf companions @xcite .",
    "we analyzed a set of giant models with respect to their likely post - ce response .",
    "although our set was not exhaustive , it did exhibit a clear trend that allowed us to conclude that : i ) every giant has a well - defined post - ce remnant after it has been thermally readjusted , most likely given by the divergence point ( see discussion below ) ; ii ) the divergence points , at the current resolution , are best approximated by the point in the hydrogen burning shell that had maximal compression ( local sonic velocity ) @xmath42 prior to ce .",
    "this definition allows us to find quickly a post - ce core mass for any giant without performing mass loss calculations .",
    "we remark that this divergence point does not necessarily mark the final mass of the remnant ( e.g. , the stellar wind in he rich stars could quickly and effectively remove the remaining hydrogen - rich envelope ) or immediate post - ejection mass , however it marks the mass after the thermal core readjustment .",
    "the post - tr core , defined by @xmath42 , most likely coincides with the post - ejection mass in low - mass giants , where reestablishing of a convective envelope for masses above the divergence point happens on a few dynamical timescales , leading to another ( likely unstable ) mt event .",
    "as the @xmath0 of remaining shells during this period has not been changed much compared to the pre - ce state , the whole sequence of events can be considered as one ce event with a final core being @xmath42 .    for giants with non - degenerate cores",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "it is not possible to claim that the divergence point defines the post - ce core ( dynamical phase ) uniquely from the energetic budget point of view .",
    "however , the divergence point does appear to define the remaining post - tr core , if the post - ce configuration allows roche lobe overflow for the post - ce remnant during the core tr . during this period , ( stable )",
    "mt can proceed , resulting in the enrichment of a companion star with material from the hydrogen - burning shell .    in all cases , the post - ce remnant of a giant with a non - degenerate core has expanded by few times by the end of tr .",
    "remnant masses greater than @xmath42 lead to greater expansion ; for each particular giant star , the minimum possible size change is for a remnant mass @xmath108 .",
    "the expansion of the remnant means that less orbital energy is available to eject the envelope than if there was no expansion , since the surviving binary must be correspondingly wider .",
    "this leads to a reduction in the number of binaries which can survive ce .",
    "so fast ce allows more binaries to survive the end of the dynamical phases .",
    "slower , self - regulating ce leads to more mergers .",
    "we note that for both types of giants @xmath42 firmly represents only a maximum post - tr core mass , as we can not fully rule out that the dynamical phase will not already have removed mass below @xmath42 .",
    "however , we argue that such extra mass loss is not likely to happen if , during the final stages of the spiral - in , the characteristic orbital evolution time is comparable to the core response time near @xmath42 point , which is as short as 10 - 100 years .",
    "we also find that in most evolved giants , the energy required to shed the envelope down to @xmath42 is the minimum energy expense : per total @xmath0 unit , it requires more orbital energy to remove either less or more of the mass from the expanded core .",
    "it is fully reasonable to remove less of the envelope ( and have a bigger post - ce mass ) once @xmath109 , the tr phase will then remove mass down to @xmath108 .",
    "however , it is not plausible to remove the envelope deeper than to @xmath108 : for any remnant mass less than @xmath42 , the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath110 increases compared to their value at @xmath42 .",
    "we suggest therefore that a divergence point uniquely defines the core in the post - tr phase , and then a slow wind loss phase follows the ce with almost no core evolution a companion can be spun up during the mt effected by the remnant s tr .",
    "roche lobe overflow phase is short , however can lead to at least mild recycling . if the companion is a ns , its recycling will depend on whether the conservative mass transfer ( due to the hypercritical accretion ) is possible or not .",
    "we find that hypercritical accretion is more likely during this tr phase than during a ce , as the mass accretion rates are significantly higher .",
    "it also leads to a smaller mass accumulation than is found to occur during a ce , corroborating the mass distributions of the observed double nss .",
    "we conclude that the post - ce tr phase can be responsible for a formation of mildly recycled pulsars in post - ce binaries and specifically in double nss .",

    "<S> we argue that the important consequences of the thermal readjustment phase are : ( i ) a change in the energy budget requirement for the ce binaries and ( ii ) a companion spin - up and chemical enrichment , as a result of the mass transfer that occurs during the remnant thermal readjustment ( tr ) . </S>",
    "<S> more ce binaries are expected to merge . if the companion is a neutron star , it will be mildly recycled during the tr phase . </S>",
    "<S> the mass transfer during the tr phase is much stronger than the accretion rate during the common envelope , and therefore satisfies the condition for a hypercritical accretion better . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue that the tr phase is responsible for a production of mildly recycled pulsars in double neutron stars . </S>"
