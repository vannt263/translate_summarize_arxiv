    "transitional disks are protoplanetary disks whose inner regions have undergone substantial clearing ( see the review by espaillat et al .",
    "recent observations suggest that gas and dust are depleted at different levels at the inner regions of these disks .",
    "compared with a full disk around a classical t tauri star , the dust surface density in the inner regions of transitional disks needs to be depleted by several orders of magnitude for producing the observed near - infrared deficit in their seds ( calvet et al .",
    ". on the other hand , the gas surface density should be similar between the inner regions of transitional disks and those of full disks ( zhu et al .",
    "2011 ) , since transitional disks and full disks have similar gas accretion rates ( najita et al .  2007 ; espaillat et al .",
    "the presence of a significant amount of gas at the inner regions of transitional disks is confirmed by molecular line observations ( najita 2008 ; ingleby et al .",
    "2009 ; salyk et al .",
    "2009 ; france et al .",
    "different distributions between dust and gas at the inner regions of transitional disks have also been supported by resolved disk observations at different wavelengths ( e.g. , near - infrared imaging and submillimeter interferometry , andrews et al .",
    "2011 ; dong et al .  2012",
    "; follette et al .",
    "2013 ; garufi et al .",
    "2013 ) , or with submillimeter interferometry using both dust continuum and molecular lines ( casassus et al .  2013 ; van der marel et al .  2013 ; bruderer et al .",
    "2014 ; menu et al .",
    "2014 ; carmona et al .  2014 ) .",
    "such different gas and dust distributions in transitional disks suggest that , besides gas dynamics , dust particle dynamics is also important during the process of disk clearing .",
    "there are two major clearing processes proposed : gap opening by planets and disk photoevaporation ( see the reviews by kley & nelson 2012 ; baruteau et al .",
    "2013 ; alexander et al .",
    "2013 ) . in the gap opening by planets scenario ,",
    "gas can flow across the gap from the outer disk to the inner disk due to the gravitational force from the planet , explaining the high accretion rates of some transitional disks , while particles will be trapped at the outer edge of the gap due to the aerodynamic gas drag ( the `` dust filtration '' process , rice et al .",
    "2006 ; zhu et al .  2012 ; pinilla et al .",
    "thus , the dust at the inner disk is more depleted than the gas , which seems to be consistent with transitional disk observations .",
    "some transitional disks also show non - axisymmetric dust distributions at outer disks , revealed by recent alma observations ( casassus et al .",
    "2013 ; van der marel et al .  2013 ; isella et al .",
    "2013 ) . in the extreme case of oph irs 48",
    ", there is a highly asymmetric crescent - shaped dust structure between 45 and 80 au from the star .",
    "the peak emission from this dust structure is at least 130 times stronger than the upper limit of the opposite side of the disk .     to explain these non - axisymmetric dust structure in transitional disks , particle trapping by vortices",
    "is proposed .",
    "anticyclonic vortices are long lived and can efficiently trap dust particles ( barge & sommeria 1995 ; adams & watkins 1995 ; tanga et al .  1996 ; bracco et al .",
    "1999 ; godon & livio 2000 ; lyra et al .",
    "2009ab ; johansen et al .",
    "2004 ; heng & kenyon 2010 ) .",
    "small scale turbulence can affect particle trapping in vortices ( chavanis 2000 ) and may be important to explain recent alma observations ( lyra & lin 2013 , prez et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "although vortices can be generated by various hydrodynamic instabilities in disks , in the scenario of gap opening by planets , the gap edge is subject to the rossby wave instability ( rwi ) which can naturally lead to vortex formation ( lovelace et al .",
    "1999 ; li et al .  2000",
    "; see the recent review by lovelace & romanova 2013 ) .",
    "spiral shocks excited by a planet push the disk material away from the planet , leading to gap opening .",
    "this process also piles up material at the gap edge , leading to a density bump which has a vortensity minimum and is subject to the rwi ( koller et al .",
    "2003 ; li et al .  2005 ; li et al .",
    "2009 ; yu et al .  2010",
    "; lin & papaloizou 2010 ) .",
    "recently , three - dimensional ( 3-d ) simulations ( meheut et al .  2010 ; lin 2012a , 2012b ) with different equations of state ( lin 2013 ) have been carried out to study vortex formation by the rwi .",
    "particle trapping in 3-d vortices has also been studied using 3-d hydrodynamical global simulations including dust dynamics ( meheut et al .",
    "2012 , zhu et al .",
    "2014a ) , which suggests that particles at certain sizes could have a factor of more than 100 increase in the dust surface density within the vortex .",
    "however , all previous studies on particle trapping at the gap edge or vortices use inviscid hydrodynamic models or viscous hydrodynamic models as an approximation to disk turbulence . in this work ,",
    "we carry out direct mhd turbulent simulations to study particle trapping at the gap edge and vortices with a planet in a turbulent disk .",
    "our simulations have two new aspects compared with previous work .",
    "first , we have considered dust particle dynamics in global turbulent gas disks .",
    "dust particle distribution sensitively depends on gas distribution due to the gas drag .",
    "for example , an extremely shallow gap ( e.g. , @xmath5 perturbation to the disk surface density ) opened by a low mass planet ( e.g. , 10 @xmath6 ) can trap particles at the gap edge efficiently ( zhu et al .",
    "2014a ) . in mhd simulations ,",
    "turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ( mri , balbus & hawley 1991 ) can also lead to significant particle concentration ( johansen et al .",
    "although previous mhd simulations , which study gap opening by planets without including dust particles , have not reported strong gap edge vortices ( winters et al .",
    "2003 ; nelson & papaloizou 2003 ; papaloizou et al .",
    "2004 ; uribe et al . 2011 ; zhu et al .  2013 ; gressel et al .",
    "2013 ) , it is unclear if a weak vortex exists at the gap edge and be capable of trapping dust particles .",
    "second , we have considered the non - ideal mhd effect ",
    "ambipolar diffusion  in our global mhd simulations .",
    "transitional disks have wide gaps at 10s of au , where ambipolar diffusion ( ad , blaes & balbus 1994 ; mac low et al .",
    "1995 ; hawley & stone 1998 ; kunz & balbus 2004 ) should be the dominant non - ideal mhd effect ( bai 2011a , 2011b ; perez - becker & chiang 2011a , 2011b ; armitage et al .  2011 ; turner et al .",
    "ad can significantly suppress turbulence led by the mri ( brandenburg et al .",
    "1995 ; bai & stone 2011 ) . by using viscosity to approximate mri turbulence ,",
    "viscous hydrodynamical simulations have suggested that vortices can be generated at the gap edge only when the kinematic viscosity is small ( e.g. , @xmath7 , de val - borro et al .",
    "2007 ; fu et al .  2014 ) .",
    "it is unclear if mhd turbulence has similar effects on vortex formation as the viscous approximation , and if ad in a realistic protoplanetary disk can lead to enough suppression of disk turbulence to facilitate vortex formation at the gap edge .",
    "we will introduce our numerical method in  2 .",
    "our results are presented in  3 . after a short discussion in  4",
    ", we will conclude in  5 .",
    "to study gap opening by planets in disks where turbulence is already fully developed , we restart the global mhd simulations in zhu et al .",
    "( 2014b ) , but with a 9 @xmath1 planet in a circular keplerian orbit at @xmath8 .",
    "we then continue the simulations for another 100 orbits . in one case where a gap edge vortex is present",
    ", we continue the simulation until the vortex disappears around 2000 orbits , as will be discussed in  4.1 .",
    "since we wish to compare 3-d mhd simulations with two - dimensional ( 2-d ) viscous hydrodynamical ( hd ) simulations in 3-d , we use unstratified disks for 3-d mhd simulations in which the vertical component of gravity is zero .",
    "we also set the planet potential to be the potential of a line mass ( symmetric in the @xmath9 direction ) .",
    "this geometry is identical to the symmetry of 2d hd simulations , but allows mhd turbulence to be modeled in full 3d . to avoid small time steps associated with the divergence of a point source potential ,",
    "the planet potential is smoothed with a smoothing length of 0.18 , which is close to the hill radius of the planet .",
    "the detailed form of the smoothed planet potential can be found in zhu et al .",
    "furthermore , in order to avoid strong disturbance if we suddenly initialize the planet in the disk , we linearly ramp up the amplitude of the planet potential in 10 orbits .",
    "the setup of the global mhd simulations is given in detail in zhu et al .",
    "( 2014b ) .",
    "here we provide a short summary .",
    "the gas dynamics is computed with athena ( stone et al .",
    "2008 ) , a higher - order godunov scheme for hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics using constrained transport to conserve the divergence - free property for magnetic fields ( gardiner & stone 2005 , 2008 ) .",
    "cylindrical grids ( skinner & ostriker 2010 ) and the particle integrator ( bai & stone 2010 ; zhu et al .",
    "2014a ) are used to study the motion of dust particles in global mri turbulent disks .",
    "dust particles are implemented as lagrangian particles with the dust - gas drag term , following @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the velocity vectors for particle @xmath13 and the gas , @xmath14 is the gravitational force experienced by particle @xmath13 , and @xmath15 is the stopping time due to gas drag .",
    "different from the setup for gas , we include the vertical gravitational force for dust particles , in which case dust is allowed to settle toward the disk midplane . the unstratified disk setup without including the vertical gravity is a good approximation for simulating the gas dynamics at the disk midplane ( e.g. within half the gas scale height in the disk , @xmath16 ) , since the vertical gravity is much smaller than the gas pressure there .",
    "however , even close to the disk midplane , dust can have a significant stratification since it can have a much smaller scale height than the gas due to vertical settling .",
    "the initial radial profile of the gas disk in zhu et al .",
    "( 2014b ) is @xmath17 we choose @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the disk is locally isothermal at each @xmath21 , which is a good approximation in the outer disk ( beyond 10s of au ) where the study focused .",
    "when we restart the simulation at 100 orbits ( where the orbit is defined as the orbital time at @xmath8 , or @xmath22 ) , the surface density of the gas disk is not much different from this initial condition since 100 orbits is much shorter than the viscous timescale .",
    "turbulence is driven by the mri in both ideal and non - ideal mhd with ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) .",
    "following bai & stone ( 2011 ) , we include the effect of ad by modifying the induction equation as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the magnetic field , @xmath25 is the component of the current density that is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field , and @xmath26 is the ambipolar diffusivity which depends on the disk ionization ratio .",
    "we choose @xmath26 to be equal to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the alfven speed .",
    "this @xmath26 is typical for the protoplanetary disk at 10s of au ( bai 2011a ) .    for ideal mhd runs ,",
    "the disk is threaded by either net vertical or net toroidal magnetic fields . for ad runs , we only study disks threaded by net vertical fields since net toroidal fields generate little turbulence in disks dominated by ad .",
    "the initial magnetic fields have a constant plasma @xmath29 everywhere in the whole disk .",
    "the initial configuration of magnetic fields is shown in table 1 .",
    "ideal mhd runs with net vertical and toroidal fields have names starting with `` v '' and `` t '' respectively , while ad runs start with `` ad '' . for each magnetic field geometry , we have varied the initial plasma @xmath30 by at least one order of magnitude trying to extend our parameter space of the turbulent stresses .",

    "the most prominent asymmetric feature is the gap edge vortex in the mhd simulations where ad dominates or in the viscous hd simulations where the viscosity is low . in ideal mhd runs , turbulence is so strong ( the equivalent @xmath0 ) that the vortex can not form at the gap edge . with ad , turbulence is significantly suppressed ( @xmath2 ) , and the vortex forms at the gap edge . similarly in corresponding hd runs , the vortex only forms when the viscosity is small ( hd0016 and hd0002 ) . for runs with a vortex at the gap edge ,",
    "the vortex is more elongated in mhd runs that have stronger turbulence ( ad1e3 ) or in hd runs with a larger viscosity ( hd0016 ) .",
    "overall , in mri turbulent disks , the vortex is only generated when turbulence is weak , and the similarity between mhd runs and viscous hd runs implies that , in future , we may use hd simulations with viscous approximation to study the production of gap edge vortices in turbulent protoplanetary disks .",
    "another asymmetric gas feature is the `` c '' shaped horseshoe region within the gap .",
    "this region is more prominent in mhd runs with less turbulence or in hd runs with lower viscosities .",
    "this trend can be explained by the gap opening theory including non - linear wave propagation ( goodman & rafikov 2001 ) , which states that density wakes excited by the planet propagate and shock in disks , and two gaps are opened at the shocking distance on both sides of the planet . stronger turbulence or a higher viscosity depletes the horseshoe region into these two gaps by viscous diffusion , leaving a less prominent `` c '' shaped horseshoe region .",
    "one noticeable difference at the horseshoe region between mhd and hd runs is that the horseshoe region still exists even in highly turbulent ideal mhd runs , while it disappears in the corresponding viscous runs . in ideal mhd runs ,",
    "the horseshoe region is also more prominent in disks threaded by net toroidal fields ( t1e2 and t1e3 ) than in disks threaded by net vertical fields ( v1e4 and v1e5 ) , suggesting that the magnetic field geometry affects the gap opening process .",
    "this is consistent with gap opening studies using mhd shearing box simulations ( zhu et al .",
    "2013 ) , which found that the corotation region of mhd disks threaded by net vertical fields is more depleted than those threaded by net toroidal fields .",
    "the gap edge also appears eccentric due to the presence of the large vortex there .",
    "this is more clearly shown in figure [ fig : rphi ] .",
    "the gap edges can be fit with ellipses having eccentricities of 0.1 - 0.2 ( red dotted curves ) .",
    "more discussion on the shape of the gap edge is given in  4.2 .",
    "the spiral wakes look different between mhd and hd runs .",
    "the spiral wakes excited by the planet can be disrupted by turbulence in mhd runs , especially in runs where the turbulence is strong ( e.g. , ideal mhd runs ) or in regions where the wakes are weak ( e.g. , at large r ) , while the spiral wakes are always smooth and continuous in viscous hd runs .",
    "figure [ fig : oned ] shows the vertically and azimuthally averaged disk surface density for both gas and dust at the end of all our runs .",
    "particles are trapped at the gap edge ( @xmath79 ) and the horseshoe region ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the smallest particles ( par .",
    "a ) couple with gas very well and their density only increases slightly at the gap edge . with increasing particle size , trapping at the gap edge",
    "is more apparent .",
    "the maximum dust concentration at the gap edge occurs for particles with @xmath64 ( e.g. , par .",

    "the surface density variation in the @xmath43 direction is less than a factor of 2 .     in ad runs",
    ", the gap edge vortex leads to a moderate surface density variation for the gas , but a dramatic increase of the dust surface density within the vortex .",

    "d in hd023 and hd016 have a relatively flat distribution at the gap edge , while they have large variations in the corresponding ideal mhd runs .",
    "this again suggests that the distribution of particles with @xmath64 in mri turbulent disks is affected by transient turbulent fluctuations .",
    "the longer the vortex persists , the higher chance it has of being observed . to see if the gap edge vortex persists for much longer than 100 orbits , we repeat our mhd simulation ad1e3 but run it up to 2000 orbits ( denoted as ad1e3l ) . to expedite the calculation , we do not include dust particles . for comparison ,",
    "we have also carried out the corresponding hd simulation for 2000 orbits that uses viscosity to approximate turbulence ( hd001l ) .     the resulting disk surface density at 1000 and 2000 orbits is shown in figure [ fig : imagegaslong ] , which demonstrates that the gap edge vortex can persist for 1000 orbits ( left panels ) in both mhd simulations and viscous hd simulations .",
    "there are some subtle differences between mhd and hd runs , that is the vortex in the mhd simulation is as strong as it was at 100 orbits but the vortex in the viscous run becomes significantly weaker with time .",
    "however , at 2000 orbits ( middle panels ) , the gap edge vortex disappears in both cases . to make sure that there are no weak vortices at 2000 orbits that can concentrate dust particles , we inject dust particles in the turbulent disk at 2000 orbits , continue running the simulation for 20 orbits , and confirm that dust distribution is quite axisymmetric at the end of the simulation .       due to the existence of the large vortex at the gap edge ( figures [ fig : imagegas2 ] and [ fig : rphi ] )",

    "we can roughly fit the gap edge with an ellipse .",

    "the fitted ellipse for ad1e3l ( figure [ fig : imagegaslong ] ) has an eccentricity of 0.2 .",
    "we want to emphasize that the gap edge appears eccentric only due to the presence of the vortex .",
    "fluid elements at the gap edge do not necessarily move along eccentric streamlines , in contrast to motion in eccentric disks that are dynamically excited under certain disk conditions by eccentric lindblad resonances ( lubow 1991 , kley & dirksen 2006 ) .",
    "the eccentric gap edge precesses at very different rates in these two cases .",
    "the vortex orbits around the central star at the local keplerian speed ( zhu et al .",

    "then by assuming the total dust to gas mass ratio of 1:30 and the gas surface density of @xmath95 g @xmath96 , we can scale our simulation to derive the surface density of dust in each size bin for oph irs 48 .    to translate the surface density to intensity , we need to know the opacity for dust in each size bin .",
    "we use mie theory to calculate the dust opacity at 750 ghz ( 400 @xmath97 m ) for grains with the radii of 3 , 10 , 30 , 100 , 300 @xmath61 m .",

    "finally , we multiply the surface density of dust in each size bin with the corresponding opacity and add these products together to derive the total optical depth of the disk . with the total optical depth , the temperature distribution of @xmath101  k , the distance of 180 pc , 50@xmath102 inclination , and the alma beam size of 0.32``@xmath320.21 '' , we can synthesize alma observations for oph irs 48 based on dust distribution in our simulation .",
    "the synthetic images are shown in the upper panels of figure [ fig : alma ] .",
    "the left panel is the intensity before convolving with the radio beam .",
    "the middle panel is after convolution with the alma beam size of 0.32``@xmath320.21 '' , which can be directly compared with figure 1 of van der marel et al .",
    "the only difference is that the peak intensity is half of alma observations by van der marel et al .",

    "again , we make predictions for alma cycle 2 observations with a beam size of 0.16``@xmath320.11 '' , which shows a narrower rim and possibly some emission from the horseshoe region along the planet s orbit .",
    "the synthetic image suggests that alma cycle 2 observations will start to resolve the vortex structure in hd 142527 .",
    "if the non - axisymmetric density feature revealed by recent alma observations is due to the gap edge vortex , it may indicate that the protoplanetary disk beyond 10s of au is indeed dominated by ad , as suggested by disk ionization calculations ( bai et al .  2011a , 2011b , perez - becker & chiang 2011a , 2011b ) .",
    "the vortex has a significant radial extent ( @xmath105 1 at @xmath84 for par .",
    "b in figure [ fig : imagegaspar ] , compared with @xmath85 at @xmath84 ) , and the presence of the vortex also makes the gap edge appear eccentric . the vortex can exist over 1000 orbits , which is 2.5@xmath3210@xmath106 years at 40 au . this timescale is comparable to the lifetime of protoplanetary disks , and thus consistent with observations . with a different planet mass , @xmath107 , or some other conditions ,",
    "the vortex may be able to survive for even longer ( fu et al .",
    "2014 ) .     on the other hand , the vortex can not last forever , and in the case we explored in figure [ fig : imagegaslong ]",
    "it disappears at 2000 orbits .",
    "thus , it is not necessary that every transitional disk should have a gap edge vortex .",
    "the planet induced gap edge could also be smooth in turbulent disks dominated by ad .",
    "the presence of the gap edge vortex may indicate that ad dominates in the outer disk , but the reverse is not necessary , that is the absence of the vortex does not suggest that ad is not dominating the outer disk dynamics .",
    "another implication of our results is that the `` c '' shaped horseshoe region could also be observable .",
    "figure [ fig : alma ] demonstrates that alma is capable of observing the material within the horseshoe region .",
    "the upper left panel in figure [ fig : imagegaslong ] shows that the horseshoe region even has a noticeable density enhancement in the gap at 1000 orbits .     besides these asymmetric features",
    ", we have also demonstrated that particles can be trapped at the planet induced gap edge in turbulent disks driven by the mri .",
    "although this particle trapping by the gap edge has been suggested previously by both analytical calculations ( rice et al .",
    "2006 ; pillina et al .",
    "2012 ) and viscous hydrodynamical simulations ( paardekooper & mellema 2004 , 2006 ; paardekooper 2007 ; fouchet et al .  2007 , 2010 ;",
    "ayliffe et al .",
    "2012 ; zhu et al .",
    "2012 ) , we demonstrate for the first time that it can occur in realistic protoplanetary disks with turbulence driven by the mri .     we also confirm in our mhd simulations that the gap can be wider for particles having @xmath81 closer to 1 .",
    "this suggests that observations at different wavelengths ( e.g. , near - ir , mid - ir , submm , mm , or cm ) may find gaps having different radial extents . in the outer part of a protoplanetary disk ( e.g. , @xmath3 50 au ) where @xmath108 1 or 10 g @xmath96 , 1 cm particles have @xmath861 or 0.1 from equation ( [ eq : ts ] ) .",
    "thus , submm and cm observations may suggest wider gaps than observations at other wavelengths ( e.g. , near - ir ) suggest .",
    "finally , we want to caution that there has not been any firm observational evidence that planets are present in transitional disks although candidates exist ( kraus and ireland 2012 , huelamo et al .",
    "2011 , and cieza et al .",
    "photoevaporation is another proposed mechanism to open gaps and holes in transitional disks ( see the review by alexander et al .",
    "if gas can pile up at the gap edge in the photoevaporation scenario , the gap edge is also subject to the rwi and leads to the formation of a vortex .",
    "however , unlike gap opening by planets ( where the planet pushes disk material to the gap edge ) , the photoevaporation wind removes disk mass directly . building a density bump or vortensity",
    "minimum may require mass to return to the disk , or some thermodynamical processes ( e , g , `` thermal sweeping '' , owen et al .",
    "2013 ; `` photoelectric instability '' , lyra & kuchner 2013 ) that can lead to vortex formation .",
    "the main caveat in this study is the neglect of disk stratification , the hall effect , and dust feedback .",
    "when the disk is threaded by net vertical fields , local stratified simulations suggest that the stratification does not affect the turbulent level at the midplane of the ad dominated disk ( simon et al .",
    "however , strong disk winds are developed ( bai 2013 , simon et al .",
    "it remains to be explored if these winds still develop in global stratified disks and can affect vortex formation . in reality",
    ", the disk could also have layered structure .",
    "if the active layer can transport material fast enough , it may also prevent vortex generation ( lin 2014 ) . recently global mhd layered disk simulations ( gressel et al .",
    "2013 ) to study gap opening at 5 au do not report the appearance of vortices at gap edges .",
    "the hall effect is small at 100 au , but it could be important at 10 au ( lesur et al .",
    "2014 , bai 2014 ) . since the hall effect can only be studied properly in stratified disks ( kunz & lesur 2013 ) , carrying out global stratified simulations with the hall effect",
    "is needed to study the gap edge vortex at 10 au .",
    "our ad1e3 simulation suggests that , at the vortex center , the surface density of dust par .",
    "c ( @xmath109 ) is 0.1 times the gas surface density assuming the dust - to - gas mass ratio is 1:100 . using @xmath110 and @xmath111 for this run ( zhu et al .",
    "2014b ) , the scale height of par .",
    "c is 0.05 of the gas scale height .",
    "thus , at the disk midplane , the density ratio between dust and gas can reach to 2 if all dust has this size .",
    "both 2-d and 3-d unstratified simulations suggest that dust feedback can destroy the vortex when the dust - to - gas mass ratio is large ( johansen et al .",
    "2004 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is unclear how a large amount of dust at the disk midplane can affect the dynamics of the vortex which extends through the whole disk from the midplane to the atmosphere .",
    "future 3-d stratified simulations with dust feedback are desired .",
    "although the gas disk is gravitationally stable ( toomre q for the gas at 60 au in oph irs 48 is @xmath3 4000 ) , the gas / dust two fluid system could be subject to gravitational instability ( jog & solomon 1984 ) , which requires more complicated simulations including self - gravity of dust particles .",
    "the generation of a vortex at the gap edge depends on both planet and disk properties , and a thorough parameter study is desired in future .",
    "the operation of the rwi requires the disk to have a vortensity minimum , or in other words , a density bump at the gap edge .",
    "the planet pushes material to the gap edge leading to a density bump , while the viscosity or turbulent diffusion tries to smooth out the density bump .",
    "the balance between these two processes determines whether the gap edge is unstable to the rwi .",
    "the history of the planet growth is also important . in our simulations ,",
    "the planet is inserted in 10 orbits , while , in reality , the planet grows much slower .",
    "it is unclear if the vortex can still be generated if the planet growth timescale is longer than the viscous timescale .",
    "thus , carrying out a parameter study on both planet and disk properties is important to understand the vortex formation at the gap edge in a realistic protoplanetary disk .",
    "finally we caution that the similarity between mhd and viscous simulations is limited to whether the vortex can be generated at the gap edge under a given stress .",
    "this only implies that the density bump at the gap edge is smoothed by a strong turbulence or a large viscosity .",
    "the structure and the longevity of the vortex can be quite different between mhd and viscous simulations , as shown in figure [ fig : imagegaslong ] .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of particle trapping at the edge of a gap opened by a planet in a protoplanetary disk . in particular , we study the effects of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) on particle trapping .",
    "we have carried out the first global 3-d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations including lagrangian dust particles . to study gap opening in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks",
    ", we also have included ambipolar diffusion in our mhd simulations .",
    "our work demonstrates that particles are trapped at the planet induced gap edge in mri turbulent disks .",
    "the gap size is different for different particles , with the largest gap size for @xmath64 particles .    with ideal mhd",
    ", strong turbulence can lead to non - axisymmetric density features at the planet induced gap edge for particles with @xmath112 .",
    "however , the strong turbulence in these cases also prevents vortex formation at the gap edge , and particles with @xmath113 are distributed in an axisymmetric fashion .",
    "when ad is considered , turbulence is significantly suppressed ( @xmath2 ) , and the vortex forms at the planet induced gap edge . the vortex can efficiently trap dust particles that span 3 orders of magnitude in size within 100 planetary orbits , producing more than a factor of 10 enhancement in the surface density within the vortex .",
    "the existence of the vortex also makes the gap edge appear eccentric , with eccentricities up to 0.2 .",
    "the vortex in our mhd simulations with ad lasts for @xmath3 1000 orbits , which is 2.5@xmath3210@xmath106 years at 40 au , comparable to the protoplanetary disk life time .",
    "we have also carried out 2-d hd simulations using viscosity to approximate turbulence driven by the mri .",
    "we find that 2-d viscous hd simulations can reproduce vortex generation in 3-d mhd simulations very well .",
