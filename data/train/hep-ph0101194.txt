    "the hadronic matrix elements of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) currents play a basic role in the understanding of electroweak processes at the low  energy regime ( typically @xmath7 ) .",
    "however our poor knowledge of the qcd dynamics at these energies introduces annoying and serious incertitudes in the description and prediction of the processes involved .    to bypass this problem several procedures",
    "have been addressed in the literature on this topic .",
    "on one side there is a widespread set of models that pretend to describe , in a simplified way , the involved dynamics @xcite . while of importance to get a feeling of the entangled physics , the included simplifying assumptions are usually poorly justified and , sometimes , even inconsistent with qcd .",
    "ad hoc parameterizations of the matrix elements have also been extensively used @xcite .",
    "the problem with this technique is that , while the description of data can be properly accounted for , it is not easy to work out the physics hidden in the parameters .    a more promising and model ",
    "independent procedure is the use of effective actions from qcd . at very low energies ( @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the mass of the @xmath1 resonance )",
    "the most important qcd feature is its chiral symmetry that is realized in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath10pt ) @xcite , a perturbative quantum field theory that provides the effective action of qcd in terms of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "@xmath10pt has a long and successful set of predictions both in strong and electroweak processes @xcite . at higher energies ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "resonance chiral theory is the analogous framework @xcite where the lightest resonance fields are kept as explicit degrees of freedom . with the addition of dynamical constraints coming from short  distance qcd ,",
    "resonance chiral theory becomes a predictive model  independent approach to work with .",
    "one of the simplest hadronic matrix elements of a qcd current is the vector pion form factor @xmath12 defined through , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the third component of the vector current associated with the approximate @xmath16 flavour symmetry of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "the vector pion form factor drives the hadronic part of both @xmath17 and @xmath18 processes in the isospin limit .",
    "annihilation and tau decays .",
    "] there is an extensive bibliography on the study of this form factor that we do not review in detail here .    at very low energies ,",
    "@xmath12 has been calculated in @xmath10pt up to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "a successful study at the @xmath1 energy scale has been carried out in the framework of the resonance chiral theory ( the effective action of qcd at the resonance region ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this last reference the unitarity and analyticity properties of the vector pion form factor were implemented in order to match the low  energy result at @xmath20 in @xmath10pt with the correct behaviour at the @xmath1 peak .",
    "the result is in excellent agreement with the data coming from @xmath17 and @xmath21 processes .",
    "this solution , that includes the @xmath1 contribution only , leaves just one free parameter , @xmath9 , and provides a suitable description of @xmath12 up to @xmath22 .",
    "if we want to be able to extend its validity at higher energies we should take into account other contributions . to achieve this feature , the analyticity and unitarity properties of @xmath12 , together with the resonance chiral theory , continue to provide a model  independent solution for the vector pion form factor that we analyse , in detail , in this article .",
    "the new solution includes two , a priori , unknown parameters in addition to @xmath9 .",
    "these parameters happen to be related to the chiral low ",
    "energy observables in ref .",
    "@xcite , the squared charged pion radius , @xmath23 , and the @xmath24 term in the chiral expansion @xmath25 .    in the next section",
    "we construct the vector pion form factor on grounds of its analyticity and unitarity relations . in section 3",
    "we study the experimental data on @xmath3 with our solution for the pion form factor . by a fitting procedure",
    "we determine the values of @xmath9 and low  energy parameters that tau decay data demand .",
    "section 4 is devoted to analyse the results we have got from the fitting procedure and the consequences on the chiral observables of @xmath10pt .",
    "a corresponding evaluation of the two  pion contribution to the hadronic part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the fine structure constant is collected in section 5 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the vector pion form factor @xmath12 is an analytic function in the whole complex s  plane , but for the cut along the positive real axis , starting at the lowest threshold @xmath26 , where its imaginary part develops a discontinuity .",
    "this is given by the unitarity condition @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents on  shell intermediate states and @xmath29 is the scattering operator connecting the intermediate state @xmath28 to the final two  pion state .",
    "the first allowed intermediate states are @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . to every intermediate state",
    "corresponds a branch point at the value of @xmath33 equal to the squared sum of masses of the corresponding particles , i.e. @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and so on . in the elastic region , @xmath36 , the only intermediate state considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq : unit ] ) is the one with @xmath30 , and watson final  state theorem @xcite relates the imaginary part of @xmath12 to the partial wave amplitude @xmath37 for @xmath38 elastic scattering with angular momentum and isospin equal to one .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : unit ] ) , @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "as @xmath41 is a real quantity , the phase of @xmath12 must be @xmath42 , that is , the phase  shift of the @xmath37 partial wave amplitude .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 the analyticity and unitarity properties of @xmath12 are accomplished by demanding that the form factor should satisfy a n  subtracted dispersion relation in the form @xmath44 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq : unit3 ] ) .",
    "this integral equation has the known omns solution @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 strictly speaking the solution ( [ eq : omsol ] ) for @xmath12 is valid only below the inelastic threshold @xmath47 .",
    "this is because we have only included the two  pion threshold in the unitarity relation ( [ eq : unit ] ) .",
    "however , the contributions from higher multiplicity intermediate states are suppressed by phase space and ordinary chiral counting .    as in any subtracted dispersion relation like the one given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : drpf ] ) there is an interplay between the subtraction constants ( polynomial part ) and the dispersive integral . by increasing the number of subtractions ( correspondingly increasing the power of @xmath48 in the denominator ) we pull in the low  energy part of @xmath49 in the integrand .",
    "then the values of @xmath49 in the upper part of the integration are less important . at the same time the information of this high energy region shifts to the increasing number of subtraction constants that are related with the low  energy expansion of the form factor .",
    "this situation is reflected in the solution of the integral equation ( [ eq : omsol ] ) .",
    "if we know the @xmath42 phase  shift only at very low energies , an accurate evaluation of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omsol ] ) would require a high number of subtractions .",
    "this exchange of information between high and low energies is , by no means , paradoxical .",
    "it is a strict consequence of the fact that , being an analytic function in the complex s  plane , the behaviour of @xmath12 at different energy scales is related .",
    "dispersion relations embody rigorously this property .",
    "the @xmath42 phase ",
    "shift is rather well known , experimentally , up to @xmath50 .",
    "resonance chiral theory provides a model  independent analytic expression that describes properly the @xmath1 contribution @xcite to it  : @xmath51 with @xmath52 the hadronic off ",
    "shell @xmath53 width @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : apb2 ] ) in the appendix ) .",
    "this result , that provides our definition of @xmath9 , follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : unit3 ] ) and the expression for @xmath12 obtained in ref",
    ".  @xcite that we collect in appendix a. the description of data given by @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d11rc ] ) is accurate enough up to @xmath7 for values of @xmath9 in the ballpark of the average value collected in the review of particle properties @xcite . at higher energies heavier resonances with the same quantum numbers pop up and to get a correct description we should use the available experimental data from ochs @xcite .",
    "we will take the result for @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omsol ] ) with 3 subtractions .",
    "there are several reasons to take this case .",
    "on one side the number of subtractions is high enough to weight the low  energy behaviour of @xmath42 that is much well known than its high energy part . on the other side",
    "the number of subtraction constants , three a priori unknown parameters , is low enough to allow a reasonable parameterization .",
    "in fact one of the subtraction constants is provided by the normalization condition on the form factor , i.e. @xmath54 , and there remain two parameters that can be related to the low  energy expansion of the form factor , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , as we will shortly see .",
    "therefore we take as the vector pion form factor provided by analyticity and unitarity the expression @xmath57 since eq .",
    "( [ eq : unit3 ] ) is only valid in the elastic region , we have introduced an upper cut in the integration , @xmath58 .",
    "this cut  off has to be taken high enough not to spoil the , a priori , infinite interval of integration , but low enough that the integrand is well known in the interval . as commented above we know",
    "best @xmath42 up to @xmath59",
    ". we will take @xmath60 though , with three subtractions , there is a negligible difference ( within the errors ) between @xmath61 and the previous value .",
    "the two subtraction constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 are related with the squared charge radius of the pion @xmath55 and the quadratic term @xmath56 in the low  energy expansion of the pion form factor @xmath64 through the relations @xmath65 that follow from the expansion of the form factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3sub ] ) and its comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq : chir ] ) . we will use them to predict these observables .",
    "the fact that @xmath12 is dominated by the @xmath1 vector meson up to @xmath7 has been extensively used to get the properties of this resonance . in order to proceed , a breit ",
    "wigner  like form factor is usually introduced and fitted to the data .",
    "this procedure , however , relies in a modelization of the form factor that is not necessarily consistent with qcd .",
    "here we propose a thorough model ",
    "independent determination of the mass of the @xmath1 resonance , @xmath9 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : d11rc ] ) .",
    "@xmath12 endows the hadronic dynamics in the @xmath67 decay and the @xmath17 process .",
    "the experimental data from this last source @xcite has been available for long time and deeply analysed .",
    "the decay @xmath3 has recently been measured accurately , in the energy region of our interest , by three experimental groups  : aleph @xcite , cleo ",
    "ii @xcite and opal @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath12 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:3sub ] ) , to fit the aleph set of data .",
    "an appropriate study of the form factor requires a proper description of the @xmath42 phase  shift in the integration interval . as we are working with 3 subtractions the main contribution to the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3sub ] ) comes from the low  energy region of the phase  shift .",
    "however if we wish to consider @xmath12 around @xmath68 the cut  off @xmath58 should be not lower than , let us say , @xmath69 , as we commented previously .",
    "therefore we require a precise description of @xmath42 in this energy region .",
    "we achieve this through the following procedure  : @xmath42 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : d11rc ] ) provides an implementation up to @xmath70 ; hence for @xmath71 ( higher values of @xmath72 being unimportant because the three subtractions performed ) we include the ochs set of data @xcite . as a result",
    "we come out with a description of @xmath42 , in the region of interest , that contains all the necessary physics input .",
    "however there are still contributions to the form factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3sub ] ) that are not taken into account with ochs data .",
    "these are those of coupled channels that open at the @xmath32 threshold @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to have a conservative determination of the observables , we choose to fit aleph data in the range @xmath73 where we have a thorough control of the contributions .",
    "the fitting procedure is carried out with the minuit package @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath74 though the @xmath75 value found can be considered reasonable it is necessary to notice that @xmath76 of @xmath77 comes from just three points . and the other two around @xmath78 . ] errors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : res2 ] ) , given by the minuit program , are to be taken with care .",
    "they do not include those that come from the choices we have made in our approach : the energy range to be fitted , number of subtractions , upper cut of integration @xmath58 and the matching point , @xmath79 , between ochs data and eq .",
    "( [ eq : d11rc ] ) .",
    "we estimate the final errors by exploring the stability of the results with two and four subtractions , varying the cut ",
    "off from @xmath61 to @xmath60 , extending the fitted energy range up to @xmath80 and shifting @xmath79 within the ochs data errors .",
    "hence we conclude the figures @xmath81 the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 turn out to be highly anti  correlated .",
    "this procedure provides a mass for the @xmath1 resonance roughly 5 standard deviations higher than the particle data group new average @xcite that is @xmath82 but consistent with their average from @xmath66 decays and @xmath83 processes , @xmath84 .    in fig .",
    "1 we compare the experimental data with our prescription .",
    "we also include the parameter  free prediction ( 1 subtraction only ) of ref .",
    "@xcite that , for completeness , we recall in appendix a. it can be seen that our fit gives a good description of data up to @xmath85 .",
    "experimental data ( in spite of the big errors in the higher energy region ) seem to have a determinate structure ( mild shoulder ) around @xmath85",
    ". this could be due to a heavier @xmath53like resonance as the @xmath86 .",
    "our solution takes into account this possibility though , because ochs data embody these resonances up to @xmath87 .    we can compare the results of our fit to tau decay data with the experimental results coming from @xmath17 ( time  like ) @xcite and @xmath88 ( space  like ) @xcite processes . in fig",
    "2 we show these sets of data together with the same curves of fig .",
    "we conclude that the agreement of our fit with data is good within the errors .",
    "notice that @xmath17 data has a contribution from @xmath89 that translates into a slight deformation on the right  hand side of the @xmath1 peak .",
    "this is due to a small @xmath90 component contributing to the @xmath30 spectral function in @xmath17 .",
    "this contribution does not appear in the isovector spectral function from @xmath91 which we are describing .",
    "at @xmath92 the vector pion form factor satisfies a low  energy expansion given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : chir ] ) . up to the quadratic term in @xmath33 we have ,",
    "therefore , two low  energy observables , the squared charge radius of the pion , @xmath55 , and the quadratic term @xmath56 , that are related with the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the form factor ( [ eq:3sub ] ) as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : compar ] ) .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 have recently been determined at @xmath19 in @xmath10pt @xcite . while chiral symmetry constraints successfully provide the chiral logarithms",

    "our procedure provides the low  energy observables from a fit to a larger energy interval in the time  like region . in table 1",
    "we compare our figures with those of ref .  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen the results compare very well but the errors to the observables provided by our procedure are smaller ( noticeably in @xmath25 ) .    ._low  energy observables of the vector pion form factor up to the quadratic term .",

    "( [ eq : res2fi ] ) was limited to @xmath97 .",
    "as commented there we took this region because we have a thorough control of the physics involved within . at higher energies new physics input , unaccounted for , appears . as a result , in fig .",
    "1 it can be seen that our fit misses barely the data above @xmath98 , well outside the fitted region .",
    "the computation of the integrals in @xmath95 ( [ eq : amfv ] ) and @xmath96 ( [ eq : delal ] ) requires a good knowledge of @xmath12 up to @xmath99 , therefore if we wish to reach @xmath100 we would need a better description of data than the one given with the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : res2fi ] ) . to achieve this feature we fix @xmath101 , as concluded in eq .",
    "( [ eq : res2fi ] ) , and leave @xmath62 , @xmath63 as free parameters",

    "the tildes on @xmath62 and @xmath63 are meant to prevent their use in eq .",
    "( [ eq : compar ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath105 and @xmath106 are not proper physical values of the @xmath62 , @xmath63 parameters because we have fitted a region of experimental data that is not properly implemented theoretically .",
    "however the above values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 describe well data up to @xmath107 and , therefore , are useful to evaluate the integrals in @xmath95 and @xmath96 with smaller errors .",
    "the values we get are collected in table 3 .",
    "it has to be noticed that our errors are similar to those obtained in recent estimations @xcite , though the results in this reference were obtained from a combination of @xmath108 and @xmath3 decay data while our results come from a fit to this last process up to @xmath80 .",
    "an improvement on our errors would require an analysis of the pion vector form factor with a more complete set of data , combining @xmath108 and @xmath3 processes .",
    "to gain access to the resonance properties , from experimental data , a correct definition of those properties has to be theoretically implemented .",
