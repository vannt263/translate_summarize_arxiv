    "since dicke proposed the idea of superradiance@xcite , coherent radiation phenomena for atomic systems was intensively investigated2,3,4,5,6 .",
    "what dicke found was that when the gas is in a particular state with the half number of molecules excited , the spontaneous emission rate of the whole gas is proportional to the square of the molecular concentration , provided that the gas volume dimension is small compared to the emitted photon wavelength .",
    "one of the interests in superradiant study lies in its close connection with the physics of laser emission . in some aspect , the superradiant phenomena appears somewhat simpler since one can neglect the pumping and relaxation mechanisms which are important in laser operation and consider only the evolution of atoms exclusively coupled to their own radiation field .    in solid state physics ,",
    "the exciton - polariton state is  one of the limiting cases of superradiance . when a frenkel exciton couples to the radiation field in a small system which contains @xmath2 lattice points , it represents one excited atom and @xmath3 unexcited atoms in the others .",
    "according to dicke s theory , the decay rate of the system will be enhanced by a factor @xmath2 .",
    "but as it was well known in a 3-d bulk crystal@xcite , _ _",
    "_ _ the exciton will couple with photon to form polariton ",
    "the eigenstate of the combined system consisting of the crystal and the radiation field which does not decay radiatively .",
    "what makes the exciton trapped in the bulk crystal is the conservation of crystal momentum .",
    "if one considers a linear chain or a thin film , the radiative recombination of excitons is fundamentally different from the three - dimensional case . in bulk crystal , radiative",
    "decay requires phonons or other translational - invariance breaking entities such as defects , impurities , or interfaces .",
    "thin films or linear chains , however , inherently break translational invariance . as a consequence ,",
    "a radiative decay channel opens up , and the decay rate of the exciton is enhanced by a factor of @xmath4 in a linear chain@xcite and ( @xmath5 for 2d exciton - polariton@xcite , where @xmath6 is the wave length of emitted photon and @xmath7 is the lattice constant of the linear chain or the thin film .    with the advances of microfabrication technologies such as molecular beam epitaxy , it has become possible to fabricate various structures of microcrystals with fine quality and novel properties , such as quantum well , superlattice , quantum dot , quantum wire , and quantum ring .",
    "the exciton in a quantum well can exhibit the behavior between purely three dimensions and two dimensions .",
    "many investigations on the radiative linewidth of excitons in quantum wells have been performed @xcite . for lower dimensional systems ,",
    "first observation of superradiant short lifetimes of excitons was performed by ya .",
    "et al_.@xcite on surface states of the anthracene crystal .",
    "superradiance has also been discussed for one - dimensional ( 1d ) frenkel excitons in disordered aggregates.@xcite a. l. ivanov and h. haug@xcite predicted the existence of exciton crystal , which favors coherent emission in the form of superradiance , in quantum wires .",
    "y. manabe _",
    "et al_.@xcite considered the superradiance of interacting frenkel excitons in a linear chain . for quantum dots of cucl with radii r between 18 and 77 @xmath8 ,",
    "the superradiance of excitons was also observed by nakamura _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "the decay rate was shown to be proportional to r@xmath9 which confirms the theoretical prediction by hanamura.@xcite similar works were also obtained by itch _",
    "et al_.@xcite . by using numerical simulation , spano _",
    "et al_. @xcite have also showed the effective coherent size ( which is inversely proportional to the decay time in their definition ) decreases as the temperature increases .",
    "recently , superradiance of polaritons from a dimer to finite one - dimensional crystal has also been discussed by dubovskii.@xcite    in reality , superradiance is accompanied by frequency shift , as pointed by lee",
    "_ et al_.@xcite .",
    "however , the coherent frequency shift of an exciton has received fewer attention .",
    "one of the reasons is the difficulty arose from the divergent nature of frequency shift , both infrared and ultraviolet .",
    "et al_. @xcite have solved the problem by using the method of renormalization for a system of two atoms , and applied to the case of excitons in a thin semiconductor film.@xcite recently , we have generalized their results to the quantum well systems.@xcite the crossover behavior from 2d film to 3d crystal was also examined .",
    "it was found that both the decay rate and renormalized frequency shift show oscillatory dependence on layer thickness .    on the other hand",
    ", purcell@xcite predicted that the spontaneous emission rate , and thus the relaxation lifetime of an excited atom , would be altered if the atom was put in a cavity with dimensions comparable to the transition wavelength of the atom .",
    "the reason for modified spontaneous emission rate is that spontaneous emission can be viewed as stimulated emission , stimulated by vacuum - field fluctuations .",
    "hence , the lifetime can be altered by modifying the photon density of states .    in the last few years ,",
    "experiments which have confined photons in low - dimensional semiconductor quantum structures by using optical microcavities were in progress .",
    "researche on combined quantum confined 2d carriers and 2d photon states has been performed by using quantum wells embedded in planar microcavities , yielding interesting physics both in the weak and strong carrier - photon coupling regimes.@xcite results from 2d carriers combined with 1d ( 0d ) photon states have also been studied 32,33 . introducing further degrees of carrier confinement in such microcavity structures is a natural trend in this field . recently , the incorporation of quantum dots in planar and pillar microcavities have been reported.@xcite a coupling between 1d electron state and 2d photon states were also obtained by inserting an array of quantum wires into a planar microcavity.@xcite such systems lead to dramatic changes in the exciton - polariton dispersion@xcite and exciton lifetime.@xcite    in this manuscript , an alternative way is proposed to observe the inhibited or enhanced spontaneous emission by embedding a quantum dot inside a microcavity@xcite . after the injection of an electron and hole into a quantum dot , a photon is generated by the recombination of the exciton .",
    "this process allows one to determine purcell effect by measuring the current through the quantum dot .",
    "similarly , by embedding two quantum dots inside the cavity and controlling the gate voltage of one of the dots , one can not only determine the superradiant effect by measuring the stationary current , but also induces the entangled states , which is one of the fundamental requirements for quantum information processing .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief description of superradiant and purcell effects is reviewed in section ii . in section iii , we discussed the transport properties of a two level quantum dot embedded in a planar microcavity .",
    "electrical measurements of superradiance and the generated entanglement are shown in section iv .",
    "finally , overall conclusions are presented in the last section .",

    "the vertical and horizontal units in the inset of fig .",
    "5 are 100 pa and @xmath227 , respectively . here , @xmath217 is the wavelength of the photon emitted by the quantum dot exciton in free space .",
    "once again , we observe the suppressed current as the exciton energy gap is tuned below the cut - off frequency .",
    "the plateau features in the inset of fig .",
    "5 also comes from the abruptly opened decay channels for the quantum dot exciton . from the experimental point of view",
    ", it is not possible to tune either the cavity length or the energy gap for such a wide range .",
    "a possible way is to vary the exciton gap around the first discontinuous point @xmath227 . since the discontinuities should smear out for the real microcavity , it is likely to have a peak if one measures the differential conductance @xmath228 as a function of energy gap @xmath229",
    "now , we consider _ two spatially separated _ quantum dots incorporated inside the _ p - i - n _ junction .",
    "the novel feature here is the dissipative creation of entanglement over relatively large distances , and its readout via the stationary current .",
    "the device structure is shown in fig .",
    "one of the obstacles in measuring superradiance between the quantum dots comes from the random size of the dots which result in a random distribution of energy gap and thus diminishes the coherent radiation .",
    "this can be overcome by constructing a gate voltage over one of the quantum dots .",
    "the energy gap and the orientation of the dipole moments of one of the quantum dots , thus can be controlled well .",
    "after a hole is injected into the hole subband in the quantum dot , the _ n_-side electron can tunnel into the exciton level because of the coulomb interaction between the electron and hole . in our calculation , we also neglect the forster process which may have some influences on the results if the two dots are close to each other .",
    "the validity of this assumption will be discussed later .",
    "thus , we may assume four dot states @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , and @xmath233 , where @xmath234 means there is one hole in dot 1 and @xmath235 represents the ground state with no hole and electron in the quantum dots .",
    "the exciton states @xmath236 ( in dot 1 ) can be converted to @xmath237 ( in dot 2 ) through the exciton - photon interactions . by transforming @xmath238 and @xmath239 into dicke states : @xmath240 and @xmath241 , we can now define the dot - operators @xmath242 @xmath143 @xmath243 @xmath244 @xmath245",

    "the equations of motion can be expressed as    @xmath254    where the index @xmath255 or @xmath256 .",
    "similarly , the tunnel current @xmath257 can be defined as the change of the occupation of @xmath258 and is given by @xmath259 .",

    "the corresponding decay rate for superradiant and the subradiant channels is given by    @xmath265    where @xmath7 is the inter - dot distance and @xmath220 is the exciton decay rate in a quantum dot . to display the dependence of the stationary current through the quantum dot on the dot distance @xmath7 , we present the results of two identical quantum dots in fig . 7 .    .",
    "the interference effect is seen clearly ( inset ) by incorporating the system inside a rectangular microcavity .",
    "the vertical and horizontal units are 100 pa and @xmath100 , respectively.,width=283 ]    as shown in fig .",
    "7 , the current is suppressed as the dot distance @xmath7 is much smaller than the wavelength ( @xmath217 ) of the emitted photon .",
    "this corresponds to the trapping state in the two - ion system .",
    "as long as we choose only one of the dots to be coupled to reservoirs , the generated photon is reabsorbed immediately by the other dot and vice versa .",
    "the current is then blocked by this exchange process . for small rates",
    "limit ( @xmath266 ) one can approximate eq .",
    "( 4.3 ) by @xmath267^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the rates @xmath268 drop out completely and the current is only determined by the ( smaller ) radiative decay rates . in this approximate form ,",
    "the current looks identical to the expression for the conductance @xmath269^{-1}$ ] from a left lead through a single level to a right lead with tunnel rates @xmath270 .",
    "this implies that the superradiant and the subradiant channel are in series ( and not in parallel ) in this limit .",
    "this is because once the exciton is formed in dot 1 , time evolution of this state is proportional to @xmath271 not @xmath272@xcite .",
    "it means the two decay channels in our system are not in parallel . for long time behavior @xmath273 and @xmath274 , the function @xmath275 approaches the limit of @xmath276 , which is identical to the same limit of the function @xmath277(in series ) .",
    "similar to the two - ion superradiance @xcite , the current also exhibits oscillatory behavior as a function of dot distance . to observe the interference effect clearly , one may incorporate the system inside a microcavity since semiconductor cavities with strong electron - photon coupling have been realized experimentally by , e.g. , grard _",
    "_  et al__.@xcite .",
    "reduction of the allowed @xmath278-state is expected to increase the magnitude of the oscillation .",
    "for example , if the system is placed inside a rectangular microcavity with length @xmath217 , the decay rate for the two channels can be worked out straightforwardly :    @xmath279    the stationary current is plotted in the inset of fig . 7 , where a perfect ( lossless ) cavity is assumed . as we mentioned above , the amplitude of oscillation is larger than that in free space",
    ". however , the oscillation period is not half of the wavelength , but @xmath280 .",
    "this is because the interference term is only influenced by the wave vector in the unconfined direction .",
    "excluding the contributions from fundamental cavity modes , the effective wave vector can be expressed as    @xmath281    the oscillation period of the decay rate and the current is therefore increased by a factor of @xmath282 .    in fig .",
    "8 , we plot the expectation value of @xmath283 ( @xmath284 ) as a function of the dot distance .",
    "the maximum entangled state ( @xmath285 ) is reached as @xmath286 @xmath217 .",
    "this is remarkable as the steady state is independent of the initial state .",
    "the entanglement is induced by the cooperative decoherence in the system . in a recent paper by schnider _",
    "et al_.@xcite , the authors consider the behavior of an ion trap with all ions driven simultaneously and coupled collectively to a heat bath .",
    "they also found that the steady state of the ion trap can exhibit quantum entanglement .",
    "however , the concurrence of their system is below the value of unity ( maximum entanglement ) . on the contrary , in our system",
    "the maximum entangled state can be generated by tuning the band gap of dot 2 ( linear stark effect ) , i.e. control the on / off of the superradiance .",
    "another advantage of our scheme is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "if the double - dot system is incorporated inside a rectangular microcavity , the maximum entangled states repeat as a function of inter - dot distance .",
    "this means even for remote separation , the entanglement can still be achieved .",
    "the reason can be attributed to that the creation of entanglement in our model is governed by the interaction with a common heat bath @xcite , while conventional creation of entanglement depends on the direct interaction between two subsystems@xcite .",
    "when two dots are coupled to the common photon fields , the collective decay process drives the system into the entangled states .",
    "the novel feature of the effect predicted here is that entanglement in fact can be controlled electrically ( without applying a laser field ) and read out in the form of a transport property , i.e. , the electron _ current _ ( as a function of the dot distance or , alternatively , the cavity length ) .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath284 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the inset shows the results inside a rectangular microcavity.,width=283 ]    another possible application of this effect is that by tuning the coherence of the dots , one can control the emission of single photon at predetermined times , which is important for the field of quantum information technology .",
    "one might argue that for small inter - dot distance the forster process may play some role in our system@xcite ; nevertheless , this only causes small energy splitting between state @xmath287 and @xmath288 . comparing to the large energy difference in the iii - v semiconductor material ,",
    "its effect on the decay rate @xmath289 is negligible .",
    "a few remarks about the problem of dissipation should be mentioned here .",
    "the coherence of the quantum states is a fundamental issue in quantum physics and decoherence caused by phonons or imperfections may destroy the unitary quantum evolution . in our proposals ,",
    "decoherence due to interaction with other bosonic excitations ( phonons and electron - hole pairs in the leads ) is inevitable but can in principle be ( partly ) controlled by variation of the dot energies , or control of the mechanical degree of freedom@xcite .",
    "in addition , scattering due to impurities are negligible since there is no interdot transport in our system .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a new method of detecting superradiant and purcell effects in semiconductor quantum dots . by incorporating a quantum dot between a p - i - n junction , the purcell effect on stationary tunnel current",
    "can be examined by the variations of cavity length or exciton gap . for the double - dot system ,",
    "the superradiant effect on the stationary tunnel current can be examined by tuning the band gap of the quantum dot .",
    "the interference effects between two dots can be seen more clearly by incorporating the system inside a microcavity .",
    "the oscillation period of the decay rate and current is also increased because of the microcavity . moreover , the maximum entangled state is induced as the inter - dot distance is much smaller than the wavelength of the emitted photon . our model provides a new way to generate the entanglement in solid - state systems and maybe useful in future quantum information processing .",
