    "<S> we use for this purpose the truncated wigner method , which is , as we show , corresponding to the diagonal approximation of a semiclassical van vleck  gutzwiller representation of this many - body transport process . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue that semiclassical corrections beyond this diagonal approximation are vanishing under disorder average , thus confirming the validity of the truncated wigner method in this context . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations show that , while for weak atom - atom interaction strength anderson localization is preserved with a slight modification of the localization length , for larger interaction strenghts a crossover to a delocalized regime exists due to inelastic scattering . in this case , the transport is fully incoherent . </S>"
