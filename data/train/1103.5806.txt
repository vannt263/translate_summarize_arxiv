    "sec : comparison ] ) also show indications that the co gas may not be aligned with the central location of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "in particular 4c60.07 shows an apparent deficit of molecular gas in the radio host galaxy , while co appears to be present in a merging companion and associated tidal debris @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , a more detailed comparison between the co(1 - 0 ) properties of these systems deserves further attention .",
    "the position angle of the radio source in mrc  0943 - 242 ( which has a total linear size of about 4@xmath89 and is therefore unresolved in our observations ) is pa = -74@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this is roughly within 45@xmath28 of the location of the tentative co detection from the central region of the radio host galaxy .",

    "both radio sources are clearly detected in our sensitive ( @xmath90 @xmath32jy ) 7 mm continuum observations .",
    "their spectral indices are relatively steep from @xmath6030 ghz down to 1.4 ghz , with no evidence for spectral curvature within this large range of frequencies .",
    "this indicates that there is no turn - over due to synchrotron losses or inverse compton cooling up to @xmath60115 ghz in the restframe of these radio sources .",
    "this is consistent with continuum observations of a large sample of high-@xmath13 ultra - steep spectrum radio galaxies by @xcite , who also find relatively steep power law spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with no evidence for spectral steepening up to several tens of ghz in the rest frame .",
    "a detailed analysis of this phenomenon is crucial for understanding the electron acceleration mechanism or environmental properties of high-@xmath13 radio sources , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we presented the first 7 mm observations of two high-@xmath13 radio galaxies ( mrc  2104 - 242 and mrc  0943 - 242 ) with the @xmath1  ghz compact array broadband backend .",
    "our results demonstrate the feasibility of using atca / cabb for spectral - line work at high redshift .",
    "we also presented 7 mm continuum images of the two high-@xmath13 radio galaxies , with a typical rms noise level of @xmath6030 @xmath32jy beam@xmath12 .",

    "these upper limits are of the same order as h@xmath63 mass estimates derived from co detections of other high-@xmath13 radio galaxies and smgs , but lower than the mass of molecular gas detected in a non - negligible fraction of normal star forming galaxies at @xmath80 . for mrc  0943 - 242",
    "we also find a tentative co(1 - 0 ) detection at about 60 kpc distance from the central region of the host galaxy , but this needs to be confirmed with additional observations .    the spectral index of both mrc  2104 - 242 and mrc  0943 - 242 is relatively steep with @xmath9 between 1.4 and 30 ghz .",
