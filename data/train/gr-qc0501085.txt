    "in general relativity it is often difficult to interprete when an observer @xmath0 is comoving with another observer @xmath1 , in the sense that @xmath0 moves  like \" @xmath1 . for example , given a particular coordinate system it is usual to suppose that stationary observers ( i.e. with constant spatial coordinates ) are comoving each one with respect to the other . but this criterion is coordinate - dependent : let us suppose that two observers are stationary using a particular coordinate system ; then they are comoving each one with respect to the other . on the other hand",
    ", we can find another coordinate system in which one observer is stationary and the other one is not stationary ; then they are not comoving each one with respect to the other .",
    "since we want that the property  to be comoving with \" was an intrinsic property of the observer ( i.e. that an observer was able to decide if it is comoving with another observer or not , independently from the coordinate system ) , the  stationary criterion \" is a bad criterion .",
    "given an observer @xmath0 , there is a general method to check if it is comoving with another observer @xmath1 , based on the concept of simultaneity .",
    "we have to build a simultaneity foliation associated with @xmath0 @xcite , then parallelly transport the 4-velocity of @xmath1 to @xmath0 , along geodesics joining @xmath1 with @xmath0 in the leaves of the foliation , and finally compare it with the 4-velocity of @xmath2 ( see fig . [ figintro ] ) .",
    "there are a lot of kinds of simultaneities , but we are going to consider only two kinds of simultaneity foliations associated with a given observer @xmath0 @xcite : the landau foliation @xmath3 , whose leaves are landau submanifolds @xcite , also called fermi surfaces ( spacelike ) ; and the past - pointing horismos foliation @xmath4 , whose leaves are past - pointing horismos submanifolds @xcite ( lightlike ) .",
    "we have to note that if we use landau foliations , then the method to check if an observer is comoving with another one is symmetric ; on the other hand , if we use past - pointing horismos foliations , then this method is not symmetric , i.e. one observer @xmath0 can be comoving with another observer @xmath1 , and @xmath1 being non comoving with @xmath0 .",
    "but , since we are working in relativity , the non - symmetry is an acceptable property .",
    "so , the problem is to decide which simultaneity ( spacelike or lightlike ) is mathematically and physically more suitable for us :     is comoving with another observer @xmath1 , depending on the simultaneity foliation that we are using .",
    "left : landau foliation @xmath3 ( spacelike ) .",
    "right : past - pointing horismos foliation @xmath4 ( lightlike).,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    ( a ) : :    mathematically : in a previous work @xcite we proved that the landau    foliation @xmath3 is not always defined in    every convex normal neighborhood because its leaves can intersect    themselves .",
    "for example , in a minkowski space - time if the observer    @xmath0 is not geodesic .",
    "moreover ,    @xmath3 is not necessarily spacelike at    every point of a convex normal neighborhood . on the other hand ,",
    "the    past - pointing horismos foliation    @xmath4 is always well defined in every    convex normal neighborhood and it is always lightlike .",
    "( b ) : :    physically : given an observer at an event @xmath5 with    4-velocity @xmath6 , the events of its landau submanifold    @xmath7 do not affect the observer at @xmath5 in    any way , since both electromagnetic and gravitational waves travel at    the speed of light .",
    "on the other hand , the events of its past - pointing    horismos submanifold @xmath8 are precissely the events    that affect and are observed by the observer at @xmath5 , i.e.    the events that _ exist _ for the observer at @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we are going to work in the framework of lightlike simultaneity .",
    "so , given an observer at an event @xmath5 , we will say that the events of @xmath8 are _ lightlike - simultaneous _ for this observer at @xmath5 .",
    "in fact to be lightlike - simultaneous for an observer  is the same as to be observed simultaneously by an observer .",
    "hence , in section [ s3 ] , we define the _ observers congruence comoving with a given observer _ , according to the concept of lightlike simultaneity , and we give a method to measure relative velocities of observers in section [ s3.1 ] . given a light ray , we study doppler effect in section [ s3.2 ] , obtaining that the frequency of a light ray remains constant for comoving observers .",
    "this is apparently contradictory with _ gravitational redshift _ effect , stating that light rays gain or lose frequency in the presence of a gravitational field , and it is considered independent of doppler effect .",
    "gravitational redshift effect is completely explained in our formalism , showing that it is a particular case of a generalized doppler effect .",
    "we also study light aberration effect in section [ s3.3 ] , obtaining that there is not light aberration between comoving observers .",
    "the concept of distance is strongly bounded to the concept of simultaneity too .",
    "we are using lightlike simultaneity , so we have to measure distances between lightlike - simultaneous events , i.e. we need to measure lengths of light rays . in section [ s4 ] , we re - define a concept of distance ( called _ affine distance _ ) between an observer and the events that it observes , i.e. a distance between @xmath5 and the events of @xmath8 . in section [ s5 ]",
    ", we show that affine distance is a particular case of radar distance in the minkowski space - time and generalizes the proper radial distance in the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "finally , we show that affine distance gives us a new concept of distance in robertson - walker space - times , according to hubble law .",
    "we work in a 4-dimensional lorentzian space - time manifold @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 the levi - civita connection , using the landau - lifshitz spacelike convention ( llsc ) .",
    "we suppose that @xmath9 is a convex normal neighborhood @xcite .",
    "thus , given two events @xmath5 and @xmath12 in @xmath9 , there exists a unique geodesic joining @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "the parallel transport from @xmath5 to @xmath12 along this geodesic will be denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath14 is a curve with @xmath15 a real interval , we will identify @xmath0 with the image @xmath16 ( that is a subset in @xmath9 ) , in order to simplify the notation .",
    "if @xmath6 is a vector , then @xmath17 denotes the orthogonal space of @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath18 is a spacelike vector , then @xmath19 denotes the module of @xmath18 .",
    "given a pair of vectors @xmath20 , we use @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 is a vector field , @xmath24 will denote the unique vector of @xmath23 in @xmath25 .",
    "an _ observer _ in the space - time is determined by a timelike world line @xmath0 , and the events of @xmath0 are the _ positions _ of the observer .",
    "it is usual to identify an observer with its world line , and so @xmath0 is an observer .",
    "the _ 4-velocity _ of the observer is a future - pointing timelike unit vector field @xmath26 defined in @xmath0 and tangent to @xmath0 .",
    "given an event @xmath5 , the 4-velocity of an observer at @xmath5 is given by a future - pointing timelike unit vector @xmath6 .",
    "it is also usual to identify an observer with its 4-velocity , since they are defined reciprocally .",

    "we can construct horismos foliations in this way ( @xcite , @xcite ) : let @xmath0 be an observer .",

    "if @xmath6 is comoving with @xmath28 , then @xmath88 , @xmath176 and so , from ( [ abegen1 ] ) , we have @xmath177 .",
    "since @xmath178 is the way @xmath6 observes @xmath51 , we can say that @xmath6 and @xmath28 observes @xmath36 with the same  relative velocity , and hence there is not light aberration between comoving observers .",
    "to measure distances in our formalism we have to measure lengths  of light rays , as we told in the introduction .",
    "but light rays are lightlike curves and they have no length . to measure distances and angles , an observer has to project these light rays onto its physical space ( i.e. the orthogonal space of its 4-velocity ) .",
    "this idea drives us to the next definition of distance :    [ d1.dist]let @xmath36 be a light ray from @xmath12  to @xmath5 and let @xmath6 be an observer at @xmath5 .",
    "the affine distance from @xmath12 to @xmath5 observed by @xmath6 , @xmath179 , is the module of the projection of @xmath180 onto @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this concept of distance is defined according to the concept of lightlike simultaneity given by the past - pointing horismos submanifolds , because we measure distances between an event @xmath5 and the events that are observed simultaneously at @xmath5 ( i.e. events of @xmath8 ) .     of the affine distance from @xmath12 to @xmath5 observed by @xmath6 , given in definition [ d1.dist ] . in this case",
    ", @xmath12 is an event of a world line @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath179 does not depend on @xmath1.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    taking into account definition [ d1.dist ] , we have @xmath181 , where @xmath45 is the relative velocity of @xmath36 observed by @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "so , it is easy to prove that @xmath182 in the tangent space @xmath25 we have that @xmath45 and @xmath183 are proportional and opposite . taking into account definition [ d1.dist ] , we have @xmath184 . given another observer @xmath28 at @xmath5 , we have @xmath185 , where @xmath51 is the relative velocity of @xmath36 observed by @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath186 where @xmath34 is the relative velocity of @xmath28 observed by @xmath6 and @xmath30 is the gamma factor corresponding to @xmath91 .    if we compare ( [ f1.dopdist ] ) with ( [ f1.dop ] ) , we realize that frequency and affine distance have the same behaviour when a change of observer is done .",
    "hence , if @xmath36 is a light ray from @xmath12  to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath28  are two observers at @xmath5 , we have @xmath187 where @xmath41 , @xmath50 are the frequencies of @xmath36 observed by @xmath6 , @xmath28 respectively .",
    "the next proposition shows that the concept of distance given in definition [ d1.dist ] coincides with the known concept of _ affine distance _ introduced in @xcite :    [ p2.pardis ] let @xmath36 be a light ray from @xmath12 to @xmath5 , let @xmath6 be an observer at @xmath5 and let @xmath45 be the relative velocity of @xmath36 observed by @xmath6 .",
    "if we parameterize @xmath36 affinely ( i.e. @xmath188 ) such that @xmath189 , and @xmath190 , then @xmath191 ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) .    by the properties of the exponential map ( see @xcite ) , we have @xmath192 .",
    "so @xmath193 .    , where @xmath12 is an event of a world line @xmath1",
    "note that @xmath179 does not depend on @xmath1.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    hence , given a light ray @xmath36 from @xmath12 to @xmath5 and an observer @xmath6 at @xmath5 , we can interprete the affine distance from @xmath12 to @xmath5 observed by @xmath6 as the distance ( or time ) travelled by the light ray @xmath36 , measured by an observer at @xmath5 with 4-velocity @xmath6 .",
    "an equivalent result is given :    [ c2.pardis ] let @xmath36 be a light ray from @xmath12 to @xmath5 , let @xmath6 be an observer at @xmath5 and let @xmath45 be the relative velocity of @xmath36 observed by @xmath6 . if we parameterize @xmath36 affinely such that @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 , then @xmath197 is the affine distance from @xmath12 to @xmath5 observed by @xmath6 .",
    "now , we are going to generalize definition [ d1.dist ] :    let @xmath0 , @xmath1 be two observers .",
    "the affine distance from @xmath1 to @xmath0 observed by @xmath0 is a real positive function @xmath198 defined on @xmath0 such that , given @xmath199 , @xmath200 is the affine distance from @xmath12 to @xmath5 observed by @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the 4-velocity of @xmath80 at @xmath5 , and @xmath12 is the unique event of @xmath1 such that there exists a light ray from @xmath12 to @xmath5 .    note that even if @xmath0 is comoving with @xmath1 , the affine distance @xmath198 from @xmath1 to @xmath0 observed by @xmath0 is not necessarily constant .",
    "inversely , if @xmath198 is constant then @xmath0 is not necessarily comoving with @xmath201 , as we will see in section [ s4.2 ] . only in some special cases we have",
    "that @xmath198 is constant if and only if @xmath80 is comoving with @xmath1 .",
    "for example in minkowski if the observers @xmath0 and @xmath1 are geodesic .    finally , we can define a distance on @xmath202 extending the concept of affine distance given in definition [ d1.dist ] , using the idea that an observer has to project light rays onto its physical space :    [ d2.dist]let @xmath6 be an observer at @xmath5 , and @xmath203 .",
    "the affine distance from @xmath12 to @xmath204 observed by @xmath6 , @xmath205 , is the module of @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the map  projection onto @xmath17 \" .",
    "it can be easily proved that @xmath208 moreover , expression ( [ distgen ] ) generalizes expression ( [ formdist ] ) in the sense that if we substitute @xmath204 by @xmath5 in ( [ distgen ] ) , we obtain ( [ formdist ] ) .",
    "the affine distance given in definition [ d2.dist ] is symmetric , positive - definite and satisfies the triangular inequality .",
    "so , it has all the properties that must verify a topological distance defined on @xmath209 .",
    "in this section we are going to show that affine distance is a particular case of _ radar distance _ in the minkowski space - time ( concretely , for geodesic observers ) , and generalizes the _ proper radial distance _ in the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "finally , we show that affine distance gives us a new concept of distance in robertson - walker space - times , according to hubble law .      in the minkowski metric with rectangular coordinates @xmath210 ,",
    "let us consider an event @xmath211 observed at @xmath212 by an observer @xmath213 , where @xmath30 is the gamma factor given by @xmath214 . then , using ( [ formdist ] ) , we have the general expression for the affine distance from @xmath12 to @xmath5 observed by @xmath6 : @xmath215 note that @xmath216 because there is a light ray from @xmath12 to @xmath5 .",
    "there exists a known method to measure distances between an observer @xmath0 ( that we can suppose parameterized by its proper time @xmath217 ) and an observed event @xmath12 , called radar method , consisting on emitting a light ray from @xmath218 to @xmath12 , that bounces and arrives at @xmath219 .",
    "the _ radar distance _ between @xmath0 and @xmath12 observed by @xmath0 is given by @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "so , considering a geodesic observer @xmath0 passing through @xmath5 with 4-velocity @xmath221 at @xmath5 we have that @xmath222 is the parameterization by its proper time . setting out that @xmath223 is lightlike and @xmath224 , from ( [ betamink ] ) we obtain @xmath225 comparing ( [ dmink2 ] ) with ( [ dmink1 ] ) , we state that affine distance coincides with radar distance for geodesic observers in minkowski space - time .",
    "the radar distance between a non geodesic observer @xmath0 and an observed event @xmath12 depends on the world line @xmath0 between @xmath218 and @xmath226 . on the other hand ,",
    "the affine distance only depends on the 4-velocity of the observer at @xmath227 , i.e. at the instant when the light ray arrives from @xmath12 .",
    "so , it is easier to calculate and it has more physical sense .      in schwarzschild metric with spherical coordinates , let @xmath228 and @xmath229 be two stationary observers like in section [ s3.2 ] .",
    "we are going to calculate the affine distance @xmath197 from @xmath230 to @xmath229 observed by @xmath229 .",
    "since @xmath231 is a light ray parameterized as in the hypotheses of proposition [ p2.pardis ] , with @xmath232 and @xmath233 , we have that the affine distance from @xmath12 to @xmath5 observed by @xmath6 ( where @xmath6 is the @xmath87-velocity of @xmath149 at @xmath5 ) is given by @xmath234 .",
    "this expression only depends on @xmath235 and @xmath236 , i.e. the events @xmath12 and @xmath5 can be any events of @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively , such that there exists a light ray from @xmath12 to @xmath5 .",
    "hence the affine distance @xmath197 from @xmath148 to @xmath149 observed by @xmath149 is given by @xmath237 so , @xmath197 is constant , but @xmath229 is not comoving with @xmath228 .",
    "expression ( [ dsch ] ) is precisely a known expression for the _ proper radial distance _ between spheres of radius @xmath235 and @xmath236 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so , the affine distance generalizes the proper radial distance given in schwarzschild metric .      in robertson - walker metric with spherical coordinates ,",
    "let @xmath228 and @xmath238 be two stationary observers at @xmath239 and @xmath240 respectively .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath230 emits a light ray @xmath36 at @xmath241 that arrives at @xmath238 at @xmath242 . to study distances in cosmology it is usual to consider the scale factor in the form @xmath243 where @xmath244",
    ", @xmath245 is the hubble constant , @xmath246 , @xmath247 is the deceleration coefficient , and @xmath248 , with @xmath249 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a universe in decelerated expansion and the time scales that we are going to use are relatively small .",
    "the _ proper distance _",
    ", @xmath250 , between two stationary observers at a given instant @xmath251 is defined as the coordinate distance multiplied by the scale factor @xmath166 ( see @xcite ) . the proper distance between @xmath230 and @xmath238 at @xmath242",
    "is given by @xmath252 .",
    "obviously , this distance is not the same as the affine distance ( which we are going to denote @xmath253 ) .",
    "we define the redshift parameter @xmath254 , obtaining that@xmath255    moreover , the _ luminosity distance _ , @xmath256 , between a stationary observer and a stationary light source at a given instant @xmath251 is defined as @xmath257 , where @xmath258 is the absolute luminosity and @xmath259 is the apparent luminosity ( see @xcite ) . applied to @xmath238 and @xmath228 at @xmath242 , we have @xmath260 comparing ( [ dlum_z ] ) with ( [ dpresent_z ] ) , we obtain that @xmath261 for @xmath262 .",
    "this distance is related to the geodesic deviation method , and it is studied in @xcite .    finally , we are going to calculate the affine distance @xmath253 from @xmath230 to @xmath238 observed by @xmath263 at @xmath242 .",
