    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) differ from slower - spin pulsars in important ways .",
    "first , their spindown rates and derived surface magnetic fields are several orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "msps have implied fields of @xmath24 gauss , while pulsars with periods of order one second are characterized by magnetic fields of @xmath25 gauss .",
    "closely related is the observation that the characteristic spin - down times of msps , ranging from several tenths to tens of gyr , far exceed those of slower - spin pulsars .",
    "some msps were born with periods near their present - day values and are , consequently , much younger than their spindown times ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , msps are thought to be active as radio pulsars for hundreds to thousands of times longer than strong - field pulsars .",
    "taking active lifetimes into account , it appears that there may be comparable numbers of young pulsars and msps in the galaxy though the birth rate of msps is @xmath26 times smaller .",
    "a second significant difference is that more than 2/3 of msps are in binary systems , while young , strong - field pulsars are largely solitary objects , a fact which has both theoretical and observational implications .",
    "clearly , the evolutionary pathways that gives rise to msps are integrally related to the interaction of the binary stars ( @xcite , @xcite ; for a general review see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , searches for msps must confront the additional selection effects that mitigate against the detection of accelerated pulsars . as is shown below , detection of the fastest spinning pulsars is inhibited by any effects that smear out the pulse , such as dispersive propagation in the interstellar medium .",
    "orbital motion , uncompensated for in the surveys we analyze here , also smears out pulses according to the change in velocity over the duration of the observation and is therefore most important for short period pulsars in compact binaries ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper , we analyze the spatial distribution of msps . our purpose is to derive the best estimates for msp population parameters through careful consideration of survey sensitivities as a function of pulse period , dispersion measure and other relevant factors .",
    "our census essentially measures the local number density of msps , the fall off in number density above the galactic plane and establishes upper limits on a diffuse , halo - like component of the msp population .",
    "we analyze the implications of the spatial distribution for the kinematics of the msp population , inferring the diffusive and impulsive velocity increments suffered .",
    "we compare predictions of the distribution of proper motions to extant observations , compare the spatial distribution of lmxbs and msps , and describe the importance of our determination of the msp kick velocity for binary evolutionary scenarios .",
    "we provide detailed analysis of the influence of selection effects on the discovery of short period pulsars and pulsars in binaries .",
    "our results have immediate relevance in a number of respects .",
    "recent msp surveys have been conducted on the premise that the msps are essentially isotropically distributed around the sun , at least to the depths that surveys probe .",
    "our results establish the scale height and show that arecibo type surveys see beyond it .",
    "the third way that msps differ from slow - spin pulsars is in their peculiar space motions .",
    "this is one of the main conclusions of the present paper .",
    "kinematic evidence ( e.g. dewey , cordes & wolszczan 1988 ; cordes 1990;@xcite ; nice & taylor 1995 ; nicastro & johnston 1995 ) suggests that msps are low velocity objects , with typical transverse speeds @xmath27 .",
    "such velocities are much less than young pulsars , which have an average speed @xmath28 ( lyne & lorimer 1994 ; cordes & chernoff 1996 ) .",
    "our results allow us to put more stringent , albeit statistical , limits on the msp velocities than has hitherto been achieved .",
    "the use of the spatial distribution of msps as an indirect means for determining their peculiar velocities is more robust than an analysis of proper motion data .",
    "the primary reason is that the orbits of msps are perturbed significantly from circular motion around the galactic center so that , given their ages ( @xmath29 gyr ) , corrections for differential galactic rotation can not be made .",
    "arnaud & rothenflug ( 1981 ) applied a similar spatial analysis to young , high - field pulsars as a means for determining their velocities .",
    "( the methodology is correct but their assumption that high - field pulsars form a steady , relaxed population is not . today we know that @xmath30 - 30% escape the galaxy and that many radio pulsars shut off before traveling to the limiting distance for detection . )",
    "our approach differs in several ways from those taken by other authors .",
    "first , we use a likelihood analysis to provide the best estimates of the msp population parameters , to account accurately for survey selection effects and distance errors , and to express clearly our physical assumptions .",
    "second , we restrict our analysis to pulsars with spin periods @xmath0 ms .",
    "we do so because it appears that these neutron stars ( ns ) are distinct from other pulsars that may have undergone accretion - driven spinup but were left with longer periods ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also consider them to be distinct from the higher mass ns - ns binaries , which have pulsars with longer pulse periods ( b1913 + 16 , @xmath31 ms [ taylor & weisberg 1989 ] ; b1534 + 12 , @xmath32 ms [ wolszczan 1991 ] ) .",
    "third , our approach includes the effects of interstellar scintillations , which modulate the pulsar flux density and influence the rate of detection in surveys .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : surveys ] we discuss sensitivities of pulsar surveys and derive quantities that are needed in our analysis .",
    "a preliminary attack on the problem is given in ",
    "[ sec : vvmax ] where we present a ` @xmath33 ' analysis , analogous to that used on quasars and gamma - ray burst sources , in order to illustrate the uncertainties involved in pulsar surveys .",
    "we derive the survey likelihood function in  [ sec : like ] and apply it in  [ sec : disk ] to a disk - only distribution of msps . in  [ sec : vfit ] we apply the analysis to a disk model based on numerical integration of ns orbits in the galactic potential .",
    "we consider a combined disk and diffuse halo - like model in ",
    "[ sec : disk+halo ] .",
    "sections [ sec : vel]-[sec : orbits ] present the implications of our results for the msp birthrate , the origins of msps and their velocities , and for the optimization of msp surveys . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we summarize the paper .",
    "a pulsar survey has a minimum detectable flux density @xmath34 that depends on radiometer noise , the pulse shape , and details of the fourier analysis used to find pulsars . in appendix [ app : smin ]",
    "we derive @xmath34 for surveys , which includes pulse broadening effects ( from interstellar dispersion and scattering and from detector time constants ) and the effects of flux variations from interstellar scintillations ( appendix [ app : iss ] ) , which are strong for the msp surveys .    for a given direction ,",
    "the minimum detectable flux density is a function of pulse width and period and radiometer - noise level .",
    "the minimum detectable flux density is a function of direction ( galactic coordinates @xmath35 ) , dispersion measure [ @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the free - electron density and @xmath38 is the pulsar distance ] , radio frequency ( @xmath39 ) , bandwidth ( @xmath40 ) and the number of channels ( @xmath41 ) , as well as system temperature ( t@xmath42 , telescope gain ( @xmath43 ) , the intrinsic pulse duty cycle , and additional survey dependent factors : @xmath44 @xmath34 depends on additional , unspecified parameters , especially those that describe orbital motion . in most of this paper",
    "we ignore such motion ; however in ",
    "[ sec : orbits ] we discuss survey biases against short period binaries and their possible effects on our conclusions . in figure",
    "[ fig : smin ] we show @xmath34 plotted against period for several values of dm .",
    "these curves apply for drift - scan surveys made with the arecibo telescope at 0.43 ghz toward the galactic pole and at zero zenith angle .",
    "we have used a numerical version of a 408 mhz survey ( @xcite ) to calculate the background sky temperature .",
    "we assume a gaussian pulse shape with 3% intrinsic duty cycle .",
    "while this duty cycle is shorter than those of some msps , the duty cycle and , hence , @xmath34 , is dominated by extrinsic pulse broadening from dispersion , scattering and instrumentation .",
    "pulse broadening from scattering is taken into account by estimating it from large scale galactic models for the electron density , as described by cordes ( 1991 ) and taylor & cordes ( 1993 ; hereafter tc ) .    the maximum distance to which a particular pulsar is detectable , @xmath45 ,",

    "note that @xmath34 depends implicitly on the dispersion measure in a given direction which , in turn , depends on @xmath45 .",
    "for this reason , @xmath45 must be found iteratively .",
    "figure [ fig : smin_vs_d ] shows ( as solid lines ) @xmath48 plotted against distance for several values of pulse period and for several directions .",
    "these curves illustrate the strong dependence of @xmath48 on direction and period .",
    "the dashed line indicates the inverse square - law variation of flux density for a source of 30 mjy at a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "the intersection points of the dashed and solid curves determine the maximum distances @xmath45 that a pulsar can be seen for the different cases .    from @xmath45 , the total volume to which the survey is sensitive in a given beam area is @xmath49 because of the strong period and luminosity dependence of @xmath45 and , hence , @xmath50 , the latter quantity may be used to determine the period and luminosity distributions of msps .",
    "we have applied the likelihood analysis to 8 pulsar surveys that have been reported in the literature .",
    "six use the arecibo telescope , yielding 11 msps , the seventh is the parkes southern - hemisphere survey that yielded 10 msps , as reported by manchester ( 1994 ) when the survey was about 75% complete.% was relatively free of rfi ( m. bailes , private communication ) . ]",
    "the eighth survey is the jodrell bank survey , a portion of which has been reported in the discovery of the msp j1012 + 5307 ( nicastro 1995 ) .",
    "we have not included j0218 + 4232 ( @xcite ) because it was discovered in an aperture synthesis survey with selection criteria quite different from the periodicity searches of the surveys we consider . in a future analysis of the distributions of msp orbital parameters",
    ", we will extend our analysis to synthesis surveys .",

    "[ fig : surveys ] shows the total volume searched in each of the 8 programs as a function of spin period for a fixed luminosity of 16 mjy kpc@xmath7 .",
    "the parkes survey by itself has searched the largest volume .",
    "the arecibo surveys in aggregate cover a comparable volume , a few kpc@xmath51 for a period of 5 ms . for comparison",
    ", the lower panel in figure [ fig : surveys ] , shows the maximum distance surveyed , @xmath52 , averaged over all directions searched in a given survey .",
    "the arecibo surveys probe about 3 times more deeply than the parkes survey .",
    "as we demonstrate in this paper , deep , high - latitude surveys at arecibo ( see references below ) sample distances that are well beyond the scale height of the population , while the southern - hemisphere parkes survey , covering a larger area on the sky but being less sensitive at most periods , is better optimized to finding msps .",
    "we note that the arecibo search volumes that are devoid of msps provide the most stringent constraints on the scale height of msps , whereas the totality of detected msps essentially determines the local msp number density .",
    "the main method of analysis in this paper uses a likelihood function to determine intrinsic properties of the msp population after accounting for survey selection effects embodied in @xmath34 , as calculated above . here",
    ", we motivate our discussion by applying a @xmath33 analysis to msp surveys .",

    "subsequent observations yield precise determinations of p , dm , @xmath54 , b. the flux density is @xmath55 at the time of discovery and @xmath56 as a long time average .",
    "the flux density is time dependent , owing predominantly to refractive and diffractive interstellar scintillation ( diss ; e.g. rickett 1990 ; kaspi & stinebring 1992 , stinebring & condon 1990 ; cordes , weisberg & boriakoff 1985 ) .",
    "a distance estimate derives from dm and the tc model for the interstellar electron density .",
    "the model and , in some cases , auxiliary measurements ( timing parallax , neutral - hydrogen absorption , and association with supernova remnants ; frail & weisberg 1990 ) yield a range of possible distances , @xmath57 $ ] .    the volume between us and a given pulsar in a beam of solid angle @xmath58 is @xmath59 the ratio of @xmath60 to @xmath50 from eq .",
    "[ eq : vmax ] , may then be written as @xmath61    applicaton of eq .",
    "[ eq : vvmax ] involves subtleties that depend on whether the flux density reported for a given object is influenced by the random process associated with diss .",
    "diss generally _",
    "increases _ the volume in which a pulsar can be detected ( cf .",
    "appendix [ app : iss ] ) . saturated diss that is not quenched by time - bandwidth averaging modulates the flux density by a random variable drawn from an exponential probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "though the modulation is less than unity more often than not , the net effect is to increase the volume by a factor @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ fig : vvmax ] shows @xmath63 for field msps plotted against @xmath64 .",
    "horizontal error bars reflect uncertainties in the measured flux density and distance errors , the latter also determining the vertical error bars on @xmath65 . in most cases ,",
    "we have used the 400 mhz flux density reported by taylor , manchester & lyne ( 1993 ) , which is usually an average of many observations and is influenced minimally by diss .",
    "flux calibrations are typically only about 20% accurate .",
    "weak pulsars can appear brighter than average due to diss at the time of discovery , however , so the discovery flux @xmath66 while @xmath67 .",
    "for these cases ( j0034 - 0534 and j0711 - 6830 ) , @xmath68 .",
    "the intrinsically brightest msp , b1937 + 21 , is detectable to only @xmath69 kpc despite its large luminosity @xmath70 mjy kpc@xmath7 because , at its low galactic latitude , dispersion and scattering effects grow rapidly with distance .",
    "consequently , we argue that the claimed upper distance limit , @xmath71 kpc , is a factor of two too large . the moderate - latitude pulsar j1643 - 1224 is attributed only a lower bound on its distance by the tc model , @xmath72 kpc , because its dm can not be accounted for by the model .",
    "we suspect that this pulsar s dm is enhanced by unmodeled ionized gas along the line of sight and that the distance is most likely less than 4.8 kpc . in the absence of further data ,",
    "however , we use the distance lower bound as is .",
    "apart from the pulsar with a questionable distance estimate ( j1643 - 1224 ) , figure [ fig : vvmax ] shows that msps are to be found at only low values of @xmath65 , suggesting , therefore , that the scale height for msps is @xmath73 - 1 kpc . to properly estimate",
    "the scale height requires careful accounting of selection effects in msp surveys , as we do in  [ sec : like ]",
    ". however , arecibo surveys at high latitudes search to several kpc for typical luminosities .",
    "the absence of high @xmath65 pulsars is therefore especially striking .",
    "the arecibo msps also tend to have small values of @xmath33 , as would be expected for surveys that search well beyond the scale height of the population .",
    "a survey for msps typically searches many beam areas for each msp discovery .",
    "the spatial distribution of msps determines this yield , along with the survey sensitivity as a function of period , the period distribution , and the luminosity function .",
    "here we derive the likelihood function for a survey , taking these factors into account .",
    "we take as observables the directions of all beam areas searched , the survey sensitivities in these directions , and the parameters that describe individual pulsars , including direction , period , flux density , and dispersion measure .",
    "we also use distance estimates based primarily on the electron density model of tc . such distances are imprecise and our method takes into account the large uncertainties in distance that translate into large uncertainties in implied luminosity .    consider a telescope beam with solid angle @xmath58 .",
    "the mean number of msps expected in the beam per unit period , luminosity and distance is @xmath74 where the number density of msps , @xmath75 , is an arbitrary function of position .",
    "we have assumed that the joint probability distribution of period @xmath76 , luminosity @xmath77 and position is _",
    "factorable_. the physical assumption is that the distribution in space is independent of the distribution of intrinsic pulsar properties ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) and , furthermore , that @xmath76 and @xmath77 are uncorrelated .",
    "we write the period pdf , @xmath78 , and luminosity pdf , @xmath79 , each with unit normalization . with the small number of msps currently available",
    "there is scant evidence that the factorization is or is not appropriate ; however , in the future , our method can be applied easily to more complicated joint distributions if warranted . in particular , we defer to another paper exploration of the joint statistics of @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",

    "our statistical method differs substantially from other studies of the msp population .",
    "a common approach to population studies , including pulsars and gamma - ray bursts , makes use of nonparametric estimators .",
    "the rationale is to try to draw inferences about certain properties of the population without assuming a specific class of models .",
    "in contrast , our likelihood analysis makes very specific assumptions about the class of models to be examined ; for example , we have assumed _ a priori _ that all probability distributions are continuous .",
    "the differences between parametric and nonparametric treatments highlights some of the strengths and weaknesses of our approach .",
    "it has been shown ( loredo and wasserman 1995 ) that nonparametric estimators may be derived from a special maximum likelihood model solution . since our parametric treatment is also based on a maximum likelihood analysis , it is straightforward to study the relationship between alternative methodologies by making a comparison of the assumptions made in the two searches .",
    "the special solution leading to the nonparameteric estimators of interest comes from a search for a maximum likelihood solution amongst all functions and generalized distributions ( i.e. delta functions ) with equal _ a priori _ weight .",
    "this class of functions is so large that the most likely model is _ always _ one which exactly and precisely describes the observed data ; thus , nonparametric estimators satisfy the rationale for which they are introduced .",
    "this contrasts with the parametric treatment adopted here for which the class of functions is ( by comparison ) extremely small .",
    "we liken nonparameteric estimators to models with large numbers of free parameters .    in deciding what treatment to adopt ,",
    "it is helpful to appeal to the bayesian odds ratio to decide whether adding a new parameter to a model is justified by the better description of the data it may entail . roughly speaking each newly added parameter",
    "will improve the quality of the model s description of the data .",
    "the odds ratio allows a quantitative decision to be made whether to adopt the more complex model by weighing the improvement in the description against the additional freedom to fit arbitrary data sets .",
    "the situation for the msp s is that the population is rather small and we have anticipated ( without any detailed investigation ) that the odds ratio will favor models with relatively small numbers of parameters .",
    "we have therefore focused in this paper on parameteric methods with small numbers of parameters .    an additional factor in our choice of parametric methods",
    "is that it is straightforward to include ancillary information about the population ( e.g. continuity of the model ) , whereas in nonparametric approaches such constraints are difficult to incorporate .",
    "moreover , we find the parametric approach naturally allows the inference of population parameters of significant interest ( e.g. cutoffs in the period distribution ) .",
    "the main drawback of the parametric approach is that the results apply only to the particular set of models that the parameters can describe .",
    "if the real data were much better described by some completely different unstudied model , one would have no indication of that fact . in this paper",
    "we have considered several plausible models but these can not begin to describe all possibilities .    a number of pulsar population studies are based in whole or in part on such estimators ( vivekenand & narayan 1981 , hereafter vn ; @xcite and @xcite ) . to be a bit more descriptive , in the vn method a scale factor",
    "is calculated for each object detected in a survey .",
    "the factor represents how many pulsars with the same period p and luminosity @xmath77 exist in the galaxy given the fraction of the galaxy searched . in our notation ,",
    "the scale factor is @xmath131 where @xmath45 , as before , depends on many survey and pulsar parameters , including @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the number of pulsars in the galaxy is then calculated through a sum over detected pulsars as @xmath132 the resultant total number of pulsars is a _",
    "mean value _ similar in nature to the mean value of the number density , @xmath133 , that we have calculated .",
    "one drawback is that the vn method estimates the number of pulsars in the galaxy _ exactly _ like those actually detected .",
    "in other words , it explicitly includes contributions to the mean only at the periods and luminosities of the known pulsars .",
    "it is inherently discrete as compared to our likelihood method based on continuous distributions .",

    "( the results do not assure stability against non - radial modes and the associated gravitational wave emission . )",
    "our overall fit for the period distribution suggests the existence of msps faster than those that are currently known ( 1.56 ms ) in view of the fact that the theoretical stability analyses do not rule out such objects . of course , there may be evolutionary reasons that such objects do not occur and we discuss the significance of the cutoff @xmath142 next .",
    "the specific value of @xmath142 depends , of course , on our assumption of a power - law distribution for @xmath76 .",
    "we have not explored other mathematical forms , but reasonable alternatives include a power law that flattens for periods less than some critical period and cuts off at @xmath142 or a distribution that rises slowly from zero at @xmath142 and peaks at or near 1.56 ms and then follows a power - law form like that we have fitted .",
    "it is easy to see that such alternative period distributions will lead to _ smaller _ @xmath142 than we have derived .",
    "the reason is that they imply that smaller volume has been surveyed for @xmath160 ms , so the allowed @xmath142 can be smaller .",
    "therefore , our derived @xmath142 using the power - law distribution is a maximally allowed value and suggests , conservatively , that the period range for msps may extend to as small a value as 1 ms ( 95% confidence ) or 0.65 ms ( 99% confidence ) .",

    "the inferred gaussian scale ( @xmath171 kpc ) and exponential scale ( @xmath172 kpc ) are in rough agreement .",
    "the values indicate that the msps have a relatively small scale height , comparable to the oldest disk stars .",
    "though the confidence intervals overlap , the actual shape of the distribution plays some role in the value of the scale height parameter and motivates , in part , a more physical analysis based on motion of objects in the galactic potential (  [ sec : vfit ] ) .",

    "wijers & van paradijs ( 1991 ) find far fewer globular cluster msps than do fruchter & goss or johnston , kulkarni & phinney even though they adopted a lower luminosity cutoff three times smaller than that of fruchter & goss ; the difference is probably related to their assumed dependence of luminosity on spin period and spin period derivative that was based on young , high - field pulsars .",

    "first , the z scale height implied by the lorimer velocity distribution is larger than that derived by us by about a factor of 2 .",
    "second , our inclusion of scintillation effects yields a search volume that is about 30% larger than otherwise .",
    "third , lorimer include four long period pulsars in their analysis with @xmath296 ms that we exclude from the msp sample .",
    "together these differences in the assumed spatial distributions and msp samples explain the size of the differences in the estimated total number of msps in the galaxy .",
    "bl synthesized a luminosity function for msps after correcting the observed numbers of pulsars for the volume scale factors .",
    "their luminosity function is consistent with a power - law slope of @xmath297 ( according to our definition of @xmath298 ) but with a roll - off below 10 mjy kpc@xmath7 .",
    "our method is able to constrain the lower cutoff on the luminosity function because we evaluate our results at values for @xmath77 other than those of actually detected pulsars .",
    "similarly , bl suggest that the period distribution decreases in going from 1 to 10 ms and roughly estimate that there can be no more than @xmath299 msps with periods with p = 1 ms . our results suggest that the number of pulsars between 1 and 1.5 ms is approximately 50% of the number with @xmath300 ms , or about 5000 pulsars .",
    "the evolutionary paths that lead to msps are poorly understood ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "if all msps are `` spun up '' by mass transfer from a companion star during an lmxb phase , then the birth rate of lmxbs must exceed that of msps .",
    "kulkarni and narayan ( 1988 ) estimated that the birthrate of field lmxbs is about 1 - 10% of the birthrate of field msps for an assumed lmxb lifetime of @xmath183 years . with a diminished lmxb lifetime ( @xmath301 years ) , the birthrates are brought into agreement .",
    "our improved estimate of the total number of msps in the galaxy does not significantly alter the rate mismatch nor its strong dependence on lmxb lifetime .",
    "however , our work of the last section does point out that the extrapolation from the local msp population to that of the galaxy is uncertain by a factor of @xmath302 ( and an additional factor of @xmath303 for beaming ) . as we will argue below",
    ", the kinematic similarity of the lmxb and msp population manifested in the observed scale heights is reasonably strong evidence of an evolutionary link ; given the great uncertainty in lmxb lifetimes , the best evidence for a causal connection between the two populations is not found in the relative number but in the similar spatial distribution .",
    "in addition , a comparison of the scale height distribution of msps with that of lmxbs can place significant constraints on evolutionary scenarios leading to msps .",
    "the galactic lmxb scale height derived from analysis of a flux - limited sample ( @xcite ) is ( 0.44 - 1.17 ) kpc .",
    "alternatively , based on distance estimates to a subset of lmxbs , van paradijs and white ( 1995 ) infer a scale height of 0.5 kpc and , furthermore , argue that the lmxbs are predominantly located at galactocentric radii less than 5 kpc .",
    "although the two vertical scales are comparable , the interpretations are quite different .",
    "van paradijs and white assume that the lmxbs have pop ii progenitors and that the scale height is set by large velocity kicks at birth ( of order 400 km s@xmath20 ) and the local disk acceleration , which they argue is 2.5 - 4 larger in the relevant inner regions of the galaxy than locally .",
    "this analysis ignores the finite birth scale height and the lifetime of the objects .",
    "naylor and podsiadlowski , on the other hand , infer that the lmxbs derive from pop i stars and have a scale height perpendicular to the plane that is roughly like that of the observed thin disk ( with a small additional kick ) , which has a nearly constant value .",
    "our _ local _ determination of the msp scale height is ( 0.53 - 0.81 ) kpc , comparable with the above lmxb estimates . if msps are descendants of the lmxb phase and if the scale height increases with age , then the local msp population should have a scale height greater than or equal to the lmxb value .",
    "if the kicks were as large as suggested by van paradijs and white , the minimum local scale height of the msps would be ( 1.25 - 2 ) kpc , clearly inconsistent with our results .",
    "in addition , our upper limit on the diffuse number density of pulsars suggests that the observed msps were born in the disk ( pop i ) .",
    "a consistent interpretation of the lmxb and msp data is that both are pop i and both are derived from a similar evolutionary channel .      in future work",
    ", we will discuss how the observed scale height of msps and the inferred @xmath11 velocities ( @xmath304 km s@xmath20 ) place stringent constraints on the evolution of binary systems that lead to msp formation .",
    "one of the main problems in understanding the lmxb evolution path is that the formation rate ( @xmath305 yr@xmath20 ) in the galaxy is so small that the pathway is _ a priori _ special .",
    "a proposed scenario is as follows ( @xcite ) .",
    "a binary composed of a massive star ( @xmath306 ) and a light companion ( @xmath307 ) with an initial orbital separation less than about 1000 @xmath308 will pass through an epoch of unstable mass transfer and common envelope evolution once the massive star begins to swell .",
    "the interaction ejects much of the envelope , drawing the pair to very small distances of separation . if the helium core of the primary is sufficiently massive it is able to continue to burn and collapse even after its outer hydrogen envelope has been removed .",
    "the resultant neutron star has an orbit far smaller than the size of the original giant primary , an essential requirement if an lmxb phase is to take place . starting with the pre - supernova system",
    "we have analyzed how a tight binary is affected by a combination of ( 1 ) asymmetric sn kick , ( 2 ) impact of ejected shell and ( 3 ) dissipative processes in the eccentric , surviving binary .",
    "two effects sculpt the properties of the binaries that survive to give lmxbs and/or msps . the intrinsic kick given a neutron star by the supernova explosion unbinds loosely bound binaries while the impact of the supernova shell on the secondary is responsible for destroying and/or unbinding tight binaries .",
    "the surviving binaries occupy a relatively narrow range in pre - supernova orbital separation , primary and secondary masses and have a limited range of center of mass velocities .",
    "most of this analysis is independent of the specific evolutionary pathway leading to the pre - sn progenitor .",
    "( we present the details of this analysis in chernoff & cordes 1996b . )",
    "orbital motion causes msps in compact binaries to be missed in surveys that assume the pulse period to be constant rather than doppler shifted ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all blind surveys for msps , including the 8 analyzed in this paper , make this assumption .",
    "one circumstance in which the results of previous sections may be altered is if the spin period and/or luminosity depend in some way on orbital period .",
    "for example , a relation between spin and orbital period might be expected on general evolutionary grounds for spun up msps ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some observations suggest a weak positive correlation ( @xcite ) implying that the selection against detecting spin periods less than 1.5 ms may be stronger than we have estimated . because the measured correlation is weak",
    "we believe that any modification to the distribution of spin periods on this account will be modest . in any case ,",
    "fast binaries have been missed in msp surveys and their ultimate detection can only increase our estimated space densities for msps .",

    "however , surveys 4,7 & 8 with @xmath312 min are insensitive to orbital motion only for @xmath313 . weighted by volumes searched , the surveys with longer @xmath314 contribute strongly to an overall selection against msp binaries with short periods . indeed ,",
    "j0751 + 1807 with @xmath315 was discovered in survey # 4 in a single harmonic , the higher harmonics having been attenuated by orbital motion ( @xcite ) .",
    "that yet - faster binaries with fairly massive wd companions exist is certain because objects like j0751 + 1807 experience orbital decay due to gravitational radiation on less than a hubble time .",
    "indeed , if msp - wd binaries achieve @xmath316 solely due to such inspiral , then it may be shown that the orbital period distribution @xmath317 .",
    "overall , our conclusions are unaffected for msps in binaries with orbital periods @xmath318 hr and with companion masses @xmath319 .",
    "proper consideration of orbital effects  and estimation of the msp orbital period distribution  requires an analysis of search volumes as a function of orbital period and companion mass as well as spin period and luminosity .",
    "such a study is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "future surveys made with greater sensitivities than heretofore using the upgraded arecibo observatory and the new gbt will be able to probe to greater distances while also circumventing orbital suppression of fourier harmonics . furthermore , algorithms that correct for orbital motion are becoming much more feasible with the prospect of computers with teraflops capability .",
    "the population distributions we have derived may be used to optimize new searches for msps .",

    "the latitude constraint ensures that the search depth does not exceed the msp scale height .",
    "the longitude restriction follows from the variation of the search volume in the plane .",
    "the detailed shapes of the contours are dependent on the survey frequency and duration ( per direction ) but suggest that future surveys which concentrate on low latitudes will maximize the number of new discoveries .",
    "however , deep high latitude surveys will better constrain the falloff toward larger @xmath11 of the disk population as well as place tighter constraints on or make detections of any _ bona fide _ diffuse or halo - population pulsars .",
    "for the hypothetical survey depicted in figure [ fig : aitoff ] , a total detection volume @xmath328 kpc@xmath329 is sampled , corresponding to discovery of @xmath330 disk msps .",
    "this number is for a uniform disk component ; any galactocentric radial dependence , likely to increase the number of msps toward the inner galaxy , will only increase the number of detected msps .",

    "comparison with figure  [ fig : surveys ] shows that , for the luminosity assumed for that figure ( @xmath343 mjy kpc@xmath7 ) , the parkes survey ( # 7 ) yields search volumes at these @xmath142 that are comparable to those needed to yield a detection of a pulsar faster than 1.5 ms .",
    "however , the assumed @xmath77 for the figure is larger than average and the parkes survey observes to depths that , for some directions , exceed the @xmath11 scale height .",
    "consequently , it is not surprising that a pulsar faster than psr b1937 + 21 ( p = 1.56 ms ) has not been found .",
    "nonetheless , future surveys should be able to probe this region of period space and either find fast pulsars or determine better the period cutoff to the msp population .",
    "our results indicate that deeper surveys at low galactic latitudes ( e.g. @xmath344 ) will yield the search volume needed to accomplish these goals .",
    "through a likelihood analysis , we have constrained the period and pseudo - luminosity distributions to be steep power laws with slopes @xmath345 .",
    "the distributions imply that the population of msps increases rapidly to smaller periods and smaller pseudo - luminosities . we infer a minimum period @xmath346 ms at 99% confidence and a minimum luminosity cutoff @xmath176 mjy kpc@xmath7 .",

    "our analysis assumes specific forms for the period and luminosity distributions , namely power - law functions , that undoubtedly influence the specific values for numbers of pulsars in a given period range and also on the minimum period cutoff .",
    "we have not tested other mathematical forms for these distributions , so the true cutoff for the period distribution may be different than we have derived .",
    "nonetheless , because the period distribution montonically increases with decreasing period , our quoted minimum period is _ larger _ than it would be for a function that plateaus or decreases with decreasing period below 1.56 ms .",
    "we consider the most important implication of our derived minimum period to be that msps faster than those already found may indeed be present in the galaxy : the surveys done heretofore can not rule out their existence .",
    "in addition , modeling of the spinup process using full general relativity ( cook 1994a , b ) implies that gravitational instabilities do not prohibit the formation of very fast msps . of course the ultimate existence proof for msps with @xmath160",
    "ms lies in future surveys that can explore large volumes of the galaxy at these small periods .",
    "such surveys will be feasible with new spectrometers that can sample more frequency channels at faster rates and with post processing that can contend with motion of fast pulsars in binaries .",
    "another implication of our results on the period distribution is that , if msps exist due to accretion - driven spinup of neutron stars , then accretion must ensue for sufficiently long times that periods shorter than 1.56 ms can be achieved . from the work of cook ( 1994a , b ) , such accretion appears possible without requiring typical ages for lmxbs that are so long as to resurrect the discrepancy between birth rates for msps and lmxbs .",
    "the observed scale height of msps implies that they are a low - velocity population among neutron stars , having an rms speed that is about a factor of 5 smaller than that of young pulsars with much stronger magnetic fields .",
    "a part of the total inferred dispersion we attribute to a kick unique to the evolution of msp systems ( @xmath22 km s@xmath20 ) and the rest to the effect of diffusive processes that increase the dispersion of old objects . a number of kinematic signatures that should be evident in larger msp samples ( transverse motions , asymmetric drift , shape of velocity ellipsoid ) are described .",
    "the disparity in velocity between the low - field msps and high - field pulsars might be taken as evidence that the two empirical classes of neutron stars are born through substantially different processes .",
    "if msps are produced largely through accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf and if that process yields only a small kick to the resultant ns compared to type ii supernova then the observed dispersions of msps and high - field pulsars may find a natural explanation . in any case",
    ", the similarity in scale height of msps and lmxbs shows that the formation of the ns in both objects is accomplished without substantial center - of - mass impulses and supports the notion of an evolutionary connection . on the other hand , if binary survival after the type ii supernova is the most significant bottleneck in the production of lmxbs and their msp descendants , it is possible that the processes that dictate survival of the binary system are also responsible for allowing only a limited range of center - of - mass velocities .",
    "correlations between spin and orbital periods and space velocity , such as those suggested by bailes ( 1994 ) , depend critically on the details of mass transfer and on the number of evolutionary paths that lead to msp formation .",
    "elsewhere , we will present our detailed analysis of the effects that sculpt binary survival .",
