    "the dynamical properties of fluids in heterogeneous materials offers a great challenge and have implications in many technological and environmental contexts . inherently multi - scale in time and space , mesoscale properties such as",

    ", the dynamics of a pulse of tracers is connected to the geometry of the porous medium at the pore scale . at longer times ,",
    "macroscale properties such as porosity and tortuosity come into play .",
    "theoretically , stochastic approaches have been an important support to the understanding of the underlying phenomena  @xcite , and have been used recently to show that adsorption and desorption processes may strongly modify the short and long time dynamics of the tracers  @xcite .    in numerous if not all practical situations involving particle diffusion and advection ,",
    "the carrier fluid is in contact with confining walls where adsorption may occur .",
    "these processes depend on the chemical nature of the solute , which explain why particles with the same charge may diffuse in the same medium with different effective diffusion coefficients .",
    "this species - dependent affinity is at the heart of all chromatographic techniques used in analytic and separation chemistry @xcite .",
    "it also plays a crucial role in the dissemination of toxic or radioactive pollutants in the environment , and conversely in remediation strategies .",
    "recently , the great interest for nanofluidic devices and for the transport in heterogeneous porous media has also raised the issue of the relevance of models which do not take into account these sorption processes .",
    "moreover , it was recently shown that stochastic resonance between these processes and some external field may be of practical importance , e.g. for molecular sorting  @xcite .    at the mesoscale ,",
    "the dynamics of particles in a fluid can be described by the continuity equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the one - particle density at position @xmath2 and time @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the particle flux , which is a function of the velocity field of the carrier fluid , the bulk diffusion coefficient @xmath6 of the particles and , if any , their charge and the local electric field arising from their environment .",
    "if adsorption is taken into account , solid - liquid interfaces located at @xmath2 have a surface concentration @xmath7 ( length@xmath8 ) that evolves with time according to : @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( length@xmath11time@xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( time@xmath12 ) are kinetic adsorption and desorption rates . for molecules",
    ", the rates can vary widely . as an example , the dissociation rate of dna double strands on a surface grafted with single - strand dna ranges from @xmath14 to @xmath15  s@xmath12 for a few tens of base pairs  @xcite .",
    "their adsorption rate can be adjusted by changing the grafting density .",
    "finally , we assume that the tracers ( the solutes ) neither diffuse into the solid phase ( even though that process can easily be accounted for using our algorithm ) nor dissolve the surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath16 and the dispersion coefficient @xmath17 of the tracers can be investigated by following the spreading of a tracer pulse in the fluid .",
    "this would amount to solving eqs .",
    "[ eq : advection - diffusion ] and [ eq : surface_concentration ] , _",
    "e.g. _ with a finite element method , for all possible initial conditions , which is computationally intractable for complex systems such as heterogeneous porous media .",
    "an alternative is to deduce @xmath17 and @xmath16 from the tracer velocity auto - correlation function ( vacf ) following  @xcite : @xmath18 where the vacf in the direction @xmath19 is @xmath20 at long times @xmath21 with @xmath22 the average velocity of the flow .",
    "the issue of averaging over initial conditions in eq .",
    "[ eq : def_vacf ] can be handled elegantly and efficiently using the moment propagation method  @xcite , which was recently extended to charged tracers  @xcite .    in order to compute the vacf of the tracers from eq .",
    "[ eq : def_vacf ] , one has to keep track of their velocity .",
    "for this purpose , we use the underlying dynamics of the fluid given by eq .",
    "[ eq : advection - diffusion ] , which does not rely on the velocity of individual particles , but on the one - particle solvent density .",
    "moreover , the simulation of heterogeneous multi - scale media requires a numerically efficient method .",
    "the lattice - boltzmann ( lb ) method @xcite offers a convenient framework to deal with such situations . in the lb approach ,",
    "the fundamental quantity is a one - particle velocity distribution function @xmath23 that describes the density of particles with velocity @xmath24 , typically discretized over 19 values for three - dimensional lb , at a node @xmath2 , either fluid or solid , of a lattice of spacing @xmath25 , and at a time @xmath3 discretized by steps of @xmath26 .",
    "the dynamics of the fluid are governed by transition probabilities of a particle moving in the fluid from one node to the neighboring ones : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , the so - called collision operator , is the change in @xmath29 due to collisions at lattice nodes .",
    "this lb equation recovers the fluid dynamics of a liquid and the moments of the distribution function are related to the relevant hydrodynamic variables .",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for reviews of the method .",

    "i.e. _ to solve eqs .",
    "[ eq : d_t_from_vacf][eq : def_vacf ] , we use the moment propagation ( mp ) method  @xcite . other methods could have been used , such as the numerical resolution of the macroscopic equations or brownian dynamics to simulate the random walk of tracers biased by the lb flow  @xcite .",
    "the latter method has often been successfully used , e.g. by boek and venturoli  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the mp method offers many advantages .",
    "first , mp relies on the same ground as lb .",
    "it is based on the propagation of a position and velocity distribution function  @xcite , therefore offering an elegant unified approach .",
    "secondly , mp allows for the propagation of _ any _ moment of the distribution function  @xmath23 , which offers great opportunities .",
    "for example , lowe , frenkel and van  der  hoef exploited these higher moments to compute self - dynamic structure factors  @xcite .",

    "[ eq : propagated_quantity ] represents the fraction of particles that did not move from @xmath2 at the previous time - step .",

    "@xmath41 .",
    "we now introduce a new propagation scheme in order to account for adsorption and desorption at the solid - liquid interface .",
    "while eq .",
    "[ eq : propagated_quantity ] still holds for nodes @xmath2 which are in the fluid but not at the interface , for the fluid interfacial nodes we define a new propagated quantity @xmath42 associated with adsorbed particles : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the probability for a tracer lying at an interface to adsorb , and @xmath45 is the probability for an adsorbed , immobile tracer to desorb .",
    "there is no restriction in the definition of @xmath10 and @xmath13 so that they may depend on geometrical considerations and on the local tracer density .",

    "[ eq : propagated_quantity ] . in order to compute the vacf of the tracers , one propagates as @xmath48 the probability to arrive at position  * @xmath2 * at time @xmath3 , weighted by the initial velocity of tracers .",

    "the boltzmann weights for solid ( @xmath50 ) , fluid ( @xmath51 ) and interfacial ( @xmath52 ) nodes read : @xmath53 where @xmath54 corresponds to the sorption free energy for interfacial tracers , @xmath55 with @xmath56 the boltzmann s constant and @xmath57 the temperature , and @xmath58 is the partition function of the tracers .",
    "the excess chemical potential @xmath59 includes in the case of tracers with charge @xmath60 a mean - field electrostatic contribution @xmath61 with @xmath62 the local electrostatic potential .",

    "in summary , we have proposed a new scheme that accounts for adsorption and desorption in a generic lattice - boltzmann scheme , allowing for the calculation of mesoscale dynamical properties of tracers in media of arbitrary complexity .",
    "these processes are modelled by kinetic rates of adsorption and desorption taking place at interfacial , fluid nodes .",
    "the algorithm has been validated over a wide range of adsorption and desorption rates and pclet numbers in the slit pore geometry where exact results are available .",
    "finally , we have shown on a more complex porous medium that adsorption and desorption processes may not be neglected , as they strongly modify the short , intermediate and long time behaviors of the diffusion coefficient as well as the dispersion coefficient . in turn",
    ", this demonstrates that neglecting interactions with the surface in the interpretation of @xmath16 as a probe of the geometry of the porous medium , as measured experimentally _",
    "e.g. _ by psge - nmr , may lead to incorrect conclusions .",
    "this scheme may now be used in two ways .",
    "first , one could predict the effective diffusion coefficient in complex heterogeneous media for species with known adsorption and desorption rates ( from experiments or molecular simulations ) .",
    "conversely , from reference measurements of the time - dependent diffusion coefficient in controlled geometries , one could extract the adsorption and desorption rates @xmath10 and @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , in the case of diffusion in the solid stationary phase , the method would allow us to relate the relevant diffusion constant to the shape of the elution profile .    while the present method is very general and",
    "also applies in principle to the case of irreversible adsorption ( @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath99 in eq .",
    "[ eq : newp ] ) , such a situation is of interest only outside of equilibrium .",
    "indeed , in that case at equilibrium all the solute is adsorbed on the surface and its vacf corresponds to the sorbed species only . the propagation scheme ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : propagated_quantity]-[eq : newp ] ) could nevertheless be used to investigate irreversible adsorption out of equilibrium by considering the density as the propagated quantity @xmath48 ( instead of the one described here to compute the vacf ) , as was done e.g. by warren to simulate electrokinetic phenomena  @xcite . as an example of practical application where ( possibly irreversible )",
    "sorption is coupled to electrokinetic phenomena , we can for example mention the case of ion adsorption onto charged minerals such as clays .",
