    "the problems related to the minimum area of a null homotopy of a closed curve traced multiple times have been studied for decades along with the plateau s problem . in 1968 , l. c. young @xcite constructed a closed curve @xmath1 in the euclidean space @xmath4 such that the least area of a surface with boundary @xmath2 is strictly less than twice of that with boundary @xmath1 in the context of integral current .",
    "roughly speaking , it is not necessarily twice as hard to fill a curve traced twice as to fill the curve traced only once with a surface in @xmath4 .",
    "his example was inspired by the embedding of the klein bottle into @xmath4 . in 1984 , f. morgan @xcite and b. white @xcite generalized his example to the @xmath5 case for any integer @xmath6 via different approaches from each other .",

    "this case particularly interests us because the homotopy group @xmath18 is commutative when @xmath19 , but not necessarily so when @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast to his result , we construct a closed curve @xmath1 in @xmath21 , such that the minimum area of a null homotopy of @xmath2 is less than @xmath3 times that of @xmath1 for any positive constant @xmath3 ( see theorem [ main - curve ] ) .",

    "e. w. chambers and y. wang @xcite investigated the computation of the minimum area of a regular homotopy between two simple curves on @xmath22-manifolds with the same endpoints . in our paper , a different method allows us to compute the minimum area of a homotopy , not necessarily regular , between two closed plane curves , not necessarily simple , in polynomial time and space , given that they divide the plane into finite number of regions ( see theorem [ distance - complexity ] and theorem [ main - relation ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the computation of the minimum area of a homotopy between two curves @xmath23 and @xmath24 with the same endpoints can be converted to the computation of the minimum area of a null homotopy of the closed curve @xmath25 .",

    "thus , the minimum length of the word representing such an element @xmath56 must be between @xmath568 and @xmath569 for positive constants @xmath567 and @xmath570 and sufficiently large integer @xmath76 , though the tighter bounds are currently unknown .",

    "let @xmath577 be a word representing @xmath56 over the alphabet @xmath578 with @xmath579 , then the word @xmath580 represents @xmath581 .",

    "let @xmath587 denote the set of @xmath46 such that @xmath588 is not an unpaired position in @xmath48 and that @xmath589 or @xmath590 .",
    "for each @xmath60 with @xmath591 , let @xmath592 be the set of pairs @xmath593 with @xmath594 . then because the pairs in @xmath48 are pairwise not linked , there are at most @xmath595 elements in @xmath592 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath596 .",

    "let @xmath607 be an auxiliary function defined by @xmath608then the set @xmath609 is a folding of the word @xmath610 representing @xmath611 .",
    "the sum of weights of the letters at unpaired positions in @xmath612 is equal to the sum of weights of the letters at unpaired positions @xmath46 with @xmath613 or @xmath614 in @xmath48 .",
    "therefore the sum of weights of the letters at unpaired positions in @xmath605 and @xmath612 is equal to @xmath365 , which implies @xmath615 .",
    "hence @xmath616 . because @xmath617 is represented by a word of length @xmath598 , by inductive hypothesis , we have @xmath618 , so @xmath619 .",
    "in fact , with a more detailed discussion we can prove that for a word @xmath577 of length @xmath620 and a folding @xmath48 of the word @xmath580 , there exists an integer @xmath621 such that @xmath622 , where @xmath623 is defined as in the preceding proof .",
