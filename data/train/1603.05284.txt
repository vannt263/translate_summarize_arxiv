    "correlation functions are fundamental objects for statistical analysis , and are thus ubiquitous in most kinds of scientific inquires and their applications @xcite . in physics ,",
    "correlation functions have an important role for research in areas such as quantum optics and open systems @xcite , phase transitions and condensed matter physics @xcite , and quantum field theory and nuclear and particle physics @xcite .",
    "another area in which correlation functions are omnipresent is quantum information science ( qis ) , an interdisciplinary field that extends the applicabilities of the classical theories of information , computation , and computational complexity @xcite .",
    "investigations about the quantum correlations in physical systems have been one of the main catalyzers for developments in qis @xcite .",
    "there are several guises of quantum correlations , and quantum discord stands among the most promising quantum resources for fueling the quantum advantage @xcite .",
    "when computing or witnessing quantum discord , or other kinds of correlation or quantumness quantifiers , we are frequently faced with the need for calculating coherence vectors and correlation matrices @xcite . and",
    "it is the main aim of this article to provide formulas for these functions that are amenable for more efficient numerical calculations when compared with the direct implementation of their definitions .    in order to define coherence vectors and correlation matrices ,",
    "let us consider a composite bipartite system with hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "hereafter the corresponding dimensions are denoted by @xmath1 for @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , let @xmath3 , with @xmath4 be a basis for the special unitary group @xmath5 .",
    "any density operator describing the state of the system @xmath6 can be written in the local basis @xmath7 as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the identity operator in @xmath11 .",
    "one can readily verify that the components of the coherence ( or bloch s ) vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 and of the correlation matrix @xmath14 are given by : @xmath15 it is worthwhile mentioning that the mean value of _ any observable _ in @xmath11 , for @xmath16 , can be obtained using these quantities .    in https://github.com/jonasmaziero/libforq.git , we provide fortran code to compute the coherence vectors , correlation matrices , and quantum discord quantifiers we deal with here . besides these functions , there are other tools therein that may be of interest to the reader .",
    "the instructions on how to use the software are provided in the readme file .",
    "related to the content of this section , the subroutine ` bloch_vector_gellmann_unopt(d_{s } , \\rho_{s } , \\mathbf{s } ) ` returns the coherence vectors @xmath17 or @xmath18 and the subroutine ` corrmat_gellmann_unopt(d_{a } , d_{b } , \\rho , c ) ` computes the correlation matrix @xmath19 .",
    "now , let us notice that if calculated directly from the equations above , for @xmath20 , the computational complexity ( cc ) to obtain the coherence vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 or the correlation matrix @xmath19 is : @xmath21    the remainder of this article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ coh_vec ] , we obtain formulas for @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 that are amenable for more efficient numerical computations . in sec .",
    "[ discord ] we test these formulas by applying them in the calculation of hilbert - schmidt quantum discords . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we make some final remarks about the usefulness and possible applications of the results reported here .",
    "the partial trace function @xcite can be used in order to obtain the reduced states @xmath22 and @xmath23 and to write the components of the bloch vectors in the form : @xmath24 thus , when computing the coherence vectors of the parties @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we shall have to solve a similar problem ; so let s consider it separately .",
    "that is to say , we shall regard a generic density operator written as @xmath27 where @xmath28    now , and for the remainder of this article , we assume that the matrix elements of regarded density operator @xmath29 in the standard computational basis are given .",
    "we want to compute the _ bloch s vector _",
    "@xcite : @xmath30 for the sake of doing that , a particular basis @xmath3 must be chosen . here",
    "we pick the generalized gell mann matrices , which are presented below in three groups @xcite : @xmath31 which are named the diagonal , symmetric , and antisymmetric group , respectively .",
    "the last two groups possess @xmath32 generators each .",
    "any one of these matrices can be obtained by calling the subroutine ` gellmann(d_{s } , g , k , l , \\gamma_{(k , l)}^{s(g ) } ) ` .",
    "for the first group , @xmath33 , we make @xmath34 and , in this case , one can set @xmath35 to any integer .",
    "it is straightforward seeing that , for the generators above , the corresponding components of the bloch s vector can expressed directly in terms of the matrix elements of the density operator @xmath36 as follows : @xmath37    these expressions were implemented in the fortran subroutine ` bloch_vector_gellmann(d_{s } , \\rho_{s } , \\mathbf{s } ) ` . with this subroutine , and the partial trace function @xcite ,",
    "we can compute the coherence vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    we observe that after these simple algebraic manipulations the computational complexity of the bloch s vector turns out to be basically the cc for the partial trace function .",
    "hence , from ref .",
    "@xcite we have that for @xmath20 , @xmath38    one detail we should keep in mind , when making use of the codes linked to this article , is the convention we apply for the indexes of the components of @xmath39 . for the first group of generators , @xmath40 , naturally , @xmath41 .",
    "we continue with the second group of generators , @xmath42 , by setting @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath45 . the same convention is used for the third group of generators , @xmath48 , but here we begin with @xmath49    next we address the computation of the _ correlation matrix _ @xmath14 , which is a @xmath50 matrix that we write in the form : @xmath51 with the sub - matrices given as shown below . for convenience ,",
    "we define the auxiliary variables : @xmath52    the matrix elements of @xmath53 , whose dimension is @xmath54 , correspond to the diagonal generators for @xmath25 and diagonal generators for @xmath26 : @xmath55    the matrix elements of @xmath56 , whose dimension is @xmath57 , correspond to the diagonal generators for @xmath25 and symmetric generators for @xmath26 : @xmath58    the matrix elements of @xmath59 , whose dimension is @xmath57 , correspond to the diagonal generators for @xmath25 and antisymmetric generators for @xmath26 : @xmath60    the matrix elements of @xmath61 , whose dimension is @xmath62 , correspond to the symmetric generators for @xmath25 and diagonal generators for @xmath26 : @xmath63    the matrix elements of @xmath64 , whose dimension is @xmath65 , correspond to the symmetric generators for @xmath25 and symmetric generators for @xmath26 : @xmath66    the matrix elements of @xmath67 , whose dimension is @xmath65 , correspond to the symmetric generators for @xmath25 and antisymmetric generators for @xmath26 : @xmath68    the matrix elements of @xmath69 , whose dimension is @xmath62 , correspond to the antisymmetric generators for @xmath25 and diagonal generators for @xmath26 : @xmath70    the matrix elements of @xmath71 , whose dimension is @xmath65 , correspond to the antisymmetric generators for @xmath25 and symmetric generators for @xmath26 : @xmath72    the matrix elements of @xmath73 , whose dimension is @xmath65 , correspond to antisymmetric generators for @xmath25 and antisymmetric generators for @xmath26 : @xmath74    we remark that when implementing these expressions numerically , for the sake of mapping the local to the global computational basis , we utilize , e.g. , @xmath75    the subroutine ` corrmat_gellmann(d_{a } , d_{b } , \\rho , c ) ` returns the correlation matrix @xmath14 , as written in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrmat ] ) , associated with the bipartite density operator @xmath29 and computed using the gell mann basis , as described in this section .",
    "the convention for the indexes of the matrix elements @xmath76 is defined in the same way as for the coherence vectors . the computational complexity for @xmath19 , computed via",
    "the optimized expressions obtained in this section , is , for @xmath20 , @xmath77 by generating some random density matrices @xcite , we checked that the expressions and the corresponding code for the unoptimized and optimized versions of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 agree .",
    "additional tests shall be presented in the next section , where we calculate some quantum discord quantifiers .",
    "the calculation of quantum discord functions ( qd ) usually involves hard optimization problems @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", a large amount of effort have been dedicated towards computing qd analytically , with success being obtained mostly for low dimensional quantum systems @xcite .",
    "although not meeting all the required properties for a _ bona fide _ qd quantifier @xcite , the hilbert - schmidt discord ( hsd ) @xcite , @xmath78 is drawing much attention due to its amenability for analytical computations , when compared with most other qd measures . in the last equation , the minimization is performed over the classical - quantum states @xmath79 with @xmath80 being a probability distribution , @xmath81 an orthonormal basis for @xmath82 , @xmath83 generic density operators defined in @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the hilbert - schmidt norm of the linear operator @xmath86 , with @xmath87 being the transpose conjugate of @xmath86 .    in this article , as a basic test for the fortran code provided to obtain coherence vectors and correlation matrices , we shall compute the following lower bound for the hsd @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the eigenvalues , sorted in non - increasing order , of the @xmath90 matrix : @xmath91 in the equation above @xmath92 stands for the transpose of a vector or matrix .",
    "we observe that the other version of the hsd , @xmath93 , can be obtained from the equations above simply by exchanging @xmath25 and @xmath26 and using @xmath94 instead of @xmath95 .",
    "it is interesting regarding that , as was proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , a bipartite state @xmath29 , with polarization vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 and correlation matrix @xmath19 , is classical - quantum if and only if there exists a @xmath96-dimensional projector @xmath97 in the space @xmath98 such that : @xmath99 based on this fact , an ameliorated version for the hilbert - schmidt quantum discord ( ahsd ) was proposed @xcite : @xmath100 with the matrix @xmath101 defined as @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are arbitrary functions of @xmath105 .",
    "then , by setting @xmath106 and using the purity , @xmath107 to address the problem of non - contractivity of the hilbert - schmidt distance , the following analytical formula was presented @xcite : @xmath108    thus both discord quantifiers @xmath109 and @xmath110 are , in the end of the day , obtained from the eigenvalues @xmath89 .",
    "and the computation of these eigenvalues requires the knowledge of the coherence vector @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) and of the correlation matrix @xmath19 .",
    "these qd measures were implemented in the fortran functions ` discord_hs(ssys , d_{a } , d_{b } , \\rho ) ` and ` discord_hsa(ssys , d_{a } , d_{b } , \\rho ) ` , where ` ssys = s ` , with @xmath111 , specifies which version of the quantum discord is to be computed . as an example , let us use the formulas provided in this article and the associated code to compute the hsd and ahsd of werner states in @xmath112 ( with @xmath113 : @xmath114 where @xmath115 $ ] and @xmath116 the reduced states of @xmath117 are @xmath118 , whose purity is @xmath119 .",
    "the results for the hsd and ahsd of @xmath117 are presented in fig .",
    "[ werner ] .    ) .",
    "the lines are the corresponding values of the ahsd plotted via the analytical formula : @xmath120 . due to the symmetry of @xmath117 , here @xmath121 in the inset",
    "is shown the difference between the times taken by the two methods to compute the ahsd for a fixed value of @xmath122 .",
    "we see clearly here that our optimized algorithm gives a exponential speedup against the brute force calculation of the bloch s vectors and correlation matrix . ]",
    "in this article , we addressed the problem of computing coherence vectors and correlations matrices .",
    "we obtained formulas for these functions that make possible a considerably more efficient numerical implementation when compared with the direct use of their definitions .",
    "we provided fortran code to calculate all the quantities regarded in this paper . as a test for our formulas and code , we computed hilbert - schmidt quantum discords of werner states .",
    "it is important observing that , although our focus here was in quantum information science , the tools provided can find application in other areas , such as e.g. in the calculation of order parameters and correlations functions for the study of phase transitions in discrete quantum or classical systems .",
