    "since the end of the last century , an analysis of the earth gravitational assist maneuvers of the galileo , near , cassini and rosetta spacecraft has disclosed an anomalous velocity change after some of these flybys [ @xcite ] .",
    "subsequent flybys of the galileo and rosetta missions were met with some expectation , in hope of reproducing this phenomenon .",
    "as table  [ flyby_table ] [ @xcite ] shows , these events yielded no further evidence of such a flyby anomaly  in the case of the second galileo flyby , this occurs because of the high uncertainty in the determination of the atmospheric drag , which is enhanced due to the much lower perigee of @xmath0 .    excluding cassini , none of the spacecraft had any available deep space network ( dsn ) tracking during perigee ( an approximate four hour gap ) , and during the remaining period ( covered by dsn availability ) the interval of approx .",
    "10 s between data points was too coarse for an accurate characterization of the effect .",
    "for this reason , no acceleration profile exists for the crucial perigee passages , so that the flyby anomaly can not be characterized as an additional force acting upon the bodies .",
    "instead , the flyby anomaly is revealed by the inability to trace a single hyperbolic arc ( _ i.e. _ an open orbit ) to the whole maneuver : instead , two distinct `` incoming '' and `` outgoing '' arcs were fitted to the spacecraft trajectory , with the slight difference between them being due to an additional boost @xmath1 at perigee ( see table [ flyby_table ] ) .",
    "the latter can be regarded as the currently available observable signaling the anomalous events .",
    "thus , one can only assign an averaged value to the putative force causing such deviations from the expected path of the spacecraft : this is found to be of the order of @xmath2 [ @xcite ] .",
    "albeit tentative , this enables the direct comparison with several known sources for perturbations to the hyperbolic trajectories , _",
    "e.g. _ earth oblateness , other solar system bodies , relativistic corrections , atmospheric drag , earth albedo and infrared emissions , ocean or solid tides , solar pressure , spacecraft charging , magnetic moments , solar wind and spin - rotation coupling , _ etc .",
    "_ [ @xcite ] .",
    "a list of the magnitudes of all relevant effects is given in table [ error_sources_table ] [ @xcite ] : clearly , these are all orders of magnitude smaller than the required value , with the exception of earth oblateness .",
    "this might hint that possible errors in the gravitational model of the earth could be the origin of the flyby anomaly .",
    "notice , however , that measurements throughout the years have produced an ever - shrinking scope of allowed values for the latter , with each new result confirming the previously available ( larger ) range .",
    "this `` zooming '' in on @xmath3 hints that no improvements on its determination should deviate from the currently considered constraints ; since any putative changes to the latter compatible with a flyby anomaly fall outside of this interval , such an explanation is deemed implausible [ @xcite]g .    as a result",
    ", the yet unknown origin of the flyby anomaly could signal the presence of new or `` exotic '' physics at play , a possibility which should not be taken lightly : indeed , while a new force could perhaps account for the flyby anomaly , it should also modify a plethora of other phenomena , from planetary orbits to etvs - type experiments .",
    "furthermore , no clear cut fundamental motivation exists for such a short ranged force ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite for a brief overview of some proposed physical mechanisms ) .    amongst the growing number of proposals , one highlights the empirical formula proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to fit the flyby relative velocity change as a function of the declinations of the incoming and outgoing asymptotic velocity vectors , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively    @xmath6    where the constant @xmath7 is expressed in terms of the earth s rotation velocity @xmath8 , its radius @xmath9 and the speed of light @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "this identification is reminiscent of the term found in the outer metric due to a rotating body [ @xcite ] ,    @xmath12    with @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the value of the newtonian potential @xmath16 at the equator , @xmath17 the earth s rotational velocity and @xmath18 its radius .",
    "however , such a suggestive relation is misleading : is impossible to derive from general relativity ( gr ) , and the flyby anomaly is much higher than the relativistic effects induced by the rotation of the earth : the geodetic effect and frame dragging .",
    "one could argue that the flyby anomaly only affects hyperbolic orbits , thus explaining why it hasnt been detected in satellites in low earth orbit  namely the gravity probe b mission [ @xcite ] which , at a altitude of @xmath19 , accurately measured both effects but did not detect an anomalous acceleration with magnitude comparable to the @xmath2 scale of the flyby anomaly , although it travels well inside the assumed zone where the latter is present .",
    "this possibility would imply an explicit breaking of the equivalence principle , according to which the acceleration of a body is independent of its properties ( namely , its energy ) and ( in the absence of non - gravitational forces ) only reflects the gravitational field [ @xcite ] .",
    "furthermore , predicted that the subsequent two flybys by the rosetta probe ( in 2007 and 2008 ) should experience an anomalous increase in @xmath20 of respectively @xmath21 and @xmath22 mm / s [ @xcite ]  while the subsequent analysis of the tracking data was consistent with no flyby anomaly being present .    with the above in mind , a more sober explanation for the flyby anomaly",
    "should not be dismissed : some poorly modelled behaviour of the affected spacecrafts could be the culprit , and also explain why the anomalous @xmath1 varies so widely with the different designs and gravitational assists .",
    ".[flyby_table]summary of orbital parameters of the considered earth flybys . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the drag forces experienced by the ste - quest spacecraft under worst case assumptions during perigee passage are given by the green line in fig .",
    "[ fig_2]b .",
    "the total transferred ( negative ) momentum per orbit is approximately 0.5 mm / s , considerably less than typical values of several mm / s encountered in previously recorded flyby anomalies ( see table [ flyby_table ] ) ; under less conservative conditions , the momentum transfer is more than an order of magnitude lower than this .",
    "some other perturbations such as solar radiation pressure , earth albedo and solar wind , although difficult to predict accurately , are shown to be negligible .",
    "this study shows that the flyby anomaly can be tested with the ste - quest mission , since its precise orbital determination accuracy is below the magnitude @xmath2 characterizing the former , and other perturbations are either below this level or can be successfully modeled and accounted for .",
    "the selected orbit for ste - quest is highly elliptical , and its perigee reaches an altitude as low as @xmath23 , enabling consecutive passages that allow for a replication of the typical velocities and altitudes of the reported flyby anomaly .",
    "the temporal resolution of the proposed gnss tracking ( possibly complemented with laser ranging ) allows for the detection of any unaccounted acceleration behind the flyby anomaly , greatly improving upon the current situation where the latter is signaled by the mismatch between incoming and outgoing hyperbolic arcs .",
    "this additional scientific application can be achieved by the ste - quest mission at no extra cost in hardware and with no additional operational maneuvers ; it does so by utilizing the provided onboard equipment and exploiting the baselined operational scenario , whilst relying on a natural evolution of the uncontrolled baseline orbit .",
    "furthermore , if a reorientation using its mps is considered for a small number of perigee passages , a possible dependence of the flyby anomaly on the attitude and cross section of the spacecraft could help shed some light into the origin of this puzzling issue in contemporary physics .",
