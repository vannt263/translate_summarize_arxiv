    "<S> the paper is devoted to the investigation of volume reflection and channeling processes of ultrarelativistic positive charged particles moving in germanium single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the choice of atomic potential on the basis of the hartree - fock method and the correct choice of the debye temperature allow us to describe the above mentioned processes in a good agreement with the recent experiments . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the universal form of equations for volume reflection presented in the paper gives a true description of the process at a wide range of particle energies . </S>",
    "<S> standing on this study we make predictions for the mean angle reflection ( as a function of the bending radius ) of positive and negative particles for germanium ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) crystallographic planes .    * volume reflection and channeling of ultrarelativistic protons in germanium bent single crystals *    * s.  bellucci@xmath0 and v.a .  </S>",

    "<S> in particular , a special interest lies in the possibility to use such crystals for collimation and extraction of proton and nuclear beams for lhc . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that most of the investigations with bent crystals were performed with silicon samples . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the article @xcite the experimental results of the deflection of high energy protons in germanium single crystal were presented . in this experiment </S>",
    "<S> a high enough deflection efficiency was obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> recently new experiments with germanium bent single crystals were performed . </S>",
    "<S> short germanium crystals were used and such phenomena as volume reflection and channeling of 400 gev protons were investigated@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the analysis of the results of measurements for volume reflection is practically absent and , for channeling , authors give calculations on the basis of moliere model for atomic potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> volume reflection represents a coherent scattering of relativistic charged particles in the planar electric field of the bent single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was found in monte carlo simulations in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical consideration of this process was presented in the paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this theory gives a very good agreement with experimental data for ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) interplanar fields in silicon single crystals ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this good agreement takes place when in calculations for atomic electric fields the data derived from x - ray measurements are used . </S>",
    "<S> calculations based on the popular moliere model of the potential give worse results .    </S>",
    "<S> we began our simulations of coherent processes in germanium single crystals from finding the mean angle of volume reflection . </S>",
    "<S> the first calculations were performed for moliere model of atomic potentials . </S>",
    "<S> however , the computed mean angles of volume reflection valuably exceed the measured ones . </S>",
    "<S> after this we applied the atomic potential based on the hartree - fock method@xcite to solve our problem . in @xcite the results of calculating atomic form factors ( in the hartree - fock method ) are presented in the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 are constants and @xmath5 is called the scattering vector . </S>",
    "<S> the relations for calculations of planar electric characteristics can be found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . however , for calculations of the interplanar potentials we should know the mean squared amplitude of thermal vibrations of germanium atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we can find this value from such an important characteristic of single crystal as its debye temperature . if we know the debye temperature @xmath6 we can find the mean squared amplitude of atomic thermal vibrations@xcite @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the atom mass , @xmath9 are the planck and boltzmann constants and @xmath10 is the crystal temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the debye temperature for any substance may be determined experimentally with the help of different methods . as pointed out in the paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> there is a difference in debye temperatures obtained from a specific - heat measurement and from measurements of x - ray bragg reflections . besides </S>",
    "<S> , the authors of the paper @xcite state that the debye temperature obtained from x - ray measurements is coupled with the thermal atomic vibrations and hence this value should be used in calculations of the mean square of thermal vibrations in the crystal . for silicon and germanium </S>",
    "<S> the debye temperatures are approximately @xmath11k and @xmath12k ( and correspond to 0.0645 and 0.068 @xmath13 of rms of thermal vibrations ) from a specific - heat measurement and @xmath14k and @xmath15k from x - ray measurements ( and correspond to 0.0747 and 0.0835 @xmath13 of rms of the thermal vibrations ) .    in the paper @xcite it was shown that the main equations describing the volume reflection may be presented in generalized parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mean volume reflection angle , @xmath19 is the critical channeling angle ( for unbent single crystal ) @xmath20 is the ratio of bending radius to characteristic radius @xmath21 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 is the particle energy , @xmath23 is the value of potential barrier for unbent crystal and @xmath24 is the interplanar distance .    </S>",
    "<S> for the first time here we present the explicit relation for the mean volume reflection angle in the generalized variables    @xmath25 dy\\ } \\ , % \\\\ % { \\nu \\over \\kappa } -{u(y_c)\\over u_0}-{y_c\\over \\kappa}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and the critical point @xmath29 is found from the relation @xmath30 . the main contribution in </S>",
    "<S> the inner integral brings the area near the @xmath29-point ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fact should be taken into account in calculations . for </S>",
    "<S> a thick single crystal ( @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a thickness of a crystal ) the area of large coordinates @xmath33 does not give contribution in the inner integral ( when @xmath34 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us call the function @xmath35 as the normalized potential . from eq.(3 ) </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the value @xmath36 depends mainly on the form of the normalized potential ( for thick enough single crystals ) </S>",
    "<S> . one can expect that if the normalized potentials for different planes or different single crystals differ slightly in between , then the functions @xmath37 for corresponding cases will also differ insignificantly in between . </S>",
    "<S> we remind that @xmath38 is a periodic function with the period equal to @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 illustrates the results of calculations ( with the help of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) ) of @xmath39)-functions for normalized potentials which were shown in insert a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we select for calculations the hartree - fock potential ( at @xmath40k and at @xmath41)k and moliere potential ( ( at @xmath41k and at @xmath42k ) and numbers of curves ( from 1 to 4 ) in the figure take place in the corresponding order . </S>",
    "<S> the curve number 5 corresponds to the ( 110 ) silicon plane and it is presented for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were done for @xmath43 mm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we select @xmath44k ( for moliere potential ) because then @xmath45 as in the paper @xcite .    as we predicted , </S>",
    "<S> the calculated @xmath46-functions are close in between . </S>",
    "<S> then we take the experimental data @xcite which was obtained for proton energy @xmath22 = 400 gev and found quantities @xmath47 and @xmath20 for every normalized potential . after </S>",
    "<S> that we also find values @xmath20 for x - axis and @xmath46 for the y - axis . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for every potential we calculate the corresponding experimental point . from the figure </S>",
    "<S> we see that for moliere potentials the obtained two points are far enough from corresponding calculated curves ( curves number 3 and 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the curve 1 is close enough to corresponding points with number 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we think the fact that both experimental points marked as 1 lie near the curve 1 is important and means that the relative location of these points has a natural ( regular ) character . </S>",
    "<S> these results we also present in table 1 for two values of the radius .    </S>",
    "<S> a similar procedure was made also for ( 111 ) planar potentials of germanium single crystal . as a result we got that the experimental data ( which was measured only for one bending radius ( equal to 15 meters ) ) are in a good agreement with the hartree - fock potential and @xmath40k ( @xmath48rad ( calculations ) and @xmath49rad ( experiment ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of calculating the mean angle reflection presented here for different atomic models and debye temperatures and their comparison with experiment show that a good agreement is observed for the atomic model on the basis of hartree - fock model and debye temperature equal to @xmath15k . in principle </S>",
    "<S> this is an expected result . </S>",
    "<S> really , in the calculations the hartree - fock model was applied for every sort of atoms , taking into account some specific atomic properties . </S>",
    "<S> the recommendation for the value of @xmath6 for germanium follows from paper @xcite and stands upon x - ray measurements and theoretical consideration .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that the process of volume reflection in germanium may be described well enough with the help of the hartree fock potential at @xmath40k . besides </S>",
    "<S> , our calculation of some channeling characteristics in this potential should also be compared with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the deflection efficiency has been measured experimentally ( see @xcite ) as a function of the incoming angle relative to the ( 110 ) crystallographic plane of germanium . </S>",
    "<S> the particles with an incoming angle in a @xmath50rad interval around a given value are selected ; the efficiency of deflection for those particles was then computed as the ratio of the number of deflected particles to their total number .    </S>",
    "<S> we made the calculations of deflection efficiency for the germanium crystal for the ( 110 ) plane and different potential models for 2.3 and 8.2 meter bending radii . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation was performed by monte carlo method and on the basis of a one - trajectory approximation of a diffusion process which was developed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we got the following results for zero incoming angle : for hartree - fock potentials the deflection efficiencies are 77.5 and 54 ( at @xmath40k ) and 81 and 59.5 ( at @xmath41k ) percents , and for moliere potential the deflection efficiencies are 78.5 and 61 ( at @xmath42k ) and 81.5 and 65 ( at @xmath41 ) percents . here </S>",
    "<S> the first value in every pair of quantities corresponds to a bending radius equal to 8.2 meter and the second one corresponds to 2.3 meter for the bending radius . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding measured values are ( 74.1@xmath511.5)% for r=8.2 m and ( 56 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath511.5)% for r=2.3 m .    besides </S>",
    "<S> , in table 1 the angle acceptance of bending ( 110 ) germanium plane is compared with the experimentally defined one . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we see a satisfactory agreement .    as a result of our consideration </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the choice of hartree - fock potential and the corresponding debye temperature allows one correctly to describe channeling and volume reflection processes in germanium single crystals with agreement with experimental data , we present our calculations in a universal form which may be used at various initial conditions ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . from here </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the mean angle of volume reflection is @xmath52 larger for germanium in comparison with silicon at the same beam energy . despite the small mean angle of volume reflection </S>",
    "<S> we expect a valuable gain when using this phenomenon in multi strip crystal systems@xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we would like to make a statement of common meaning that the usage of more precise atomic potentials than the moliere one , in calculations of coherent phenomena in single crystal , is preferable .    </S>",
