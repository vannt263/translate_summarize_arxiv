    "in fact , knowledge of the contact matrix can predict many features of the vibrational spectra of certain proteins @xcite .",
    "this makes it important to have information about the relation between the space of contact matrices and that of the proteins they represent .    to answer the question of how much information about a polymer",
    "is retained by its contact matrix , we consider an idealized version of the geometrical structure of a polymer in which the monomers occupy sites on the @xmath21-dimensional lattice @xmath22 , and consecutive monomers are on nearest neighbor lattice sites .",

    "@xmath27 remains strictly less than one , which means that the loss of information due to the coarse graining becomes substantial ( see ( [ eq2.3b ] ) and theorem  [ thmd ] ) .",
    "we also consider the problem addressed already in  @xcite , i.e.how the number of different _ physical _ contact matrices @xmath30 depends on the polymer length @xmath7 .",
    "it was shown there analytically that @xmath30 increases exponentially in @xmath7 , and numerically that the growth exponent @xmath31 is strictly less than the growth exponent for the total number of saw . in our work",
    "we give a rigorous proof of this ( see theorem  [ thmd ] ) .",
    "we also consider the same problem for srw .",
    "surprisingly , the growth exponent for the contact matrices is now the same as for the number of srw in all dimensions .",
    "the reason for this is that the probability distribution of the number of distinct visited sites ( divided by @xmath7 ) has a left tail which does not decay exponentially fast in @xmath7 . to conclude , we provide lower bounds on @xmath31 , relevant to the finite size behaviour ( see ( [ eq2.2a ] ) and ( [ eq2.3a ] ) ) .",
