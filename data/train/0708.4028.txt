    "another topic which has drawn a great deal of interest , in terms of bec double - well and nonlinear optics @xcite alike , is _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ ( ssb ) in matter waves or optical beams trapped in settings based on double - well potentials ( using the terminology widely adopted in optics @xcite , the medium corresponding to each potential well is sometimes called a  core \" below ) .",
    "if two parallel  cigar - shaped \" traps are strong enough , the system may be described by a pair of one - dimensional gpes with linear coupling between them @xcite , hence the destabilization of symmetric solitons and spontaneous transition to asymmetric ones in the double cigar - shaped trap , filled with self - attractive condensate , is described in the same way as the formation of asymmetric solitons in the well - studied model of dual - core nonlinear optical fibers @xcite ( in nonlinear optics , the ssb of 1d solitons was also studied in dual - core models with non - kerr nonlinearities , such as quadratic @xcite and cubic - quintic @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the dual - core bec  waveguide is realized as a set of two parallel finite - width potential troughs , separated by a finite buffer layer , which are embedded in a 2d ( horizontal ) trap and tightly confined in the transverse ( vertical ) direction , the ssb in the respective double - core solitons can be examined in the framework of the full 2d gpe ( i.e. , considering the tunneling across the buffer layer explicitly , rather than approximating it by the linear coupling between the two 1d equations ) @xcite .",

    "subcritical _ symmetry - breaking bifurcation for solitons in the self - attractive condensate [ which means that branches of asymmetric solutions emerge as unstable ones at the ssb point , and originally go backward ( for which reason the bifurcation is also called a backward one ) , but then turn forward , stabilizing themselves at the turning point ] .",

    "the generalization to the higher dimension is significant , because 2d solitons are drastically different from their 1d counterparts @xcite , especially in the case of the self - attractive nonlinearity ( the existence of the respective 2d solitons is fundamentally restricted by the possibility of collapse ) . besides that , the new species of vortex solitons is possible in 2d geometry @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    ", we observe that the bifurcation which breaks the ( quasi-)symmetry of solitons at a critical value of @xmath10 is replaced by the _ pseudo - bifurcation _ , i.e. , the branch of asymmetric solutions asymptotically approaches its quasi - symmetric counterpart with the increase of @xmath10 , but the bifurcation does not happen , since the two branches never merge .",
    "a similar phenomenon was reported in the 1d model with @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "the replacement of the bifurcation by the pseudo - bifurcation is observed only in the case of the largest mismatch , @xmath16 and/or @xmath135 , and it explains the above - mentioned total instability of the family of quasi - symmetric solitons , as the corresponding branch never has a chance to get stabilized by the inverse bifurcation ( if one considers the evolution of the solutions with the increase of @xmath10 at fixed total norm @xmath136 ) .",
    "a new feature specific to the 2d system is that , in the system with the largest diagonal mismatch , @xmath131 , the numerical procedure suddenly ceases to converge at some critical value of @xmath10 , and no asymmetric solitons are found past this point .",
    "for instance , at @xmath137 a stable asymmetric soliton with a regular profile can be found , but when the coupling increases to @xmath138 , the soliton is lost .",
    "the shape of the @xmath139 dependence in fig .",
    "offset_aa_bif(b ) strongly suggests that the branch of asymmetric solitons terminates , in this case , due to a tangent bifurcation , which results from collision and mutual annihilation of the branch with an additional branch of unstable solutions , that we did not aim to find .",
    "other types of stable solitons and vortices have also been found in the misaligned system of the aa type . in particular , an example of a soliton with two peaks in one component and a single peak in the other is shown in fig .",

    "we have introduced experimentally relevant models of two stacked flat bectraps , with attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms .",
    "each flat trap carries an ol ( optical lattice ) , stable 2d solitons being impossible without it .",
    "first , it was demonstrated that the linear coupling splits every finite bandgap in the linear spectrum of the single - component model into two subgaps , which are separated by narrow bloch bands .",
    "the main issue , addressed in this work by means of the va ( variational approximation ) and numerical methods , is ssb  ( spontaneous symmetry breaking ) in families of solitons and localized vortices , as a result of the competition of three factors : the attractive or repulsive nonlinearity in each core , the action of the ol potential , and the linear coupling between the cores . similar to what was found in the zero - dimensional setting @xcite ( this means a double - well potential without any transverse dimension ) and one - dimensional models @xcite , the ssb occurs in families of symmetric or antisymmetric states , in the case of the attractive or repulsive nonlinearity , respectively . in either case",
    ", the corresponding bifurcation destabilizes the branch of symmetric or antisymmetric solitons or vortices , giving rise to a stable branch of asymmetric solutions .",
    "the va , based on the gaussian ansatz , yields an accurate prediction for the bifurcation and the branch of asymmetric solitons generated by the bifurcation .",
    "a feature specific to the 2d setting is the termination of all stable branches in the aa ( attraction - attraction ) system due to the onset of collapse .",
    "stable asymmetric solitons sitting in higher finite bandgaps , and localized vortices with multiple values of the topological charge have been found too .",
    "in addition , the models considered in this work give rise to first examples of ( stable ) embedded solitons and embedded vortices _",
    "_  _ _ ( localized states found inside bloch bands separating the subgaps ) in any 2d setting .",
    "solitons and localized vortices were also considered in the linearly - coupled systems whose symmetry is broken by opposite signs of the nonlinearity in the two traps , or by a mismatch between the ols in them . in the former case , the system gives rise to two distinct types of stable solitons and vortices , which are dominated by either a self - attractive component or self - repulsive one , which sit , respectively , in the semi - infinite gap , or in a finite bandgap . in the system with mismatched lattices ,",
    "the phenomenon of the pseudo - bifurcation ( which was recently reported in the 1d system @xcite ) was found : when the mismatch takes the largest value ( @xmath0 ) in any direction ( horizontal or diagonal ) , the ssb bifurcation fails to happen , as branches of asymmetric and quasi - symmetric ( or quasi - antisymmetric ) solutions asymptotically approach each other , but never merge .",
