    "in spite of the complexity of galaxy evolution and the diversity of individual galaxies , patterns have emerged in galaxy formation .",
    "for example , roughly speaking , galaxies are expected to start out star forming and small and then grow larger to eventually become `` red and dead '' .",
    "this qualitative pattern provides targets for theories to predict and explain , both qualitatively and , with more detailed theories and observations , quantitatively . in this paper",
    "we look for patterns in populations of simulated galaxy stellar mass histories , using a few standard statistical methods . the aim is to find characterizations of sets of galaxy histories produced by simulations , which can be used to intercompare different sets of full histories , or different simulation models .",
    "we focus on simulations , because simulations produce histories directly .",
    "observationally one can estimate how populations at different times are connected , but in a simulation one can watch directly how populations evolve into each other .",
    "the full set of histories from a simulation explores the consequences of the assumptions ( e.g. relations and sub - grid models ) used in their construction .",
    "in fact , the full set of histories produced by a simulation provide one answer to the question `` how do galaxies form ? '' ( for a particular model ) .    given a set of simulated or observationally inferred galaxy histories ,",
    "an immediate quantity of interest is the average history .",
    "average histories of some galaxy properties have been deduced using a combination of models and observations ( for average stellar mass histories , e.g. , @xcite , for the star forming main sequence , e.g. , @xcite and for star formation histories , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as observational and simulation data grow in amount and detail , samples and questions can be refined beyond such average properties .",
    "one extension is to track subpopulations , either directly in simulations or observationally via the use of various proxies ( e.g. the most massive galaxies ) .",
    "here we take a different route , taking all simulated galaxies which share essentially the same final stellar mass , and classifying properties of the combined set of their full histories .",
    "these classifications can search for and succinctly capture simplifying features of the full simulated galaxy history population .",
    "as such , they can be used to identify points of contact between observations and theoretical assumptions , to compare theoretical models to each other , and to compare subsamples within the same theoretical model .",
    "our main focus is on ensembles of stellar mass histories .",
    "these are a priori fairly complicated , as many different physical quantities and processes can impact the stellar mass .",
    "for instance , stellar mass can grow through star formation or by merging , and can decrease by , e.g. , tidal stripping , stellar winds or supernovae .",
    "these effects can interact with each other and with other galaxy properties , complicating the interpretation of the consequences of modeling assumptions . by having",
    "a simple description of the full population of stellar mass histories , consequences of the full interplay between different contributing factors may be easier to identify .",
    "our primary approach is principal component analysis ( pca ) , a standard classification algorithm , although we also briefly explore mixture model classifications and k - means classifications .",
    "we consider both semi - analytic models grafted onto a dark matter simulation ( millennium , @xcite , see  [ sec : methods ] below ) and two hydrodynamic simulations from the overwhelmingly large simulations ( owls , @xcite ) project .",
    "to anticipate some key points , pca characterizes fluctuations around an average history and we find that the histories do in fact , for all cases we consider , roughly peak around an average history ( although not necessarily in a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "interestingly , we also find that for every sample , the leading pca fluctuation significantly dominates the variance around the average stellar mass history , with close to 90% of the variance captured by the first three pca fluctuations .",
    "this is a large simplification of the diverse population of galaxy stellar mass histories .",
    "the total contribution of each fluctuation ( i.e.  principal component ) around the average history , the distribution of their coefficients and their shapes carry information about the full ensemble of galaxy stellar mass histories .",
    "the leading principal component is similar for several of the millennium histories and one corresponding owls model . the amount of variance due to the leading principal component changes with final stellar mass , as does the contribution of the leading principal component to the star forming main sequence inferred from observational samples . with an eye to determining stellar mass history properties from fixed time observations ,",
    "we relate some of our classification properties to a range of @xmath0 galaxy observables .",
    "we also find correlations between pca quantities and a variety of galaxy halo history and stellar mass history properties used in other contexts .",
    "the dominance of the first few @xmath1 allows a simplified description of the set of all histories sharing the same final stellar mass , based upon properties of the ensemble of their histories .",
    "we go beyond this basic pca classification in a few ways .",
    "we briefly explore two other classification methods , k - means clustering and mixture models , where instead of classifying fluctuations around a single average history , one assigns galaxies to ( usually one of ) several characteristic histories , removing the assumption of symmetry around an average path .",
    "we also consider how well the pca description provides approximations to stellar mass histories of individual galaxies , when using only the leading principal components .",
    "finally , we also consider pca of a few other galaxy history properties .",
    "closely related to this work , pca of dark matter halo mass histories was performed by @xcite , who found relations to structural properties of halos such as concentration .",
    "we touch upon some relations between halo history pca and stellar mass history pca for our stellar mass selected samples .    in ",
    "[ sec : methods ] the simulations and our application of principal component analysis , pca , are described .",
    "pca is applied to the stellar mass histories in  [ sec : pca ] ( applications to star formation rate histories , specific star formation rate histories and halo histories are briefly mentioned ) . in ",
    "[ sec : corrlns ] correlations of pca properties with some galaxy @xmath0 and galaxy and halo history properties are shown , while in  [ sec : splitsamp ] we describe our different separations of the full sample into classes by using k - means clustering and mixture models .",
    "we discuss and summarize our results in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the appendix discusses approximating histories using subsets of the principal components .",
    "we first describe the n - body simulation plus semi - analytic modeling and hydrodynamical simulations used to create the stellar mass histories , and then our use of pca to characterize these , as well as the halo mass histories , star formation rate histories and specific star formation rate histories .",
    "we describe our use of mixture models and k - means clustering in  [ sec : splitsamp ] itself as these are only used briefly .",
    "our main simulation source was the millennium database , @xcite , built upon the millennium dark matter simulation @xcite , a 500 @xmath2 side box with @xmath3 particles .",
    "we used the galaxy histories from the semi - analytic model mr7 of @xcite , with the wmap7 cosmology : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we considered 6 different final ( @xmath0 ) stellar mass bins , @xmath9 .",
    "several properties of the samples are shown in table [ tab : samprops ] ( e.g.  the range of final stellar masses , median halo mass , number of galaxies ) .",
    "the other columns are described and defined in subsequent sections .",
    "for the three highest final stellar mass bins we took all such galaxies in the simulation , for the three lower mass bins we instead took a large number of galaxies with adjacent peano hilbert indices , i.e. in nearby volumes within the simulation ( the smallest volume used was @xmath101/4 of the simulation , large enough to not be affected by sample variance ) .",
    "the output times are equally spaced in @xmath11 ; we took the 42 steps numbered 20 to 61 ( starting at redshift 4.5 and ending at redshift 0 ) .",
    "we also downloaded histories of halo virial mass @xmath12 ( equal to the infall mass for satellites , i.e. after a galaxy becomes a satellite its halo mass remains fixed at its infall mass ) , host halo mass @xmath13 ( which differs from virial mass for satellites ) , star formation rates , history of centrality ( central or satellite ) , infall time ( if satellite ) , g and r colours for sdss including dust , and stellar bulge mass . for terminology ,",
    "a satellite galaxy is a galaxy that has fallen into a halo of a larger galaxy ( the infall time is when this happens , and the satellite galaxy s halo is then called a subhalo ) .",
    "the millennium simulation combines dark matter halo histories and a model of how gas and subgrid properties behave as dark matter halos evolve to predict corresponding properties such as stellar mass , star formation , etc .",
    "we also considered simulations from the owls project @xcite , which include gas properties in the simulation itself .",
    "we used galaxy histories from two owls models : agn+sn (  agn ",
    ", for details about the agn feedback model see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sn only (  ref  , for details about the sn feedback model see * ? ? ?",
    "for more discussion of the these simulations and their galaxy property results , see also e.g. @xcite .",
    "these simulations use a different cosmology than the millennium samples ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , in particular a lower @xmath17 , implying slightly later structure formation .",
    "they have @xmath18 dark matter and @xmath18 baryonic particles in a 100  comoving  @xmath19mpc side box .",
    "we concentrated on a single final stellar mass range , @xmath20 , with 800 galaxies , at 20 redshifts from @xmath0 to 5 ( with varying time steps , shown as the discrete points in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc0comp ] ) .",
    "higher stellar mass samples are too small due to the simulation volume , and lower stellar mass samples can not be traced very far back in time due to resolution , so we limit ourselves to only one final stellar mass bin .",
    "these two owls samples can help indicate trends which change with variations in gas physics or other assumptions .",
    "this is especially useful given studies which contrast properties between semi - analytic histories and histories inferred from observational data sets ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite consider hydrodynamic simulations as well ) .    in both the millennium and owls simulations ,",
    "halos are identified by using a friends - of- friends ( fof ) algorithm .",
    "if the separation between two dark matter particles is less than 20 per cent of the average separation ( the linking length b = 0.2 ) , they are placed in the same group .",
    "subsequently subfind @xcite is used on the fof output to find the gravitationally bound particles and to identify subhalos . for owls ,",
    "baryonic particles are linked to a halo or subhalo if their nearest dark matter neighbour is in that halo , and galaxy stellar masses are calculated by adding up all the mass in stars in the halo or subhalo to which the galaxy belongs .",
    "we start by interpreting a galaxy s stellar mass @xmath21 at a given time @xmath22 as the galaxy s position along a @xmath22 coordinate axis , in a space with as many dimensions as there are time steps @xmath22 ( which we choose to be the output times of the millennium and owls models respectively ) . in this way",
    ", each galaxy history becomes a vector , with each vector component corresponding to the galaxy s stellar mass at a particular output time .",
    "every galaxy ( vector ) is then a single point in an @xmath23-dimensional space , where @xmath23 is the number of time outputs . to apply pca",
    ", we shift the coordinates to make the average path @xmath24 the origin , also a single point , in this space .",
    "all the galaxy histories then form a cloud of some shape around this origin .",
    "pca characterizes the shape of this cloud , i.e.  the fluctuations .",
    "so we are concerned with each history s deviation from the average , @xmath25 .",
    "we can assign to each galaxy history a squared distance as well , @xmath26 note that our choice of time output spacing affects @xmath27 , as each output time , or coordinate direction in this space , is given the same weighting .",
    "( however , as we describe below , we can often smoothly interpolate results from one time output spacing to another . )",
    "the covariance matrix of the fluctuations from the average path is given by @xmath28 this sum is straightforward to calculate from a set of histories and results in an @xmath29 matrix , with @xmath23 the number of time outputs .",
    "diagonalizing the covariance matrix to find basis fluctuations which have zero covariance with each other is the main idea behind pca .",
    "one reference for principal component analysis is @xcite , for other applications to galaxies see e.g. , @xcite , for cluster observables see , e.g. , @xcite and for dark matter halos see @xcite . @xcite",
    "consider halo histories and is most closely related to the work here .",
    "pca of stellar population synthesis models and fixed time observables is considered in @xcite .",
    "the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix , @xmath30 , are the principal components , with eigenvalues @xmath31 giving the contribution to the total variance in the direction of @xmath1 . using the @xmath1 as basis axes ( instead of the @xmath22 )",
    "essentially rotates the coordinate system in the ( 42-dimensional , for millennium ) space .",
    "the @xmath1 can have any length , and arbitrary sign ; we normalize the @xmath1 to length  1 , and choose the sign convention that the sum @xmath32 is positive .",
    "we order the @xmath1 so that @xmath33 contributes the most to the total variance , and then @xmath34 , etc .",
    ", i.e. for the associated variances , @xmath35 , and so on .",
    "every galaxy s history @xmath36 corresponds to a set of @xmath37 coefficients ( @xmath38 ) of the @xmath1 , @xmath39 we will choose @xmath37 and @xmath1 to be dimensionless .",
    "these modes can be thought of roughly as akin to fourier modes , for fluctuations around an average galaxy stellar mass history , with the @xmath37 similar to fourier coefficients .",
    "however , the shapes of the modes ( the @xmath1 ) also contain information , as they are determined by the combined properties of the members of the sample whose fluctuations they describe .",
    "[ fig:3pcshape ] shows @xmath40 for the @xmath41 stellar mass histories of millennium sample galaxies with @xmath42 .",
    "this set of galaxies will be our fiducial sample for examples below . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3pcshape ] , the colour corresponds to the full @xmath27 : @xmath43 a rewriting of eq .",
    "[ eq : distdef ] .",
    "that is , @xmath40 are directly visible , while the colour includes the size of the remaining contribution from @xmath44 .",
    "the median @xmath27 is @xmath45 , while its average is @xmath46 .",
    "its distribution has a long tail , as seen by the `` mass '' range in fig .",
    "[ fig:3pcshape ] .",
    "distribution is dominated by galaxies with very large jumps in stellar mass near or at the final time .",
    "discarding or keeping the 20 or fewer galaxies per sample with @xmath27 larger than 10 times the sample variance changes the sample total variance , fraction of variance due to @xmath33 , and correlations discussed later by a few percent or ( usually ) less .",
    "the leading principal component @xmath33 is essentially unchanged . as the source of the stellar mass jumps is unclear , and their effects minimal",
    ", we include these galaxies in our analysis below . ] the average @xmath47 is shown in table [ tab : samprops ] for all samples .    the rewriting in eq .",
    "[ eq : mstarpc ] holds for any change of basis , not just the @xmath1 chosen to diagonalize the covariance matrix .",
    "however , because the @xmath1 are principal components , the @xmath48 have zero covariance for @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "a quantity we will also use later is the signed fraction of @xmath27 due to @xmath1 for a given galaxy , i.e. @xmath51 the @xmath52 indicate how much each particular @xmath53 contributes to a galaxy s @xmath27 , its separation from the average history .",
    "a galaxy with @xmath54 for instance , is proportional to @xmath33 , but can have an arbitrary @xmath27 ( @xmath55 ) from the average history .",
    "tracking issues motivated us to modify the above procedure for the owls stellar mass histories .",
    "the stellar masses of millennium galaxies do not decrease between time steps , however in the owls models , 75% of the agn+sn and 50% of the sn only histories had stellar mass loss at one or more step , and 49/800 ( agn+sn ) and 18/800 ( sn only ) galaxies lost over half of their mass between two consecutive steps .",
    "this latter huge mass loss seems to be due the way stellar mass is assigned to galaxies when a galaxy changes from a central to a satellite galaxy and back again .",
    "we dropped these histories with the most extreme mass loss ( i.e.  50 per cent or more ) in computing and ordering the principal components , but then included all galaxies to calculate the variance due to each principal component .",
    "( this occasionally leads the fraction of variance due to a @xmath1 to increase with @xmath56 . )    for the millennium samples , we also briefly compare pca results for stellar mass histories with their counterparts for galaxy halo histories , star formation rate histories and specific star formation rate histories .",
    "we modified how we applied pca for these histories in the following ways and for the following reasons .",
    "a first change is that these other histories are not rescaled to be identical at @xmath0 .",
    "the rescaling of stellar mass histories to get the same @xmath0 stellar mass in each sample was to remove the effects of finite bin size in our samples , i.e. fluctuations due to slight changes in final stellar mass .",
    "in contrast , for each essentially fixed final stellar mass sample , the differences in final halo masses , star formation rates and specific star formation rates are all physical properties of interest .",
    "a second change was the use of logarithms for halo mass .",
    "as halo histories have a very large spread in final halo mass values , those with large final mass heavily dominate the principal components .",
    "this is somewhat improved by using @xmath57 .",
    "( in part this difficulty did not arise for stellar mass because we worked with samples sharing essentially the same final stellar mass .",
    "we could have used @xmath58 for stellar mass histories as well , but chose not to because it tends to emphasize the early times of histories which are more sensitive to resolution effects and less related to final time observables of interest to us . )",
    "in addition , halo mass histories for galaxies which switch from central to satellite and back again , or are more than 3 times the root mean square @xmath59 from the median are excluded when finding the halo bases @xmath60 in order for the components to represent most of the histories rather than the large remaining outliers .",
    "we include all haloes when calculating the @xmath60 contributions to the variance .",
    "this leads to the non - monotonic behaviour with @xmath60 seen for some of the @xmath56 values in fig .",
    "[ fig:3pctypes ] below .",
    "another subtlety of halo histories is that , in simulations , the halo mass of a satellite is fixed to be the halo mass right before it became a satellite .",
    "these constant satellite halo masses and the fact that some galaxies switch from central to satellite and back several times tend to complicate interpretation . as a result , while we will mention some results below , we will not consider these histories in as much depth as the stellar mass histories . note that @xcite considered halos rather than galaxy halos and thus did not encounter these issues , which are associated with subhalos , not halos .",
    "we now discuss the properties of the pca classification of the galaxy stellar mass histories . as pca concerns fluctuations around the origin in a 42 or 20-dimensional space for our samples , for each sample we start by showing the origin ( the average stellar mass history ) .",
    "we then turn to the shape of each sample s distribution around the origin ( @xmath31 of each of the @xmath1 ) , touching upon the @xmath1 contributions for the halo mass , star formation rate and specific star formation rate counterparts .",
    "we comment briefly on the accuracy of approximating galaxy histories with a certain number of @xmath1 ( covered in more depth in the appendix ) , and the properties of the @xmath1 , and @xmath33 in particular , as functions of time .",
    "the average histories for all samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : avhist ] , rescaled by their final stellar mass to allow easier intercomparison .",
    "these curves are each the origins in their respective ( 42 or 20-dimensional ) spaces spanned by their pca @xmath1 . also shown , for reference , are the corresponding stellar mass histories of galaxies on the star forming main sequence with the same final stellar mass , inferred from observational data and using different assumptions than the simulations , by @xcite ( amended eq .",
    "a3 , shown in his fig .  9 ) .",
    "the average histories for the two higher final stellar mass samples grow more quickly at late times than a galaxy on the star forming main sequence , presumably due to higher than main sequence star formation rates , stellar mass gain through mergers , or some difference between the millennium models and the assumptions for the inferred histories from observation .",
    "these two higher final stellar mass bins also exhibit other differences in their histories from those with lower stellar mass , as will be seen later .",
    "the fraction of the variance @xmath31 due to each @xmath1 characterizes the ensemble of stellar mass histories .",
    "as seen in table [ tab : samprops ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pcfrac ] , the leading three @xmath1 contribute a significant fraction , @xmath61 , of the total variance around the average history , with @xmath33 strongly dominating ( note that the y - axis is logarithmic ) . , and moves the peak position of @xmath33 slightly , the inner product of the truncated and full @xmath33 is 1.00 . ] for the millennium histories this means the remaining @xmath62 of the variance is split among the remaining 39 @xmath1 , for the owls histories this fraction of the variance is shared amongst the remaining 17 @xmath1 .",
    "the predominance of @xmath33 is also indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3pcshape ] by the much larger range of values for the @xmath63 distribution , relative to @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    for some context and comparison , fig .",
    "[ fig:3pctypes ] shows the principal component contributions for the millennium stellar mass histories of fig .",
    "[ fig : pcfrac ] again , but now alongside their counterparts for the star formation rate and @xmath57 ( as described earlier , recall @xmath57 is used due to the large halo mass range ) for the same samples .",
    "the star formation rate histories are not dominated by the first few principal components : on average less than half of the total variance is due to the first three @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast , just as for the stellar mass histories , the halo mass histories are strongly dominated by the first few principal components . on average 87 per cent of the total variance is due to the first three @xmath60 .",
    "this fraction of the variance changes noticeably with sample , perhaps in part due to differences in their satellite fractions ( table [ tab : samprops ] ) .",
    "again , the scatter up and down for @xmath67 , especially apparent in the highest mass samples , happens because the @xmath60 are calculated ( and assigned an order ) with a subset of the galaxies , as described at the end of  [ sec : defpca ] , while the full set of galaxies is used to compute their variance contributions .",
    "we also considered the specific star formation rate ( not shown for brevity ) .",
    "its principal component fractional contributions to the variance fall between those for star formation rate and stellar mass in fig .",
    "[ fig:3pctypes ] , with the first three components contributing on average 3/4 of the variance . for higher @xmath56 components ,",
    "the specific star formation rate contributions are close to those for @xmath57 for the three lowest final stellar mass samples ( @xmath68 ) . for @xmath69",
    ", the higher @xmath56 specific star formation rate principal components contributions tended to be much higher than for @xmath70 halo mass . for all final stellar mass samples",
    ", the fraction of the variance due to the @xmath56th principal component for specific star formation rate drops below that for stellar mass around @xmath71 .",
    "in addition to studying contributions to the total scatter of the sample , the @xmath31 , one can also ask about contributions to individual galaxy histories , in particular how well keeping only a small number of @xmath1 modes in the expansion shown in eq .  [",
    "eq : mstarpc ] approximates individual galaxy stellar mass histories .",
    "once a galaxy stellar mass history is approximated by about 20 @xmath1 , 95% of galaxies are within @xmath72 of their true history , and within 10% of their true @xmath27 .",
    "see the appendix for figures showing more detailed trends for how these approximations work as final stellar mass and number of @xmath1 are varied .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath1 themselves as functions of redshift .",
    "the leading three @xmath1 for the fiducial sample ( where they account for 91% of the variance ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : first3 ] .",
    "again , this is the millennium @xmath73 sample .",

    ", there is a lot of `` ringing '' at the highest redshifts , with large amplitudes ( but with small coefficients @xmath37 ) .",
    "the extrema are spaced more regularly in lookback time than in redshift .",
    "regularity was also seen by @xcite when using the scale factor @xmath76 as time coordinate for their halo history principal components .",
    "they mentioned the similarity to fourier modes , although unlike fourier decomposition , with the pca expansion both the coefficients and the basis components ( i.e. basis modes ) are determined by the sample .",
    "and specific star formation rate are larger at high redshift , as compared to stellar mass and star formation rate , the largest variations in @xmath77 and @xmath78 occur at significantly higher redshift than for @xmath33 and @xmath79 , respectively . ]",
    "the leading component , @xmath33 , dominates the variance , and as will be seen below , many of the individual galaxy histories as well .",
    "[ fig : pc0comp ] shows @xmath33 as a function of redshift for all 8 samples .",
    "the data points are the simulation output redshifts , whose spacing provides an implicit weighting for @xmath27 . to allow easier visual comparison between @xmath33 for the owls and millennium models , we multiplied @xmath33 for owls by @xmath80 , to compensate for its smaller number ( 20 ) of output times compared to millennium ( 42 ) .",
    "we see that although @xmath33 is dominant and has a single peak in all cases , differences appear as final stellar mass and simulation are varied .",
    "the smoothness of the leading @xmath1 , in particular @xmath33 , allows us to use linear interpolation to intercompare them between simulations with different numbers of output times .",
    "@xmath33 is similar amongst the four lowest @xmath81 millennium samples and the agn+sn owls sample , as well as amongst the two higher @xmath81 samples and the sn only owls sample . within these groups",
    "inner products are @xmath82 , but between the two groups they can drop to 0.91 .",
    "vectors for different samples are fluctuations around different average histories .",
    "the next leading @xmath83 are also very close within the lowest four and within the two highest @xmath81 millennium samples . for these the agn+sn owls sample",
    "again has much higher overlap with the lower four , while the sn only owls sample has larger overlap with the higher two . ]",
    "the notable feature in @xmath33 is its peak , which is at lower redshift for the two highest @xmath81 millennium samples and the sn only owls sample , but at approximately the same redshift for the lower @xmath81 samples and the agn+sn owls sample .",
    "the two owls samples share the same final stellar mass as the fiducial sample , one of the lower @xmath81 samples .",
    "the difference between the two owls samples is probably due to overcooling in the sn only case , leading to too much late time star formation as compared to observations .",
    "( the source of the difference between higher and lower final stellar masses is less clear , but possibly related to the increased importance of mergers for the former . )",
    "thus we see how the behaviour of @xmath33 discriminates between families of histories with different physics and ( sometimes ) with different final stellar mass . in summary",
    ", @xmath33 dominates the stellar mass histories for all the different samples , and the first three @xmath1 capture @xmath1090% of the variance of the full sample .",
    "in addition ( see appendix for further discussion ) , a large fraction of individual galaxy stellar mass histories can be well approximated by a subset of the @xmath1 .",
    "the leading @xmath33 has one feature , a peak , and is similar for the @xmath84 millennium samples and the agn+sn owls sample .",
    "a different @xmath33 seems to be shared between the two higher @xmath81 millennium samples and the sn only owls sample , peaking at a lower redshift . the halo history ( which is somewhat more difficult to interpret ) pca shows similar dominance of the leading few components , while that for the specific star formation rate histories is slightly weaker .",
    "star formation rate histories require many more principal components to get a similar fraction of the variance compared to the stellar mass case .",
    "the pca decomposition revealed that a few parameters characterize a large fraction of the total deviation from the average stellar mass history for the ensemble of histories , and that a large fraction of each galaxy s history is captured by the leading @xmath1 .",
    "we now look for relations of the pca characterizations with other galaxy properties , in particular their halo histories , specific halo and stellar mass history times , and observables at a fixed time ( in our case @xmath0 ) .",
    "we start with @xmath85 , the fraction of a galaxy s history due to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 corresponds to a @xmath33 contribution with earlier stellar mass gain than the average history , and @xmath88 to later stellar mass gain than the average history .",
    "one interesting history to consider in terms of the leading fluctuation , @xmath33 , is the observationally derived history of a galaxy on the star forming main sequence ( @xcite , shown in fig .",

    "the higher final stellar mass samples often have weaker correlations of these times with @xmath63 , which is likely a combination of @xmath63 not being as dominant ( for all measurements ) and star formation perhaps not being as major a component of stellar mass gain .",

    "we now turn to relations between @xmath63 and several @xmath0 observables , to explore the relation between pca characterizations of stellar mass histories and possible fixed time measurements . for final time",
    "observable quantities , we took @xmath57 , @xmath132 ( for a satellite this is the mass of the main halo in which it is a satellite , rather than its subhalo mass ) , star formation rate ( sfr ) , g - r colour ( sdss , with dust ) and bulge / all stellar mass ratio .",

    "is also correlated with higher halo mass and host halo mass .",
    "again , correlations are weaker for the two highest stellar mass samples , for the reasons given above . for the two lowest final stellar mass samples ( @xmath133 ) , @xmath12 and @xmath63 have a negative correlation ( satellites cause the correlation between @xmath63 and @xmath13 to remain positive ) . for these , then , the higher the halo mass , the later the stellar mass gain , reversing as final stellar mass increases . another feature ( not shown )",
    "is that for all but the highest stellar mass sample , a large @xmath134 is strongly correlated with a large bulge / all stellar mass ratio .",
    "to summarize , the sign of the contribution to @xmath33 corresponds to a history component with early or late stellar mass growth , and the signed fractional contribution of @xmath33 , @xmath85 , is often large and negative for the observationally derived star forming main sequence in terms of the bases found for the millennium samples .",
    "this fractional contribution and the total contribution @xmath63 of @xmath33 in millennium are both strongly correlated with @xmath0 colour ( g - r ) and star formation , as well as @xmath135 and other galaxy halo and stellar mass history times .",
    "increasing the bulge / all stellar mass ratio often correlated with an increase in the total deviation from the average history not due to the first three @xmath1 .",
    "again , differences appeared between the lower four and upper two @xmath81 samples , which may be in part related to the fact that @xmath33 is less dominant for the latter .",
    "although smooth trends with @xmath63 can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : histcorr ] and  [ fig : obscorr ] , it is also clear that a separation into different classes appears when one considers @xmath85 , the fraction of a galaxy s total deviation from the average history , @xmath27 , due to @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pc0props ] ) . in this case , three populations seem to be present , with trends between the populations implied by the correlations in figs .",
    "[ fig : histcorr ] and  [ fig : obscorr ] .",
    "however , splitting up the sample of galaxies according to the @xmath33 contribution implies that galaxies with late stellar mass gain are all related to a form of fluctuation that is the mirror image of those of galaxies with early stellar mass gain ( i.e. both proportional to @xmath33 ) .",
    "one can use a more flexible characterization to divide up galaxy histories , by associating each galaxy with one ( or more ) of several different average paths or classes , rather than with symmetric fluctuations around a single central average history .",
    "we considered two ways of finding such paths , mixture models and k - means clustering .",
    "these do not assume that different basis histories are `` orthogonal '' and thus can allow more general basis histories , if preferred by the data .",
    "mixture models model the full distribution ( of stellar mass histories , in this case ) with a combination of several distributions , each here taken to be the same functional form but with different parameters .",
    "we took gaussian distributions ( a common choice ) as our basis distributions , each with a different average stellar mass history and different scatters .",
    "k - means clustering partitions objects into sets , with each object assigned to the set with the closest centre ( in this case the closest average history ) , but does not assume a form for the distribution of galaxy stellar mass histories around each centre . in both , one has to choose the number of components and provide initial guesses for centres .",
    "one then solves iteratively for better centres and corresponding galaxy assignments to each component ( and , for mixture models , for improved scatters and weights in the full distribution ) .",
    "we used mixture models based on the first 20 @xmath1 coefficients @xmath136 ( see appendix for how well this approximation works in the millennium samples ) .",
    "mixture models based on @xmath36 tended to become numerically unstable due to the large powers in the 41 dimensional determinant of the gaussian scatters .",
    "the initial paths were taken to be a range of functions of the leading @xmath1 .",
    "for the k - means clustering , each galaxy history @xmath36 is assigned to the @xmath137th average path @xmath138 for which @xmath139 is the smallest . using",
    "@xmath36 directly was stable for k - means clustering , so we used the full histories ( rather than the first 20 @xmath1 coefficients as was the case for the mixture models ) .",
    "the initial @xmath138 , where @xmath137 runs over the number of components , were chosen randomly from the galaxy distributions ; once galaxies are assigned to average paths , the averages are recalculated , and the process reiterated .",
    "both search methods converge to local solutions , so we checked for robustness by finding the best parameters for 9/10 of the sample ( training sample ) , then testing this solution on the remaining 1/10 ( test sample ) , and repeating this 9 times . we found that increasing the number of average paths tended to increase the likelihood of the test sample , even up to @xmath140 basis histories ( the only exception was a hint of an upturn in the likelihood for the @xmath141 sample , in one approximation , with 13 components ) .",
    "however , with increasing numbers of components , the interpretations of the resulting sub - populations became more complicated .",
    "although it is possible that the separate classes might be distinguishing between further galaxy properties , given the relative success of the pca description ( galaxy histories tend to be centred at the average history , with a large fraction of the variance in the first fluctuation ) , we focussed primarily on the 3 component models for further study .",
    "for the lowest @xmath142 final stellar mass sample , the preferred k - means and gaussian mixture model average paths coincide for both 3 and 4 components . as final stellar mass increases",
    ", the mixture models often find average paths which overlap significantly with each other but have different scatter , suggesting that the gaussian shape is not optimal ( as the procedure is then approximating a distribution with a narrow peak plus a large tail ) . associating",
    "a galaxy with a large or small width gaussian seemed a less useful classification than identifying the closest average history , as found using k - means .",
    "we thus report the k - means results in more depth below .    for the fiducial sample ,",
    "the 3 component k - means average histories are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kpaths ] .",
    "the black solid , red dotted , and cyan solid lines correspond to the k - means average paths , the @xmath143 .",
    "individual k - means average paths have a large overlap with the average history ( dotted magenta ) or @xmath86 ( dashed magenta ) .",
    "the @xmath85 of the upper and lower k - means histoires has absolute value @xmath14496% for all samples .",
    "in addition , on average over 90% of the galaxies in the lowest ( highest ) k - means group have @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "smaller corresponding fractions occur for @xmath147 and @xmath148 but the trends are the same . thus the @xmath86 fluctuations actually do seem to be good basis vectors for classifying the full set of histories , even when an orthogonal basis is not imposed . however , for the 4 lower final stellar mass samples , the k - means history associated with @xmath149 has a coefficient @xmath63 much larger than the coefficient @xmath63 for the k - means history associated with @xmath94 , with the trend reversing for the 2 highest final stellar mass samples .",
    "that is , the early and late stellar mass gain k - means average histories , although both related to @xmath86 , are not direct reflections of each other .",
    "the fraction of galaxies in the lowest and highest k - means histories , for all samples , is listed in table [ tab : samprops ] under `` lowk''/``highk '' ; changes are seen with final stellar mass , but they were not simple to interpret .",
    "for the owls samples again galaxies which lost more than 50% of their stellar mass on one time step were not included in finding the k - means average paths",
    ". these classifications , in terms of basis paths and the fraction of galaxies associated with each path , may be further ways to distinguish and compare models .",
    "note that `` lowpc''/``highpc '' counts galaxies which have more than half of their @xmath27 due to @xmath33 , i.e. it is a property of how much of their deviation is due to @xmath33 , while `` lowk''/``highk '' distinguishes galaxies whose total deviation is further than a certain amount from the average path , irrespective of which fluctuations contribute .",
    "we next turn to final time , i.e.  @xmath0 , and halo history properties in the context of k - means classification . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pathsplit ] , we take the three k - means groups of galaxies from fig .",

    "the likelihood of being in a particular k - means set is very high , but for other measurements ( for example bulge / all ratio ) , histories can belong to several of the different k - means sets and yet yield very similar @xmath0 observables .",
    "the other stellar mass samples had similar behaviour , although for lower final stellar mass there were sometimes trends visible in the bulge / all contributions , and the trends with @xmath150 varied for the next highest final stellar mass sample ( the highest final stellar mass sample is very small , leading to a very noisy histogram ) . using a split based upon @xmath85 or @xmath63 gives similar results , as expected from the overlap of the populations mentioned above .",
    "to summarize , splitting up galaxy histories into 3 sets tended to give a set associated with the average history of the full sample , and sets with early and late stellar mass gain histories , whose average paths significantly overlap with the leading pca fluctuation @xmath33 .",
    "the separation into the three sets was similar to that implied by using contributions to the galaxy s history from @xmath33 .",
    "we identified how well specific values of some particular @xmath0 observables or halo history characteristic times implied a galaxy belonged to a particular k - means average path .",
    "for some particular measured values of certain galaxy properties , the corresponding galaxy s stellar mass history was highly likely to lie within one particular k - means subsample .",
    "we applied a standard classification tool , principal component analysis ( pca ) , to several collections of simulated stellar mass histories from the millennium simulation and from the owls project .",
    "this approach characterizes the full population of galaxy histories ending at a given stellar mass , as well as giving a new description of each galaxy history in the sample . as such",
    ", it provides quantitative and qualitative methods to describe `` how galaxies form '' ( in a given model ) , starting with the actual simulated galaxy histories .",
    "we considered simulated stellar mass histories for several different final stellar mass ( @xmath81 ) galaxy samples .",
    "for each , the distribution of histories tended to peak around a central value and one main perturbation ( change in history from average ) dominated the variance ( scatter ) of the ensemble of galaxy histories from the average . combining the fluctuations due to the first three leading perturbations accounted for @xmath1090% of the variance around the average stellar mass history .",
    "similar trends were seen for the halo mass histories , and the leading pca halo history and stellar mass history contributions were correlated for most of the millennium final stellar mass samples .",
    "star formation rate histories did not have the leading principal components dominate , while fractions of the variance due to specific star formation rate history principal components fall in between those for star formation rate and stellar mass for the first @xmath1020 components , then drop below both .    in terms of individual galaxies ,",
    "the leading perturbation from the average history corresponds to a particular form of either late ( leading perturbation with a minus sign ) or early ( with a plus sign ) stellar mass gain , relative to the average stellar mass history .",
    "the shape of the leading fluctuation is similar amongst the millennium lower final stellar mass samples ( @xmath151 ) and the owls agn+sn sample , and between the two millennium highest final stellar mass samples and the owls sn only simulation .",
    "thus this component can vary with changes in physics , and with final stellar masses within the same simulation .",
    "this characteristic property of a set of stellar mass histories can perhaps be used to intercompare them .",
    "this leading principal component also comprises a large fraction of many individual galaxy histories .",
    "we quantified how well using a given number of pca components approximates the millennium sample galaxy histories in the appendix .",
    "given the importance of the leading perturbation to the average history , we searched for and found correlations between its coefficient and several characteristic stellar mass history times , halo history times and final time observables in the millennium samples .",
    "we found in particular strong correlations with g - r colour and instantaneous star formation rate for the lower final stellar mass samples .",
    "for all but the highest final stellar mass sample , galaxies with large bulge / stellar mass ratios tended to have larger fluctuations from the average path which were not due to the leading few pca components .",
    "all millennium samples had large correlations of their amount of leading principal component with halo history times such as @xmath120 .",
    "the leading principal component also had , not surprisingly , large correlations with times where the stellar mass history reached some fixed fraction of its final value .",
    "going beyond a single average history plus its perturbations , we separated the galaxy histories into 3 classes using the contribution from the leading pca component , mixture models and k - means clustering . the resulting divisions of galaxies often were similar in terms of the resulting basis paths and in terms of the distribution of galaxies with a certain observable property .",
    "for instance , galaxies which are very red ( large g - r ) almost all have at least 50% of their @xmath27 , their separation squared from the average path , due to @xmath149 ( i.e. @xmath98 ) .",
    "this helps in gaining intuition for the classification found by these three methods and gives an idea of how well one can decode a galaxy s stellar mass history given these fixed time observations .",
    "the fractions of galaxies in these different classes changes between different final stellar masses and different models , and may also provide a point of comparison between them .",
    "all of these tools and quantities provide several ways to look at a full ensemble of galaxy stellar mass histories , such as are being produced by many different methods and groups .",
    "these ensembles of full histories answer `` how do galaxies form '' in any given model , by incorporating the consequences of all the modeling assumptions used to create them .",
    "going forward , the pca classification provides a simple characterization of the full set of galaxy histories , both in finding how much different perturbations contribute to the histories , and in the form of the perturbations themselves .",
    "histories generated with different methods or having different final stellar mass sometimes , but not always , exhibited different properties .",
    "the principal components can also be used to approximate galaxy histories using a small number of basis components .",
    "all of these features might be useful when exploring simplifying assumptions and models for galaxy formation .",
    "one could ask how these basis components , and the galaxy contributions from them , change as the models change .",
    "this is particularly straightforward in semi",
    "- analytic models ( including highly simplified versions such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , where the dark matter remains unchanged . differences between families of histories , using this classification , could be easily generated and compared .",
    "more specifically , quantities for comparison include the total variance , the ( fractional ) variance due to @xmath33 and in the leading components , the shape of @xmath33 or other @xmath1 , the number of galaxies with large or small , raw or fractional contributions from @xmath33 , the average paths found using k - means clustering or mixture models , the distributions of galaxies into the k - means sets , and their counterparts for say central or satellite galaxies , and other subsamples .",
    "analogues for other histories such as halo mass ( although subhalos cause complications ) and specific star formation rate may also be of use .",
    "once a family of stellar mass histories is in hand , calculation of the principal components and the k - means sets is straightforward and quick ( mixture models are more complicated in part because they encode more information , in particular the shape of the distribution around the average histories ) .",
    "one further step is to tie these descriptions of histories more closely to observations . for simulations which report observable properties ,",
    "these stellar mass history classifications provide points of contact between them and the full set of galaxy stellar mass histories .",
    "( the observable properties we considered were not comprehensive , using more colours , for instance is a direct generalization . )",
    "we explored these briefly , including the effects of changing final stellar mass .",

    "as the leading few @xmath1 capture a large part of the variance of each sample relative to the average history , one can also ask how well using only a small number of @xmath1 can approximate individual galaxy histories .",
