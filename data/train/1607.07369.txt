    "@xcite provided a comprehensive review of meteoroid streams possibility associated with dormant comets based on the similarity between their orbits , but a comprehensive contemporary `` cued '' survey to look for all possible weak streams from the large number of recently discovered acos / neos that may have had weak past activity , including formation of early meteoroid trails , is yet to be performed .    in this work , we present a survey for dormant comets in the aco component in the neo population through the meteoroid streams they might have produced during their active phase , using the most complete cmor dataset available to date .",
    "the survey is performed in a `` cued search '' manner rather than a commonly - used blind search : we first identify eligible acos ( i.e. with well - determined orbits suitable for long - term integration ) in the neo population (   2 ) , then simulate the formation and evolution of the meteoroid trails produced by such acos assuming they have recently been active (   3 ) , and then search the cmor data using the virtual shower characteristics to identify `` real '' streams now visible at the earth (   4 ) .",

    "these 407 acos in the neo population represent possible dormant comets which may have produced meteoroid streams in the recent past .",

    "for each virtual stream , we assign @xmath24 being the cmor detection efficiency , as    @xmath25    there remain four unknown variables : @xmath16 , @xmath20 , @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",

    "the number of test meteoroids making the cmor - detectable virtual meteor shower ( not the total simulated test meteoroids which is @xmath49 ) at this stage is typically @xmath50 and is at least 100 . the virtual meteoroid shower flux for each parent",
    "is then calculated using eq .",
    "[ eq : met - flux ] and  [ eq : met - flux - cmor ] .",
    "the detection limit for multi - year cmor data is of the order of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "hence , we only consider virtual showers with @xmath52 as cmor - detectable showers .",
    "readers may immediately notice that , for a significant fraction of the objects , the calculated @xmath20 is beyond the typical chaotic timescale of jfcs ( @xmath53  yrs , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "here it is important to note that our approach focuses at the _ mean  orbit _ rather than the exact position of the parent ; therefore we are to examine the chaotic timescale of the orbit instead of the parent . for each object , we generate 100  clones from the covariance matrix of the orbital elements and integrate them backward in time . similar to the definition of @xmath20 , we define the parental orbital chaotic timescale @xmath54 as the time taken for the median @xmath34-parameter of any two clones to grow beyond 0.1 .",
    "thus , @xmath54 corresponds to the time that the parent orbit is well constrained and the associated meteoroid stream can therefore be simulated with confidence .",
    "the value of @xmath20 should be viewed cautiously if @xmath55 .    following this procedure ,",
    "we identify 44 objects that meet both our visibility and detection criteria , and that the stream formation process have the potential of producing cmor - detectable meteor activity between 2002 and 2015 .",
    "note that no geographic constraint is considered at this stage ; i.e. southerly virtual radiants are still included .",

    "the calculated radiants and arrival speeds agree with observations within uncertainties , providing some basic validation of the meteoroid modeling approach .",
    "in particular , we note that the calculated stream ages ( @xmath20 ) are 300  yr for quadrantids and 6100  yr for the 2004 tg@xmath56 component in the taurid complex , consistent with previous findings ( 200  yr for quadrantids and @xmath57  yr for taurids , e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ) . the modeled flux for the taurids , however , is about 100 times higher than observations , likely related to the formation mechanism of the taurids not being purely sublimation - driven ( c.f .",

    "meteor activity is classified into two categories : annual showers , which are visible every year at more or less the same time and rate ; and outbursts , which are enhancements visible in some years but not others .",
    "this divide plainly reflects the evolution of the meteoroid cloud : recently - formed meteoroid _ trails _ experience little differential effects due to radiation pressure and planetary perturbation , and thus tend to remain concentrated in a narrow arc in the orbit and only become visible as meteor outbursts when this `` knot '' of denser material impacts the earth . after some time",
    ", differential effects gradually stretch the trail along the entire orbit into a meteoroid _ stream _ , visible as an annual meteor shower every time the earth arrives at the stream intersection point . outbursts from young trails provide clues to the ejection state ( epoch , particle ejection speed , etc . ) of the trails , such as the case of 55p / tempel - tuttle and the leonids ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast , more highly evolved streams are useful for the estimation of the age of the entire stream , such as the case of 109p / swift - tuttle and the perseids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it should be emphasized that the statistical test only addresses the likelihood of finding a better parent body match for a given stream orbit ; it does not take into account the false positives in shower identification , a complicated issue heavily investigated for half a century ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* and many others ) .",
    "there exists a danger of assigning a small body as the `` parent '' of some random fluctuation in the meteoroid background .",
    "this is especially true for unestablished showers , as most of them have been observed by only one observer .      among the predictions given in table",
    "[ tbl : can - met - ob ] , only one prediction is associated with a distinct detection : the event from ( 139359 ) 2001 me@xmath2 in 2006 ( figure  [ fig : wav-139359 ] ,  [ fig : cmor-139359 - 2006 ] and table  [ tbl : cmor-139359 - 2006 ] ) .",
    "the association is of high statistical significance , as @xmath122 . from the wavelet profile",
    ", we estimate that the observed flux is close to the detection threshold or @xmath123 , as the signal is not very significantly higher than the background fluctuation . the event ,",
    "if indeed associated with ( 139359 ) 2001 me@xmath2 , should have originated from a relatively recent ( @xmath124  yr ) ejection event . since the observed",
    "flux is about the same order as the model prediction , it can be estimated that the dust production associated to the ejection is comparable to the average dust production of known near - earth jfcs .",
    "curiously , the annual shower associated with ( 139359 ) 2001 me@xmath2 , though with a moderate expected flux , is not detected .",
    "this may suggest that the ejection was a transient event rather than a prolonged one , possibly similar to the activity of 107p/(4015 ) wilson - harrington upon its discovery in 1949 ( c.f . * ? ? ? * ) .    another interesting aspect of our survey is the negative detection of several strong predicted events ( with @xmath125 ) .",
    "these can be used to place a tight constraint on the past dust production of the parent .",
    "it can be concluded that the dust production of 2001 ha@xmath126 , 2012 to@xmath121 and 2015 tb@xmath127 are either at least 2 magnitudes lower than the median near - earth jfc model or have a much steeper dust size distribution than we assume .      with the results discussed above ,",
    "we now revisit the population statistics of the dormant comets .",
    "we first consider the number of streams detectable by cmor , @xmath128 , to be expressed as    @xmath129    where @xmath130 is the true ( de - biased ) number of dormant comets in the neaco population , @xmath131 is the detection efficiency of the neacos ( i.e. the number of known neacos divided by the number of total neacos predicted by neo population model ) , @xmath132 is the selection efficiency of neacos that produce visible meteor showers ( i.e. the number of shower - producing neacos divided by the total number of neacos ) , and @xmath24 is the detection efficiency of cmor ( i.e. the number of total virtual showers observable by cmor divided by the total number of virtual showers visible at the earth ) . rearranging the terms , we have    @xmath133    we focus on annual shower detection in the following as the statistics for outburst detection ( only 1 ) is too low . as presented above , we have @xmath134 for @xmath100 population and @xmath135 for @xmath136 population . for the remaining three coefficients :    1 .   for @xmath131 , we obtain the true ( de - biased ) number of neacos by using @xcite s neo population model and incorporate the population statistics from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we derive @xmath137 for @xmath100 and @xmath138 for @xmath136 . considering that we have selected 407 neacos in our initial sample ,",
    "of which 199 are bodies with @xmath100 , we obtain @xmath139 for @xmath100 and @xmath140 for @xmath136 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath132",
    ", we have 44 hypothetical showers as listed in table  [ tbl : can - met - ev ] , among which 15 are from @xmath100 bodies .",
    "this yields @xmath141 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath24",
    ", we exclude the meteoroid streams whose are either too slow for reliable radar detection ( @xmath142 * ? ? ? * ) or have radiants too far south for cmor to detect ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "this leaves 36 streams in table  [ tbl : can - met - ev ] , including 14 originating from @xmath100 bodies .",
    "this translates to @xmath144 .    with all these numbers ,",
    "we obtain @xmath145 for @xmath100 population and @xmath146 for @xmath136 population , with uncertainties derived by error propagation .",
    "this translates to a fraction of @xmath147 of dormant comets in the neaco population independent of size . assuming dormant comets in asteroidal orbits ( i.e. @xmath148 bodies ) are negligible",
    ", we further derive a dormant comet fraction of @xmath0 for the entire neo population , which should be considered as a lower limit .",
    "this number is at the low end of previous estimates by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who give ranges of 2@xmath149 .",
    "it should be noted that all these authors also assume that dormant comets in asteroidal orbits are negligible during the derivation of the dormant comet fraction .",
    "there are two caveats in our work that may lead to an underestimation of the dormant comet fraction .",
    "since we used the median of the dust production of _ known _ jfcs to feed the meteoroid flux model , if the actual jfc dust production is in fact lower , our treatment will lead to an overestimation of the number of visible showers , which will in turn reduce the derived dormant comet fraction . for a dormant comet fraction of @xmath150",
    ", we need to reduce @xmath132 by a factor of @xmath151 , equivalent to using a dust production model that is 10 times lower than the current median model .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the recent trend that more weakly - active comets are being discovered as more sensitive neo surveys become operational .",
    "another caveat is that the actual dust size distribution @xmath40 may be different than what is used in the dust model .",
    "a steeper size distribution will result in a proportionally larger number of smaller meteoroids , making the stream more dispersed and hence more difficult to be detected .",
    "this hypothesis is not supported by reported cometary observations which are found to have @xmath152 at @xmath153-range sizes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a discrepancy between millimeter to sub - millimeter - sized meteoroids is possible , such as the case of 21p / giacobini - zinner and the draconids @xcite .",
    "another fundamental question is , are dormant comets in asteroidal orbits really negligible",
    "? there is at least one prominent counter - example : ( 3200 ) phaethon ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "phaethon is associated with the geminid meteor shower and still possesses some outgassing activity at perihelion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the fact that we do not see a lot of active neas suggests that such objects may not be very common .",
    "taking the median dynamical lifetime of near - earth jfcs to be a few @xmath155  yr , the derived dormancy rate translates to a dormancy probability of @xmath1 per comet independent of sizes .",
    "this is consistent with previous model predictions , and about 540 times lower than the disruption probability @xcite .",
    "this result echoes earlier suggestions that near - earth jfcs are more likely to be disrupted rather than achieving dormancy @xcite .",
    "since the typical timescale for jfc disruption , a jfc s dynamical lifetime in the neo region , and dispersion lifetime for a resulting meteoroid stream are all at the same order ( a few @xmath155  yr ) , there should exist a significant number of meteoroid streams with parents that are either disrupted or have been dynamically removed such that no parent can be found , supporting the speculation of @xcite that many meteoroid streams are produced from disrupted comets . since disruption and dynamical removal are competing mechanisms to eliminate jfcs from the neo region , it may be difficult to investigate the formation of these `` orphan '' streams in the absence of an observable parent .",
    "finally , we compare our list against the dormant comet candidates proposed in previous works .",
    "the largest list of dormant candidates to - date is published by @xcite and includes 203 objects that resemble jfc orbits and match a set of restrictive criteria . according to our simulations , only 3 of these 203 objects have the potential of producing cmor - detectable activity [ ( 196256 ) 2003 eh@xmath2 , 1999 lt@xmath2 , and 2004 bz@xmath156 ;",
