    "relativistic shock waves are widely thought to generate energetic particles producing high - energy emission in many astrophysical sources .",
    "the example of such sources can be hot spots in radio galaxies , jets in blazars and in galactic  microquasars \" , gamma - ray burst sources , and pulsar winds .",
    "it is also believed that high - energy cosmic rays have their origin in astrophysical environments in which relativistic shocks occur .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the current status of cosmic ray acceleration theory at relativistic shock waves and to briefly review and comment on the models proposed for ultra - high - energy cosmic ray production at such shocks .",
    "the basic acceleration mechanism discussed in the context of cosmic ray production at shocks is the first - order fermi process .",
    "this process can be applied to sufficiently energetic particles , with gyroradii much larger than the shock thickness , defined by gyroradii of `` thermal '' ions present in the plasma .",
    "such energetic particles see the shock front as a sharp discontinuity in the plasma flow . in the following , we review the results obtained mainly in the test particle approach , in which the influence of accelerated particles on the physical conditions at the shock is not taken into account .    in the first - order fermi acceleration process particles gain their energies by consecutive crossings of the shock front . in order to do so",
    ", they have to be confined near the shock .",
    "the particle confinement is provided by the turbulent magnetic fields which perturb particle trajectories leading to particle diffusion in pitch - angle . during the acceleration process some fraction of particles transmitted downstream escapes from the vicinity of the shock .",
    "the competition between particle energy gains at shock interactions and the escape process determines the stationary particle spectrum , often of the power - low form .    in the case of a nonrelativistic shock , where the fluid speeds are much lower than the energetic particle velocity ,",
    "the resulting particle spectrum is independent of the background conditions near the shock , including the configuration of the regular magnetic field , the spectrum and the amplitude of mhd turbulence .",
    "this is mainly because of a nearly isotropic form of the particle distribution function at the shock , in the conditions where magnetic field perturbations near the shock are sufficient to ensure efficient particle scattering . in such conditions , the spectral index @xmath0 for the phase - space distribution function",
    "is given exclusively by the shock compression ratio @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is given in the shock normal rest frame , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the shock velocities with respect to the upstream and downstream plasma rest frames , respectively .",
    "the physical picture is much more complicated for relativistic shocks , where the shock velocity or its projection along the upstream mean magnetic field @xmath6 ( @xmath7  the upstream magnetic field inclination angle to the shock normal ) is comparable to the speed of light .",
    "the energetic particle distribution becomes anisotropic near the shock , and anisotropy increases with growing shock lorentz factor @xmath8 .",
    "this fact substantially influences the resulting particle spectrum , which is then very sensitive to the background conditions .",
    "studies of particle acceleration processes at mildly relativistic shock waves started with the works of @xcite and @xcite for parallel shocks ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "they showed that the spectral indices are different from the @xmath10 value obtained in the nonrelativistic case , and depend on the form of the wave power spectrum of the magnetic field perturbations ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "acceleration processes in oblique subluminal ( @xmath11 ) shock waves were analyzed by @xcite under the assumption of magnetic moment conservation for particles interacting with the shock .",
    "this assumption restricted validity of their considerations to the case of a weakly perturbed magnetic field , where cross - field diffusion does not play a significant role .",
    "they showed that in such conditions particle spectra can be even as flat as @xmath12 in cases where @xmath13 is close to the speed of light .",
    "this feature results from effective multiple reflections of anisotropically distributed upstream particles from the compressed field downstream of the shock .",
    "the feature discussed is also visible in fig .",
    "1 , which shows results of monte carlo particle simulations performed by @xcite . in the figure ,",
    "one may note the lack of results for superluminal ( @xmath14 ) shocks propagating in a weakly perturbed magnetic field .",
    "in such conditions , particles are tied to the field lines .",
    "therefore , the upstream particles can be only transmitted downstream with no possibility of returning to the shock , so the first - order fermi process does not operate in this case and the power - law particle spectrum can not be formed . nevertheless , because of anisotropy of particle distribution at a relativistic shock , particle energy gains in a transmission process can be much larger than those resulting from the adiabatic compression at the shock @xcite .    in the effectively accelerating astrophysical shocks",
    "one may expect large - amplitude mhd waves to occur .",
    "the role of such finite - amplitude magnetic field perturbations in forming a particle spectrum was investigated by a  number of authors using monte carlo simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the derived power - law particle spectra directly depend on the conditions near the shock",
    ". they can be either very steep or very flat for different configurations of the mean magnetic field with respect to the shock normal and different amplitudes of perturbations , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . note also , that the changes of the particle spectral index can be nonmonotonic with an increasing field perturbations amplitude @xcite . in the case of a highly perturbed magnetic field",
    ", power - law spectra can be formed for superluminal shocks .",
    "they are , however , very steep for mildly perturbed conditions at the shock .",
    "the first - order fermi process at ultrarelativistic shocks has been recently discussed by a number of authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this topic is of a great importance for gamma - ray burst external shocks astrophysics and uhecr generation in these sources .",
    "for @xmath15 the energetic particle distribution function is highly anisotropic at the shock in the upstream plasma rest frame .",
    "this stems from the fact that when a given particle crosses the shock upstream , its momentum direction has an opening angle around the shock normal @xmath16 , thus it is almost aligned with the shock propagation direction . in such conditions ,",
    "a small perturbation to the particle trajectory , provided by its momentum deflection in the upstream regular magnetic field or scattering off the mhd fluctuations , allows for its being overtaken by the shock and transmitted downstream . as a result ,",
    "the mean particle energy gain in a single acceleration loop upstream - downstream - upstream is @xmath17 @xcite , which restricts seriously the efficiency of the acceleration process .",
    "efficient particle acceleration is possible when particle distribution upstream is close to isotropy .",
    "however , such conditions can be met at the ultrarelativistic shock wave only at the particle first shock crossing .",
    "then , the mean energy gain for particles reflected from the shock is very large , @xmath18 , but it should be stressed that the expected efficiency of such reflection is rather low @xcite . as explained above , the conditions at the shock do not allow for particle distribution isotropization in subsequent shock crossings , even if a highly perturbed medium exists upstream of the shock .",
    "the important topic in the context of uhecr production at high-@xmath8 shock waves is the existence of the asymptotic spectral index for relativistic shock acceleration .",
    "all the above mentioned works on the first - order fermi process at such shocks yield consistent estimates of the accelerated particle spectral index @xmath19 , in the limit of the very high shock lorentz factors ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the models of the burst afterglow spectra often give results pointing to essentially the same value of @xmath0 for synchrotron radiating electrons , which is sometimes interpreted as observational confirmation of the correctness of theoretical models proposed for ultrarelativistic shock acceleration .",
    "however , in all discussed derivations there is explicit or implicit assumption of a highly turbulent conditions near the shock ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . it is uncertain whether such conditions are indeed met in astrophysical shocks . on the other hand , in conditions with medium - amplitude magnetic field perturbations ,",
    "particle spectra generated at oblique realistic shocks with @xmath21 can be much steeper than those obtained in the asymptotic limit , as seen in the simulations of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in such conditions , the shocks will be unable to efficiently accelerate particles in the first - order fermi process .",
    "the factors important for the first - order fermi processes at relativistic shocks are the presence and the configuration of the mean magnetic field , the structure of the turbulent field component , and also the presence of the long - wave magnetic field perturbations .",
    "the acceleration studies presented above apply very simple approaches for the modeling of the turbulent mhd medium near the shock .",
    "their perturbed magnetic field models either lack some of the factors mentioned above or take them into account in a very simplified way . in some models , the continuity of the perturbed field across the shock is also not preserved .",
    "this factor is , however , very important for the acceleration process since it can introduce the correlations in particle motion on both sides of the shock .",
    "there is thus a need for a more detailed analysis of the first - order fermi process at relativistic shocks , which would include all the important factors to yield the better insight into the real physical situation at the astrophysical shocks .",
    "an attempt at doing such analysis for mildly relativistic shocks has been recently performed by @xcite .",
    "we considered the first - order fermi process at shocks propagating in `` more realistically '' modeled perturbed magnetic fields .",
    "the model assumes a wide wavevector range turbulent field component with the power - law spectrum imposed on the uniform magnetic field component upstream of the shock .",
    "the continuity of the full perturbed field across the shock is preserved by the use of the respective shock jump conditions . in our modeling ,",
    "the particle spectra were derived with the method of monte carlo simulations by integrating particle trajectories in such magnetic field , with a hybrid method enabling to treat both long- and short - wave perturbations .     for ( a ) the flat and ( b ) the kolmogorov wave spectrum of the magnetic field turbulence .",
    "the upstream perturbation amplitude @xmath22 is given near the respective curves .",
    "linear fits to the spectra are also presented and values of the spectral indices @xmath0 are given .",
    "the spectra have vertical shifts for clarity .",
    "particles with energies in the range @xmath23 can effectively interact with the field perturbations . ]",
    "figure 2 summarizes the results for oblique superluminal shocks , where the particle spectra for the shock with @xmath24 @xmath25 are shown as an example .",
    "this is a representative example for relativistic shocks , because most field configurations in such shocks lead to analogous superluminal conditions @xcite .",
    "one can note that particle spectra diverge from a simple power law in the full energy range .",
    "for the small turbulence amplitude the particle spectrum is essentially the compressed upstream injected distribution .",
    "power - law sections in the spectra are produced at larger turbulence amplitudes , but in our simulations they are formed by a small number of particles .",
    "the spectra steepen with growing energy , but still within the resonance range , and are followed by the cutoffs .",
    "these features arise due to the finite wavevector range of the turbulence considered in the simulations . in the perturbed magnetic field with the limited dynamic range of field perturbations , scattering conditions vary with particle energy .",
    "low - energy particles have their resonance wavevectors close to the maximum wavevector value @xmath26 , so that most of the turbulence reside in the long - wave range for this particles .",
    "these long - wave , high - amplitude magnetic field perturbations form _ locally _ oblique , subluminal field configurations at the shock , which enable acceleration of particles interacting with the shock in the locally subluminal conditions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the acceleration process becomes less efficient for high - energy particles due to decreasing amount of the respective long waves for these particles , which results in the spectrum steepening and the cutoff .",
    "this feature is independent of the initial energy of particles injected at the shock @xcite , suggesting that actually the turbulent magnetic field structure does not allow for particle acceleration to higher energies .    from the above considerations it is evident that the critical component of any shock acceleration study is the applied model of the perturbed magnetic field near the shock .",
    "the real magnetic field structure and its generation mechanism at a relativistic shock front are poorly known .",
    "therefore , an understanding of these and other related issues ( e.g. , particle injection , the shock structure ) is the basic condition of reaching the real progress in the study of cosmic ray acceleration at relativistic shock waves .",
    "a noticeable advance in this field results from the application of particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , developed to study `` microphysical '' properties of relativistic shocks @xcite .",
    "as the theoretical considerations show @xcite , the turbulent magnetic field can be generated locally at the shock via relativistic two - stream ( weibel ) instability .",
    "the source and the mechanism of the field generation is kinetic in nature , as the instability is driven by the anisotropy of particle distribution function at the shock associated with a two - stream motion of the two plasma particle populations : the first formed by the upstream particles inflowing onto the shock front and the second composed of particles reflected from the shock . the more detailed insight into the dynamics of the weibel instability give us particle - in - cell simulations , in which two relativistic plasma collide with each other to form a shock .",
    "the structure of the small - scale strong turbulent magnetic field , generated downstream of the shock , is very complicated spatially and , in addition , changes with time .",
    "the field is predominantly transversal and the total magnetic energy becomes a substantial fraction of the equipartition field energy .",
    "the initial perturbations grow in size and the generated field structures are transported downstream . at the given point downstream of the shock and a given time long after collision , the power spectrum of the turbulent magnetic field is a power - law , with the most power concentrated at long wavelengths .",
    "the scales associated with the magnetic fields thus generated are , however , small compared to gyroradii of particles undergoing the first - order fermi acceleration .",
    "nonetheless , the magnetic field structure evolution is probably accompanied by plasma heating and non - thermal particle acceleration , thus possibly providing the seed particles for the fermi process .",
    "the pic simulations can be therefore treated as a first step towards understanding of processes important for the study of cosmic ray acceleration at relativistic shocks .    in summary ,",
    "the present theoretical knowledge of cosmic ray production at relativistic shocks is incomplete .",
    "existing theoretical models explain only some features of the observed cosmic rays . because of the strong dependence of particle spectra on conditions at the shock",
    ", the models do not allow for reliable modeling of astrophysical objects in which relativistic shock waves occur .",
    "further progress requires an increase in the number and the quality of observational data revealing the physical parameters near the shock . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a need for advance in theoretical studies , which most probably is to be made through advanced numerical simulations .",
    "particle - in - cell methods are appropriate to study the microphysics of relativistic shocks .",
    "realistic modeling of particle acceleration at astrophysical shocks has to incorporate results of such studies and by itself requires a full plasma nonlinear description .",
    "this should take into account appropriate boundary conditions , modification of the shock structure by backreaction of accelerated particles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and second - order acceleration processes .",
    "extragalactic astrophysical objects harboring relativistic shock waves are the likely sources of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays , with energies in the range @xmath27 ev . in the light of the apparent drawbacks in the theory of particle acceleration at relativistic shocks ,",
    "it is clear that it is now vary hard to judge with certainty which mechanism proposed for uhecr production is in fact responsible for the observational data on cosmic rays .",
    "nevertheless , it is worthy to comment on some proposals on this topic .",
    "fireball models of gamma - ray bursts assume the prompt burst emission in gamma rays to be produced at internal mildly relativistic shocks ( @xmath28 ) and the afterglow emission to originate at the blast wave propagating with initially ultrarelativistic velocity ( @xmath29 ) into the external medium ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the evidence for ultra - high - energy cosmic ray production at grb sources is based on two claimed coincidences @xcite .",
    "first , the constraints imposed on fireball model parameters , inferred from prompt gamma - ray and early afterglow observations , are similar to the constraints imposed on the shock in order to allow for proton acceleration to the energies above @xmath30 ev .",
    "second , energy generation rate in gamma rays by gamma - ray bursts is similar to the rate required to account for the uhecr energy density .",
    "the model of @xcite assumes cosmic ray acceleration to very high energies by the first - order fermi processes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at internal shocks .",
    "the claimed agreement of model estimates with the observed uhecr flux and spectrum is however based on an oversimplified assumption about the spectrum of accelerated protons , which is taken as the one derived for non - relativistic shocks , where @xmath10 .",
    "such assumption can not be justified for mildly relativistic shocks , where spectral indices are predicted to be much steeper in the most probably realized cases of superluminal shock configuration . moreover , the medium into which an internal shock propagates may be already modified , either by previous shell collisions , leading to a highly relativistic temperature of the upstream plasma , or by magnetic field amplification processes . in the latter case , the close to equipartition magnetic fields may occur near the shock , so that the magnetic field may play a non - negligible dynamical role .",
    "both effects lead to the steeper particle spectra than those obtained at unmodified shocks @xcite .",
    "note also , that in conditions of a highly turbulent close - to - equipartition fields near the relativistic shock the _ second - order _ acceleration processes may play a significant role in uhecr production @xcite , modifying the resulting particle spectrum .",
    "the proposal of uhecrs production at grb external ultrarelativistic shocks , based on a claimed evidence of the first - order fermi acceleration seen in burst afterglow data ( see sec .",
    "2 ) , was first advanced by @xcite .",
    "analysis performed by @xcite shows however , that the fermi process is inefficient in accelerating particles when the blast wave propagates in the galactic - like interstellar medium .",
    "the maximum energy a particle can gain in this case is @xmath31 ev .",
    "therefore , in order to reach higher particle energies , the acceleration process must operate in the region with much stronger magnetic fields . note , however , that the generation of high - energy particles at ultrarelativistic shocks probably requires the presence of long - wave field perturbations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even if a highly turbulent medium exists near the shock .",
    "ultra - high particle energies can be also reached at grb external shocks if there are energetic particles preexisting in the medium into which a blast wave propagates .",
    "these particles , when reflected from the shock , examine the @xmath32 energy boost .",
    "the particle reflection process is efficient if the energy density content in relativistic particles @xmath33 is sufficiently large , as the fraction of the blast wave energy that can go into boosting these particles to uhecr energies is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "cosmic rays of energy above @xmath35 ev ( sufficient to reach @xmath30 ev if @xmath36 ) in the galactic - like interstellar medium comprise only a very small fraction @xmath37 of the total ism energy density , and the reflection process can not account for the observed uhecrs , as indicated by @xcite .",
    "more promising scenario is when the fireball blast wave expands into the pulsar wind bubble .",
    "then , the bubble energy density is dominated by energetic ions , which can be boosted to uhecr energies with high efficiency . as shown in @xcite , spectra of the boosted ions",
    "are determined by the blast wave deceleration , and the evaluated spectral index is @xmath10 in this case .",
    "this leads to the uhecr spectrum compatible with observations .",
    "note , however , that predictions of the presented model are based on a number of assumptions about physical conditions which lead to the most efficient acceleration . to be considered seriously as the source of uhecrs",
    ", this mechanism should be modeled for definite realistic conditions , including the magnetic field structure in the pulsar wind bubble .",
    "the possible sites for uhecr production are also the hot spots of frii radio sources .",
    "these are believed to be the downstream regions of mildly relativistic shocks formed by interaction of relativistic jets with intergalactic medium .",
    "the model of cosmic ray production at hot spots was presented by @xcite , who assumed that protons are accelerated in the first - order fermi process at non - relativistic parallel shock . from comparison of the acceleration and the radiative loss time scales , they estimated @xmath38 to lie in the uhecr range .",
    "they show that in order to explain the observed uhecr flux , the particle spectral index at the shock must be on average @xmath39 or slightly flatter .",
    "although this is in agreement with recent results obtained on cosmic ray acceleration at mildly relativistic parallel shocks @xcite ( results for subluminal shocks may also apply given the typical hot spot shock speeds @xmath40 ) , the assumption made by rachen & biermann of the kolmogorov magnetic field turbulence downstream , extending up to the scales corresponding to gyroradii of the most energetic protons , may not be valid ( see sec .",
    "2 ) . moreover , it is not certain how much the finite size of the hot spots , and corresponding diffusive particle losses , influence the accelerated proton spectrum .",
    "authors estimates of the critical energy above which these losses lead to the spectrum cutoff give ( for a hot spot size @xmath41 kpc and the magnetic field @xmath42 mg ) @xmath43 ev for diffusion parallel to the mean magnetic field and @xmath44 ev for cross - field diffusion .",
    "these estimates depend on the acceleration time scale , which may be smaller for oblique shocks @xcite , but even if the perpendicular field configuration is assumed , the critical energy can not be much larger then @xmath45 ev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "note also , that in that case the proton spectrum is probably very steep .",
    "it is worthy to mention about an interesting non - standard fermi mechanism of particle acceleration proposed recently by @xcite .",
    "this mechanism takes advantage of multiple particle conversions ( photon - induced or resulting from nucleon collisions ) from the charged state into neutral state and back . the charged particle ( proton ) downstream from the shock , when converted into neutral state ( neutron ) ,",
    "can get into the upstream region with no influence from the magnetic field . there , conversion to the charge state may occur and the particle is magnetically confined to the plasma flow . at the moment of conversion , the particle can be far from the shock , so it may be deflected by a large angle before reaching the shock again .",
    "the distribution of such particles is then isotropic upstream , what enables them to increase their energies in a whole cycle by a factor of @xmath46 . because of this",
    ", the process can be very efficient in producing uhecr particles , even if the efficiency of the converter mechanism alone is low .",
    "it should however be investigated in more details , also using numerical simulations .",
    "the purpose of this work was to present the current understanding of the first - order fermi acceleration processes at relativistic shocks .",
    "the present knowledge in that matter is confronted with various proposals of uhecr production at sources harboring relativistic shocks .",
    "it was not the aim of the work to fully discuss these models , we comment only on the features related to the assumed details of acceleration processes .",
    "there are however additional conditions that should be met by the models to account for the observed uhecr characteristics .",
    "any successful model , apart from being able to fit the spectrum of uhecrs , has also to match their composition and arrival direction distribution , account for possible small - scale clustering of events etc .",
    "such the issues are described in detail in , e.g. , @xcite .",
