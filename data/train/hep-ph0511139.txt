    "theories in @xmath1 dimensions are based on solutions ( assumed or exhibited ) to the @xmath2-dimensional einstein equations that contain @xmath3 compact dimensions whose typical size we denote by @xmath4 .",
    "these models can be conveniently divided into `` large '' and `` small '' extra dimensional theories , subdivided into models containing branes and those that not .",
    "large extra dimensional theories  @xcite assume @xmath5 to be of sub - millimeter - size and that all fields but gravity are confined to a 4-dimensional subspace ( the `` brane '' ) . in these models",
    "the electroweak scale @xmath6 is the only energy scale , and the planck mass is a derived quantity equal to @xmath7 .",
    "however , @xmath8 is also required , which can be maintained only through fine tuning .",
    "in addition there is no inclusion of the brane - induced gravitational effects and , finally , there are complications when implementing the confining mechanism",
    ".    the simplest model with small extra dimensions containing branes  @xcite is obtained from an explicit solution to the einstein equations with one or two branes , assuming that the main brane contribution to the energy momentum tensor comes from the brane cosmological constants . this model ( and its extensions )",
    "have the virtue of relating the plank and weak scales through a metric - induced exponential conformal factor that naturally implements the hierarchy @xmath9 when @xmath10 .",
    "this , however , is achieved at a price : the brane and bulk cosmological constants must be appropriately tuned to achieve this effect . in addition the perturbative expansion around the solutions obtained produces a zero mode , indicating that the obtained configuration is marginally stable .",
    "finally , the `` universal '' extra - dimensional models  @xcite also assume small extra dimensions ( @xmath11 ) but now without branes ; the compact directions are flat and that all fields propagate throughout the @xmath2-dimensional space .",
    "these models avoid phenomenologically unacceptable deviations from low - energy physics because of the absence of vertices containing a single heavy leg ( a consequence of momentum conservation )  @xcite .",
    "such theories contain dimensional non - renormalizable couplings ( as all higher - dimensional theories ) which imply the presence of an energy scale @xmath12 ( the cut - off ) beyond which the theory can not be applied ( at least perturbatively ) . despite this such models",
    "have the virtue of containing scalars whose masses do not suffer form @xmath13 corrections , these being instead @xmath14  @xcite,@xcite .    in this talk",
    "we will consider a 5-dimensional universal model containing only gauge - fields and fermions .",
    "we will describe a very general type of behavior for the fields under the symmetries of the compact subspace , and derive some of the associated consequences , concentrating on the possible light spectra present in such models .",
    "these features are then illustrated with 2 examples ( we do not address the stability of the assumed space - time configuration , nor do we consider any gravitational effects ) .",
    "the ultimate goal of these models is to construct a realistic theory without including fundamental ( 5-dimensional ) scalars ; as far as the authors know such model does not yet exist , still , we hope to show that these theories are sufficiently interesting to warrant further study .",
    "the lagrangian is assumed to have the form = - 4 _ a ( f_mn^a)^2 + | ( i ^n d_n - m ) , where all fermions have been lumped in a large multiplet @xmath15 , the covariant derivative equals @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( which is the dimensional coupling mentioned previously ) and the @xmath18 generate the ( in general reducible ) representation carried by the fermions .",

    "universal higher - dimensional theories must satisfy the minimum constraint of generating the experimentally observed light spectrum ; because of this it is of interest to derive the general properties of these excitations . to this end",
    "it proves convenient to expand the various fields in fourier modes in the compact coordinate @xmath69 , the coefficients are then 4-dimensional fields for which the action of @xmath70 generates a mass term .",
    "it follows that all @xmath69-dependent modes will be heavy ( mass @xmath71 ) and that light excitations are associated with @xmath69-independent modes .",
    "the light gauge bosons will be denoted by @xmath72 and the light fermions by @xmath73 , the light modes associated with @xmath74 behave as 4-dimensional scalars and will be denoted by @xmath75 . using the @xmath76independence of these modes and the behavior of the field under @xmath54 we find a_^a & = & _ a b a_^b = _ a b a_^b,^r & = & _ r s ^s= -_r s ^s , 0 & = & 0 = -_5 0 .",

    "the above set of constraints ( [ eq : tcons],[eq : rcons],[eq : qcons ] ) can be simplified by an appropriate choice of bases .",
    "one can then take = , = , [ eq : newb ] ( the @xmath82 and @xmath83 matrices in @xmath84 must have the same dimensions ; this is not the case in @xmath85 ) . in this basis",

    "note however that the form of @xmath66 disallows any tree - level potential for the @xmath94 ; it follows that _ at tree - level _ all 4-dimensional bosons are either massless or have a mass @xmath71 .",
    "if these models are to be phenomenologically viable , they must be able to generate masses for some of the vector bosons at a characteristic scale @xmath95 .",
    "this symmetry breaking step can not be associated with the behavior of the fields under @xmath54 which necessarily produces non - zero masses of order @xmath96 .",
    "but it _ can _ result from radiative corrections since these will generate a non - vanishing ( effective ) potential for the @xmath97 at @xmath98 loops .",
    "this opens the possibility that these models will undergo two stages of symmetry breaking : the first generated by the behavior under @xmath54 and the second , at a presumably lower scale , generated radiatively by the scalars .",
