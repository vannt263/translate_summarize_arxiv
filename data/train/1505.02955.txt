    "describe a test to decide whether a systems of three equivalence relations is embeddable into a system of equivalences associated to three directions in the plane .",
    "concerning item @xmath60 and @xmath61 of problems [ problems ] let us mention that the class of systems embeddable into a system of equivalences given by three directions in the plane is closed under embeddability .",
    "this fact leads to he following problems    which are the finite minimal non representable systems ?",
    "how many non isomorphic are they ?",
    "finitely many ?      to conclude , we indicate first how our study fits in the context of universal algebra .",
    "the set of congruences of a universal algebra on a set @xmath1 is a basic example of a set of equivalence relations .",
    "this set ordered by inclusion forms a lattice , in fact a sublattice of the lattice @xmath14 .",
    "one of the oldest unsolved problem in universal algebra is the finite lattice representation problem :    _ is every finite lattice isomorphic to the congruence lattice of a finite algebra ? _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an approach to this problem is related to our study . indeed , for @xmath62 a subset of @xmath14 , let @xmath63 , resp .",

    ", a sublattice @xmath71 of @xmath14 is not the congruence lattice of an algebra on @xmath1 . indeed ,",
    "pierce s result implies that relational system @xmath72 made of equivalence relations is semirigid if and only if @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) .",
    "we recall that @xmath76 is the lattice on five element made of a @xmath77-element antichain and a top and bottom added .",
    "three equivalences together with the equality relation and the full equivalence relation on @xmath1 form an sublattice of @xmath14 isomorphic to @xmath78 if @xmath79 the meet of any two distinct equivalence relations is the equality relation ( this amounts to the fact that the intersection of any pair of equivalence classes belonging to two distinct equivalence relations contains at most one element ) and @xmath80 the join of two is the full set @xmath81 of ordered pairs .",
    "as shown by zdori @xcite :    [ thm : zadori2 ] if @xmath82 made of three equivalences relations is semirigid then these equivalence relations together with the equality relation and the full equivalence relation on @xmath1 form a sublattice @xmath71 of @xmath14 , isomorphic to the lattice @xmath78 .    provided that @xmath1 has more than three elements , the lattice @xmath71 , mentionned in theorem [ thm : zadori2 ] , is distinct from @xmath83 ( which is equal to @xmath14 since @xmath43 is semirigid ) hence is not the congruence lattice of an algebra on @xmath1 .",

    "if @xmath62 is a set of equivalences on a finite set @xmath1 , the congruence lattice @xmath83 is made of all equivalence relations definable by primitive positive formulas from @xmath62 ( see @xcite for an easy to read presentation ) .",
    "we hope that this result could help in our problems on semirigid relations .",
    "next , we mention that some systems made of three equivalence relations on the same set play an important role in the study of latin squares and quasigroups .",

    "no two lines from the same class are adjacent ; 3 .",
    "any point is incident with exactly one line from each class .",

    "the continuity of @xmath322 will follows from the fact that @xmath611 for every @xmath607\\cap d$ ] ( indeed , from the additivity condition , that means that @xmath322 is @xmath311-lipschitz , hence continuous ) .",
    "so given @xmath607\\cap d$ ] , let @xmath612\\cap \\mathbb q x=(\\mathbb q\\cap [ 0 , \\frac{1}{x}])x$ ] .",

    "it is easily checked that no such @xmath617 can be included in @xmath618 if @xmath619 .",
    "now we may conclude that either @xmath373 is constant or the identity .",
    "indeed , if @xmath373 is constant on @xmath488 then , in particular @xmath620 , in which case @xmath621 .",
    "hence , by our claim , @xmath322 is @xmath134 on @xmath622\\cap d$ ] .",
    "thus the image of @xmath623 is @xmath484 and @xmath373 is constant . if @xmath373 is not constant on @xmath488 then , as we have seen , @xmath373 is the identity on @xmath488 . in this case",
    "@xmath624 , hence @xmath625 .",

    "thus , @xmath373 is the identity on @xmath618 , proving that @xmath591 is semirigid .      according to zdori s result",
