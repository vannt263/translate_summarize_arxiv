    "applications of perturbative qcd to deeply virtual compton scattering and hard exclusive electroproduction processes @xcite require a generalization of usual parton distributions for the case when long - distance information is accumulated in nonforward matrix elements @xmath8 of quark and gluon light - cone operators . as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , such matrix elements can be parametrized by two basic types of nonperturbative functions . with @xmath9",
    "taken in the lightcone `` minus '' direction , the double distributions ( dds ) @xmath1 specify the light - cone `` plus '' fractions @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the initial hadron momentum @xmath12 and the momentum transfer @xmath13 carried by the initial parton .",
    "though @xmath9 is an integration variable , only one direction on the lightcone ( specified by external momenta ) is important for the lightcone - dominated processes . in other words ,",
    "only the lightcone plus direction of the hadron @xmath12 and @xmath13 momenta are essential for such processes . by definition ,",
    "the dds @xmath1 do not depend on the @xmath14 ratio . on the other hand , treating the proportionality coefficient as an independent parameter : @xmath15 , one can introduce an alternative description in terms of the nonforward parton distributions @xmath2 with @xmath16 being the total fraction of the initial hadron momentum taken by the initial parton .",
    "the shape of the functions @xmath2 explicitly depends on the parameter @xmath5 characterizing the skewedness of the relevant nonforward matrix element .",
    "this parametrization of nonforward matrix elements by @xmath2 is similar to that proposed originally by x. ji @xcite who introduced off - forward parton distributions ( ofpds ) @xmath17 .",
    "the latter are close to functions considered earlier in ref .",
    "the functions @xmath17 have a simple relation to nonforward distributions ( nfpds ) @xmath2 , while the non - diagonal distributions @xmath18 discussed by collins , frankfurt and strikman @xcite essentially coincide with @xmath19 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . the basic distinction between our approach and those of refs .",
    "@xcite is that we treat the double distributions @xmath1 as the primary objects of the qcd analysis producing the nonforward distributions @xmath2 ( and other types of distributions ) after an appropriate integration .",
    "the formalism of double distributions provides a rather effective tool for studying some general ( e.g. , spectral ) properties of nfpds and it allows to find analytic solutions of evolution equations @xcite . incorporating symmetries of dds @xcite imposes rather strong restrictions on realistic models of nfpds .",
    "a possible strategy for a self - consistent model building is to use nonperturbative or phenomenological approaches ( mit bag , quark models , qcd sum rule ideas , etc . ) to construct double distributions at low normalization point and then evolve them to higher @xmath20 values .",
    "the evolution equation for the nonsinglet quark double distribution was derived in ref.@xcite , where its analytic solution was also given .",
    "evolution of the gluon distribution in pure gluodynamics was discussed in refs.@xcite . in this paper , we present also a full set of evolution equations for the flavor - singlet case and derive a solution following the method of refs.@xcite .",
    "an independent study of singlet evolution based on our approach was performed in ref.@xcite .",
    "evolution equations for various versions of nonforward distributions can be found in @xcite .",
    "a convenient way to obtain the relevant evolution kernels is to use the universal light - ray evolution kernels @xcite .",
    "the evolution of nonforward distributions was studied numerically in refs.@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we incorporate the spectral and symmetry properties of double distributions to construct some simple models for dds . using the relations between dds and nfpds / ofpds",
    ", we derive models for the latter and show that using the formalism of double distributions we can easily explain characteristic qualitative and quantitative features of the evolution of nonforward distributions observed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the amplitudes of the dvcs process @xmath21 and hard electroproduction @xmath22 can be specified by the initial nucleon momentum @xmath12 , the momentum transfer @xmath23 and the momentum @xmath24 of the final photon or meson . to get a bjorken - type scaling limit",
    ", one should also keep the invariant momentum transfer @xmath25 small compared to the virtuality @xmath26 of the initial photon and the energy invariant @xmath27 .",
    "the essential features of the hard electroproduction processes ( dvcs included ) can be most easily demonstrated if we set @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and use @xmath12 , @xmath24 as the basic light - cone ( sudakov ) 4-vectors .",
    "it is easy to see that the requirement @xmath31 reduces in this limit to the condition @xmath32 which can be satisfied only if the two lightlike momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 are proportional to each other : @xmath33 , where @xmath5 coincides with the bjorken variable @xmath34 .",
    "the latter satisfies the constraint @xmath35 . for small but finite @xmath36 and @xmath37 ,",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath13 still must have a non - zero plus component @xmath38 .",
    "it also may have a transverse component @xmath39 .    in the pqcd factorization treatment of hard electroproduction processes ,",
    "the nonperturbative information is accumulated in the nonforward matrix element @xmath40 ( we use here @xmath41 as a generic notation for quark ( @xmath42 ) or gluonic ( @xmath43 ) fields ) .",
    "it depends on the relative coordinate @xmath9 through three invariant variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the forward case , when @xmath46 , one gets the usual parton distributions by fourier transforming the light - cone projected ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) matrix element with respect to @xmath48 . in the nonforward case , we can try to start with the general fourier representation @xmath49 with respect to all three @xmath9-dependent invariants .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath50 can be called a _",
    "triple _ distribution .",
    "note that the generous @xmath51 limits for all three variables @xmath52 serve for a most general function of @xmath53 and @xmath45 .",
    "however , incorporating information that the fourier transformation is written for a function @xmath54 given by feynman integrals having specific causality properties , one arrives at more narrow limits : @xmath55 runs from 0 to @xmath56 , @xmath57 is between @xmath58 and 1 while @xmath59 is between @xmath60 and 1 ( this was proven in @xcite for any feynman diagram using the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to interpret the @xmath57-variable as the fraction of the initial momentum @xmath12 carried by the relevant parton , it makes sense to separate integration over positive and negative @xmath57 components and redefine @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the negative @xmath57 component .",
    "after that , the @xmath57-variable is always positive and @xmath57 and @xmath59 are further constrained by inequality @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "these spectral conditions can be summarized by the following representation @xmath64   \\theta(x+y \\leq 1 )   \\,dx \\ , dy   \\ , , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath65 and @xmath66 result from positive-@xmath57 and negative-@xmath57 components of @xmath50 respectively . in particular , for quark operators , @xmath67 can be interpreted as the quark distribution while @xmath68 as the antiquark one ( a more detailed discussion is given in the next section ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath59 and @xmath69 can be interpreted as the fractions in which the momentum transfer @xmath13 is shared among the two fields of the composite operator @xmath70 .",
    "finally , the @xmath55 variable characterizes the virtuality of these fields . for a light - cone dominated process ,",
    "the leading term is given by the @xmath71 limit of the nonforward matrix element , i.e. by zeroth moment of @xmath72 with respect to @xmath55 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the _",
    "double distribution_.    for a lightlike interval @xmath47 , one can treat @xmath9 as having only light - cone `` minus '' component , and then the scalar products @xmath44 project out the `` plus '' components of general ( non - lightlike ) momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this allows to give a parton interpretation of @xmath74 as a probability amplitude for the active parton to carry fractions @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the plus components of the external momenta @xmath13 and @xmath12 . though the momenta @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be treated as proportional to each other @xmath77 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 specify the `` + ' '",
    "-momentum flow in two different channels . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the net `` + ' ' -momentum flows only in the @xmath79-channel and the total `` + ' ' -momentum entering into the composite operator vertex is zero . in this case , the matrix element is analogous to a distribution function . the partons entering the composite vertex then carry the fractions @xmath80 of the initial proton momentum ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "when @xmath82 is negative , we interpret the parton as belonging to the final state to secure that the integral always runs over the segment @xmath83 . in this parton picture , the spectators take the remaining momentum @xmath84 . on the other hand , if the total `` + ' ' -momentum flowing through the composite vertex is @xmath76 , the matrix element has the structure of a distribution amplitude in which the momentum @xmath76 splits into the fractions @xmath11 and @xmath85 carried by the two fields that appear in the vertex . in a combined situation ,",
    "when both @xmath75 and @xmath76 are nonzero , the initial parton takes @xmath86 , while the final one carries the momentum @xmath87 . for @xmath46",
    ", we get the forward matrix element which is parametrized by the usual parton distributions @xmath4 .",
    "this gives reduction relations @xcite connecting double distributions with the usual ones ( see eqs.([34]),([35 ] ) below ) .",
    "for quark operators , the double distributions are defined by the following representation @xcite : @xmath88 for parton helicity - averaged ones and by @xmath89 in the parton helicity - sensitive case . here and in what follows",
    "we adhere to the `` bar '' convention @xmath90 , @xmath91 for momentum fractions and use the `` russian hat '' notation @xmath92 . as usual , @xmath93 are the dirac spinors for the nucleon . in this definition ,",
    "we explicitly separate quark and antiquark components of the double distribution .",
    "note that such a separation is unambiguous : in the fourier representation , it is completely determined by the sign of the @xmath57-term in the exponential .    to clarify the physical meaning of separating the dds into two components ,",
    "it is instructive to consider the forward limit @xmath46 in which the matrix element is parametrized by usual parton densities , e.g. , in the helicity averaged case @xmath94 the exponential factors accompanying the quark and antiquark distributions reflect the fact that the field @xmath95 appearing in the operator @xmath96 consists of the quark annihilation operator ( quark with momentum @xmath97 comes into this point ) and the antiquark creation operator ( i.e. , antiquark with momentum @xmath97 goes out of this point ) . to get the relative signs with which quark and antiquark distributions appear in these definitions",
    ", we should take into account that antiquark creation and annihilation operators appear in @xmath96 in the opposite order . comparing the expression ( [ 33 ] ) with the @xmath98 limit of the definitions for dds",
    ", we obtain `` reduction formulas '' relating the two components of the double distributions to the quark and antiquark parton densities , respectively : @xmath99 and similarly for the helicity - sensitive case : @xmath100 the reduction formulas tell us that integrating the double distribution @xmath101 over a vertical line @xmath102const in the @xmath103-plane , one gets the quark density @xmath104 while integrating its counterpart @xmath105 gives the antiquark density @xmath106 .",
    "this is an illustration of our statement that @xmath107 and @xmath108 are independent functions . in particular",
    ", @xmath107 contains the valence component ( reducing to @xmath109 ) absent in @xmath108 .",
    "our definitions ( [ 31 ] ) , ( [ 32 ] ) reflect the results of the @xmath110-representation analysis @xcite that the plus component of the momentum of the particle ( either quark or antiquark ) _ going out _ of the hadronic blob can be written as @xmath111 with both @xmath57 and @xmath59 positive and @xmath112 .",
    "this is in full compliance with the parton model based expectation that the initial hadron splits into an active parton and spectators which both carry positive fractions of its plus momentum . to show the positivity of the plus momentum component for spectators",
    ", we should explicitly take into account that , in the kinematics of dvcs and hard electroproduction processes , the plus component of the momentum transfer @xmath23 is positive @xmath113 . requiring that the plus component of the final hadron momentum is also positive ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath114 .",
    "hence , @xmath115 ( since @xmath114 and @xmath63 ) , i.e. , the plus component of the momentum carried by spectators is also positive . on the other hand , the parton _ `` going back '' _ has the momentum whose plus component @xmath116 may be either positive or negative , depending on the relationship between @xmath57 , @xmath59 and @xmath5 . when @xmath117 is negative , one may wish to interpret such a parton as an antiparton leaving the hadron together with the initial parton .",
    "one should remember , however , that the double distributions @xmath1 `` know nothing '' about the magnitude of the skewedness @xmath5 : they are universal functions describing flux of @xmath75 and @xmath76 independently of what the ratio @xmath14 might be . as we explained above , the quark dds",
    "are unambiguously divided into two separate components @xmath118 and @xmath119 , but there is no further subdivision inside them based on interrelation between the values of @xmath57 and @xmath59 .    in a similar way",
    ", we can introduce double distributions for the gluons @xmath120",
    "@xmath121    there are no `` antigluons '' , so the positive-@xmath57 and negative-@xmath57 parts are described by the same function .",
    "note that our definition of the gluon double distributions here differs from that used in our earlier papers@xcite by an extra factor of @xmath57 in its right hand side .",
    "this form is more convenient for applications of the method of refs .",
    "@xcite to solve evolution equations for double distributions in the singlet case .",
    "the choice made above corresponds also to the simplest form of the reduction formulas @xmath122    another ambiguity in the definition of the gluon double distribution is related to the overall factor @xmath123 in the rhs of eqs.([36 ] ) and ( [ 37 ] ) . instead of it , we could take , e.g. , @xmath124 or @xmath125 ( such a choice is utterly inconvenient for taking the forward limit ) or @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a symmetric combination of the initial and final momenta .",
