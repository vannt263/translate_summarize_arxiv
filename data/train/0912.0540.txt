    "the main technical ingredient of the spin - foam models of 4-dimensional gravity is so called quantum simplicity constraint . imposing suitably defined constraint on the domain of the ( discrete ) path integral turns the su(2)@xmath2su(2 ) ( or sl(2,c ) ) bf theory into the spin - foam model of the euclidean ( respectively , lorentzian ) gravity @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the simplicity constraint believed to be correct , or at least fitting gravity the best among the known approaches @xcite , is the one derived by engle , pereira , rovelli , livine ( eprl ) @xcite ( and independently derived by freidel and krasnov @xcite ) .",
    "the solutions to the eprl simplicity constraint are eprl su(2)@xmath2su(2 ) intertwiners .",
    "they are defined by the eprl transformation , which maps each su(2 ) intertwiner into a eprl solution of the simplicity constraint .",
    "an attempt is made in the literature @xcite to parametrize the space of the eprl solutions by the su(2 ) intertwiners .",
    "the vertex amplitude and the partition function of the eprl model seem to written in in terms of that parametrization .",
    "the questions we raise and answer in this paper are :    * is the eprl map injective , does nt it kill any su(2 ) intertwiner ? * is the eprl map isometric , does it preserve the scalar product between the su(2 ) intertwiners ? * if not , what is a form of a partition function derived from the so(4 ) intertwiner hilbert product written directly in terms of the su(2 ) intertwiners , the preimages of the eprl map ?    we prove that the eprl map is injective for n - valent vertex in case when it is a map from @xmath0 into @xmath1 representations .",
    "the full proof of injectivity of eprl map ( without additional assumptions from this paper ) in the case @xmath3 has already been provided in @xcite . in those cases , there are as many su(2)@xmath2su(2 ) eprl intertwiners as there are the su(2 ) intertwiners .",
    "owing to this result the su(2 ) intertwiners indeed can be used to parametrize the space of the eprl su(2)@xmath2su(2)intertwiners .",
    "however , we find the eprl map is not isometric . in consequence , there are two inequivalent definitions of the partition function .",
    "one possibility is to use a basis in the eprl intertwiners space orthonormal with respect to the so(4 ) representations . and",
    "this is what we do in this paper .",
    "a second possibility , is to use the basis obtained as the image of an orthonormal basis of the su(2 ) intertwiners under the eprl map .",
    "the partition function derived in @xcite corresponds to the second choice , whereas the first one is ignored therein .",
    "the goal of this part of our paper is pointing out the first possibility and deriving the corresponding partition function .",
    "after the derivation , we compare our partition function with that of eprl on a possibly simple example .",
    "we conjecture , that the difference converges to zero for large spins .    to make the paper intelligible we start presentation of the new results with the derivation of the partition function in section [ problem ] . the final formula for our proposal for the partition function for the eprl model is presented in section [ solution ]",
    "the lack of the isometricity of the eprl map is illustrated on specific examples in section [ example ] .",
    "finally , the proof of the injectivity of the eprl map takes all the section [ proof ] .",
