    "intermediate - mass ( 1.55 @xmath1 ) stars have been gathering more attention of researchers as promising sites of planet formation .",
    "it is not only because some planetary systems were found around a - type dwarfs by direct imaging ( e.g. @xcite ) but also intensive doppler surveys of intermediate - mass giants and subgiants , which are `` evolved counterparts of a - type dwarfs '' , have unveiled remarkable properties of planets around them ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "about 50 substellar companions have been found around such evolved intermediate - mass stars , whose masses , semimajor axes , and eccentricities are ranging from 0.6 to 40 @xmath17 , from 0.08 to 6 au , and from 0 to 0.5 , respectively .",
    "the occurrence rate of giant planets increases as stellar mass at least up to @xmath211.9@xmath1 ( @xmath211020% ; e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and super - massive ( @xmath22 ) planets are more abundant around more massive ( @xmath23 ) giants ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "positive correlation between frequency of giant planets and stellar metallicity may exist in subgiants like in solar - type stars ( @xcite ) but not be seen in giants ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "semimajor - axis distribution of the planets is one of the most interesting features ; almost all the planets found around intermediate - mass evolved stars reside in orbits with semimajor axis larger than 0.6 au ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , while many short - period planets exist around low - mass fgk dwarfs .",
    "multi - planet systems have also been found around evolved intermediate - mass stars including candidates in mean motion resonance ( mmr ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "all the properties give us deep insight into formation and evolution of substellar companions around intermediate - mass stars .",
    "we here report the detections of new substellar companions around evolved intermediate - mass stars emerged from the okayama planet search program ( @xcite ) .",
    "the program has been regularly monitoring radial velocities ( rvs ) of about 300 intermediate - mass gk giants since 2001 at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) and announced 9 planets and 1 brown dwarf so far ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also discovered 3 planets and 3 brown - dwarf candidates around gk giants using 2.16 m telescope at xinglong observatory in china , 1.8 m telescope at bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory in korea , and subaru 8.2 m telescope in hawaii as well as oao 1.88 m telescope under the framework of east - asian planet search network ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the observations in section [ obs ] and the stellar properties are presented in section [ stpara ] .",
    "analyses of rv , linear trend , period search , orbital solution , and line shape variation are described in section [ ana ] and the results are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "section [ summary ] is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "all of the observations were made with the 1.88 m telescope and the high dispersion echelle spectrograph ( hides ; @xcite ) at oao . in 2007 december",
    ", hides was upgraded from single ccd ( 2k@xmath244k ) to a mosaic of three ccds .",
    "the upgrade enabled us to obtain spectra covering a wavelength range of 37507500@xmath25 using a red cross - disperser , which is about three times wider than before the upgrade .    for precise rv measurements",
    ", we used an iodine absorption cell ( i@xmath26 cell ; @xcite ) , which provides a fiducial wavelength reference in a wavelength range of 50005800@xmath25 ( covered by the middle ccd after the upgrade in 2007 december ) .",
    "a slit width is set to 200 @xmath27 m ( @xmath28 ) giving a spectral resolution ( @xmath29 ) of 67000 by about 3.3 pixels sampling .",
    "we can typically obtain a signal - to - noise ratio s / n@xmath30200 pix@xmath14 for a @xmath31 star with an exposure time shorter than 30 min .",
    "the reduction of echelle data ( i.e. bias subtraction , flat - fielding , scattered - light subtraction , and spectrum extraction ) is performed using the iraf software package in the standard way .",
    "@xcite derived atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature @xmath32 , surface gravity @xmath33 , micro - turbulent velocity @xmath34 , and fe abundance [ fe / h ] ) of all the targets for okayama planet search program based on the spectroscopic approach using the equivalent widths of well - behaved fe i and fe ii lines of iodine - free stellar spectra .",
    "details of the procedure and resultant parameters are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they also determined the absolute magnitude @xmath35 of each star from the apparent @xmath36-band magnitude and hipparcos parallax @xmath37 ( @xcite ) taking account of correction of interstellar extinction @xmath38 based on @xcite s table .",
    "the bolometric correction @xmath39 was estimated based on the @xcite s theoretical calculation .",
    "with use of these parameters and theoretical evolutionary tracks of @xcite , the luminosity @xmath40 and mass @xmath41 of each star were obtained .",
    "the stellar radius @xmath42 was estimated using the stefan - boltzmann relationship and the measured @xmath40 and @xmath32 .",
    "the stars presented herein are plotted on the hr diagram in figure [ fig - hrd ] and their properties are summarized in table [ tbl - stars ] .",
    "the uncertainties for atmospheric and physical parameters of the stars were also derived by @xcite and we quoted the values in table [ tbl - stars ] . since details of the procedure are described in @xcite , we here briefly summarize it .",
    "the uncertainties of [ fe / h ] , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath43 presented in the table are internal statistical errors for a given data set of fe  i and fe  ii line equivalent widths ( see subsection 5.2 of @xcite )",
    ". since these parameter values are sensitive to slight changes in the equivalent widths as well as to the adopted set of lines ( @xcite ) , realistic uncertainties may be by a factor of @xmath21 23 larger than these estimates from a conservative point of view ( e.g. , 50100 @xmath44 in @xmath32 , 0.10.2  dex in @xmath33 ) .",
    "therefore the ranges of stellar mass were obtained by perturbing the values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 $ ] interchangeably by typical amounts of uncertainties ; @xmath48 corresponding to parallax errors given in the hipparcos catalog , @xmath49 of @xmath50 dex almost corresponding to @xmath51  k , and @xmath52}$ ] of @xmath53 dex . similarly , the error in @xmath42 was evaluated from @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see the section 3.2 and footnote 8 of @xcite for the details of the procedure ) .",
    "the resulting mass value may also appreciably depend on the chosen set of theoretical evolutionary tracks ( e.g. , the systematic difference as large as @xmath54 for the case of metal - poor tracks between @xcite and @xcite . ; see also footnote 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "hipparcos observations revealed photometric stability for the stars down to @xmath55 mag .",
    "furthermore , all the stars show no significant emission in the core of ca ii hk lines as shown in figure [ fig - cah ] , suggesting that the stars are chromospherically inactive .",

    "for rv analysis , we basically adopted the modeling technique of an i@xmath26-superposed stellar spectrum ( star+i@xmath26 ) detailed in @xcite , which is based on the method by @xcite . in the technique ,",
    "a star+i@xmath26 spectrum is modeled as a product of a high resolution i@xmath26 and a stellar template spectrum convolved with a modeled instrumental profile ( ip ) of the spectrograph . to obtain the stellar template , @xcite extracted a high resolution stellar spectrum from several star+i@xmath26 spectra . however , we here used a stellar template that was obtained by deconvolving a pure stellar spectrum with the spectrograph ip estimated from an i@xmath26-superposed b - star or flat spectrum because we finally found that the overall precision in rv using the template thus obtained was slightly better than that based on the technique in @xcite .",
    "we have now achieved a long - term doppler precision of about 45 m s@xmath14 over a time span of 9 years .",
    "measurement error was estimated from an ensemble of velocities from each of @xmath21300 spectral regions ( each @xmath213@xmath25 long ) in every exposure .",
    "we examined whether there is evidence of a linear trend in rvs with timescale much larger than the duration of observations . to address the significance of the velocity trend",
    ", we used the @xmath56-test in a similar way to that described by @xcite .",
    "the weighted sum of squares of residuals to the best - fit linear slope @xmath57 is compared with the weighted sum of squares about the mean @xmath58 .",
    "if there is no long - term trend in observed velocities and the residual follow gaussian distribution , the statistic @xmath59 follows fisher s @xmath56 distribution with 1 and @xmath60 degrees of freedom which measures how much the fit is improved by introducing the linear trend . using this probability distribution",
    ", we can estimate the false alarm probability @xmath61 that pure noise fluctuations would produce a linear velocity trend by chance .",
    "this method , however , assumes that the errors follow gaussian distribution , which is not necessarily the case for the actual observations . in stead",
    "we here adopt so called a bootstrap randomization method to estimate @xmath62 . in this approach ,",
    "the observed rvs are randomly redistributed , keeping fixed the observation time .",
    "the major advantage of this method is that one can derive @xmath62 without assuming any particular distribution of noise . for each star",
    ", we generated 10@xmath63 fake datasets in this way , applied the same analysis to them , and obtained @xmath56-value by the equation ( [ f - test ] ) .",
    "the frequency of fake datasets whose @xmath56 exceeded the observed one was adopted as a @xmath62 for the trend .      to search for periodicity in rv data we performed a lomb - scargle periodogram analysis ( @xcite ) . to assess the significance of this periodicity , we estimate false alarm probability ( @xmath62 ) , using a bootstrap randomization method in which the observed rvs were randomly redistributed , keeping fixed the observation time .",
    "we generated 10@xmath63 fake datasets in this way , and applied the same periodogram analysis to them .",
    "the frequency of fake datasets which exhibit a periodogram power higher than the observed dataset is adopted as a @xmath62 for the signal .",
    "the best - fit keplerian orbit for the data was derived using a levenberg - marquardt fitting algorithm ( @xcite ) to obtain a minimum chi - squared solution by varying the free parameters ( orbital period @xmath64 , time of periastron passage @xmath65 , eccentricity @xmath66 , velocity amplitude @xmath67 and argument of periastron @xmath68 for each companion ) .",
    "when we found a significant linear trend in observed rvs by the analysis described in section [ linear trend ] , we included the slope as a free parameter and simultaneously derived the best - fit trend and keplerian orbit for the data .",
    "each star has stellar `` jitter '' , which is intrinsic variability in rv as a source of astrophysical noise such as stellar oscillation and chromospheric activity , and also unknown systematic measurement error . to account for the variability",
    ", we have quadratically added a jitter @xmath69 to the rv measurement uncertainties before performing the final least - squared fitting of the orbit so that the resultant reduced @xmath70 would become unity .",
    "the uncertainty for each orbital parameter was estimated using a bootstrap monte carlo approach , subtracting the theoretical fit , scrambling the residuals , adding the theoretical fit back to the residuals and then refitting .",
    "we performed spectral line shape analysis based on high resolution stellar templates to investigate other possible causes of apparent rv variations such as pulsation and rotational modulation rather than orbital motion .",
    "details of the analysis are described in @xcite and @xcite , and here we briefly summarize the procedure .    at first , we extracted two stellar templates from five star+i@xmath26 spectra at nearly the peak and valley phases of observed rvs for each star .",
    "cross correlation profiles of the two templates were then calculated for about 40100 spectral segments ( 45@xmath25 width each ) in which severely blended lines or broad lines were not included .",
    "we calculated three bisector quantities for the derived cross correlation profile for each segment : the velocity span ( bvs ) , which is the velocity difference between two flux levels of the bisector ; the velocity curvature ( bvc ) , which is the difference of the velocity span of the upper half and lower half of the bisector ; and the velocity displacement ( bvd ) , which is the average of the bisector at three different flux levels .",
    "flux levels of 25% , 50% , and 75% of the cross correlation profile were used to calculate the above three bisector quantities . if both of the bvs and the bvc for stars are identical to zero and the average bvd agrees with the velocity difference between the two templates at the peak and valley phases of observed rvs ( @xmath71 ) , the cross correlation profiles can be considered to be symmetric and thus the observed rv variations are considered to be due to parallel shifts of the spectral lines , which is consistent with the planetary hypothesis .",
    "we collected a total of 43 rv data of hd 5608 between 2003 february and 2011 november .",
    "the observed rvs are shown in figure [ fig - hd5608 ] and are listed in table [ tbl - hd5608 ] together with their estimated uncertainties .",
    "based on the linear - trend test described in section [ linear trend ] , the star showed a significant linear trend of @xmath72 m s@xmath14 yr@xmath14 with @xmath73 , suggesting the existence of an distant companion . after removing the trend from the observed rvs , lomb - scargle periodogram showed a significant peak around 766 day with a @xmath74 .",
    "simultaneous fitting of a single keplerian model and a linear trend to the data yielded an orbital period of @xmath75 days , a velocity semiamplitude @xmath76 m s@xmath14 , and an eccentricity @xmath77 for the inner companion , and the acceleration of @xmath78 m s@xmath14 yr@xmath14 for the linear trend .",
    "when we adopt the stellar mass of @xmath79 for the star , we obtained a minimum mass of the inner companion @xmath10 and a semimajor axis @xmath80 au .",
    "for the outer companion , we may give an order - of - magnitude relation between @xmath81 and the properties of the companion ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the companion mass , @xmath84 is the orbital inclination , and @xmath85 is the orbital radius .",

    "two such two - brown - dwarf systems have been previously reported : one is a possible 3:2 mmr system around the clump giant bd+20 2457 ( @xcite ) and the other is around a solar - type star hd 168443 ( @xcite ) .",
    "several scenarios are proposed for the formation of brown - dwarf - mass companions ; gravitational collapse in protostellar clouds like stellar binary systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and gravitational instability in cicumstellar disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "even core - accretion scenario could form such super - massive companions with @xmath143 on a certain truncation condition for gas accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of such two - companions in mmr suggests that they are formed in circumstellar disks by either gravitational instability or core - accretion , and then experience orbital migration .",
    "detailed analysis of orbital stability for the system will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "figure [ fig - stmass ] shows the semimajor - axis distribution of planets detected by rv method .",
    "it has been pointed out that almost no planets with @xmath144 0.6 au have been found around stars with masses 1.53 @xmath1 , and possible lack of planetary mass companions within 3 au around @xmath145 was also pointed out ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath0 uma b basically follows this trend ; planets tend to stay at outer orbits as stellar mass increases .",
    "the semimajor axis distribution should be determined by the balance between some factors such as lifetime of a protoplanetary disk , efficiency of planet formation , and efficiency of orbital migration .",
    "from the numerical simulation by @xcite , the lack of inner planets around intermediate - mass stars ( hereafter planet desert ) can be reproduced if gas in a disk around intermediate - mass stars dissipates more quickly than around lower mass stars , and then planets can not migrate inward before the gas dissipation . in the case of @xmath145 stars , however , the existence or absense of the planet desert seems more sensitive to the above factors compared with @xmath146 stars ; planets can form and migrate before the gas dissipation around @xmath145 stars depending on assumed lifetime of the disk .",
    "it is easier to explore inner planets around @xmath147 giants rather than around less massive ones because @xmath147 giants do not expand so largely at the tip of rgb .",
    "then we need not consider planet engulfment by central stars except for very short - period ones , while planets within 0.41 au around @xmath146 giants could have been engulfed during rgb phase of the central stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "planet searches around @xmath145 giants are thus highly encouraged .",
    "less massive planets ( @xmath148 ) around clump giants , such as @xmath0 crb b , should also be explored more intensively .",
    "@xcite statistically showed that relatively higher - mass ( @xmath149 ) planets tend to exist around intermediate - mass subgiants and excluded the same planet - mass distribution as that for solar - type stars . to push the detection limit from the current @xmath150 m s@xmath14 ( @xmath151 at @xmath152 au ) down to @xmath153 m s@xmath14 ( @xmath154 at @xmath152 au ) for",
    "clump giants ( @xmath9 ) will allow us to directly compare the mass distribution of jovian planets for a wide range of host star s mass ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - pmass ] ) . we are now trying to do this by high cadence observations for a part of the sample of okayama planet search program .",
    "the results will be presented in a forthcoming paper . + this research is based on data collected at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) , which is operated by national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) .",
    "we are grateful to all the staff members of oao for their support during the observations .",
