    "in nature there are many examples of glassy systems , _ i.e. _ complex systems that exhibit a very slow dynamics that prevents them to reach the equilibrium state . in this class",
    "there is a large variety of systems , like real glasses , spin glasses , supercooled liquids , polymers , granular material , colloids , ionic conductors , orientational glasses , vortex glasses @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these systems is the _ frustration _ , that is a competition due to geometry or energy constrains",
    ".    experiments on glasses @xcite show that in a temperature driven transition precursor phenomena starts at a temperature well above the ideal glass transition .",
    "this temperature depends on experimental conditions and is the onset of some dynamical anomalies , like non - exponential relaxation functions , anomalous diffusion , cooling rate dependent density .",
    "analogous phenomena are present in spin glasses ( sg ) @xcite , that are a generalization of ising model where random distributed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions give rise to frustration . in particular , experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite have shown non - exponential autocorrelation functions below a temperature @xmath6 well above the transition temperature @xmath7 , while above @xmath6 only exponential relaxation functions are seen .    to explain this phenomenon , randeria _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have suggested that in the sg the non - exponential regime starts at the griffiths temperature @xmath8 , _ i.e. _ the critical temperature of the ferromagnetic model , due to the presence of randomly large unfrustrated regions , allowed by the disorder in the sg interactions .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed an alternative hypothesis in which the onset @xmath6 of non - exponential behavior coincides with the percolation temperature @xmath9 of fortuin - kasteleyn @xcite coniglio - klein @xcite ( fk - ck ) clusters ( defined below ) .",
    "the idea of ref.@xcite is that in the sg the accessible phase space is simply connected above @xmath9 , while it is not below @xmath9 .",
    "therefore for @xmath10 a local monte carlo ( mc ) dynamics performs a random walk on a ramified percolating - like structure with many time scales , giving rise to non - exponential relaxation functions .",
    "since @xmath9 is less than , but close to , @xmath8 and @xmath6 is difficult to localize , it is not possible to exclude the @xmath11 hypothesis .",

    "the higher transition corresponds to a real thermodynamical transition of a @xmath0-state potts model @xcite . to make the algorithm faster we use the swendsen and wang ( sw ) @xcite cluster mc dynamics that prevent the slowing down for temperatures near @xmath4 .",
    "dynamical properties of the model for @xmath16 are given in ref.@xcite , where we have shown that autocorrelation times diverge at @xmath9 and , as in sg model , non - exponential relaxation functions are present below @xmath9 .",
    "these results on sg model @xcite , fp model @xcite , fully frustrated systems @xcite and psg model @xcite suggest that the fk - ck percolation may play a role in the context of precursor phenomena , since below @xmath9 the frustration is present at all length scales by means of fk - ck percolating cluster , that can not include frustrated loops .    in sec .",

    "in fact , the rg calculations in the case @xmath2 show a singularity at @xmath7 for the sg free energy and no singularity at @xmath38 .",
    "this result is interpreted in ref.@xcite supposing that the free energy of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an amplitude which vanishes for @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the specific heat exponent .",

    "this dynamic completely overcomes the problem of critical slowing down for the unfrustrated spin models @xcite , while turns out to suffer of diverging correlation time if applied to frustrated systems near a critical point .",
    "this inefficiency is a consequence of the fact that the fk - ck clusters used in the sw dynamics do not represent anymore in frustrated models the regions of correlated spins near a critical point @xcite and their percolation temperature @xmath9 is greater than the critical temperature . in particular , this is true for the sg model for which an efficient cluster mc dynamics does not yet exist except for 2d @xcite , while efficient cluster dynamics have been proposed for systems with frustration but without disorder @xcite .    nevertheless in sg for temperatures well above the critical temperature @xmath7 and near @xmath9",
    "the sw dynamics is still efficient , consistently with the general observation that the cluster dynamics are efficient at least for temperatures above the percolation temperature @xcite .",

    "we have considered systems with lattice sizes @xmath134 at temperatures above and below @xmath9 .",
    "the data for the sf dynamics are averaged over 32 different quenched interaction configurations , since the local updating of this dynamics strongly depends on the local fluctuation of the frustration . on the other hand the results on global sw dynamics",
    "turns out to be  robust \" respect the interaction configuration average , in the sense that the fluctuations of @xmath135 are within the errors estimated on the basis of a single interaction configuration analysis .",

    "analogous results have been found for smaller systems .",
    "the data show that , while the sf correlation times for @xmath82 and @xmath48 grow abruptly near @xmath9 where both thermodynamical and percolation transition occur , the sw correlation times only show a slow trend to increase for decreasing temperatures , being smaller than the correspondent sf data at least of an order of magnitude . even for @xmath141 ,",
    "that for sf starts to be non - zero below @xmath9 , the sw dynamics shows smaller correlation times . for temperatures well below @xmath9",
    "it is possible to see that the sw dynamics is characterized by long autocorrelation times , as the sf dynamics .",
    "therefore , at least for temperatures not too much below @xmath9 , the sw dynamics turns out to be more efficient than local sf dynamics .",
    "in particular , near the thermodynamical transition at @xmath9 the sw dynamics completely overcomes the critical slowing down problem in the psg model , as for the unfrustrated models , even if frustration is present via the random interactions of the ising spins .",

    "many numerical evidences on disordered @xcite and deterministic frustrated models @xcite have shown that @xmath6 is consistent with the percolation temperature @xmath9 of the the kasteleyn - fortuin and coniglio - klein clusters .",
    "in particular , a generalization of the @xmath1 ising sg to a @xmath13-state potts sg , that recovers the sg for @xmath2 , has shown that for @xmath16 , as for @xmath2 @xcite , the @xmath12 hypothesis is numerically verified @xcite . in this paper , using very efficient cluster monte carlo dynamics , we have shown that in 2d for any @xmath5 the percolation transition corresponds to a real thermodynamical transition in the universality class of the @xmath0-state ferromagnetic potts model . in particular , we have considered the case @xmath16 and the cases @xmath105 , 50 where at @xmath4 a second order and , respectively , a first order phase transition occurs .",
    "exact renormalization group calculations on hierarchical lattices @xcite and mean field analysis for a version of the model without disorder @xcite have shown the same scenario .",
    "all these results suggest that the percolation transition may play a role in the precursor phenomena even in the sg case ( @xmath2 ) , where no thermodynamical transition occurs at @xmath9 .",
    "this idea arises from the observation that , even in sg , below @xmath9 the frustration starts to be manifested on all the length scales by means of the fk - ck clusters , that can not include frustrated loops .",
    "therefore the scenario presented is that for @xmath5 at the percolation temperature @xmath9 there is a thermodynamical transition with associated dynamical anomalies that `` vanishes '' for @xmath2 leaving the dynamical behavior unchanged .",
