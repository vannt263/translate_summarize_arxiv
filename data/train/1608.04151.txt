    "the classical congruence subgroup problem ( csp ) asks for , say , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , whether every finite index subgroup of @xmath24 contains a principal congruence subgroup , i.e. a subgroup of the form @xmath25 for some @xmath26 .",
    "equivalently , it asks whether the natural map @xmath27 is injective , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the profinite completions of the group @xmath24 and the ring @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "more generally , the csp asks what is the kernel of this map .",
    "it is a classical @xmath31 century result that the answer is negative for @xmath32 . moreover ( but not so classical , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , the kernel , in this case , is @xmath15 - the free profinite group on a countable number of generators . on the other hand , for @xmath33 , the map is injective and the kernel is therefore trivial .",
    "the csp can be generalized as follows : let @xmath0 be a group and @xmath34 a finite index characteristic subgroup of it",
    ". denote : @xmath35 such a finite index normal subgroup of @xmath36 will be called a `` principal congruence subgroup '' and a finite index subgroup of @xmath24 which contains such a @xmath37 for some @xmath34 will be called a `` congruence subgroup '' .",
    "now , the csp for @xmath0 asks whether every finite index subgroup of @xmath24 is a congruence subgroup .",
    "when @xmath0 is finitely generated , this is equivalent to the question : is the map @xmath38 injective ? more generally , it asks what is the kernel @xmath2 of this map .    as @xmath39 ,",
    "the classical congruence subgroup results mentioned above can therefore reformulated as @xmath40 while @xmath41 for @xmath33 , when @xmath42 is the free abelian group on @xmath14 generators .",
    "very few results are known when @xmath0 is non - abelian .",
    "a very surprising result was proved in @xcite by asada by methods of algebraic geometry :    [ thm : free 2]@xmath9 , i.e. , the free group on two generators has the congruence subgroup property , namely @xmath43 is injective .",
    "a purely group theoretic proof for this theorem was given by bux - ershov - rapinchuk @xcite .",
    "this proof goes a long way also toward @xmath44 , the free metabelian group on two generators .",
    "but , quite surprising , the first named author showed in @xcite a negative answer , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , one can deduce from his work that :    [ thm:.metabelian 2]@xmath12 .",
    "the first two goals of this paper are to give much shorter proofs to these two results . along the way we give an explicitly constructed congruence subgroup @xmath37 of @xmath46 which",
    "is contained in a given finite index subgroup @xmath47 of @xmath46 of index @xmath14 .",
    "our estimates on the index of @xmath34 in @xmath10 as a function of @xmath14 are substantially better than those of @xcite - see theorems [ thm : explicit - ber ] and [ thm : explicit ] .",
    "we then go ahead and prove :    [ thm : metabelian 3]@xmath18 contains a copy of @xmath15 .",
    "inparticular , the congruence subgroup property ( strongly ) fails for @xmath48 .",
    "this is also surprising , especially if compered with an upcoming paper of the first author @xcite showing that @xmath19 is abelian for @xmath20 .",
    "so , while the dichotomy for the abelian case @xmath42 is between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , for the metabelian case , it is between @xmath49 and @xmath20 .",
    "a main ingredient of the proof of theorem [ thm : metabelian 3 ] is showing that @xmath50 is large , i.e. it has a finite index subgroup which is mapped onto a non - abelian free group .",
    "for this we use the method developed by grunewald and the second author in @xcite to produce arithmetic quotients of @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , it is shown there that @xmath52 is large .",
    "our starting point to prove theorem [ thm : metabelian 3 ] is the observation that the same proof shows also that @xmath50 is large .    in our proof of theorem [ thm:.metabelian 2 ]",
    ", the largeness of @xmath53 is also playing a crucial role .",
    "but , a word of warning is needed here : largeness of @xmath54 by itself is not sufficient to deduce negative answer for the csp for @xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xmath46 is large and has an affermative answer for the csp . at the same time , as mentioned above , @xmath52 is large and we do not know whether @xmath55 has the congruence subgroup property or not .",
    "to prove theorem [ thm : metabelian 3 ] we use the largeness of @xmath50 combined with the fact that every non - abelian finite simple group which is involved in @xmath56 is already involved in @xmath57 for some finite commutative ring @xmath58 , as we will show below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in @xmath59[sec : scp f2 ] we give a short proof for theorem [ thm : free 2 ] and in @xmath59[sec : csp meta 2 ] for theorem [ thm:.metabelian 2 ] .",
    "the @xmath60 section is devoted to prove theorem [ thm : metabelian 3 ] .",

    "before we start , let us quote some general propositions which bux - ershov - rapinchuk bring throughout their paper .",
    "let : @xmath61 be an exact sequence of groups .",
    "assume that @xmath62 is finitely generated and that the center of its profinite completion @xmath63 is trivial .",
    "then , the sequence of the profinite completions @xmath64 is also exact .",

    "we start now with the following lemma whose easy proof is left to the reader :    [ lem : cong - sub]let @xmath72 be a congruence subgroup . then : @xmath73 in particular , the map @xmath74 is injective if and only if the map @xmath75 is injective .",
    "denote now @xmath76 = the free group on @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it is a well known theorem of nielsen ( cf .",
    "@xcite , 3.5 ) that the kernel of the natural surjective map : @xmath79 is @xmath80 , the inner automorphism group of @xmath10 .",
    "it is also well known that the group @xmath81 is free on two generators and of finite index in @xmath82 which contains @xmath83 .",
    "now , if we denote the preimage of @xmath84 under the map @xmath85 by @xmath86 , then @xmath86 is of finite index in @xmath46 and contains the principal congruence subgroup : @xmath87 so , by lemma [ lem : cong - sub ] it is enough to prove that @xmath88 is injective .",
    "now , by the description above , we deduce the exact sequence : @xmath89 as @xmath84 is free , this sequence splits by the map : @xmath90 and thus : @xmath91 . by propositions [ prop : ber - exact ] and [ prop : ber - f2 ] , the exact sequence : @xmath92 yields the exact sequence : @xmath93 which gives : @xmath94 thus , all we need to show is that the following map is injective : @xmath95    we will prove this , in three parts : the first part is that the map @xmath96 is injective , but this is obvious as @xmath97 is mapped isomorphically to @xmath98 .",
    "the second part is to show that the map @xmath99 is injective , and the last part is to show that the intersection of the images of @xmath100 and @xmath101 in @xmath102 is trivial , i.e. @xmath103 .",
    "+ so it remains to prove the next two lemmas , lemma [ lem : main - lemma ] and lemma [ lem : part 3 ] :    [ lem : main - lemma]the map @xmath104 is injective .    before proving the lemma , we recall a classical result of schreier :    [ thm : schreier ] let @xmath65 be the free group on the set @xmath4 where @xmath105 , and @xmath106 a subgroup of @xmath65 of index @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath108 be a right schreier transversal of @xmath106 ( i.e. a system of representatives of right cosets containing the identity , such that the initial segment of any element of @xmath108 is also in @xmath108 ) . then :    \\1 .",

    "we also have : @xmath117 , and therefore , there is a natural homomorphism : @xmath118 which induces the composition @xmath119 .",
    "thus , it is enough to show that the composition map @xmath120 is injective .",
    "now , let @xmath121 and @xmath122 be a right schreier transversal of @xmath106 . by applying the second part of theorem [ thm : schreier ] for @xmath4 and @xmath108",
    ", we get the following set of free generators for @xmath106 : @xmath123    hence , the automorphisms @xmath124 and @xmath125 act on @xmath106 in the following way : @xmath126    let us now define the map @xmath127 ( yes ! these are the same @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) by the following way : @xmath128    it is easy to see that @xmath129 is the normal subgroup of @xmath106 generated as a normal subgroup by @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and that @xmath132 is invariant under the action of the automorphisms @xmath124 and @xmath125 , since : @xmath133 @xmath134    therefore , the homomorphism @xmath120 induces a homomorphism : @xmath135 , and thus it is enough to show that the last map is injective .",
    "now , under this map , @xmath124 and @xmath125 act on @xmath136 in the following way : @xmath137    namely , @xmath124 and @xmath125 act via @xmath138 on @xmath101 by the inner automorphisms @xmath124 and @xmath125 and hence @xmath101 is mapped isomorphically to @xmath139 , yielding that the map @xmath135 is injective and @xmath104 is injective as well , as required .",
    "[ lem : part 3]@xmath103 , where @xmath99 is the map defined above .",
    "first we observe that @xmath124 and @xmath125 fix @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "thus , by the second part of proposition [ prop : ber - f2 ] , we have : @xmath141\\right)\\right)=\\overline{\\left\\langle inn\\left([y , x]\\right)\\right\\rangle } = \\overline{\\left\\langle inn\\left(e_{2}\\right)\\right\\rangle } .\\ ] ]    now , as @xmath142 , where @xmath138 is as defined in the proof of lemma [ lem : main - lemma ] , the image of @xmath143 in @xmath139 is trivial .",
    "thus , the image of @xmath144 in @xmath139 is trivial , and isomorphic to @xmath144 as we saw that @xmath145 is mapped isomorphically to @xmath139 .",
    "so @xmath144 is trivial .",
    "this finishes the proof of theorem [ thm : free 2 ] . in @xcite ,",

    "but @xmath142 , so @xmath189 acts on @xmath201 as @xmath202 for some @xmath196 .",
    "now , by the definition of @xmath132 , @xmath203 and also @xmath204 , so @xmath189 acts on @xmath205 as @xmath206 for some @xmath207 .",
    "moreover , by the definition of @xmath138 we have @xmath208 and by the computations we made in the proof of lemma [ lem : main - lemma ] , @xmath189 acts on @xmath136 as @xmath209 .",
    "thus , there exists some @xmath207 such that @xmath210 acts trivially on @xmath211 , i.e. @xmath212 .",

    "thus , @xmath217 , as required .",
    "in this section we will prove theorem [ thm:.metabelian 2 ] , and will show that the congruence kernel of the free metabelian group on two generators is the free profinite group on a countable number of generators .",
    "before we start , let us observe that for a group @xmath0 , one can also ask a parallel congruence subgroup problem for @xmath218 . i.e. one can ask whether every finite index subgroup of @xmath24 contains a principal congruence subgroup of the form : @xmath219 for some finite index characteristic subgroup @xmath220 . when @xmath0 is finitely generated , this is equivalent to the question whether the congruence map @xmath221 is injective . moreover , it is easy to see that lemma [ lem : cong - sub ] has a parallel version for @xmath24 , namely , if @xmath222 is a congruence subgroup of @xmath24 , then : @xmath223    we start now with the next proposition which is slightly more general than lemma 3.1 . in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is proven by the same arguments :    let @xmath0 be a finitely generated residually finite group such that @xmath224 has a trivial center .",
    "considering the congruence map @xmath225 , we have : @xmath226    it is well known that @xmath6 is a residually finite group ( cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem 2.11 ) .",
    "it is also proven there that @xmath227 is trivial ( proposition 2.10 ) .",
    "so by the above proposition : @xmath228    in addition , it is an old result by bachmuth @xcite that the kernel of the surjective map : @xmath229 i.e. , @xmath230 .",
    "now , the free group @xmath84 is a congruence subgroup of @xmath231 as it contains : @xmath232 so by the appropriate version of lemma [ lem : cong - sub ] and by proposition [ prop : out - aut ] , we obtain that : @xmath233    now , as @xmath84 is a free group , we can also state that : @xmath234 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the automorphisms of @xmath10 that we defined in the previous section , which are the preimages of @xmath235 and @xmath236 under the map @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "so all we need to show is that :    [ lem:.main - meta-2]@xmath237 .    as the free group @xmath84 is a congruence subgroup of the group @xmath238 , we have : @xmath239 thus , if we denote : @xmath240 , then using equation ( [ eq : ( * ) ] ) , we have : @xmath241 .",
    "now , if we consider the action of @xmath242 on @xmath243 by conjugation , then as @xmath244 is abelian , we actually obtain an action on @xmath244 as a @xmath245=\\mathbb{z}[\\hat{\\mathbb{z}}^{2}]$]-module , which is generated by the element @xmath191 $ ] as a @xmath246$]-module , since @xmath247=1\\right\\rangle $ ] is a presentation of @xmath248 .",
    "moreover , as we observed previously , @xmath124 and @xmath125 fix @xmath191 $ ]",
    ". therefore , @xmath249 acts trivially not only on @xmath250 but also on @xmath244 .",
    "let us now make the following observation : if @xmath251 are two automorphisms of a group @xmath0 which act trivially on @xmath252 and on @xmath34 , where @xmath253 is abelian , then @xmath187 and @xmath254 commute .",
    "indeed , if @xmath255 , then @xmath256 and @xmath257 for some @xmath258 , and thus : @xmath259    the conclusion from the above observation and from the previous discussion is that @xmath260 is abelian , and thus , @xmath261 is also abelian .",

    "our proof of theorem [ thm:.metabelian 2 ] is much shorter than the one given in @xcite , but the latter gives more information .",

    "thus , @xmath274 is generated as a free abelian group by the images : @xmath275 now , the action of @xmath55 on @xmath58 by conjugation induces an action of @xmath276 on @xmath277 , sending : @xmath278 the above matrix has two eigenvalues @xmath279 and the eigenspaces are : @xmath280    recall , @xmath281 , and as @xmath282 is abelian , @xmath283 is metabelian .",
    "thus , we have a surjective homomorphism : @xmath284 .",
    "denote now : @xmath285 , so we can identify : @xmath286 , @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",

    "thus , there is a linear combination @xmath513 now , observe that @xmath514 acts on @xmath492 by conjugation via the action of @xmath515 on @xmath487 .",
    "thus , we obtain an action of @xmath516 on @xmath492 via its action on @xmath487 , in which @xmath517 has @xmath518 in every entry except the first one .",
    "this shows , as @xmath487 is irreducible , that the first copy of @xmath487 in @xmath492 is inside the group generated by @xmath514 and @xmath519 . in a similar way ,",
    "all the @xmath520 copies of @xmath487 are generated by @xmath514 and @xmath519 , so @xmath0 is generated by two elements .",
    "let us remark that while we do not know the answer to the congruence subgroup problem for free solvable groups on two generators and solvability rank @xmath409 ( unless @xmath525 or @xmath267 ) , the situation with free nilpotent groups on two generators is easier :      it is known that if @xmath224 is a pro - nilpotent group , then the kernel of the map @xmath526 is pro - nilpotent ( cf .",
