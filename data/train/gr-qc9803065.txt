    "when i was asked to give this plenary lecture in place of ashoke sen , i had some considerable misgivings that i would be able to do the subject the justice that he would undoubtedly have .",
    "however i had no doubts about what i should speak .",
    "the subject formerly known as string theory , and increasingly frequently being referred to as m - theory , has made some stunning advances since gr14 .",
    "hence my title .",
    "i should perhaps apologize , especially in india , for its wording .",
    "this was dreamed up rather hurriedly to meet the printer s deadline . as far as physics",
    "is concerned it would be more accurate to refer to the fourth , fifth or sixth millennium since the mathematical study of physics and astronomy must be at least as old as the the great river valley civilizations associated with the indus , tigris and euphrates .",
    "however coming as i do from a a rather obscure corner of north - western europe i had , when i gave my title to the organizers , very much in mind the forthcoming christian millennium celebration and its immediate predecessor .",
    "that earlier occasion provides an apt metaphor for the current activity in this subject : it resembles in many ways the construction of the great mediaeval cathedrals which followed the failure of the universe to live up to the most important cosmological prediction of those times , that it should come to an end in the year 1000 ad , thus appearing to demonstrate that physics is invariant under arbitrary shifts of the origin of the time coordinate .    like string theory , the construction of the great cathedrals was a collective endeavour which took literally ages to complete , in many cases centuries .",
    "although the beauty of the individual elements of the design would have been apparent fairly immediately , few if any of those working on the project at the beginning would have had much idea of the final shape of the structure that eventually emerged and which now combines those individual elements in such a harmonious whole .",
    "sometimes , as in the case of beauvais in northern france , the whole building fell crashing down and had to be completely rebuilt .",
    "in fact these cathedrals were frequently located on the sites of much earlier churches or indeed pre - christian temples often going back to the romans and before . walking around",
    "one sometimes finds , embedded in the floor or the lower parts of the wall fragments of these older structures put to a new use .",
    "@xmath0    much of this , it seems to me is true of the present state of string theory , only slowly are we beginning to get some idea of the final structure .",
    "even now we ca nt be sure that it will hold up .",
    "there is another , and more particular , way in which string theory resembles the mediaeval cathedrals .",
    "one of the key features of many of them is is the existence of a spire placed on top of a high tower .",
    "if one visits the cathedral one may climb to the top of the tower and then one may ascend the spire to gain a spectacular view of the surrounding countryside , the city and the cathedral precincts below .    for us",
    "the analogue of height above ground level is spacetime dimension and this brings me to what is perhaps the most important message of this talk :    really !",
    "the word really \" is meant in the technical sense : the point is that we need to consider spinors in eleven dimensional spacetime and it is a useful and convenient fact that the real clifford algebra    ( 10,1 ; r ) ( 32 ) .    what is meant here that in eleven spacetime dimensions the algebra generated by the gamma matrices @xmath1 , @xmath2 _ _ + _ _ = 2 _ , with spacetime signature chosen so that _ 0 ^ 2 = -1 , is isomorphic to that of @xmath3 real matrices .",
    "thus we may take the gamma matrices @xmath4 be @xmath5 and they act on the real @xmath6-dimensional space @xmath7 consisting of _ majorana spinors _",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the space of majorana spinors @xmath7 carries a @xmath10-invariant symplectic form @xmath11 , the _ charge conjugation matrix _ , which may be used to raise and lower spinor indices .",
    "thus for example one finds that if one lowers an index on the gamma matrices they become _ symmetric _ : ( c ^ ) _ ab = ( c ^ ) _ ba .    for later use",
    "we remark that we must make an arbitrary choice when constructing the clifford algebra @xmath12 .",
    "the image in the clifford algebra of the volume form commutes with all other elements of the algebra and may be taken to be a multiple of the identity .",
    "we make the choice : _ 10= _ 0 _ 1  _ 9 ( we could have chosen the minus sign ) .",
    "now let s look down to four dimensions .",
    "using the major arithmetical theorem that 32 = 4 8 , we see that @xmath7 we will decompose into eight copies of the four real dimensional space of majorana spinors for @xmath13 , and in a like fashion the eleven - dimensional charge conjugation matrix decomposes into the sum of eight copies of the familiar charge conjugation matrix of ordinary physics .",
    "we are in fact using the isomorphism    ( 3,1 ; r ) ( 4 ) .",
    "many participanrts at gr15 will be more familiar with weyl spinors and perhaps with the opposite signature convention . in that language",
    "a majorana spinor is a pair of two - complex -component weyl spinors while c= with ^= .",
    "let s return to eleven dimensions .",
    "supersymmetry transformations depend on a constant spinor @xmath14 and act on _ superspace _ , which is defined to be ^10,1 s with coordinates @xmath15 as    + x^x^+ 12 ^t c ^.    one now takes a suitably graded semi - direct product with the eleven dimensional poincar group @xmath16 to get the super - poincar group .",
    "note that the spinors @xmath17 and @xmath14 are anti - commuting variables .",
    "the supertranslations have generators @xmath18 which transform as majorana spinors under the super - adjoint action of spin(10,1 ) and trivially under the adjoint action of the ordinary spacetime translations .",
    "the non - trivial anti - commutation relation is , in index notation , q_a q_b + q_b q_a = p _ ( c^ ) _ ab .",
    "descending to four dimensions we get eight four - component supercharges @xmath19 and the algebra of @xmath20 supersymmetry .",
    "given the above information it is in principle possible to construct classical field theories in eleven dimensions .",
    "however any such theory must contain particles of spin two and it is widely believed that _ there is only one possibility _ , the theory of cremmer and julia @xcite .",
    "this contains g _",
    "f_[]= 4 _ [ a _ ] and a ^a _ .",
    "an elementary exercise in linear theory shows that there are 128 boson and 128 fermion degrees of freedom .    in higher dimensional lorentzian spacetimes , or in eleven dimensions but with more supersymmetry , particles with spins greater than two seem to be inevitable .",
    "that is why at present the pinnacle of the spire stops here .",
    "however that has not dissuaded modern - day icari ( if indeed that is the plural of icarus ) from launching themselves into the blue yonder .",
    "future architectural innovations may well include multi - temporal theories in twelve or thirteen dimensions .",
    "those with little head for heights may descend the spire to the tower where life is more varied . we still have @xmath6 component since _ 10 ^ 2 = ( _ 0  _ 9 ) ^2 = 1 we may decompose the real @xmath6-dimensional space @xmath7 of majorana spinors into two real @xmath21 dimensional spaces @xmath22 of _ majorana - weyl _",
    "spinors s= s^+ s^- with _ 10 s^= s^.",
    "we now have _ three _ types of superymmetry and three types of superspace depending upon the chirality of the supercharges .",
    "* type i theories have just one supercharge and is therefore necessarily chiral .",
    "the superspace is ^9,1 s^+ .",
    "* type iia theories have two supercharges , one of each chirality .",
    "the superspace is",
    "^9,1 s^+ s^- . *",
    "type iib theories have two supercharges of the same chirality , and are thus also chiral .",
    "the superspace is ^9,1",
    "s^+ s^+ .",
    "these include    * super - yang - mills theory .",
    "this has f _ and both in the adjoint representation of some compact gauge group @xmath23 . in many ways",
    "this is the big - daddy of all gauge theories .",
    "for example , this theory , reduced to four spacetime dimensions , gives the @xmath24 supersymmetric yang - mills theory which has so many deep and beautiful links with mathematics and geometry .",
    "we shall see shortly that it has a central role to play in m - theory .",
    "* type i supergravity .",
    "this has as bosonic fields g _ and h_= 3 _ [ a _ ] . * the @xmath25 open superstring .",
    "these include    * type iia supergravity .",
    "+ this has the bosonic fields of type i supergravity , referred to in this context as the _ neveu - schwarz@xmath26neveu - schwarz sector _ together with a closed two - form and a closed four - form field strength , referred to in this context as the _ ramond@xmath26ramond sector_. + and * the type iia closed superstring .",
    "these include    * type iib supergravity .",
    "this has the bosonic fields of type i supergravity , often called for obvious reasons , the common sectortogether with a ramond@xmath26ramond sector consisting of closed one , three and five - forms .",
    "the five - form @xmath27 is self - dual c_5 = c_5 , where @xmath28 denotes the hodge - dual which satisfies @xmath29 in @xmath30 . *",
    "the type iib closed superstring .      for closed strings ,",
    "one has the additional possibility of the left and right moving modes on the string behaving differently and this gives rise to the two further possibilities with gauge group @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "it is of the course the latter which has received most attention for phenomonological purposes .",
    "we get down to four dimensions with @xmath33 supersymmetry by taking the ten dimensional spacetime @xmath34 as a product ^9,1= e^3,1 cy where @xmath35 is a calabi - yau space , i.e. a closed riemannian six - manifold with holonomy @xmath36 .",
    "thus , if one regards the field theories as limiting low - energy cases of super - string theories one has five possibilities .",
    "the next most important point of this lecture is that .5 cm    = 10000    .5 cm    called    .5 cm    .5 cm    @xmath37    the five string theories and eleven - dimensional supergravity are conjectured to be related by a web of _ dualities _ which interchange the perturbative _ elementary _ states which we encounter in linear theory with the non - perturbative _ bps soliton _ states which we only see in the fully non - linear theory .",
    "i will have more to say about what precisely m - theory is expected to be later .",
    "the basic dualities are of two types referred to as _ t - dualities _ and _ s - dualities_. they are believed to be combined in a more general symmetry called _",
    "u - duality_.      these are symmetries of perturbative string theory and may be shown to hold to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "they appear when one considers theories for which ^9,1= t^d ^9-d,1 .",
    "the torus is equipped with a constant metric @xmath38 and a constant two - form @xmath39 and t - duality is a generalization of the idea of interchanging the torus , equipped and its metric @xmath40 with its dual or reciprocal torus and its dual or reciprocal metric @xmath41 .",
    "a familar example of this in the everday physics of three dimensions is the duality between the face centred cubic lattice and the body centred cubic lattice .",
    "the voronoi or wigner - seitz cell of the former is the rhombic dodecahedron whose dual is the cuboctahedron , which is the voronoi cell of the latter .",
    "string theories related by duality are believed to be identical . in other words",
    "it is one of the gauge symmetries of string theory , the simplest example arises when we have a a circle @xmath42 of radius @xmath43 and t - duality acts as r , where @xmath44 is the fundamental length that enters string theory .",
    "more generally , the moduli spaceof torus theories is specified by giving a @xmath45 matrix @xmath46 with positive definite symmetric part is acted on by @xmath47 acting by fractional linear transformations    e ( ae + b ) ( c e + d)^-1 where , if m= and j= , then m^t j m = j.      the group in question is @xmath48 it is is a new and unexpected non - perturbative symmetry of string theory interchanging weak and strong coupling whose existence and importance was pointed out by ashoke sen @xcite and who has used it so effectively .",
    "perhaps its most exciting feature is that it also interchanges classical with quantum properties .",
    "s - duality is not all apparent in perturbative string theory , it only manifests itself indirectly .",
    "thus in n=4 supersymmetric four - dimensional gauge theory , if = 2 + 4 i g^2 where @xmath49 is the usual gauge coupling constant and @xmath50 is the theta angles - duality acts by fractional linear transformations where sl(2 , z ) .",
    "gauge theories with couplings so related are believed to be identical .",
    "no proof is known but many , apparently rather delicate , tests have been made of this conjecture and no contradiction has been found .",
    "in fact these tests involve extremely subtle and unexpected properties of the @xmath51 co - homology of the hyper - khler manifolds which are the moduli spaces of bps monopoles @xcite .",
    "in string theory and supergravity theory we have g= e^ and the role of @xmath50 is played by a pseudoscalar field called an axion .",
    "thus for example it is known that @xmath52 is a symmetry of type iib classical supergravity theory .",
    "the exterior derivative of the axion is the closed ramond@xmath26ramond one - form mentioned earlier .",
    "it is expected that quantum - mechanical effects associated with dirac quantization of electric and magnetic charges will break this continuous symmetry down to @xmath53 .    by dimensional reduction on tori",
    "the s - duality symmetry descends to lower - dimensional super - gravity theories .",
    "of course they also acquire an explicit ( and continuous ) t - duality symmetry as well .",
    "studies of super - gravity theories in the past revealed that one often gets more .",
    "for example the @xmath20 supergravity theory in four spacetime dimensions is invariant under the action of @xmath54 .",
    "hull and townsend @xcite have suggested that a discrete subgroup of @xmath54 should persist in the full quantum mechanical m - theory .",
    "the non - perturbative soliton states , analogous to bps monopoles in yang - mills theory , which are acted on by non - perturbative dualities correspond to _ p - branes_. roughly speaking these are extended objects with p spatial dimensions which as they move through time draw out a p+1 dimensional world volume .",
    "thus in @xmath55 spacetime dimensions p&=&0 + p&=&1 + p&=&2 + p&=&n-2 + p&=&n-3 + p&=&-1",
    "+    one says that a p - brane state @xmath56 is bps if is invariant under one or more supersymmetry transformations q |p = 0 .",
    "bps states typically carry central charges @xmath57 per unit p - volume and if if @xmath58 is the energy per unit p - volume of such a state it typically attains a _ bogomolnyi bound _ @xcite giving a lower bound for @xmath58 among all states with the same central charge m |z| .",
    "in supergravity theories bps p - branes are very well known to the present audience .",
    "they correspond to extreme black holes and higher dimensional analogues .",
    "the spacetime of such a solution is invariant under the action of the poincar group @xmath59 times rotations of the @xmath60 dimensional transverse space @xmath61 .",
    "i wo nt give a complete survey of all possibilities but remind you that a typical metric looks like : ds^2 = h^-2 p+1 ( -dt^2 + d*x*_p^2 ) + h^ 2 d_t-2 d*y*_t^2 ,    where @xmath62 is an arbitrary harmonic function on @xmath63 .",
    "thus more than one p - brane may rest in equipoise .",
    "the solutions admit killing spinors of the relevant supergravity theory .    near the horizons ,",
    "the symmetry and the superymmetry is frequently enhanced , the metric tending to the product @xmath64 .",
    "typically one may think of the p - branes as spatially interpolating between different vacua or compactifications of the associated supergravity theories .",
    "the basic and fundamental example is of course the majumdar - papapetrou solution of the einstein - maxwell equations in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "it is important to note that supergravity p - branes may carry electric or magnetic charges .",
    "associated to a @xmath65- form or @xmath66 form respectively .",
    "the magnetic charges are necessarily solitonic , while the electric ones may sometimes be envisaged as arising from sources . in general charges",
    "may be of neveu - schwarz@xmath26neveu - schwarz or ramond@xmath26 ramond origin .",
    "in string theory electric neveu - schwarz@xmath26neveu - schwarz charge is carried by a _ fundamental string _ which corresponds to an elementary state of string theory .",
    "however perturbative string states can not carry magnetic neveu - schwarz@xmath26 neveu - schwarz charge neither can they carry electric or magnetic ramond@xmath26 ramond charge .",
    "there are no such local sources in perturbative string theory .",
    "we have here a case of what misner and wheeler might have called    note that in the quantum theory these charges should satisfy an analogue of dirac s quantization condition for electric andc magnetic charges .    it is perhaps worth explaining here the origin of the rather quaint looking tensor product notation .",
    "it derives form the fact that a the world sheet of a closed string is topologically @xmath67 which admits two spin structures ,    * neveu - schwarz , which corresponds to antiperiodic spinors + and * ramond , which corresponds to periodic spinors ,    and both must be included when considering the fermionic oscillations of the superstring .",
    "the bosonic fields are built up as tensor products of left and right moving fermionic states , and must be periodic .",
    "they thus fall into two sectors .",
    "shifting now to ten - dimensional spacetime we see that the fermionic states will be associated with the tensor product of the space of majorana spinors with itself i.e. with @xmath68 .",
    "but by virtue of the charge conjugation matrix @xmath69 we may identify @xmath70 with the clifford algebra @xmath71 which , as a vector space is the same as the grassmann algebra of forms @xmath72 .",
    "type iia theories involve the even forms and type iib theories the odd forms .",
    "a key observation of polchinski @xcite , which resolves the puzzle above , is that open string theory admits an entirely new type of state corresponding to p - branes .",
    "they have come to be called _",
    "dirichlet p - branes_. their importance is that their quantum mechanical properties can be discussed within the comparitively mathematically secure framework of conformal field theory .",
    "the basic idea is consider decomposing ten - dimensional minkowski spacetime as ^9,1 = e^p,1 ^d_t with coordinates @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we now decree that end of the the string remains fixed on the hyperplane @xmath76 . in other words the coordinates of the string fields @xmath77 , where @xmath78 are space and time coordinates on the string world sheet are to be subjected to a mixture of the usual    * neumann boundary conditions _ x^=0 and * dirichlet boundary conditions _",
    "t y^a=0 .",
    "note that world sheet hodge duality interchanges @xmath79 and @xmath80 and hence neuman and dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "polchinksi was able to show that in string theory such d - brane states are bps and like their supergravity cousins they carry the correct ramond@xmath26ramond charges .",
    "moreover these charges satisfy the analogue of dirac quantization conditions , called in this context the _ nepomechie - teitelboim _ quantization conditions .",
    "we may suppose that integrating over the string fluctuations will give an effective action for for the motion of light p - branes moving in a a fixed external field .",
    "such so - called _ dirac - born - infeld _ actions have been obtained by a number of authors .",
    "in addition to the world volume fields giving the embedding of the brane in @xmath30 , @xmath81 susy dictates that one must include a world volume closed two - form @xmath82 .",
    "in flat space with trivial ramond@xmath26ramond and neveu - schwarz@xmath26neveu - schwarz fields dirac - born - infeld action reduces to - d^p+1x , where g _ = _ z^x",
    "^ z^x ^ is the pull - back to the world volume of the flat ten - dimensional metric @xmath83 .",
    "it is perhaps a striking fact that we encounter here embedded in the structure of m - theory a a fragment of the old , an unsuccessful , attempt of born and infeld to construct a finite classical theory of the electron .",
    "now is not the place to dwell on this in detail but it is a striking consequence of the new developments that what was a major blemish of the that ancient religion : the singular source of the electron may now be understood as the end of a fundamental string ending on a d - brane @xcite .",
    "i have no time to dwell at length on the details but it is perhaps worth pointing out here the simple underlying idea that permits the construction of superymmetric p - brane actions , including super - string actions , in a unified way . it is to to replace the bosonic idea of a map from a @xmath84 dimensional manifold of the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the p - brane s spatial manifold by into spacetime , @xmath87 for example , by a map into superspace @xmath88 .",
    "perhaps the most persuasive evidence for the essential soundness of our current foundation is the remarkable calculations of the thermal properties of black holes initiated by strominger and vafa @xcite and developed further by callan and maldacena @xciteand then by many other people @xcite . both for reasons of time and",
    "because there have been some been some fine expositions inthe parallel sessions , i shall not review them in detail but merely note some essential points .      the first thing to remind ourselves",
    "is why this idea is even feasible without a complete quantum theory of gravity . for a general black hole , the bekenstein - hawking entropy s_bh= 14 g a where @xmath89 is the horizon area .",
    "this expression involves newton s constant @xmath23 . in string theory",
    "we expect that g so that @xmath23 should depend on the expectation value of the dilaton @xmath90 . at present",
    "this seems to be a completely arbitrary number depending on which vacuum we are in and to be quite beyond calculation .",
    "however for an extreme black hole , for example an electric majumdar - papapetrou black hole , we have a = 4 ( gm)^2 and moreover g m^2 q^2 where @xmath91 is the electric charge , ( not the supercharge ! ) . thus s= q^2 which does depend upon @xmath23 at all , only on the quantized dimensionless and essentially topological quantity @xmath91 .",
    "the same feature may be shown to be true for all extreme black holes with non - vanishing entropy , both in four and five spacetime dimensions @xcite .",
    "the entropy is independent of any accidential moduli fields characterizing the vacuum we are in but depends only on dimensionless quantized charges .",
    "in fact this is a rather general statement and does not depend upon string theory in an essential way , just the general structure of the low energy effective lagrangians .",
    "the reason that one is so interested in bps states in any theory is that they are typically protected against quantum corrections .",
    "in particular the number of states in a super - multiplet is fixed by the bogomolnyi condition @xmath92 .",
    "thus properties of bps states at weak coupling should remain true at strong coupling .    in other words quantum mechanical string or strictly speaking d - brane calculations",
    "should and indeed do agree with semi - classical calculations in supergravity theories .",
    "this is particularly to be expected for calculations of the number of bps states , i.e. of the entropy of extreme black holes .",
    "thus the basic idea is that counts the number @xmath93 of microstates of a certian bps configuration of d - branes having certain charges @xmath94 using techniques from conformal field theory and hence the entropy s_d = n. in fact no great sophistication is needed for these calculations , they simply involve a one - dimensional gas .",
    "one now constructs a fully non - linear bps supergravity solution with the same charges representing an extreme black hole .",
    "one calculates the area of the horizon and hence its bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath95 .",
    "then one compares and @xmath96 . in the limit of large charges one gets exact agreement , in other words the factor of proportionality is correct .",
    "this distinguishes this calculation from almost every other similar non - stringy calculation in four or five dimensions .",
    "the simplest example involves five - dimensional black holes which may be thought of as 1-brane lying inside a five - brane and carrying kaluza - klein momentum .",
    "there are three charges , which count the number of one branes . the number of five - branes and the kaluza - klein momentum of the string .",
    "more testing calculations can be done giving complete agreement with the emission rates , including grey - body factors , in the limit of low frequency for slightly non - extreme holes .",
    "in fact the absorption cross - sections of black holes at zero frequency are universal and always given in terms of the area @xcite but at non - zero frequency this is no longer so but nevertheless the emission rates continue to agree . in fact these calculations may be extended to strongly non - extreme holes but perhaps not surprisingly some small discrepancies have emerged but these may quite plausibly be ascribed to extending the approximation beyond its reasonably expected range of validity .",
    "i personally have found these results to be tremendously impressive and at face value they constitute good evidence for the ultimate promise of the string / m - theory project .",
    "what then is m - theory ?",
    "the letter m has variously been claimed to stand for membrane , magic , mystery or mother ( as in mother of all theories ) but since no - one at present has a definitive theory the question of the name should presumably remain in abeyance .",
    "perhaps the snappiest characterization is    .",
    "m - theory is the strong coupling limit of type iia string theory .",
    "however this is rather non - constructive ( in the pure mathematical sense ) ans something more concrete is desirable . to see why it is reasonable however ,",
    "consider passing between      this is done by compactification on a circle of radius @xmath97 @xmath98    eleven dimensional supergravity then gives rise to type iia supergravity with its dilaton @xmath90 coming form the matric component @xmath99 .",
    "standard kaluaz - klein calculations lead to the relation    r_10= l_planck < e^ 23 > where @xmath100 is the eleven dimensional planch length . now in string terms the string coupling constant @xmath101 is given by    g_string= < e ^ >    and = g_string^ 13 .",
    "it follows @xcite that weak string coupling corresponds to a small string circle and strong coupling to a large circle . thus if one starts from type iia string theory and increases the coupling constant one expects to arrive at an effectively eleven dimensional theory .",
    "the situation in the definition is summarized in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      one of the conjectured dualities relates m - theory to the @xmath31 heterotic theory compactified on a calabi yau manifold @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to consider ^10,1 = i cy where @xmath102 is a closed interval which may be thought of as a circle @xmath103 identified under reflection about a diameter .",
    "the reflection has two fixed points at the ends of the interval .",
    "thus the universe looks like a sandwich consisting of two ten dimensional sheets bounding an eleven - dimensional bulk spacetime .",
    "one @xmath104 gauge field lives on one sheet and the second factor on the other sheet .",
    "the size of the interval is taken to be rather larger than the size of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "this gives improved phenomonological models .",
    "ihe separations of scales also suggests that one one might be able to study the era of compactification , if indeed compactification ever took place , about which almost nothing is known or conjectured , as a two step process in which one ignores the formation of the calabi - yau and considers a compactification from five to four spacetime dimensions on an interval .",
    "in asking what kind of theory m - theory can be it is natural to ask what sort of superymetric p - branes it admits .    to answer this question recall @xcite that in any spacetime dimension @xmath55",
    "one may consider a modification of the superysymmetry algebra by adding something to the right hand side of the basic anti - commutation relation q_aq_b + q_bq_a = p_(c^ ) _ ab + z_ab since @xmath105 is an element of the the clifford algebra @xmath106 it may also be thought of as an element of the grassman algebra of all p - forms @xmath107 .",
    "thus z_ab = _ p1 1p ! z__1 ",
    "_ p ( c ) ^_1  _ p ) _ ab .",
    "the bosonic quantities @xmath108}$ ] may be thought of in general non - lorentz - invariant charges per unit p - volume carried by p - branes states .",
    "thus a p - branes lying in the @xmath109 plane is associated with the clifford algebra element @xmath110 .    of course",
    "if @xmath111 or @xmath112 we recover the usual lorentz - invariant electric or magnetic central charges we are familiar in four - dimensional supergravity theories which are carried by @xmath113-branes , i.e. ordinary particles .",

    "in the final part of the lecture i want to turn to the only concrete proposal for what m - theory actually may be .",

    "there will no doubt be many dramatic twists and turns before the final shape of m - theory emerges .",
    "however what does now seem clear is that sufficiently many of the essential underlying ideas are in place to show that some definite structure will finally emerge and that it will be able to answer many of the questions that we would like to ask of a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "whether it is the theory that nature has adopted is a different matter .",
    "my own assessment is the situation is that it is rather analogous to that which prevailed after the discovery ( if you are , to use the language of scholastic philosophers , a realist ) or invention ( if your are a nominalist ) of riemannian geometry .",
    "this allowed the unification of the three non - euclidean geometries into a unified generalization .",
    "combined with the basic ideas of group theory this rapidly led to lie groups considered as riemannian manifolds and the classification of symmetric spaces .",

    "much of twentieth century mathematics has been preoccupied with these topics .    however , although some speculative applications of riemannian geometry to cosmography were rapidly forthcoming , it was not until einstein s work on special relativity that the essential _ phyiscal insight _ that _ time _ must also be included in the picture and his later idea of the _ equivalence principle _ that general relativity finally emerged and these earlier speculations became firmly emebeded in our cosmological world picture .",
    "it took even later for the development of quantum mechanics and the realization of the central role the khler geometry of the space of states to emerge together with the importance of of lie groups and their representations , leading eventually to gauge theory and our present standard model of particle interactions .    today",
    "we see that we have in hand the beginnings of a vast mathematical structure including in it all the mathematical ideas that we have found useful in physics in the past .",
    "already it is clear that the first three basic underlying physical principles are        experimental verification of supersymmetry in accelerators would be convincing evidence that the present chain of ideas is essentially correct , however we desperately need some more physical ideas .",
