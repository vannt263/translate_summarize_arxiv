    "the origin of high - velocity runaway stars can be attributed to two basic processes : ( i ) disruption of a tight massive binary following the ( asymmetric ) supernova explosion of one of the binary components ( blaauw @xcite ) and ( ii ) dynamical three- or four - body encounters in dense stellar systems ( poveda , ruiz & allen @xcite ) . in the first process , the maximum velocity attained by runaway stars depends on the magnitude of the kick imparted to the stellar supernova remnant [ either a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh ) ] and for reasonable values of this magnitude , the runaway velocity does not exceed @xmath8 ( e.g. portegies zwart @xcite ; cf .",
    "gvaramadze @xcite ) . in the second process",
    ", the ejection velocity could be higher .",
    "for example , the maximum velocity that a runaway star can attain in binary - binary encounters is equal to the escape velocity from the surface of the most massive star in the binaries and could be as large as @xmath9 ( leonard @xcite ) .    the recent discovery of the so - called hypervelocity stars ( hvss ; e.g. brown et al .",
    "@xcite )  the ordinary stars moving with velocities exceeding the milky way s escape velocity  attracted attention to dynamical processes involving the supermassive bh in the galactic centre ( e.g. gualandris , portegies zwart & sipior @xcite ; baumgardt , gualandris & portegies zwart @xcite ) .",
    "these processes [ originally proposed by hills ( @xcite ) and yu & tremaine ( @xcite ) ] can result in ejection velocities of several @xmath10 .",
    "similar processes but acting in the cores of young massive star clusters ( ymscs ) and involving dynamical encounters with intermediate - mass ( @xmath11 ) bhs ( imbhs ) were considered by gvaramadze , gualandris & portegies zwart ( @xcite ) to explain the origin of extremely high - velocity ( @xmath12 ) nss ( e.g. chatterjee et al .",
    "@xcite ) and hvss .",
    "gualandris & portegies zwart ( @xcite ) proposed that exchange encounters between hard binaries and an imbh formed in the core of a ymsc in the large magellanic cloud could be responsible for the origin of the hvs he0437@xmath135439 . a strong support to the possibility that at least some hvss originate in star clusters rather than in the galactic centre comes from the proper motion measurements for the hvs hd271791 , which constrain the birth place of this star to the outer parts of the galactic disc ( heber et al .",
    "in this paper , we explore the hypothesis ( gvaramadze @xcite ) that some high - velocity runaway stars could attain their peculiar velocities in the course of strong dynamical encounters between hard massive binaries and a very massive ( @xmath14 ) star ( vms ) , formed in the core of a ymsc through collisions and mergers of ordinary massive stars ( e.g. portegies zwart & mcmillan @xcite ) . in this process ,",
    "one of the binary components is replaced by the vms , while the second one is ejected ( the so - called exchange encounter ) , sometimes with a high velocity .",
    "our goal is to check whether or not this process can produce early b - type stars ( the progenitors of nss ) with velocities of @xmath0 ( typical of pulsars ) and @xmath15 stars with velocities of @xmath6 ( typical of some late b - type halo stars ) .    in our study",
    "we proceed from the similarity between encounters involving a vms and those involving an imbh ( the latter process is already known to be able to produce high - velocity runaways ; gvaramadze et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the fact that the radii of vmss are smaller than the tidal radii of the intruders ( the massive binaries ) , so that the tidal breakup and ejection can occur before the binary components merge with the vms ( gvaramadze @xcite ; gvaramadze et al .",
    "our study is motivated by the recent evolutionary models of vmss ( belkus et al .",
    "@xcite ; yungelson et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which suggest that vmss can lose most of their mass via copious winds and leave behind imbhs with masses of @xmath16 , which are not large enough to contribute significantly to the production of high - velocity runaway stars ( see gvaramadze et al .",
    "we therefore explore the possibility that a vms could produce high - velocity escapers ( either early or late b - type stars ) before it finished its life in a supernova and formed a bh . to check this possibility , we performed numerical simulations of three - body exchange encounters using the sigma3 package , which is part of the starlab software environment ( mcmillan & hut @xcite ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for a detailed description of the simulations",
    "see gvaramadze et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "first , we focus on exchange encounters producing high - velocity early b - type stars and simulate encounters between a binary consisting of two main - sequence stars with masses @xmath17 and @xmath18 and a massive compact body , either a vms or an ordinary star of mass of @xmath19 ( the most massive ordinary stars formed in clusters with mass of @xmath20 ; e.g. weidner , kroupa & bonnell @xcite ) . in order to maximize the ejection speed , we assume that the binary system is very tight , e.g. formed by tidal capture . in this case , @xmath21 au , where @xmath22 is the radius of the primary star ( see gvaramadze et al .",
    "fig.[fig : early ] ( left panel ) shows the velocity distribution for @xmath23 escapers . as expected , the more massive vmss are more likely to eject stars with high velocities . in the right panel of fig.[fig : early ] we show the probability of exchange encounters resulting in ejection of the @xmath23 binary component with a velocity from 200 to @xmath24 ( top to bottom ) . for @xmath25",
    "about @xmath26 per cent of all encounters produce runaways with peculiar velocities @xmath3 .",
    "it can be seen that even an ordinary star of mass of @xmath27 can occasionally ( in @xmath28 per cent of encounters ) produce an escape velocity @xmath3 . in order to produce escapers with velocities typical of hvss ( @xmath29 ) ,",
    "a vms of several hundred solar masses is required . in the case of a @xmath30 vms , @xmath31 per cent of all encounters result in an escape velocity of @xmath32 .",
    "this fraction gradually increases to @xmath33 per cent for the more massive vmss .",
    "next , we consider exchange encounters producing high - velocity late b - type stars and simulated encounters between a very tight binary ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 au ) and a ( very ) massive star of mass of @xmath37 .",
    "the velocity distributions for @xmath38 escapers are shown in fig.[fig : late ] ( left panel ) for four different values of the vms mass : @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig : late ] shows that for all values of @xmath41 about @xmath42 per cent of encounters results in peculiar velocities @xmath6 and that about the same percentage of ejected stars attains velocity @xmath7 if @xmath43 .",
    "we therefore argue that the origin of high - velocity ( @xmath44 ) early and late b - type runaway stars and at least some hvss could be associated with dynamical encounters between the tightest massive binaries and vmss formed in the cores of ymscs . the future proper motion measurements for hvss with gaia will reveal what fraction of these extremely high - velocity stars originated in the galactic disk .",
