    "the present article deals with the motion of an ordinary electrically charged particle in the background of a magnetic point source in three - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "such a source is the simplest case of what has been called recently a  magnetic event , \" a novel notion that emerges from the principle of electric - magnetic duality , and has been developed in @xcite . as it was discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this case is of interest , not only because of its simplicity , but also because it is realized in the laboratory when an electric charge crosses a josephson junction separating two superconducting bulk pieces .    to our knowledge",
    "this problem has not been discussed before , perhaps because a cogent physical motivation did not yet exist .    on the other hand , the corresponding problem of determining the spatial trajectories of an electrically charged particle in the field of a magnetic monopole in three - dimensional euclidean space ( i.e. , in _ four _ dimensional minkowski spacetime ) was first considered by poincar over 100 years ago @xcite , and there are many more recent treatments ( see , for example @xcite ) . in the euclidean case",
    "the spatial trajectories are spirals on a cone whose aperture is determined by the angular momentum .",
    "the cone becomes a plane when the magnetic pole is absent .    at the beginning of the present study",
    ", the authors felt that , perhaps , there would be a way of directly translating in a simple manner , by some sort of  wick rotation , \" the well - analyzed euclidean results to the case of lorentzian signature .",
    "however efforts in this direction proved unsuccessful .",
    "therefore it was decided to attack the problem directly , _ ab initio _ in minkowski space , and , as it will be seen below , the results that emerged appear to bear no evident relationship with those of the euclidean case .",
    "with hindsight , from a physical point of view the lack of such a relationship should not be that surprising but rather is to be expected .",
    "indeed , as emphasized in @xcite the magnetic pole in three - dimensional euclidean space corresponds to an  instanton \" @xcite , or  pseudo particle \" @xcite and describes quantum mechanical tunneling within the three - dimensional spacetime , while , in contradistinction , magnetic events occur classically and correspond to the imprint of a flux - carrying particle impinging from extra dimension .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] recalls the field of a magnetic event .",
    "next , sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] discusses a first integral of the equation of motion , in which the integration constants are the three conserved components of the angular momentum",
    ". then sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] is devoted to further complete integration of the equations of motion , for which we resort to numerical methods .",
    "it is observed that one must regularize the otherwise divergent field of the event on the light cone .",
    "the main conclusions obtained are independent of regularization and they are stated in sec . [ conclusion ] : as the electric charge crosses the light cone of the event it starts rotating and slowing down . in the frame",
    "in which the particle is initially at rest , after a time of the order of the spacetime impact parameter , the particle makes sharply a quarter of a turn and comes to rest at the same spatial position at which the event happened in the past .",
    "this jump is the main signature of the presence of the magnetic event as felt by an electric charge .",
    "a derivation of the expression for the angular momentum that uses noether s theorem in the magnetic representation is given in the appendix .",
    "the electromagnetic field strength @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 where the dual @xmath8 is related to the magnetic potential @xmath9 by @xmath10 if the event is at the origin @xmath11 , the equation of motion for @xmath9 reads , @xmath12 the general solution of  ( [ field ] ) is the sum @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the general solution of the homogeneous equation @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a green function of the wave operator . at the classical level",
    "a natural choice is to take for @xmath16 the retarded green function which vanishes outside the future light cone of the event , @xmath17 if one takes @xmath18 the situation as seen from within the @xmath19 spacetime is the following : for @xmath20 there is no field .  at @xmath21 ,",
    "suddenly a flash of light emerges and propagates to the future .",
    "as argued in @xcite this situation will be the most probable classically , because it corresponds to a flux - carrying particle impinging from the extra dimension without any precise control (  fine tuning \" ) of its initial conditions .",
    "the time - reversed process , where one would replace the retarded green function @xmath22 by the advanced one @xmath23 corresponds to a precisely prepared (  fine tuned \" ) pulse of radiation converging on the spacetime point @xmath24 , and disappearing as a flux - carrying particle into the extra dimension",
    ". this situation would be classically improbable .",
    "we will therefore set in ( [ strengthphi ] ) @xmath25",
    "the equations of motion for the electric charge in the background field of the magnetic event are given by the standard lorentz force , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the field given in the previous section .    because the field of the event is invariant under lorentz transformations",
    "the three components of the spacetime angular momentum , @xmath28 are conserved . just as it happens for an ordinary magnetic pole in three space dimensions",
    "( see for example @xcite , and appendix d of @xcite ) , the angular momentum eq .",
    "( [ j2 ] ) has a  spin \" piece additional to the orbital part .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , when the electric charge is within the future light cone of the magnetic event , we have @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the proper time . on the other hand , when the electric charge is not under the influence of the magnetic event one has just @xmath34 .",
    "we can always choose a lorentz frame in which , before reaching the future light cone of the event , the electric charge is at rest , at @xmath35 .",
    "then we have @xmath36 where we have set @xmath37 .    the value of @xmath38 given by eqs .",
    "( 12)(14 ) , which was arrived at by calculating it before the interaction begins , must also be valid afterward since the total angular momentum is conserved . as we shall see in sec .",
    "v , during the scattering process there will be an exchange of spacetime orbital angular momentum and spin so that the sum @xmath38 remains constant .",
    "it follows from eqs.(12)(14 ) that the conserved total angular momentum @xmath38 is a spacelike vector .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the worldline of the electrically charged particle is timelike .",
    "one could only arrange for a null , or timelike , @xmath38 by having a spacelike worldline for an electric charge , but this would not correspond to a physical particle .",
    "now , after the particle has entered the future light cone of the event , one has @xmath39 where we have denoted @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath38 is conserved and only @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 or @xmath43 with @xmath44    [ b ] . in this graph @xmath45 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    equation ( [ y ] ) may be written in parametric form as @xmath46 where @xmath9 is the polar angle in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "geometrically these equations describe half of the ellipsoid @xmath48 which is inscribed in the light cone of the event , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the half @xmath49 corresponds to @xmath50 , and the half @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "next we proceed to evaluate @xmath53 and @xmath54 after the electric charge starts feeling the field of the event .",
    "first we observe from ( [ y ] ) and ( [ py ] ) that @xmath55 then @xmath56 on the other hand , eqs . ( [ px ] ) and ( [ py ] ) yield for the orbital angular momentum @xmath57 now we demand that the total angular momentum be conserved .",
    "recalling eqs .",
    "( [ initial])(14 ) , the conservation equations read @xmath58 equation ( [ j2 ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath59 if ( [ equiv ] ) is inserted in ( [ j0 ] ) and ( [ j1 ] ) , the latter two equations are also satisfied",
    ". therefore relation ( [ equiv ] ) captures the full content of the angular momentum conservation .",
    "now @xmath60 which , combined with ( [ equiv ] ) , yields @xmath61   \\left ( t\\frac{d \\varphi } { dt}\\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & =   \\sin^2 \\varphi + 2 t \\frac{d \\varphi } { dt } \\cos \\varphi \\sin \\varphi .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing the dimensionless parameter @xmath62 through @xmath63 which implies @xmath64 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ dift ] ) as @xmath65 with @xmath66 the choice of a plus sign in ( [ segundo ] ) comes from ( [ equiv ] ) which show us that @xmath67 and @xmath68 have the same sign .",
    "equations ( [ px ] ) , ( [ py ] ) and ( [ segundo ] ) constitute a first integral of the equations of motion .",
    "we will exhibit in this section numerical results for the solution of the first - order differential equation ( [ segundo ] ) .",
    "the physical situation is that the particle is free up to the time @xmath69 , when it is first hit by the field of the event , and afterward it continues to move under its influence .",
    "now , if one were to assume  as one normally does  that the position of the particle is continuous , one would have that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ segundo ] ) would be @xmath70 for all times .",
    "however , if one introduces that result in eqs .",
    "( [ px ] ) and ( [ py ] ) , it follows that @xmath71 , @xmath72 , i.e. , the particle suddenly starts moving with the speed of light .",
    "this unphysical result stems from the fact that the green function ( [ green ] ) , and the field strength derived from it , diverge as one approaches the light cone from inside . to extract physically sensible results one must smear the source so that the field is regularized on the light cone , as illustrated in fig . 2 , and then extract conclusions which are insensitive to the details of the regularization .    [ t ]",
    "plane at @xmath73 , is shown .",
    "the magnetic event is at the origin .",
    "the original retarded green function @xmath74 is nonvanishing inside its future light cone only , but diverges on it .",
    "after regularization , which may be thought of as the smearing of the magnetic event , the field becomes finite on the light cone , but has a rapidly decaying tail outside of it .",
    "one recovers the original green function when the cutoff width @xmath75 approaches @xmath76 . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the need for the regularization stems from the step - functions in the green function ( [ green ] ) .",
    "it is distinctly brought into evidence if one attempts to apply the gauss law for a spacetime region which contains the magnetic event , and whose boundary is formed by two spacelike disks and a timelike cylinder that joins them .",
    "the first spacelike disk is taken to be on the future of the event and it extends slightly outside of its light cone , similarly for the second disk , but to the past of the event . if one takes for @xmath77 in ( [ strengthphi ] ) the one derived from the green function ( [ green ] ) , one finds that its flux across the upper disk diverges whereas the contribution of the lower disk and of the cylinder vanish .",
    "thus , the total flux over the closed surface enclosing the event diverges .",
    "however , on account of eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) the gauss formula yields that the flux should be equal to the magnetic charge @xmath3 . the regularization resolves the problem by smoothing out the green function , so that the gauss formula can be properly applied . in the limit @xmath78 for the regulator ,",
    "the flux across the upper disk becomes @xmath3 , rather than infinity , while the contribution of the cylinder vanishes ( the contribution of the lower disk vanishes already before the limit ) .",
    "thus we will assume that the regularization has been implemented , that the particle has crossed the light cone , and will start the integration assuming that @xmath79 is different from zero , but very small .",
    "this is because , due to the regularization , the particle starts experiencing a force a short time before hitting the light cone , and therefore when @xmath69 it has already turned a little bit .     as a function of @xmath80 for the cases @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in both cases @xmath83 approaches",

    "@xmath94 is a constant .",
    "this implies that for @xmath95 , the trajectory of the particle is a straight line , with @xmath96    moreover , taking in account eq .",
    "( [ asy ] ) it is possible to find the velocity of the particle for large times . the asymptotic expression for the velocity",
    "is given by @xmath97      we now exhibit through a sequence of figures the dependence of the solution of the equation of motion on the spacetime impact parameter @xmath4 , or rather its dimensionless inverse @xmath98 .",
    "special attention is paid to the spacetime scattering angle @xmath94 .",
    "the qualitative behavior is independent of the regularization length @xmath75 .",
    "after crossing the light cone the particle starts spiraling up in time and it settles for large times into uniform motion according to the discussion of the previous subsection . the angle @xmath94 is an increasing function of the impact parameter .",
    "the precise form of the function is cutoff dependent but its asymptotic value for @xmath99 is cutoff independent and equal to @xmath100 .",
    "figures 3 and 4 are drawn for a fixed value of the cutoff @xmath101 .",
    "figure 3 exhibits the time dependence of the polar angle @xmath9 for a small value of @xmath102 and for a large one .",
    "figure 4 exhibits the time dependence of the velocity and its components for @xmath81 .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the dependence of the scattering angle @xmath94 on the inverse impact parameter @xmath102 , for different values of the cutoff , and it shows that , for small @xmath102 , @xmath103 , independently of the cutoff .",
    "the motion in the frame in which the electric charge is initially at rest is as follows : as the particle crosses the light cone it starts rotating and slowing down .",
    "the rotation is counterclockwise for @xmath50 and clockwise for @xmath104 [ recall eq .",
    "( [ py ] ) ] .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that under space reflection @xmath102 is a pseudoscalar because the product @xmath105 of the electric and magnetic charges is a pseudoscalar .",
    "the limit @xmath106 corresponds to a large impact parameter and it is of particular interest because one would expect that then the details of the magnetic source , idealized here to be a point , should be irrelevant . as seen in fig 1 , when @xmath107 , the inscribed ellipsoid becomes very narrow and parallel to the @xmath108 axis .",
    "hence , after a time of the order of the impact parameter , the particle makes sharply a quarter of a turn and comes to rest at the same spatial position at which the event happened in the past .",
    "thus the net effect of the scattering is to change the state of the particle from being at rest @xmath109 , @xmath72 at @xmath69 , to being again at rest @xmath11 , @xmath72 for @xmath110 .",
    "this jump is the main signature of the presence of the magnetic event as felt by an electric charge .    as was anticipated in sec .",
