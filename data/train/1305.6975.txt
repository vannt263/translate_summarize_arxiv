    "grouping behaviour is a widespread phenomenon in animal ecology and is thought to be an emerging property of the self - organisation of individual organisms  @xcite .",
    "while living in groups , social animals benefit from several advantages among which is a more efficient capacity in problem solving  @xcite . of particular interest",
    "is the ability of the group to make collective decisions also when it is composed of individuals with contrasting preferences and information  @xcite .",
    "how groups reach a consensus decision has recently received much attention  @xcite and several mechanisms to pool information in the group have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "often no obvious reason can be adduced to explain the social behaviour of certain species except the fact that those groups are more efficient than single individuals in retrieving information from the environment  @xcite . for groups on the move , such as fish schooling , bird flocking or mammal herding ,",
    "it has been shown that information transfer and social interactions are important factors of group cohesion and can promote the ability of making consensus decisions  @xcite .",
    "an example of such a collective decision making problem is the structure of migration routes in some fish species .",
    "migration between widely separated but geographically stable locations of spawning and feeding sites raises several questions about how these animals manage to learn and _ remember _ the migration route between feeding and spawning sites .",
    "where is the information on the path stored ? how is it retrieved , shared and elaborated by a migrating group ?",
    "are these tasks performed significantly better by the group with respect to the individuals ?",
    "shedding light on the functioning of these mechanisms is a fundamental issue in ecology but may also be relevant to fields such as sociology and economy where it is common to deal with large systems of competitive agents that share information  @xcite .",
    "we hypothesize that _ collective memory _ might play an important role in the migration process of fish populations  @xcite and model its effects on schooling behaviour and migration efficiency .",
    "we tackle these questions by assuming that individuals have different amounts of information about migration routes and that only a fraction of them possesses some information , whereas the rest only exhibit a social behaviour .",
    "those assumptions are consistent with numerical simulations of the evolution of leader and social traits in migratory populations  @xcite but are introduced in our model in a different way .",
    "in fact previous approaches mainly fall in a class of agent based models with spatial interaction  @xcite where `` social '' individuals tend to align and to follow the individuals that are nearby , in a finite spatial range .",
    "this reproduces a realistic dynamics , but it gives little insight on the mechanisms by which the collective behaviour emerges from individual interactions .",
    "indeed due to their complexity , spatial dynamics models can only be studied with extensive numerical simulations .    here , instead , we take    a stochastic adaptive network approach .",
    "network approaches have already been successfully applied to address collective behaviour in animal groups  @xcite : adaptive network models provide , in fact , a simpler mathematical structure which can be analysed more easily than real space models ( i.e. without relying on simulations ) . in all these models , as in ours , spatial dynamics is implicitly taken into account through link creation and destruction processes : changes in the neighbourhood of the individuals due to spatial dynamics are reproduced by link dynamics between nodes ( see figure  [ fig : net_up_proc ] )",
    ".    capitalizing on previous models  @xcite , we build a model introducing the key ingredient of memory for preferred route directions in a fraction of the individuals ( the informed ones ) .",
    "this is introduced as an _ a priori _ bias for a particular route in the choice behaviour of the informed individuals , that is based on their experience in that particular habitat : their _ memory_. therefore , the collective choice of the route direction , is a function of individual and social processes .",
    "we are able to find an exact solution for the model that provides a clear picture of how information is elaborated , stored and shared in the group and allows us to describe an observed switch of migratory path in fish populations as a result of a loss of group level information .",
    "is the link creation rate and @xmath0 the link destruction rate . ]",
    "most studies about swarming phenomena in animal groups have relied on real space dynamical models  @xcite . here",
    ", we address the issue of group formation using a network dynamical model  @xcite .",
    "neighbouring nodes in the graph correspond to neighbouring individuals in space ( figure  [ fig : net_up_proc ] ) .",
    "let us consider a group with @xmath1 individuals . in our network model each individual is represented by a node ( thus @xmath1 is the total number of nodes ) and each node @xmath2 has an internal dynamical variable @xmath3 that can take integer values ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "although the mathematical solution does not depend on the specific interpretation of the variable @xmath3 , in the context of migrating groups , @xmath3 might be considered as the direction taken by a single individual to reach the destination site .",
    "links between nodes represent interactions among individuals by which they influence each other in their choice of the destination .",
    "while space is not explicitly resolved we assume that neighbouring nodes in the graph correspond to neighbouring individuals in space ( figure  [ fig : net_up_proc ] ) . yet",
    "nearby individuals need not necessarily influence each other ( see below ) .",
    "more precisely , a state of the system is defined by the adjacency matrix of the system @xmath6 and by the set of the internal dynamical states variables @xmath3 . in our model , links are _ mutual _ and , thus , the adjacency matrix is a symmetric matrix ( i.e. for all @xmath7 we have that @xmath8 ) such that @xmath9 if there is a link between the nodes @xmath2 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "the evolution of the system is governed by stochastic dynamics in which both the neighbourhood and the values of the internal dynamical state may vary , according to stochastic poissonian processes .",
    "these are discussed in the following ( we refer the reader to the supplementary material for a detailed mathematical definition ) .",
    "the network evolves by creation and destruction of links , that mimic the spatial interaction between individuals .",
    "link creation is quantified by the rate @xmath12 at which individuals form new links with other individuals , this rate encodes both evolutionarily selected traits for pro - social behaviour and environmental factors , notably the average distance between individuals . in our model",
    "we assume that the interactions between individuals heading towards different directions decay much faster than interactions between close individuals heading towards the same direction .",
    "this is in agreement with real space dynamical model and is achieved in the network by assuming that link creation can occur only when individuals have the same internal state @xmath13 .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that if @xmath14 the link between nodes decays immediately .",
    "finally , individuals linked and moving in the same direction can also move further apart from each other , which is formally encoded by assuming that links between nodes decay with a constant rate @xmath0 .",
    "these two processes provide a _",
    "mean field _",
    "description of the real space dynamics .",
    "indeed link creation and decay depend on the geometry of the neighbourhood in spatially explicit models , which is averaged out within the mean field description .",
    "mean field approximations such as this one work very well to capture the qualitative behaviour of complex systems . to set an analogy , in a gas , one does not need to trace the trajectory of each molecule .",
    "it is enough to provide a `` collision integral '' , that loosely speaking gives the probability that a particle moving in a certain direction will interact with a particle moving in a different direction .",
    "here we are taking the same approach .",
    "the change of the internal state is a poissonian process that occurs with rate @xmath15 for each individual .",
    "the choice of the destination @xmath3 is influenced by two factors : _",
    "i ) _ pro - social behaviour , by which an individual keeps the same destination of their neighbours and _ ii ) _ memory , by which an isolated individual preferentially heads toward a destination @xmath16 that is encoded in its memory .",
    "more precisely , when an individual updates its internal state , _",
    "i ) _ if it is linked to other individuals(s ) , it will update its internal state conforming to the state of the majority in its neighbourhood ; i.e. , the new state @xmath17 is : @xmath18 in this formula @xmath19 is kronecker delta function : i.e. if @xmath20 , @xmath21 , otherwise @xmath22 . again",
    "this rule is necessary within our mean field description of spatial interaction because if an individual were to chose a direction which is different from that of the ( majority of the ) group it is in , it would quickly move far apart and its links would decay .    on the other hand , _ ii ) _ if an individual is isolated ( not linked ) , its choice of the internal state is influenced by its preference for a destination that is encoded in their memory .",
    "more precisely , we assume that each individual has a preferred value of the internal variable , let us call it @xmath16 . in the case of an internal state update event , an unlinked individual will pick up a state according to the following probability distribution : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a parameter that measures the intensity of the preference .",
    "this encodes , besides information processing and storage capabilities , also environmental factors related to the properties of a given feeding site , such as quantity of prey , water temperature , water quality etc .    the fraction of individuals with a preferred destination @xmath25 is @xmath26 but we also contemplate a fraction @xmath27 of `` uninformed '' individuals , that have no _ a priori _ preference for any memorized destination .",
    "we use the convention that uninformed individuals have @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , uninformed individuals update their direction at random , which is described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob_update ] ) with @xmath30 .",
    "previous network approaches used a voter model update rule instead of a majority rule  @xcite ; this choice makes no qualitative difference in the stationary case , since our main results are based on a state space decomposition ( see supplementary materials ) that remains valid as long as the update rule promotes local uniformity .",
    "however , we expect detectable differences in the transient behaviour of these systems .",
    "biologically , a majority rule captures the non - linearity of group behaviour .    as in spatially explicit models , in our description individuals",
    "compromise about directional choices .",
    "the majority rule does not prohibit that an individual @xmath2 heading towards a given destination may change its route upon the encounter of another individual @xmath10 . while this is not an elementary event described by the processes above",
    ", it can clearly occur as a composite event that entails the decay of all the links of @xmath2 , an update of its choice and the formation of a link with @xmath10 .",
    "the probability of this event is non - zero and it decreases with the number of individuals @xmath2 is interacting with , as one expects .",
    "in some cases individuals in groups need to compromise between information gathering from the environment and social cohesion of the group  @xcite and thus some previous modelling approaches have assumed a trade - off between information capabilities and pro - social behaviour , in that informed individuals have a reduced tendency to follow their peers .",
    "the present modelling framework may be extended to encompass this situation also by making , for example @xmath12 take different values for informed and uninformed individuals .",
    "this generalization of the model leads to the same conclusions as those discussed below but it comes at the cost of more complex mathematics . in addition , there is no conclusive evidence , as far as we are aware of , that such trade - off really exist in populations of fishes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we have however checked that adding these trade - offs to the model is inconsequential as far as the main results of the model discussed here is concerned , that is why we discuss these aspects in the supplementary materials .",
    "given the above transition rates , we can write down the master equation ( see the supplementary material ) and derive the invariant distribution which describes the stationary state .",
    "one key observation in this is that , since only links between nodes with the same internal state can be established , the process will converge to states where all links @xmath31 are between nodes with @xmath13 .",
    "any state with links @xmath31 connecting nodes with @xmath14 is transient , i.e. is not going to occur in the long run .",
    "this allows us to partition the states of the system into a transient class and a closed ergodic class .",
    "this ensures that the invariant distribution is _ unique_. it can be shown ( see supplementary materials for the details ) that the process satisfies detailed balance and the probability to observe state with a given network @xmath32 and profile of choices @xmath33 in the stationary state , is given by :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the normalization constant .",
    "in particular , when , for some @xmath2 and @xmath10 we have that @xmath14 and @xmath9 , the invariant distribution is zero .",
    "we are also assuming the convention that @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the number of individuals that are in state @xmath38 but would like to be in state @xmath25 and let @xmath39 .    if , in eq .  , we call @xmath40 the non - dimensional parameter that accounts for the effective creation of links in the network , thus measuring the _ sociality _ of the group , then with standard mathematical manipulations ( see supplementary materials ) we can easily write the stationary state distribution in terms of the densities @xmath41 as follow : @xmath42}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath35 is the normalization constant . in the large population limit ( @xmath44 )",
    "this distribution peaks exponentially in @xmath1 around the minima of @xmath45 .",
    "the stationary points of @xmath46 satisfies the following system of equations : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the total density of individuals whose internal state is @xmath38 ( see supplementary materials for detailed calculation ) .",
    "therefore with a large number of individuals and in the stationary state of the system we are able to use eq .",
    "to analytically describe the fraction of individuals with _ a priori _ preference @xmath25 that end up heading towards destination @xmath38 .",
    "this set of non - linear equations has many solutions in principle .",
    "those corresponding to stationary states can be fully characterized in terms of the average degree of the network @xmath49 ( i.e. the average number of neighbours of individuals ) that is a proxy for the school density .",
    "it can be shown that one measure of the network degree is @xmath50 where the quantity : @xmath51 is a direct measure of the school efficiency and it takes values between @xmath52 , when all individuals belong to a group that migrates towards the same destination ; and @xmath53 when individuals distribute equally between different destinations . hence the solution with high coordination ( @xmath54 ) also corresponds to high network densities @xmath55 .    among all the solutions of eq .",
    ", we shall focus on those corresponding to the global minimum of @xmath46 that determine the behaviour of the system , since they correspond to the values around which the stationary distribution shall peak .",
    "we shall analyse two cases 1 ) the case of a population without informed individuals , @xmath56 , and 2 ) the case where a fraction @xmath57 of the individuals have a preferred migratory destination , whereas the rest is not informed .",
    "as function of the social parameter @xmath58 in ( a ) non informed group @xmath59 and ( b ) informed group @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to all the stable solutions of  , the shadowed areas identify the coexistence region whereas the solid lines correspond to the equilibrium solution . ]",
    "when no information is available in the group , the system reduces to an adaptive network model in which group coordination only depends on the rates at which links are created or destroyed  @xcite .    below a certain threshold",
    "@xmath62 only one local minimum exists which corresponds to a symmetric solution @xmath53 ( figure  [ fig : switch_n0n1 ]  a ) ; there the network is sparse,@xmath63 , and the group does not migrate . at @xmath62 , a new bundle of @xmath5 local minima appears at which @xmath64 . there",
    "the network is dense , @xmath65 , and a fraction of the individuals comparable with @xmath1 ( called in graph theory _ giant component _ )",
    "is connected with one another and coordinated on the same destination choice .",
    "the analysis also produces the full probability distribution of different states that allows ranking the solutions in terms of their probability ( see supplementary materials ) . between @xmath62 and @xmath66 both solutions",
    "coexist and individuals can migrate in a coordinated manner or not .",
    "above @xmath66 the only local minima are for @xmath64 while the sparse solution @xmath53 becomes unstable .",
    "there is an intermediate point @xmath67 below which the sparse solution is the most likely outcome whereas , above it , the high density solution will prevail .",
    "possible directions .",
    "the grey area corresponds to a preference parameter @xmath68 ( no preferences ) and the dashed line is the critical line .",
    "the blue area corresponds to @xmath61 and the thick blue line represents the corresponding critical line .",
    "the red area corresponds to @xmath69 and the thick red line represents the corresponding critical line as well . ]      in order to analyse the role of information in the model , we study the simplest possible case , with @xmath5 destinations , a density of informed individual @xmath57 and a preference @xmath70 about a single destination .    the equation again can be solved numerically to obtain prediction on schooling behaviour .",
    "information has two main effects on the system ( figure  [ fig : switch_n0n1 ]  b ) .",
    "first , it breaks the symmetry between the @xmath5 high density solutions found in the @xmath71 case , by selecting the solution with the preferred destination @xmath72 as the most likely .",
    "the @xmath73 solutions corresponding to migration toward other destinations remain stable , but are much less likely to be selected by the population .",
    "secondly , the coexistence region between high and low density solutions @xmath74 $ ] is reduced in the case of informed migration ( figure  [ fig : switch_n0n1 ] ) .",
    "in fact this region becomes smaller as the number of informed individuals increases ( figure  [ fig : phasediagram ] ) .",
    "eventually , there exists a critical value of @xmath75 at which the region collapses into a point .",
    "this change in the behaviour of the system is equivalent to a second order phase transition in physics . for values of @xmath75 greater than this critical point",
    "the system has a smooth transition between low and high density states , as @xmath58 increases , and a single solution is found .",
    "moreover the coexistence region and the critical value change with @xmath70 .",
    "the thick line in figure  [ fig : phasediagram ] marks the point , in the coexistence region , where the two solutions are equally probable ; on the right ( left ) of this line we expect to see the high ( low ) density solution .     as function of the fraction of informed individuals @xmath75 and strength of the preference @xmath70 when the social parameter @xmath58 is ( a ) in a non critical region @xmath76 and ( b ) in a critical region @xmath77 the white line in panel ( b ) is a schematic illustration of the hysteresis mechanism for a bluefin tuna population starting with high @xmath75 and @xmath70 , then decreasing @xmath75 and @xmath70 ( overfishing of both preys and predators ) and subsequently increasing @xmath70 ( increase of population of preys ) . ]",
    "the behaviour of the solution as the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath78 vary , at fixed @xmath58 , is depicted in figure  [ fig : mesh_znc_zc ] . for low values of @xmath58 ( figure  [ fig : mesh_znc_zc]a ) we observe a smooth crossover from low to high density solutions as @xmath70 and/or @xmath79 increase",
    "whereas when @xmath58 is larger the system exhibits a sharp transition between the two solutions ( figure [ fig : mesh_znc_zc]b ) .",
    "the presence of a sharp transition with coexistence in a broad range of parameters is a robust feature of this model .    for more complicated settings using competing groups with different preferred migratory destinations",
    ", it can be shown that , for large @xmath58 the population coordinates towards the migratory destination that provides the largest product @xmath80 ( see supplementary materials ) .",
    "this quantity can be interpreted as the strength of the group s collective memory toward a given migration site , @xmath25 .",
    "this provides us with a vivid picture of how we expect the collective behaviour of the population to change when the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath70 and @xmath81 change .",
    "adapting this picture to the observed behaviour of populations provides hints on the likely underlying causal effects . in brief ,",
    "when @xmath58 is large , i.e. for individuals with a marked pro - social behaviour , we expect abrupt transitions when either the density @xmath26 of individuals with a given preference , or the intensity @xmath82 of that preference varies in such a way as to cross the boundaries in the phase diagram ( figure  [ fig : phasediagram ] ) .    when both the density of informed individuals and the intensity of preference @xmath82 decrease , abrupt transition from efficient group formation to collapse of migration efficiency is visible .",
    "we note that this hysteresis cycle is consistent with observed stock collapses of migratory fish populations  @xcite . when the migratory population is described using a social parameter @xmath58 close to the critical point , then the interplay between the memory for a given destination , @xmath70 , and the fraction of the individuals informed , @xmath75 about this destination can produce an abrupt transition in the migration of the species .",
    "in the case of a school migrating in direction @xmath4 , a decrease of the value of @xmath70 and @xmath75 over years due , for example , to overfishing of both individuals and prey in the migration site , can force the system to cross the critical line reaching eventually low values of both @xmath70 and @xmath75 .",
    "when in this condition , an increase in the value of @xmath70 might occur due for example to better habitat conditions or food availability , for those few vagrant fish that might still be present in the area .",
    "however this increase alone can not bring the system back to the original state because the system may not cross again the critical line .",
    "thus the group may not migrate in direction @xmath4 even though previous habitat conditions are re - established .",
    "we show that abrupt changes in migratory patterns of animal groups can be caused by removal of knowledgeable individuals from the group or by decreasing preference of the individuals towards a particular migratory destination.we demonstrate this with a robust analytical approach that allows to clearly identify the factors regulating group formation processes .",
    "our results are consistent with previous models suggesting that a small number of informed individual can lead to large group migrations  @xcite .",
    "additionally we demonstrate that diminishing individual preference for a given migration site can preclude group formation and break the migration process .",
    "the migration process can be described as an emergent property of the population undertaking a group formation game : when the spatial density of fish is locally low , each individual moves independently , and the system is in a sparse network configuration with a value of @xmath58 below the lower edge of the coexistence region . in this state",
    "uninformed individuals can not migrate whereas informed individuals can undertake a _ solitary _ migration towards their preferred destination . owing to external stimuli ( water temperature , local currents , topography , etc . )",
    "the density may increase and so does the value of @xmath58 , driving the system toward the coexistence region . in this region even though the local density of fish is high , a sparse network configuration with fish moving independently is still stable but an alternative and stable dense network configuration also appears . when the system reaches the upper edge of this region , further increasing the density , the sparse network state becomes unstable while the dense network state prevails and the school starts a migration toward the preferred destination . on the other hand an _ hysteretic _",
    "cycle is present in this system and when the local density of fish decreases in the school , @xmath58 , decreases and the system is driven back to the coexistence region .",
    "a similar effect can be reproduced in the system by lowering the preference factor , @xmath70 .",
    "the schooling configuration remains stable until the system reaches the lower edge of the coexistence region : at this point , fish stop schooling and the system switches back into the sparse configuration ( solitary fish ) .",
    "the group formation game described above can be repeated each year naturally driving changes in the preference term @xmath70 , hence in the memory of migratory fish .",
    "likewise changes in this or in the other terms of the model may occur when the migratory population is affected by external stimuli , e.g. , overfishing , habitat degradation , demographic fluctuations . because of the hysteretic cycle , such variations may then result in _ abrupt _ changes in the migratory patterns .      from the asymptotic analysis ( supplementary materials )",
    "we demonstrate that , for large value of @xmath58 , the group shall migrate toward the direction @xmath25 for which the product @xmath80 is maximal , whereas in the limit of small @xmath58 , the sparse configuration is the only stable one .",
    "this suggest that our results might be extended to groups with conflicting preferences .",
    "it is relevant to note that in our model _ all individuals _ have a social component .",
    "for example in groups with conflicting preferences our model suggests that , for some range of the parameters , an informed individual can follow the group and migrate toward a site different from its preferred destination .",
    "this approach makes our definition of leaders not only dependent on the amount of information stored but also on the social context in which they live .",
    "therefore , the interaction between personal information and social effects is explicitly resolved in our model and  we note  it has been suggested to operate in living groups  @xcite .      breakdown of social traditions , due to selected fishing on older informed individuals , has been hypothesized to have contributed to stock collapses in several large commercially important fish populations  @xcite .",
    "our sketch of the migration game suggests that social dynamics may lead to such collapses and that the integrity of migration pathways and spatial distributions of migratory predators might be particularly vulnerable to perturbations such as fishing or habitat degradation .",
    "fishing out informed individuals and their prey can exacerbate the loss of collective memory up to the point where a migratory pathway is suddenly interrupted .",
    "we can assume that each year young individuals join the group : among them a fraction is able to gather information and remember a migratory route whereas the rest has a purely social behaviour .",
    "the `` information - gathering - able '' individuals behave as uninformed individuals ( @xmath68 ) but _ learn _ a new migratory route during the first migration(s ) .",
    "if the group does not succeed in starting migration , or migrates toward a different location , the young `` information - gathering - able '' individuals will not learn the traditional migration route of the group and the social traditions of the group will not be transmitted to the new generations .",
    "the loss of collective memory in the group will then force the system to cross the critical line and the migration toward the destination site will stop .",
    "an example of a prey - predator collapse and subsequent abrupt disappearance of migratory route is provided by atlantic bluefin tuna ( _ thunnus thynnus _",
    "linnaeus , 1758 ) and its main prey , herring ( _ clupea harengus _",
    "linnaeus , 1758 ) in the norwegian and the north seas . during",
    "the 1950s-1970s both species were heavily exploited in these regions resulting in the disappearances of both species  @xcite . since then , the herring populations in both regions have recovered to moderate - high levels  @xcite , but bluefin tuna have been extremely rare during the 1980s-2000s and apparently had not migrated to these areas in large numbers since the disappearance several decades ago  @xcite .",
    "these hysteretic dynamics are consistent with a fishing - induced removal of predators having preference for migration to these regions and a fishing induced decline in habitat quality which then leads to the collapse of group formation and a sudden change in migratory path ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : mesh_znc_zc ] ) .",
    "we have presented a model that offers and elucidates a plausible mechanism for migration dynamics . by extending and generalizing previous approaches",
    ", our model shows that group formation dynamics have a critical dependence on both sociality , number of informed individuals and strength of the preference in informed individuals .",
    "for example , partial removal of knowledgeable individuals may be sufficient to interrupt the transmission of social traditions in groups of animals .",
    "such critical dependence is consistent with abrupt transitions that are commonly observed in migration patterns of social animals such as atlantic bluefin tuna    as well as other fish populations  @xcite .",
    "our findings offer deep insight into migration dynamics and suggest interesting directions both for data analysis ( e.g. new interpretations of spatial temporal dynamics of migratory populations ) and for further theoretical development ( e.g. accounting for conflicting preferences , continuous directions , different segregation policies , topological interaction ) .",
    "contrary to previous agent based approaches @xcite , our model has the advantage of being analytically soluble , and thus it provides a powerful theoretical bench test for hypotheses on collective animal behaviour .",

    "in these supplementary materials we provide the details of the technical calculation that are presented in the main paper and provide additional comments and details .    in the first section we detail the definition of the model . in the following section we comment on the interpretation of the parameters in terms of fish migratory behaviour .",
    "the third section contains a detailed derivation of the stationary state distribution ( the invariant measure ) , equations  ( 6 ) of the paper . from this",
    "we derive the population distribution eq .",
    "this is then analysed in the limit of large populations ( the thermodynamic limit ) leading to the expression of the free energy  ( 9 ) of main paper .",
    "finally we provide details on the calculation of the equilibrium solution  ( 10 ) of main paper , and of other results cited in the main paper .        for any finite @xmath1 and @xmath5 ,",
    "a _ state _ of the system is defined by the network of interaction between individuals and by the values of the internal variables of the individuals .",
    "the processes described in the main text define a stochastic dynamics on this state space .",
    "for example , when a link is created between two individuals @xmath2 and @xmath10 the system will make a _ transition _ between a state in which the network of interaction has no link between @xmath2 and @xmath10 and a state in which the link between @xmath2 and @xmath10 is added .",
    "we use the letter @xmath83 to generically refer to a state , i.e. @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the @xmath86 adjacency matrix of the system ( i.e. @xmath87 ) , and @xmath88 is a vector whose @xmath2-th component is the values of the internal variable of @xmath2-th node",
    ". we also use @xmath89 to refer of all the possible states in which the system can be ( i.e. the state space ) .",
    "@xmath90 represents the state of the system at time @xmath91 which shall be equal to one of the states described above .",
    "mathematically , our system is _ a continuous time markov chain _ and therefore , its evolution over time is described by a master equation for the probabilities : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and the @xmath94 are the transition rates which correspond to the three dynamical processes described in methods section of the main paper . for clarity sake",
    "we describe them again here .",
    "link creation : :    with a rate @xmath12 each node @xmath2 can establish    a link with another @xmath10 node picked up randomly among the    others .",
    "the link is established only if @xmath13    +    this process can connect only two states @xmath83 and    @xmath95 such that    @xmath96 ,    @xmath11 and @xmath97 .",
    "the transition    rate is clearly @xmath98 link destruction : :    each link ha a destruction rate @xmath0 .",
    "+    this process can connect only two states @xmath83 and    @xmath95 such that    @xmath96 ,    @xmath9 and @xmath99 .",
    "the transition    rate is clearly @xmath100 preference update : :    each node can update its internal state at a rate @xmath15 .",
    "+    if the node is linked when an internal state update event occurs , it    will conform to its neighbourhood .",
    "when an internal state update event    occurs for a linked individual @xmath2 , thus , the new internal    state of that individual @xmath17 is chosen using a    _ majority rule _ ,",
    "that is : @xmath101    +    this assumption is coherent with what is usually done in modelling    group motion that is assuming that an individual tend to `` follow ''    its neighbours .    +    instead , when a node is not linked , it undergoes a random transition    to a state @xmath17 ; the probability of picking up one    direction over another encodes the _ a priori _ information the    individual has .",
    "each individual has a direction preference    @xmath16 . if @xmath28 then each    direction has the same probability(@xmath102 ) of being    chosen ( no _ a priori _ information ) ; if    @xmath103 than the @xmath2-th    individual has a higher probability of picking the direction    @xmath16 over the others . in mathematical term , this can    be written as : @xmath104    where @xmath105 measure the strength of the    preference of node @xmath2 for the direction    @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the strength of the preferences    @xmath82 does not vary among the individuals that share    the same direction preference but may be different for individuals    preferring different directions .",
    "the model can be generalized in different ways .",
    "in particular , the creation rate @xmath106 can be taken to depend on whether individuals are informed ( @xmath107 ) or not ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "in general , if the propensity for forming social links among fishes with preferred direction @xmath25 is @xmath106 , then this more general model entails substituting @xmath109 with @xmath110 in .",
    "this reflects the fact that the creation of the link between @xmath2 and @xmath10 may be initiated by either @xmath2 or @xmath10 an hence their rates add .    for the sake of simplicity , we shall focus our discussion to the case @xmath111 for all @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , the derivation proceeds along exactly the same lines and the gist of the main results is the same .",
    "we shall deal with the general case in section [ sec : tradeoff ] .",
    "our theoretical framework is a stylised representation of the migratory behaviour of fish populations .",
    "the three parameters of the model have a clear interpretation in terms of biological traits of the individuals and of the physical conditions of the environment in which they interact .",
    "the value of @xmath12 must have a dependence on the density of individuals ; most of the real space models assume that individuals interact only with `` close '' individuals ( e.g. closer than a certain radius ) which is a reasonable description of the natural behaviour of schooling fishes ; thus if the local density of individuals is too low the probability of being close enough to interact with one another is small and thus the link creation rate must also be small ; on the contrary the higher the density , the higher the number of `` close '' individuals and the higher the creation rate must be . at the same time",
    ", @xmath12 quantifies also the pro - social behavior of individuals which is encoded in the genetic make - up of the species .",
    "a social fish is expected to be able to interact with other individuals of its species more effectively than a fish of a non social species : by the rules of our model , this means that at a given local density of individuals the social species will have a significantly higher link creation rate @xmath12 and lower link destruction rate @xmath0 and thus a higher value of their ratio @xmath113 .",
    "a variation of local density may induce even significant variation of @xmath12 and therefore of @xmath58 .",
    "the range of these variations , however , may be seen as a _ genetically determined quantity_.    the interpretation of the other parameters is easier , the value of @xmath26 is the relative proportion of individuals in the population with preference for destination @xmath25 ; the value of @xmath82 implicitly measures the strength of the preference , which in turn may encode the property of a given feeding site , such as quantity of prey , water temperature , water quality etc .        1 .",
    "the states of the system can be classified into two sets : one @xmath115 that contains all the states in which the network _ does not contain links between different nodes ",
    "i.e. nodes that have different value of their internal variable  _ and @xmath116 containing all the states in @xmath89 that are not in @xmath115 .",
    "in particular the states for which the network has no links are in @xmath115 ; 2 .",
    "transition from any state @xmath117 to any state in @xmath118 are impossible since the rates vanish @xmath119 in words , link between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath10 with different internal variables @xmath14 can not be generated in the course of the dynamics .",
    "if any such link exists at a given time @xmath91 , then _",
    "i ) _ it must be present in the initial conditions and _ ii ) _ it has a finite life time , because any link decays at a rate @xmath0 .",
    "4 .   as a consequence ,",
    "the dynamics sooner or later reaches a state @xmath120 where no link between different nodes exists , and from that time onwards states @xmath121 where at least one link between different nodes exists , will never be reached . in formal terms , this means that states @xmath118 are transient and therefore they occur with zero probability in the stationary state @xmath122 5 .",
    "it is possible to reach any state in @xmath115 starting from any state in @xmath115 .",
    "more precisely , for any two states @xmath123 it is possible to find a sequence of transitions between intermediate states connecting @xmath83 to @xmath95 , with each transition having a positive probability .",
    "one such `` path '' of transitions , for example  is the one where first all the links in the initial state @xmath83 decay , then the internal variables of each node is updated from the one prevailing in state @xmath83 to the one in @xmath95 , and finally all the links in state @xmath95 are sequentially added .",
    "each of the intermediate states @xmath124 along this path is also in @xmath115 and each transition between consecutive states on the path occurs with a strictly positive rate . since the number of states on the path is finite , this means that the probability @xmath125 to find the system in @xmath83 at time @xmath91 given that it was in state @xmath95 at an earlier time @xmath126 is strictly positive .",
    "since the process can reach any state in @xmath115 from any other state in @xmath115 this proves that the dynamics is _ ergodic _ when restricted to @xmath115 .",
    "this implies that the stationary state exists and is unique ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to verify , by direct substitution , that the probability distribution @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the normalization constant ensuring @xmath129 , satisfies the detailed balance condition @xmath130 indeed , for each @xmath131 for which @xmath132 we have either that @xmath133 also or that @xmath134 but @xmath121 , and therefore eq . ( [ eq : detbal ] ) holds because @xmath135 .",
    "when both @xmath136 and @xmath134 , then either @xmath137 and then eq . ( [ eq : detbal ] ) holds because @xmath138 , or @xmath123 .",
    "in the latter case @xmath83 differs from @xmath95 either for the presence of one link or for the value of the internal variable of a single isolated node . in both cases , one can check that eq .",
    "( [ eq : detbal ] ) holds .",
    "this means that if @xmath139 then @xmath140 , i.e. @xmath141 is a stationary distribution of the process . 8 .",
    "since the stationary state is unique we conclude that @xmath142 is the invariant distribution .",
    "the fact that a process satisfies detailed balance is related to the existence of a potential function @xmath143 such that each transition can be interpreted as either `` climbing '' or `` descending '' the landscape of @xmath144 . in order to gain intuition on why the process satisfies detailed",
    "balance one can argue that such a function @xmath144 exists for this process . indeed ,",
    "notice that the process links states which differ by one link ( with the profile @xmath145 of nodes variables constant ) or states with the same graph @xmath85 , which differ only by the attribute @xmath3 of a single isolated node . in the fist case ,",
    "the transition rate is the same , so the process , at fixed @xmath145 , can be described as `` climbing '' or `` descending '' a step of a function @xmath144 that depends only on the number of links added . in the second case , the dynamics of @xmath145 at fixed @xmath85 involve rates that depend only on whether a node is updated so that his attribute @xmath3 equals the preferred value @xmath16 or not .",
    "this can be captured by a potential @xmath144 that takes two different values depending on whether @xmath146 or not .",
    "we note that @xmath141 is the invariant distribution under a broader set of choices of the internal state update rule . indeed",
    "( [ eq : conform ] ) can be replaced by any rule by which the choice of the internal state @xmath147 is limited to the values @xmath148 of the neighbours of node @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if eq .",
    "( [ eq : conform ] ) is replaced by a rule where node @xmath2 takes the value @xmath148 of a randomly chosen neighbour @xmath10 , as in the voter model , the process converges to the same invariant distribution @xmath149 .",
    "this is because once the process reaches a state @xmath120 , the link creation / destruction policy ensures that local uniformity that characterizes states in @xmath115 will be preserved .",
    "we may expect , however , that the choice of the internal state update rule may influence the transient behaviour of the system ( e.g. average time to reach the stationary state , structure of the metastable states).the analysis of those behaviour , albeit very interesting , is beyond the scope of this work .      in order to take the thermodynamic limit we need to obtain an expression",
    "in which the number of nodes @xmath1 is explicit .",
    "that is we need to infer from the invariant measure   an expression for the probability distribution function of the populations involved .",
    "let s consider a partition of the entire population ( i.e. the number of nodes ) @xmath1 into classes .",
    "let @xmath150 be the number of nodes with preferred state @xmath25 that are in the state @xmath38 .",
    "moreover we define a class of uninformed individuals and define @xmath151 as the number of nodes with state @xmath38 that have no preference ( i.e. @xmath108 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath152 the profile of population occupation states .",
    "obviously @xmath153      for sake of simplification we shall use the following notation : @xmath157 which denotes the number of nodes in actual state @xmath38 , @xmath158 which denotes the number of nodes with preferred state @xmath25 , @xmath159 which denote the number of uninformed nodes .",
    "clearly @xmath160 , @xmath161 are known and fixed .    for each configuration of the internal variables ,",
    "the equilibrium dynamics allows @xmath162 different network configurations with non - zero probability .",
    "the weight of all network structures with a given number @xmath163 of links in a given preference class is the same ( since only networks with links between coordinated nodes carry non zero contribution ) .",
    "calculating their contribution to @xmath164 reduces to counting how many different network structure are there with a given number of links @xmath163 in each component @xmath38 .",
    "the answer is trivially @xmath165 the network contribution to @xmath164 is then @xmath166^{m_{a}}=\\prod_{a}\\left[1+\\frac{2   \\eta}{\\lambda(n-1)}\\right]^{\\binom{n_{a}}{2}}\\ ] ]      in order to compute @xmath169 we notice that there are exactly @xmath170 configuration with the same weight and thus we can write @xmath171^{\\frac{n_{a}}{2}(n_a-1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the normalization constant .",
    "next , we expand @xmath179 in a large n limit , using stirling approximation(@xmath180 , @xmath181 for small @xmath182 and normalization : @xmath183 we then obtain : @xmath184-\\log{{\\mathscr{z } } }   \\end{split}\\ ] ]      in the limit of very large @xmath1 the invariant measure concentrates on the global minimum @xmath187 of the function @xmath188 .",
    "any state @xmath189 with a value of @xmath45 that is larger by @xmath190 than the minimum , will have a probability @xmath191 which is exponentially small compared to @xmath187 , i.e. will virtually never occur for large @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce then lagrange multiplier @xmath195 for the first constraints and @xmath196 for the second one and impose first order conditions ( foc ) : @xmath197 -(\\beta_0 - 1 )   ( n^0-\\sum_a n_a^0)\\right\\}=0\\ ] ] obtaining @xmath198 and @xmath199 and thus @xmath200                            plugging everything in equation   we obtain the following system of equations written in term of @xmath223 : @xmath224\\frac{1-\\gamma}{\\gamma - n^0 }   { \\mathrm{e}}^{-\\frac{z}{{\\mathrm{e}}^h-1}\\frac{1-\\gamma}{\\gamma - n^0}\\left[(1-{\\mathrm{e}}^h)n^0+{\\mathrm{e}}^h   \\gamma \\right ] } \\\\   y{\\mathrm{e}}^{-y}=\\frac{z}{{\\mathrm{e}}^h-1 } \\gamma\\frac{1-\\gamma}{\\gamma - n^0 }   { \\mathrm{e}}^{-\\frac{z}{{\\mathrm{e}}^h-1}\\frac{1-\\gamma}{\\gamma - n^0}\\left[(1-{\\mathrm{e}}^h ) n^0+{\\mathrm{e}}^h   \\gamma \\right ] } & \\text{q-1 times } \\end{cases}\\ ] ]        if @xmath226 is negative the equation has only one negative ( thus unphysical ) solution , if c is greater than @xmath227 it has no solution otherwise it admits solution which can be expressed in terms of lambert w functions  @xcite : @xmath228 and @xmath229 where @xmath230 represents the two real branches of lambert w function ( using the notation of  @xcite ) .",
    "it is trivial to check @xmath231 whereas @xmath232 and that for small values of @xmath226 , @xmath233 and thus is to be discarded .    in our case",
    "@xmath226 is a complicate function of @xmath223 but , as above , once @xmath223 ( and @xmath58 ) is fixed we know that x and y can take only two values @xmath234 and @xmath235 as defined above and thus we can label all the solutions using two integers @xmath25 which counts the number of @xmath182 in + state ( which of course is either 0 or 1 ) and @xmath236 which counts the number of y in + state .",

    "the stationary point will be a ( local minimum ) if and only if : @xmath249 in our case the constraint are linear ; therefore the tangent space @xmath116 is a @xmath250 dimensional space and it can be easily seen to be spanned by the orthonormal base : @xmath251 where @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "the projection operator then is given by the matrix @xmath254 any vector @xmath255 of @xmath116 can be expressed by a general vector @xmath256 of @xmath257 as @xmath258 .",

    "it is easy to verify that the leading correction is extremely small , i.e. @xmath269 the detailed calculation of the leading order correction is carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we remark that _",
    "i ) _ given the size of the correction , the asymptotic limit is representative also of the regime where @xmath58 is only moderately large . _",
    "ii ) _ the free energy for @xmath58 large is approximately given by @xmath270 for this expression it is clear that the global minimum for large @xmath58 is the solution with the maximum @xmath271 . in the case",
    "in which two or more direction have the same value of @xmath272 the solution with the bigger value of @xmath273 will prevail .",
    "let us now discuss the generalization of the above results to cases where informed individuals might be _ less social _ then their co - specific uniformed fellows .",
    "several works , for example @xcite , have assumed that there is a trade - off between sociality and the ability of individuals to store , gather or process information .",
    "there is no conclusive evidence that such trade - offs exist , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "evidences are mounting that individual - level information and social processes can be both present in collective decision processes in fish groups  @xcite .",
    "however , since this aspect has been included as an important ingredient in other models , it is important to explore its reelvance in the present context .    our theoretical framework can be extended to account for this aspect in two different ways : either by making informed individuals promote the formation of links at a lower rate or by generalizing the choice behavior to a stochastic probabilistic model . here",
    "we show that the qualitative results discussed in the main paper are kept significantly unchanged in both cases .        under this assumption",
    "it is possible to calculate the exact invariant distribution and to proceed with the same calculations of the simpler case discussed in the main article .",
    "in particular the large @xmath58 and small @xmath58 solutions are the same . here",
    "we report the main results , without repeating lengthy derivations .",
    "we assume that individuals that are informed about direction @xmath25 shall promote link creation with rate @xmath106 whereas uninformed individuals shall promote link creation with rate @xmath274 .",
    "while we keep the dependence on @xmath25 in @xmath12 , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath275 takes the same value , irrespective of the preferred direction @xmath276 , for all informed individuals .            in order to obtain the distribution in term of population we have to distinguish between two different types of links .",
    "let us define @xmath281 denote the number of links between individuals that are in state @xmath38 but would prefer to be in state @xmath25 and individuals that are in state @xmath38 but would prefer to be in state @xmath282.for simplicity we shall extend the notation described above denoting with preference @xmath279 the individuals with no preference .",
    "let @xmath283 denote the number of individuals that are in state @xmath38 but would prefer to be in state @xmath25 .            the numerical solution of these equations can be studied as a function of the parameters . in particular , in the extreme case where @xmath288 for all informed individuals ( @xmath107 ) exhibits the same hysteric behavior of the homogeneous case discussed above .",
    "the limit @xmath289 can also be studied in exactly the same way as above , with the same conclusion , that corrections to the coordinated solutions @xmath290 are exponentially small in @xmath291 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fheterogeta ] ) it is clear that again the dominant solution for @xmath292 large is the one with the largest product @xmath293 , exactly as in the homogeneous case .",
    "this conclusion also extends to the case where @xmath294 for @xmath295 .",
    "a different way to introduce a tradeoff between sociality and preferences is to modify the update rule  , by assuming that individuals weight their preferred choice and the choice taken by neighbors when updating their choices .",
    "one way to do this is to assume that individual @xmath2 , when an internal state update event occurs , will pick up randomly an internal state with a probability proportional to : @xmath296    the parameter@xmath297 measures to what extent individual @xmath2 takes into account the choices of the social group in making his decision .",
    "the effect of this choice is mostly evident by discussing the limiting cases :    1 .",
    "if @xmath298 , individual @xmath2 will make its choices selfishly , without considering the choices of its neighbouring individuals ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath299 , individual @xmath2 will make its choices always conforming to its neighbourhood , if ths is not empty .",
    "only when his neighborhood is empty , his choice will reflect the pieces of information it possesses : this is exactly the case discussed in the main paper .",
    "nodes and parameter @xmath300 , @xmath301 and @xmath302 for different values of @xmath282 ( the value is written in the legend ) for the informed individuals ( the uninformed ones have @xmath303).,title=\"fig:\"][fig : beta ]    as one can see , @xmath297 interpolates between a fully pro - social behaviour and a completely individualistic one ; the tradeoff may be simply introduced assuming that uniformed individuals have @xmath303 whereas informed individuals have lower @xmath297 .",
    "the drawback of this extension of the model is that , as soon as @xmath304 , the system is not analytically solvable and can only be investigated by numerical stochastic simulations .",
    "[ fig : beta ] reports a series of numerical simulations of this extended model .",
    "this shows that introducing a trade - off between sociality and preference does not qualitatively change the behaviour of the system ; the only appreciable difference being the fact that the symmetric solution becomes unstable at lower values of @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , even though quantitative results differ , the qualitative picture described in the article holds true also in this more general model .",

    "<S> when migrating from spawning to feeding areas fish schools need to retain a collective memory of the destination site over thousand of kilometres and changes in group formation or individual preference can produce sudden changes in migration pathways . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a modelling framework , based on stochastic adaptive networks , that can reproduce this collective behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that three factors control group formation and school migration behaviour : the intensity of social interaction , the relative number of informed individuals and the strength of preference that informed individuals have for a particular migration area . </S>",
    "<S> we treat these factors independently and relate the individuals preferences to the experience and memory for certain migration sites . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that removal of knowledgeable individuals or alteration of individual preference can produce rapid changes in group formation and collective behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> for example , intensive fishing targeting the migratory species and also their preferred prey can reduce both terms to a point at which migration to the destination sites is suddenly stopped . </S>",
