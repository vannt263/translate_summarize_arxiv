    "quantum error correction@xcite made quantum computing ( qc ) theoretically possible .",
    "however , high precision required for error correction @xcite combined with the large number of auxiliary qubits necessary to implement it , have so far inhibited any practical realization beyond proof - of - the - principle demonstrations@xcite .    for stabilizer codes , the error syndrome is obtained by measuring the generators of the stabilizer group .",
    "the corresponding quantum measurements can be greatly simplified ( and also done in parallel ) in low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes which are specially designed to have stabilizer generators of small weight . among ldpc codes , the toric ( and related surface ) codes @xcite have the stabilizer generators of smallest weight , @xmath3 , with the support on neighboring sites of a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "these codes have other nice properties which make them suitable for quantum computations with relatively high error threshold .",
    "unfortunately , these code families have very low code rates that scale as inverse square of the code distance .",
    "recently , tillich and zmor proposed a finite - rate generalization of toric codes@xcite .",
    "the construction relates a quantum code to a direct product of hypergraphs corresponding to two classical binary codes .",
    "generally , thus obtained ldpc codes have finite rates and the distances that scale as a square root of the block length . unfortunately , despite finite asymptotic rates , for smaller block length , the rates of the quantum codes which can be obtained from the construction@xcite are small .    in this work ,",
    "we present a construction aimed to improve the rates of both regular toric@xcite and generalized toric codes@xcite . for the toric codes , we introduce the rotated tori specified by two integer - valued periodicity vectors .",
    "such codes include the checkerboard codes @xcite ( @xmath4-rotation ) , and the family @xcite of minimal single - qubit - encoding toric codes with block length @xmath0 and distance @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "for the generalized toric codes@xcite , we suggest an algebraic construction equivalent to the @xmath4 rotation of the regular toric codes . the resulting factor of up to four improvement of the code rate makes such codes competitive even at relatively small block sizes .",
    "we consider binary quantum error correcting codes ( qeccs ) defined on the complex hilbert space @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the complex hilbert space of a single qubit @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "any operator acting on such an @xmath10-qubit state can be represented as a combination of pauli operators which form the pauli group @xmath11 of size @xmath12 with the phase multiplier @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the usual pauli matrices and @xmath18 is the identity matrix .",

    "the commutativity of stabilizer generators corresponds to the following condition on the binary matrices @xmath33 and @xmath35 : @xmath38    a more narrow set of calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) codes @xcite contains codes whose stabilizer generators can be chosen to contain products of only pauli @xmath15 or pauli @xmath17 operators . for these codes",
    "the parity check matrix can be chosen in the form : @xmath39 where the commutativity condition simplifies to @xmath40 .",
    "the dimension of a quantum code is @xmath41 ; for a css code this simplifies to @xmath42 .",

    "then , if we color every other plaquette to form a checkerboard pattern , we can define the operators @xmath60 as products of @xmath15 operators around the colored plaquettes , and the operators @xmath61 as products of @xmath17 operators around the white plaquettes ( see fig .  [",

    "such a cluster contains @xmath77 vertices , and , again , we have @xmath68 as for the standard checkerboard codes .    since the qubits in the positions shifted by @xmath78 are the same , it is easy to see that our code is identical to that on a cluster with periodicity vectors , e.g. , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and , generally , a cluster with periodicity vectors @xmath81 , where the integer - valued matrix @xmath82 has the determinant @xmath83 .    for a periodicity vector @xmath84 with @xmath85 even , the shortest topologically non - trivial qubit chain has @xmath86 operators which leads to the code distance : @xmath87    a family of near - optimal odd - distance checkerboard codes can be introduced by taking @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath2 .",
