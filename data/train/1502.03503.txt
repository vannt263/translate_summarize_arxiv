    "dehn s algorithm for conjugacy classes proceeds as follows .",

    "the result is * freely cyclically reduced*. if the greater half of the relator or its inverse , treated as cyclic words , appears in the cyclic word , replace it by the inverse of the shorter half .",

    "choose an ideal triangulation of @xmath0 with edges @xmath9 .",
    "the ends of all the edges of the triangulation are mapped to the end of @xmath0 .",
    "this gives rise to a cyclic ordering of the ends of the edges in @xmath9 and a cyclic ordering of all the corners of the triangles .",
    "we say an edge of the triangulation is * antipodal * if in the cyclic ordering there are the same number of corners of triangles between the two ends of the edge on either side in the cyclic ordering .",
    "we define * antipodal corners * similarly .",
    "a * simple diagram * on a surface is a disjoint collection of simple closed curves , none of which bounds a disk on the surface .",
    "the inclusion map @xmath10 sends a simple diagram on @xmath0 to a disjoint union of simple closed curves on @xmath6 .",
    "the system of curves on @xmath6 is not necessarily a simple diagram because any simple closed curve on @xmath0 that bounds a punctured disk on @xmath0 bounds a disk on @xmath11 .",

    "there are two kinds of ideal triangles in an ideal triangulation , * embedded ideal triangles * and * folded ideal triangles*. embedded ideal triangles are just that , folded ideal triangles are triangles with two edges identified .",

    "a * band * @xmath68 of an admissible coloring @xmath23 of an ideal triangulation of a once punctured surface @xmath0 is an ordered family of corners of triangles so that they are consecutive going counterclockwise in the cyclic ordering of corners at the end of the surface , and all of the corner numbers of @xmath63 at the @xmath69 are positive .",

    "we can assume that if any components of @xmath12 and @xmath76 are isotopic on @xmath0 then we have pulled them close to one another , so that they cobound an annulus on @xmath0 and that annulus contains no other components of @xmath12 or @xmath76 .",
    "the complexity in this case is the number of components of @xmath12 that have not been paired this way with components of @xmath76 .",
    "our moves always increase the number of paired components .",
    "once we have arrived at two diagrams that are completely paired , the final isotopy is obvious . in the second case when @xmath86 the complexity will be the geometric intersection number of the two diagrams . in this case",
    ", we can find an innermost bigon on @xmath11 that contains @xmath77 .",
    "we will then use this bigon as a guide that will decrease the geometric intersection number of the diagrams being considered without increasing weight .",
    "after finitely many steps we will be in the first case .",
    "we start with the case where @xmath85 .",
    "assume we have built the sequence @xmath87 , @xmath88 with monotonically decreasing weights .",
    "suppose that we have chosen representatives of the isotopy classes of @xmath83 and @xmath76 in @xmath0 so that @xmath89 , and @xmath83 and @xmath76 realize their geometric intersection numbers with each other and with the edges of the triangulation @xmath9 .",

    "this annulus might have nonempty intersection with one of the pairing annuli . in this case",
    "slide the pairing annulus off the punctured annulus .    in figure",
    "[ annul ] we depict a punctured annulus . in the diagram the two horizontal blue curves are the boundary components of the annulus . in general",
    "one boundary component of the annulus will have greater geometric intersection number with @xmath9 than the other .",
    "the more weighty of the two components must be a component of @xmath27 .",
    "the annulus gives a guide for a handleslide to a representative @xmath26 of lower weight , with more components of @xmath26 paired with components of @xmath76 than before .    in figure",
    "[ annul ] the boundary components of the punctured annulus have the same weight with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "the regions to the left and right of the puncture are the same , so the two ends of edges coming diagonally on the right , and the two ends of edges coming diagonally from the left , are ends of edges of the same triangle . since a triangle only has three sides , two of the ends of edges belong to the same edge of the triangle . since @xmath83 and @xmath76 realize their geometric intersection numbers with the edges of triangulation , it must be that the pair of ends of the same edge is either the upper one on the left and the lower one on the right or the upper one on the right and the lower one on the left .",
    "this can only happen if there is an antipodal edge , and the components of @xmath83 and @xmath76 that cobound this annulus are isotopic to simple closed curves that are pushoffs of this edge .",
    "the annulus can still be used as a guide for a handleslide from @xmath83 to @xmath82 that has the same weight , and we have increased the number of paired components .",
    "the punctured annulus could also look like the diagram in figure [ antipodal ] , where there is an edge of the triangulation lying completely inside the annulus .",
    "note that euler characteristic considerations keep more than one edge of the triangulation from being contained completely inside the annulus .",
    "the analysis is the same as for the last punctured annulus , only it is more obvious that for the boundary components of the annulus to have the same weight the triangulation must have an antipodal edge .",
    "we repeat the last step until we have performed a sequence of handleslides that at the very least do not increase weight , arriving at the least weight @xmath28 that has its components completely paired with the components of @xmath76 .",

    "since @xmath12 and @xmath76 are both least weight this implies that in the sequence of handleslides over bigons and punctured tori the weight of the diagrams is constant .",
