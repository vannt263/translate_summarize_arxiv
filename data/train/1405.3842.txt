    "the discovery of brown dwarfs , objects with masses below the hydrogen - burning minimum mass , at solar abundances , of @xmath30.075@xmath4 @xcite , has challenged our understanding of star formation .",
    "numerous theories propose several methods for the formation of substellar objects by incorporating additional physical processes into models of star formation .",
    "these include ; dynamic ejections , turbulent fragmentation , disk fragmentation , or photoerosion of cores by hot stars @xcite .",
    "constraining these scenarios provides a motivation for detailed studies of young brown dwarfs in diverse environments .",
    "the first step for all observational studies of young brown dwarfs is deep survey work in nearby star forming regions , with the goal of identifying and characterising large samples .",
    "these samples can then be used to constrain the mass function , the disk properties , the binary fraction , and other diagnostics for the star formation process .",
    "an excellent target for this purpose is the nearby upper scorpius ( hereafter upsco ) star - forming region @xcite , which hosts a large population of brown dwarfs @xcite , at a presumed age of 5 - 10myr @xcite .",
    "upsco is at a distance of 145@xmath52pc @xcite , while @xcite note that its members are spread in a roughly spherical volume of approximately 20pc radius about this mean value . a recent examination of the composition of upsco claims that it has solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "the region has little extinction @xcite , and measurable proper motion @xcite , which facilitates the identification of very low mass objects .",
    "it also has a disc fraction of only 23% @xcite .",
    "this means that the flux received comes mostly from photospheres with little contamination from discs .",
    "the young stars and brown dwarfs in upsco are a dispersed population and cover 250 square degrees on the sky ; only the advent of deep wide - field surveys has made the study of the entire region possible .    in our previous papers ,",
    "we have identified a list of brown dwarf candidates in upsco based on the galactic cluster survey that was carried out as part of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey @xcite .",
    "our survey covered the southern part of the association and so it is complementary to previous work by other groups @xcite . here",
    "we present spectroscopic follow - up for a large number of these candidates .",
    "our aims are twofold : to verify the nature of the sources and to examine the spectroscopic properties of the substellar objects in this region .",
    "a total of 30 objects from our survey @xcite were chosen for follow - up spectroscopy .",

    "the class ii objects , on the other hand , have quite different spectra from the class iii objects , and each other .",
    "however there are several features common to the class ii spectra : 1 ; the most obvious feature is the higher normalised flux levels at the h and k band peaks relative to the j band , 2 ; the profiles of the class ii spectra in the region on the blue side of the j band share a distinctive rounded shape , generally being deficient in normalised flux in this wavelength range by comparison with the class iii objects , 3 ; features in this part of the class ii spectra also tend to be attenuated . in particular , the tio feature at 0.84@xmath1 m tends to be much weaker among the class ii objects . taken together , the presence of these characteristics in a spectrum appear to be diagnostic of a class ii object .",
    "an examination of the other class ii objects in the sample ( 2 , 4 and 10 ) showed that they exhibit these same characteristics when compared to class iii objects of similar spectral type .",
    "the most likely origin of these spectral features is excess emission from a circumsubstellar disc . in these objects , warm dust from the inner disc",
    "absorbs photospheric light and emits it at longer wavelengths .",
    "this causes the observed excess in the near - infrared bands . as seen in fig . 5 , the excess becomes stronger from the j to the k band . at the blue end of our spectra ,",
    "the attenuation of the photospheric features is similar to the veiling observed in t - tauri stars , a phenomenon which has been attributed , at least in part , to accretion processes @xcite .",
    "the presence of these characteristics raises questions about the reliability of the spectral typing of class ii objects using near - infrared spectra .",
    "if the flux at wavelengths longer than j contains significant contributions from a dusty disc , the shape of the h band or k band peak can not be relied upon to represent the shape of the underlying photospheric spectrum .",
    "5 shows that contributions from the discs of the class ii objects seem to be altering the shape of the spectra in the region of the k band by filling in the h@xmath9o absorption band at 1.75 - 2.05@xmath1 m .",
    "this appears to be the reason that the h@xmath9o - k2 index yielded much earlier spectral types for objects 11 and 12 than the other indices .",
    "moreover , it is also clear from fig .",
    "5 that the spectra of the class ii objects also have significant contributions from their discs in the region of the h band . without a clear understanding of how that part of the spectral profile is affected by contributions from the disc",
    "it is impossible to be confident that the spectral types derived from the h - peak and h@xmath9o indices are any more reliable than the h@xmath9o - k2 index spectral types for these 3 objects .",
    "5 indicates that to obtain a reliable spectral type of a class ii brown dwarf using near - infrared spectroscopy , the overall shape of the spectrum from 0.8 - 2.5@xmath1 m needs to be taken into account . if it resembles that of the class ii objects in fig . 5 any spectral type derived using only a small part of this wavelength range",
    "should be regarded as provisional . for such objects",
    ", the most reliable spectral types might still only be obtained from optical data .",
    "thus , we caution against relying on near - infrared spectra for spectral typing of objects with known excess emission from a disc .",
    "the class iii spectra show a lesser , but still significant diversity between objects of the same spectral type . in the following ,",
    "we illustrate this by comparing spectra of class iii objects with similar spectral types .",
    "6 shows the spectra of class iii objects 1 , 9 , 13 and 19 , all of which are classified between m7.1 and m7.3 using the hpi .",
    "the spectra have similar shapes on the blue side of the h band peak .",
    "however , in the h and k band , object 1 has higher normalised flux levels ( by @xmath16% ) than the other objects and its features are a little shallower at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "the characteristics seen in the spectrum of object 1 are qualitatively similar to the appearance of the class ii spectra ( section 6.1 ) .",
    "the same pattern of diversity can be seen between the spectra of the class iii objects 7 , 14 and 19 and the class ii object 4 in fig .",
    "all have spectral types of m5.9 as determined via the h@xmath9o index .",
    "object 4 exhibits slight traces of the class ii characteristics seen in fig .",
    "it has higher normalised flux levels in the h band , while at the shorter wavelengths it exhibits a deficiency in normalized flux and attenuated features .",
    "the spectrum of object 1 is very similar to that of object 4 in fig .",
    "8 , where they are shown along with the class iii objects 17 and 18 .",
    "all are classified as type m5.6 or m5.7 via the h@xmath9o - k2 index .",
    "the similarity of objects 1 and 4 is such that it appears that the spectrum of object 1 is not completely photospheric in origin but also contains small contributions from a dusty disc .",
    "this tallies with its position in fig 6 . objects 17 and 18 have lower normalised flux levels on the red side of j and display higher levels on the blue side of j , indicating that their spectra are more photospheric in origin .    in summary , the differences between the spectra shown in figs .",
    "6 , 7 and 8 are of a similar pattern to the differences between the class ii and class iii objects shown in fig . 5 , albeit at a lower level . compared with the cases shown in fig . 5",
    ", the observed spectral diversity is small and does not affect the spectral type significantly ( i.e. by more than 1 subtype ) .",
    "the class ii like characteristics are present in 7 of the 18 ( @xmath2% ) class iii objects in the 2@xmath6 sample .",
    "the nature of the anomalous emission observed in some class iii objects remains unclear .",
    "it is conceivable that the spectral diversity in the class iii objects is related to the presence of traces of dust and gas surrounding these objects .",
    "one possibility is that these objects represent an intermediate stage - a class ii.5 as it were - between the objects with bona fide discs and the `` clean and clear '' class iii sources without any evidence for excess emission .",
    "alternately , the diversity among the class iii spectra may be due to reddening . to test this",
    ", we artificially reddened the spectra of objects 13 , 17 , 18 , 19 and 23 , and compared them with those of the other objects .",
    "to redden the spectra , we used the near infrared extinction law : @xmath17 with a value of 1.7 for @xmath18 , as given by @xcite , and took @xmath19 = 0.282@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we then adapted the method used by @xcite , to correct for reddening in spectra obtained with spex , and reddened each spectrum using a range of values for @xmath20 between 1 and 10 . in each case , the least reddened spectra differed from the original spectrum in a manner that closely resembled the pattern of differences shown in figs .",
    "6 , 7 and 8 .",
    "the differences that were observed are typified by the example shown in fig .",
    "reddened spectra of object 19 are plotted alongside its real spectrum and compared to the spectrum of object 1 . both objects ( which also feature in figs .",
    "6 , 7 and 8) are classified as m7.2 using the hpi .",
    "the spectrum of object 1 most closely resembles the spectrum of object 19 that has been reddened using an @xmath21 = 1 .",
    "an @xmath21 = 1 is within the limits of the little extinction that exists in the region of upsco where the objects are located @xcite . on this basis ,",
    "a plausible amount of inter - stellar reddening could account for the diversity among the spectra of the class iii objects .",
    "reddening alone is not a plausible cause of the different shape of the spectra of the class ii objects shown in fig .",
    "5 . objects 5 and 11 have similar spectral types ( m7.8 and m7.9 via the hpi ) , and yet their spectra are very different _ to each other _ , as well as to the spectra of the class iii objects in the same diagram",
    ". no single reddening law could produce a match for both spectra .",
    "a comparison with the reddened spectra of object 23 , ( which has a similar hpi spectral type of m7.8 ) , also shows that none of its reddened spectra are a match for the spectra of objects 5 or 11 .",
    "therefore , while reddening may be present in these cases , it can not be the predominant cause of the diversity among these class ii spectra .",
    "nor , if present , can it be readily distinguished from the overwhelming contributions of the circumsubstellar discs .",
    "all the class ii objects in this survey were shown in @xcite to have excess flux in the mid - infrared .",
    "the objects with the largest mid - infrared excess were also shown to have a corresponding contiguous excess in the near - infrared , as shown in figs . 4 and b1 of @xcite .",
    "all of the class ii objects exhibit these characteristics , although they may be present to a much lesser extent , while they are present in only @xmath2% of the class iii objects , in the 2@xmath6 sample . among the class iii spectra that exhibit these characteristics ,",
    "disentangling the relative contributions of small amounts of excess emission , veiling and reddening involved is not possible .",
    "therefore , although near - infrared spectroscopy may be more sensitive to residual disc emission than mid - infrared photometry , it does not , in these cases , provide the robust certainty required for identifying circumsubstellar discs that is provided by mid - infrared photometry . in each case , whatever the exact cause of these effects , the underlying photospheric spectrum is being obscured and distorted .",
    "+      +      +      +      there is a need for a catalogue of spectral templates of young brown dwarfs that are clean and clear of the effects of veiling , excess emission and reddening , in order to establish benchmarks that can be used to correct for these effects .",
    "the spectra of the 24 objects in the 2@xmath6 sample were examined with the intent of producing a sequence of template spectra of young brown dwarfs that are free of contributions from any source other than their photospheres .",
    "our spectroscopic survey is ideal for producing such a catalogue for two reasons : 1 ) upsco is not significantly affected by extinction , 2 ) the disc fraction in upsco ( 23% ) is low by comparison with other young star forming regions @xcite , which maximises the chances of obtaining spectra that are purely photospheric in origin .    in a first step ,",
    "objects 5 , 11 and 12 - the class ii objects from fig .",
    "5 - were summarily disregarded .",
    "object 4 - the class ii object which features in figs . 7 and 8 - was also disregarded , along with the class ii objects 2 and 10 .",
    "each class iii object had its spectrum compared with others of a similar spectral type from each index , as in figs .",
    "the spectra of objects 1 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 15 , 16 and 22 were found to exhibit excess emission and veiling .",
    "each spectrum was also compared , in the same manner , to every other member of the 2@xmath6 sample .",
    "irrespective of their difference in spectral types . apart from the expected variety among objects of different spectral type , no other pattern of diversity or anomaly , other than that already discussed , was discerned .",
    "the spectra of the remaining class iii objects ( table 3 ) are those that , by comparison , show no evidence of excess emission , veiling or reddening .",
    "we present them as a catalogue of spectra of young brown dwarfs which , to the greatest extent discernible , are clear of contributions from sources other than their photospheres .",
    "the spectral types of the chosen objects , as determined from our near - infrared spectra , range from m5.5 to l1.1 .",
    "table 3 also includes a rough estimate of the effective temperature ( t@xmath22 ) of each object .",
    "the t@xmath22 of each object was estimated using the spectral type - t@xmath22 relationship given in @xcite for objects of spectral types later than m1 .",
    "the different spectral types of each object , derived via the 3 different spectral indices , yielded a range of values of t@xmath22 for each object .",
    "the t@xmath22 listed in table 3 is the median of these values , rounded to the nearest 50k .",
    "the typical uncertainty in each estimated t@xmath22 is 150 - 200k .",
    "the catalogue of these spectra can be accessed at : http://browndwarfs.org/sonyc .",
    "we have carried out a near infrared spectroscopic analysis of 30 objects in the upsco star forming region , 24 of which had been previously identified as brown dwarf candidates based on their photometry and proper motion alone .",
    "the resulting spectra confirm that all 24 are young very low mass objects with spectral types that range from m5.5 to l1.1 .",
    "we have observed a diversity in form among the spectra that can impact on spectral type determination .",
    "class ii objects display excess emission and veiling in their spectra .",
    "the same form of excess emission and veiling is also present in the spectra of 7 out of 18 ( @xmath2% ) class iii objects .",
    "this is evidence that these class iii objects are still accreting from an inner disc of dust and gas which is too faint to be detected via mid - infrared photometry .",
    "we present a catalogue of near infrared spectra for young brown dwarfs that are clear from discernible contributions from anything other than their photospheres . we recommend the use of these objects as spectroscopic templates for identifying young brown dwarfs , and make them available at : http://browndwarfs.org/sonyc .",
