    "since its discovery in 1974 , the @xmath0 meson has provided a useful laboratory for quantitative tests of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and , in particular , of the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of heavy - quarkonium production and decay .",
    "this formalism implies a separation of short - distance coefficients , which can be calculated perturbatively as expansions in the strong - coupling constant @xmath2 , from long - distance matrix elements ( mes ) , which must be extracted from experiment .",
    "the relative importance of the latter can be estimated by means of velocity scaling rules , i.e.  the mes are predicted to scale with a definite power of the heavy - quark ( @xmath3 ) velocity @xmath4 in the limit @xmath5 . in this way ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are organized as double expansions in @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "a crucial feature of this formalism is that it takes into account the complete structure of the @xmath6 fock space , which is spanned by the states @xmath7 with definite spin @xmath8 , orbital angular momentum @xmath9 , total angular momentum @xmath10 , and colour multiplicity @xmath11 . in particular",
    ", this formalism predicts the existence of colour - octet ( co ) processes in nature .",
    "this means that @xmath6 pairs are produced at short distances in co states and subsequently evolve into physical , colour - singlet ( cs ) quarkonia by the nonperturbative emission of soft gluons . in the limit @xmath12 , the traditional cs model ( csm ) @xcite is recovered .",
    "the greatest triumph of this formalism was that it was able to correctly describe @xcite the cross section of inclusive charmonium hadroproduction measured in @xmath13 collisions at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , which had turned out to be more than one order of magnitude in excess of the theoretical prediction based on the csm .    in order to convincingly establish the phenomenological significance of the co processes , it is indispensable to identify them in other kinds of high - energy experiments as well .",
    "studies of charmonium production in @xmath1 photoproduction , @xmath1 and @xmath14 deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , @xmath15 annihilation , @xmath16 collisions , and @xmath17-hadron decays may be found in the literature ; see ref .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein .",
    "furthermore , the polarization of charmonium , which also provides a sensitive probe of co processes , was investigated @xcite .",
    "none of these studies was able to prove or disprove the nrqcd factorization hypothesis .    in this paper , we revisit @xmath0 inclusive production in @xmath1 dis . in order to avoid kinematic overlap with diffractive production , which can not yet be reliably described within purely perturbative qcd",
    ", we require that the @xmath0 meson be produced in association with a hadron jet @xmath18 , i.e.  we consider the process @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the proton remnant . in this way",
    ", the inelasticity variable @xmath21 , which measures the fraction of the virtual - photon ( @xmath22 ) energy transferred to the @xmath0 meson in the proton rest frame , can take values below unity , away from the endpoint @xmath23 , where diffractive production takes place . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath0 meson can acquire finite transverse momentum @xmath24 in the @xmath25 centre - of - mass ( cm ) frame , and the hadronic system @xmath26 consisting of the jet @xmath18 and the proton remnant @xmath20 can acquire finite mass @xmath27 . by the same token , diffractive events can be eliminated from the experimental data sample by applying appropriate acceptance cuts on @xmath21 , @xmath24 , or @xmath27 . another possibility to suppress",
    "the diffractive background at @xmath28 would be to require that the photon virtuality @xmath29 be sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "however , then also the bulk of the nondiffractive signal would be sacrificed .    the leading cs me of the @xmath0 meson is @xmath30\\right\\rangle$ ] , its leading co ones are@xmath31\\right\\rangle$ ] , @xmath32\\right\\rangle$ ] , and @xmath33\\right\\rangle$ ] , with @xmath34 . at lo ,",
    "we are thus led to consider the partonic subprocesses @xmath35+a$ ] , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "here , @xmath38 runs over the light - quark flavours @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . notice that @xmath42 + q(\\overline{q})$ ] is forbidden because the charm - quark line is connected to one gluon , which transfers colour to the @xmath43 pair .",
    "representative feynman diagrams are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fey ] .",
    "the corresponding cross sections are of @xmath44 .",
    "there are several motivations for our study of @xmath19 in dis .",
    "for one thing , the h1 collaboration measured various distributions of this process at desy hera @xcite , which wait to be confronted with appropriate theoretical predictions .",
    "this allows for a particularly clean test of the nrqcd factorization hypothesis , since the large photon virtuality @xmath29 ensures that perturbative qcd is applicable and that the resolved - photon contribution , which suffers from our imperfect knowledge of the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of the photon , is greatly suppressed .",
    "furthermore , at least within the csm , this process provides a good handle on the gluon pdf of the proton , which is less precisely known than the quark ones . in nrqcd , however , the extraction of the gluon pdf is somewhat aggravated by the presence of the co channels with a quark or antiquark in the initial state and by the uncertainties associated with the co mes .",
    "fortunately , detailed inspection reveals that the relative importance of the quark- and antiquark - induced channels is greatly damped in the hera regime .",
    "we return to this point at the end of section  [ sec : three ] .    on the other hand , in the case of @xmath0 inelastic photoproduction , with @xmath45 , nrqcd with co mes tuned @xcite to fit",
    "the tevatron data @xcite predicts @xcite at leading order ( lo ) a distinct rise in cross section as @xmath46 , which is not observed by the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at hera .",
    "this co charmonium anomaly has cast doubts on the validity of the nrqcd factorization hypothesis , which seems so indispensible to interpret the tevatron data in a meaningful way .",
    "although there are several interesting and promising ideas how to reconcile this data with the nrqcd prediction , e.g.  by including dominant higher - order effects @xcite , by introducing nonperturbative shape functions that resum higher - order corrections related to the kinematics of soft - gluon radiation and to the difference between the partonic and hadronic phase spaces @xcite , or by endowing the partons inside the proton with intrinsic transverse momentum ( @xmath47 ) @xcite , it is of great interest to find out if this anomaly persists , at lo and without resorting to shape functions or @xmath47 effects , if @xmath29 is increased to large values .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the cross sections of the partonic subprocesses under consideration here constitute an essential ingredient for the calculation of the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections to the inclusive cross section of the reaction @xmath48 in dis , which , at lo , proceeds through the partonic subprocesses @xmath49 $ ] with @xmath50 .",
    "the cross sections of the latter are of @xmath51 and may be found in eq .",
    "( 3 ) of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in fact , integrating over the phase space of the massless final - state parton @xmath52 , one obtains the real radiative corrections . if @xmath53 and @xmath50 , then they suffer from both infrared ( ir ) singularities and collinear ones associated with the incoming gluon .",
    "the latter are factorized , at some factorization scale @xmath54 , and absorbed into the bare gluon pdf of the proton , so as to render it renormalized .",
    "the ir singularities cancel when the real radiative corrections are combined with the virtual ones .",
    "finally , the ultraviolet ( uv ) radiative corrections contained in the latter are removed by renormalizing the couplings , masses , wave - functions , and non - perturbative mes appearing in the lo cross section of @xmath48 .",
    "finally , the literature contains mutually inconsistent formulas for the cross section of the cs partonic subprocess @xmath55+g$ ] @xcite . on the other hand , there is only one paper specifying analytic results for the cross sections of the co partonic subprocesses enumerated above @xcite , so that an independent check seems to be in order .",
    "we anticipate that we disagree with all published cs and co formulas , except with the one referring to @xmath56+g$ ] @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : two ] , we present , in analytic form , the cross sections of the partonic subprocesses @xmath35+a$ ] enumerated above to lo in nrqcd and explain how to calculate from them the total cross section of @xmath19 in dis and several distributions of phenomenological interest .",

    "however , the quark- and antiquark - induced co subprocesses only yield a minor contribution , less than 5% of the total cross section .",
