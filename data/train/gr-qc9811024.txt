    "for the last decade spacetime solutions of gravitating monopoles has been intensively studied in the literature @xcite . this originated from rather mathematical interest in static monopole solutions . in both cases of global monopoles @xcite and of magnetic monopoles @xcite , static regular solutions are nonexistent if the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field @xmath0 is larger than a critical value @xmath1 , which is of the order of the planck mass , @xmath2 .",
    "the properties of monopoles for @xmath3 had been a puzzle for some time .    in connection with the above issue , it has been claimed by several authors independently that monopoles expand exponentially if @xmath4 @xcite . among them ,",
    "guendelman and rabinowitz @xcite assumed the simplified model of a global monopole under the thin - wall approximation , while linde @xcite and vilenkin @xcite made qualitative arguments on any kinds of topological defects and argued that their core would inflate if the vev of the higgs field is large .",
    "later the full evolution equations for monopoles were numerically solved @xcite , supporting the previous arguments as a whole .",
    "furthermore , those numerical analyses revealed an unexpected result that the critical value , @xmath5 , above which inflation occurs in the core , is larger than @xmath6 , and stable but nonstatic solutions exist for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of global monopoles , we find @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite . global spacetime structure of an inflating monopole has also been discussed in @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the study of monopole inflation to the brans - dicke ( bd ) theory .",
    "if the bd field exists , the inflationary universe may not expand exponentially but expand with a power law even in the presence of an effective cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "for example , in extended inflation @xcite , this slower expansion was expected to solve the graceful exit problem of old inflation @xcite .",
    "we thus expect that the bd field also affects the dynamics and global spacetime structure of inflating monopoles .",
    "we would also like to discuss whether the present model can be a realistic cosmological model or not .",
    "once inflation happens , the spatial gradients of the fields become negligibly small on the scale of the observed universe .",
    "therefore , just as other inflationary models , we have only to care about quantum fluctuations .",
    "this issue resolves itself into the commonplace analysis of density perturbations in the inflationary universe .",
    "here we adopt the result obtained by starobinsky and yokoyama @xcite , who derived the general expression of the density fluctuations in the bd theory , taking account of the isocurvature mode as well as the adiabatic mode .",
    "the rest of the paper is composed of two independent analyses . in the first part (  2 )",
    ", we investigate the dynamics and global spacetime structure of an inflating global monopole . in the second part (  3 )",
    ", we discuss cosmological constraints on this model , which come mainly from density perturbations .",
    "we use the units @xmath10 throughout the paper .",
    "the brans - dicke - higgs system , which we consider here , is described by the action @xmath11,\\ ] ] with @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the bd field and the real triplet higgs field , respectively . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the bd parameter and the higgs self - coupling constant , respectively .",
    "let us begin with a discussion of the fate of an inflating topological defect .",
    "once inflation begins , the core region can be approximated by the flat friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime : @xmath17 which yields the solution of extended inflation @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hubble parameter at the beginning of inflation , and @xmath20 .",
    "hence , the effective planck mass , @xmath21 continues to increase until inflation ends .",
    "this implies that , even if @xmath22 is large enough to start inflation initially , it eventually becomes smaller than the critical value @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we thus speculate that any defect eventually shrinks after inflation .    in order to ascertain the above argument",
    ", we carry out numerical analysis for spherical global monopoles .",
    "the coordinate system we adopt is @xmath24 for the matter fields , we adopt the hedgehog ansatz : @xmath25 for the initial configurations of the higgs fields and the bd field , we assume @xmath26 @xmath27 where an overdot denotes @xmath28 .    although the numerical code developed by one of us @xcite worked well for monopoles in the einstein theory , for the present system which includes the bd field it sometimes does not keep good accuracy for sufficient time .",
    "we therefore improve our numerical method , mainly based on the idea of nakamura _",
    "et al._@xcite   the basic equations and our improved numerical method are presented in appendix .",
    "to illustrate our results , we take @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the evolutions of @xmath31 and @xmath22 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "clearly the above arguments are verified by this numerical result : as @xmath22 gets close to the critical value , the monopole stops expanding and turns to shrink . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the trajectories of the position of @xmath32 for several values of @xmath15 .",
    "the curves indicate that a monopole do not shrink toward the origin but tends to take a stable configuration .",
    "next , we shall examine the metric outside the monopole .",
    "before we consider monopoles in the bd theory , let us review previous work on the outer solution in the einstein theory briefly .",
    "the approximate expression for the metric outside a static monopole was found by barriola and vilenkin ( bv ) @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an integration constant and @xmath35 .",
    "later harari and lousto pointed out that the mass parameter @xmath34 is negative and therefore a global monopole has a repulsive nature @xcite . for large @xmath36 , the metric ( [ bv ] )",
    "can be approximated by @xmath37 and therefore @xmath38 is interpreted as a deficit solid angle .",
    "although the expression ( [ bv2 ] ) looks singular when @xmath39 , cho & vilenkin @xcite showed that it is just an apparent singularity and ( [ bv2 ] ) also applies to the case @xmath40 .    now we would like to discuss the properties of the outer spacetime by comparing it with the bv solution ( [ bv ] ) . as a coordinate - independent variable ,",
    "we adopt the misner - sharp mass @xcite , which is defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the circumferential radius of the spacetime .",
    "note that @xmath43 has a dimension of length , and @xmath44 is a mass in a usual sense .",
    "the bv solution is characterized by @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of @xmath47 . in the case of the einstein theory ( a ) , @xmath47 seems to converge into @xmath48 ( = @xmath49 in this case ) at large @xmath36 , confirming that the metric is well approximated by ( [ bv ] ) .",
    "the result with the bd gravity looks similar , but a different character is that @xmath47 decreases with time even at a far region .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the bv solution in the einstein theory : if we take account of the time - variation of @xmath50 in the bv expression ( [ bv ] ) , a deficit solid angle effectively decreases and ( [ bv ] ) also approximates the solution in the bd theory .",
    "our results obtained so far are rephrased as follows : our numerical integration of the evolution equations verifies as a whole the arguments with considering only the time - variation of @xmath51 .",
    "that is , the metric in the core of a monopole is well approximated by ( [ extinf ] ) , and the metric outside the core by ( [ bv ] ) with changing @xmath50 .",
    "although we have chosen small @xmath15 to illustrate the effect of the bd field clearly , if we take @xmath52 as constrained by observation @xcite , the spatial gradient of @xmath13 is much smaller , justifying more the arguments with neglecting the spatial configuration of @xmath13 .",
    "the result that inflation eventually ends stems merely from the change of the local values of @xmath51 .",
    "we may therefore extend this result to models of other topological defects .",
    "in this section we discuss constraints for this model to be a realistic cosmological model .",
    "as we mentioned in  1 , the main constraint is from density perturbations . in the present model matter fields are composed of the bd field @xmath13 and the higgs field @xmath14 . for the higgs field , we only calculate fluctuations in the radial direction @xmath53 , because fluctuations along the other directions do not contribute to growing modes .    here",
    "we analyze the field equations in the einstein frame by use of a conformal transformation , following previous work @xcite .",
    "a wide class of generalized einstein theories is described by the einstein - hilbert action with scalar fields : @xmath54 ~~ { \\rm with } ~~ \\kappa^2\\equiv8\\pi g,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constants , and @xmath57 is the redefined scalar field .    in the bd theory , on which we concentrate in this section , the original action in the jordan frame ( [ action ] ) is transformed into ( [ action2 ] ) with @xmath58 through the conformal transformation and the redefinition of the scalar field @xmath59 with @xmath60 being a constant . from ( [ contra ] ) , the planck mass in the jordan frame is written as @xmath61 we set @xmath62 at the present time , @xmath63 , identifying a constant @xmath64 with the planck mass at present . because the evolution of the bd field after inflation is negligibly small for @xmath65 , we may identify @xmath13 at the end of inflation , @xmath66 , with @xmath60 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath67 ) . in the following we sometimes use the symbol @xmath51 instead of @xmath57 , and define @xmath68 .",
    "hereafter , we omit a hat , which has denoted quantities in the einstein frame . taking the background as the spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime ( [ frw ] ) , the field equations for the homogeneous parts read @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 the conditions for slow - roll inflation ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , etc . ) are equivalent to @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "for the potential ( [ pote ] ) , the second and the third inequalities in ( [ slow1 ] ) in the range @xmath76 are equivalent to @xmath77 where terms of higher - order of @xmath78 have been neglected in the second inequality .",
    "one of the distinguished features of this model is that there are two scenarios of exiting from an inflationary phase and entering a reheating phase .",
    "this is illustrated by the slow - roll conditions ( [ slow2 ] ) .",
    "when the condition @xmath79 ( a more precise condition is @xmath80 ) breaks down , inflation stops globally . before this time",
    ", many local regions with the present - horizon size enters a reheating phase when the second condition @xmath81 breaks down .",
    "the second scenario is just like that of standard topological inflation or other slow - roll inflationary models . in the first scenario",
    "a microscopic monopole might remain in the observable universe .",
    "unfortunately , however , this possibility turns out to be ruled out because the spectrum of density fluctuation is tilted excessively if @xmath0 is too close to the critical value @xmath82 @xcite and because @xmath83 must be larger than 1 from the cobe normalization as will be seen later in fig .",
    "thus we only consider the second ( standard ) reheating scenario below .",
    "when inequalities ( [ slow2 ] ) are satisfied , the field equations are approximated by @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 which yield solutions @xcite , @xmath87 @xmath88    starobinsky and yokoyama @xcite derived the amplitude of density perturbation on comoving scale @xmath89 in terms of bardeen s variable @xmath90 @xcite as @xmath91,\\ ] ] where all quantities are defined at the time @xmath92 when @xmath93-mode leaves the hubble horizon , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath94 . since the large - angular - scale anisotropy of the microwave background due to the sachs - wolfe effect",
    "is given by @xmath95 , we can constrain the values of @xmath16 and @xmath96 by the cobe - dmr data normalization @xcite , @xmath97 on the relevant scale . to calculate ( [ q ] ) explicitly , we have to relate scales during inflation and present scales .",
    "the number of @xmath98-folds @xmath99 between @xmath100 and @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the energy density when reheating completes , which is not determined without specifying a reheating model .",
    "here we choose @xmath104 typically",
    ". then the corresponding values of @xmath57 and @xmath31 are determined from ( [ con1 ] ) and ( [ con2 ] ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the allowed values of @xmath16 and @xmath96 for @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the concordant values are represented by two curves , which is a distinguished feature for the double - well potential ( [ pote ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , fine - tuning of @xmath107 is needed , just like other models @xcite . the condition of @xmath108 in the present potential was also found in @xcite .",
    "the constraints for @xmath52 are practically no different from those in the einstein gravity .",
    "using the relation @xmath109 and ( [ sloweq1])-([sloweq3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath110 \\nonumber\\\\ \\cong-{3m_{\\rm pl}(\\phi)^2 v_{,\\psi}^{~2}\\over 8\\pi v^2 } + { m_{\\rm pl}(\\phi)^2 v_{,\\psi\\psi}\\over 4\\pi v } -6\\gamma^2.\\ ] ] the spectral indices are plotted in fig . 5 ; the two lines correspond to the two lines of cobe - normalized amplitudes in fig .",
    "as ( [ index ] ) suggests , the deviation from the einstein theory is only @xmath111 for @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , relatively large shift from @xmath112 is caused not by the bd field but by the double well potential ( [ pote ] ) .",
    "besides the amplitude of density perturbation , we have to check other conditions for successful inflation .",
    "first , if we take quantum fluctuations @xmath113 into account , the classical dynamics is meaningless unless @xmath114 we check the value of @xmath115 at @xmath116 which satisfies the cobe normalization , finding that ( [ psiq ] ) is always satisfied .",
    "the second is the condition that classical description of spacetime is valid .",
    "we examine this because we have considered the case of @xmath117 , which may be critical .",
    "we require @xmath118 this condition is also satisfied for @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in the end",
    "the two conditions do not add new constraints on the model .",
    "now , let us discuss the detectability of relic monopoles in this model .",
    "first , we investigate how the long - range term of the monopole mass density , @xmath121 , contributes to the cosmological mass density , where @xmath36 is the distance from a monopole core to an observer .",
    "hiscock @xcite derived the condition that the averaged mass density of multiple global monopoles does not exceed the cosmological mass density , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath122 .",
    "his result is equivalent to @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the number of monopoles in the the present horizon volume , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 is the present density parameter .",
    "this indicates that the existence of even one monopole is critical for @xmath119 . to see it more closely",
    ", we consider the condition that the local density by one monopole does not exceed the cosmological mass density , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath127 .",
    "this leads @xmath128 which shows that the center of a monopole should be located farther than the horizon .",
    "a more stringent constraint is obtained by considering the difference of @xmath129 at both ends of the observed universe : @xmath130 the condition @xmath131 leads @xmath132    we now argue the plausible value of @xmath36 realized in this model . by assumption",
    "our universe was once in the core of a monopole with @xmath133 and the higgs field started classical evolution only after it had acquired an amplitude @xmath134 .",
    "the number of @xmath98-folds after this epoch is approximately given by @xmath135 for @xmath136 and @xmath137 , we find @xmath138 .",
    "that is , the initial core radius becomes @xmath139 times as large as the present horizon .",
    "we therefore conclude that the core of a monopole is located so far from the observed region that even its long - range term @xmath140 does not exert effective astrophysical influence .",
    "because this conclusion is irrelevant to the long - range term , it suggests that a local monopole in the same model is not detectable either .",
    "we have considered inflating monopoles in the bd theory .",
    "first , we have investigated the dynamics and spacetime structure of a global monopole . in the einstein theory ,",
    "monopoles undergo eternal inflation if and only if @xmath141 .",
    "in the bd theory , on the other hand , the ratio @xmath22 decreases until inflation ends .",
    "that is , if @xmath22 is large enough initially , a monopole starts to expand ; however , after the ratio becomes smaller than the critical value @xmath23 , the monopole turns to shrink .",
    "this behavior is quite different from that in the einstein gravity and gives another mechanism to terminate inflation , which , however , is irrelevant to our universe .    secondly , we have examined cosmological constraints on the parameters , which stems mainly from density perturbations .",
    "the cobe normalization requires @xmath142 , @xmath108 for @xmath52 , implying that inflation in our universe must have ended in the standard manner as @xmath31 reaches @xmath0 .",
    "we also calculate the spectral index , which turns out to be typically around @xmath143 .    although we have concentrated on the bd theory",
    ", finally we make a brief discussion on the behavior in general theories ( [ action2 ] ) .",
    "we still assume @xmath144 .",
    "the slow - roll conditions for the models are @xmath145 and the behavior of @xmath57 is given by @xmath146 these show that , if @xmath147 , @xmath148 increases and the slow - roll conditions eventually break down .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the finite duration of topological inflation is a general nature in generalized einstein theories .",
