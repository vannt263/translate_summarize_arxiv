    "constructing martingales with given marginal distributions has been an active area of research over the last decade ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( here and in the entire paper , marginal distributions ( also marginals ) refer to the 1-dimensional distributions . ) a condition for the existence of such martingales is given by kellerer @xcite ( see hirsch and roynette @xcite for a new and improved proof ) .",
    "three constructions of markov martingales with pre - specified marginal distributions were given by madan and yor @xcite , namely the skorokhod embedding method , the time - changed brownian motion and the continuous martingale approach pioneered by dupire @xcite .",
    "recently , hirsch _",
    "et al_. @xcite gave six different methods for constructing martingales whose marginal distributions match those of a given family of probability measures .",
    "they also tackle the tedious task of finding sufficient conditions to ensure that the chosen family is indeed increasing in the convex order , or as they coined it , a peacock .    in this paper , we deal with a different , albeit related , scenario",
    ". we do not start with a family of probability distributions , rather we start with a given martingale ( the existence of which is assumed ) and produce a large family ( as opposed to just a handful ) of new martingales having the same marginal distributions as the original process .",
    "we say that these martingales `` mimic '' the original process .",
    "this same task was undertaken in @xcite for the brownian motion .",
    "it gave rise to the papers @xcite and @xcite ( who coined the term faked brownian motion ) .",
    "albin @xcite and oleszkiewicz @xcite answered the question of the existence of a continuous martingale with brownian marginals .",
    "however , their constructions yield non - markov processes .",
    "et al_. @xcite then generalised albin s construction and produced a sequence of ( non - markov ) martingales with brownian marginals . in this paper , we extend the construction of @xcite to a much larger class of processes , namely self - similar markov martingales .    before formulating a solution to this problem",
    "we give a brief account on the origin and relevance of the mimicking question to finance , and more specifically to option pricing ; that is the pricing of a contract that gives the holder the right to buy ( or sell ) the instrument ( a stock ) at a future time @xmath2 for a specified price @xmath3 .",
    "the theoretical valuation of an option is performed in such a way as not to allow arbitrage opportunities ",
    "arbitrage occurs when riskless trading results in profit .",
    "the first fundamental theorem ( e.g. , @xcite , page 231 ) states that the absence of arbitrage in a market with stock price @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is essentially equivalent to the existence of an equivalent probability measure under which the stock price is a martingale .",
    "( here without loss of generality , we let the riskless interest rate be zero . )",
    "the second fundamental theorem ( e.g. , @xcite , page 232 ) implies that the arbitrage - free price of an option is given by @xmath6 $ ] , where the expectation is taken under the equivalent martingale measure . in the classical model of black and",
    "scholes the stock price @xmath4 is given , under the martingale measure , by the exponential brownian motion @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is known as the volatility , and is assumed to be a constant .",
    "the resulting expectation produces the well - known black  scholes formula for option prices .",
    "however , empirical evidence shows that in order to match the black ",
    "scholes formula to market prices of options one needs to vary @xmath8 . as a consequence it is natural to ask whether there exist alternative models of stock prices that result in a prescribed option pricing formula , such as black  scholes .",
    "finally , it is easy to see that the collective knowledge of @xmath9,k\\geq0\\}$ ] determines the distribution of @xmath10 or the marginal distribution , for example @xcite . therefore , if one wants to keep the option prices given by the original formula but without the limitations of the original process ( such as constant volatility ) one has to look for martingales ( to have the model arbitrage free ) with given marginals ( to keep the same option prices ) .",
    "this question received much attention in the last ten years , see the pioneering work of madan and yor @xcite .    throughout this paper , we assume that all processes are cdlg and progressively measurable",
    ". we will use the notation @xmath11 to mean equal in distribution for random variables or equal in finite - dimensional distributions for processes , and this will be clear in the context . for a given random measure @xmath12 , the measure @xmath13 for @xmath14",
    "is defined by @xmath15 .",
    "we will also write @xmath16 $ ] to mean the measure defined by @xmath17 = \\mathbb{e}[\\int g(x ) m(\\mathrm{d}x)]$ ] for any positive function @xmath18 .",
    "we start with a martingale @xmath19 which is also a markov process , that is , for any bounded measurable function @xmath18 , @xmath20 = \\mathbb{e}[g(z_t)|z_s]$ ] for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the natural filtration of @xmath23 .",
    "we aim to construct new processes that will have the same marginal distributions as @xmath19 while retaining the martingale and markov properties .",
    "we assume further that @xmath19 is self - similar , that is , there exists a ( strictly ) positive function @xmath24 such that @xmath25 for all @xmath14 . for @xmath19 to be non - trivial and stochastically continuous at @xmath26 , we must have ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that @xmath27 for some @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 ( which implies that @xmath30 ) .",
    "we then say that @xmath19 is self - similar with exponent @xmath31 , or simply , @xmath31-self - similar .",
    "denote the transition function of @xmath19 by @xmath32 for @xmath21 .",
    "then the self - similarity of @xmath19 translates to the following scaling property on @xmath33 : @xmath34 if @xmath35 is the infinitesimal generator associated with @xmath33 , this scaling property is equivalent to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the operator defined by @xmath38 . from this",

    "we will see that this is equivalent to time - changing the process together with an appropriate scaling .",
