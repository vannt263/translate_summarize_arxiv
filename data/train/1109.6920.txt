    "the ahm has not been solved exactly , except in special cases , and appears to have a rich phase diagram .    over the past decade ,",
    "there has been considerable interest in anderson localization in strongly - correlated metals near half filling . at half filling , coulomb interactions can induce a gapped ",
    "mott insulating \" state , and the question is how states near the mott state are affected by strong interactions .",
    "this is particularly relevant to the cuprate high temperature superconductors , where the electronic properties are tuned by chemical doping .",
    "chemical doping , in addition to changing the carrier density ( and therefore proximity to the mott state ) , disorders the materials .",
    "experiments have generically found states exhibiting characteristics of anderson localization that lie between the metallic and mott insulating phases.@xcite the location of the metal insulator transition ( mit ) appears to be a function of both the itinerant hole density and the level of disorder , but not the residual ( @xmath0 ) resistivity,@xcite which hints at a possible failure of the conventional one - parameter scaling theory.@xcite more generally , these experiments raise the possibility that the anderson mit in strongly correlated materials may differ qualitatively from that in conventional weakly correlated metals .    in this work , we use the ahm to study the effects of strong correlations on anderson localization .",
    "the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian is @xmath1 where the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 refer to sites on a @xmath4-dimensional lattice , where @xmath5 annihilates a spin-@xmath6 electron from site @xmath2 , @xmath7 is the number operator for site @xmath2 , and where @xmath8 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to nearest - neighbor hopping , so that @xmath9 if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are nearest neighbors and @xmath10 otherwise .",
    "disorder is introduced via the site energies @xmath11 , which are chosen randomly from a uniform distribution of width @xmath12 ( so @xmath13 ) .",
    "the ahm is therefore characterized by three energy scales : the kinetic energy @xmath14 , the short range coulomb interaction @xmath15 , and the disorder strength @xmath12 .",
    "a rough schematic phase diagram for the half - filled ahm in three dimensions is shown in fig .  [ fig : phasediag ] ( the phase diagram in lower dimensions has not , to our knowledge , been established ) .",
    "this phase diagram is based on a number of published calculations@xcite which , while they disagree on details , agree on general features .",
    "note that we have chosen to show the simplest nonmagnetic phase diagram ( in which magnetic phases are suppressed ) and have omitted phases that are not universally seen .",
    "there appears to be consensus on the strong disorder limit of the phase diagram : as a function of increasing @xmath15 , there is a continuous transition from a gapless anderson insulator to a gapped mott insulating state at @xmath16.@xcite an interesting , recently - discovered wrinkle in this picture is the existence of a kinetic energy - driven zero bias anomaly in the density of states,@xcite which was found in the one and two dimensional ahm and should presumably be present in higher dimensions .",
    "there is less consensus on the phase diagram at weak and intermediate disorder .",
    "some calculations have predicted that the density of states vanishes continuously at the mit in two@xcite and three@xcite dimensions while dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) finds that the density of states is discontinuous across the mit , and variational monte carlo@xcite calculations predict a first order mott transition .",
    "although experiments are often complicated by the occurrence of broken - symmetry phases , paramagnetic mott transitions in real materials are generally found to be consistent with dmft.@xcite the details of the @xmath17 mit are important since they affect the electronic properties of the metal adjacent to the mott transition . to illustrate this point , we consider a simple weak - coupling expression for the screened random potential @xmath18 . within mean - field theory , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the spatially - averaged charge density and @xmath21 . for weak disorder , @xmath22 .",
    "a rough estimate for the charge susceptibility is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the single - spin density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "then @xmath25 in a weak - coupling metal , @xmath24 depends only weakly on @xmath15 and the overall effect of increasing @xmath15 is to screen the disorder potential . on the other hand , in a gapped insulator , @xmath26 and the impurity potential",
    "is unscreened .",
    "while eq .",
    "( [ eq : vi ] ) applies to weakly - correlated insulators , we also expect screening to vanish in ( strongly - correlated ) mott insulators because the charge is unable to rearrange itself in response to the disorder potential",
    ". the screened potential should therefore be a nonmonotonic function of @xmath15 , obtaining a maximum value somewhere between small @xmath15 ( where eq .",
    "( [ eq : vi ] ) holds ) and the critical value @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , several calculations have found that the impurity potential becomes unscreened as @xmath28 for strong disorder.@xcite    on the other hand , dmft predicts that , for weak disorder , a narrow quasiparticle band develops at the fermi energy near @xmath29 , such that the density of states remains finite up to @xmath29 .",
    "it has been shown that because this band tends to be pinned to the fermi energy , impurity scattering within the band is reduced.@xcite in fact , for a particle - hole symmetric band , a weak impurity potential is predicted to be _ perfectly _ screened as @xmath28 .",
    "this remarkable result has , to our knowledge , only been found in dmft calculations and has not been confirmed by other theoretical techniques .    in this work ,",
    "we study persistent currents in an anderson - hubbard lattice threaded by an aharonov - bohm flux and focus on the region of strong correlations near the mott transition .",
    "these currents are affected by both the disorder potential ( which tends to localize the quasiparticles ) , and by strong correlations ( which reduce the quasiparticle spectral weight ) .",

    "we present results for two cases : quarter filling where correlations are relatively weak , and half filling where correlations are strongest .",
    "we find that , while the quarter - filling results are consistent with one - parameter scaling , there is evidence for a breakdown of one - parameter scaling at half - filling when the interaction strength @xmath15 is greater than the disorder strength @xmath12 .",

    "it is sufficient to include spatial inhomogeneity only in @xmath40 when the disorder is not too strong ; it is only for strong disorder ( relative to the bandwidth ) that a spatially varying @xmath42 and @xmath48 are essential .",

    "we shall see in the next section that although these two product states produce almost identical results for small @xmath33 , they make quantitatively different ( although qualitatively similar ) predictions for the persistent current when @xmath33 is large .",
