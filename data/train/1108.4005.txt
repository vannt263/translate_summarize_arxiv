    "the top forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry ( @xmath4 ) measured at the tevatron has drawn a lot of attention during the past few years .",
    "the most recent updated data from cdf and d0 are @xcite @xmath5 in the @xmath6 rest frame , whereas the sm prediction @xcite based on mcfm is @xmath7 @xcite . recent calculations of the top fb asymmetry at the next - next - leading - log ( nnll ) do not differ much from the aforementioned sm predictions , and the sizable discrepancy still remains @xcite .    motivated by this discrepancy , numerous suggestions have been made on how to explain the observed large top fb asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the models can be categorized into the following : colored spin-1 ( axigluon , coloron , kaluza - klein gluon , etc . )",
    "exchange in the @xmath8-channel , light @xmath1 or @xmath9 exchange in the @xmath10-channel , color antitriplet or sextet in the @xmath11-channel , color - singlet scalar exchange in the @xmath10-channel , and effective lagrangian approaches .",
    "some models could be tested at the lhc .",
    "for example , the original light @xmath1 model @xcite is excluded by the recent cms data on the same sign top pair production @xcite .",
    "however , most models are phenomenologically motivated by the top fb asymmetry . and the issues related with flavor dependent gauge symmetry , anomaly cancellation and renormalizable yukawa couplings were not properly addressed .",
    "when one considers a complete model including new particles and interactions needed for the top fb asymmetry , there could be additional degrees of freedom that might contribute to the top fb asymmetry",
    ". therefore it may be premature to conclude which model is favored or not .",
    "this could be especially the case for models based on a new spin-1 particle .",
    "independent of the top fb asymmetry , the cdf collaboration reported an interesting excess on the dijet production associated with a @xmath2 boson in a dijet mass range between 130 gev and 160 gev with an integrated luminosity of @xmath12 fb@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the excess could be interpreted as the production process @xmath14 followed by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 pb with @xmath17 gev . a possible candidate for @xmath18",
    "is a light @xmath19 boson @xcite .",
    "various resolutions without invoking the @xmath19 boson also have been proposed to reconcile the cdf @xmath20 excess @xcite .",
    "the excess was confirmed by the cdf collaboration with larger data , but was not confirmed by the d0 collaboration @xcite .",
    "it would be remained to be seen if the cdf @xmath20 excess survives in the future , but it would be desirable to calculate the typical size of @xmath21 in new physics model under consideration .    recently , the present authors proposed an extension of the standard model ( sm ) where flavor - dependent @xmath3 charges were assigned to the right - handed ( rh ) up - type quarks @xcite , and they made the light @xmath1 model of ref .",
    "@xcite for the top fb asymmetry complete and realistic by constructing full renormalizable and anomaly free models with flavor dependent charge assignments to the right - handed up - type quarks .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the light @xmath1 solution , which is now disfavored by the same sign top pair production constraint by the cms collaboration @xcite , could be revived because there are additional @xmath10-channel contributions from the neutral ( pseudo ) scalar higgs bosons to the top fb asymmetry and the same sign top pair production .",
    "there is destructive interference among @xmath1 and neutral ( pseudo ) scalar higgs bosons in the latter observable , making the light @xmath1 scenario with light neutral ( pseudo)scalar bosons still a viable solution to the top fb asymmetry .",
    "such models suffer from the constraints from flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and the process involving top quarks , so that the charge assignments have to be controlled . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors concentrated on the cases that the nonzero charges are assigned only to the right - handed up - type quarks , and demonstrated that the models provide a possible resolution of the top forward - backward asymmetry @xcite , the cdf @xmath20 excess  @xcite , and cold dark matters ( cdms ) . in this paper , we elaborate on these models considering various @xmath22 charge assignments to the sm quarks , and including @xmath22 charged higgs doublets that are to be introduced in order that we can write renormalizable yukawa couplings for the sm fermions .",
    "flavor - dependent @xmath3 charge assignments would require the extensions of higgs doublets in order to realize realistic mass matrices with renormalizable yukawa couplings , if the sm fermions have chiral @xmath3 charges . since the right - handed up - type quarks in the models of ref .",
    "@xcite and this paper have flavor dependent couplings whereas other fermions have flavor universal couplings , the sm fermions ( at least the right - handed up - type quarks ) have chiral @xmath3 charges so that we have to introduce @xmath3 charged higgs doublets in order to write the realistic yukawa couplings for all the sm fermions and generate their masses . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , such extra @xmath23 higgs doublets may enhance the @xmath24 . in our model",
    ", it turns out that the top fb asymmetry and the same sign top pair production receive contributions not only from the @xmath3 gauge boson , @xmath25 , but also from neutral scalar higgs , pseudo - scalar higgs , and charged higgs . as we see in the sec.[sec : phenomenology ] , such higgs contributions play an important role in achieving the favored region for the top fb asymmetry without conflict with the same sign top pair production , and can accommodate the cdf @xmath20 signal when the excess is confirmed in the future",
    ".    our models would not be anomaly - free without extra chiral fermions .",
    "one simple way to realize anomaly - free theory is adding one extra generation and two sm gauge vector - like fermion pairs .",
    "the added fields may also contribute to observed signals and raise new predictions .",
    "in fact , fcnc problems will be triggered in some cases , but stable particles , which become cdm candidates , will be guaranteed because of @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , such flavor - dependent @xmath3 symmetric models may be known as the froggatt - nielsen model ( fn ) @xcite , where the yukawa terms are expressed by the power of a sm gauge singlet , @xmath26 .",
    "this model is not renormalizable , but @xmath25 and neutral scalar higgs fields can contribute to @xmath27 .",

    "only sm gauge vector - like pairs , such as @xmath72 introduced in sec .",

    "if we assume that the mass terms of @xmath33 and @xmath35 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , are very large , we can integrate out @xmath33 and @xmath35 , and we could realize effective one @xmath23 doublet model which corresponds to the fn - type model , @xmath81 however , in this parameter region , only neutral scalar higgs boson would contribute to the low - energy physics . in the next section , we will discuss a simple case like the fn - type model with only neutral scalar higgs , but we will notice that pseudo - scalar and charged higgs play an important role to evade the same - sign top bound . in such a case , at least two of higgs doublets should have masses around weak scale , with nonzero vevs .",
    "this would be another way to observe that the fn - type model would not describe the top fb asymmetry and the same sign top pair production properly .",
    "in this section , we discuss phenomenology of our models , especially the top forward - backward asymmetry , the same sign top pair production and the @xmath20 signal . in the fn - type model , the higgs contribution would be generically small , because of the small ratio @xmath82 and the corresponding yukawa suppression or assuming that @xmath26 is very heavy .",

    "this is because the contribution to the @xmath6 production from the diagonal coupling @xmath93 and @xmath94 would be small because the interference terms between the sm qcd contribution at leading - order in @xmath95 and the @xmath8-channel diagram mediated by the @xmath19 boson vanish .",
    "there is no strict bound for the mass @xmath96 of the @xmath19 boson in our models , but it is assumed to be around the ew scale . since the @xmath19 boson does not couple to the charged lepton and neutrinos by construction , stringent bounds on an extra @xmath19 boson from electroweak ( ew ) precision tests at lep ii and drell - yan processes at the tevatron and lhc could be avoided .",
    "if the @xmath19 boson is heavier than the top quark mass and has diagonal couplings to the sm quarks , its mass could be constrained by dijet production results at hadron colliders . in the relatively low mass region",

    "this type of dark matter has been well investigated in ref .",
    ".    it might be possible to consider charge assignments which only require the one extra generation .",
    "if the mixing between extra quarks and sm quarks is forbidden by @xmath3 charge , we may need extra @xmath23 doublet scalar which has yukawa coupling with extra quarks and sm quarks .",
    "if the extra higgs does not get vev , the neutral component could be a cdm candidate  @xcite .",
    "this case also predicts large cross section through @xmath243 and @xmath25 bosons .",
    "let us summarize our results . in this paper , we constructed a complete @xmath3 model for flavor dependent couplings to the right - handed up - type quarks in the sm , and discussed the top fb asymmetry , the cdf @xmath20 excess and cold dark matters .",
    "we first described the flavor dependent and leptophobic chiral @xmath3 models , and introduced new higgs fields and fermions for the renormalizable yukawa couplings for the sm fermions and the anomaly cancellation , respectively .",
    "then the couplings of the sm fermions to the new @xmath25 and new flavored higgs doublets ( in terms of the ( pseudo ) neutral / charged higgs fields ) were derived , and were used for the top fb asymmetry and the cdf @xmath20 excess as well as the same sign top pair production at the lhc .",
    "we found that the interference effects between the @xmath25 and the higgs bosons generally improves the overall description of the @xmath253 production cross section at the tevatron and the top fb asymmetry , their @xmath254 distributions , and reduce the production cross section for the same sign top pair at the lhc .",
    "our model for the top fb asymmetry can be tested in the near future at the tevatron and the lhc by measuring @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and the single top production without the @xmath223 quark in the final states ( @xmath257 ) .",
    "also the spin - spin correlations of @xmath6 and the longitudinal polarization of ( anti)top quark @xcite could be useful for testing our models based on the light @xmath258 and @xmath119",
    ". it can not be too much emphasized that the ( pseudo ) scalar higgs bosons in our models are not added by hand , but should be included in the chiral @xmath3 flavor model of ref .",
    "it is simply inconsistent to do phenomenology without them .",
    "and most interestingly , these new higgs doublets charged under @xmath3 not only help the models viable as a solution for the top fb asymmetry , but also can accommodate the cdf @xmath20 excess for @xmath259 through @xmath260 , which is a kind of bonus when we made a completion of light leptophobic @xmath25 with flavor dependent couplings to the rh up - type quarks . by making the light @xmath25 model for the top fb asymmetry",
    "mathematically consistent in terms of anomaly cancellation and physically realistic in terms of renormalizable yukawa couplings , we found that the models come with new ingredients that could also accommodate other phenomena such as the cdf @xmath20 excess or the cdm of the universe .",
    "there are still constraints we did not touch in this paper , such as @xmath261 parameter . in our models , extra higgs doublets are charged under @xmath3 and induce the mixing between @xmath243 and @xmath25 .",
    "for example , the tree - level contribution will be written down by the form linear to @xmath262 in 2hdm , so that our parameter choice must be consistent with the small mixing .",
    "we are sure that small @xmath262 , @xmath263 , can realize large @xmath138 elements and enough large @xmath20 excess without exceeding the observed @xmath261 parameter @xcite .    finally , we would like to note that our conclusions about extended multi higgs doublets ( with some of them being @xmath22 flavored ) and the related phenomenology would be generically true for many flavor gauge models with chiral couplings to the sm fermions . some features obtained in this paper",
    "may be specific to our explicit models , depending on the new matter contents we introduce in order that we achieve the gauge anomaly cancellation and also allow the necessary yukawa couplings .",
    "our strategies can be adopted in any other attempts to construct realistic flavor models for the top fb asymmetry and the cdf @xmath20 excess as well as @xmath264 mixing in terms of flavor changing @xmath25 .",
    "this statement will apply to axigluon models , extra @xmath265 model , or flavor @xmath244 model for the right - handed up quarks ( namely the models with chiral gauge interactions )",
    ". it would not be enough to include only spin-1 vector bosons in order to discuss the top fb asymmetry or the same sign top pair productions .",
    "it is mandatory to construct the entire lagrangian including the realistic renormalizable yukawa couplings , including new higgs doublets that are charged under the chiral flavor gauge groups under consideration , in order to discuss the top physics .",
    "new higgs doublets that are charged under chiral gauge symmetry group can modify the top fb asymmetry , the same sign top pair productions and the @xmath20 .",
    "it will remain to be seen if the predictions on the top fb asymmetry , the same sign top pair and related phenomenology depends strongly on the additional higgs doublets in addition to the original spin-1 gauge bosons ( axigluon , @xmath25 , @xmath265 or @xmath244 flavor gauge bosons ) effects .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 flavor models for leptophobic @xmath1 with flavor dependent couplings to the right - handed up - type quarks in the standard model , which can accommodate the recent data on the top forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry and the dijet resonance associated with a @xmath2 boson reported by cdf collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> such flavor - dependent leptophobic charge assignments generally require extra chiral fermions for anomaly cancellation . </S>",
    "<S> also the chiral nature of @xmath3 flavor symmetry calls for new @xmath3-charged higgs doublets in order for the sm fermions to have realistic renormalizable yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the stringent constraints from the top fb asymmetry at the tevatron and the same sign top pair production at the lhc can be evaded due to contributions of the extra higgs doublets . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the extension could realize cold dark matter candidates . </S>"
