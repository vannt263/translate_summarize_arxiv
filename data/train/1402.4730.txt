    "identifying the physical mechanism responsible for coronal heating is still standing as one of the grand challenges of contemporary solar physics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for different theoretical and observational viewpoints ) .",
    "nearly a quarter of a century ago , @xcite began exploring in earnest the possibility that coronal heating could be due to thermal energy released by small magnetic reconnection events occurring continuously throughout the magnetized corona ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for related physical scenarii ) .",
    "his physical picture for nanoflare production is now well - known .",
    "photospheric fluid motions associated with turbulent convection randomly shuffle the magnetic footpoints of coronal loop leading to a braiding of fieldlines throughout the volume of the loop , with which is associated an inexorable buildup of current sheets , as individual fieldlines try to return to dynamical equilibrium under the topological constraints imposed by flux - freezing .",
    "as these localized current systems build up , plasma instabilities eventually set in and lead to energy release through magnetic reconnection .",
    "parker dubbed these elementary energy release events `` nanoflares '' , went on to argue that they occur continuously throughout the corona , and conjectured that they are responsible for coronal heating .",
    "intense efforts have been expended to observationally verify or contradict parker s conjecture .",
    "this is no easy task , as it involves measuring the energy output of flares very close to the detection limit of the best current solar imagers in space . on the other hand , decades of flare observations",
    "have shown that the probability distribution function [ @xmath0 for flare energy [ @xmath1 takes the form of a power law [ @xmath2 spanning some eight orders of magnitude in energy , with @xmath3 estimated in the range @xmath4  @xmath5 ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this is too low for small flares to dominate energy input into the corona ( requiring @xmath6 ) , unless the pdf steepens abruptly below the current detection limit .",
    "this is possible but increasingly unlikely as instruments such as the euv imagers on the _ transition region and coronal explorer _ ( trace ) and _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "( sdo ) have pushed the detection limit right up to the boundary of the nanoflare regime .",
    "another possibility is that physical models used to infer thermal energy release from euv or soft x - ray fluxes are in error , due to erroneous assumptions regarding the intrinsic geometry of the flaring volume @xcite , or of the physical conditions therein , required to infer thermal energy release from observed radiative fluxes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "whatever recent observational determination of @xmath7 may imply for coronal heating , parker s scenario certainly remains a fine model for solar flares in general .",
    "although not originally emphasized by parker , his nanoflare scenario contains all ingredients now understood to be required to lead to self - organized criticality ( hereafter soc ; see , _",
    "e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : an open dissipative system  here a coronal loop  slowly driven  here by random footpoint motions  and subjected to a self - limiting local threshold instability  here magnetic reconnection . despite the slow and gradual loading of energy , such a physical system will release energy in an intermittent manner , in the form of avalanches that can span up to the whole system .",
    "@xcite have proposed an avalanche - type model for solar flares that has become a reference model in the solar context , although numerous variations have now been developed over the intervening years .",
    "the present article describes one such variation that ( we believe ) is particularly interesting in that i ) it is readily amenable to ( relatively ) unambiguous physical interpretation in terms of twisting of a coronal loop , and ii ) it can yields qualitatively distinct flaring behavior as the degree of conservation is allowed to vary .",
    "section [ sec : newmod ] briefly describes the original lu and hamilton model ( more specifically , the version put forth by * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter the  lh model  ) , along with the various manners in which we have altered the forcing and redistribution rules .",
    "section [ sec : results ] provides modelling results , comparing and contrasting the statistical properties of avalanches in the lh model and our variations thereof .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] with a discussion comparing and contrasting our models with other classes of globally and deterministically driven avalanches models developed in different physical contexts , outlining some possible model improvements , and by summarizing the implications of our modelling results for coronal heating ( and more specifically with regards to the flaring behavior of small coronal loops ) as well as solar flares predictions .",
    "following in part @xcite , @xcite developed a soc avalanche model for solar flares that by now has become a kind of `` standard '' ( for a review , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the original lu and hamilton model is a cellular automaton defined over a 3d regular cartesian grid with nearest neighbour connectivity ( top+down+right+left+front+back ) over which a vector field [ @xmath8 is defined . here",
    "we will consider instead a 2d version of the model , where a scalar nodal quantity [ @xmath9 is defined over the lattice .",
    "@xcite has shown that for the type of driving used in the lu and hamilton model , the use of a vector nodal variable yields results identical ( statistically ) to the use of a scalar variable .",
    "also , strictly speaking the term `` cellular automaton '' should be restricted to lattice models where the nodal variable is discrete ( _ i.e. _ integers mapping to a finite number of possible nodal states ) ; in cases where the nodal variable is continuous , one is dealing with a `` coupled map lattice '' .",
    "we retain `` cellular automaton '' here , because it has become common usage in this context .",
    "the superscript @xmath10 is a discrete time index , and the subscript pair [ @xmath11 identifies a single node on the 2d lattice .",
    "keeping @xmath12 on the lattice boundaries , the cellular automaton is driven by adding one small increment in @xmath13 per time step , at some randomly selected node that changes from one time step to the next .",
    "a deterministic stability criterion is defined in terms of the local curvature of the field at node @xmath14 : @xmath15 where the sum runs over the four nearest neighbours at nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "if this quantity exceeds some pre - set threshold [ @xmath18 then an amount of nodal variable [ @xmath19 is redistributed to the same four nearest neighbours according to the following discrete , deterministic rules : @xmath20 @xmath21 with @xmath22 . following this redistribution , it is possible that one of the nearest neighbour nodes now exceeds the stability threshold .",
    "the redistribution process begins anew from this node , and so on in classical avalanching manner .",
    "driving is suspended during avalanching , implicitly implying a separation of timescales between driving and avalanching dynamics , and all nodal values are updated synchronously during an avalanche to avoid introducing a directional bias in avalanche propagation .",
    "it is readily shown that these redistribution rules , while conservative in @xmath13 , lead to a decrease in @xmath23 summed over the five nodes involved by an amount @xmath24 with the energy released being `` assigned '' to the unstable node @xmath14 . if one identifies @xmath23 with a measure of magnetic energy ( more on this shortly ) , the total energy liberated by all unstable node at a given iteration is then equated to the energy release per unit time in the flare : @xmath25 a natural energy unit here , used in all that follows , is the quantity of energy [ @xmath26 liberated by a single node exceeding the stability threshold by an infinitesimal amount ; setting @xmath27 in equation  ( [ eq : erel1 ] ) immediately leads to @xmath28 this very simple model yields a strikingly good representation of flare statistics , namely the observed power law form ( and associated exponents ) of the frequency distributions of flare peak energy release [ @xmath29 , duration [ @xmath30 , and total energy release ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , equations  ( [ eq : stab1 ] )  ( [ eq : redis2 ] ) are admittedly very far removed from the mhd equations governing the process of magnetic reconnection , but there exist plausible bridges across this conceptual chasm .",
    "we adopt here a variation @xcite of the interpretative picture originally put forth by lh .",
    "the 2d lattice will be considered as a slice across a coronal loop , _ i.e. _ in cylindrical coordinates @xmath31 ( see schematic in figure",
    "[ fig : schematic_global_forcing]a ) , a slice in the @xmath32-plane , with the loop axis in the @xmath33-direction , and the lattice variable as the @xmath33-component of the magnetic vector potential @xmath34 such that @xmath35 .",
    "such a magnetic field automatically satisfies the solenoidal constraint @xmath36 .",
    "the vector potential component [ @xmath37 then defines the magnetic field component in the @xmath32-plane , which can be directly related to the degree of twist in the loop , _ i.e. _ the ratio of transversal to longitudinal field components . as argued by lh , adding small random increments of @xmath13 at one lattice node then corresponds to adding a small amount of twist somewhere in the loop , which fits nicely the parker scenario outlined above .",
    "moreover , the stability criterion becomes a threshold condition on @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _ the magnitude of the longitudinal component of the electric current , which is also satisfying from the point of view of mhd stability .",
    "this _ ansatz _ suffers from one significant difficulty , however : there is not necessarily a one - to - one correspondence between the squared nodal variable ( squared vector potential ) and magnetic energy as conventionally defined [ @xmath39 .",
    "it was nevertheless shown ( see figure 12.6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the correspondance of @xmath40 to @xmath41 is empirically almost always satisfied , in the sense that the variations of @xmath40 almost always follow the variations of @xmath41 in our model .",
    "the parker picture of random shuffling of a loop s magnetic footpoint by photospheric flows makes sense if the loop is of diameter comparable to ( or preferably larger ) than the granular length scale , and if no larger fluid motions co - exist near the base of the loop .",
    "the granular or larger scale flow otherwise displaces the footpoints in a spatially coherent manner far removed from random shuffling .",
    "one particularly interesting form of such global forcing is a twisting of the loop s footpoints ( illustrated in figure [ fig : schematic_global_forcing ] ) , which then propagates upwards and accumulates along the length of the loop [ @xmath42 .",
    "such a twisted magnetic loop can become unstable ( e.g. to a kink - type instability , @xmath43 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "local tangential discontinuities arise and associated current sheets appear .",
    "magnetic reconnections release energy locally and reduce the effective stresses [ @xmath44 , possibly restoring the loop stability [ @xmath45 .",
    "note also that the final stable state [ @xmath1 is not necessarily twist - free ; it is generally composed of a particular pattern of stresses resulting from the past reconnection history in the loop .",
    "this form of global forcing and energy release mechanism has a direct equivalent in our 2d cellular automaton . working in cylindrical coordinates @xmath31 , with the loop axis in the @xmath33-direction",
    ", the total magnetic field can be written as @xmath46 identifying now the nodal variable @xmath13 with @xmath47 sampled on the lattice , consider the following deterministic , global driving mechanism : @xmath48 where the parameter @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is a measure of the driving rate . with @xmath51 on the boundaries ,",
    "the soc state is peaked at the center of the lattice , and far enough from the latticed boundaries is characterized by near - axisymmetry about the lattice center .",
    "this implies that @xmath52 is primarily in the @xmath53-direction .",
    "the above driving mechanism thus amounts to a geometrical increase of @xmath54 by a factor @xmath55 after @xmath10 driving iterations , while @xmath56 remains unaffected .",
    "in other words , the degree of twist within the loop increases geometrically as well .",
    "the stability criterion based on the magnitude of the longitudinal component of the electric current then becomes a natural criterion on the intensity of the current sheet(s ) developing in the loop .",
    "in addition , @xmath54 is increasing in direct proportion to @xmath47 everywhere in the loop , which means that associating @xmath23 summed over the lattice with magnetic energy is entirely realistic in this context .",
    "all avalanche models discussed in the remainder of this article make use of this global , deterministic driving scheme . as in the lh model , driving is interrupted during avalanching , which amounts to assuming that the driving timescale is much longer than the avalanching timescale , a reasonable assumption in the solar coronal context ( for a discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "similar global , deterministic driving schemes have been used extensively in the context of soc models of seismic faults , based on a cellular automaton representation of the burridge  knopoff stick  slip model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the main difference from our model resides in their stability criterion that applies to the nodal variable rather than , in our case , to its curvature .",
    "a global , deterministic driver has also been used by @xcite in their cellular automaton model of magnetospheric substorms generation in the earth s central plasma sheet . to our knowledge , @xcite have been the only authors to explore deterministically driven avalanche models in the context of solar flares .",
    "they used a slightly modified version of the original model of @xcite , in which the threshold triggering the avalanching behavior applies is defined on the nodal variable rather than its curvature . in the present study ,",
    "we use the latter criterion , which is naturally inherited from the original lh model .",
    "evidently , the form of deterministic driving embodied in equation  ( [ eq : detdrive ] ) precludes using the initial condition @xmath57 . in what follows",
    "we typically use a lattice having reached the soc state via the original lh model , and then switch to deterministic driving .",
    "this will typically lead to a transient phase during which the lattice reajusts to the new driving scheme , and/or other altered model components , as discussed presently .",
    "this transient phase is usually accompanied by a gradual change in the total lattice energy , so that monitoring the latter is the best way to ascertain the recovery to a statistically stationary avalanching state .      directly incorporating the deterministic driving rule given by equation  ( [ eq : detdrive ] ) within the lu and hamilton model",
    "yields a deterministic cellular automaton characterized by a periodic cycle of energy loading / unloading , all energy release events having the same magnitude .",
    "to recover soc - like behavior , some stochastic element need be reintroduced somewhere in the model .      consider the following , plausible stochastic variation on the lu and hamilton redistribution rules : the same amount of nodal variable [ @xmath19",
    "is always removed from any unstable site , following the @xcite prescription , but it is distributed randomly , rather than equally , amongst its four nearest neighbours : @xmath58 where the @xmath59 ( @xmath60 are random deviates uniformly distributed in @xmath61 $ ] , and @xmath62 . this scheme will be referred to as _ random redistribution_. note that here that some particular random sequences and node configurations may lead to negative energy release from the redistribution process .",
    "we avoid such unphysical events by permuting the four random numbers over the neighbouring nodes and then sometimes generate four new random numbers until a positive energy is released by the avalanche .",
    "another means of introducing stochasticity is to retain equal redistribution to nearest neighbours , but let the quantity @xmath63 extracted from the unstable node be drawn from a bounded distribution of uniform random deviates @xmath64~,\\ ] ] while retaining equations  ( [ eq : redis1 ] )  ( [ eq : redis2 ] ) for the redistribution _ per se_.",
    "the lower bound in equation  ( [ eq : redis5 ] ) ensures that the redistribution will , at worst , restore marginal stability , while the upper bound corresponds to the setting of the lu and hamilton model .",
    "this scheme will be referred to as _ random extraction _ , and , defined in the above manner , involves no adjustable parameters once @xmath65 has been specified .",
    "a third approach is to introduce _ non - conservative _ redistribution rules . in all rules discussed so far",
    " including the original lu and hamilton rules  redistribution is conservative , in that whatever quantity of @xmath13 being extracted from an unstable node ends up in the nearest neighbours , whether in equal ( equations  ( [ eq : redis1 ] )  ( [ eq : redis2 ] ) ) or unequal ( equations  ( [ eq : redis3 ] )  ( [ eq : redis4 ] ) ) proportions .",
    "this conservation property is basically inspired by the sandpile analogy , where avalanches redistribute sand grains without creating or destroying any . with a nodal variable associated with a single component of the magnetic vector potential ,",
    "there exist no physical requirement for conservative redistribution of @xmath13 ; the important physical requirement , namely @xmath66 , is already taken care of under the current interpretive scheme , see equation  ( [ eq : bdef ] ) .",
    "a nonconservative version of the lu and hamilton redistribution rules can be defined as follows : @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 $ ] is again extracted from a uniform distribution of random deviates with a lower bound [ @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) ] , such that @xmath72 is the fraction of the redistributed quantity @xmath63 that is lost rather than redistributed .",
    "this rule thus involves one free parameter , namely the conservation parameter [ @xmath73 . a nonconservative model of this type , using fully deterministic driving , redistribution , and stability criteria , has been developed by @xcite in the context of magnetospheric substorms , and has been shown to produce avalanches with soc - like power - law distribution for event sizes .",
    "another interesting possibility is to introduce stochasticity at the level of the stability threshold .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by replacing the deterministic threshold rule given by equation ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) by extracting a value @xmath65 anew at each node of each temporal iteration from a sharply peaked normal distribution centered on some mean value @xmath74 .",
    "an important parameter in such a scheme is the width at half - maximum [ @xmath75 of the gaussian distribution ; if @xmath76 is very small ( in the sense that @xmath77 , one expects behavior similar to the conventional , fixed threshold stability rule , while a very wide gaussian turns the stability threshold into a random triggering process driven by noise .    @xcite",
    "experimented with similar random variations of the threshold rules in the context of their stochastically driven model , but report no significant variations of the results as compared to their deterministic threshold rule .",
    "as will become apparent further below , in the context of a deterministically driven model , however , interesting effects are produced in the regime @xmath77 .",
    "+ to sum up , we are displacing the stochastic element in the lu and hamilton model from the forcing rule to either the redistribution rule or the threshold rule . in the original lu and hamilton model ,",
    "avalanche dynamics is fully deterministic but the driving is stochastic .",
    "the model variations outline above move the stochastic element to the avalanche dynamics , in the context of a spatially global and fully deterministic driving mechanism that can be interpreted plausibly as global twisting of a coronal loop .",
    "in principle , fully deterministic avalanche models , _ e.g. _ the lh model with the deterministic driving defined by equation  ( [ eq : detdrive ] ) and a smooth initial condition , lead to a regular cycle of energy loading / unloading , with avalanches equally spaced in time and all liberating the same amount of energy . the challenge in reintroducing stochasticity in the stability and/or redistribution rules",
    "is to break this deterministic loading / unloading cycle ( in this context , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in the preceding section we have introduced various classes of redistribution rules based on a number of stochastic elements , as well as a stochastic threshold rule .",
    "a large number of distinct avalanche models can be constructed by picking and combining this or that model element .",
    "one could , for instance , build a fixed - threshold model using nonconservative redistribution rules ( section [ sssec : nc ] ) with equal distribution to nearest neighbors ; or a conservative rule with random distribution to nearest - neighbors ( section [ sssec : rr ] ) , in conjunction with a stochastic threshold rule ( section [ ssec : stothresh ] ) .",
    "in addition , each such model may involve adjustable parameters ( _ e.g. _ the width [ @xmath75 of the gaussian distribution from which the threshold values are extracted ) . although we have explored a vast portion of the relevant model space , in what follows we focus on a relatively small subset of such models , chosen so as to illustrate the range of behaviours possible in deterministically driven avalanche models . in order to expedite this exploration of parameter space ,",
    "most model runs were carried out on a small grid ( @xmath78 ) , but we have also recomputed a number of runs on larger grids ( up to @xmath79 ) to ensure that the results reported upon below are robust with respect to lattice size .",
    "exploration of model space quickly reveals that an important behavioral discriminant is the conservative property ( or lack thereof ) of the redistribution rule .",
    "consequently we first discuss results for a variety of conservative models ( section [ ssec : rescons ] ) , and turn subsequently to their non - conservative counterparts ( section [ ssec : resncons ] ) .",
    "we finally considers ( section [ ssec : fss ] ) the origin of the break of finite size scaling that takes place in our models .",
    "table [ tab : cons ] lists the defining rules and parameter values of a set of representative conservative avalanche models , whose properties will be discussed in the remainder of this section . here and in all that follows , unless noted otherwise all models are run on a @xmath78 lattice , use the driving scheme described by equation  ( [ eq : detdrive ] ) , and a stability threshold @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 for models with a stochastic threshold ) .",
    "a `` 0 '' entry in the second column indicates a deterministic threshold rule .",
    "the entry `` random '' in the third and fourth columns indicates use of equations ( [ eq : redis5 ] ) and ( [ eq : redis3 ] )  ( [ eq : redis4 ] ) , respectively .",

    "this is now a nonconservative model using a driving rate @xmath84 , fixed threshold and extraction , and equal redistribution to nearest - neighbors .",
    "the only stochasticity introduced here is at the level of non - conservation , with a random fraction between 0 and 90% of the nodal variable value being lost from each unstable node during redistribution .",
    "comparing to figure  [ fig : tscons]a and b , one immediately notices the absence of the very large quasi - periodic avalanches characterizing models with conservative redistribution .",
    "the lattice - energy time series now has the fractal - sawtooth form characteristic of the original stochastically driven lh model .",
    "the largest avalanches still only release a small fraction of the total lattice energy ( here about one percent at most , but much less on larger lattices ) .",

    "a larger lattice leads to larger values of the nodal variable , which explains the wider small avalanches populations observed in figure [ fig : resolution]a  b. for example , the nodal variable is of the order of @xmath104 for a lattice of @xmath79 , which corresponds indeed to the energy limit distinguishing the small avalanches from the scale - free mid - size ones .",
    "finally , the range of power - law mid - size avalanches also increases with resolution , as expected from classical results of the lh model .    unlike in the seismic - fault model ( which should be thought of , in some global sense , as periodic ) , here",

    "the two latter populations are observed to merge in the context of avalanche models incorporating non - conservative redistribution rules .",
    "we have argued that the large , quasiperiodic avalanches are the reflection of an energy loading / unloading cycle driven by our adopted global deterministic driving mechanism . even though an avalanche is always triggered at a single lattice node ,",
    "the effect of the global driver is that energy has been accumulating at _ all _ internal lattice nodes prior to avalanche onset .",
    "once the avalanche begins , this energy must be either evacuated at the open boundaries , or dissipated locally within the lattice ( in non - conservative models ) . in conservative models , only the former is possible , which leads inevitably to the buildup of very large avalanches that must connect to the boundaries  and thus end up spanning the whole system  and remain active until the excess energy has been drained away from the lattice  thus producing long duration avalanches . in that respect ,",
    "it is therefore not surprising that a distinct population of large avalanches ( and , consequently , break of finite - size scaling ) is most readily observed in models based on conservative redistribution rules .",
    "we have been careful thus far to refrain from declaring our models to be in a true self - organized critical state , using instead the term `` soc - like '' to characterize their avalanching behavior .",
    "formal demonstration of soc typically requires the computation of critical exponents , and the demonstration that the latter satisfy mutual numerical relations that place them in a specific universality class . although interesting in and of itself , the identification of the universality class to which the present model belongs is of limited interest from the point of view of flare modelling .",
    "we stress again that the models discussed in this article do satisfy all _ sine qua non _ physical conditions believed to be required for soc @xcite : a slowly driven open system subjected to a self - limiting , local , finite - threshold instability . moreover , in nonconservative models characterized by no quasi - periodic large scale events , the lack of dependence of the power - law indices of avalanches size and duration on the driving rate and lattice size certainly suggests that these models all belong to the same universality class .",
    "although non - conservative redistribution rules have received , to the best of our knowledge , little attention in the solar flare context , true soc avalanching behavior is known to materialize in non - conservative system .",
    "the most studied such soc system is the cellular automaton formulation of the stick  slip model for earthquake , introduced by @xcite . in that model ,",
    "non - conservation is related to the fact that a moving block exerts a force not only on its neighbour blocks via the connecting springs , but also on the two plates bounding ( and driving ) the system from above and below ; hence ; when an individual block moves , a fraction of the potential energy stored in the springs is dissipated as heat via friction against the bounding plates , rather than all of it ending up in other springs by the end of the avalanche .",
    "something similar also takes place in the non - conservative substorm models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there , a fraction of the energy released by an unstable magnetic flux tube within the central ( equatorial ) plasma sheet is lost via mhd waves and/or charged particles travelling away along magnetic field lines back towards earth , eventually leading to auroral excitation in polar regions .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of the latter model is its ability to simultaneously produce `` internal '' avalanches with a scale - free size distribution , and quasi - periodic boundary discharge avalanches with a well - defined mean - size .",
    "this squares well with the statistically distinct properties of auroral emission on the one hand , and ring current injection events on the other , both being in principle related manifestation of energy release events in the central plasma sheet . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "this effect materialized in part because the boundaries were set up so as to respond dynamically to incoming avalanches ; the results presented herein indicate that dual populations of energy release events , each with distinct statistical characteristics , would still materialize in such globally driven systems , even with more conventional `` open '' boundary conditions , provided conservation is high enough . finally , solar flares also exhibit non - conservative properties .",
    "flares are thought to originate from reconnection processes in coronal loops that feed on the stored magnetic energy .",
    "along with the magnetic reorganization associated with a flare , some energy is systematically lost from the system either through radiation ( direct x - ray emissions , or hard x - ray emissions triggered by reconnection - accelerated energetic particles ) , accelerated particles escape or even conduction along the magnetic field lines .",
    "we modeled those effects with a simple non - conservation parameter in the avalanching process .",
    "albeit with a quite different cellular automaton model , our results are consistent with the previous finding of @xcite : a quasi - cyclic population of large avalanches is found in both cases when the model is close to be purely conservative .    notwithstanding the presence or absence of a population of small and large avalanches , in the realm of mid - size avalanches",
    "all models are characterized by a power - law distribution of avalanche energy release spanning many orders of magnitude . in general , the corresponding power - law indices are somewhat smaller than for the lh model , implying flatter pdfs , so that all models have a power - law index smaller than the critical value @xmath107 above which the smaller flares ( _ i.e. _ avalanches ) would become the dominant contributors to coronal heating , as in parker s nanoflare hypothesis .",
    "an obvious extension of the present model is to introduce the third spatial dimension ; as argued in section [ ssec : phys ] , the 2d lattices considered herein can be best regarded as a cross section at some fixed position along a coronal loop . evidently , allowing avalanches to develop along the loop s length would yield a more realistic model .",
    "in particular , it would become possible to map the 3d lattice to a bent coronal loop , and therefore compute fractal dimensions of flares / avalanches ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the same manner as carried out from observations ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this would open a new comparative bridge between modelling and observation .",
    "the broad exploration of parameter space made possible with the computationally much less demanding 2d lattices has allowed us to pinpoint the most important parameter regime , which is found for highly dissipative redistribution .",
    "then , the way in which stochasticity is introduced in the model ( stability threshold , extraction , redistribution rules ) plays a comparatively lesser role in determining the size distribution of avalanches .",
    "in other words , the models are robust with respect to the details of stochastic effects .",
    "the present model finally provides an interesting basis for a practical use of avalanches models in the context of solar flares @xcite .",
    "the deterministic driver minimizes the level of stochasticity embedded in the model , which results in very good predictive capabilities for the larger events .",
    "interestingly , our model could provide an efficient and cheap alternative method for the prediction of large solar flares in the context of space weather .",
