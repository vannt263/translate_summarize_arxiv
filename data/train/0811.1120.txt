    "prompted by the necessity of a precise calibration of photo - detectors both in the analog and photon - counting regime @xcite , we presented recently @xcite a detailed theoretical analysis on the possibility to use the correlations of spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) light @xcite for calibrating analog detectors , as an extension of the technique developed in photon counting regime @xcite . however , while the method is suitable for analog calibration at relatively low gain , which means a photon flux lower than @xmath0 photon / s , in higher - gain regime it is limited by the difficulty of collecting the same correlated modes in the two branches @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed theoretical analysis of a scheme based on the stimulated pdc ( on the other hand a discussion of the uncertainty budget is left to a specifically addressed paper @xcite ) .",
    "we show that this scheme allow to overcome the problem mentioned above .",
    "indeed , in this case the photon fluxes can be varied by varying the power of the coherent seed beam , without increasing the parametric gain @xmath1 . on the other hand , the spdc non - classical correlation at single - photon level which enables the absolute calibration of counting detectors survives , in some form , when a coherent seed is injected and the photon flux becomes macroscopic .",
    "the schematic set - up for calibration of photodetectors by using pdc is shown in fig .",
    "1 . we model the photodetection process in the analog regime as a random pulse train @xcite    @xmath2    i.e. a very large number of discrete events at random times of occurrence @xmath3 . the pulse shape @xmath4 is determined by the transit time of charge carriers .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 is a fixed function with characteristic width @xmath5 and a unit area .",
    "the pulse amplitude @xmath6 is a random variable in order to account for a possible current gain by avalanche multiplication .",
    "the statistical nature of the multiplication process gives an additional contribution to the current fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in an ideal instantaneous photocell response , without avalanche gain , all values @xmath6 are equal to the charge @xmath7 of a single electron and @xmath8 . in the case of ideal quantum efficiency , since the probability density of observing a photon at time @xmath9 at detector @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is related to the quantum mean value @xmath12 of the photon flux , we calculate the average current output of @xmath13 as @xmath14 where the factor @xmath15 is the average charge produced in a detection event .",
    "we have assumed the response function for the two detectors to be the same , @xmath16 .    at the same time",
    ", the auto - correlation and the cross - correlation functions for the currents can be expressed as    @xmath17    respectively for @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the auto - correlation function of the photon flux at detector @xmath20 , and for @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cross - correlation between the fluxes incident on the two different detectors . by the substitution @xmath23",
    ", it is convenient to express them as    @xmath24    the second contribution , proportional to the photon flux when @xmath18 , represents the the intrinsic and unavoidable component of the fluctuation that does not depend on the specific property of the field since it generates from the commutation relation of the quantum fields in the free space .",
    "the third one is the normally ordered correlation function of the fluctuation .",
    "actually it is a function just of the difference @xmath25 and its typical variation scale provides the coherence time @xmath26 of the pdc radiation .",
    "now we introduce the quantum efficiency @xmath27 of detector @xmath10 , defined as the number of pulses generated per incident photon . in @xcite a real detector is modelled , as usual , with an ideal one ( @xmath28 ) preceded by a beam splitter with the intensity transmission coefficient equal to the quantum efficiency of the real detector @xcite . within this picture",
    "it is possible to take into account the quantum efficiency by the following substitutions : @xmath29    thus , @xmath30 being time independent , according to eq .",
    "( [ curr ] ) we obtain : @xmath31    eq . ( [ i_ji_k ] ) becomes    @xmath32    where we introduced the convolution of the response function of detectors @xmath33 .",
    "here we consider a type i pdc process . in the limit of monochromatic and plane - wave pump approximation ,",
    "only pairs of modes with opposite transverse wave vectors , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and with conjugate frequencies , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are coupled such that the energy and momentum conservation hold .",
    "the equations describing the down conversion process are the input - output transformations @xmath38 linking the fields @xmath39 and @xmath40 after the non - linear interaction to the fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 before the interaction started .",
    "the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 must satisfy the properties    @xmath45    which guarantee the conservation of the free - field commutation relations @xmath46= \\delta_{j , k}\\delta_{\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{q}'}\\delta_{\\omega,\\omega'}\\ ] ] @xmath47=0.\\ ] ] here , @xmath48 and @xmath49 define the strength of the process and at the same time the range of transverse momentum and frequencies in which it takes place and thus are named gain functions .",
    "in fact , the finite length of the crystal introduces a partial relaxation of phase matching condition concerning the third component of the momenta . by selecting a certain frequency , the transverse momentum uncertainty ,",
    "i.e. the angular dispersion of the emission direction , is not null ( @xmath50 for the non - collinear pdc , where @xmath51 is the crystal length and @xmath52 is the central angle of propagation with respect to the pump direction ) . on the contrary , by fixing the transverse momentum @xmath34 , or equivalently a direction of propagation @xmath53 , the spectral bandwidth @xmath54 is proportional to @xmath55 , and typically @xmath56s for type i.    hereinafter we will focus on the properties of the far field , observed at the focal plane of a thin lens of focal length @xmath57 , placed at distance @xmath57 from the crystal .",
    "the spatial distribution of the far field is , in this case , the fourier transform of the field just at the output face of the crystal .",
    "this special imaging configuration is convenient to show the basic of calculation , nonetheless the validity of the results is more general .",
    "thus , any transverse mode @xmath34 is associated with a single point @xmath58 in the detection ( focal ) plane according to the geometric transformation @xmath59 .",
    "the far field operator in the space - temporal domain is therefore @xmath60    the mean value of the operator @xmath61 is    @xmath62    representing the intensity profile of the emission in the detection plane .",
    "this mean value has to be calculated over the following initial state , in which the field 1 is in the vacuum state whereas the field 2 is in a multi - mode coherent state : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the complex parameter associated to this state .",
    "the seed beam is therefore represented as a coherent state of field 2 with fixed frequency @xmath65 and a certain distribution of the transverse momentum @xmath34 . here",
    "we assume that , for the modes that are stimulated by the seed , the spontaneous component of the emission is negligible with respect to the stimulated one .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption @xmath66 and , at the same time , @xmath67 , that is a typical experimental situation in which a few millimeters length crystal is pumped by a continuous pump and the seed has a power just around the microwatt or more .",
    "the intensities ( [ stim1 ] ) of the two stimulated beams after the crystal can be evaluated by using eq.s ( [ input - output ] ) , with the substitution @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to    @xmath69    we used the first property of the gain functions in ( [ unitary cond ] ) into the last line of eq .",
    "( [ stim4 ] ) , in order to show explicitly the two contributions to the beam 2 , one given by the original coherent seed and the other from the stimulated emission , proportional to the parametric gain @xmath70 .",
    "we notice that , aside from the spontaneous emission that is neglected , the generated beams conserve the original momentum distribution of the seed but weighted according to the gain function .",
    "the normal - ordered correlation function of the intensities fluctuation is defined as    @xmath71    the calculation leads to the following normal - ordered mean values : @xmath72 @xmath73 fluctuations of the stimulated field 1 are negligible , because they have the same order of magnitude of the spontaneous emission . concerning the cross - correlation we have : @xmath74 let us consider two detectors , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , to register the photons crossing the regions @xmath77 and @xmath78 centered on the two correlated bright beams in the detection plane .",
    "let the two areas be much larger than the dimension of the seed beam on the detection plane .",
    "this simply means to collect all the bright components of the emission , corresponding to the modes stimulated by the seed .",
    "we move now from the discrete modes representation of the electromagnetic field , in which it is artificially enclosed in a fictitious cube of side @xmath79 , to a continuous set of modes for @xmath80 .",
    "thus , in the following , the @xmath81-sum and the kronecker function @xmath82 in eq.s ( [ stim6 ] ) and ( [ stim7 ] ) are substituted respectively with the integral over @xmath81 and the dirac function @xmath83 .",
    "the fact that the second - order correlation function has an unphysical spatial behaviour , dominated by a delta function , comes from the starting assumption of a plane - wave pump , having infinite transverse dimension . in a realistic case the delta function is replaced by the fourier transform of the pump transverse profile .",
    "the quantum mean values of the photon fluxes @xmath84 reaching detectors 1 and 2 can be obtained integrating equations ( [ stim3 ] ) and ( [ stim4 ] ) respectively on @xmath77 and @xmath78 . by applying relations ( [ unitary cond ] )",
    "we have    @xmath85 ) and ( [ stim6 ] ) over @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively , we have the following auto - correlation functions for the photon fluxes    @xmath88    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{stim11 } \\langle : \\delta f_{2}(t ) \\delta f_{2}(t'):\\rangle&\\approx&\\sum_{\\omega}e^{-i(\\omega_{0}-\\omega)\\;(t - t')}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\int_{r_{2}}d\\mathbf{x}\\:|{\\widetilde{v}}_{2}(\\mathbf{x},\\omega)|^{2 }     here and in the following , we have assumed that in the limit of small @xmath1 the gain functions @xmath90 , according to the relations ( [ unitary cond ] ) .",
    "then , integrating eq .",
    "( [ stim7 ] ) over @xmath91 gives the following cross - correlation : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{stim12 } \\langle : \\delta",
    "f_{1}(t ) \\delta f_{2}(t ' ) : \\rangle\\approx\\sum_{\\omega}e^{-i(\\omega_{0}+\\omega)\\;(t - t ' ) } \\int_{r_{1}}d\\mathbf{x}\\nonumber\\\\    although the seed beam is monochromatic with frequency @xmath65 , the temporal width of both auto - correlation and cross - correlation in a fixed point @xmath93 still depends on the spectral bandwidth @xmath54 of the gain functions .",
    "this explains why they originate from the correlation between the monochromatic seed and the spontaneous emission that is broadband .",
    "therefore , the coherence time of the stimulated emission is still of the order of @xmath94 , analogously to the spontaneous case .",
    "the auto - correlation of the current fluctuations @xmath95 can be calculated by introducing the result in eq .",
    "( [ stim10 ] ) in ( [ i_ji_knew ] ) , obtaining    @xmath96    under the condition of small gain ( @xmath97 ) and large intensity of the seed ( @xmath98 ) the fluctuation of the current at detector @xmath75 is dominated by the shot noise component .    by substituting eq ( [ stim12 ] ) in ( [ i_ji_knew ] ) , under the same condition , for @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    ", one has @xmath101 where we assumed @xmath102 .",
    "we stress that it is the usual situation , the coherence time of spdc being on the order of picoseconds or less and the typical resolving time of detectors on the order of nanosecond . in this case",
    "any fluctuations in the light power are averaged over @xmath5 .",
    "the cross - correlation function of the fluctuations has the same form as the one obtained in the case of spontaneous down - conversion in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "this is the evidence that quantum correlations do not disappear when the emission is stimulated .",
    "in fact , the down - converted photons are still produced in pairs , although in the beam 2 the photons of the pairs are added to the bright original coherent beam propagating in the same direction .",
    "the factor 2 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ stimul - cross - corr ] ) can be interpreted as due to the fact that , for any down - converted photon of a pair propagating along direction 2 , there is also the original photon of the seed that stimulated the generation of that pair .",
    "formally it emerges from the time integration of two identical contribution in ( [ stim12 ] ) , the explicit one and its complex conjugated .",
    "since we are interested in a relatively large power of incident light , we can at first consider detectors without internal gain , and assume that the charge produced in any detection event is equal to the single electron charge @xmath103 , i.e. @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , according to eq.s ( [ stimul - self - corr ] ) and ( [ stimul - cross - corr ] ) , the quantum efficiency can be evaluated as    @xmath106    for detectors in which electrons multiplication occurs the statistic fluctuations of this process do not allow to use eq .",
    "( [ eta - stim ] ) for absolute calibration .",
    "however , it can be performed by integrating eq .",
    "( [ stimul - cross - corr ] ) over time @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to evaluating the power spectrum of the fluctuations at frequencies around zero , namely much smaller than @xmath108 .",
    "we would like to stress that in this case , the assumption @xmath16 is not necessary . since @xmath109",
    "we obtain @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ eta - stim2 ] ) the statistic of the electron gain does not play any role .",
    "with the purpose to eliminate some problems that appear when working with spontaneous pdc @xcite , we have extended our method to higher flux regimes , taking advantage of the stimulated pdc as a source of bright correlated beams .",
    "we show that this scheme allows one to overcome these former problem : an important result in view of metrology applications .",
    "indeed this result allows to link the photon counting regime with the photon rates of the traditional optical metrology supplying a single radiometric standard for all these regimes .",
    "finally , we would like to stress once more that equations [ eta - stim ] and [ eta - stim2 ] , between quantum efficiency and current fluctuations , even if identical to the ones obtained in our previous work @xcite , are here derived for a more general condition of stimulated emission .",
