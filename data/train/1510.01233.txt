    "lrll 54361 is an infrared source ( luhman et al.1998 ) located in the star forming region ic 348 sw .",
    "it presents a remarkable time variation , with its infrared luminosity increasing by a factor of 10 during roughly one week every 25.34@xmath10.01 days ( muzerolle et al . 2013 ) . as part of a 3.3 cm study of the ic 348 sw region made with",
    "the karl g. jansky very large array , rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) detected a source associated with lrll 54361 .",
    "the infrared variability was attributed to pulsed accretion from an unseen binary companion ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2013 ) . since accretion and outflow are expected to be correlated in the current paradigm of star formation ( e.g. pech et al . 2010",
    "; anglada et al .",
    "2015 ) , we believed that centimeter monitoring of this source could help better understand the origin of the ir variability .",
    "the six observations were made with the karl g. jansky very large array of nrao centered at the rest frequency of 9.0 ( 3.3 cm ) ghz during 2014 october 18 and 26 , november 10 and 19 , and december 3 and 16 , under project 14b-251 . at that time",
    "the array was in its c configuration .",
    "the phase center was at @xmath4 ; @xmath5 = @xmath632@xmath7 , approximately the radio position of lrll 54361 as determined by rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . in all observations",
    "the absolute amplitude calibrator was j1337@xmath63309 and the phase calibrator was j0336@xmath63218 .",
    "the digital correlator of the jvla was configured in 16 spectral windows of 128 mhz width each subdivided in 64 channels of spectral resolution of 2 mhz .",
    "the total bandwidth of the observations was about 2.048 ghz in a full - polarization mode .",
    "the half power width of the primary beam is @xmath8 at 3.3 cm .",
    "the data were analyzed in the standard manner using the vla calibration pipeline which uses the casa ( common astronomy software applications ) package of nrao , although for some stages of the analysis we used the aips ( astronomical image processing system ) package . for all the imaging , we used the robust parameter of clean set to 2 ( briggs 1995 ) , to obtain a better sensitivity , at the expense of losing some angular resolution .",
    "all images were corrected for the response of the primary beam , increasing the noise away from the phase center .",
    "the resulting rms of the averaged image ( over all six epochs ) was 3 @xmath2jy beam@xmath9 at the center of the field , with an angular resolution of @xmath10 with pa = @xmath11 . in table 1",
    "we give the positions , flux densities and deconvolved sizes of the sources detected , as obtained from the average image . with the exception of sources jvla 3a , jvla 3b , and jvla 4 that show marginal evidence of being slightly extended ( see table 1 ) , all other sources appear unresolved .",
    "the rms of the individual images at the center of the field was @xmath07 @xmath2jy beam@xmath9 .",
    "the only two sources that are clearly detected in the individual images at some epochs are jvla 5 ( infrared source ic 348 lrl 49 ) and jvla 6 ( infrared source ic 348 lrl 13 ) , both of which have been detected before .",
    "we follow here the nomenclature of rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for the vla sources . in table 2",
    "we show the flux densities of these two sources at each epoch of observation , that are seen to vary over an order of magnitude in timescales of days . in figure 1",
    "we show the contour image of these two sources , from the data averaged over the six epochs .",
    "these two stars are the only objects reported here that coincide with chandra x - ray sources , cxouj034357.62 + 320137.4 ( jvla5 ) and cxouj034359.67 + 320154.1 ( jvla6 ) , as reported in the study of stelzer et al .",
    "they are also two out of four sources in this region that were detected simultaneously in x - ray and radio emission by forbrich et al .",
    "our results support the interpretation of rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) that these two radio sources are associated with young stars with active magnetospheres , such as those detected in other regions of star formation ( e.g. dzib et al . 2013 ; liu et al .",
    ". this class of extremely compact radio sources has been very useful for the accurate determination of the parallax ( and distance ) to several regions of star formation ( e.g. loinard et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "jvla 1 is the radio counterpart to the variable ir source lrll 54361 and the main target of the observations reported here .",
    "it is associated with a jet - like feature to its nw that is seen in narrowband @xmath12 ( 2.12 @xmath2 m ; walawender et al .",
    "2006 ) and 1.6 @xmath2 m continuum ( muzerolle et al . 2013 ) imaging .",
    "an elongated structure is also seen to the ne in these infrared images . in a combined x - ray and cm radio study of the region , forbrich et al .",
    "( 2011 ) did not find evidence for either an x - ray or a radio source toward lrll  54361 using _",
    "chandra _ and the `` classic '' nrao vla on march 13 and 18 , 2008 .",
    "the radio sensitivity was 20  @xmath2jy ( 5@xmath13 ) per epoch in both x- and c - band .",
    "coincidentally , the first of these observations fall onto a peak of an infrared pulse in an epoch that was observed with _",
    "spitzer_. however , in jvla observations in the c configuration carried out in june 2013 , rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) detected the source with a total flux density of @xmath14  @xmath2jy ( at 9.0  ghz ) and a flat spectral index of @xmath15 ( with observations at 9  ghz and 14 ghz ) .",
    "at the same flux level , the source thus should have been clearly detected in 2008 at s / n@xmath013 , suggesting variability .",
    "the 2013 observations were carried out about 2 days after a pulse peak .",
    "the relation of the radio flux density and the phase of the infrared pulse variability was therefore inconclusive , and we carried out targeted on - peak and off - peak observations .    in our average image including all six new epochs ( see figure 2 ) , lrll 54361 has a 3.3 cm flux density of 27@xmath14 @xmath2jy , about one half of the value given from the 2013 observations of rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , 53@xmath111 @xmath2jy .",
    "we searched for evidence of direct correlation with the ir variability by making one image with the three ir - on epochs ( oct .",
    "18 , nov . 14 and dec .",
    "03 of 2015 ) and another with the three ir - off epochs ( oct .",
    "26 , nov . 10 and dec",
    ". 16 of 2015 ) .",
    "we obtain similar flux densities in these two averaged images , 23@xmath15 @xmath2jy for the ir - on epochs and 27@xmath15 @xmath2jy for the ir - off epochs .",
    "the vla observations of forbrich et al .",
    "( 2011 ) were taken on 2008 march 13 and 18 , with the latter epoch coinciding with an ir peak .",
    "the upper limits at the position of lrll 54361 in the concatenated data at x- and c - bands were in the order of 0.08 mjy ( 5-@xmath13 ) .",
    "we conclude that there is no direct correlation between the radio and ir emissions of this source . finally , this source has no reported x - ray counterpart in the observations of stelzer et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this lack of correlation between the ir and radio emissions could be attributed to the timescale of the variations .",
    "the ir emission is probably tracing phenomena that take place in the accretion disk close to the central star .",
    "given the ir variability observed , the timescale of these phenomena must be a few days or less .",
    "on the other hand , a power - law fit to the model of muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for the expected dust flux density near maximum emission at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths gives :    @xmath16 \\simeq 3.5 \\biggl[{{\\nu } \\over { 10~ghz } } \\biggr]^{2.9}.\\ ] ]    we then expect a flux density from the dust of @xmath03 @xmath2jy at 9 ghz .",
    "since we observe a flux density an order of magnitude larger ( @xmath027 @xmath2jy ) , we propose that the `` excess '' centimeter continuum emission is most probably tracing an ionized jet , as observed in several other sources ( e.g. rodrguez et al .",
    "these jets have typical detectable dimensions in the order of @xmath0100 au ( anglada et al .",
    "2015 ) . assuming a jet velocity of order 200 km s@xmath9 , this outflow is averaging the ejections over a timescale in the order of one year and smoothing out possible faster variations directly associated with the ir variability .",
    "the lack of fast , significant radio variability in jvla 1 also argues against an explanation in terms of gyrosynchrotron emission from active magnetospheres ( e.g. torres et al .",
    "2012 ) or synchrotron emission from colliding magnetospheres ( salter et al .",
    "2010 ) for the centimeter source .",
    "a lack of correlation between the infrared and radio variable emissions has also been observed for other types of objects .",
    "recently , the infrared source hops 383 was reported to have a mid - infrared  and bolometric  luminosity increase of a factor of 35 between 2004 and 2008 ( safron et al .",
    "2015 ) , becoming the first clear example of a class 0 protostar with a large accretion burst . however , galvn - madrid et al .",
    "( 2015 ) showed that in the time period between 1998 and 2014 the 3.0 cm flux density of the source varied only mildly , staying at a level between 200 and 300 @xmath2jy .",
    "these authors interpret the absence of a radio burst as implying that accretion and ejection enhancements do not follow each other in time , at least not within timescales shorter than a few years .",
    "jvla 10 is a new detection ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "it coincides within 1 `` with lrll 54362 and appears located about 16 '' to the north of jvla 1 (= lrll 54361 ) .",
    "jvla 10 is also associated with the young stellar object ic 348 3 ( evans et al .",
    "2009 ; gutermuth et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the _",
    "spitzer irac 4.5 @xmath2 m image shown in figure 1 of rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) jvla 10 appears to be associated with the head of an infrared cometary nebula to its north .",
    "this cone - shaped nebula is clearly seen in the hst images analyzed by muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , but is not shown in their paper . _      in this zone we detect the same sources reported by rodrguez et al .",
    "jvla 3a and jvla 3b are two sources separated by @xmath03@xmath17 ( see figure 3 ) and located at the center of the hh 797 bipolar outflow ( pech et al .",
    "2012 ) . while in the observations of rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) the source jvla 3b was brighter than the source jvla 3a , the roles have reversed in these new observations , indicating variability on timescales of one year .",
    "jvla 3a has lrll 57025 as its k ( 2.2 @xmath2 m ) band counterpart .",
    "jvla 3c is an interesting source associated with the submillimeter source ic348-smm2e and with a class 0 proto - brown dwarf candidate ( palau et al .",
    "2014 ) . combining the 14.0 ghz observations of rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2014 ) with those at 9.0 ghz reported here , we derive a spectral index of 0.4@xmath10.8 for ic348-smm2e , consistent with a thermal jet nature , but unfortunately the large uncertainty prevents from a more definitive characterization .",
    "faint centimeter continuum emission has been reported for a handful of other proto - brown dwarf candidates ( morata et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the nature of jvla 4 remains undetermined . except for a two - band infrared detection",
    "reported as part of the c2d spitzer final data release ( evans et al .",
    "2003 ) , it has no known counterpart at other wavelengths .",
    "the flux density reported here is 1.5 times larger than that measured in 2013 .",
    "however , the associated errors are large and the source could as well be steady .      as discussed above , jvla 10 is a newly detected radio source that is associated with the young stellar object ic348 3 .",
    "another new source is jvla 9 , at the western edge of the field of view .",
    "this source has an infrared counterpart that was flagged as a candidate galaxy by evans et al .",
    "its detection in this experiment was favoured by the fact that the phase center of these observations was @xmath076@xmath17 to the west of those of rodrguez et al .",
