    "the initial observations by the batse instrument on board the compton @xmath6-ray observatory satellite have evidenced what has later become known as the prompt radiation of grbs . on the basis of their hardness as well as their duration , grbs were initially classified into short and long at a time when their cosmological nature was still being disputed .",
    "the advent of the _ bepposax _ satellite @xcite introduced a novel approach to grbs by introducing joint observations in the x - rays and @xmath6-rays thanks to its instruments : the gamma - ray burst monitor ( @xmath7@xmath8 kev ) , the wide field cameras ( @xmath9@xmath10 kev ) , and the narrow field instruments ( @xmath9-@xmath11 kev ) .",
    "the unexpected and welcome discovery of the existence of a well separate component in the grb soon appeared : the afterglow radiation lasting up to @xmath12@xmath13 s after the emission of the prompt radiation .",
    "beppo - sax clearly indicated the existence of a power law behavior in the late x - ray emission ( lxre ; see fig .",
    "[ bepposax ] ) .",
    "the coming of the _ swift _ satellite , significantly extending the observation in the x - ray band thanks to its x - ray telescope ( xrt band : @xmath14@xmath11 kev ) , has allowed us for the first time to cover the unexplored region between the end of the prompt radiation and the power law late x - ray behavior discovered by _ bepposax _ : in some long grbs a steep decay phase was observed followed by a plateau leading then to a typical lxre power law behavior .",
    "already , @xcite noticed the unexpected result that the lxres of a `` golden sample '' ( gs ) of six long , closeby ( @xmath15 ) , energetic ( @xmath16 erg ) grbs , when measured in the rest - frame of the sources , were showing a common power law behavior ( see fig .",
    "[ scaling ] ) , independently from the isotropic energy @xmath0 coming from the prompt radiation ( see fig [ nesting ] ) .",
    "more surprising was the fact that the plateau phase luminosity and duration before merging in the common lxre power law behavior were clearly functions of the @xmath0 , while the late power law remains independent from the energetic of the prompt radiation .",
    "for this reason , this remarkable scaling law has been used as a standard candle to independently estimate the cosmological redshift of some long grbs by requiring the overlap of their lxre ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and also to predict , 10 days in advance , the emergence of the typical optical signature of the supernova sn 2013cq , associated with grb 130427a @xcite .",
    "the current analysis is based on the paradigms introduced in @xcite for the spacetime parametrization of the grbs , in @xcite for the interpretation of the structure of the grb prompt emission , and in @xcite for the induced gravitational collapse ( igc ) process , further evolved in @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in the present case",
    ", the phenomenon points to an igc occurring when a tight binary system composed of a carbon - oxygen core ( co@xmath2 ) undergoes a supernova ( sn ) explosion in the presence of a binary neutron star ( ns ) companion @xcite .",
    "when the igc leads the ns to accrete enough matter and therefore to collapse to a black hole ( bh ) , the overall observed phenomenon is called binary - driven hypernova ( bdhn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "s. ]            a crucial further step has been the identification as a bdhn of grb 090423 at the extreme redshift of @xmath17 @xcite . on top of that , the lxre of grb 090423 overlaps perfectly with the ones of the gs ( see fig . [ z8overlap ] ) , extending such a scaling law up to extreme cosmological distances .",
    "this result led to the necessity of checking such an universal behavior of the lxres in bdhne at redshifts larger than @xmath18 ( see the sample list in table [ estable ] ) .",
    "it is clear by now that the afterglow analysis is much more articulated than previously expected and contains new specific signatures .",
    "when theoretically examined within our framework , these new signatures lead to specific information on the astrophysical nature of the progenitor systems @xcite . in the present paper , we start by analysing the signatures contained in the lxres at @xmath19 s , where @xmath20 is the rest - frame time after the initial grb trigger . in particular",
    ", we probe a further improvement for the existence of such an lxre universal behavior of bdhne by the introduction of a collimation correction",

    "we probe the universality of the lxre power law behavior as well as the absence of correlation with the prompt radiation phase of the grb . in section 3",

    "such methods have been systematically adopted to different types of grbs like , for example , the short , hard grb 090510 @xcite , the high energetic long grb 130427a @xcite , the low energetic short grb 051221a @xcite , and the low energetic long grb 060218 @xcite , independently from the nature of their progenitors .    in the recent four years",

    "the treatment of the first parts of the x - ray afterglow of bdhne , namely the spike , the initial steep decay , and the plateau phase , indeed fundamental within the bdhn picture , is beyond the scope of this article and it will be extensively shown in forthcoming works ( * ? ? ?",

    "the universalities of the lxre outlined in this article are then explained within the igc paradigm , originating from the interaction of the grb with the sn ejecta .",

    "it is appropriate to point out that no achromatic `` jet - break '' effect has been observed in any of the 161 sources of our es .",
    "we recall that the achromatic `` jet - break '' effect is a consequence of relativistic jet pictures ( lorentz factor @xmath100@xmath101 ) , in which a change of slope is expected in the late x - ray light curve , which clearly does not apply in the case of the bdhn following the igc model . in this scenario ,",

    "<S> it has previously been discovered that there is a universal power law behavior exhibited by the late x - ray emission ( lxre ) of a `` golden sample '' ( gs ) of six long energetic grbs , when observed in the rest - frame of the source . </S>",
    "<S> this remarkable feature , independent of the different isotropic energy ( @xmath0 ) of each grb , has been used to estimate the cosmological redshift of some long grbs . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is extended here to a new class of 161 long grbs , all with @xmath1 erg . </S>",
    "<S> these grbs are indicated as binary - driven hypernovae ( bdhne ) in view of their progenitors : a tight binary system composed of a carbon - oxygen core ( co@xmath2 ) and a neutron star undergoing an induced gravitational collapse ( igc ) to a black hole triggered by the co@xmath2 explosion as a supernova ( sn ) . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the universal behavior of the lxre for the `` enlarged sample '' ( es ) of 161 bdhne observed up to the end of 2015 , assuming a double - cone emitting region . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a distribution of half - opening angles peaking at @xmath3 , with a mean value of @xmath4 , and a standard deviation of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , leads to the possible establishment of a new cosmological candle . within the igc model , </S>",
    "<S> such universal lxre behavior is only indirectly related to the grb and originates from the sn ejecta , of a standard constant mass , being shocked by the grb emission . </S>",
    "<S> the fulfillment of the universal relation in the lxre and its independence of the prompt emission , further confirmed in this article , establishes a crucial test for any viable grb model . </S>"
