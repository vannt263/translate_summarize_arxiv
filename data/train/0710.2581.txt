    "the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model @xcite was introduced in nuclear physics .",
    "it describes a cluster of mutually interacting spins in a transverse magnetic field . in condensed matter physics",
    ", this model is associated with a system of infinite coordination number . in earlier time , scaling behaviors of critical observables have been studied by mean field analysis @xcite , while recently the finite - size scaling of this model was studied by the @xmath0 expansion in the holstein - primakoff single boson representation @xcite and by the continuous unitary transformations ( cut ) @xcite . meanwhile , a rich structure of four different regions is revealed in the parameter space through a careful scrutiny on the spectrum @xcite . besides , the quantum criticality has been investigated by studying its entanglement properties @xcite . both the first- and second - order quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) @xcite have been revealed , in the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic cases respectively @xcite .",
    "regarding the qpt itself , the ground state of a system would undergo a significant structural change at certain critical point .",
    "this primary observation suggests a new description of qpts in terms of fidelity @xcite , a concept introduced in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "mathematically it is the overlap between two ground states in which their driving parameters deviate by a small amount .",
    "however , the fidelity depends computationally on an arbitrarily small yet finite change of the driving parameter . for this , zanardi _ et .",
    "al . _ introduced the riemannian metric tensor @xcite , while you _ et .",
    "_ suggested the fidelity susceptibility @xcite , both focus on the leading term of the fidelity , in order to explain singularities in qpts .",
    "in addition , scaling analysis of these quantities has been informative : it helps understanding their divergence and the criticality of the system @xcite , and it also reveals the intrinsic relation between the critical exponent of some physical quantities and that of the fidelity susceptibility @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explicitly compute the ground - state fidelity susceptibility and its critical exponent of the lmg model .",
    "numerical analysis is also performed to check with our analytic calculations .",
    "we show that , the @xmath0 expansion in the holstein - primakoff transformation is sufficient to determine the critical exponent of the fidelity susceptibility @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we revealed two distinct critical exponents in two phases which is not a general feature .",
    "therefore , our findings not only suggest another route on understanding the quantum criticality of the lmg model , but also show the fidelity susceptibility is not always extensive in describing the universality class of a quantum many - body system .",
    "this paper consists of five sections . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ham ] , we review the hamiltonian , symmetry , and conserved quantities of the lmg model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : criticalfs ] , we diagonalize the model hamiltonian and compute the fidelity susceptibility in the anisotropic model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scalingana ] , we perform finite size scaling analysis and discuss the scaling relation between different exponents . finally , we give a brief summary in sec .",

    "the hamiltonian of the lmg model reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the pauli matrices , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath0 is necessary to ensure finite energy per spin in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is understood that the total spin and the parity are the conserved quantities , i.e. , @xmath6 = \\left [ { h,\\prod\\limits_i { \\sigma _ z^i } } \\right ] = 0   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition , in the isotropic case @xmath7 , one has @xmath8 = 0 $ ] and simultaneous eigenstates can be found . in the main context ,",
    "the following parameter space is considered : @xmath9 .",
    "we take @xmath10 as the spectrum is invariant under the transformation @xmath11 . in addition , as a common practice we only consider the maximum spin sector @xmath12 which contains the lowest energy state .",
    "we briefly review of the concept of the fidelity susceptibility here .",
    "suppose there is a hamiltonian of a general form as @xmath13 for @xmath14 is defined as the driving term of the system , which simply does not commute with @xmath15 .",
    "the function @xmath16 coupled to @xmath14 is often considered as the linear external field @xmath17 . then the fidelity susceptibility is defined as @xcite @xmath18 ^ 2 \\sum\\limits_{n \\ne 0 } { \\frac{{\\left| { \\left\\langle { n } \\right|h_i \\left| { 0 }   \\right\\rangle } \\right|^2 } } { { \\left [ { e_n   - e_0 } \\right]^2 } } } .",

    "the fidelity susceptibility is well - defined for a non - degenerate ground state of the continuous variable @xmath22 , but it is not suitable to deal with states with good quantum numbers .",
    "the lmg model undergoes ground state level crossing when @xmath7 , the ground states are assigned the magnetization as the quantum numbers .",
    "we put our focus on the fidelity susceptibility for an arbitrary isotropy @xmath23 .",
    "one resolution is to use the bethe - ansatz solution @xcite , which is rather complicated .",
    "so we adopt the @xmath0 expansion method which was used extensively by dusuel and vidal @xcite , that corresponds to the large @xmath24 limit .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion method is done under the holstein - primakoff boson representation @xcite framework . in low energy spectrum",

    "we consider the driving hamiltonian @xmath14 responsible for the qpt , @xmath42 by transforming them into combinations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 operators , the fidelity susceptibility is calculated as @xmath45    the derivation above is only valid for @xmath46 , for @xmath30 the calculation is actually similar to the above case of @xmath46 , provided that one first rotates the @xmath47 axis to bring it along the classical spin direction .",
    "we do not show it explicitly here , but interested readers are recommended to refer to ref .",
    "we simply quote the main result , after all the procedures the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath48 the driving hamiltonians also takes a different form : @xmath49 for the hp transformation is done on the @xmath50 operators .",
    "the fidelity susceptibilities are then obtained accordingly : @xmath51    thus we obtained @xmath1 of the anisotropic lmg model in large @xmath24 limit .",
    "we first see the effect of isotropy to the fidelity susceptibility .",
    "it dominates when @xmath52 , but fades out for large @xmath22 . especially in the isotropic limit ,",
    "when @xmath53 , @xmath1 diverges when @xmath52 , but tends to zero when @xmath54 .",
    "this is the effect of the level - crossing points in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "they together form a region of criticality , and the system undergoes continuous level crossing .",
    "the fidelity susceptibility responds drastically while moving along @xmath22 .",
    "but when @xmath54 , there are no further critical points , @xmath1 naturally measures zero when moving along @xmath22 because we have @xmath55=0 $ ] .    an interesting observation is @xmath1 behaves extensively when @xmath52 even in the large @xmath24 limit . when discarding the extensive part of eq .",

    "this discrepancy may be eliminated by adopting other transformations of the driving hamiltonian .",
    "particularly , the flow of operators in the lmg model haven been studied by the continuous unitary transformation ( cut ) method @xcite .",
    "however , such discrepancy would not hinder us from getting the correct critical exponent of the fidelity susceptibility .",
    "let us emphasize the intensive property of the fidelity susceptibility , which measures the average response to some driving hamiltonians .",
    "its divergence should correspond to a critical point of a second - order qpt rather than to the increasing system size . in order to predict the critical exponent correctly , we should average the fidelity susceptibility whenever necessary . to the leading order , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fshl1 ] ) becomes @xmath57 then it comes to a key result of our paper : @xmath1 bears different critical exponents across the critical point .",
    "it diverges as @xmath58 when @xmath52 , @xmath59 when @xmath54 .",
    "it is unlike the ising model in a transverse field @xcite nor the one - dimensional asymmetric hubbard model @xcite , where the critical exponent is a single number over the phases .     as a function of @xmath22 at @xmath60 .",
    "the inset denotes the difference between the fidelity susceptibility and the extensive term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fshl1]).,width=264 ]",
    "to illustrate the scaling behavior of the fidelity susceptibility , we perform the exact diagonalization ( ed ) to solve the spectrum of @xmath61 and then calculate the corresponding fidelity susceptibility numerically .",
    "let us recall the fidelity susceptibility scaling analysis performed in the asymmetric hubbard model @xcite . according to the scaling ansatz @xcite and the obvious power - law divergence observed in fig .",
    "[ figure_fs_h05 ] , the rescaled fidelity susceptibility around its maximum point at @xmath62 is a simple function of a scaling variable , i.e. @xmath63 , \\label{eq : scalingansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the scaling function and @xmath65 is the correlation length critical exponent .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in recent studies of the fidelity susceptibility in critical phenomena , it was pointed out that the intensive fidelity susceptibility scales generally like @xcite @xmath69 around the critical point . in the last section , we have already obtained @xmath70 which is also a universal constant . then if the maximum point of the intensive fidelity susceptibility scales like @xmath71 the scaling ansatz also implies another important relation , i.e. @xmath72    we try to confirm this equality in numerically . in fig .",
    "[ figure_3 ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalingansatz ] ) is best fitted with @xmath73 . the case to determine @xmath74 is more subtle .",
    "it is because eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalingansatz ] ) remains the same form even for averaged @xmath1 , but the maximum of @xmath1 does not . to resolve this problem , we first determine @xmath74 from the  bare \" @xmath1 . by using least square fit method",

    "the results converge better for larger scaling regions . according to the trend of @xmath74 in larger system sizes",
    ", we roughly estimate @xmath77 with three effective digits [ fig .",
    "[ figure_4 ] ] .    when @xmath54 , @xmath1 is observed to be intensive [ fig .",
    "[ figure_fs_h05 ] ] . with the estimated @xmath74 and @xmath65 , the equality ( [ eq : scalingequality ] ) is satisfied with @xmath78 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath52 , @xmath79 is the intensive quantity . for @xmath80 , @xmath81 thus @xmath82 , this will give the relation @xmath83 .",
    "these two values of @xmath84 are consistent with our analytic calculation in the last section .",
    "the exponent @xmath74 , @xmath65 can also be discussed from the scaling ansatz at the critical point rather than the maximum point of a finite system , as shown by vidal , dusuel , and barthel @xcite . based on their approach , the critical exponent @xmath65 takes the value of 1/3 , and is independent of magnitude of @xmath68 .",
    "our results on the maximum simply agree with this value and can be generalized to other models where the precise critical point is not known .",
    "another scaling analysis is to examine how @xmath62 tends to the critical point @xmath85 .",
    "it should scale like @xmath86 in the large @xmath24 limit .",
    "we find @xmath87 with two effective digits for various @xmath68 .    in short",

    "in summary , we computed explicitly the fidelity susceptibility and its critical exponent of the lmg model at different isotropy .",
    "we confirmed the different critical exponents in two phases numerically by ed , which is a rather non - trivial result .",
    "several scaling exponents are also found in consistence with previous studies . since the fidelity susceptibility is believed to be able to characterize the universality class of quantum phenomena , our results therefore provide a rare explicit case for the study of fidelity susceptibility .",
