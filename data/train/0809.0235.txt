    "experimental data @xcite indicate convincingly an accelerating cosmological expansion .",
    "the substance responsible for this effect is usually called dark energy .",
    "if we speculate that the universe is filled with a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath1 , the accelerating expansion appears if @xmath2 .",
    "there are a lot of models of the dark energy : it can be explained by a non - zero cosmological constant ( probably , this is the most natural hypothesis , in this case @xmath3 ) or by presence of a global cosmic scalar field slowly moving down to the potential minimum ( then @xmath4 ) . until recently",
    ", the instance of @xmath5 did not attract considerable interest .",
    "a substance with such an equation of state ( it is usually called phantom energy ) generally possesses physically unacceptable properties , for example , the sound speed in it can be super - luminal .    nevertheless",
    "the case of @xmath6 has currently come to the attention .",
    "first of all , it does not contradict to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has turned out that small perturbations are never super - luminal at least in some substances with @xmath6 ( see @xcite as an example ) .",
    "so , a phantom energy theory can be causal .",
    "physical properties of a dark energy with @xmath7 differ markedly from the case when @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , it violates the energy domination condition @xmath9 . since this is one of the principal assumptions of the classical black hole non - diminishing theorem , a black hole mass diminishes by accretion of the phantom energy @xcite .",
    "but the difference most important for the cosmology becomes apparent when we consider expansion of the universe containing dark energy . if @xmath10 the dark energy density is not increasing ( or even decreasing ) as the universe expands .",
    "all bound systems ( such as the solar one ) remain bound forever ; the dark energy presence manifests itself only on cosmological scales .",
    "if we allow @xmath6 , the dark energy density grows and becomes infinite in a finite time .",
    "increasing gravitational repulsion produced by the phantom energy will first destroy galaxies and then any bound systems including elementary particles @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is usually called big rip . however , as we will see below , realization of such a catastrophic scenario requires the fulfilment of several supplementary conditions .",
    "even if the phantom energy prevails in the universe , the big rip does not necessarily occurs .",
    "there is another less evident consequence of @xmath7 : if dark energy is really the phantom one , the universe evolution needs not to contain a big bang .",
    "the metric of a homogeneous isotropic universe can be represented as ( hereafter we use the system of units where @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) @xmath13 = \\nonumber \\\\ = a^{2}(\\eta)\\,[\\,d\\eta^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2\\ , ] \\label{a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we have already mentioned , presence of the phantom energy in the universe is not enough in itself to produce the big rip .",
    "this phenomenon appears , for instance , if the coefficient averaged over the universe contents @xmath14 .",
    "however , it is beyond reason to believe that @xmath15 remains constant during the cosmological evolution . in order to illustrate this",
    "let us at first consider a very simple situation when a universe contains only uniformly distributed phantom energy with an ordinary lagrangian @xmath16 for such a field @xmath17 hereafter a dot over a symbol denotes derivative with respect to time @xmath18 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath19 one can see that @xmath15 is not a constant : it depends on the amplitude of the field and on the potential energy density @xmath20 .",
    "this question has been discussed in close detail in @xcite . to summarize briefly the results : if the potential is not very steep ( grows slower than @xmath21 ) then @xmath15 tends to @xmath22 , and the density becomes infinite only when @xmath23 .",
    "so , no big rip appears in this case , though the universe reaches the planck density in a finite time . for steeper potentials a big rip singularity appears even if @xmath24 .",
    "even the parameter @xmath15 can tend to @xmath25 for a very steep @xmath20 . finally , if @xmath20 has a maximum , @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that a very steep potential is necessary to provide a constant @xmath5 : for any polynomial potential , for instance , @xmath15 tends to @xmath22 .    as an illustration",
    "let us consider the simplest case of @xmath28 .",
    "the einstein equation can be written as @xmath29 then the equation of motion @xmath30 takes the form @xmath31 initially the phantom field @xmath32 rapidly grows as well as the hubble constant @xmath33 in accordance with ( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "in due course , the friction term @xmath34 becomes very large , and the phantom field remains almost constant .",
    "for this regime we have @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and ( [ a5],[a6 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath37 it is easy to see that no big rip occurs and @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , equations ( [ a7 ] ) are closely analogous to those describing the chaotic inflation in the early universe @xcite . in both the instances the scalar field and its energy density changes very slowly , and the universe evolves in a quasi - de - sitter regime .",
    "the only difference is that in the case of chaotic inflation the field slowly decreases , while in the considering case it slowly increases ( usually it is called slow - climb ) .    in case of another potential @xmath20",
    "the university evolution dynamics can be quite different , in particular , the slow - climb may be lacking .",
    "rapid universe expansion , however , is a common feature of all phantom - containing models .",
    "indeed , the density of the phantom matter ( contrary to the normal one ) grows with time , and finally it begins to dominate .",
    "then even in the softest case of @xmath38 ( that is not exactly a phantom energy ) the scalar factor @xmath39 grows exponentially ; if @xmath20 is steep , the expansion can be much faster .",
    "so , if the universe contains phantom energy , it eventually comes to an inflation - like stage .",
    "the second effect that is able to prevent the big rip is a possible phantom energy interaction generating normal particles .",
    "the normal substance gives positive contribution to the pressure that decreases the @xmath15 value averaged over the universe contents .",
    "eventually the big rip may be prevented .",
    "it is generally believed that the phantom energy does not interact with normal matter , but it can not be absolutely true , if for no other reason than the gravitational interaction .",
    "let us consider a toy illustration for a start . as noted above , in the phantom scenario increasing gravitational repulsion produced by the phantom energy",
    "will finally destroy even elementary particles .",
    "we consider a hadron ( more precisely , a quark - antiquark pair @xmath40 ) ripped by the gravitational forces . ] where @xmath41 is the constituent quark mass , @xmath42 is the typical hadron radius . using the condition @xmath43  gev and taking @xmath44  mev , @xmath45  cm and @xmath46 , we obtain for the density of the phantom energy @xmath47  g/@xmath48 when the distance between the quark and antiquark increases , the color field lines of force between them are pressed together into a string - like region .",
    "the gravitational repulsion stretches the color lines of force until the increasing potential energy becomes sufficient to create another @xmath40 pair .",
    "it divides the string on two strongly - coupled @xmath49 pairs , but they are also ripped up by the gravitational repulsion .",
    "so , this leads to intensive hadron production in the moments just before the big rip .",
    "another mechanism of normal matter generation in the phantom - dominated universe is particle production in the cosmological gravitational field . in the modern universe",
    "this effect is completely negligible , but if the universe is phantom - dominated , its density ( and , consequently , the gravitational field ) grows with time making the particle production very intensive . in @xcite",
    "the process was considered under assumption that the universe is filled with a perfect fluid with @xmath50 .",
    "the influence of the normal matter on the universe expansion was neglected .",
    "it was shown that if the conformal time @xmath51 is chosen so that @xmath52 , and the density becomes infinitive when @xmath53 , the generated normal matter density can be written as @xmath54 in order to examine the problem in more detail we consider a universe filled with a perfect fluid with @xmath55 .",
    "initially we neglect the particle production",
    ". then the cosmological equations can be easily solved .",
    "it is convenient to choose the following initial conditions : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( we denote the phantom energy density by @xmath59 and its initial value by @xmath56 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath60 is taken so that the density becomes infinitive when @xmath53 .",
    "we obtain @xmath61 now the particle production can be added with the help of ( [ a8 ] ) .",
    "we will consider the generated substance to be relativistic , i.e. with the equation of state @xmath62 .",
    "then the system of cosmological equations can be written as @xmath63 the hubble constant is given by the equation @xmath64 there is no accurate estimation of the @xmath65 value , but we can avoid this difficulty choosing properly the initial density @xmath56 . indeed , comparing ( [ a8 ] ) and ( [ a9 ] ) , one can see that the density of the normal matter grows faster , and eventually it becomes comparable with the phantom one .",
    "this is the moment of our interest .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to take @xmath66 , i.e. to choose the initial moment so that the initial phantom density is only hundred times higher then the normal one . since the particle production is a weak effect , this value of @xmath56 must be quite high .",
    "results of the ( [ a10]-[a12 ] ) system integration with the aforecited boundary conditions are represented on fig .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig2 ] .",
    "it is convenient to use @xmath67 instead of @xmath33 and @xmath68 instead of @xmath18 in order to avoid the dependence of the graphs from the uncertain parameter @xmath56 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the hubble constant grows progressively slower , reaches its maximum @xmath69 , and begins to decrease . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath15 constantly increases from the initial value that is close to @xmath70 .",
    "finally it becomes positive .",
    "of course , both the effects result from the high growth fraction of the normal matter in the universe that makes a positive contribution to the pressure .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that @xmath71 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , @xmath56 is a very big quantity , so , @xmath69 must be also quite large .",
    "extension of the solution to @xmath72 makes no sense : the equation ( [ a8 ] ) is obtained under the assumption that the dynamics of the universe expansion is determined only by the phantom energy .",
    "it becomes inapplicable when the fraction of normal matter gets noticeable .",
    "it seems reasonable to contend , however , that in the course of the phantom - dominated universe evolution the quantity of normal matter becomes comparable with the phantom one , and the value of @xmath15 grows hindering from the big rip . to this",
    "we can add that we have considered the case of @xmath73 , which claims an extremely steep phantom field potential @xmath20 , as we could see above .",
    "for a more realistic case of the polynomial potential @xmath15 tends to zero even in the absence of normal matter. this makes the occurrence of the big rip highly unlikely .",
    "of course , the suggested model is ingenuous .",
    "intensive phantom field may interact in some other way decaying into normal matter .",
    "whatever the mechanism of the transformation may be , the universe after it has the following properties :    1 .",
    "it has just passed through the stage of very rapid ( at least , exponential ) expansion .",
    "2 .   it is flat and homogeneous .",
    "it is normal matter - dominated .",
    "the hubble constant is very large .",
    "it is precisely these physical conditions that existed in our universe @xmath74 milliard years ago , just after the inflation .",
    "if we assume that the inflation was caused by the phantom field ( as we could see , the equations of the phantom cosmology ( [ a7 ] ) are able to be closely analogous to those of the chaotic inflation @xcite ) , this makes possible to construct a model of universe evolution that does not contain a big bang .",
    "the universe leaves inflation being matter - dominated .",
    "as it expands the density of matter decreases , while the phantom density grows : eventually the universe passes into the phantom - dominated stage . as this takes place , the total density and the hubble constant stop diminishing and begin to increase .",
    "gradually the expansion becomes very fast , leading to an inflation - lake stage .",
    "finally the phantom field decays into normal matter , and the cycle repeats .",
    "thus , the universe eternally expands , while its density and other physical parameters oscillate over a wide range , never reaching the plank values .",
    "the universe evolution has no singularities like a big bang or a big rip .",
    "the foregoing model of self - reproducing cyclic universe evolution is , in a certain sense , a return to the steady state theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , in both the cases the universe expands forever with no big bang , and the matter is generated by the decay of some field ( in our case this is the phantom field ) .",
    "the difference is that in the classical steady state universe this process goes on constantly providing constant universe density , while in the considering case the universe evolves cyclically returning to its original state , but the density varies within wide limits .",
    "presence of the evolution allows to avoid most difficulties inherent to the classical steady state model .",
    "thus , the considering model may be called the steady state _ on the average _ universe .",
    "the presence of the inflation - like stage in the considering scenario solves most of the problems appearing in an inflationless cosmological theory @xcite .",
    "the size of the universe during this stage increases so much that an observer in the after - inflation epoch can see only a small part of it .",
    "consequently , the universe looks very flat and homogeneous .",
    "moreover , as we could see ( [ a7 ] ) , it is possible to choose the model of the phantom energy so that even the dynamics of the inflation - like stage is similar to the standard chaotic inflation scenario @xcite .",
    "is the proposed model valid for the real universe ?",
    "the answer to this question is currently not known with certainty , primarily because of the absence of direct experimental proofs of the phantom matter existence .",
    "a non - zero cosmological constant is quite enough to explain the experimental data . on the other hand ,",
    "observational data show that allowed values of the parameter @xmath15 of the modern universe ( at @xmath75 ) lie between @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "so , the existence of the phantom energy is not experimentally forbidden .    theoretical status of the phantom energy is also vague .",
    "there are a lot of lagrangians known , which describe fields with the necessary properties .",
    "it is still unclear , however , whether it is possible to introduce such a lagrangian , completely free from paradoxical physical effects like super - luminal sound speed , catastrophic quantum instability of the vacuum etc .",
    "nevertheless , if the phantom energy does exist , the considering model is an interesting instance of cosmological solutions containing no singular points like a big bang or a big rip .",
    "it is worthy of note that , though in our case the universe density never reaches infinity ( or , more precisely , planck density ) , all the physical parameters vary over a very wide range and amount up to extremal values .",
    "so , the universe passes through the stages that can be called physically critical .",
