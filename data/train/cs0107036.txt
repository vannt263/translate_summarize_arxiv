    "gnu texmacs  @xcite is a free ( gpl ) word processor which    * typesets texts and mathematical formulae with very high quality ( like latex ) , * emphasizes the logical structure of a document rather than its appearance ( like latex ) , * is easy to use and intuitive ( like typical wysiwyg word processors ) , * can be extended by a powerful programming language ( like emacs ) , * can include postscript figures ( as well as other figures which can be converted to postscript ) , * can export latex , and import latex and ` html ` , * supports a number of languages based on latin and cyrillic alphabets .",
    "it uses tex fonts both on screen and when printing documents .",
    "therefore , it is truly wysiwyg , with equally good quality of on - screen and printed documents ( in contrast to lyx which uses x fonts on screen and calls latex for printing ) .",
    "there is a similar commercial program called scientific workplace ( for windows ) .",
    "texmacs can also be used as an interface to any cas which can generate latex output .",
    "it renders latex formulae on the fly , producing cas output with highest typesetting quality ( better than , e.g. , _ _ , which uses fixed - width fonts for formula output ) .",
    "a user can utilize editing facilities of texmacs : copy ( a part of ) a previous input into the new one , edit it and sent to the cas , copy a result derived using the cas into a paper , etc . in the present talk ,",
    "i give some examples of using _ _ , _ _ and _ _ via texmacs .",
    "it is not my aim to describe these powerful and complex cass ; i only show examples of typesetting produced by texmacs .",
    "this talk has been written in texmacs and exported to latex .",
    "_ _ is one of the oldest and most mature cass .",
    "it was developed at mit during the end of sixties  beginning of seventies .",
    "later , it was owned by various commercial companies .",
    "now it seems practically dead .",
    "fortunately , a free cas _ _ is now under gpl .",
    "it is based upon the _ _ code base from seventies , with a number of later enhancements .",
    "it incorporates a lot of mathematical knowledge , is stable and well tested . from its very beginning , _ _ ( and _ _ ) pays much attention to mathematical correctness ; for example , if the form of an integral depends on the sign of a parameter , it will ask the user about it , or use an assumption  other systems only recently incorporated similar facilities .",
    "it is an excellent platform for research projects , because it provides a solid foundation , and it can not vanish into thin air as commercial systems ( e.g. , _ _ ) can do at any moment .",
    "its text - based interface now looks somewhat old - fashioned . when combined with a nice graphical interface provided by texmacs",
    ", it can compete with commercial cass like _ _ and _ _ , and even produce higher - quality output . and",
    "it is difficult for commercial vendors to beat the price :  )",
