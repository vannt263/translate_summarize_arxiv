    "the @xmath1 reaction is attracting attentions of both theoretical and experimental groups and is bound to play a significant role in photonuclear reactions much as the @xmath2 played in the past .",
    "apart from the work of the valencia group which i will report here , there is work by other groups .",
    "a simplified model containing many of the important features of the reaction was worked out in @xcite and improved in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the model of @xcite contains more mechanisms than the one of @xcite , presently under revision @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the model of @xcite incorporates an approximate unitarization prescription which allows one to go to higher energies with the model . in ref .",
    "@xcite a simplified model is also used incorporating , however , some @xmath3 decay channels . this work has been revised in @xcite in view that some mass distribution was in disagreement with the data , and a new parametrization is offered , which relies on a range parameter for the @xmath3 of the order of @xmath4 , which would not accommodate easily other known facts of phenomenology as the isovector @xmath5 s - wave amplitude .",
    "the model of @xcite contains parameters determined solely from @xmath6 and @xmath7 couplings to nucleons and resonances plus known properties of resonance decay with some undetermined sign borrowed from quark models .",
    "the @xmath8 reaction has also been studied at threshold with the aim of testing chiral perturbation theory @xcite , particularly the @xmath9 reaction where chiral loops are very important .",
    "the @xmath10 reaction was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite using effective lagrangians , which incorporate the couplings of the photon and pion to the nucleon and resonances .",
    "the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) resonances were taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath3 as an intermediate state coupling to two pions was also considered .",
    "the model reproduces fairly well the experimental cross section @xcite .",
    "the model is further improved @xcite to account for @xmath15 waves in the @xmath16 decay , while at the same time reduces from 67 to 20 the number of feynman diagrams needed to study the reaction in the range of mainz energies @xmath17 . in ref .",
    "@xcite this simplified model is used to evaluate cross sections for all other charge channels : @xmath18 .",
    "the agreement with the data is overall good but some discrepancies remain in the peak of the @xmath19 reaction and its charge conjugate one , the @xmath20 reaction , recently measured @xcite .",
    "the relevance of this reaction for the resonance field is the novel information that it provides on the @xmath13 resonance , which i try to explain here . in fig .",
    "1a , i show the dominant diagram in the @xmath21 reaction .",
    "it is the @xmath22 kroll ruderman or gauge term . on the other hand in fig .",
    "1b , i show a diagram where the @xmath23 is photoexcited from the nucleon and then it decays into @xmath24 , the @xmath25 decaying later into @xmath26 .    from the 1/2 and 3/2 experimental @xmath13 helicity amplitudes we can construct an effective lagrangian from where we obtain a transition operator given by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is a spin transition operator from spin 1/2 to spin 3/2 . furthermore , we write the @xmath16 transition operator as    @xmath29 t^{\\dagger \\lambda } \\quad + \\;h .",
    "c. \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is the isospin 1/2 to 3/2 transition operator and @xmath31 the pion mass .",
    "the choice of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is not arbitrary .",
    "it allows @xmath32 decay in @xmath33 and @xmath34 waves and provides a @xmath35 dependence of the amplitudes ( @xmath35 is the cm pion momentum ) which provides the best agreement with experiment . by means of eq .",
    "( 2 ) we can write the @xmath33 and @xmath34 wave decay amplitudes in @xmath36 .",
    "we find    @xmath37 a_d = \\frac{\\sqrt{4 \\pi}}{3 } \\ ; \\tilde{g}\\ ; \\frac{\\vec{q}\\,^2}{\\mu^2 } \\ , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    and the width is given by    @xmath38    from the analysis of the @xmath39 reaction of ref .",
    "@xcite one has information on @xmath40 plus also another ingredient , the relative sign of @xmath41 to @xmath42 which is positive . with this information",
    "we obtain @xmath41 and @xmath42 up to a global sign ( a sign relative to the @xmath43 amplitudes ) .",
    "this sign is the first novel thing that the @xmath44 reaction provides .",
    "indeed we can see in fig .",
    "2 the results with the two signs and we observe that while one of the signs is in good agreement with the experiment ( a ) , the other choice leads to unacceptable results ( b ) .",
    "the reason for the so different results with the two signs is that the @xmath13 mechanism of fig .",
    "1b interferes with the dominant one of fig .",
    "the two amplitudes ( by taking the s - wave part of the @xmath45 decay ) have the same momentum and spin structure , and the @xmath13 piece can be accounted for by making a simple substitution in the @xmath46 kroll ruderman piece :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the @xmath13 propagator .",
    "we can see that with the value @xmath49 and @xmath50 one gets a constructive interference before the @xmath14 pole and a destructive one after it .",
    "this is what can be observed in fig .",
    "2 .    i shall not discuss here the other channels .",
    "some results and comments can be found in the talk of krusche in this workshop @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 is well reproduced and here the @xmath13 term does not show up through the interference but as the main term by itself .",
    "on the other hand there are some discrepancies in the @xmath19 channel which we can not explain so far .",
    "with the values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 obtained from a fit to the @xmath33 and @xmath34 wave partial decay widths of @xmath53 and the global sign given by the @xmath10 experiment , the amplitudes @xmath54 of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) provide a definite @xmath35 dependence of these amplitudes .",
    "as mentioned , this @xmath35 dependence is the one providing an optimal fit to the experiment .",
    "we have checked that any other @xmath35 dependence of the s - wave amplitude , consistent with the value for the on shell decay width , provides a worse agreement .    at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning the repercussion of these results in the quark models .",
    "this has been shown recently @xcite . in this work a nonrelativistic constituent quark model using the input of badhuri s model @xcite , adapted by silvestre - brac to the baryonic sector @xcite ,",
    "is employed , and the decay amplitudes @xmath55 are evaluated . for this purpose one starts with a coupling of pions to quarks    @xmath56    and makes a nonrelativistic expansion keeping recoil terms    @xmath57 .\\ ] ]    now , when evaluating the @xmath58 transition matrix elements , since one has a radial excitation in the @xmath59 state , one needs to expand the exponential in the first term of eq .",
    "( 7 ) ( direct term ) up to order @xmath60 . on the other hand , the second term of eq .",
    "( 7 ) ( recoil term ) already gives a contribution keeping the unity in the expansion of the exponential .",
    "hence , we find    @xmath61    a direct evaluation of the @xmath33 and @xmath34-wave amplitudes for the @xmath16 decay gives    @xmath62    which implies    @xmath63 a_s + a_d \\",
    ", \\propto & \\hbox{rec } \\ ; \\propto \\ ; 1 \\end{array}\\ ] ]    hence , the non relativistic constituent quark model keeping recoil terms makes very clear predictions on the @xmath35 dependence of the amplitudes .",
    "now , by looking at the @xmath35 dependence demanded by the @xmath64 reaction , expressed in eq .",
    "3 , we obtain    @xmath65    which is the exactly the @xmath60 dependence provided by the quark model with recoil terms , eq .",
    "( 10 ) .",
    "the global sign of these amplitudes prefered by the @xmath66 experimental data is also the one provided by the quark model .",
    "this is another accomplishment of these quark models , but one should recall that not all variants of nonrelativistic , or relativized quark models will satisfy these new constraints .",
    "this is important to note since problems still remain when one comes to absolute values of these amplitudes@xcite .",
    "extra work is needed to explain these discrepancies , but it is important that these improvements are done respecting the new constraints found thanks to the @xmath10 reaction . actually , a treatment similar to the present one but making an expansion in terms of @xmath67 instead of @xmath68 seems to lead to very much improved results , while keeping the consistency with the findings discussed in this section @xcite .",
    "assume the @xmath69 reaction occurs inside a nucleus and one of the pions , say the @xmath70 , is produced off shell and absorbed by a second nucleon .",
    "one obtains then meson exchange current mechanisms which contribute to the ( @xmath71 ) reaction in nuclei and which would be represented by diagrams like those in fig .",
    "1 with the @xmath7 line attached to a nucleon line .",
    "this mechanism has already been explored in @xcite where it was found to contribute significantly to the @xmath72 reaction at large momentum transfer .",
    "in addition , the coherent @xmath0 photoproduction process in nuclei has been studied in @xcite and has shown very interesting features tied to the isospin structure of the amplitudes . a photon coupling to a nucleon",
    "can have an isoscalar and isovector component .",
    "assume we have the coherent reaction occurring in isospin @xmath73 nuclei    @xmath74    and let us take the isoscalar part of the amplitude .",
    "this will force the @xmath75 system to have @xmath73 and , because of symmetry , even angular momentum @xmath76 the isovector part will force the @xmath77 system into @xmath78 .",
    "this is forbidden for the @xmath79 system , so only the @xmath80 can go with @xmath78 , which forces @xmath81 the dynamics of the elementary reaction is such that the @xmath82 reaction is dominated by the diagram of fig . 1a , where the photon behaves as an isovector , while this mechanism is forbidden for @xmath79 production .",
    "obvious consequences of that are that the @xmath80 system is largely suppressed when the pions travel together ( @xmath83 and hence @xmath84 .    similarly the @xmath79 system is only produced in @xmath73 and hence the pions prefer to travel together .",
    "on the other hand the strength of the isoscalar part of the @xmath69 amplitude is much smaller than the isovector part in the model of @xcite and the consequence of it is that the maximum of the @xmath79 cross section is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the maximum of the @xmath80 one .",
    "these are very strong tests of the model which should encourage the experimentalists to perform such reactions .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite can be extended to virtual photons coming from the @xmath85 vertex .",
    "these reactions are presently under experimental investigation at tjnaf @xcite .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 production processes where there is a @xmath24 in the final state , ie . @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( with @xmath88 . only 8 diagrams of the model of @xcite",
    "contain a @xmath89 in the final state and we depict these diagrams below in fig .",
    "3    the evaluation of the amplitudes for these reactions requires the extension of the model of @xcite to account for the zeroth component of the electromagnetic current and the implementation of adequate form factors .",
    "this task has been undertaken in @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 we show the results obtained for the cross section of the virtual photons , defined in the standard way    @xmath90    with @xmath91 and @xmath92 the flux factor and the polarization of the virtual photon @xcite . the results are shown for the @xmath86 reaction as a function of @xmath93 and averaged over the range @xmath94 in order to compare with the data .",
    "as one can see , the agreement is fair but more precise data are expected to come soon which will impose stronger constraints on the theory .",
    "we have developed recently a model for the @xmath96 reaction which contains terms coming from chiral lagrangians , @xmath89 excitation and roper excitation @xcite .",
    "the model is depicted in fig .",
    "the excitation on the second nucleon and antisymmetry are incorporated in addition . summarizing the results we find that the @xmath59 excitation terms ( 4 - 7 ) , where the @xmath59 decays into @xmath97 are largely dominant close to threshold in the channels where the two pions can be in @xmath73 in the final state , like the @xmath98 reaction . on the other hand in the @xmath99 reaction the @xmath100 excitation terms are the most important .",
    "the comparison of these two channels allows us to appreciate the role played by @xmath59 excitation in some of the isospin channels which , as we can see , is essential to understand the experiment at low energies . in fig .",
    "6 , we show the cross sections for the @xmath101 and @xmath102 reactions .",
    "the calculations are done with plane waves , but the results are increased at lower energies when final state interaction is considered , and the agreement with experiment is improved . in the figures ,",
    "the total cross sections are given by the solid lines , corresponding to two different options for the @xmath97 decay@xcite .",
    "one of the important ingredients in this reaction is that the largest strength for @xmath59 excitation comes from isoscalar exchange .",
    "the strength of this transition was obtained from a theoretical analysis @xcite of the @xmath103 reaction on proton targets exciting the roper resonance @xcite .    in conclusion",
    "we have seen several reactions involving two pions in the final state . in all of them",
    "the @xmath59 resonances play an important role and we have clarified the links between some resonance properties and observables in @xmath0 production reactions .",
    "further investigations both theoretical and experimental , extending the work at higher energies , look also like a fertile land to extend our knowledge about @xmath59 resonance properties .",
