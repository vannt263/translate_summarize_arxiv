    "the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect is an example of the new physics that has emerged from the enormous progress made during the past few decades in material synthesis and device processing @xcite . since its discovery @xcite , experiments on fqh systems have continued to reveal many new phenomena and surprises .",
    "filling factors may take the values @xmath2 or @xmath3 , in which @xmath4 and @xmath5 are integers .",
    "all these spark interest to theoretical work of the fqh system . in 1983",
    "laughlin proposed his celebrated wave functions as an explanation of the fqh effect for two - dimensional electron gas with filling factors @xmath6 @xcite . shortly after that",
    ", hierarchical generalizations of these fully polarized states were also proposed for filling factors @xmath7 , with odd - denominator fractions @xcite .",
    "subsequently , jain pointed out that the fqh effect of electrons can be physically understood as a manifestation of the integer quantum hall effect of composite fermionic objects consisting of electrons bound to an even number of flux quanta @xcite . however , the observation of fractions such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite points to new physics beyond the integral quantum hall effect of composite fermions .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite presents extensive experimental evidence for the considerable strength of these interactions observing the appearance of fqh effect states at filling factors @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , located between the minima of the primary fqh effect sequences .    despite the success of the microscopic theories , it is important to develop an effective - field - theory model analogous to the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity .",
    "zhang , hansson and kivelson constructed the bosonic chern - simon field theory ( zhk model ) of the laughlin states describing the fqh states as the bose condensation of a ( bosonic ) field @xcite , from which all the essential features can be derived @xcite .",
    "girvin and macdonald @xcite and read @xcite also discovered a hidden order parameter in the fqh system .",
    "they proposed a field - theory model , containing a complex scalar field @xmath0 coupled to a vector field @xmath14 with a chern - simon action ( or topological mass term ) .",
    "this model exhibits vortex solutions with finite energy and fractional charge which can be identified with laughlin s quasiparticles and quasiholes . by adding a natural magnetic term to the field - theory model of girvin and macdonald , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that the fqh system admits stable topological as well as non - topological vortex solutions and the physical significance of the  topological \" vortices corresponds to quasiparticles and quasiholes .",
    "these successes certainly make the effective - field approach extremely appealing .",
    "recently , the intrinsic spin hall effect has been theoretically predicted for semiconductors with spin - orbit coupled band structures @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the spin quantum hall liquid is a novel state of matter with profound correlated properties described by a topological field theory @xcite .",
    "we can see that the topological properties play an important role in the fqh system .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to study the fqh system from the point of view of topology .",
    "we introduce a topological method , the @xmath0-mapping topological current theory , which provides a powerful method in researching some topological properties .",
    "it has been effectively used to study topological characteristic of dislocations and disclinations continuum @xcite , the topological properties of magnetic monopoles in superconductors @xcite and the knotted soliton in two - gap superconductors @xcite . by making use of the @xmath0-mapping theory ,",
    "the self - dual vortices are investigated in the frame of the zhk model in the fqh system .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section1 ] , by studying the bogomolnyi first - order self - dual equation , we point out that there exist self - dual vortices in the fqh system and research their inner topological structure . in sec .",

    "the fqh effect appears in a two - dimensional electron system in a strong magnetic field .",
    "it is known that in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime the kinetic action for a gauge field can be either the maxwell term or the chern - simon term , or both .",
    "@xcite has shown that there can be a bogomolnyi - type bound for the energy functional in a pure abelian chern - simon theory . in this paper , we start with the lagrangian of the zhk model @xcite @xmath15 which just contains the pure abelian chern - simon term . here",
    "@xmath16 is the statistical chern - simon gauge field , the external gauge field @xmath17 describes the external magnetic field , the constant @xmath18 denotes a uniform condensate charge density . since in a two - dimensional system , a spinless electron may be represented as a hardcore boson carrying an odd integer of dirac flux quanta , when the chern - simon coupling @xmath19 takes the values @xmath20 one can regard this as the condensing of the fundamental fermion field into bosons by the attachment of an odd number of flux through the chern - simon coupling @xcite .",
    "we consider a @xmath21-function contacted interaction with @xmath22 , then the potential can be written as @xmath23 , in which @xmath24 .",

    "the chern - simon gauge field opposes and cancels the external field , thus the fqh effect can be viewed as the condensation of the hardcore bosons . since the chern - simon constraint is @xmath27 @xcite ( where @xmath28 is the chern - simon gauge field tensor ) , we learn that the minimum energy solutions have density @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath19 takes the values of eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) .",
    "these are exactly the conditions for the uniform laughlin states of filling fraction @xmath30 , at which there exist @xmath31 times as many vortices as there are electrons , each vortex representing a local charge deficit @xmath32 .",
    "according to the identity @xmath33 , in which @xmath34 $ ] , the static energy can be reexpressed as @xmath35\\\\ \\nonumber   & = & \\int{d^2x } \\left[\\frac{1}{2m}|d_{\\pm}\\phi|^2\\pm\\frac{1}{2mk } ( \\rho-\\kappa{b}^{ext})^2\\right . \\\\",

    "then the energy is bounded below by a multiple of the total magnetic flux and obeys a bogomolnyi - type lower bound , which is achieved by the field satisfying a set of first - order self - dual equations @xmath38    furthermore , by investigating the above bogomolnyi self - dual equations , we will see there exist the self - dual vortices in the fqh system .",
    "it is known that the complex scalar field @xmath39 can be regard as the complex representation of a two - dimensional vector field @xmath40 over the base manifold , and it is actually a section of a complex line bundle on the base spacetime manifold . from the two - dimensional vector field @xmath40 , we can define the unit vector field @xmath41 this is a reasonable representation , @xmath42 is a two component vector field related to the order parameter field @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , it can be looked upon as a smooth mapping between the two - dimensional space @xmath43 ( with the local coordinate @xmath44 ) and the two - dimensional euclidean space @xmath45 , @xmath0 : @xmath46 and @xmath47 a section of the sphere bundle @xmath48 .",
    "clearly , the zero points of the @xmath49 field are just the singular points of the unit vector field . in the following , by virtue of the so - called @xmath0-mapping theory",
    ", we will point out that , when @xmath42 field possesses several zero points , there exists a topological term , taking the form of the @xmath21-function .",
    "from the first case of self - dual equations @xmath50 , by separating the real part from the imaginary , we obtain @xmath51 . from the second case , i.e. @xmath52 , by repeating the same process , we get @xmath53 .",
    "then we have @xmath54 . in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime ,",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath55 .",
    "according to above equations , we have @xmath56 noticing the relation @xmath57 and the well - known green function relation in @xmath0-space @xmath58 , one can prove that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the jacobian .",
    "so the bogomolnyi self - dual equation ( [ selfdual ] ) can be written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the field density .",
    "this equation is more exact than the usual self - dual equation in the zhk model @xcite @xmath63 in which the first term @xmath64 on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) has been ignored all the time . from our previous work , obviously , the first term of eq .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) describes the topological properties of the self - dual fqh system .",
    "as for usual self - dual equation ( [ usualself ] ) , it only describes the non - topological properties of the system .    in order to investigate the topological properties of the fqh system in more detail ,",
    "let s introduce a topological current in terms of the topological term @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the jacobian vector . from eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) , we can see that the topological current does not vanish only at the zero points of the @xmath1 field .",
    "so it is necessary to study the zero points of the @xmath1 field to determine the nonzero solution of the topological current .",
    "the implicit function theory @xcite shows that under the regular condition @xmath67 , the general solutions of @xmath68 can be expressed as @xmath69 , which represent the world lines of @xmath70 moving isolated singular points .",
    "these singular solutions are just the self - dual vortices in the fqh system . in @xmath21-function theory @xcite",
    ", one can prove that @xmath71 is the hopf index of the @xmath0-mapping , which means that when @xmath72 covers the neighborhood of the zero point @xmath73 once , the vector field @xmath1 covers the corresponding region in @xmath0 space @xmath74 times .",
    "with the definition of vector jacobian , we can obtain the general velocity of the @xmath75-th vortices @xmath76 then the topological current @xmath77 can be written as the form of the current and the density of the system of @xmath70 classical point particles with topological charge @xmath78 moving in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the brouwer degree of the @xmath0-mapping .",
    "it is clear to see that eq .",
    "( [ current2 ] ) shows the movement of the self - dual vortices in spacetime .",
    "so , the total charge of the fqh system can be written as @xmath81 it is obvious to learn that there exist @xmath70 isolated vortices , of which the @xmath75-th vortex possesses charge @xmath82 .",
    "and @xmath83 corresponds to the vortex , while @xmath84 corresponds to the antivortex .",
    "in the above section , we have studied the topological properties of the self - dual vortices in the case that the vector order parameter @xmath1 only consists of regular points , i.e. , @xmath85 is hold true . however ,",
    "when the regular condition fails , branch processes will occur .",
    "usually there are two kinds of branch points , namely the limit points and the bifurcation points . in this section",
    ", we will study the evolution of the self - dual vortices in the fqh system . from eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) , we can learn that the velocity of the @xmath75-th zero point is determined by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the usual jacobian .",
    "it is obvious that when @xmath88 , at the very point @xmath89 the velocity is not unique in the neighborhood of @xmath90 .",
    "if the jacobian @xmath91 , we can use the jacobian @xmath92 instead of @xmath93 for the purpose of using the implicit function theorem @xcite .",
    "then we have a unique solution of eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) in the neighborhood of the very point @xmath94 @xmath95 we call the critical points @xmath94 the limit points . in the present case , we know that @xmath96 then , the taylor expansion of @xmath97 at the limit point @xmath94 is @xmath98 which is a parabola in @xmath99 plane . from eq .",
    "( [ talor ] ) we can obtain two solutions @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which give two branch solutions ( world lines of vortices ) .",
    "if @xmath102 , we have the branch solutions for @xmath103 ; otherwise , we have the branch solutions for @xmath104 [ see fig . [ fig1 ] ] .",
    "these two cases are related to the generation and annihilation of the self - dual vortices .    [ cols= \"",

    "( [ taylor ] ) and ( [ taylor2 ] ) give respectively @xmath105 this case is obvious , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]    these cases reveal the evolution of the self - dual vortices in the fqh system . beside two vortices encounter and then depart at the bifurcation point along different branch curves , it also includes splitting and merging of vortices .",
    "when a multicharged vortex moves through the bifurcation point , it may split into several vortices along different branch curves . on the contrary , several vortices can merge into one vortex at the bifurcation point .",
    "the identical conversation of the topological charges shows the sum of the topological charges of these final vortices must be equal to that of the original vortices at the bifurcation point , i.e. , @xmath106    furthermore , from the above discussion , we can see that the generation , annihilation , and bifurcation of vortices are not gradually changed , but suddenly changed at the critical points .",
    "in conclusion , using the @xmath0-mapping topological current theory , the topological properties of self - dual vortices in the fqh system are studied . in sec .",
    "[ section1 ] , we obtain an exact bogomolnyi self - dual equation with topological term , which is ignored in traditional self - dual equation . it is revealed that there are self - dual vortices in the fqh system and the topological charges are determined by hopf indices and brouwer degrees . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , we point out that the self - dual vortices generate or annihilate at the limit points and encounter , split or merge at the bifurcation . it is shown that the topological charges of the vortices are preserved in the branch processes during the evolution of these self - dual vortices .",
    "at last , it should be pointed out that in the present paper we treat the vortices as mathematical lines , i.e. , the width of a vortex line is zero .",
    "this description is obtained in the approximation that the curvature radius of a vortex line is much larger than the width of the vortex line @xcite .",
    "it is a great pleasure to thank b. h. gong for numerous fruitful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grant no ."
