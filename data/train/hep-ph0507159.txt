    "in recent years , the standard model of electroweak interactions has been confirmed experimentally with outstanding success .",
    "not only was almost all the particle content discovered at accelerator experiments , but their properties and interactions have been measured with high precision , in agreement with the model prediction . the only missing piece is the higgs boson , which is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , even today we can obtain meaningful constraints on the higgs boson mass from electroweak precision measurements . due to the impressive accuracy of some of these experimental results ,",
    "they are sensitive to electroweak radiative corrections at the next - to - leading ( nlo ) and sometimes next - to - next - to - leading ( nnlo ) level , and thus depend on the impact of the higgs boson entering in the loops .",
    "two of the most important quantities in this respect are the mass of the @xmath0 boson , @xmath1 and the sine of the leptonic effective weak mixing angle @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0-boson mass can be inferred from the muon decay constant @xmath3 , which is generated through virtual w - boson exchange , so that @xmath4 .",
    "the effective weak mixing angle , on the other hand , reflects the ratio of the vector and axial - vector couplings , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , of the @xmath7 boson to fermions ( @xmath8 ) at the @xmath7 boson pole : @xmath9 since these couplings can be measured most precisely for leptons , the _ leptonic _ effective weak mixing angle @xmath2is usually taken as a reference .",
    "the current experimental world average for the @xmath0-boson mass is @xmath10 gev @xcite .",
    "recently , a lot of progress has been made towards establishing accurate theoretical prediction for @xmath1 .",
    "the best result @xcite includes the complete two - loop corrections @xcite and some three - loop contributions @xcite .",
    "the remaining theoretical error is estimated to be @xmath11 mev , which is well below the current experimental uncertainty .",
    "still , the electroweak two - loop corrections total to @xmath12 mev and are thus mandatory for electroweak precision analyses .    the effective weak mixing angle @xmath2  is mainly derived from various asymmetries measured around the @xmath7 boson peak at @xmath13 colliders after subtraction of qed effects .",
    "the current experimental accuracy , @xmath14 @xcite implies strong indirect constraints on the allowed range for the higgs boson mass @xmath15 .",
    "therefore it is important to develop precise theoretical calculations for this quantity .",
    "usually , @xmath2  is computed as a function of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath16 , the muon constant @xmath3 and the masses of the @xmath7 boson , @xmath17 , and the top quark , @xmath18 ( other fermion masses are numerically irrelevant ) .",
    "as explained before , @xmath1 is calculated from @xmath3 , but in addition to these corrections , the computation of @xmath2  involves the corrections to the @xmath7 vertex form factors .",
    "the latter are expressed by the quantity @xmath19 , in such a way that the effective weak mixing angle can also be written as : @xmath20 and at tree - level , @xmath21 .",
    "higher - order corrections to @xmath2  have been under extensive theoretical study over the last two decades . besides the one - loop result  @xcite , two- and three - loop qcd corrections are available @xcite , but for the electroweak two - loop contributions only partial results were known . by means of a large mass expansion in the heavy top quark mass , the formally leading @xmath22  @xcite and next - to - leading @xmath23  @xcite terms were computed .",
    "a part of the missing two - loop contributions was incorporated by the complete electroweak two - loop corrections to @xmath1 @xcite . while these corrections effected a shift in @xmath1 of 4 mev compared to the previously known @xmath24 contributions , the induced shift in @xmath2  was very sizable , @xmath25 , thus implying that the missing two - loop terms in the form factor @xmath26 can be of similar order .",
    "as a first step towards completing the electroweak two - loop corrections to @xmath2 , results for the fermionic ( i.e. diagrams with closed fermion loops ) two - loop corrections were presented recently  @xcite .",
    "the genuine two - loop vertex diagrams are represented by the generic topologies in fig .",
    "[ fig : diags ] .",
    "higher - order corrections to the process @xmath27 near the @xmath7 pole can be consistently computed by performing an expansion of the amplitude around the complex pole @xmath28 , @xmath29 = \\frac{r}{s-{\\cal m}_{\\rm z}^2 } + s +       ( s-{\\cal m}_{\\rm z}^2 ) s ' + \\dots \\label{eq : polexp}\\ ] ] here @xmath30 is the @xmath7 decay width . after subtracting contributions from s - channel photon exchange and @xmath31-@xmath7 interference , the vertex corrections form factor at nnlo",
    "is derived to be @xmath32 where the superscripts in parentheses indicate the loop order . in this quantity ,",
    "ir - divergencies from qed contributions drop out , which involves a delicate interplay between one- and two - loop terms in the form factors .",
    "the uv - divergencies are cancelled by on - shell renormalization .",
    "the relevant counterterms are derived using the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the new part of this work is the computation of the two - loop @xmath33 vertex corrections , which are treated with two independent technical methods .",
    "the first method uses large mass expansions for the diagrams with internal top - quark lines and the differential equation method for diagrams with only light fermions @xmath34 , the masses of which are neglected .",
    "contrary to previous work @xcite , the expansion in @xmath35 is performed to high precision , by executing the series to the order @xmath36 , reaching an overall relative precision of @xmath37 of the final result .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion are 2-loop tadpole and 1-loop vertex diagrams , which can be evaluated efficiently with well - known analytical formulae .",
    "the contributions from diagrams without top - quark propagators involve only two independent scales , @xmath17 and @xmath1 , allowing a fully analytical treatment . even for the limited set of diagrams with closed fermions loops ,",
    "a large number of scalar integrals with non - trivial structures in the numerator are involved .",
    "they can be reduced to a set of scalar master integrals by using integration - by - parts identities @xcite . owing to size of the linear equation system associated with this reduction procedure",
    ", the algorithm has been implemented in the dedicated c++ library diagen / idsolver @xcite , which performs the necessary steps in a highly automized way .",
    "analytical results for these master integrals are obtained by the differential equation method @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated by the following example , @xmath38   =     \\frac{p^2}{p^2+m^2 } \\biggl ( \\frac{4-d}{2}(4 + 5 \\frac{m^2}{p^2 } )    \\left [ \\raisebox{-5.4mm}{\\psfig{figure = v2p1.ps , width=1.6cm}}\\;\\right ] + \\frac{10 - 3d}{2 } \\left [ \\raisebox{-5.4mm}{\\psfig{figure = v2p0.ps , width=1.6cm}}\\;\\right ]    - \\frac{2-d}{2 } \\left [ \\raisebox{-3mm}{\\psfig{figure = t134.ps , width=0.95cm}}\\right ]    \\biggr).\\ ] ] here the thick lines represent massive propagators with mass @xmath39 , the thin lines denote massless propagators and @xmath40 is the momentum flowing into the vertex .",
    "@xmath41 is the dimension of dimensional regularization .",
    "the momentum derivate of the scalar integrals on the left - hand side results in the same integral and simpler integral topologies on the right - hand side .",
    "feeding in analytical results for these simpler integrals , the differential equation can be solved in terms of generalized polylogarithms .",
    "all integrals were also checked by using low - momentum expansions .",
    "the second method makes use of numerical integrations based on dispersion relations .",
    "a scalar two - loop integral with a self - energy sub - loop as in fig .  [ fig : disp ]  ( a ) can be expressed as @xcite    ' '' ''    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the discontinuity of the scalar one - loop self - energy function .",
    "the second integral can be evaluated into a standard @xmath44-point one - loop function , leaving the integration over @xmath45 to be performed numerically . in general",
    ", one can also introduce dispersion relations for triangle sub - loops @xcite , but it is often technically easier to reduce them to self - energy sub - loops by introducing feynman parameters @xcite , @xmath46^{-1 } \\ ; [ ( q+p_2)^2-m_2 ^ 2]^{-1 } = \\int_0 ^ 1 { \\rm d}x    \\ ; [ ( q+\\bar{p})^2 - \\overline{m}^2]^{-2 } \\\\",

    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] this is indicated diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ]  ( b ) .",
    "the integration over the feynman parameters is also performed numerically . as a result",
    ", all master integrals for the vertex topologies can be evaluated by at most 3-dim . numerical integrations . before performing the numerical integrations , possible",
    "uv- and ir - divergencies need to be subtracted from the integrals . while this second method is applicable to two - loop vertex corrections with an arbitrary number of mass scales , it is slower and leads to much large expressions than the first method",
    ". nevertheless it provides an important check of the result .",
    "special caution is needed for the diagrams with a fermion triangle loop ( see the third diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : diags ] ) , which involve the @xmath47 matrix . in dimensional regularization , it is not possible to fulfill the two relations @xmath48 and tr@xmath49 simultaneously . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contributions resulting in @xmath50-tensors were therefore evaluated in four dimensions , based on the observation that these terms are free of uv - divergencies .",
    "potential soft and collinear divergencies of single diagrams are regulated using a photon mass , with a subsequent careful expansion for zero photon masses .",
    "the new result for the fermionic two - loop corrections is combined with corrections of order @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xcite , @xmath53 @xcite and leading three - loop terms of @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "reducible terms of the same order are taken into account , but no resummations are preformed .",
    "the most precise prediction of @xmath2  is obtained as a function of the muon decay constant @xmath3 , from which the @xmath0-boson mass is calculated by including the radiative corrections to @xmath1 as given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ fig : res ] shows the final result for @xmath2  as a function of the higgs mass compared to the current experimental value .",
    "included in the plot are the error bands due to the uncertainties of the experimental input parameters entering into the theoretical prediction and of the direct measurement of @xmath2 . as evident from the figure , the identification of computation and measurement for @xmath2  favor relatively small values for @xmath15 . with the new two - loop corrections , the best - fit value for @xmath15 moved from 148 gev ( using formulae of ref .",

    "@xcite as a parametric fitting formula that is accurate in the range 10 gev @xmath57 1 tev .",
    "it has also been implemented into the newest version 6.42 of the program zfitter @xcite , with some changes recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was used in the latest release of electroweak precision global fits of the standard model .",
    "the impact of the new result for @xmath2  shifts the 95% confidence level upper bound on the higgs mass upwards by 23 gev to 260 gev @xcite .",
    "together with the inclusion of the new two - loop result in the prediction for @xmath2 , a assessment of the uncertainties from missing higher order contributions is required . since for practical purposes",
    "@xmath2  is given as a function of the muon decay constant @xmath3 , it is useful to evaluate the theoretical error for this parametrization , i.e. combining the radiative corrections to @xmath1 and the @xmath7 vertex .",
    "a simple method to estimate the higher order uncertainties assumes that the perturbation series follows roughly a geometric progression .",
    "this presumption implies relations like @xmath58 with this method one obtains the following errors for @xmath15 between 10 and 1000 gev in units of @xmath59 : between 2.3 and 2.0 for the @xmath60 contributions beyond the leading @xmath61 term , between 1.8 and 2.5 for @xmath62 , between 1.1 and 1.0 for @xmath63 and between 1.7 and 2.4 for @xmath64 .",
    "the missing bosonic @xmath65 corrections can not be appraised from geometric progression . however , considering they have a prefactor @xmath66 but no specific enhancement factor , they are estimated to be about @xmath67 . to account for possible deviations from the geometric series behavior , an overall factor",
    "@xmath68 was included to arrive at a total error of @xmath69 .",
    "alternatively , the error from a higher - order qcd loop can be assessed by varying the scale of the strong coupling constant @xmath70 or the top - quark mass @xmath18 in the @xmath71 scheme in the highest available perturbation order .",
    "the scale variation leads to an error estimate of 0.1 to @xmath72 for the @xmath73 corrections and of less than @xmath74 for the @xmath75 contributions .",
    "these numbers are of the same order as the estimated errors from the geometric progression method , so that the total error given above seems to be fairly reliable .",
    "the new error estimate was used in the latest electroweak global fits @xcite and lead to a reduction of the width of the well - known _ blue band _ , which indicates the theoretical error in the indirect determination of the higgs mass .",
    "in this contribution , recent progress in the calculation of higher - order corrections to the most important electroweak precision observables and their impact on the indirect determination of the higgs mass was reported .",
    "the complete fermionic @xmath76 corrections to the leptonic effective weak mixing angle @xmath2  have been calculated and numerical results were presented . as an additional check ,",
    "the computation of the two - loop vertex integrals was performed with two independent methods .",
    "the new result , together with an estimate of the remaining theoretical error , was included in the latest version of the program zfitter and used for the latest global electroweak fits of the standard model .",
    "the calculation of the remaining bosonic electroweak two - loop corrections is currently in progress and will be available soon @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we are working on adapting the new results for quark final states , where particular attention has to be paid to the @xmath77 vertex , since it includes additional massive top - quark propagators @xcite .",
