    "quantum entanglement has many applications including quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , and quantum communication @xcite .",
    "this has led people to regard entanglement as a resource .",
    "however , entanglement can exist in different forms and so it is useful to know how it can be manipulated from one form to another . in this paper",
    "the problem of manipulating a general pure two - particle entangled state in order to obtain maximally entangled states will be considered .",
    "we will also consider the problem of how to manipulate one general pure two - particle entangled state to another .",
    "alice and bob are allowed to do whatever they want locally and they are allowed to communicate classically with one another .",
    "they are not allowed to exchange quantum states .",
    "this type of situation has already been much discussed in the literature .",
    "the problem of how to optimally manipulate a large number , @xmath4 , of copies of a general pure two - particle entangled states into maximally entangled states by local means has been completely solved in the asymptotic limit @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , the perhaps more basic problem of how to manipulate a single copy of a general pure two - particle state into maximally entangled states has not been so extensively discussed .",
    "the most significant work on this is by lo and popescu @xcite who prove certain bounds relating to this problem .",
    "however their proofs , while being extraordinarily ingenious , are rather difficult to follow .",
    "the method developed in this paper , which completely solves the problem , involves the cutting and pasting of areas along with a colouring problem .",
    "once the basic methods have been put in place , it is very easy to picture what is happening .",
    "this method is used to find the maximum obtainable average entanglement and to derive a formula of lo and popescu which gives the maximum probability of obtaining a given maximally entangled state .",
    "a related problem is how to transform one pure two - particle entangled state to another , and to establish which states will transform to one another in this way .",
    "nielsen @xcite has completely solved this problem .",
    "however his proof of his theorem uses some unfamiliar mathematics .",
    "an alternative reasonably simple proof of nielsen s theorem is given here which , again , involves cutting and pasting of areas along with a certain colouring problem .",
    "the most general pure two - particle state can be written in the schmidt form @xmath6 and where the states @xmath7 are orthonormal .",
    "we want to manipulate this state in order to obtain states which are of the form @xmath8-state .",
    "an @xmath9-state is equivalent to @xmath10 copies of 2-states @xcite . after the process",
    "is completed we should have a certain @xmath9-state with a certain probability @xmath1 .",
    "particle a goes to alice and particle b goes to bob .",
    "alice and bob are allowed to perform whatever operations they want locally and also they communicate classically with each other .",
    "this can happen in the following way .",
    "alice performs a measurement and communicates the result to bob who then performs a measurement which depends on the result of alice s measurement , and then bob communicates his result back to alice and she makes another measurement , and so on back and forth .",
    "this is most general way in which alice and bob can manipulate their state without actually exchanging quantum states in the process .",
    "whatever measure of entanglement we employ , the amount of entanglement should not increase during such a process .",
    "lo and popescu show that , for the very special case of a two - particle pure state , this process is equivalent to one in which alice makes one measurement and communicates the result to bob who then may perform a unitary evolution operation on his particles .",
    "the reason for this significant simplification is that , due to the schmidt decomposition , any operation by bob is equivalent , so far as the resulting form of the state is concerned , to some operation by alice .",
    "hence , alice can simply do everything herself in one go and then communicate the final result to bob .",
    "the most general measurement alice can make is a povm .",
    "this is equivalent to alice introducing an ancilla , @xmath11 , performing a general unitary evolution on particle @xmath12 and the ancilla @xmath11 , and then making a projective measurement on the ancilla .",
    "let us imagine that the ancilla has a basis set of states @xmath13 . since we allow completely general evolution of @xmath14 we can assume , without loss of generality , that the final measurement projects onto subspaces spanned by the states @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , it is shown in the appendix that there is no advantage to be had by performing a non - maximal ( i.e. degenerate ) measurement and so we can assume that this measurement is maximal and projects onto the operators @xmath15 .",
    "for each outcome , @xmath16 , the two particles @xmath12 and @xmath17 should be projected into an @xmath9-state @xmath18 where @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "after alice has communicated the result , @xmath16 , of the measurement to bob , bob could rotate these vectors into the same standard form for all @xmath16 ( thus removing the need for the superscript at this stage ) , but this is not important .",
    "it is enough that alice and bob know what @xmath16 is so they know what state they have .",
    "we do not require a superscript @xmath16 on the @xmath21 states since , as explained below , alice can rotate her schmidt vectors to standard form as part of the overall unitary transformation she performs . just before alice makes her measurement projecting onto @xmath13 the state of the system will be @xmath22 can be taken to be real since any phases can be absorbed into appropriately redefined @xmath13 . note that if , at this stage , the @xmath23 states had a superscript @xmath16 then they could be rotated into standard form by applying a series of controlled unitary operations , @xmath24 , to @xmath12 where the control is the @xmath13 state . at this stage alice",
    "has not done anything which is irreversible . having completed her local manipulations alice will perform a maximal projective measurement .",
    "it follows from the result of lo and popescu that manipulating the state into the form ( [ targeta ] ) and then measuring onto the @xmath13 basis is equivalent to the most general procedure for manipulating the two particles by local means to @xmath9-states .",
    "we will use equation ( [ targeta ] ) later when we come to show that the method developed in the next section is equivalent to the most general method .      now consider the initial state @xmath2 given in equation ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "we will introduce an ancilla , @xmath25 , in the state @xmath26 .",
    "this ancilla has basis states @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "we will take @xmath4 to be very large and will want to consider the case where @xmath4 tends to infinity .",
    "we define the integers @xmath29 where , for the moment , we are taking the @xmath30 to be rational numbers so the integers @xmath31 can be found with @xmath4 finite .",
    "this constraint can be relaxed when @xmath4 tends to infinity .",
    "the initial state of @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "alice now evolves @xmath34 using the following transformations . @xmath35 the fact that these transformations evolve orthogonal states to orthogonal states ensures that they can be implemented by unitary evolution . under these transformations",
    "the state @xmath33 evolves to latexmath:[\\[\\label{eqamp }     state_. we see that each of the @xmath4 terms in this superposition has the same amplitude .",
    "each of these terms will be represented by a rectangular element width 1 and height @xmath37 .",
    "the area of the element is @xmath37 and equal to the probability associated with the corresponding term in ( [ eqamp ] ) .",
    "each element can be labelled by @xmath38 corresponding to the term @xmath39 ( initially @xmath40 but after alice has performed operations on her particles this will not necessarily be the case for every term ) .",
    "the elements are then arranged on a graph where elements having the same @xmath41 are placed in the same row and elements having the same @xmath42 are placed in the same column .",
    "the resulting graph looks like a series of steps as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    we will call this the _ area diagram_. the total area under the steps is 1 corresponding to the total probability . on the vertical axis @xmath43 is plotted . on the horizontal axis the @xmath42 which appears in @xmath23 is plotted . for small @xmath41 every @xmath42 position will be filled .",
    "however , because of the form of the state ( [ eqamp ] ) , once @xmath41 gets bigger than @xmath44 there will no longer be any @xmath45 terms .",
    "this is the reason for the step at @xmath46 .",
    "there will be further steps at each @xmath47 .",
    "the height of the rightmost step is @xmath48 .",
    "subsequent steps will be at heights @xmath30 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . if a projective measurement were to be performed on @xmath25 at this stage then , corresponding to each outcome @xmath41 , the state of @xmath49 would be projected onto an @xmath9-state where @xmath9 is equal to the number of elements in the @xmath41th row on the area diagram .",
    "this will give a distribution of @xmath9-states with probabilities which are equal to the large horizontal rectangular areas of width @xmath9 and height @xmath50 formed by extending the horizontal parts of the step back to the vertical axis .",
    "however , the area in the diagram can be moved around by alice in a way to be described below by performing local unitary operations . when this is followed by a projective measurement on @xmath25 different distributions of @xmath9-states",
    "can be realised .",
    "the terms @xmath39 and @xmath51 are bi - orthogonal iff @xmath52 ( orthogonal at alice s end ) and @xmath53 ( orthogonal at bob s end ) .",
    "if two terms are only orthogonal at either alice s end or at bob s end then they are mono - orthogonal . in the area diagram",
    "we will impose the constraint that all elements in a row , that is for a given @xmath41 , correspond to terms which are bi - orthogonal .",
    "this ensures that when we perform a projective measurement onto @xmath25 the resulting state will be an @xmath9-state .",
    "we will colour all the elements which correspond to terms which are mono - orthogonal to one another a given colour .",
    "elements corresponding to terms which are bi - orthogonal will be coloured with different colours .",
    "thus , initially , all the elements in a given column are the same colour and every column is coloured a different colour to every other column . when area is moved around the constraint that terms corresponding to elements in a row be bi - orthogonal means that all elements in any given row must be different colours .",
    "the method of areas to be developed here involves moving area elements around in such a way that there is a net movement of area up and to the left .",
    "we will see that it is possible to have a net movement of area up the area diagram but not down the diagram .",
    "this means that the net movement of area across any horizontal line drawn on the diagram must be up .",
    "the basic unitary operation , @xmath54 , employed by alice is defined by the transformation equations @xmath55 @xmath56 with no change for all other @xmath57 .",
    "we will call this the swap operation .",
    "the effect of this operation is to move elements around on the area diagram .",
    "if there are elements at both the @xmath38 and @xmath58 positions then they will have their positions swapped .",
    "if , there is only an element at one of the two positions then it will be moved to the other position while the original position will become vacant .",
    "these moves will not effect bob s part of the state .",
    "if two terms are bi-(mono)-orthogonal before the swap operation is applied to one or both of them then they will be bi-(mono)-orthogonal afterwards . in other words ,",
    "the swap operation does not change the colour of the elements .",
    "initially , as stated above , all elements in the same row are different colours and elements in the same column are the same colour .",
    "in moving elements of area around we impose only the constraint that , at the end of the process , all elements in a row are different colours .",
    "although elements in any given column start off being the same colour , we do not demand that this is true at the end of the process .",
    "we can move a large number of elements at once . in the limit as @xmath59",
    "the elements will become infinitesimal in height .",
    "hence , in this limit , we can make horizontal cuts anywhere .",
    "we can make vertical cuts along the edges of the columns .",
    "the area can be cut up into smaller pieces and then pieces can be moved around and pasted into new positions .",
    "it is possible to move area around like this in any way we want by repeated applications of the swap operation .",
    "the empty space above the steps can be used as a clipboard for the temporary storage of pieces of area to facilitate the rearrangement of area if required .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the original step structure is shown by a full line .",
    "a new step structure is shown by a dashed line .",
    "we will impose the constraint ( to be justified later ) that the new step structure consists of steps which , like the original steps , go across and down ( but never up ) towards the right .",
    "the area @xmath60 which will be cut away from some parts of the steps is equal to the area @xmath61 which will be added to other parts of the steps .",
    "each of these areas consist of @xmath25 smaller disjoint parts labelled by @xmath62 going up the diagram .",
    "note , area @xmath63 lies between area @xmath64 an @xmath65 .",
    "note also that the areas @xmath64 and @xmath63 can themselves be made up of disjoint parts .",
    "the constraint that there is no net movement of area downwards means that @xmath66 for all @xmath67 .",
    "the original steps are of height @xmath30 .",
    "let the new steps be of height @xmath68 .",
    "since the columns are of unit width , these lengths are numerically equal to the areas of the columns , and hence the constraint that area is moved only to the left is equivalent to the set of constraints @xmath69 for all @xmath70 to @xmath71 with equality holding when @xmath70 .",
    "we could simply move the area @xmath11 to the area @xmath72 element by element by applying the swap operator .",
    "however , if we did this it is likely that elements corresponding to mono - orthogonal terms would end up in the same row . if we can redistribute the area so that it corresponds to the new step structure but without there being any elements of the same colour in the same row then we will have realised another distribution of @xmath9-states",
    "this is because alice could then perform a projective measurement on @xmath25 and corresponding to each outcome , @xmath41 , will be a @xmath9-state and these @xmath9-states will clearly have a different distribution .",
    "the probability of a given @xmath9 state is equal to the area of the horizontal rectangle formed by projecting leftwards the top and bottom of the step at position @xmath9 .",
    "this rectangle has width @xmath9 and height @xmath73 .",
    "hence , for the new area diagram , the probability of getting an @xmath9 state is @xmath74 we will show firstly that this colouring problem can be solved and secondly that the process described here is general in the sense that any distribution of @xmath9-states which can be achieved by local means can be achieved by this method .",
    "hence , equations ( [ newsteps ] ) and ( [ psubm ] ) define the possible distributions of @xmath9-states that can be obtained .",
    "the solution to the colouring problem will be explained by reference to the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "this example has @xmath75 ( since all of @xmath72 is above all of @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , it will be clear that the method works for the general case .",
    "we start by taking the rightmost column in the area @xmath11 .",
    "this is area @xmath12 in fig [ fig4](a ) .",
    "this area is then swapped into the rightmost column of the area @xmath72",
    "so that point @xmath76 coincides with point @xmath77 as shown in fig . [",
    "fig4](b ) .",
    "however , it may be too long to all fit in to the right most column of area @xmath72 ( as is indeed the case in our example ) , and hence it will displace some of the area in the column below this , marked as area @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "because of the nature of the swapping operation , this area @xmath17 will be moved to the old position of @xmath12 so that point @xmath78 coincides with point @xmath79 as shown in fig . [ fig4](b ) .",
    "area @xmath12 is now in its final position .",
    "let us imagine that the column from which area @xmath12 was taken was coloured red .",
    "this red colour will now be divided between what is left of the original column and the area @xmath12 in its new position . since the steps go up towards the left , it is impossible to have red at more than one position in any given row .",
    "the rightmost column of @xmath72 is now filled so we start on the next rightmost column .",
    "we swap area @xmath17 into position in the next rightmost column of area @xmath72 . again",
    ", this could be too long . in our example",
    "it is too long and projects into the column below into the area marked @xmath80 .",
    "hence @xmath80 will be moved to where @xmath17 was .",
    "this takes us to the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) .",
    "now we move area @xmath80 into position in the next rightmost column of area @xmath72",
    ". this could again be too long and project into the column below , but in this example this is not the case .",
    "rather , area @xmath80 is too short leaving a gap .",
    "hence no area is moved back to the rightmost column of @xmath11 and this means we have finally dispensed with the net effect of moving the area from this rightmost column of @xmath11 .",
    "now we select the next rightmost column of @xmath11 . in our example",
    "this area is marked @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) .",
    "this area is now moved up following the same procedure .",
    "thus , we move @xmath81 into position as high as possible in the rightmost column of @xmath72 which has not yet been filled .",
    "this places it below area @xmath80",
    ". it could be the case that @xmath80 is too long and projects into the column below in which case some area would be swapped back and we would have to continue as before .",
    "however , in our particular example area @xmath81 fits in below @xmath80 and the recolouring is finally completed as shown in fig . [ fig4](d ) .",
    "this method can be applied to any recolouring problem of this nature .",
    "the general method is that area is swapped from the rightmost non - empty column of @xmath11 to as high a position as possible in the rightmost non - full column of @xmath72 .",
    "we note that a given colour can end up in , at most , two different columns and that any colour moved from a column will always end up higher than its original position .",
    "this means that it is impossible for two elements of area which started in the same column ( having the same colour ) to end up in the same row .",
    "hence , the colouring problem has been solved .",
    "having shown that it is possible to have a net movement of area up the area diagram in any general way which is consistent with maintaining the step structure , we will now show that this corresponds to the most general way of manipulating entanglement to produce @xmath9-states in the sense that any distribution of @xmath9-states which can be achieved by local operations classical communication can be achieved by this method .",
    "the idea of this proof will be to show that the target state ( just before alice measures on to the ancilla ) can be put into a certain form which is inconsistent with any movement of area downwards .",
    "we have already established that the most general final state just before alice makes her measurement ( we call this the _ target state _ ) is the state given in ( [ targeta ] ) .",
    "if we write @xmath82 then ( [ targeta ] ) becomes @xmath83 we can consider further unitary transformations by alice on this state to put it into a form in which every term has the same amplitude . let the dimension of the ancilla @xmath11 be @xmath84 and define @xmath85 ( again we will let @xmath86 ) and let alice perform the following transformations on ( [ targeta ] ) : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the set of @xmath89 integers from @xmath90 to @xmath91 ( we put @xmath92 ) . under this transformation ( [ targeta ] ) becomes @xmath93 every term in this state has the same amplitude . in arriving at this state from the previous target state ( [ targeta],[targetap ] )",
    "we have done nothing that is irreversible .",
    "furthermore , if we measure onto the @xmath94 basis we are just as likely to get a given @xmath9-state as with the previous target state .",
    "hence , we can regard this as our new target state .",
    "any method by which @xmath9-states can be obtained is equivalent to manipulating the state into the form ( [ targetb ] ) .",
    "if we project onto @xmath94 we will obtain an @xmath95-state where @xmath95 can be read off from ( [ targetb ] ) .",
    "we can relabel the @xmath41 s such that @xmath96 .",
    "thus , we can impose the following :    constraint a : :    if outcome @xmath41 corresponds to a @xmath95-state    then , without loss of generality , we can impose the constraint that    @xmath96 .    by examining ( [ targetb ] )",
    "we can see that there is a second constraint that can be imposed on the form of the final target state .",
    "constraint b : :    for the target state we can , without any loss of generality , impose    the constraint that @xmath97    where @xmath98 is any normalised state for    system @xmath17 since this is true of equation ( [ targetb ] ) .",
    "we can identify the ancilla @xmath11 with the ancilla @xmath25 introduced earlier .",
    "hence , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "now consider the state ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "since alice s operations do not effect bob s system we see that we have the following constraint :    constraint c : :    while the state @xmath101 is being manipulated by    local unitary operations by alice , we will always have    @xmath102 for all    @xmath103 .",
    "since ( [ eqamp ] ) is related to ( [ psi ] ) by reversible operations , we can take ( [ eqamp ] ) , which corresponds to an area diagram , as our starting point .",
    "we will now see that area can not be moved down in the area diagram . for the purposes of this proof consider a change in the way the area diagram is plotted such that the @xmath103 in @xmath104 ( rather than the @xmath42 in @xmath23 ) is plotted on the horizontal axis .",
    "this will simply have the effect of redistributing elements horizontally but not vertically since @xmath43 is still plotted on the vertical axis .",
    "we label elements in this modified area diagram by @xmath105 .",
    "constraint c implies that the column corresponding to a given @xmath103 on this modified area diagram will always have the same area .",
    "this is because alice s actions can not effect the total area ( or probability ) associated with column @xmath103 .",
    "however , alice can change the @xmath41 value associated with area elements and hence she can move area in column @xmath103 up and down .",
    "it is possible that she can bring about a net movement of area ( or probability ) down in this column .",
    "this would lead to the area being compressed into a smaller space than it would naturally  fit .",
    "any net movement of area downwards , whether on the @xmath105 picture or the @xmath38 picture would correspond to this happening in at least one @xmath103 column .",
    "this is exactly what we want to rule out .",
    "we will now see that any such net movement downwards will violate constraint @xmath17 ( which we were free to impose on the target state ) .",
    "if , at some stage , the state has been manipulated to the state @xmath101 then the area of the @xmath105 element will be @xmath106 .",
    "initially , for the start state @xmath107 in ( [ eqamp ] ) , we have @xmath108 for all @xmath109 . however , if there is a net movement of area down the area diagram with respect to the horizontal line @xmath110 then , since the total area in a given column is constant ( by constraint c ) , this net movement of area downwards must happen in at least one column of the modified area diagram .",
    "hence , for at least one value of @xmath103 , we must have @xmath111 however , since @xmath100 , equation ( [ conb ] ) implies @xmath112 the contradiction between ( [ areabig ] ) and ( [ areasmall ] ) proves that a net movement of area downwards is not possible on the modified area diagram and hence neither is it possible on the unmodified area diagram .",
    "note that this proof goes through for any sort of operations by alice and in particular it does not assume that the only operations alice can make are the swap operations defined in ( [ swap ] ) .    to complete the proof that the manipulations described earlier are equivalent to the most general way of manipulating the state to obtain @xmath9-states we note the following .",
    "\\(i ) the target state ( [ targetb ] ) can be represented on an area diagram in which @xmath43 ( where @xmath113 ) is on the vertical axis and @xmath95 is plotted on the horizontal axis .",
    "since @xmath95 is an integer and since we can impose constraint a without loss of generality , this area diagram will have a step structure ( in which the steps of integer width go down towards the right ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the initial state can be taken to be the start state @xmath107 given in ( [ eqamp ] ) and this can be represented by an area diagram with the step structure .",
    "\\(iii ) the total area of both these diagrams is 1 .",
    "therefore the most general way of manipulating the start state into @xmath9-states corresponds to going from one area diagram with the step structure to another with the step structure in a way consistent with the constraint that there is no net movement of area downwards .",
    "\\(iv ) the method , employing the swap operator , discussed previously can be used to go from one step structure to another in any way that is consistent with there being no net downward movement of area .",
    "hence , it is equivalent to the most general method .",
    "if we are only interested in the average amount of entanglement in the form of maximally entangled states we can obtain , this being equal to @xmath114 , then it turns out that any movement of area will decrease this average .",
    "hence this average has a maximum given by the original area diagram @xmath115 to see that any movement of area will decrease this average , consider moving one element on the area diagram ( with area equal to @xmath116 ) from the end of row @xmath12 which has original width @xmath117 , to the end of row @xmath17 which has original width @xmath118 .",
    "since we can only move area to the left we require that @xmath119 ( if @xmath120 then the rows will simply have interchanged their lengths and hence there will be no change in the distribution of @xmath9-states ) .",
    "the original contribution of these two rows to @xmath121 will be @xmath122 the contribution afterwards will be @xmath123 the difference between these two contributions is @xmath124\\ ] ] it can only be advantageous to move elements of area if this quantity is positive .",
    "however , by making the substitutions @xmath125 we can see that @xmath126 is negative if @xmath127 .",
    "the constraint that @xmath128 implies that @xmath129 and hence any movement of area must lead to a smaller @xmath121 .",
    "we also see from this that since only one distribution of @xmath9-states leads to the maximum @xmath121 , any attempt to alter the distribution of @xmath9-states will result in a decrease of @xmath121 ( and so we obtain another main result of lo and popescu ) .",
    "we will now use this method to derive a formula central to the paper of lo and popescu @xcite .",
    "imagine that we have a general two - particle pure entangled state and we want to have a given @xmath9-state with as high a probability as possible .",
    "we want to know what this probability is and what strategy to use .",
    "this corresponds to the area redistribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the target area diagram consists of a block of width @xmath9 with an additional bit on top .",
    "this defines @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( see diagram ) .",
    "the area @xmath11 has been moved to the area @xmath72 where these two areas are equal .",
    "the height of the main block is @xmath131 which can be calculated since we know that @xmath132 where the last equality follows from the fact that the @xmath42th column is of area @xmath30 .",
    "the total probability of getting the @xmath9-state is equal to the area of the main block , i.e. @xmath133 .",

    "however , we can not immediately interpret the new area diagram as being equivalent to a @xmath3 state since , unlike in the original area diagram , a given column can be multicoloured .",
    "we will see that , nevertheless , we can use the area diagrams to prove nielsen s theorem .",
    "this proof works along similar lines to the previous proof .",

    "if we project it onto @xmath94 then we will get a state with , say , @xmath95 terms ( where @xmath95 can be read off from ( [ nbtarget ] ) ) not all of which are bi - orthogonal .",
    "we can relabel the @xmath41 s so that @xmath157 and hence we can draw an area diagram with a step structure .",
    "the terms corresponding to a given @xmath41 are not necessarily bi - orthogonal and hence we can not impose on the target area diagram the constraint that elements in a row must all be coloured different colours .",

    ".      the start state is @xmath107 in ( [ eqamp ] ) and is represented by an area diagram with step structure in which each column is coloured with only one colour , this being different to the colour of the other columns .",
    "the target area diagram is shown in fig .",
    "since this has been recoloured the columns in this diagram will not necessarily be of one colour .",
    "the height of the @xmath42th column is @xmath158 .",

    "some of the pieces @xmath163 $ ] are likely to have these boundaries on them . however , as @xmath164 the total area of such pieces will tend to zero and we can assume that each piece has a unique colour . the idea will be to collect all the pieces with a given @xmath162 .",

    ", this means we require that all the pieces labelled with the same @xmath162 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] should be of different colour .",
    "thus , we have another colouring problem . if we can solve this colouring problem under the assumption that net movement of area is up , then we will have given a constructive proof that nielsen s bound can be obtained . to complete the proof of nielsen s theorem",
    "we need to show that area can only be moved up .",
    "this will be done later .    a way to solve this colouring problem",
    "was suggested to the author by a. mahtani .",
    "this solution is obtained simply by correcting the solution to the previous colouring problem in sec .",
    "2.2 @xcite firstly , this colouring procedure , illustrated by example in fig . [ fig4 ] , is used to go from the start area diagram ( representing @xmath2 ) to the target diagram where the heights of the columns are @xmath68 .",
    "now we note that it is a property of this recolouring procedure that a given colour can end up in two columns at most .",
    "there are two ways in which a piece of area can be moved to the left .",
    "either it can be moved directly ( as are the pieces @xmath12 and @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , or it can first be swapped to the right and then be moved back to a further left position than it started in ( as are pieces @xmath17 and @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we will call the first type _ directly swapped _ pieces and the second type of pieces the _ swapped back _ pieces . since these swapped back pieces ( for example , piece @xmath17 )",
    "must be shorter than the piece that displaced them from their original column ( in the case of @xmath17 this was piece @xmath12 ) , since they always end up at the top of their destination column , and since the column they end up in is higher than their starting column , they must occupy proportionally less of their final column than the pieces that displaced them ( piece @xmath17 occupies proportionally less of its final column than piece @xmath12 of its final column ) .",
    "this means that when the columns are divided up into a large number , @xmath159 , of equal pieces the colours of the swapped back pieces will not appear in two pieces with the same @xmath162 .",
    "hence , we will first correct the other colours .",
    "however , the procedure which corrects the colours of the directly swapped pieces disturbs this property of the swapped back pieces . hence , after correcting for a bunch of directly swapped pieces , we will have to correct for the swapped back pieces as well .",
    "first we will consider the colours corresponding to the directly swapped pieces . before we do that",
    "note that some columns will remain unchanged ( neither have area moved into them , or out of them ) and hence their colour can not end up in two pieces with the same @xmath162 .",
    "these columns can be completely ignored and we can consider only the remaining columns .",
    "we start at the rightmost column and go left considering only the columns which have changed .",
    "the first changed columns we meet will be shorter than originally , will each be coloured with only one colour , and will have had some area swapped out of them directly .",
    "after one or more of these monochromatic columns , we will meet a column into which these directly swapped pieces have been moved .",
    "the last directly swapped piece may displace a piece from this column which will be a swapped back piece @xmath11 .",
    "this piece , when it is swapped back , will end up at a column , @xmath175 , somewhere to the left .",
    "but before we get there , we may meet a few more monochromatic columns , @xmath176 , from which pieces @xmath177 have been directly swapped .",
    "we will count @xmath178 backwards so first we meet @xmath179 as we go leftwards .",
    "eventually , on our journey leftwards , we meet column @xmath175 into which @xmath11 has been swapped , then pieces @xmath180 to @xmath181 . when the last piece @xmath181 is swapped into position it may displace piece @xmath182 which will be swapped back .",
    "thus , we will repeat the same story as we continue leftwards .",
    "columns will come in bunches of a few monochromatic columns ( such as @xmath176 ) followed by a multicoloured column ( like @xmath175 ) .",
    "the columns @xmath175 and @xmath176 are shown in fig . [ fig7](a ) for the case @xmath183 .",
    "columns not relevant to the present discussion are not shown .",
    "we label the original colour of @xmath175 as @xmath184 and the colour of @xmath176 as @xmath185 .",
    "various distances ( which are numerically equal to areas since the columns are of unit width ) are marked on the figure .",
    "the strategy we will adopt is the following .",
    "we note that , as things stand , the colour @xmath185 in all of @xmath176 also appears in @xmath175 and hence , there must be some of the same colour in different columns for the same @xmath162 . to correct this , we can swap an area , @xmath186 , of colour @xmath184 from @xmath175 into @xmath176 thus swapping the same area , @xmath186 , of @xmath185 back into @xmath175 .",
    "we do this for all @xmath187 .",
    "we then re - sort column @xmath175 so that @xmath186 lies immediately below @xmath177 , both these areas being of the same colour @xmath185 and so that colour @xmath188 is above colour @xmath189 , etc .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) ( the role of area @xmath190 will be explained later ) .",
    "we choose @xmath191 to be such that the proportion of @xmath185 in @xmath175 relative to the height of @xmath175 is equal to the proportion of @xmath184 in @xmath176 relative to the height of @xmath176 .",
    "this condition can be expressed as @xmath192 furthermore , the area @xmath186 of colour @xmath184 is placed in @xmath176 at the same relative position of @xmath176 as the area @xmath193 of colour @xmath185 has been placed in column @xmath175 ( see fig . [",

    "having carried out this correcting procedure for these columns we see that there is a problem .",
    "piece @xmath182 which has been swapped back somewhere to the left of @xmath175 is of colour @xmath184 .",

    "we can see @xmath182 will not also overlap with the pieces @xmath198 ( also of colour @xmath184 ) in columns @xmath199 for the following reasons : ( 1 ) it is smaller than @xmath181 and hence can only partly overlap with the piece @xmath200 ( of colour @xmath188 ) in column @xmath175 in fig .",

    "let us assume that piece @xmath182 is in column @xmath202 and that the original colour of column @xmath202 is @xmath203 .",
    "we can use colour @xmath203 to correct for piece @xmath182 in @xmath202 and @xmath196 in @xmath197 by essentially the same correcting procedure as before .",
    "thus , we swap a piece of @xmath203 and of area @xmath204 from @xmath202 to into @xmath196 in @xmath197 and at the same time swap a piece of colour @xmath184 and of area @xmath204 from @xmath196 in @xmath197 into @xmath202 . the areas @xmath182 and @xmath204 are collected together at the top of column @xmath175 .",
    "the size of area @xmath204 is chosen to be just such that @xmath205 ( which is of colour @xmath184 ) no longer overlaps with any of the colour @xmath184 in @xmath197 .",

    "hence , @xmath207    this correcting procedure is carried out in the following way .",
    "first the rightmost bunch of columns like @xmath176 and @xmath175 are selected .",
    "then the directly swapped pieces are corrected .",
    "and then the swapped back pieces are corrected .",
    "then the next bunch of columns are subject to the same correcting protocol until all the bunches have been corrected .",

    ". the only possible problem would be if we had to swap more of the colour @xmath184 from @xmath175 than there is in the column .",
    "however , we can show that this will not happen . from the fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) we see that the area , @xmath208 , of the original colour @xmath184 in @xmath175 satisfies @xmath209 the inequality must be satisfied since otherwise elements of colour @xmath188 in row @xmath175 will be in the same row as elements of colour @xmath188 in row @xmath197 but we proved in sec .",
    "b. that this could not happen with this colouring of the diagram . from ( [ props],[higher ] )",

    "@xmath11 will require an area @xmath190 of colour @xmath184 to be swapped into a column @xmath211 somewhere on the right .",
    "by analogy with ( [ wpmax ] ) we have @xmath212 where the second inequality follows since @xmath213 .",
    "hence , @xmath214 which means that there is enough of the colour @xmath184 in column @xmath175 to complete this colouring strategy .",
    "hence , the colouring problem has been solved .",
    "we need to prove that nielsen s bound can not be beaten .",
    "this is equivalent to proving that it is not possible to have net movement of area down the area diagram .",
    "the start state corresponds to a step structure .",
    "each column in this can be divided up into @xmath159 pieces as shown in fig .",
    "next we collect together all the pieces corresponding to a given @xmath162 and place them in order along the @xmath42 axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "thus , going along the @xmath42 axis we have the @xmath215 pieces , then the @xmath216 pieces and so on .",
    "this can be accomplished by alice performing swap operations .",
    "we will call this the _ mini - step form _ for the area diagram .",
    "( we are , of course , assuming that system @xmath12 has a large enough hilbert space to be able to do this .",
    "if this is not the case then an additional ancilla could be introduced to effectively increase the size of @xmath12 s hilbert space . )",

    "if this transformation is applied to all terms then the resulting area diagram will consist of a series of mini - steps lined up vertically as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .    next , alice applies swap operations to move these sets of mini - steps so that they are lined up along the @xmath42 axis starting with the @xmath215 pieces giving an area diagram in mini - step form ( like in fig .",
