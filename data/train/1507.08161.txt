    "this paper builds on two recent discoveries in the noncommutative geometry approach to particle physics : we showed in @xcite how to obtain inner fluctuations of the metric without having to assume the order one condition on the dirac operator .",
    "moreover the original argument by classification @xcite of finite geometries @xmath0 that can provide the fine structure of euclidean space - time as a product @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is a usual @xmath3-dimensional riemannian space ) has now been replaced by a much stronger uniqueness statement @xcite .",
    "this new result shows that the algebra @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the quaternions , appears uniquely when writing the higher analogue of the heisenberg commutation relations .",
    "this analogue is written in terms of the basic ingredients of noncommutative geometry where one takes a spectral point of view , encoding geometry in terms of operators on a hilbert space @xmath6 . in this way",
    ", the inverse line element is an unbounded self - adjoint operator @xmath7 .",
    "the operator @xmath7 is the tensor sum of the usual dirac operator on @xmath2 and a ` finite dirac operator ' on @xmath0 , which is simply a hermitian matrix @xmath8 .",
    "the usual dirac operator involves @xmath9 matrices which allow one to combine the momenta into a single operator .",
    "the higher analogue of the heisenberg relations puts the spatial variables on similar footing by combining them into a single operator @xmath10 using another set of @xmath9 matrices and it is in this process that the algebra appears canonically and uniquely in dimension @xmath3 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed account .",
    "what matters for the present paper is that the above process leads without arbitrariness to the pati ",
    "salam @xcite gauge group @xmath11 , together with the corresponding gauge fields and a scalar sector , all derived as inner perturbations of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "note that the scalar sector can not be chosen freely , in contrast to the early work on pati ",
    "salam unification @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are only a few possibilities for the precise scalar content , depending on the assumptions made on the finite dirac operator .    from the spectral action principle ,",
    "the dynamics and interactions are described by the _ spectral action _",
    "@xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a cutoff scale and @xmath14 an even and positive function . in the present case , it can be expanded using heat kernel methods , @xmath15 where @xmath16 are coefficients related to the function @xmath14 and @xmath17 are seeley dewitt coefficients , expressed in terms of the curvature of @xmath2 and ( derivatives of ) the gauge and scalar fields .",
    "this action is interpreted as an effective field theory for energies lower than @xmath13 .",
    "one important feature of the spectral action is that it gives the usual pati  salam action with unification of the gauge couplings @xcite ( cf .",
    "this is very similar to the case of the spectral standard model @xcite where there is unification of gauge couplings .",
    "since it is well known that the sm gauge couplings do not meet exactly , it is crucial to investigate the running of the pati ",
    "salam gauge couplings beyond the standard model and to find a scale @xmath13 where there is grand unification : @xmath18 this would then be the scale at which the spectral action is valid as an effective theory .",
    "there is a hierarchy of three energy scales : sm , an intermediate mass scale @xmath19 where symmetry breaking occurs and which is related to the neutrino majorana masses ( @xmath20gev ) , and the gut scale @xmath13 .    for simplicity , we restrict our analysis to the running of the gauge couplings at one - loop",
    "indeed , at two loops , the gauge and scalar couplings are mixed and influence each other . moreover",
    ", the running of the scalar mass terms can not be trusted at all because of quadratic divergences .",
    "thus , we analyze the running of the gauge couplings according to the usual ( one - loop ) rg equation where each takes the form @xmath21 the coefficient @xmath22 is determined by the particle content and their representation theory @xcite for which we use @xcite as well as the program pyr@te . as mentioned before , depending on the assumptions on @xmath8",
    ", one may vary to a limited extent the scalar particle content , consisting of either composite or fundamental scalar fields .",
    "we will not limit ourselves to a specific model but consider all cases separately .",
    "in fact , we establish grand unification for all of them , thus confirming validity of the spectral action at the corresponding scale , independent of the specific form of @xmath8 .",
    "one of the pressing questions at present is whether there is new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the success of the spectral construction of the standard model , predicting its particle content , including gauge fields , higgs fields as well as a singlet whose vev gives majorana mass to the right handed neutrino , is a strong signal that we are on the right track .",
    "the route that led to this conclusion starts with classifying the algebras of the finite space .",
    "the results show that the only algebras which solve the fermion doubling problem are of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an even integer .",
    "an arbitrary symplectic constraint is imposed on the first algebra restricting it from @xmath25 to @xmath26 the first non - trivial algebra one can consider is for @xmath27 with the algebra @xcite @xmath28 coincidentally , and as explained in the introduction , the above algebra comes out as a solution of the two - sided heisenberg quantization relation between the dirac operator @xmath7 and the two maps from the four spin - manifold and the two four spheres @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this removes the arbitrary symplectic constraint and replaces it with a relation that quantize the four - volume in terms of two quanta of geometry and have far reaching consequences on the structure of space - time .",

    "these restrictions lead to important constraints on the structure of the connection that appears in the inner fluctuations of the dirac operator .",
