    "recently , new observational limits for the mass and the mass - radius relationship of compact stars have been obtained which provide stringent constraints on the equation of state of strongly interacting matter at high densities , see @xcite and references therein . in particular , the high mass of @xmath4 for the pulsar j0751 + 1807 in a neutron star - white dwarf binary system @xcite and the large radius of @xmath5 km for the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( shorthand : rx j1856 ) @xcite point to a stiff equation of state at high densities .",
    "measurements of high masses are also reported for compact stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) as , e.g. , @xmath6 for the compact object in 4u 1636 - 536 @xcite . for another lmxb , exo 0748 - 676 ,",
    "constraints for the mass @xmath7 _ and _ the radius @xmath8 km have been reported @xcite .",
    "the status of these data is , however , unclear since the observation of a gravitational redshift @xmath9 in the x - ray burst spectra @xcite could not be confirmed thereafter despite numerous attempts @xcite .",
    "we exclude possible constraints from lmxbs from the discussion in the present paper as their status is not settled and they would not tighten the mass and mass - radius limits provided by j0751 + 1807 and rx j1856 , respectively .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that deconfined quark matter can not exist in the centers of compact stars with masses and radii as reported for these objects . in view of recent works on the quark matter eos",
    ", however , this claim appears to be premature @xcite .    in the present paper , we demonstrate that the present - day knowledge of hydrodynamical properties of dense matter allows to construct hybrid esos with a critical density of the deconfinement phase transition low enough to allow for extended quark matter cores and stiff enough to comply with the new mass measurements of compact stars .",
    "it has been shown recently by alford et al .",
    "@xcite that hybrid stars can masquerade as neutron stars once the parameters of a generic phenomenological quark matter eos have been chosen appropriately . while in @xcite the apr eos @xcite for",
    "the hadronic phase has been used , we base our investigation on a nuclear eos obtained from the ab initio dbhf approach using the bonn a potential @xcite which results in star configurations with larger radii and masses .",
    "the dbhf eos is soft at moderate densities ( compressibility k=230 mev ) @xcite but tends to become stiffer at high densities . at densities up to 2 - 3 times nuclear saturation density it is in agreement with constraints from heavy ion collisions based on collective flow @xcite and kaon production @xcite .",
    "however , at higher densities this eos seems to be too repulsive concernig the flow constraint .",
    "as we will show in the present paper , the problems of this eos with an early onset of the nuclear direct urca ( du ) process and a violation of the flow constraint for heavy - ion collisions at high densities can be solved by adopting a phase transition to quark matter .",
    "we have no first principle information from qcd about the quark matter eos in the nonperturbative domain close to the chiral/ deconfinement transition at zero temperature and finite density which would be required for an ab - initio study of the problem whether deconfined quark matter can exist in neutron stars or not .",
    "therefore it is desireable to develop microscopic approaches to the quark matter eos on the basis of effective models implementing , as far as possible , qcd symmetries into the model lagrangian .",
    "such an approach should in particular be capable of describing the phenomena of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking / restoration and color superconductivity in dense quark matter @xcite , going thus beyond the traditional bag model approaches widely used for phenomenological studies of quark matter in compact stars , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a powerful modeling of qcd in the perturbative and nonperturbative domain is obtained using dyson - schwinger equations @xcite which recently have been extended also to the finite density domain @xcite .",
    "they appear as most promising candidate theories for a future systematic qcd modeling of dense qcd matter in compact stars .    for the present study , however",
    ", we will employ the lagrangian of a nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with chiral symmetry which is dynamically broken in the nonperturbative vacuum and restored at finite temperatures in accordance with lattice qcd simulations .",
    "therefore , the application of the njl model to finite densities where presently no reliable lattice qcd simulations exist , can be regarded as a step beyond the bag model phenomenology towards a dynamical approach to nonperturbative quark matter effects in compact stars , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "although the standard njl model is quite simple , based on a few parameters , such as the momentum cutoff and coupling constants for a set of interaction channels , it offers possibilities for generalizations , like a density - dependence of the cutoff parameter @xcite , momentum - dependent formfactors @xcite and an infrared cutoff to account for confinement @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will use a standard three - flavor njl model , where in contrast to the approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite we base our investigation on selfconsistently determined quark masses and pairing gaps @xcite , similar to the parallel developments in refs .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it allows , e.g. , to distinguish two- and three - flavor phases in quark matter ( for a first discussion , see @xcite ) and conclusions about the presence of gapless phases at zero temperature as a function of the coupling strengths in the current - current - type interaction of the model lagrangian @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will investigate the question of the stability of neutron stars with a color superconducting quark matter core in the celebrated cfl phase , for which a number of phenomenological applications have been studied , in particular the cooling problem @xcite , gamma - ray bursts @xcite , and superbursts @xcite .",
    "we will confirm in this work the earlier result by baldo et al .",
    "@xcite and buballa et al .",
    "@xcite that a cfl quark matter core renders the hybrid star unstable .",
    "here we generalize the model @xcite by including an isoscalar vector meson current which , similar to the walecka model for nuclear matter , leads to a stiffening of the quark matter eos .",
    "increasing the scalar diquark coupling constant leads to a lowering of the phase transition density .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to determine the unknown coupling strengths in both these channels such that an optimal hybrid star eos is obtained .",

    "we have omitted the chiral partner terms which would be necessary to establish the chiral symmetry of the lagrangian as their contributions to the thermodynamical potential vanish at the mean - field ( hartree ) level to which we restrict ourselves in the present paper .",
    "the model is similar to the models in @xcite , except that we include also the isoscalar vector meson channel .",
    "we follow the argument given in @xcite , that the u@xmath23(1 ) symmetry breaking in the pseudoscalar isoscalar meson sector is dominated by quantum fluctuations and no t  hooft determinant interaction needs to be adopted for its realization .",
    "after bosonization using hubbard - stratonovich transformations , we obtain an exact transformation of the original partition function ( [ zqqbar ] ) .",
    "the transformed expression constitutes the starting point for powerful approximations , defined as truncations of the taylor expanded action functional to different orders in the collective boson fields . in the following , we use the mean - field ( mf ) approximation .",
    "this means that the bosonic functional integrals are omitted and the collective fields are fixed at the extremum of the action .",

    "we have to obey constraints of charge neutrality which depend on the application we consider . in the ( approximately ) isospin symmetric situation of a heavy - ion collision ,",
    "the color charges are neutralized , while the electric charge in general is non - zero . for matter in @xmath34-equilibrium , also the electric charge is neutralized . for further details ,",
    ".    we consider @xmath22 as a free parameter of the quark matter model , to be tuned with the present phenomenological constraints on the high - density eos .",
    "similarly , the relation between the coupling in the scalar and vector meson channels , @xmath21 , is considered as a free parameter of the model .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom are fixed according to the njl model parameterization in table i of @xcite , where a fit to low - energy phenomenological results has been made .",
    "a consistent relativistic approach to the quark hadron phase transition where the hadrons appear as bound states of quarks is not yet developed .",
    "first steps in the direction of such a unified approach to quark - hadron matter have been accomplished within the njl model in @xcite . in this paper , however , the role of quark exchange interactions between hadrons ( pauli principle on the quark level ) has yet been disregarded . as has been demonstrated within a nonrelativistic potential model approach",
    ", these contributions may be essential for a proper understanding of the short - range repulsion @xcite as well as the asymmetry energy at high - densities @xcite .",
    "in the present work we apply a so - called two - phase description where the nuclear matter phase is described within the relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach considered in @xcite and the transition to the quark matter phase given above is obtained by a maxwell construction .",
    "the critical chemical potential of the phase transition is obtained from the equality of hadronic and quark matter pressures .",
    "a discussion of the reliability of the maxwell construction for the case of a set of conserved charges is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the baryon density as derivative of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical potential exhibits a jump at the phase transition , as shown for isospin - symmetric matter in fig .  [ fig : dan ] . as can be seen in that figure , a slight variation of the quark matter model parameters @xmath22 and @xmath21 results in considerable changes of the critical density for the phase transition and the behaviour of the pressure ( stiffness ) at high densities .",
    "there appears the problem of a proper choice of these parameters which we suggest to solve by applying the flow constraint @xcite to symmetric matter , shown as the hatched area in fig.[fig : dan ] .",
    "at first we fix the vector coupling by demanding that the high density behavior of the hybrid eos should be as stiff as possible but still in accordance with the flow constraint .",
    "we obtain @xmath35 , independent of the choice of the scalar diquark coupling .",
    "the latter we want to determine such that the problem of the violation of the flow constraint for the dbhf eos in symmetric nuclear matter at high densities is resolved by the phase transition to quark matter .",
    "the optimal choice for @xmath22 is thus between 1.02 and 1.03 . in the following",
    "we will investigate the compatibility of the now defined hybrid star equation of state with cs constraints .",
    "recently , observations of compact objects have resulted in new limits for masses and radii which put stringent constraints on the high - density behaviour of the nuclear matter eos , see @xcite .",
    "particularly demanding data come from the pulsar psr j0751 + 1807 with a lower mass limit of @xmath36  m@xmath37 @xcite , and the isolated compact star rx j1856 with a mass - radius relationship supporting a radius exceeding 13.5 km for typical masses below @xmath38 or masses above @xmath39 for stars with radii @xmath40 km @xcite . in fig.[fig : m - r ] we display these constraints together with lines of constant gravitational redshift as , e.g. , for the putative surface redshift measurement @xcite of exo 0748 - 676 .",
    "the above constraints have to be explained by any reliable cs eos , i.e. the mass radius relation resulting from a corresponding solution of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations has to touch each of the regions shown in fig .  [ fig : m - r ] .",
    "this is well fulfilled for the purely hadronic dbhf eos .",
    "it is widely assumed that if quark matter would exist in css , the maximum mass would be significantly lower than for nuclear matter stars ( nms ) .",
    "this argumentation has been used to claim that quark matter in neutron stars is in contradiction with observations @xcite .",
    "as we will show in this work , large hybrid star masses can be obtained for sufficiently stiff quark matter esos . in this case , the corresponding hybrid ( njl+dbhf ) qcs sequence is not necessarily ruled out by phenomenology .",
    "the stiffness of the quark matter eos can be significantly increased when the vector meson interaction of the njl model introduced in section [ sec : eos ] is active .",
    "the maximum value of the vector coupling which is still in accordance with the upper limit extrapolation of the flow constraint , @xmath35 , see fig .  1",
    ", allows a maximum mass of @xmath41 . with this choice",
    "the constraints from psr j0751 + 1807 and rx j1856 displayed in fig .",
    "2 can be fulfilled .",
    "the maximum mass is rather inert to changes of the diquark coupling @xmath22 whereas the critical mass for the occurrence of a quark matter core gets significantly lowered by increasing the value of @xmath22 .",
    "for example , the choice of @xmath22 in the range @xmath42 corresponds to critical star masses from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , see figs .  2 and 4 .",
    "we find for all hybrid eos studied in this paper that the occurrence of a cfl quark matter core renders the compact star unstable .",
    "this confirms earlier findings by baldo et al .",
    "@xcite and buballa et al .",
    "@xcite for slightly different hybrid esos .",
    "an additional test to the mass - radius relationship is provided by a measurement of the gravitational redshift of line emissions from the cs surface .",
    "the disputed measurement of @xmath9 for exo 0748 - 676 @xcite would be in accordance with both nms and qcs interpretations .",
    "a measurement of @xmath45 could not be accommodated with the qcs model suggested here , while the nms would not be invalidated by redshift measurements up to @xmath46 .",
    "next we want to discuss the question whether measurements of the moment of inertia  ( moi )  @xmath47 might serve as a tool to distinguish pure nms from qcs models .",
    "due to the discovery of the relativistic double pulsar psr j0737 + 3039 a measurement of the moi became a possibility and has been recently discussed as another constraint on the eos of compact stars , assuming that future measurements will exhibit an error of only about @xmath48 @xcite . in our calculations",
    "we follow the definition of the moi given in ref .",
    "@xcite and show the results for the esos of the present paper in fig .  [",
    "fig : moi ] . due to the fact that the mass 1.338 @xmath49 of psr j0737 + 3039 a is in the vicinity of the suggested critical mass region , the quark matter core is small and",
    "the expected moi of the hybrid star will be practically indistinguishable from that of a pure hadronic one .",
    "the situation would improve if the moi could be measured for more massive objects because the difference in the moi of both alternative models for masses as high as @xmath50 could reach the @xmath48 accuracy level .",
    "finally we would like to discuss the question whether there are observables suited to distinguish between pure neutron stars and those with a quark matter interior . as we have seen in the previous results ,",
    "the hydrodynamic behavior of the hybrid star eos has to be rather similar to that of pure hadronic matter in order to allow for sufficiently large masses .",
    "if so , the moment of inertia and other mechanical properties of the resulting stars will turn out to be indistinguishable to the level of a few percent .",
    "a different situation might occur for cs cooling where the transport properties and thus the excitation spectra of the dense matter play the essential role . as an example , pairing gaps of the order of an mev or below will not affect the thermodynamics but are sufficiently large to influence on neutrino cooling processes .",
    "let us discuss the example of the direct urca ( du ) process .",
    "if the du process would occur in hadronic matter , it would give rise to a fast cooling and result in a strong sensitivity to slightest mass changes of the corresponding compact object . therefore",
    ", it should not occur in css with masses below @xmath51  m@xmath37 , as this would provide a cooling rate that is inconsistent with cs population syntheses @xcite .",
    "if on the other hand the du process does _ not _ occur in a hadronic star , one would require that young , fast coolers such as vela and 3c58 should have a rather large mass , again in contradiction with the present population syntheses @xcite .",
    "a possible resolution to this hadronic cooling problem could be a phase transition to quark matter with moderately enhanced cooling .",
    "this has been demonstrated for hybrid stars with a 2sc+x quark matter phase @xcite which is in accordance with all presently known cooling constraints @xcite .",
    "the physical nature of the hypothetical x - gap is , however , not yet clarified .",
    "a discussion of this issue can be found in refs . @xcite .    for the dbhf eos",
    "the du threshold is at @xmath52  @xmath3 corresponding to a cs mass of @xmath53  m@xmath37 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : m_n ] .",
    "the hybrid eos presented in this work has a critical density for the quark matter phase transition which is below @xmath54 provided a value @xmath55 is chosen .",
    "thus for the parameter values @xmath56 and @xmath57 the present eos for hybrid star matter fulfills all modern observational constraints discussed above .",
    "we have investigated the compatibility of present constraints on the high density eos with the concept of css possessing a qm core .",
    "the hadronic part of the eos was taken from the dbhf approach , while the qm eos is provided by a chiral njl - type quark model with current - current interactions in the color singlet isoscalar scalar and vector meson channels as well as in the color antitriplet scalar diquark channels .",
    "the finite vector meson coupling enables us to describe large hybrid star masses by stiffening the qm eos , whereas the chosen value for the diquark coupling ensures a sufficiently early phase transition to qm in order to avoid the activation of du cooling within the hadronic shell of the hybrid star .",
    "since the high density qm part of the eos is softer than the corresponding pure hadronic eos also the flow constraint is fulfilled in this scenario .",
    "we discussed the possibility to distinguish between pure nss and hybrid stars by hypothetical data from successful measurements of the moi for stars of a given mass .",
    "it turned out , that this would be possible for rather massive objects ( @xmath58 ) provided the standard deviation of the measurements is less than @xmath48 , as expected for psr j0737 + 3039 a.    as our main result we conclude that _ no present phenomenological finding bears a strong argument against the presence of a qm core inside nss .",
    "_ moreover , we demonstrated that problems with cooling and flow which appear as weak points of a purely hadronic eos at large densities can be resolved in a natural way when a transition to qm occurs at not too large densities .",
    "the most common argument against the presence of qm in css , resulting from the _ prejudice _ of the softness of qm esos , is no longer valid if we account for a vector meson interaction channel which stiffens the eos .",
    "the earlier finding @xcite that the occurrence of cfl quark matter renders hybrid stars unstable has been reconfirmed and therefore it should become customary for phenomenological scenarios of compact star evolution based on the assumption of a cfl quark matter phase ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) to check the necessary constraint of stability against gravitational collapse .",
    "the present study of dense quark matter in compact stars , albeit based on a microscopic dynamical approach used the strongly simplified njl model interaction .",
    "it is desireable to repeat the present study for more realistic microscopic approaches to the qcd eos , e.g. , on the basis of the qcd dyson - schwinger equation approach where interactions are nonlocal and momentum - dependent .",
    "one intermediate step towards this goal could consist in using lattice qcd results on the momentum dependence of the quark selfenergies @xcite to adjust covariant formfactors of nonlocal , separable models @xcite for the equation of state of quark matter in compact stars .",
    "[ subsec : sum ]      after receiving the proofs for this letter we have been informed that the mass of pulsar j0751 * 1807 has been corrected by nice @xcite using a longer data base which allows to improve the value of the orbital decay and the detection of the shapiro delay . instead of previously @xmath59 @xmath60",
    "the new value is @xmath61 with estimated errors from @xmath62 @xmath60 and @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "therefore the mass of this object does no longer hold as a constraint on the eos as described above . however , other new observations provide mounting evidence for the existence of a high maximum compact star mass .",
    "in addition to the lmxb 4u 1636 - 536 with @xmath65 @xcite mentioned in the introduction , very recent measurements on millisecond pulsars in globular clusters yield @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xmath60 for psr b1516 + 02b and psr j1748 - 2021b , respectively @xcite .",
    "we also note that recent observations of the thermal polar cap emission of the quiescent lmxb x7 in the globular cluster 47 tuc yield a rather large radius of @xmath68 km for a 1.4 solar mass compact star @xcite , which comes close to the lower bound on the mass - radius relation provided by rx j1856 - 3754 which is quoted in our letter . in summary",
    "we conclude that the large radii and masses found in several compact stars require a rather stiff equation of state .",

    "<S> we present a hybrid equation of state ( eos ) for dense matter that satisfies phenomenological constraints from modern compact star ( cs ) observations which indicate high maximum masses ( @xmath0 ) and large radii ( @xmath1 km ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding isospin symmetric eos is consistent with flow data analyses of heavy - ion collisions and a deconfinement transition at @xmath2 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the quark matter phase is described by a 3-flavor nambu  jona - lasinio model that accounts for scalar diquark condensation and vector meson interactions while the nuclear matter phase is obtained within the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach using the bonn - a potential . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that both pure neutron stars and neutron stars with quark matter cores are consistent with modern cs observations . </S>",
    "<S> hybrid star configurations with a cfl quark core are unstable within the present model . + pacs number(s ) : 04.40.dg , 12.38.mh , 26.60.+c , 97.60.jd </S>"
