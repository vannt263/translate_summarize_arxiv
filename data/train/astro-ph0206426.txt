    "cataclysmic variable stars are close binary systems in which mass is transferred from a low - mass secondary onto a white dwarf ; @xcite has written an excellent monograph on cataclysmics . in the dwarf nova subclass , the transferred matter",
    "is thought to accumulate in an accretion disk until a critical density is reached , whereupon the transfer of matter through the disk dramatically increases , causing a brightening of the star .",
    "the outbursts of dwarf novae range widely in amplitude and frequency , with the less - frequently outbursting systems tending to have the greatest amplitudes ( the kukarkin - parenago relation ) .",
    "the orbital periods @xmath8 of dwarf novae range from @xmath9 hours down to about 75 minutes , near the theoretical minimum period for a hydrogen - rich donor star @xcite .",
    "( we do not here consider systems with helium donor stars , which can reach much shorter periods . )",
    "dwarf novae with @xmath8 less than about 3 h ( effectively , those shortward of the 2 - 3 h period ` gap ' ) show occasional large - amplitude , long - duration outbursts , called superoutbursts , which are accompanied by photometric oscillations , called superhumps , which have periods @xmath10 a few percent _ longer _ than @xmath8 . superoutbursters are classified as su uma stars , after their prototype .",
    "but su uma stars show a wide range of intervals between outbursts , from about 4 days for er uma and its brethren @xcite , to several decades for wz sge and similar stars @xcite .    here",
    "we report extensive observations of the dwarf novae gw lib and v844 her , which prove to have very short orbital periods .",
    "we also present a spectrum of di uma , another very short period system . in spite of their similar orbital periods ,",
    "these three systems have quite different outburst characteristics .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes observational protocols and the analysis which produced orbital periods for gw lib and v844 her .",
    "sections 3 , 4 , and 5 contain more detailed discussions of gw lib , v844 her , and di uma respectively . finally , section 6 contrasts the three systems and discusses implications for cataclsymic binary evolution .",
    "our spectroscopy is from the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory .",
    "the modular spectrograph and a @xmath11 ccd detector gave spectra covering 4300  7500   at 2 pixel@xmath6 , and a 1 arcsec slit gave 3.5   resolution over most of the range .",
    "we observed flux standards when appropriate , took comparison lamps frequently as the telescope tracked , and reduced the data using standard procedures in iraf .",
    "a few spectra were adjusted slightly in velocity when checks of the @xmath12 night - sky line revealed that a comparison lamp exposure had gone awry . from these checks",
    "we estimate our velocity scale to be correct to within @xmath13 km s@xmath6 and rather more stable than this .",
    "the flux scale suffers from occasional clouds , uncalibrated losses at the spectrograph slit , and a poorly - understood instrumental problem which causes inconsistent continuum shapes among the standard stars .",
    "the spectra shown here are averages of many , which appears to have ameliorated these problems .",
    "figs .  1 and 2 show averaged spectra of all the objects , and table 1 gives quantitative measures of the spectra .",
    "for gw lib and v844 her , our spectra were extensive enough for us to derive orbital periods .",
    "we measured velocities of the h@xmath0 emission using convolution techniques @xcite , and searched for periods among the resulting time series ( fig .",
    "3 ) using the sinusoidal fit method described by @xcite .",
    "to asses the reliability of alias choices we used the monte carlo test of @xcite .",
    "table 2 ( available in full in the electronic version of this paper ) lists the radial velocities , table 3 gives sinusoidal fits to the velocities at the preferred periods of the form @xmath14,\\ ] ] and fig .",
    "4 shows the velocities folded at the best periods , with the fits superposed . in table 3",
    ", @xmath15 is the uncertainty of a single velocity derived from the goodness of fit .",
    "because the emission lines may not reflect the motion of either star accurately , we caution against using @xmath16 or @xmath17 for dynamics .",
    "however , experience suggests that the spectroscopic @xmath18 should be a reliable measure of @xmath8 .",
    "our photometric data are more various .",
    "we obtained time - series photometry of the outburst of v844 her using the center for backyard astrophysics network of photometrists ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , on 2000 jan .  11 ut we obtained @xmath19 images of gw lib with the hiltner 2.4 m and the central 1024@xmath20 pixels of a site @xmath11 ccd , at a scale of 0.275 arcsec pixel@xmath6 .",
    "these were calibrated with observations of @xcite standard stars .",
    "gw lib was discovered in 1983 as a 9th magnitude novalike object @xcite .",
    "after the object faded to @xmath21 , @xcite found a strong blue continuum with relatively sharp balmer emission lines .",
    "@xcite lists its classification as uncertain between nova or dwarf nova .",
    "@xcite also show a spectrum , note its similarity to wz sge , and classify gw lib as a dwarf nova .",
    "the outburst recurrence time is likely to be very long ( @xmath22 yr ) , though outbursts could have gone undetected given the star s low ecliptic latitude ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "@xcite report extensive time - series photometry of gw lib in 1997 , 1998 , and 2001 , and found dominant oscillations at periods near 650 , 370 , and 230 s. the pulsation spectrum is unstable , with many signals closely spaced in frequency .",
    "they interpret these signals as arising from non - radial pulsations of the white dwarf , making it the only such pulsator also known to be accreting .",
    "a report of their early results prompted us to observe the star in 1999 june .",
    "@xcite report spectroscopy of gw lib , from which they derived an orbital period of @xmath24 minutes and found the signature of a white dwarf photosphere in the mean spectrum .",
    "our results described below are in broad agreement , but we do find a significantly shorter orbital period of @xmath25 min .",
    "many of our observations occurred on adjacent nights , allowing cycles to be counted from night to night , but their three nights were separated too widely in time to allow this . thus the present determination supersedes that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also obtained an hst spectrum in 2002 january which indicates a white - dwarf temperature of 14,700 kelvin ; our less precise measure ( see below ) is in satisfactory agreement with this determination .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite detected a 2.09-h photometric modulation in observations obtained 2001 may ( but not in observations obtained at other times ) .",
    "they note that this periodicity has no particular relationship to the orbital period , and that its cause is unknown .",
    "because of gw lib s southerly declination , we pushed the observations to airmasses as large as 4.6 to obtain the largest possible range of hour angle , and hence the greatest discrimination between daily cycle - count aliases .",
    "the resulting data set spans 5.5 h , and includes 88 exposures of 300 s each . in the mean spectrum ( fig .",
    "1 ) the continuum at @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath27 ; because an unknown fraction of the light is lost at the slit , this is in fair agreement with the magnitudes derived from the ccd photometry , namely @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the strong blue continuum and balmer absorption wings suggest that the bulk of the light arises in a white dwarf photosphere .",
    "the balmer emission lines are unusually narrow , with gaussian fits giving @xmath13    fwhm ( full width half maximum ) .",
    "weak hei emission is visible at @xmath30 5876 , 6678 , and 7027 .",
    "an emission feature near @xmath31 5169 is present , which is usually attributed to feii , and the na d lines appear weakly in emission .",
    "all other features are artifacts ; they include incompletely subtracted night sky lines at @xmath30 5577 and 6300 , and a telluric absorption band at @xmath31 6870 which did not divide out completely .",
    "the convolution function used for the velocities was optimized for 10   fwhm , so our velocities pertain to the narrow line core .",
    "the periodogram ( fig .  3 ) indicates an orbital frequency near 18.75 cycles d@xmath6 , and the monte carlo test shows that the choice of daily cycle count is secure at @xmath32 per cent confidence . the orbital period ",
    "@xmath25 min  is the shortest known for dwarf nova accreting from companions with normal hydrogen abundances ( the secondary stars in shorter - period objects such as rx2329 + 06 are probably enriched in helium ; @xcite ) .      the long outburst interval , short orbital period , and spectral appearance of gw lib make it an excellent match for wz sge . in fig .  1 we present a spectrum of wz sge for comparison ",
    "they appear very similar , except the emission lines of gw lib are much narrower .",
    "the narrowness of the emission lines suggests a low binary inclination .",
    "wz sge has @xmath33 @xcite , and the emission lines in our spectrum of wz sge are about five times wider than those in gw lib . attributing the difference entirely to inclination leads to an estimate of @xmath34 .",
    "the emission in wz sge has a strong s - wave component ; we do not resolve this component in gw lib ( indeed , we do nt see any clear substructure in the emission lines ) , but an s - wave contribution may be dominating the apparent motion of the line .    apparently , no accurate photometry was obtained during gw lib s only known outburst , but the photographic magnitude at discovery was estimated as 9.0 . since @xmath35 for dwarf novae in outburst , we take the outburst @xmath36 magnitude to be near 9 .",
    "@xcite presents a standard - candle relationship for dwarf novae in outburst , which predicts an @xmath37 at this @xmath8 .",
    "superoutbursts tend to be about 1 mag brighter than this , so we estimate @xmath38 .",
    "warner s relation is reckoned at @xmath39 , but gw lib is evidently more face - on than this , making it about 1 magnitude brighter than at the canonical inclination , or @xmath40 .",
    "this would put gw lib at only @xmath41 pc distance .",
    "our quiescent @xmath42 then implies @xmath43 .",
    "because of the short distance indicated by the above arguments , we searched for a proper motion .",
    "the digitized sky survey has two epochs available , 1976.3 and 1991.3 .",
    "gw lib was also imaged in the original palomar observatory sky survey ( epoch 1955.4 for this field ) , and dr .",
    "david monet of usno kindly provided us with coordinates from this survey measured with the usno plate measuring machine .",
    "we use our i - band 2.4 m ccd image for the final epoch ( 2000.02 ) .",
    "the ccd image gave the best internal precision , so we fit centroids from this image to the usno a2.0 catalog to derive refined nominal standard coordinates for 99 field stars , and then transformed coordinates from the other images onto this system using 6-constant plate model fits .",
    "gw lib showed a significant proper motion @xmath44 mas yr@xmath6 in position angle @xmath45 degrees .",
    "this corroborates a short distance ; its transverse velocity would be 39 km s@xmath6 at 110 pc .",
    "the celestial coordinates of gw lib for epoch and equinox 2000 refererred to the usno a2.0 system ( nominally icrs ) are @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we estimated the white dwarf s atmospheric parameters by fitting the balmer line profiles to a grid of synthetic white - dwarf spectra spanning @xmath48 from 10000 to 84000 kelvin and @xmath49 from 7.0 to 9.0 , with @xmath50 .",
    "these were computed using a new version of the @xcite computer code modified to include convection within the existing numerical treatment .",
    "potential convective instability of each depth layer was tested against the standard schwarzschild criterion and the convective flux was computed using the mixing length formalism @xcite .",
    "we adopted convective parameters appropriate for zz ceti white dwarfs following the analysis of @xcite , namely the ml2 parameters with the mixing length over pressure scale height ratio @xmath0 adjusted to 0.6 .",
    "neutral hydrogen b - b , b - f , and f - f opacities as well as b - f and f - f opacities of the negative hydrogen ion are included in the calculation .",
    "the model atmospheres are converged until the total flux is constant to at least one part in @xmath51 .",
    "detailed stark - broadened synthetic line profiles are computed based on the converged models .",
    "5 shows the best fit to the h@xmath0 and h@xmath52 line profiles .",
    "the central emission is excluded from the fit ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "a general search between @xmath54 k and 30,000 k reveals a best solution at @xmath55 and log @xmath56 .",
    "this solution is totally incompatible with the optical spectral energy distribution which imposes a much cooler temperature . restricting the fit to the range of temperature between 10,000 and 14,000 k reveals a solution close to 13,000 k.",
    "a slightly different solution is obtained when excluding @xmath5740from the h@xmath0 core , and @xmath5730   from h@xmath52 .",
    "a comparison of the two solutions underlines systematic effects due to the incompleteness of the data set .",
    "adding possible continuum disk contamination to the synthetic spectra in the form of a contribution corresponding to 5% and above of the observed flux at 5500 , eliminates all solutions below 16,000 kelvin , so the disk contamination appears to be small .",
    "the best - fit parameters ( @xmath58k , log@xmath59 ) are above the zz ceti instability strip but the 90% confidence contour extends within the range ascribed to the pulsating class of da white dwarfs by @xcite , using the ml2 @xmath60 formalism .",
    "the results of the present analysis are uncertain , because ( 1 ) systematic effects such as disk contamination are not well ascertained and ( 2 ) the quality of the line profile fit is not satisfactory and is based on only two lines . as noted earlier , @xcite find a temperature of 14,700 k for the white dwarf based on an hst uv spectrum ; our result is consistent with theirs , but is likely to be less accurate for the reasons noted above .",
    "v844 herculis is a dwarf nova discovered by @xcite in a search for variable stars in a photographic survey with the 40 cm crimean astrograph . on 419 plates in the interval 1960 - 1994 , antipin found variations in the range b=12.5 - 17.5 , with the best - observed outburst lasting 12 - 18 days",
    "this announcement captured the attention of variable - star observers , and the star has now become frequently monitored by visual observers .",
    "long outbursts were seen in may 1997 and december 1998 , and the outburst of october 1996 was probably also long .",
    "the interval between these long outbursts is not securely known , but is probably about 280 days .",
    "news of the may 1997 outburst drove the cba network into action .",
    "starting with the third night of outburst , we obtained photometric coverage on 21 of 37 nights , following the star all the way down to quiescence .",
    "the photometry log is given in table 4 .",
    "the eruption timescale ( 15 d bright , followed by rapid return to quiescence in 1 - 2 d ) is typical of superoutbursts in su uma stars .",
    "even more characteristic are the photometric waves ( superhumps ) prominent throughout the eruption .",
    "6 ( upper panel ) shows the superhumps in one long night of coverage .",
    "these establish the star s membership in the su uma class of dwarf novae .",
    "we calculated the mean superhump amplitude and time of maximum light for each night of observation .",
    "these measurements are given in the final columns of table 4 .",
    "the amplitude spectrum of the 10-day superoutburst light curve ( jd 2450592 - 602 ) is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 , indicating a powerful signal at @xmath61 cycle d@xmath6 and its first harmonic .",
    "a signal is seen near 71.88 cycle d@xmath6 also . since we know the orbital frequency to be @xmath62 cycle d@xmath6 ( see below ) , we interpret 17.87 cycle d@xmath6 as the basic superhump frequency , the @xmath63 lower precessional sideband of the orbital frequency .",
    "then the 35.75 cycle d@xmath6 signal is the first harmonic , at @xmath64 .",
    "the identification of the 71.88 cycle d@xmath6 signal is less clear , but it could be the @xmath65 component ( in general , superhumps come with @xmath66 components , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are any small integers and @xmath69 ; skillman et al .",
    "1999 ) . the superhump _ changes _ measurably in frequency and waveform during the 10-day interval , so precise identification of higher components is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "our spectra are from 1997 june and july , after the star had returned to quiescence .",
    "the observations , comprising 158 300-s exposures , span 18 d of elapsed time and 7.06 h of hour angle .",
    "the mean spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) is normal for a dwarf nova ; in particular , the hydrogen and helium lines appear similar to other dwarf novae of longer period , emphasizing that the accreted material must come from the usual hydrogen - envelope secondary despite the short orbital period .",
    "the emission lines are double - peaked ; in h@xmath0 and h@xmath52 , the peaks are separated by @xmath70 km s@xmath6 and at the half - intensity points the lines extend to @xmath71 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the continuum level implies @xmath72 , with an uncertainty of a few tenths from unknown light losses at the spectrograph slit .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission velocities ( table 2 ) were measured using the derivative of a gaussian as the convolution function ; this was optimized for a 40   line width , a little wider than the 36   observed width of h@xmath0 , in order to emphasize the wings of the line profile .",
    "we found that the velocity amplitude was strongly affected by the algorithm used , reinforcing the usual cautions about using cv emission lines for dynamical mass estimates .",
    "however , the period ( table 3 ) is determined without ambiguity .",
    "di uma @xcite has superoutbursts recurring on a timescale of 30 to 45 d. this places it among the most frequently superoutbursting su uma stars , a group loosely referred to as the er uma stars .",
    "we did not accumulate sufficient spectra to find an independent orbital period ; photometry at quiescence @xcite yields a modulation at @xmath73 d (= 78.57 min ) , which is presumably the orbital period .",
    "2 shows the mean spectrum , and table 1 lists the spectral features .",
    "the normality of the spectrum suggests that the abundances in the accreting material are normal , which in turn suggests that the secondary is not enriched in helium .",
    "in table 5 we list the seven dwarf novae ( or dwarf - nova candidates ) with the shortest well - established orbital periods .",
    "two of the systems have periods shorter than gw lib .",
    "v485 cen has a dramatically short 59-min period .",
    "@xcite explain this by invoking a low hydrogen abundance for the secondary , so it may not belong among the more usual hydrogen accretors .",
    "support for this idea comes from the apparently related system rx2329 + 06 , which has a k - type secondary at @xmath74 min , a period at which a cv secondary with normal hydrogen abundance would be be much cooler .",
    "@xcite show that a helium - enriched secondary matches the observations , and propose that mass transfer began near the end of core hydrogen burning .",
    "another system , rx2353@xmath7538 , resembles a dwarf nova spectroscopically , and it probably is one , but it has never been observed to erupt .",
    "thus the stars studied here have the three shortest periods among well - established , hydrogen - accreting dwarf novae .    in the most straightforward scenarios for cv evolution ( see @xcite for a review ) , the properties of dwarf novae are regulated by the accretion rate , which is dependent on the mass of the secondary , which depends on orbital period . thus the outburst properties should depend in a simple way on @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , stars of the shortest orbital period should have very rare outbursts , like the well - studied prototype wz sge .",
    "the truth appears to be much more complex .",
    "one of these stars , gw lib , is indeed an excellent match to wz sge : intrinsically very faint , with a recurrence period probably exceeding 10 years . yet di uma is a rather bright star ( at the distance estimated by @xcite it would have @xmath76 at minimum ) , and one of the most frantic dwarf novae in the sky , erupting at least 100 times more frequently . and",
    "v844 her is an intermediate case , but unusual in never having shown any normal outbursts ( despite the modest interval of @xmath77 d between superoutbursts ) .",
    "this is more or less the full range of activity ( and brightness ) displayed by dwarf novae .",
    "yet it occurs in three binaries with orbital periods equal to within 2 minutes .",
    "why this should be so remains a mystery .",
    "perhaps there are cycles in the mass - transfer rate over timescales long compared to the historical record , but short compared to the evolutionary timescale @xcite .",
    "also , in the most common picture of evolution at short period , the angular - momentum loss is thought to be dominated by gravitational radiation , leading to a convergence of evolution among different systems and a universal value for the minimum period .",
    "but if another , more idiosyncratic angular momentum loss mechanism persists  magnetic braking is an obvious candidate  the minimum period may not be as clearly defined , and the observed diversity of stars near the minimum may be easier to understand .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that mass - transfer cycles among short - period systems are damped out unless there is some small consequential angular momentum loss ( that is , an angular momentum loss mechanism for which @xmath78 increases modestly with @xmath79 ) .",
    "another line of evidence also suggests an extra channel for angular momentum loss .",
    "@xcite notes the apparent discrepancy between the large number of short - period and ` post - bounce ' systems predicted by theory , and the much smaller number of such systems which have actually been observed ; a second angular momentum loss mechanism which destroys short - period systems would help ameliorate that discrepancy , as well .",
