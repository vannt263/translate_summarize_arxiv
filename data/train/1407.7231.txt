    "the derivation of is equations proceeds in a variety of ways @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the derivations based on the second law of thermodynamics ( @xmath0 ) , where @xmath1 is the generalized entropy four - current , the transport coefficients related to relaxation times for shear and bulk viscous pressures remain undetermined , and have to be obtained from kinetic theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the derivations based on kinetic theory require the non - equilibrium phase - space distribution function , @xmath2 , to be specified .",
