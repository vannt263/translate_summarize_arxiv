    "in the past few years , the degree of control of cold atom experiments has increased to an impressive level , from the control of the atomic interactions @xcite and the trapping geometry @xcite , to the creation and observation of many - body correlated systems @xcite or the control at the single atom level @xcite . in order to extract quantitative measurements from such experiments",
    "one has to analyze a large number of images @xcite , which are fitted and compared to theoretical models @xcite .",
    "for instance mean - field models describe remarkably well quantum gases at low temperature , including their dynamics @xcite .",
    "however these simple models are far from exploiting all the information contained in the images .",
    "this has motivated the development of alternative _ model - free _ approaches to analyze the experimental data .",
    "for example , with the minimal assumption that the image represents accurately the gas density profile , one can directly compute averaged observables to reveal the gas collective dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is also quite efficient to represent the signal in the frequency domain , using fourier transforms , to isolate the system response to a resonant excitation @xcite . in some situations",
    "the noise itself contains a lot of information on the system @xcite that can be recovered by studying the correlations within the images @xcite .",
    "here we show that a generic method of signal analysis , principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite , provides a unique tool to extract all the relevant information from cold atom absorption images , without having to rely on a specific model .",
    "this tool has already been used to perform filtering @xcite , extract the phase in an interferometric signal @xcite and identify the main noise sources in an experiment @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that pca can be of interest to perform quantum state tomography @xcite . as part of multivariate signal analysis methods pca",
    "is widely used in numerous applications dealing with large amounts of data @xcite , to extract signals from a noisy background .",
    "the main result of this paper is that pca can be extended to the study of the elementary excitations of an ultracold atomic gas and allow the direct observation of the system normal modes .",
    "normal modes or bogoliubov modes of ultracold atomic gases are the elementary low energy excitations of the system @xcite .",
    "they provide a unique insight into the system properties",
    ". for example they can reveal the collective superfluid behaviour of bose @xcite and fermi @xcite gases or probe the system dimensionality @xcite .",
    "recently an analysis of a set of absorption images using time to frequency domain transformation @xcite has been used to isolate a few low energy collective modes and study their damping . having access to a method for data analysis which extracts the maximum information will be highly relevant for these studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the pca method for noise filtering is discussed in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we then show in section  [ sec : study ] that the pca enables a precise identification of the system low energy excitations . to support our analysis of the experimental data we compare our findings to the results of numerical simulations in section  [ sec : validation ] .",
    "finally we discuss in section  [ sec : discuss ] the requirements for applying pca to cold atom experiments and the possible improvements that may be achieved .",
    "let us briefly recall how pca proceeds @xcite .",
    "more detail ( including formulas ) is given in [ sec : pca ] .",
    "we start from a particular data set , which in our case is an ensemble of absorption images where the signal is proportional to the integrated atomic density .",
    "we first compute the average of the data set and subtract this mean image from all the images , thus obtaining an ensemble of centered images .",
    "we then compute the covariance matrix of this ensemble .",
    "the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix contain the variance of the pixels and off - diagonal elements quantify correlations between pixels . by diagonalizing this matrix",
    "we recover the eigenvectors , called principal components ( pcs ) , which are thus uncorrelated .",
    "this statistical independence ensures that uncorrelated noise sources are associated to different principal components @xcite .",
    "our experiment is described in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "briefly , we produce a quantum degenerate gas of @xmath0rb atoms confined in a radio - frequency ( rf ) dressed magnetic quadrupole trap .",
    "we can dynamically control the precise trap shape by varying the magnetic or rf fields , which results in selective excitations of the gas normal modes @xcite .",
    "we measure the gas properties by performing in - situ absorption imaging along the strongly trapped vertical direction .",
    "the peak optical density is kept below 6 by repumping only a small fraction of the cloud from the @xmath1 hyperfine ground state to the cycling transition .",
    "we carefully calibrate the imaging system following reference @xcite .",
    "the gases we consider in this paper are in the quasi two - dimensional regime : the excitations along the imaging axis are frozen and the dynamics occurs only in the horizontal plane . in this plane",
    "the system is well described by a harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "we apply the pca to the study of the mode dynamics in an anisotropic quasi two - dimensional gas ( @xmath2 ) with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "( color online ) noise analysis using pca .",
    "figure  a : averaged image ( @xmath5 pixels ) , and figures  b - l : the eleven largest principal components , sorted by decreasing eigenvalue .",
    "the number between square bracket is the eigenvalue of the principal component , expressed as a fraction of the total variance .",
    "the color scale is arbitrary for each image .",
    "the field of view is @xmath6 .",
    ", width=302 ]    as an example of application , figure  [ fig : expnoise ] displays the outcome of pca applied to 27 images acquired in the same conditions . due to variations of the stray light during image acquisition , fluctuations of atom number in the experiment or mechanical vibrations , the images are not exactly identical .",
    "the pca decomposition identifies all these sources of noise , and we can identify them with a principal component : figure  [ fig : expnoise]c probably accounts for atom number fluctuations while figure  [ fig : expnoise]b and d indicates a small jitter of the camera position @xcite .",
    "higher order components , see figure  [ fig : expnoise]e to h , reflect the presence of diffraction fringes on the probe beam intensity profile . for each of these components , the corresponding eigenvalue accounts for the fraction of the total variance due to the associated noise source .",
    "conversely , when the data set results from the variation of a parameter , pca allows to probe the sensitivity of the system to this parameter . in particular ,",
    "if the system is initially excited and evolves , measurements taken at different times allow to recover this variation as a principal component . in this paper , we exploit this possibility to directly measure the normal modes of a quantum degenerate gas confined in a harmonic trap .",
    "we make use of our highly versatile trap potential to excite simultaneously several low energy eigenmodes of the gas .",
    "namely we displace the trap minimum , we rotate the trap axes and change slightly the trap frequencies . in the new trap",
    "the gas is strongly out of equilibrium and we record its evolution by taking images for different holding times in the trap , covering a time span of @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig : scissormodeexp ] shows the result of pca for this data set ( 133 images ) .",
    "compared to figure  [ fig : expnoise ] we see that the principal components have changed .",
    "let us now identify the first principal components .",
    "the first two pcs ( see figure  [ fig : scissormodeexp]b and c ) display a two - lobe pattern oriented respectively along the columns and the rows of the images : this is characteristic of a dipole oscillation of the cloud .",
    "this center of mass motion is due to the trap minimum displacement during the excitation process .",
    "the third pc ( see figure  [ fig : scissormodeexp]d ) indicates a global variation of the signal over the whole cloud , which can be interpreted as atom number fluctuations in the experiment .",
    "part of these fluctuations are due to the fact that the lifetime in the trap is limited and atoms are lost as the holding time increases .",
    "the fourth pc ( see figure  [ fig : scissormodeexp]e ) possesses a striking spatial pattern with four lobes characteristic of a scissors excitation @xcite .",
    "note that the lobes are oriented at @xmath8 with respect to the trap axes ( aligned with the first two pcs ) as expected .",
    "the next two pcs ( see figure  [ fig : scissormodeexp]f and g ) look like compression modes of the gas , with a density depletion at the center of the cloud and a correlated augmentation of the density on the sides of the cloud .",
    "the pcs are presented by decreasing eigenvalue , meaning that they account for less and less variations in the original data set . for this particular experiment",
    "the center of mass oscillation is the dominant excitation in the cloud , followed by the response to the rotation of the trap axis and marginally by the compression of the trap . in another experiment ( not shown )",
    "where the trap rotation was not performed we have verified that no pc displayed the spatial pattern of a scissors excitation .",
    "( color online ) first principal components of an ensemble of 133 images ( @xmath9 pixels ) sampling a time interval of @xmath7 .",
    "figure  a is the mean image of the data set , containing the averaged density profile and the subsequent images ( b to l ) are the first principal components ( sorted by decreasing eigenvalue ) .",
    "the number between square brackets is the corresponding eigenvalue , expressed as a fraction of the total variance .",
    "the color scale is arbitrary for each image.,width=302 ]    this analysis of the pcs is supported by the study of the time dependent oscillations of the associated weights , computed by projecting the centered original data set on the pcs .",
    "the result of this computation is displayed on figure  [ fig : scissortime ] , for the dipoles and scissors components .",
    "let us focus first on the first two weights : they exhibit sinusoidal oscillations at the expected trap frequencies ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "this supports the fact that pca has correctly identified as independent components the center of mass motion of the cloud along the trap axes .",
    "the scissors component displays a more complex oscillation pattern .",
    "we find that the best fit to the data is given by a sum of three sinusoids , at frequencies @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the scissors component found by pca is sensitive both to the collective response of the superfluid part and to the collisionless oscillations of the normal part of the gas @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous presence of these three frequencies has been evidenced in a three dimensional bose - einstein condensate @xcite where simultaneous measurement of the superfluid and normal part of the cloud rotations were obtained by a bimodal distribution fit to the density profiles . here",
    "we note that the same pc gives access to both the superfluid and the normal response to the rotation of the trap axes which might be used to measure their relative amplitudes .",
    "let us stress that the pca is able to separate the contributions of the different modes in a given experiment which could help to design better excitation pattern or focus on higher order modes @xcite .",
    "in particular , being able to measure on the same data set the dipole mode frequencies gives access to the natural system clock @xcite .",
    "therefore pca gives access to direct comparison between measured frequencies and predictions .",
    "moreover , for the data set used in figure  [ fig : scissormodeexp ] , we find that the simple hydrodynamic models of references @xcite fail to extract these frequencies present in the oscillation of the density , probably due to the fact that several collective modes are simultaneously excited . in this case",
    "it is really essential to use a _ model - free _ approach to analyze the data set .",
    "( color online ) filled blue circles : time dependent weight of the two dipoles and the scissors components .",
    "black solid line : sinusoidal fit to the data .",
    "the vertical scale is arbitrary and independent for each curve .",
    "the first principal component can be identified to the strongest horizontal harmonic trap direction , oscillating at @xmath10 , the second to the weakest corresponding to a frequency of @xmath11 .",
    "the third component exhibits a more complicated behavior with oscillations at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "we estimate at the @xmath15 level the uncertainty on the frequency determination by the fitting procedure .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "we pursue our investigation numerically in order to compare the principal components to normal modes .",
    "we use a zero temperature two - dimensional mean field model of our cloud and perform a numerical time - dependent simulation which mimics the experimental sequence .",
    "we then extract the simulated density profiles using a regular time sampling , thus obtaining a data set of 152 computed images .",
    "we finally compare the pca of this data set to the actual normal modes of the trap , computed using the bogoliubov - de gennes equations .",
    "details on the simulations are given in [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : scissormodetheory ] displays the result of the simulations .",
    "let us first focus on the output of pca ( left panel ) : the first few pcs are like those of figure  [ fig : scissormodeexp ] , except for the atom number fluctuations which are not taken into account in the simulation .",
    "in particular , dipole , scissors , monopole - like and quadrupole - like patterns are present ( see respectively figure  [ fig : scissormodetheory]b to f ) .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the display of the normal modes ( right panel ) , and in particular by the density profiles of figures  [ fig : scissormodetheory]n - q and v. to compare these profiles quantitatively , we compute the scalar product between the principal component and the eigenmode images . we find a high degree of overlap for the largest five principal components ( dipoles : @xmath16 and @xmath17 , scissors : @xmath18 , monopole - like @xmath19 and quadrupole - like @xmath20 ) when projected onto the corresponding eigenmode .",
    "this supports the idea that the largest principal components can indeed be identified with a well defined normal mode ( see also [ sec : identification ] ) .",
    ".[tab : theory ] comparison of the first principal components oscillation frequency @xmath21 with the bogoliubov modes frequency @xmath22 and a hydrodynamic thomas - fermi model @xmath23 .",
    "all frequencies are given in units of the smallest dipole frequency @xmath24 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the numerical wave function is represented on a square @xmath25 grid with an equivalent full width of @xmath26 in both @xmath27 and @xmath28 directions .",
    "for the computations we used @xmath29 , matched to the experimental conditions .",
    "we use this model to compare the outcome of two numerical computations . on the one hand",
    "we mimic the experiment described in section  [ sec : study ] by _ a _ ) computing the system ground state for the initial potential using an imaginary time evolution algorithm ; _ b _ ) using this result as the input of a real time evolution in the final potential ; and _ c _ ) performing pca on regularly sampled density profiles during the evolution .",
    "the evolution algorithm relies on a time splitting spectral method , from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( in dimensionless units , corresponding to 6 periods of the weakest trap axis ) using a time step of @xmath32 .",
    "the total time is chosen to be close to a multiple of both dipole modes oscillation period ( 6 periods and 8 periods respectively ) : this ensures that the average density profile computed in pca is not skewed .",
    "the sampling is performed every @xmath33 .",
    "the result of this procedure is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : scissormodetheory ] .",
    "on the other hand we directly compute the small excitation spectrum using bogoliubov - de gennes equations obtained from the linearisation of around the system ground state in the final trap .",
    "this implies the ability to diagonalize a square @xmath34 matrix which is quite challenging .",
    "fortunately this matrix is sparse and we are interested only in the lowest energy part of the spectrum , which means we do not have to compute all the eigenstates .",
    "we designed a fast custom c program that uses a combination of an iterative method @xcite with an efficient sparse matrix library @xcite to compute the relevant eigenvectors .",
    "the result of this procedure is displayed in the right panel of figure  [ fig : scissormodetheory ] .",
    "we have shown that pca is very efficient to identify the normal modes of an excited ultracold gas .",
    "this may be surprising but can be understood in the framework of small excitations . using a hydrodynamic model @xcite , the gas out of equilibrium density profile may be expanded as : @xmath35}f_k(\\bm{r})$ ] , where @xmath36 labels the normal mode of frequency @xmath37 , @xmath38 describes the mode normalized density profile and @xmath39 is related to the mode population .    in the experiment we observe the gas only at discrete times @xmath40}$ ] and positions @xmath41}$ ] and",
    "therefore we can write the @xmath42-th pixel of the @xmath43-th image as @xmath44}f_k(\\bm{r}_i)+\\varepsilon(\\bm{r}_i , t_n)$ ] , where we added a pixel and time dependent noise contribution @xmath45 .",
    "pca starts with the evaluation of the centered data set , by averaging over the sampling times @xmath46 : @xmath47}f_k(\\bm{r}_i)+\\varepsilon(\\bm{r}_i , t_n)+\\delta(\\bm{r}_i)$ ] , where the @xmath48 term is close to zero for a total sampling time @xmath49 .",
    "then the @xmath50 matrix elements can be written as : @xmath51 where the term @xmath52 is the effective noise covariance between pixels @xmath42 and @xmath53 , due to the initial noise distribution and finite sampling size induced errors . providing that the @xmath52 term is small enough it is straightforward to verify that the principal components of matrix @xmath50 are the vectors @xmath54 , with eigenvalue @xmath55 . in particular this is true for @xmath56 .",
    "this constraint on @xmath57 is more stringent than the previous one , especially when two normal modes are close to degeneracy .",
    "however if these two modes have small populations they have a small contribution to the @xmath52 term .",
    "the conclusion of this analysis is twofold . on the one hand pca",
    "correctly identifies the most excited for the @xmath36-th mode is comparable to the average value of @xmath52 , then this mode remains mixed with noise components . ]",
    "eigenmodes of the system . on the other hand",
    ", the total time sampling should be large enough to resolve the beat note between these modes .",
    "for practical purposes we empirically found that taking @xmath57 equal to one beat note period is sufficient , see for example figure  [ fig : scissortime ] .",
