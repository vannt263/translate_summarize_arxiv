    "the recent reported observations of the strangeness + 1 pentaquark , @xmath0 , having minimal quark content @xmath8 , have led to a tremendous effort aimed at understanding its properties both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "many model studies and phenomenological analyses have explored various aspects of its structure and production mechanisms , and have at the same time have revealed a number of challenges for its interpretation as an exotic resonance with a particularly narrow width ( for recent experimental reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    to tackle this problem from first principles in qcd , a number of lattice studies",
    "have recently been undertaken @xcite .",
    "these have used various local spin-@xmath1 interpolating fields ( either @xmath9-type or diquark - diquark-@xmath10 type ) , and , in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , also non - local fields .",
    "several of these studies have interpreted their results as indicating the presence of a resonance , while others report signals which are consistent with @xmath9 scattering states .",
    "a major challenge in the lattice studies has been the identification of a resonance state from the @xmath9 scattering states .",
    "several groups have sought to distinguish the resonance and scattering states by comparing the masses at different volumes @xcite .",
    "the volume dependence of the residue of the lowest lying state has also been proposed as a way to identify the nature of the state @xcite .",
    "alternatively , hybrid boundary conditions have been used in refs .",
    "@xcite to differentiate the resonance in the negative parity channel from the @xmath11-wave @xmath9 scattering state .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we employed a complimentary approach to investigate spin-@xmath1 pentaquark resonances by searching for evidence of sufficient attraction between the constituents of the pentaquark state such that the resonance mass becomes lower than the sum of the free decay channel masses .",
    "we labeled this pattern as `` the standard lattice resonance signature '' because this signature is observed for conventional baryon resonances studied on the lattice @xcite . by comparing the masses of the spin-@xmath1 five - quark states to the mass of the decay channel we found no binding at any quark mass and hence no evidence for such attraction .",
    "the absence of binding can not be used to exclude the possibility of a resonance , as the attractive forces simply may not be strong enough to provide binding . on the other hand , the presence of binding would provide a compelling resonance signature warranting further study .",
    "one of the major puzzles in pentaquark phenomenology has been the anomalously small width ( @xmath12  mev ) observed in the experiments which have produced a positive signal . a possible explanation for this may be that if the pentaquark has @xmath13 , its decay to @xmath14 must be via a @xmath15-wave , which would consequently be suppressed . in this paper",
    "we therefore extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to spin-@xmath16 pentaquarks .",
    "we examine both the positive and negative parity states , in both the isoscalar and isovector channels . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the interpolating field and outline the lattice techniques employed in this analysis .",

    "@xcite as the `` colour - singlet '' @xmath9 field , has the form : @xmath17 where the @xmath18 and @xmath19 corresponds to the isospin @xmath20 and @xmath21 channels , respectively .",
    "this field has spin @xmath22 , and transforms negatively under the parity transformation @xmath23 .",
    "one can access spin-@xmath24 states by replacing the spin-0 @xmath25-meson part of @xmath26 with a spin-1 @xmath5 vector meson operator , @xmath27 where again the @xmath18 and @xmath19 corresponds to the isospin @xmath20 and @xmath21 channels , respectively .",
    "the field @xmath28 transforms as a vector under the parity transformation , and has overlap with both spin-@xmath22 and spin-@xmath24 pentaquark states .",
    "states of definite spin can be projected from @xmath28 by applying appropriate projectors , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the masses of the spin-@xmath22 and spin-@xmath24 pentaquark states are obtained from the two - point correlation function @xmath29 to project states of definite spin from the correlation function @xmath30 we apply the spin projection operators @xcite @xmath31 for spin-@xmath16 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the spin - projected correlation function receives contributions from both positive and negative parity states .",
    "the use of fixed boundary conditions in the time direction enables states of definite parity to be projected using the matrix @xcite @xmath32 for negative and positive parities , respectively .",
    "we note that this differs from that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where interpolating fields transforming as pseudovectors , in accord with the rarita - schwinger spinor - vectors , were used .",

    "note that as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the case @xmath38 to reduce the computational cost of the calculation .",
    "since the contributions to the two - point function are exponentially suppressed at a rate proportional to the energy of the state , at zero momentum the mass of the lightest state , @xmath39 , is obtained by fitting a constant to the effective mass , @xmath40 following our previous work @xcite , we search for evidence that the resonance mass has become smaller than the sum of the free decay channel mass for pentaquark states created by the interpolating field @xmath41 .",
    "for this purpose it is useful to define an effective mass splitting .",
    "for example , in an @xmath11-wave decay channel , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the appropriate baryon and meson effective masses for a specific channel . for a @xmath45-wave decay channel ,",
    "the effective masses are combined with the minimum nontrivial momentum on the lattice , @xmath46 , to create the effective energy , @xmath47 , for each decay particle , where @xmath48 is the lattice spatial extent .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that it measures a correlated mass difference , thereby suppressing the sensitivity to systematic uncertainties ( such as using different fitting ranges ) .",
    "moreover , correlations in the effective masses can cancel , leading to a more accurate determination of the mass splitting .",
    "mass difference between the @xmath49 and the @xmath45-wave @xmath50 decay channel .",

    "[ fig : delta ] the typical resonance signature is clearly seen , where the @xmath52 is bound on the lattice at heavier than physical quark masses , because of its lower energy compared with the free decay channel .    for a pentaquark resonance",
    "we shall apply the same criteria , and consider the mass splittings between the pentaquark state and the corresponding baryon and meson free two - particle scattering states .",
    "the signal we are searching for is evidence of a pentaquark bound state at quark masses near the physical regime . in table  [",

    "indeed , from their minimal quark content in the heavy quark limit , one expects to recover a @xmath52 to @xmath62 mass ratio of 3/5 . in the case of a pentaquark resonance",
    ", the analogous mass ratio will be 1 in the heavy quark limit and the mass splitting will vanish relative to the hadronic mass scale in the heavy quark limit .",
    "hence a lattice resonance signature for a pentaquark state is binding ( a negative mass splitting ) at intermediate quark masses , above the physical regime , with a general trend of binding as a fraction of hadron mass towards zero as the heavy quark limit is approached .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the spatial directions . to explore the effects of the fixed boundary condition we have examined the effective mass of the pion correlation function and the associated @xmath69 obtained in various fits .",
    "the pion is selected as it has the longest correlation length and will be a worst case scenario for the boundary effects .",

    "we have completed a comprehensive analysis of the isospin and parity states of the spin-@xmath24 pentaquark . following our previous work @xcite , we search for the standard signature of a resonance in lattice qcd , where the presence of attraction renders the resonance mass lower than the sum of the free decay channel masses at quark masses near the physical regime .",
    "this standard lattice resonance signature has been observed for every conventional baryon resonance ever calculated on the lattice @xcite .    in the case of a pentaquark resonance ,",
    "the relative mass splitting is expected to vanish in the heavy quark limit .",

    "we have discovered evidence of the standard lattice resonance signature , in the spin-@xmath24 positive - parity isoscalar channel . at intermediate quark masses ,",

    "otherwise , one can not completely rule out the possibility that the observed binding is a pure finite - volume effect , reflecting a non - trivial scattering phase shift @xcite in the @xmath125 @xmath126 scattering channel at momentum @xmath127 .",
    "if this is the case , the mass splitting will go to zero as the volume of the lattice is increased . on the other hand ,",
    "a genuine single - particle state is expected to have a small volume dependence such that the negative mass splitting is preserved in the infinite volume limit . as fig .",
    "[ fig : i0_12.pos.s.nk ] illustrates , the observed mass splitting with the @xmath14 two - particle threshold is sufficient to maintain the lattice resonance signature in the event that the volume dependence of the spin-@xmath24 positive - parity isoscalar state is indeed small .",
    "the @xmath128 channel is therefore an interesting pentaquark resonance candidate for further study .",
    "chiral fermions such as the overlap fermion action @xcite allowing access to the lightest quark masses @xcite should be brought to bear on this particular channel .",
