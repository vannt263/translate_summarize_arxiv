    "observations of seyfert 2 galaxies with  and  showed that many distinct components contribute to the soft x - ray radiation from these sources .",
    "emission from diffuse gas , extending up to a few kpc around the nucleus , was imaged with  ( e.g. , morse et al .",

    "the  galaxy was observed with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; canizares et al .",
    "2000 , in prep ) on 2000 june 6 , with acis - s ( garmire et al . 2000 ) in the focal plane .",
    "the observation was continuous , with the target at the aimpoint of the s3 chip . in order to reduce pileup in the zeroth - order , a customized subarray window of 600 rows",
    "was used , yielding a frametime of 2.1 s. with this choice , pileup is negligible : the nucleus ( the brightest x - ray point source in the field ) has @xmath0 0.2 counts / frame corresponding to a pileup fraction of 3% ( see the proposer s observatory guide , figure 6.25 ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the ` ciao ` v.1.1.5 software provided by the  x - ray center ( cxc ) .",
    "gain correction was applied using updated calibration files appropriate for the observing epoch , and we filtered for times of bad aspect and `` bad '' pixels . only  grades 0 , 2 , 4 , and 6 were accepted .",
    "the total net exposure time was 60,223 s. we checked that the s3 background was stable during the observation .",
    "acis spectra were analyzed using spectral responses generated with ` ciao ` for nodes 0 and 1 .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of our  image is @xmath0 2.5 , derived comparing the position of the nucleus in the acis image with published values from radio and optical observations ( elmouttie et al .",
    "1995 ; gardner & whiteoak 1982 ) .",
    "this is poorer than the nominal @xmath0 1  accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible to improve the absolute astrometry , as no unrelated foreground or background sources were detected in the field of view .",
    "the zeroth - order image of  in the energy range 0.58 kev is shown in figure [ figzero ] .",
    "a bright x - ray source is apparent , which we identify with the nucleus , together with several point    = 8.9 cm    sources , of which at least four are located within 5  of the nucleus . using the algorithm ` wavdetect ` ( freeman et al .",
    "2000 ) with a significance threshold of @xmath2 , twelve sources are detected in figure [ figzero ] .",
    "the x - ray sources are embedded in a faint , diffuse x - ray emission with a `` plume '' extending @xmath0 20  in the n - w direction .",
    "we estimate that , within a circle of radius 43 , @xmath0 50% of the 0.58 kev counts are from the nuclear region , while the discrete x - ray sources contribute @xmath0 30% of the counts and the extended emission 20% .",
    "the total 0.58 kev count rate from acis - s in this aperture is 0.19 counts s@xmath3 consistent with  and  ( guainazzi et al .",
    "1999 ; matt et al . 1996 ) .      the brightest x - ray source in the field , with a total of 5,309 counts in the 0.58 kev band , has x - ray coordinates @xmath4(2000)=14h 13 m 09.83s , @xmath5(2000)=65@xmath6 20  21.35 .",

    "the observed 0.58 kev profile can be fit with three gaussians : an unresolved point source with fwhm=0.8  @xmath7 0.09 , an extended component with fwhm=2.3  @xmath7 0.17 , and a second diffuse component with",
    "fwhm=18  @xmath7 2 .",
    "we identify the unresolved component with the active nucleus .",
    "based on the x - ray spectrum ( see below ) , the 2.5  component is most likely scattered nuclear radiation by ionized gas .",
    "its size ( @xmath0 50 pc ) is consistent with the size of the scattering mirror in seyfert 2s from spectropolarimetry ( e.g. , kraemer , ruiz , & crenshaw 1998 ) .",
    "the large - scale component comprises the n - w plume , scattered radiation , and possibly emission from the outer starburst ring . by integrating the best - fit gaussian models , we estimate that , in a radius of 3 , the point source contributes 70% of the 0.58 kev counts , with the inner extended  component  contributing most    -1.9cm=11.2 cm -2.2 cm    ( 29% ) of the remaining counts .",
    "energy - dependent radial profiles were also computed in the 1.01.6 , 1.62.7 , 2.74.0 , and 6.06.5 kev bands .",
    "these energy bands bracket the ranges of emission from ionized mg , si , s , and from neutral fe , respectively , while containing at the same time enough photons to allow meaningful signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the profiles are shown in figure [ profiles]a  d together with the corresponding simulated psfs .",
    "the latter were calculated with the ` marx ` simulator ( v.3.0 ) , assuming a gaussian spatial model with width @xmath8=0.17  to take into account aspect effects , and as input spectral model a power law ( photon index @xmath9 ) plus an  line , which to a first approximation describes the zero - order acis spectrum . as in the case of the 0.58 kev profile ,",
    "the energy - dependent profiles in figure [ profiles ] can be fitted with three gaussians , an unresolved ( fwhm @xmath0 0.8 ) point source , and two extended components with fwhms @xmath0 2.5  and 1421 , with uncertainties of @xmath0 34% or better .",
    "the relative contributions of the three components at various energies and extraction radii are reported in table 1 .",
    "they were obtained by integrating the best - fit gaussians of the three components . in the smaller aperture , the nucleus and the 2.5  component give roughly similar contributions at soft energies ( 2 kev ) , while at hard x - rays ( 2 kev ) the nucleus becomes dominant .",
    "is thus a different case from the seyfert 2 mrk3 , where recent  observations show that _ all _ the soft x - ray flux originates from an extended region ( sako et al .",

    "these properties suggest that a likely origin of the 2.5extended component is scattering of the nuclear radiation from ionized gas .",

    "while deeper acis observations are needed to study in detail the origin of the x - ray emission from the  cone , we briefly note that a possibility suggested by the x - ray spectrum is a blend of soft x - ray lines around 0.61 kev ( o , ne , fe l ) , possibly from gas photoionized from the nucleus .",

    "the implied x - ray - to - optical flux ratios , @xmath27 15.8 , are larger than for stars , normal galaxies , and agn ( maccacaro et al . 1988 ) .",
    "the acis spectra of the serendipitous sources exhibit spectral cutoffs below @xmath0 0.81 kev , consistent with column densities n@xmath28 .",
    "these columns are consistent within their large uncertainties with the galactic value in the direction to , n@xmath29 ( freeman et al . 1977 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra are generally hard ( hr @xmath1 2 , table 2 ) , and inspection of the spectra shows that strong emission lines ( ew @xmath0 a few hundred ev ) are present in the brightest sources at both soft and hard x - rays , indicating emission from ionized ne , si , s , arg , and fe .",
    "short - term ( @xmath0 13 hours ) flux variability is also observed in several cases ; remarkably , source # 8 shows periods of total flux occultation every @xmath0 20 ks .",

    ", several bright x - ray sources ( most likely x - ray binaries or ultra - luminous snrs associated with the galaxy itself ) are detected within several arcsec from the nucleus , as well as diffuse ionized / cold gas , on scales as large as 20(400 pc ) , contributing to various degrees to the x - ray emission .",
    "we find that at the softer energies , the x - ray emission is equally contributed to by the unresolved nucleus ( i.e. , 0.8  or 15 pc ) / and by an extended emission on       scales @xmath0 2  or 38 pc . at harder x - rays ( 2 kev ) ,",
