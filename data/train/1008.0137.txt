    "2007 ) reported a systemic heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath22  km  s@xmath18 , with an internal dispersion of @xmath23  km  s@xmath18 , for botes  i. the histogram of our radial velocities is given in figure  [ fig : boo_vels ] , with the local maximum at around 100  km  s@xmath18 being due to members of botes  i. with random errors of the radial velocities of @xmath21  km  s@xmath18 , our data are clearly incapable of resolving the internal kinematics of botes  i. ( our wide - field observations were designed to identify candidate radial - velocity members out to large distances on the sky for abundance study . ) botes  i , at 65  kpc , is sufficiently distant that interloper giant stars from the smooth stellar halo are unexpected , but field main sequence stars could contaminate our candidate members of botes  i. the line - of - sight is towards galactic latitude @xmath24 , so that all galactic components will have a mean velocity close to zero .",

    "thus with our sample size of 122 stars , we expect of order eight galactic stars at high positive velocities .",
    "the besanon model predictions are indicated in figure  [ fig : boo_vels ] and provide a satisfactory match to the distribution at lower velocities .",
    "the extra peak due to the presence of botes  i is quite pronounced ; the thin vertical dotted lines indicate the bin edges that contain our velocity range for candidate radial - velocity members , @xmath27  ( km  s@xmath18 ) @xmath28 ( the bin edges are 80  km  s@xmath18 and 140  km  s@xmath18 and there are no other stars with velocities in these bins ) .",

    "it is apparent from this figure that we identify radial - velocity members well beyond the nominal half - light radius .",
    "the outer parts of botes  i will likely be more susceptible to field contamination , and we can investigate this by testing the observed distribution of velocities at distant projected locations against a gaussian , representing the field galaxy with no superposed dwarf galaxy .",
    "there are 56 stars that are more distant than 35 ( 2.7 half - light radii , or 4.5 exponential scale - lengths ) from the center of botes  i , where there is a gap in the distribution of candidate members in figure  [ fig : boo_vel_rad ] .",
    "these stars have a velocity distribution that is in fact well - represented by a gaussian , with mean velocity of @xmath31  km  s@xmath18 and dispersion of 75  km  s@xmath18 ( not dissimilar to the besanon predictions ) . adopting this gaussian model ,",
    "we calculate the fraction of these stars which would lie by chance in the velocity interval @xmath32  km  s@xmath18 ( our selection for members of botes  i ) to be 7% , or four stars out of our 56 .",
    "the number of candidate radial - velocity members of botes  i in this range of parameter space is six .",

    "repeating the fit to a gaussian for the stars projected within the inner 35  , and fitting only to stars outside the nominal velocity membership range , predicts three contaminating field stars in the list of 30 candidate members .",

    "simply extrapolating that decline under the velocity range of segue  1 is an uncertain process , but suggests that up to four of the nine candidates could be field contaminants . given the complexity of the local field , and the possible similarity of kinematics between segue  1 , some part of the sgr streams , and possibly the nearby orphan stream ( belokurov et al .",
    "2007 ) , no robust _ ab initio _ spatial distribution model is available to motivate a joint position - velocity membership criterion ( see niederste - ostholt et al .",

    "persson et al.(1980 , their figure 5 ) first established that this cluster is unique among galactic globular clusters in possessing a sub - population of some 10% of its red giants that have strong enhancements of their near infrared co bands , which is not seen in any other cluster ( see nd , section  5.3 ) .",
    "as demonstrated by nd ( and shown in our figure  [ fig:[c / fe]_mv](d ) , where co - strong and co - weak objects are represented by filled and open circles , respectively ) the sub - sample of co - strong objects has significantly larger carbon abundances than that of the co - weak objects .",
    "we emphasize that no significant fraction of similar co - strong objects exists in other clusters .",
    "more to the point , to our knowledge no satisfactory explanation exists for this co - strong sub - population in @xmath14  cen . ]      the above caveats concerning evolutionary mixing effects notwithstanding , consideration of figure  [ fig:[c / fe]_[fe / h ] ] and the upper two panels of figure  [ fig:[c / fe]_mv ] suggests a strong similarity between the carbon abundance distributions of the red giants of the galaxy s dwarf galaxies and halo . at first glance",
    "it might also appear that the available data for the brighter giants in @xmath14  cen share this similarity .",
    "given , however , the biased nature of the nd sample introduced by their selection towards the chemical extremes of the cluster , such a conclusion would be premature .",
    "all one can say is that at least some stars in @xmath14  cen show abundance patterns like those of the halo and botes  i.    if one accepts that the carbon abundance signatures of the galaxy s dwarf galaxies and halo are essentially the same , and the conclusion of spite et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that giants with [ fe / h ] @xmath0 2.5 comprise `` mixed '' and `` unmixed '' stars , with the `` unmixed '' group `` reflecting the abundances of the early galaxy '' , one might suggest this could well apply also to the ultra - faint dwarfs .",
    "the hypothesis is testable . according to spite et al .",
    "( 2005 , see their figures 68 ) the `` mixed '' stars have low c and high n ( consistent with dredge up of cno processed material ) , together with strong li dilution , while the `` unmixed '' objects show no evidence for c to n conversion , and only moderate li depletion . more data to determine nitrogen and lithium abundances in the dwarf galaxies are clearly needed to address the question .    regardless of whether or not the abundances have been modified by stellar evolutionary effects , the data in the upper panel of figure  [ fig:[c / fe]_[fe / h ] ] show that the present relative carbon abundances [ c / fe ] of stars in the galaxy s ultra - faint dwarf satellites are similar to those of stars in its halo , and in the range 3.5 @xmath4 [ fe / h ] @xmath4 2.5 has the value [ c / fe ] @xmath3 0.3 .",
    "accurate iron abundances are now available for 16 radial - velocity candidate members of botes  i , and if we restrict this to those within 2.5r@xmath17 ( at which radius , adopting the surface brightness of martin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the probability of membership is 0.20 of its value at r@xmath17 ) , this number decreases to 15 .",
    "the outlier , boo980 , lies at 3.9r@xmath17 and has [ fe / h ] = 3.1 , rather suggestive of membership .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig : mdf ] then present the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) ( left panel ) and the dependence of [ fe / h ] versus elliptical radius ( right panel ) for all 16 botes  i stars , while the lower panels show the results for galactic dsph systems and @xmath14  cen ( where , for the latter , radial distance is employed in the right panel ) . to improve their formal accuracy , we replaced the botes  i aaomega abundances for boo7 , 121 , and 911 presented in table  3 , for which we have no high - resolution abundances , with values from feltzing et al .  ( 2009 ) values remain essentially unchanged ( 2.28 vs 2.32 ) , ( 2.39 , 2.37 ) , and ( 2.21 , 1.98 ) for boo7 , 121 , and 911 , respectively , while the error bars decrease . ] .",
    "there are three points to note about botes  i. first , in comparison with the steep rise in the mdf seen in @xmath14  cen between [ fe / h ] = 2.2 and 1.8 , its mdf has a slow increase from lowest abundance to the mdf peak , covering [ fe / h ] = 3.7 to 2.3 , similar to that seen in the dsphs , with recent dsph abundance results only accentuating the low metallicity tails to their mdfs ; second , of the dsph systems with published data for individual stars , it has the highest percentage of objects with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 3.0 ; and third , while there are too few objects to permit a strong statement , it appears to have a ( marginally significant with these data ) radial abundance gradient .",
    "such a gradient is seen in some of the other dsph systems , as reported by winnick ( 2003 ) , tolstoy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and koch et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "we noted in section  1 that geha et al .",
    "( 2009 ) provided the first spectroscopic abundance estimate for segue  1 .",
    "they analyzed a single radial - velocity member ( their star 3451364 , with velocity 215.6  km  s@xmath18 , 9.5  km  s@xmath18 larger than the systemic velocity ) , and assuming it to be a red giant reported [ fe / h ] = 3.3 @xmath33 0.2 , based on spectrum synthesis in the cat wavelength ( @xmath3 83008700   ) region .",
    "as discussed in sections 46 , we have three objects with reliable abundances and radial velocities consistent with membership of the segue  1 system , and one other velocity candidate ( seg  198 ) with inconsistent blue and red abundance estimates . of these four stars ,",
    "two ( seg  131 and seg  171 ) are relatively metal rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath32.0 ) , while the c - rich star seg  17 is extremely metal - poor , with [ fe / h ] = 3.5 .",
    "these four velocity member stars may still , statistically , include a chance non - member .",
    "it is thus probable , but not certain , that there exists a large [ fe / h ] range in the segue  1 system .",
    "clearly , four objects are too few to say much about the mdf , other than to reiterate our earlier statement that this system , at face value , is not monometallic .",
    "additionally , there remains the open question of whether we are looking at an ultra - faint dwarf ( geha et al .",

    "first , for @xmath14  cen norris and da costa ( 1995 ) and pancino et al .  (",
    "2002 ) showed that [ ca / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] is well - determined and follows the galactic halo relationship , permitting one to transform the published values of [ ca / h ] to [ fe / h ] using the relationship of the galactic halo .",
    "second , concerning the use of the ca triplet to determine [ fe / h ] for sextans , carina , umi , and draco we recall that the data of battaglia et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , obtained for fornax and sculptor using the same technique , show that the ca ii triplet and higher resolution spectroscopy yield the same values of @xmath67([fe / h ] ) , to within 0.04  somewhat surprisingly to us , given their non - galactic halo [ ca / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relationships . ] . in determining uncertainties in the abundance dispersions",
    ", we followed the precepts of da costa et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , which explicitly remove the effects of instrumental and statistical abundance errors in the determination of dispersion .",
    "for botes  i , we used the data in table  3 , to which we assign measurement errors of 0.15 dex for the ten high - resolution analyses ( including the three feltzing et al .",
    "( 2009 ) stars discussed in section 7.1 ) , on the one hand , and 0.35 dex for the six remaining aaomega - based result , on the other , while for the segue  1 objects we adopted @xmath2[fe / h ] = 0.4 dex for seg  131 and seg  171 ) and 0.2 dex for the geha et al .",
    "red giant and seg  17 . for the other systems we assumed abundance errors of 0.2 dex for the ultra - faint dwarfs , umi , and draco ( based on error estimates in kirby et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and data of winnick ( 2003 ) ) , and 0.10 dex for the other dsphs and @xmath14  cen ( following battaglia et al .",

    "figure  [ fig : sigfe_vs_mv ] presents mean metallicities and dispersions about the mean as a function of integrated absolute visual magnitude m@xmath11 .",
    "inspection of the figure shows the continued decrease in mean [ fe / h ] as one proceeds to lower absolute magnitude , first reported by kirby et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , together with an apparent increase in the abundance dispersion .",
    "whether or not this trend continues to the luminosity of segue  1 is uncertain , being sensitive to membership assignments .",
    "the two segue  1 stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath3 2 . may be field interlopers .",
    "the two very metal - poor stars are offset in either velocity ( seg  13451364 ) or position ( seg  17 ) from the reported systemic values .",
    "more data are clearly required for segue  1 to test this suggestion more rigorously .",
    "that said , an increased abundance spread is intuitively consistent with inhomogeneous stochastic enrichment in very low - baryonic - mass and low - metallicity systems , enriched by very few supernova events .",
    "seg  17 has a spectrum that is similar to those of the c - rich , extremely - metal poor stars of the galactic halo .",
    "as emphasized above , more work is needed to investigate the possible connection between the parent populations of the galaxy s dwarf satellites and halo .",
    "the question is an important one for an understanding of chemical enrichment at the very earliest times .",
    "as one proceeds to lowest abundance in the galactic halo ( i.e. to the oldest stars ) one finds that the fraction of c - rich objects increases  indeed all stars to date with [ fe / h ] @xmath0 4.3 are c - rich ( see e.g. norris et al.2007 ) .",
    "further , efforts to understand the intriguing relative abundance distributions of c - rich stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath0 3.5 , many of which are characterized by enhanced values of some , or all , of [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] , [ o / fe ] , and [ mg / fe ] of order 12 dex , have led to the proposal of severely non - canonical supernovae at the earliest times and lowest metallicities , involving for example `` mixing and fallback '' during explosion ( see iwamoto et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) . while it has been proposed that the elemental abundances of the most metal - poor stars in the field halo can be explained by the explosions of zero - metallicity massive stars with a salpeter imf over the range 1540m@xmath44 ( joggerst et al .",
    "2010 ) , we note that these objects do not produce the extreme cno abundances of a significant fraction of cemp stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 3.5 .",
    "if more exotic supernovae are a natural feature of the evolution of extremely metal - poor massive stars , they may have also left their signatures in the lowest abundance stars within the ultra - faint systems .",
    "the primary conclusion of our investigation is that the spread of carbon abundance in both botes  i and segue  1 is large . for botes",
    "i , four of the 16 objects in table  3 have [ c / h ] @xmath0 3.1 , while two have [ c / h ] @xmath1 2.3 , suggesting a range of @xmath2[c / h ] @xmath3 0.8 . in table  4 one",
    "finds that for segue  1 there exists a range @xmath2[c / h ]  @xmath3  1.0 .",
    "( for iron , the accompanying ranges are @xmath2[fe / h ]  @xmath3  1.6 for both botes  i and segue  1 . )",
    "a related result is that for [ fe / h ] @xmath4 3.0 the milky way s dwarf satellites exhibit a dependence of [ c / fe ] on [ fe / h ] that is very similar to that observed for the galaxy s halo .",
    "we find [ c / fe ]  @xmath3 0.3 for stars in the ultra - faint systems that we believe are the counterpart of the spite et al .",
    "( 2005 ) `` unmixed '' giants of the galactic halo and for which they report [ c / fe ]  @xmath3  0.2 . of particlar interest is that the segue  1 system contains an extremely metal - poor , carbon - rich star , with [ fe / h ] = 3.5 , [ c / fe ] = + 2.3 .",
    "the second conclusion is confirmation of the correlation between ( decreasing ) luminosity and ( decreasing ) mean metallicity in dwarf galaxies , figure  [ fig : sigfe_vs_mv ] .",
    "this luminosity - metallicity correlation is consistent with models of a mass - metallicity relation in which system mass ( predominantly dark matter ) provides the potential well to ( at least partially ) retain supernova ejecta , while the supernova rate is never so high that it evacuates all the remaining gas before further star formation can happen  that is , self - limiting star formation with steady gas loss .",
    "it is also consistent with models where there is no system mass - metallicity relation , where all ( dark matter ) potential wells are similar , and the wide range of surviving luminosities depends on a gas - loss rate driven by very different star formation rates , in the extreme cases implying a very short duration of star formation before system gas loss . consideration of the dispersion in stellar abundances and in stellar abundance ratios is necessary to quantify the efficiency of mixing of enrichment , and the number of supernovae whose ejecta were retained during continuing star formation .",
    "the first model is consistent with stellar abundances reflecting enrichment by the mixed ejecta of many supernovae , the second predicts substantial star to star scatter in enrichment patterns .",
    "more fundamentally , the existence of this relation shows that the observed dwarfs are not drastically stripped remnants of initially more luminous systems , which by the luminosity - metallicity relation , would have been more metal - rich .",
    "this robust conclusion is surprising , as generic hierarchical galaxy formation models require that the few dwarf galaxies that are currently found within the inner halo of the milky way should be short - lived debris near final disruption , from an initally much more luminous state .",
    "the continuation of this relation to luminosities below that of botes  i remains to be proven .",
    "the available data are equally consistent with a correlation continuing down to segue  1 , at m@xmath5 = 2 , and a correlation flattening at the luminosity of botes  i , m@xmath5 = 6 .",
    "the other clear feature of the metallicity distribution functions shown in figure  [ fig : mdf ] is the special status of @xmath14  cen , which is unique in not having a tail of stars to very low metallicity .",
    "the simplest explanation of this is that it formed from gas that had been substantially pre - enriched prior to its own formation , which is not the case for any known dsph galaxy .",
    "this argues strongly against the hypothesis that @xmath14  cen is the surviving remnant / core of the bulk of a dsph parent , but rather argues that @xmath14  cen is a luminous star cluster .",
    "( a similar situation may also pertain to the globular cluster m54 and the bulk of the disintegrating sgr dsph . )",
    "the essential difference between dsphs and @xmath14  cen is most likely that for the former it was primarily dark matter that facilitated self enrichment from material having very low initial abundance , while proto-@xmath14  cen contained sufficient baryonic mass to retain some stellar ejecta and so host later generations of star formation ( perhaps within a larger parent containing dark matter which had experienced some chemical evolution and provided the pre - enrichment ) .      the nature of segue  1 remains the subject of active discussion : while geha et al .",
    "( 2009 ) identify it as an ultra - faint dwarf galaxy , niederste - ostholt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest that it is probably a disrupted system , perhaps initially a star cluster , associated with the sagittarius galaxy .",
    "this latter identification was made on the basis of the complex system morphology , combined with the likelihood that interlopers from the sgr stream both contaminate the abundance distribution function , and , if present , would inflate the derived velocity dispersion of segue  1 and contribute to an ( erroneous ) identification as an ultra - faint galaxy . in this study",
    "we do not contribute to the kinematic analysis usefully .",
    "what of our abundances ?",
    "our results are summarized in table 4 , and discussed above .",
    "we have two radial - velocity candidate members with [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xmath71 , and two with [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xmath72 , one of which has a somewhat offset velocity ( by @xmath310  km  s@xmath18 from the systemic value ) , the other with a somewhat offset spatial position ( by 17 from galaxy center ) .",
    "we must allow for the possibility of significant contamination of our sample .",
    "this unsatisfactory data set allows three possible options .",
    "( 1 ) at least three of the four stars are system members . in that case segue  1",
    "indeed has a broad range of iron abundances , comparable to that seen in the more luminous dsphs , and a `` mean '' abundance , insofar as a patently bimodal distribution function can be so characterized , implying that segue  1 is ( or was ) embedded in a sufficiently massive ( dark ) halo to retain supernova ejecta , and self - enrich . that is to say , segue  1 was , and",
    "may still be , an ultra - faint galaxy ; ( 2 ) the two most metal - poor stars , including the carbon - rich star , are contaminants from the sgr dwarf . in this case segue  1",
    "has no detected metallicity dispersion , has mean metallicity similar to that of other sgr globular clusters , and segue  1 is another sgr star cluster .",
    "the two extremely metal - poor stars then require separate explanation .",
    "( 3 ) the two most metal - rich stars , which have abundances similar to those of member stars in the sgr dwarf , are interlopers , with abundances similar to those of other sgr debris . in this case segue  1",
    "is an extremely metal - poor star cluster embedded in sgr debris .",
    "each possibility is interesting .",
    "statistically , given the rarity of extremely metal - poor carbon - enhanced stars , we slightly favor option ( 1 ) , that segue  1 is indeed an exceptionally low - luminosity galaxy , whose abundances suggest it is the lowest luminosity , most primitive dwarf galaxy yet discovered .",
    "( to us , possibility ( 2 ) , that both extremely metal - poor stars are interlopers from a relatively metal - richer sgr seems unlikely , given their rarity , while ( 3 ) , that we are dealing with a star cluster of very low mass ( @xmath3  1000m@xmath8 , martin et al .",
    "2008 ) , raises questions concerning the survival of the system against disruption . ) the apparent bimodal abundance distribution , if it survives larger data sets , suggests a very low star formation rate at early times , perhaps even with a pause after formation of the early stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath3 3.5 ( including the carbon - rich object ) and/or extremely inhomogeneous mixing of ejecta in the local ism .",
    "the implied low star formation rate is also consistent with survival of segue  1 as a system with continuing gas retention .",
    "it is probable that segue  1 is associated with sgr , rather than that it is an isolated system , so that segue  1 is a sub - halo of sgr , and hence has recently become a sub - sub - halo of the milky way .",
    "the extremely low representative metallicity of segue  1 is consistent with it being an extremely early system , with its earliest surviving stars showing an element pattern suggesting enrichment by the first generation of near zero - metal supernovae .",
    "the consistency of segue  1 with a continuous luminosity - metallicity relation argues strongly that segue  1 has always been an ultra low - luminosity system .",
    "it is not tidal debris from an initially much more luminous system .",
