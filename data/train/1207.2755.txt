    "quantum entanglement@xcite is an important aspect of quantum mechanics that tells us about the quantum correlation of two particles or subsystems spatially apart .",
    "when a composite quantum system is in a pure non - product state , then even if the subsystems are spatially far apart and non - interacting , the measurement on one subsystem affects that on the other instantaneously .",
    "this `` spooky action at a distance '' later gave birth to the term `` entanglement '' .",
    "this phenomenon was first marked by einstein , podolsky and rosen in a gedanken experiment@xcite , known as the epr paradox . in their paper , they considered two particles which interacted for some time and showed that it is possible to measure the conjugate non - commutating quantities , like position and momentum , simultaneously , in violation of quantum mechanics . later on , it was resolved and resulted the idea of the quantum entanglement which indicates the presence of inherent quantum effects , not just correlations between the two particles . in fact , quantum entanglement is a resource for quantum computation with no classical counter - part . here , in this paper , we consider two interacting particles in a pure state , like an epr pair , or more specifically in the two - particle ground state , in which case we can expect to observe the entanglement .",
    "a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) occurs at zero temperature and at the qpt the ground state energy is non - analytic with respect to some parameter in the hamiltonian .",
    "a qpt is fully governed by quantum fluctuations and hence one would expect that the quantum entanglement would show special signatures at the qpt . even it is found that the entanglement entropy behaves in different ways for a first order and a continuous transition .",
    "the critical behaviour of the entanglement entropy is drawing much attention now - a - days@xcite and has been investigated for different spin models @xcite as well as in continuum systems@xcite .    to quantify the entanglement , various definitions of entanglement entropy",
    "are used , among which the von neumann entropy@xcite is the most common .",
    "recently it was shown that the von neumann entropy of two particles has a @xmath5 behaviour at the quantum critical point ( qcp ) of unbinding in dimensions .",
    "this has been established analytically for a @xmath6d potential well@xcite . here",
    "the qcp is attained when the inverse length scale @xmath7 , the inverse of the width of the wave function , approaches zero .",
    "this is achieved by tuning the potential or the mass .",
    "also it is shown that this divergence is essential for the criticality and linked to the reunion behaviour of two polymers in the equivalent classical statistical mechanical problem of polymers . in this paper , we study how the von neumann entropy for a long - range potential , like @xmath8 , changes as one varies its strength and sign .",
    "the equivalent classical statistical mechanical problem involves two directed polymers interacting at the same contour length like a dna with native base pairing but with an additional @xmath8 interaction .",
    "the polymer model has been studied using renormalization group in ref.@xcite .",
    "this paper considers two particles interacting through a three - dimensional inverse square law potential , and finds the quantum entanglement between the particles .",
    "here we use particle partitioning@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two particles we shall be using is , @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass , the position and the momentum of the @xmath13th particle , @xmath14 is a central potential , and @xmath15 is the reduced mass of the two particles .",

    "for an attractive potential @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , the kinetic and the potential energies are of the same order near small @xmath22 and so the bound state spectrum depends on the value of @xmath23 .",
    "a manifestation of the borderline case is in the scale - free nature , @xmath24 .",
    "this makes , @xmath23 , the dimensionless strength of the potential , a `` marginal '' parameter in the rg sense in all dimensions .",
    "the singularity of @xmath25 at the origin prevents discrete bound states . a suitable modification of the potential at small @xmath22 , e.g. by putting a cut off and replacing the potential by a short range finite attraction near origin , gives discrete bound states",

    "the unbinding transition is induced by tuning the strength of the short - range potential near @xmath28 , depicting the quantum phase transition .",
    "the unbinding transition in this long - range interaction is a unique example of a qpt whose type can be first order ( @xmath2 ) , critical but non - universal ( @xmath29 ) , and even kosterlitz - thouless type ( @xmath30)@xcite . the solvability and the wide repertoire of qpt behaviour make this model an ideal terrain for exploration of the nature of entanglement entropy around a qpt belongs to a space @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the hilbert space for a free particle while @xmath33 is the separable space of square integrable functions .",

    "the time in the quantum problem then becomes the length of the polymer , @xmath38 , green s function maps on to the partition function and the ground state energy corresponds to the free energy per unit length .",
