    "the shape of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and whether it is universal or not are key issues in astrophysics . for clusters within 2 kpc , there is no compelling evidence for variations in the stellar imf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus , we are forced to observe more extreme regions of star formation in search of variations in the imf as a function of environment .",
    "it has been suggested that the shape of the imf and in particular the characteristic mass where the imf flattens from a salpeter power ",
    "law could depend on the metallicity in the molecular cloud out of which the stars are formed .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest that a lower metallicity results in higher temperatures in the molecular cloud which would increase the jeans mass . this would in turn result in a top heavy imf relative to the solar metallicity imf .    the closest place with massive metal ",

    "the cluster has a mass of at least 2.2@xmath6 m@xmath2 within a radius of 4.7 pc @xcite and is a relatively low - mass analog to the more distant starburst clusters .",
    "r136 lies at the center of the 30 dor cluster and has long commanded significant attention : once thought to be a single @xmath11000 m@xmath2 star @xcite , the region is now known to host numerous o stars @xcite .",
    "the whole 30 dor region , with a size of 200 pc , appears to have an age spread of @xmath120 myr @xcite with stars still forming @xcite .",
    "r136 appears to have a much smaller age spread of at most a few myr @xcite .",
    "an age of 2 myr or less is inferred from spectroscopy of the o stars in the very cluster center @xcite , whereas the intermediate mass population is thought to be @xmath134 myr old @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained hst spectroscopy of the 65 bluest and most luminous sources within 17  of the cluster center .",

    "the imf derived for different annuli out to a radius of 4.7 pc was found to be in the range @xmath9 for the mass range 2.815 m@xmath2 , again consistent with a salpeter slope imf .",
    "@xcite combined their results for the high  mass imf with the results from @xcite in order to constrain the imf from 2.8 m@xmath2 up to 120 m@xmath2 . comparing the number of high  mass stars predicted by the intermediate ",

    "source detection was done using daofind and photometry was performed via point spread function ( psf ) photometry utilizing allstar within the iraf environment .",
    "it was difficult to obtain a good psf model from the data due to the high degree of crowding and the spatial variability of the psf .",
    "instead , the tinytim software @xcite was used to create a synthetic psf .",
    "tinytim allows to create a psf that varies as a function of the location on the array .",
    "the source detection and photometry was performed on each individual position in the mosaic due to the linearly varying point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "a hot template star ( o5v ) was used for the spectral energy distribution in order to achieve the best fit for the brightest stars to limit their residuals .",
    "the tinytim psf was created for five different positions on the nicmos camera 2 array and the psfs were placed in an empty frame with the same number of pixels as the nicmos camera 2 array .",
    "four frames were created with offsets between each psf identical to the offsets used for the science data in order to replicate the data as closely as possible .",
    "the four psf frames were then combined using drizzle together in the same manner as the science data and a linearly  varying psf was created from the drizzled frame .",
    "source detection is complicated due to the diffraction features present in nicmos data .",
    "adoption of a low threshold for source detection led to numerous diffraction spots from bright stars being erroneously identified as fainter stars .",
    "instead the source detection was done in the following way in order to limit false detections .",
    "we first detected the brightest stars ( brighter than 1000@xmath16 ) in each frame and used allstar to remove these with the synthetic psf .",
    "a search for fainter stars ( brighter than 500@xmath16 ) was then performed in the frame with the bright stars removed .",
    "since the removal of the brightest stars also removed the diffraction pattern associated with them , we did not detect the diffraction spots as stars .",
    "the two star lists ( the brightest stars and the fainter stars ) were joined into one and these stars were removed from the original frame , again using allstar .",
    "fainter stars are then found from the frame with the already detected stars removed .",
    "this process was iterated until stars at 10 @xmath16 peak pixel intensity over the background were detected and removed .",

    "median filtered to remove stellar residuals but to retain the large - scale nebulosity in each frame .",
    "the median  filtered image was then removed from the original frame and the star detection process was repeated in this frame but now continued to a detection threshold of 5@xmath16 .",
    "a 5@xmath16 instead of e.g. a 3@xmath16 threshold was selected to limit the risks of false detections due to noise spikes .",
    "we finally made sure by visual inspection that every detection indeed was a point source and that it was not a spurious detection due to the diffraction spikes and spots from bright stars .",
    "the main interest here is in the low  mass ( faint ) stellar content in r136 and one concern is the detection of residuals from the bright stars as false stellar objects .",
    "some false sources were detected by daofind but are rejected during the psf fitting routine .",
    "a few remained from the brightest stars .",
    "they typically produced at most a few false detections in the diffraction spikes that were @xmath167 mag fainter than the bright source .",
    "we removed these detections together with other false detection through the visual inspection of all sources .",
    "we have further utilized the artificial star experiments described below to examine how many detections are false due to the residuals from bright stars .",
    "we had only false positives associated with the brightest artificial stars ( @xmath17 12 mag ) .",
    "for artificial stars fainter than @xmath18 mag , no false detections were present .",
    "the false detections for the bright stars were located at the diffraction spikes and would have been identified in the manual inspection of the source list .",

    "we are mainly interested in the low - mass stellar content of the cluster , which is below the 50%  completeness in the central parts . the uncertainty in the completeness corrections for the inner parts of the cluster will therefore not affect the conclusions drawn for the stellar populations further out .",

    "most of the stars detected by the nicmos survey but not the wfpc2 observations are fainter than @xmath24 20 mag . assuming an object age of 3 myr and an average extinction of a@xmath15 mag ( see below ) , the similar object would have a magnitude in the band of @xmath122 mag . for objects with more extinction , they will be even harder to detect in the band .",

    "only 1 in 4 stars in the magnitude interval = 2122 mag was detected outside 1 pc .",
    "it is thus not surprising that a significant population of faint stars are detected in the nicmos survey relative to the wfpc2 survey . nevertheless , the lower spatial resolution of the nicmos observations results in a low recovery fraction at these magnitudes in the central few pc of the cluster .    the majority of the sources not detected in the nicmos survey but at optical wavelengths are located within a radius of 1 pc .",
    "the lack of detection is due to the lower spatial resolution in this study relative to the optical hst data .",
    "the resolution is almost a factor of two better in the band than in the band .",
    "sources not detected in the nicmos data outside 1 pc are mainly due to crowding as well .",

    "it is evident that the clustering around the isochrone is tighter than for the   versus  color magnitude diagram .",
    "this is expected if a large part of the scatter is due to differential extinction .",
    "we can calculate the scatter around the main sequence in both color  magnitude diagrams and compare with the difference predicted from extinction .",
    "if the spread in the color  magnitude diagrams is due to extinction we expect the ratio of spread in the   versus  diagram to be ratio of the extinction in each color , i.e. @xmath26 times larger than in the   versus  color  magnitude diagram .",
    "since the isochrone is almost vertical in both diagrams , we have calculated the standard deviation around the reddened isochrone in both color  magnitude diagrams .",
    "we have used the stars with good photometry , better than 5%  in each filter , and in the magnitude range @xmath27mag .",
    "the standard deviation found for the   and    color  magnitude diagrams are 0.60 mag , and 0.36 mag and the ratio is 1.7 .",
    "if the measurement errors are taken into account this ratio increases .",
    "the typical errors for the culled sample are 0.04 , 0.02 , and 0.03 mag for the v , i , and  bands , respectively . after taking the measurement errors into account ,",
    "the ratio is found to be 1.9 , assuming the measurement errors in two filters are independent . due to blending , this is not necessarily the case .",
    "thus , 1.9 is an upper limit and we thus find the ratio to be between 1.7 and 1.9 , in agreement with the scatter being due to differential extinction .    since the amount of differential extinction does not affect the  band photometry significantly , the single band photometry presented here is competitive with the 2band optical photometry .",
    "there is a unique translation from the  band magnitude to the object mass for the majority of the mass range . for the optical photometry",
    ", the color information is used to determine the extinction and the mass function is thus effectively determined by the de  reddened band magnitude .",
    "the main advantage of the optical relative to the near  infrared hst photometry is the improved resolution due to the smaller diffraction limit .",
    "the stellar content can therefore be resolved to lower masses closer to the cluster core than is possible with the near  infrared observations .",
    "however , phenomena associated with the star formation process can introduce additional reddening that can complicate the derivation of the low ",
    "mass imf from optical data .",
    "mass objects may still be associated with a circumstellar disk .",
    "there is evidence from e.g. the orion nebula cluster that circumstellar disks can survive the uv radiation from massive stars @xcite .",
    "even if the disks are being evaporated by the ration field from the early type stars , the evaporated material will be a further source of reddening .",
    "patchy extinction associated with the 30 dor complex and located in the foreground of r 136 will be an additional source of differential reddening .",
    "there are signs in the optical images presented in fig . 1 of @xcite of patches of extinction , e.g. to the east  north  east of the cluster center .",
    "if variable extinction is present or if a significant fraction of the stars are associated with disks or outflows , an extinction limited sample has to be created in order to avoid a biases against detection of the low  mass stars .",
    "the near  infrared photometry is effected by differential extinction as well but the effect is less than 20% of that measured in the band . thus , whereas the imf derived from optical observations where an extinction limited sample is not defined might be severely affected for the low ",
    "mass objects , the effect on near  infrared observations is modest",
    ". therefore , in the outer parts of the cluster where crowding is a smaller issue than closer to the center , the near  infrared observations are more suitable to detect and characterise the low  mass stellar population in the cluster .",
    "on the other hand , single band photometry has the disadvantage that there is no information on the age of individual objects .",
    "we investigate in the next section how this might affect the derived imf .",
    "we note that if differential extinction is present , the situation is no better for the optical photometry .",
    "even though the cluster was observed through two filters in the optical , there is still a degeneracy between age and extinction .",

    "this region is limited to masses below 1.7 m@xmath2 for the 3 myr isochrone .",
    "it is therefore only for the 57 pc annulus that a reasonable mass range is covered to fit the imf .",
    "we find the slope to be @xmath36 , which is more shallow but consistent at the 2@xmath16 level with a salpeter imf and is consistent with the slope derived for the full mass range .",

    "although shown in section 3.2 that this scatter can be explained by differential extinction , it can not be ruled out that there is an age spread present as well as suggested in previous studies @xcite .",

    "we find that both in the case of a 2 and 4 myr isochrone the imf is well fit by power",
    "the derived slopes are steeper assuming an older isochrone relative to the younger ones .",
    "there is no indication for a flattening below 2 m@xmath2 in either case .",

    "for the average imf , the number of stars averaged over the different ages in each mass bin is derived .",
    "error bars for the average imf have been determined as the standard deviation around the mean number of objects in each mass bin .",
    "as was the case for the 3 myr isochrone , the slopes of the imf for different assumed ages have also been calculated and are provided in table  [ slopes ] .",
    "the slopes are found to be shallower than a salpeter slope , but at the @xmath37 level consistent with a salpeter slope .",
    "the slopes are also consistent with those derived for all masses up to 20 m@xmath2 , as was the case assuming the 3 myr isochrone .",
    "the lack of a flattening in the imf below 2 m@xmath2 is in contrast to the results presented by @xcite , who derived the imf closer to the cluster center .",
    "there can be several possible reasons for the difference in the derived imf slope in the two surveys .",
    "first , due to the different spatial resolution in the two studies , the nicmos imf is derived further away from the center of the cluster than the wfpc2 imf by @xcite .",
    "the imf was derived in the areas shown in fig .",
    "[ 30dormos ] as regions b , c , and d. thus , all of their surveyed area is outside a radius of 1 pc and the majority of their surveyed area is between 2 and 5 pc where crowding precludes nicmos from detecting stars less massive than 2.2 m@xmath2 for a 3 myr isochrone .",
    "one possibility for the difference in the derived slopes for the nicmos and wfpc2 data can therefore be a variation of the imf as a function of radius .",
    "another possible reason can be differential extinction as suggested by @xcite .",
    "both possibilities are discussed in subsections 4.2 and 4.3      as was suggested by @xcite , the presence of differential extinction can potentially alter the low  mass end of the imf if an extinction - limited sample is not used . in order to estimate the possible effect on the imf if differential extinction is not taken into account , we have constructed a simple model of the cluster which includes differential extinction and the depth of the dataset from @xcite . a salpeter slope imf and a cluster age of 3 myr were assumed .",
    "each object within the artificial cluster was assigned a band magnitude based on its mass from the 3 myr isochrone computed for a half solar metallicity by @xcite .",
    "the objects were then reddened by a foreground extinction chosen randomly from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.7 and shifted to peak at a@xmath38=1.85 mag . if the extinction was found to be less than a@xmath12 mag , a new extinction was calculated .",
    "stars were then considered detected if their reddened magnitude is within the 50%  completeness limit presented by @xcite .",
    "the model is obviously an oversimplification of the real situation .",
    "nevertheless it is expected to illustrate how the derived imf might differ from the underlying imf .",
    "figure  [ checksirianni ] shows the input salpeter imf ( solid line ) , the derived imf ( dashed line ) together with the measurements by @xcite .",
    "the model mimics a flattening in the observed imf similar to that deduced by @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the number of stars below and above 2 m@xmath2 respectively has been calculated both for the model cluster and the data from @xcite . for the model cluster",
    "it is found to be 0.87 , which is in reasonable agreement with the ratio of 0.76 derived from the observations .",
    "another explanation for the difference between the results obtained here and the results by @xcite can be mass segregation .",
    "we have searched for evidence for mass segregation in the two outer annuli in our survey .",
    "we used the luminosity functions instead of the mass functions to avoid additional uncertainties due to the mass  luminosity relation .",
    "the results obtained for the mass functions are very similar to those from the luminosity functions .",
    "the cumulative luminosity distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ cumu_lf ] for the outer two radial bins .",
    "these are the only bins where the 50% completeness limit is below 2 m@xmath2 .",
    "the two cumulative distributions are very similar .",
    "we have performed a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test to quantify the similarity of the cumulative luminosity distributions .",
    "the maximum difference between the two distributions is 0.039 and the probability for the two distributions to be drawn from the same parent distribution is 10% .",
    "thus , there is no strong evidence ( less than 2@xmath16 ) for mass segregation in the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "the fact that there is little evidence for mass segregation outside 3 pc does not exclude the possibility that the cluster is mass segregated out to a radius of several pc .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found evidence for mass segregation of the massive stars in the center of the cluster .",
    "@xcite showed the half ",
    "mass relaxation time to be 7.8@xmath39 yr , much longer than the cluster age .",
    "they also point out that the massive stars will experience mass segregation on a much shorter time scale than the lower mass stars ; the time scale depends inversely on the stellar mass .",
    "it is thus not surprising , from a dynamical point of view , that there is no evidence for mass segregation outside the half ",
    "mass radius of 1.7 pc @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , this does not rule out the possibility that the cluster might be mass segregated at birth closer to the cluster center .",
    "evidence for mass segregation has been found in e.g. the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed evidence for mass segregation down to stellar masses of 12 m@xmath2 . due to the youth of the onc , they concluded the mass segregation had to be at least partly primordial .",
    "it is thus possible that r136 is also affected by primordial mass segregation close to the cluster center and that mass segregation is the reason for the difference between the nicmos and wfpc2 imfs .",
    "we can obtain a rough estimate of the cluster mass from the near  infrared observations .",
    "the main limitation in our mass estimate is the amount of confusion due to crowding in the cluster centre : our data mainly samples the imf down to and below 1.4 m@xmath2 outside 3 pc . nevertheless , we can utilise the mass estimates within 2 pc from @xcite to complement our mass estimate down to 2.1 m@xmath2 . inside",
    "2 pc and into 0.15 pc , the results are extrapolated from the local completeness limit mass down to 2.1 m@xmath2 assuming an underlying salpeter imf .",
    "no stars have been detected less massive than 20 m@xmath2 within the central 0.15 pc radius due to crowding .",
    "the mass in the very center has been estimated from the surface density profile down to 2.8 m@xmath2 in @xcite to be @xmath40 m@xmath2pc@xmath41 , resulting in a mass of 3700 m@xmath2 down to a lower mass limit of 2.1 m@xmath2 .",
    "we find the cluster total mass down to 2.1 m@xmath2 to be @xmath42 m@xmath2 .",
    "the directly determined mass down to 2.8 m@xmath2 within 4.7 pc is found to be @xmath43 m@xmath2 , almost the same as found by @xcite . if the imf follows a salpeter slope down to 0.5 m@xmath2 as observed in the galactic field and nearby lower ",
    "mass clusters @xcite , the total mass in the central region would be roughly double the amount given above , and the total cluster mass would be close to @xmath44m@xmath2 .    the velocity dispersion , and hence the dynamical mass , of the whole ngc 2070 region , including r 136 has been determined by @xcite .",
    "the dynamical mass was determined to be 4.5@xmath45m@xmath2 , almost 5 times higher than expected for r 136 alone , but consistent with the photometric mass for the same area @xcite .",
    "if we take into account that the half mass radius of r 136 is 1.7 pc @xcite , compared to 14 pc for the whole ngc 2070 region and assuming the velocity dispersion is the same in the inner parts of the cluster , we would expect a dynamical mass of 4.5@xmath46m@xmath2=5.5@xmath47m@xmath2 which is lower than the mass expected if the imf is consistent with a galactic imf down to 0.5 m@xmath2 .",
    "thus , at face value , the velocity dispersion would be low enough that the cluster can stay bound .",
    "however , a measurement of the velocity dispersion for the inner regions is necessary to directly compare the photometric mass with the dynamical mass .",
    "we can directly derive the surface brightness profile of the region around r136 in the 30 dor cluster since the data does not suffer from saturated stars .",
    "although bright stars will saturate through the one hour exposure , the non - destructive readout mode ensures that only the first reads are used to derive the magnitude of the brightest stars .",
    "the surface brightness profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ lightprof ] .    between @xmath10.2 and 2 pc ,",
    "the light profile is well fit by a power ",
    "law , whereas inside 0.2 pc the light profile appears to be flattening .",
    "we have therefore fitted the light profile with a power  law modified by a core radius , similar to the approach in @xcite . constraining the fit to inside 2 pc",
    ", we find a slope of @xmath48 , slightly more shallow than @xmath49 derived outside 0.1pc by @xcite using planetary camera onboard hst observations .",
    "the core radius is found to be @xmath50pc , which is less than the resolution of the observations and is thus likely and upper limit .",
    "previous hst optical studies determined a small core radius , @xmath51 pc @xcite , consistent with our findings here .",
    "however , since the derived core radius is smaller than the resolution of the observations , it s evidence is weak .",
    "one or two bright stars off center by only a small amount could mimic a cluster core .",
    "how does the low  mass end of the imf in 30 dor compare with that determined for other massive and dense stellar clusters ?",
    "a top  heavy imf in massive dense clusters has been suggested on theoretical grounds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most convincing example of a young cluster with a present - day mass function departing significantly from a salpeter imf above 1 m@xmath2 is the arches cluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite found an average slope of @xmath52 for the central parsec of the arches cluster , flatter than a salpeter slope of -1.35 .",
    "deeper observations found that the present day mass function in arches to be well approximated by a power  law with a slope of @xmath53 down to 1.3 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , recent work taking differential extinction into account suggest the slope of the power  law is only slightly more shallow than a salpeter slope , @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that even if the observed imf is slightly flatter thann a salpeter imf , this can be explaned by mass segregation .",
    "the mass segregation would be accelerated in the cluster due to the strong gravitational field from the galactic center . by adopting realistic parameters for a model cluster and an appropriate distance from the galactic center",
    ", they found that an input salpeter slope imf would be transformed to the observed present day mass function via strong dynamical evolution .",
    "@xcite showed that the imf of the cluster powering the ngc 3603 hii region was well fitted by a power  law but with a slope flatter than salpeter , @xmath55 .",
    "they further showed evidence for mass segregation for the more massive stars , m@xmath56 m@xmath2 .",
    "the data indicated a slight flattening of the low ",
    "mass content ( m@xmath17 3 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "ngc 3603 is younger than the arches cluster and not affected by a strong tidal gravitational field .",
    "thus it is expected to be less influenced by dynamical mass segregation .",
    "the even more massive starburst clusters appear to be the primary sites ( unit cells ) of star formation in starburst galaxies , including interacting / colliding galaxies such as the antennae or the cartwheel . if starburst clusters are the basic building blocks of certain star ",
    "forming galaxies , their stellar content ( imf ) will affect much of the observed chemical and photometric evolution of galaxies , both at the present epoch and perhaps even more so in the high - redshift past @xcite .",
    "several observational claims have been made that the imf in unresolved starburst clusters is top ",
    "heavy @xcite , although observations of the antennae gave a mixed result @xcite .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the high mass  to  light ratios found in some young starburst clusters are artificially high related to their not being in virial equilibrium due to gas expulsion from the clusters @xcite . during the first 50 myr of the cluster , the velocity dispersion and",
    "hence the cluster mass might be overestimated if the cluster is assumed to be virialized .",
    "@xcite suggest that the top  heavy imfs inferred in young unresolved extragalactic star clusters might be spurious due to their non - virialized dynamical state .    with the present dataset it is clear that the imf in the outer parts of r136 continues as a power ",
    "law down to 1 m@xmath2 , similar to what is found in other star clusters and the slope is similar to what is found in the field . whether this is true for the cluster as a whole depends on the cause for the flattening observed closer to the cluster center",
    ". it would be interesting to know the imf if the observations could be extended closer to the characteristic mass where the galactic field star imf flattens ( 0.5 m@xmath2 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a mass that can be reached in massive young clusters ( @xmath57 4 myr ) in the lmc with ao systems .",
    "it has long been suggested r136 might be a proto  globular cluster @xcite .",
    "the question has been whether r136 would remain bound over a hubble time .",
    "one consequence of a top  heavy imf is that the cluster would dissolve soon after gas expulsion and mass loss due to evolution of the high  mass stars .",
    "however , the detection of stars in r136 less massive than 1 m@xmath2 gives the first _",
    "direct _ evidence that low ",
    "mass stars are formed in a starburst cluster .",
    "the fact that the imf in the outer parts of r136 appears to be a salpeter imf down to at least 1 m@xmath2 gives support to the notion the cluster might be a proto  globular cluster , albeit a light one .",
    "early gas expulsion and subsequent mass loss through stellar evolution will disrupt star clusters deficient in low ",
    "mass stars during the first 5 gyr of the clusters life @xcite however , a determination of the velocity dispersion in the inner parts of the cluster is necessary to determine its final fate .",
    "thus , the presence of low  mass stars is a necessary , but not sufficient condition for the possibility of the cluster to evolve into a globular cluster .",
    "the median mass of galactic globular clusters is 8.1@xmath47 m@xmath2 @xcite , comparable to the mass of r136 .",
    "even if r 136 will remain bound it will lose some mass and might end up as a low  mass globular cluster .",
    "we have analyzed hst / nicmos band data covering the central 14pc@xmath014.25pc around r136 in the ngc 2070 cluster in the lmc .",
    "we have reached the following conclusions :    * from the color  magnitude diagram obtained by combining our photometry with previously published hst / wfpc 2 data we constrain the age of the lower  mass stellar content in the cluster to be 24 myr , consistent with previous estimates .",
