    "<S> it is known that the main criterium for the selection of active objects in the first byurakan , otherwise markarian survey , was the presence of uv - excess on low - dispersion spectra registered on photographic plates obtained with the 1-m shmidt type telescope of byurakan in armenia . using the presence of emission lines as the second criterium became possible during the second byurakan survey because of its improved technique . through this criterium a majority of objects , extended by morphology ( i.e. not stellated ) , were selected into the separate `` sample of galaxies '' of sbs . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , there were cases of untrue selection , particularly , on faint magnitudes , when absorption lines were taken for emission ones and so on </S>",

    "<S> the completion of the follow - up slit spectroscopy of these about 500 objects of up to 19.5 apparent magnitude , followed by obtaining of the redshifts and absolute magnitudes , formed the main stage of implementation of the program . </S>",
    "<S> observations were carried out with the 6-m telescope of sao russia and the 2.6-m byurakan telescope . also , the scheme , adapted to spectral material , was developed to provide homogeneous classification , directed , in particular , to separate galaxies of agn activity , dividing them by well - known types , and starforming , sfg , activity . as a first step in classification of starforming galaxies , which constitute more than 80%  of the basic sample , we provided two classes , sfgcontinual and sfgnebular . </S>",
    "<S> averaged statistics of our sfg galaxies show , that every fifth of them is in more active , nebular phase of starforming activity , most of which are known as blue compact galaxies . especially in connection with this it must be noted , that , by the analysis , namely for the latter objects , the effectiveness of the survey is the highest , so that blue compact galaxies represent the best product of sbs among extended objects . aimed on further specifications in classification of sfg galaxies , other generalizations and statistics in frames of ongoing investigation , detailed studies of individual galaxies are currently beeing held . in the base are data of panoramic spectroscopy obtained using multipupil spectrographs mpfs and vagr , on observations with the 6-m telescope of sao russia and the 2.6-m telescope of byurakan , correspondently . </S>"
