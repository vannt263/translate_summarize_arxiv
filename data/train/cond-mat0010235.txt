    "thus , a tree - like structure is generated , which can be viewed as an interesting intermediate between colloids and polymers : dendrimers of low generations exhibit enough degrees of conformational freedom and will thus present fluctuating structures in solution . hence , these structures will greatly resemble star polymers or lightly branched polymers .",
    "if , on the other hand , the number of generations is increased , steric interactions between the groups located at the periphery of the molecule must result . in this case ,",

    "hence , dendrimers of higher generation will resemble dense colloidal structures .",
    "the average radial density distribution @xmath0 of dendrimers is still a matter of debate .",
    "here , the question arises , whether dissolved dendrimers exhibit their maximum segment density in the center or at the periphery of the molecule .",

    "subsequent theoretical studies , however , showed that dendrimers exhibit their maximum segment density at the center of the molecule @xcite . only if electrostatic repulsion operates between the segments of the dendrimer , a dense shell structure is to be expected @xcite .",

    "the effective interaction between dendrimer centers is formally defined as follows @xcite : the centers of mass of the dendrimers are kept fixed at prescribed positions and a canonical trace is carried out over all monomer degrees of freedom .",
    "this procedure yields a constrained free energy , depending on the instantaneous configuration of the dendrimers centers of mass .",
    "then , the effective interaction energy between the dendrimers is @xmath16 times the logarithm of this partition function , where @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath18 is the absolute temperature .",
    "when averaging over the dendrimers positions by employing the so - defined effective hamiltonian , the thermodynamics of the system remains invariant .",
    "in general , this procedure generates two- , three- and higher - order interactions between the centers of mass of the dendrimers .",

    "( [ rhor.2 ] ) and ( [ tofr ] ) we obtain the monomer density as : @xmath38    we now assume that two such dendrimers are kept with their centers of mass at a separation @xmath39 apart and wish to calculate the ensuing interaction potential .",
    "let us assume that the monomer - monomer interaction potential is given by some function @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the positions of the two monomers . in the _ mean - field approximation _",
    ", i.e. , ignoring the correlations and possible deformations of the dendrimers , the total interaction potential @xmath43 can be approximated by a double integral over the unperturbed density profiles times the monomer - monomer interaction kernel @xcite .",
    "this approximation should hold when the dendrimers are not too deeply interpenetrating and reads as : @xmath44 we now make the simplest possible assumption and model the monomer - monomer interaction by a delta function ( contact repulsion ) : @xmath45 introducing the excluded volume parameter @xmath46 .",
    "( [ dconv ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) then yield : @xmath47 in this approximation , the interaction is proportional to the convolution of the monomer density of a single dendrimer with itself . but each density profile has the form @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath32 times a normalized gaussian with width parameter @xmath49 .",
    "it is known that the convolution of a normalized gaussian having width @xmath49 with itself is again a normalized gaussian , but with width @xmath50 .",
    "hence , eqs .",
    "( [ rhor.3 ] ) and ( [ conv ] ) yield the final result : @xmath51 the effective potential depends only on the magnitude @xmath52 of the center - to - center separation , because of rotational symmetry .",
    "note that the interaction potential of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) above , is identical to the flory - krigbaum effective interaction potential between the centers of mass of two polymer chains @xcite .",
    "the fact that we are dealing with dendrimers enters into the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath53 . for long , self - avoiding chains , @xmath54 holds ; in the present study this is not the case and we determine both quantities from experiment .",
    "the important feature is that the resulting interaction has a gaussian form : @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 the task is now to calculate @xmath58 from the experimental data .",
    "the number of monomers per dendrimer , is @xmath59 , ( see fig .",
    "[ dendrimer ] ) where the aromatic end - groups are also included in the counting as `` single monomers '' .",
    "next we need an estimate for the excluded volume parameter @xmath46 . for this , we set @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the monomer length . taking the realistic value @xmath62 for the latter quantity ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath63 the above values , together with the experimentally determined gyration radius @xmath64 nm yield : @xmath65 the corresponding value for _ linear chains _ is about @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "hence , the energy barrier for the dendrimers at hand is about five times higher as that for linear chains , a result that is physically reasonable as dendrimers are more compact objects than chains .",
    "a general study of the structural and thermodynamic properties of a system of particles interacting by a gaussian potential ( the `` gaussian core model '' , gcm ) , has been presented recently @xcite .",
    "the gcm shows _ no freezing _ for @xmath67 @xcite , hence we conclude that the system of dendrimers at hand will remain fluid at all concentrations .",
    "next , we express the density of dendrimers in units that are more convenient . since there are @xmath9 dendrimers in the volume @xmath10 , the density @xmath68 of dendrimers is @xmath69 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the volume fraction @xmath70 was used which is related to @xmath68 by @xmath71 in order to suppress the dependence on @xmath31 , it is natural to use as the unit of length the parameter @xmath72 of the pair potential and to introduce a dimensionless measure of the density , namely : @xmath73 which may be regarded as an effective volume fraction of the dissolved dendrimers . from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ eta ] ) we obtain : @xmath74 where the known values @xmath75 and @xmath76 have been used @xcite .",
    "for every value of @xmath77 , the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) equation @xcite for a system interacting via @xmath78 was solved and the structure factor @xmath15 was obtained as a function of @xmath79 . using eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) we obtain @xmath80 .",
    "this is in close agreement with the effective radius of 2.4 nm estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite by a simple model valid only for dilute solutions . in what is to follow the @xmath2-scale was reexpressed in @xmath81 units .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fits.gauss ] , the gaussian interaction potential yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment at all three concentrations measured .",
    "moreover , this is achieved without the use of free fit parameters and it is physically reasonable that soft , interpenetrable objects such as dendrimers interact by means of a correspondingly soft interaction .",
    "the boundedness of the effective interaction at zero separations between the dendrimer centers is also physically correct : configurations where the centers of mass of two dendrimers coincide are possible , without violation of excluded - volume conditions , hence the effective potential does not diverge at the origin .",
    "this is quite analogous to the case of polymer chains , where the effective interaction is _ known _ to be gaussian @xcite .    the precise numerical value @xmath82 of the energy barrier , eq .",
    "( [ numerical ] ) , yields an optimal agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , small deviations from this value can also be tolerated and by comparing with the sans data we have established the limits in which this parameter can vary as @xmath83 , yielding a corresponding tolerance interval @xmath84 for the `` effective monomer length '' @xmath61 .",
    "a prominent characteristic of the gaussian potential at the reduced temperatures considered here ( and also at higher ones ) , is its property to yield structure factors which do not show any pronounced peak with increasing density , in direct contradistinction with hard , diverging interactions such as the hard sphere ( hs ) potential @xcite . in order to demonstrate this point ,",
    "we have also attempted to fit the experimental data using a hypothetical hs interaction between the dendrimers , with the hs diameter @xmath85 as a fit parameter .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fits.hs ] .",
    "the best fit at the lowest concentration is obtained by the choice @xmath86 , which is thereafter kept constant .",
    "it can be seen that the fit quality worsens with increasing density , as the hs interaction yields a too high peak as well as a structure factor at low @xmath2-values which lies below the experimental data . however , as we are in the very dilute regime , the strong differences between the structure factors produced by these two interactions ( gaussian and hs ) are not very pronounced .",
    "these differences become evident only if one looks at higher densities .",
    "the result found here is therefore in agreement with the findings of ref .  @xcite .",
    "there it has been found that modeling the structure factor in terms of a simple hard - sphere ansatz leads to a satisfactory description of the data in the region of lowest volume fractions .",
    "it is therefore evident that a more stringent test of theory can only be achieved by sans - studies conducted at much higher concentrations .",
    "experiments using the g4 and g5 dendrimer used in ref .",
    "@xcite are under way . here",
    "we present further evidence for the validity of the proposed interaction by comparing with and by offering a theoretical explanation for data already existing in the literature @xcite .    in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite , ramzi _ et al . _",
    "display the experimentally determined structure factor for a very wide concentration range of dendrimers , ranging from dilute to above the overlap concentration .",
    "it is seen that @xmath15 is deprived of any significant structure ; it has a weak peak of height @xmath87 at intermediate concentrations and thereafter the peak disappears and @xmath15 becomes a monotonic function of @xmath2 . at the same time , this phenomenon is accompanied by a monotonic reduction of the osmotic compressibility of the solution , the latter being proportional to the @xmath88 limit of @xmath15 .",
    "this is _ precisely _ the behavior of @xmath15 of the gaussian core model @xcite .",
    "the latter has a freezing and reentrant melting transition with increasing density at energies @xmath89 , meaning that the liquid @xmath15 has an anomalous dependence on the density : the height of its principal maximum grows up to a certain density and then it diminishes again . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the anomaly in @xmath15 remains , but the height of the principal peak becomes smaller . in order to provide a semi - quantitative comparison with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite , we show in fig .",
    "[ gauss.anom ] the evolution of @xmath15 of the gcm with density for an energy barrier @xmath90 and packing fractions @xmath91 , corresponding to @xmath92 .",

    "7 and 8 in ref .  @xcite . there ,",
    "the @xmath15 s from samples of two different dendrimers are displayed ; the same anomalous dependence of @xmath15 on the concentration is seen , with the additional feature that the @xmath15 s from the dendrimers with the larger generation number have higher peaks than their counterparts from the smaller dendrimers at the same concentration . in our language",
    ", a larger generation number , which implies a larger monomer number @xmath32 , corresponds to a higher energy barrier @xmath58 , see eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) .",
    "this automatically causes @xmath15 to develop stronger peaks for larger generation numbers .    of particular interest",
    "is the shape of @xmath15 for very high concentrations which , as can be seen in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite is a monotonic function of @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior can be fully understood in the framework of the gaussian interaction potential .",
    "it has been recently shown that bounded potentials in general , show at high densities a particular ` mean - field behavior ' @xcite .",
    "the direct correlation function @xmath93 in this limit becomes equal to @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the interaction potential at hand and @xmath96 .",

    "( [ sofq.analytic ] ) shows that , for the gcm , @xmath15 has the form of a `` smoothed out '' step function .",
    "it is small at low @xmath2 s and approaches unity at high @xmath2 s , as @xmath100 there .",
    "the same conclusion holds , actually , for any bounded potential whose fourier transform is a monotonically decaying , nonnegative function of @xmath2 @xcite , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ sofq.general ] )",
    ".    the anomalous behavior of the peak heights of the structure factor would be impossible if the assumed interaction between dendrimers were diverging at the origin as any power law .",
    "indeed , power - law systems are known to undergo a freezing transition , this implying that the corresponding @xmath15 develops stronger and stronger peaks with increasing density until , ultimately , freezing occurs when the principal peak reaches the quasi - universal hansen - verlet value @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "hence , effective dendrimer - dendrimer interactions with such kinds of divergence at the origin can be immediately ruled out .",
    "this argument , however , does not rule out _ all _ diverging interactions .",
    "indeed , the peak - height anomaly has also been observed in the framework of a theoretical treatment of star polymers @xcite , whose effective interaction is diverging logarithmically at the origin .",
    "this behavior , which has also been experimentally seen @xcite , is again intimately related to the reentrant melting behavior of these systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has already been suggested @xcite that dendrimers may resemble star polymers below the critical arm number @xmath102 at which crystallization is marginally possible @xcite . however , at variance with the gaussian interaction , the star - star effective potential @xcite does _ not _ have a mean - field high density limit and the structure factor of stars never becomes a monotonic function of @xmath2 , even at extremely high densities @xcite , a feature which appears for bounded interactions only . in this respect , there is a difference between the effective interaction between the central monomers of two dendrites or two stars ( which diverges ) and that between their centers of mass ( which does not ) .    on purely theoretical grounds , the underlying assumptions leading to the derivation of the logarithmic interaction between star polymers",
    "do not hold for dendrimers .",
    "unlike stars , dendrimers do not obey a power - law dependence of the density profile around the center ; they show no self - similarity , captured in the daoud - cotton blob model of the stars @xcite ; and they are at least one order of magnitude smaller than star polymers , with the implication that many of the notions of polymer physics , based on long chains and universality can not be automatically carried over to dendrimers .",
    "we conclude this section with a remark on the accuracy of the pair potential approximation .",
    "though many - body forces between the dendrimers are necessarily present in the solution , there are good reasons to believe that their effect can be neglected to a very good approximation .",
    "this belief is based on the one hand on the corresponding findings on star polymers @xcite . by a direct measurement of the triplet forces",
    ", it was established there that these have a very small effect on the total force on a star center , and this only shows up at concentrations considerably beyond the overlap value . on the other hand , a recent simulational work by louis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , reached a similar conclusion for single chains .",
    "there , it was found that the pair potential yielding the correct thermodynamics of the system remains density - independent up to the overlap concentration and displays only a very weak density dependence above the latter .",
    "this density dependence is , of course , just another way to formulate the many - body effects .",
    "once more , they were found to be of minor significance . barring any dramatic alterations in the conformations of single dendrimers upon increasing density ( such as collapsing )",
    ", we expect the gaussian pair potential picture to capture the salient characteristics of the behavior of this system at all concentrations .",
    "by using the density profile of an isolated dendrimer and the experimentally determined characteristics of the macromolecules as input , we derived an effective interaction between the dendrimers centers of mass which is gaussian in form . by direct comparison with experimental data at dilute solutions ,",
    "we show that this interaction provides an excellent description of the measured structure factor .",
    "moreover , it reproduces correctly the as of now unexplained trends and features of experimental structure factors at higher densities .",
    "a direct comparison with sans data at high concentrations is , evidently , of crucial importance for further putting the proposed theory into a strong test .",
