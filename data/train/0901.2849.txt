    "hydrodynamics is one of the main tools for studying the collective flow in high - energy nuclear collisions . in this approach",
    ", it is assumed that , after a complex process involving microscopic collisions of nuclear constituents , at a certain early instant a hot and dense matter is formed , which would be in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "after this instant , the system would expand hydrodynamically , following the well known set of differential equations .",
    "the initial conditions ( ic ) for the hydrodynamic expansion are usually parametrized as smooth distributions of thermodynamic quantities and four - velocity .",
    "however , since our systems are small , important _ event - by - event fluctuations _ are expected in the ic of the real collisions . moreover",
    ", each set of ic should presents strongly _",
    "inhomogeneous structure_. our purpose here is to discuss some of the effects caused by such fluctuating and bumpy ic on observables .",
    "the main tool for our study is called nexspherio .",
    "it is a junction of two computational codes : nexus and spherio .",
    "the nexus code @xcite is used to compute the ic .",
    "it is a microscopic model based on the regge - gribov theory and , once a pair of incident nuclei and their incident energy are chosen , it can produce , in the event - by - event basis , detailed space distributions of energy - momentum tensor , baryon - number , strangeness and charge densities , at a given initial time @xmath2fm .",
    "we show in fig.[ic ] an example of such a fluctuating event , produced by nexus event generator , for central au  +  au collision at @xmath3gev . as seen , the energy - density distribution is highly irregular and in a transverse plane ( left panel ) it presents several high - density blobs , whereas in a longitudinal plane ( right panel ) it presents a baton - like structure . when averaged over many events , these bumps disappear completely giving smooth ic , as those commonly used in hydro calculations .",
    "however , this bumpy structure gives important effects as we will show below .",
    "the spherio code @xcite , based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm @xcite , is well suited to computing the evolution of such systems , so complex as the one shown in fig.[ic ] .    a gev .",

    "in a previous paper @xcite , we discussed some effects of the bumpy structure of ic , as shown in fig.[ic ] , on @xmath0 spectra and @xmath1 coefficient .",
    "the main consequence of baton structure is a violent and cylindrically isotropic expansion of the batons , which produces additional isotropic high-@xmath0 particles .",
    "as clearly shown in fig  [ dndpt ] , this implies that high-@xmath0 part of the @xmath0 spectrum becomes enhanced as compared with the smooth averaged ic case , making it more concave and closer to data .",

    "data points @xcite are also plotted for comparison . ]      as for the anisotropy of the transverse flow , we illustrate in fig.[v2pt ] that the elliptic - flow coefficient @xmath1 suffers reduction as we go to high-@xmath0 region , due to the additional high-@xmath0 isotropic component included now .",

    ", width=245 ]      as for the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath8 , we know that the average matter density decreases as @xmath9 increases as reflected in the @xmath7 distribution of charged particles , so the isotropic expansion effect of the batons becomes more efficacious there and , therefore , @xmath8 suffers a considerable reduction in those regions .",

    "in this paper , we presented several consequences of event - by - event fluctuating ic with baton structure , computed with nexspherio code .",
    "the main results are : 1 ) the baton structure of ic produces more concave @xmath0 spectra , as compared with smooth ic ; 2 ) it reduces @xmath6 both in the high-@xmath0 and large-@xmath16 regions ; 3 ) it also produces the _ ridge structure _ in the nearside correlations ; 4 ) large @xmath1 fluctuations occurs , in good agreement with data .",
