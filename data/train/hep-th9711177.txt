    "brane creation is a key to understanding string dualities and also field theory dualities . after the first analysis@xcite",
    ", many discussions and results@xcite are given for brane creations .",
    "in this paper , we show a proof of brane creation@xcite and give a new result relating to dirichlet sixbrane .",
    "an importance is stressed of the role of the dirac string from dirichlet sixbrane .    in section  [ bc ]",
    "we refine our proof in ref .",
    "we consider , in @xmath0-theory , the simplest case of an ns fivebrane and a dirichlet sixbrane , since it is enough to understand the dirichlet fourbrane creation when the two branes cross .",
    "we figure out shapes of the ns fivebrane changing the distance to the dirichlet sixbrane .",
    "we find a crossover from a smooth to a distorted ns fivebrane .",
    "then , we take the type iia limit of the @xmath0-theory brane configurations , and we show that a dirichlet fourbrane is created under a suitable situation . in section  [ fds ] we consider an @xmath0-brane configuration for four dimensional @xmath1 supersymmetric qcd . we investigate how the simplest analysis , given in section  [ bc ] , works in this brane configuration .",
    "we find a difficulty that for a specific crossing of branes an unknown fourbrane is created . to save the difficulty the dirac string extending from the dirichlet sixbrane plays an important role .",
    "in order to see that the dirac string is not a unphysical object at all , we show that the dirichlet sixbrane contributes to the @xmath2-function of the low energy field theory through the dirac string .",
    "we consider an @xmath0-theory brane configuration according to ref .",
    "we are assuming that the circumference of the @xmath3 dimensional space is @xmath4 .",
    "we put @xmath5 for simplicity , otherwise stated .",
    "we start by considering a single fivebrane and a single sixbrane .",
    "sixbrane is meant by a removable nut singularity of a taub - nut space @xmath6 in @xmath0-theory.@xcite then , putting the sixbrane in the point @xmath7 defines the taub - nut space @xmath6 .",
    "the worldvolume of the fivebrane is topologically @xmath8 .",
    "the four dimensional part @xmath9 is parametrized by the coordinate @xmath10 .",
    "the complex plane @xmath11 is embedded holomorphically into the taub - nut space , by which the @xmath1 supersymmetry is left in four dimensions .",
    "we introduce complex coordinates @xmath12 one choice of holomorphic coordinates@xcite of the taub - nut space are @xmath13 and @xmath14 if the @xmath15 gauge symmetry is fixed in such a way that the dirac string extends from the sixbrane to the positive @xmath16 direction , we have the above holomorphic coordinate ( [ y ] ) . here , dirac string severely restricts the way to take a holomorphic coordinate , and vice versa .",
    "if we define a part of the holomorphic coordinates by setting @xmath17 , then there are only two ways to put the dirac string in @xmath18 space ; one way is to put it so that it extends from sixbrane to the positive infinity of the @xmath16 direction , and the other way is to the negative infinity .",
    "now , we come to the point . according to witten s argument@xcite ,",
    "there are two distinct ways of embedding in the present setup , depending on whether the sixbrane is to the left or the right of the fivebrane",
    ". we will consider the case when the sixbrane is to the left of the fivebrane .",
    "thus , we pick up the holomorphic coordinate @xmath19 defined by eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) and embed the complex plane @xmath11 by @xmath20    the angular part of eq .",
    "( [ m5 ] ) states that @xmath21 jumps by @xmath22 when one circles around the origin in the complex @xmath13 plane .",
    "this requires an interpretation : the taub - nut space @xmath6 is a circle bundle on the three dimensional base space @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the position of the nut singularity .",
    "we have a projection @xmath25 to the base space ; @xmath26 . the projection @xmath25 is defined by forgetting the dependence of the variable @xmath21 .",
    "suppose we project , by @xmath25 , the curve embedded in this fibre bundle into the base space .",
    "the radial part of the embedding equation represents the projected curve , and the projected curve is again two dimensional . define a closed one - cycle on the projected curve on the base space .",
    "the value of @xmath21 can jump by @xmath27 when we go along the one - cycle , which is meant by the fivebrane is `` wrapping '' around @xmath28 .",
    "we should note that in a usual type iia language such `` wrapping '' means by a non - trivial @xmath15 gauge potential on the ns fivebrane worldvolume .",
    "let us see that the jump @xmath29 implies a vortex on the fivebrane worldvolume .",
    "we have a @xmath15 gauge potential @xmath30 and a scalar @xmath21 on the two dimensional part @xmath11 of the fivebrane worldvolume .",
    "these two fields are related by the @xmath15 gauge symmetry ; @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ". this symmetry defines the minimal coupling between @xmath30 and @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , we have anomalous coupling @xmath33 with an identification @xmath34 .",
    "now , the ns fivebrane is penetrated by the dirac string of the sixbrane in the present coordinate system .",
    "then , picking up a small two dimensional disc @xmath35 from the two dimensional part @xmath11 of the fivebrane around the origin @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath37 which induces a vortex on the ns fivebrane worldvolume .    the radial part of eq .",
    "( [ m5 ] ) determines the form of the complex plane @xmath11 in the base space of the taub - nut space as latexmath:[\\[\\label{vb }    @xmath15 symmetry rotating @xmath13 , we may regard the variable @xmath13 as non - negative real number ( @xmath39 ) without loss of generality .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath40 , which we call @xmath41 , is given at the intersection point of the fivebrane and the dirac string extending from the sixbrane to the right - infinity .",
    "then , the value of @xmath41 is determined by @xmath42 which is the zeros of eq .",
    "( [ vb ] ) . with the relation ( [ b01 ] ) at hand , instead of considering the quantity @xmath41 as a function of @xmath43 , it is often convenient to regard @xmath43 as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "as explained in the following , the relation allows us to capture briefly a first observation that when the sixbrane crosses the fivebrane a `` new '' fivebrane is created .",
    "a complete proof will appear in subsection  [ iia ] . if @xmath44 , the first term in eq .  ( [ b01 ] ) dominates , and we have @xmath45 , which shows that the top of the fivebrane responds linearly to the position of the sixbrane . if @xmath46 , the second term in eq .  ( [ b01 ] ) dominates , and we have @xmath47 , which means that @xmath41 does not depend on @xmath43 so much .",
    "the intermediate region @xmath48 is a crossover between these two behaviors .",
    "now , let us draw the geometrical shape of the embedded fivebrane from eq .",
    "( [ vb ] ) in more detail .",
    "as learned in the above briefly , clear situations appear when the sixbrane is far from the origin .",
    "first , let us consider the case @xmath44 .",
    "the functional form of @xmath13 asymptotically becomes @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "this shows that @xmath40 approaches to @xmath43 if @xmath13 goes to zero .",
    "next , let us consider the case @xmath46 .",
    "asymptotically we have @xmath51 for @xmath52 . the fact that @xmath53 implies the numerical factor in front of eq .",
    "( [ b1<b ] ) is large , and then a small variation of @xmath40 around @xmath41 leads to a large variation of @xmath13 . in other words ,",
    "the quantity @xmath40 is almost independent for the value of @xmath13 .",
    "namely , we have asymptotically @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "notice that the asymptotic form ( [ b1<b ] ) with @xmath56 is also valid for the former case @xmath44 .    as a result ,",
    "the following situations are realized geometrically : when @xmath57 , a part of the fivebrane gets involved in the distant sixbrane , and is wrapping around the @xmath3 dimension .",
    "this involved part of the fivebrane may be interpreted as a semi - infinite dirichlet fourbrane of long thin tube extending to the right . on the other hand , when @xmath58 , the fivebrane becomes a neveu - schwartz fivebrane parallel to the @xmath13 plane . in these two limits ,",
    "the taub - nut space becomes a flat space @xmath59 around the origin .",
    "this result will give a geometrical explanation of a brane creation via @xmath0-theory .",
    "however , we have no clear distinction of the boundary between ns fivebrane and d fourbrane .",
    "the best way to figure out such distinction is to take the type iia limit in the @xmath0-theory , which will be done in the next .      in this section",
    "we recover the parameter @xmath60 and we put @xmath61 and redefine @xmath17 for simplicity .",
    "the iia limit is defined as @xmath62 for a fixed position of the sixbrane @xmath63 . as",
    "the parameter @xmath60 approaches to zero , the shape of the fivebrane changes , and we have essentially two final shapes depending on the value of the sixbrane position @xmath64 .",
    "the following analysis will draw the final two shapes .",
    "first of all , let us consider how the bended tail , i.e. around @xmath65 , of the fivebrane becomes .",
    "in this region we have @xmath66 , and from eq .",
    "( [ vb ] ) we obtain asymptotically @xmath67 . taking inverse in this asymptotic relation and taking the iia limit",
    ", we find @xmath68 for any large value of @xmath69 .",
    "this means that the tail of the fivebrane is fixed to be @xmath68 .",
    "second , we consider the relation ( [ b01 ] ) .",
    "the crossover point @xmath70 is evaluated from @xmath71 , and we have @xmath72 or numerically @xmath73 .",
    "the important point is that this value is a finite constant .",
    "then , in the iia limit , we have the crossover point @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , a slight consideration about eq .",
    "( [ b01 ] ) allows us to obtain @xmath75 in the iia limit .",
    "this relation clearly shows that if @xmath76 the position @xmath77 of the fivebrane stays and if @xmath78 the position @xmath77 moves with @xmath64 .    finally , we figure out from eq .",
    "( [ vb ] ) how the shape of the fivebrane becomes geometrically in the iia limit .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath64 there are three ways to take the iia limit ; such as @xmath57 , @xmath79 and @xmath58 for @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively . then , to take the iia limit of the functional form ( [ vb ] ) , we divide the region of @xmath64 into the three pieces ; ( a ) @xmath80 , ( b ) @xmath81 and ( c ) @xmath82 .         in this case",
    "we send @xmath57 in the iia limit , and as well as we have @xmath83 asymptotically .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath84 .",
    "we easily find that brane in the region @xmath85 shrinks to the point @xmath86 in the iia limit .",
    "it is enough to consider the region @xmath87 for the present case .",
    "let us find the functional form between @xmath88 and @xmath13 in the iia limit in a region wise manner , dividing the region of @xmath88 into three ; @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath89 , we have @xmath92 from eq .",
    "( [ vb ] ) in the iia limit . if @xmath90 , we also have @xmath92 from eq .",
    "( [ vb ] ) , or eq .  ( [ b < b0 ] ) , in the iia limit .",
    "therefore , as approaching @xmath93 , the fivebrane in @xmath94 becomes a thin tube , and finally a straight line in the iia limit reducing its dimension by one .",
    "if @xmath95 , the functional form ( [ vb ] ) approaches to @xmath96 taking the inverse of this form , we find @xmath97 for @xmath98 in the iia limit .",
    "the resultant brane configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ iia branes ] ( a ) .",
    "how about the variable @xmath21 ?",
    "the angular part of eq .",
    "( [ m5 ] ) states in the iia limit that there is a vortex on the resultant ns fivebrane at the origin of the @xmath13 plane .",
    "it may be interpreted that this vortex is made by the fourbrane ending on the ns fivebrane . moreover , as explained before , the jump of @xmath21 by @xmath27 means that the thin tube , or the straight line @xmath99 $ ] , in @xmath23 is found wrapping around the @xmath3 dimension in q. now , we prove that a dirichlet fourbrane is created when a sixbrane crosses a ns fivebrane .",
    "in this case we have @xmath100 .",
    "so , we are enough to consider in the region @xmath91 . for",
    "the parameter @xmath60 goes to zero , the functional form ( [ vb ] ) asymptotically approaches to @xmath101 .",
    "taking the inverse to this form , and the iia limit , then we find @xmath68 for @xmath55 . the resultant brane configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ iia branes ] ( b ) .      in this case",
    "we send @xmath58 in the iia limit . from eq .",
    "( [ b01 ] ) we have @xmath102 . the functional form ( [ vb ] ) asymptotically approaches to @xmath103 after @xmath88 is expressed in terms of @xmath13 , we find , in the iia limit , @xmath104 for @xmath55 .",
    "the resultant brane configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ iia branes ] ( c ) . in this case , as well as the case ( b ) , the ns fivebrane has a vortex at the origin of the @xmath13 plane , however , there is no d fourbrane .",
    "then , it is impossible to understand that the vortex is stemmed from any d fourbrane .",
    "instead , we should actually interpret this vortex as a consequence of the fact that the fivebrane is penetrated by the dirac string coming from the sixbrane .",
    "this point will be explained in the next section .",
    "in this section we consider the brane configuration for four dimensional finite @xmath1 @xmath105 supersymmetric qcd .",
    "the general setup of witten@xcite is used here .",
    "we will observe a peculiar property stemming from dirac string of the multi - taub - nut space .",
    "we put @xmath106 dirichlet fourbranes on @xmath107 @xmath108 and @xmath109 dirichlet sixbranes on @xmath110 @xmath111 , where we do not consider the center of mass ; @xmath112 .",
    "let us consider a generic brane configuration in which any fourbranes and sixbranes do not collide , which means @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) and @xmath115 . setting a value of",
    "the sqcd coupling constant defines the following parameter @xmath116 , and the riemann surface for the @xmath0-fivebrane is @xmath117 where @xmath118 the sixbranes define the multi - taub - nut space with the metric @xmath119 the one - form @xmath120 satisfies the bogomolny equation for the dirac monopoles ; @xmath121 .",
    "the multi - taub - nut space is parameterized by two coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath19 . as mentioned in section  [ bc ] ,",
    "choosing one holomorphic coordinate @xmath13 , say @xmath17 as above , severely restricts the direction of the dirac strings coming from the sixbranes . with this choice of @xmath13",
    "only the positive or negative direction of the coordinate @xmath122 is allowed for the dirac strings .",
    "if the dirac string extends to the `` right '' , the one - form is @xmath123 and the other holomorphic coordinate is @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "if the dirac string extends to the `` left '' , the one - form is given by eq .",
    "( [ w+ ] ) with @xmath126 changed the sign , here we call it @xmath127 , and the other holomorphic coordinate is @xmath128      since we would like to know the behavior of branes when a sixbrane approaches to the fivebrane along the @xmath40 direction , it is enough to concentrate on the single sixbrane , say @xmath129 .",
    "we obtain two branches @xmath130 from the curve ( [ swc ] ) . in the leading order of @xmath131",
    "we find @xmath132 and @xmath133 for some non - zero constants @xmath134 and @xmath2 . picking up one , @xmath135 , of the two possible holomorphic coordinate systems ,",
    "the two ns fivebranes are embedded by @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "first of all , let us consider the case when the dirac string extends to the right ; i.e. @xmath138 .",
    "in the leading order of @xmath131 the holomorphic coordinate becomes @xmath139 for some non - zero constant @xmath140 .",
    "which branches @xmath141 is the right ns fivebrane corresponding to ?",
    "a little effort reveals that the branch @xmath142 is embedded to the right of the branch @xmath143 in this case .",
    "then , the branch @xmath142 is corresponding to the right ns fivebrane .",
    "the analysis of the embedding @xmath137 is exactly the same as that given in section  [ bc ] . as for the embedding @xmath136 ,",
    "the analysis is carried out almost the same way as for the case @xmath137 .",
    "taking the radial part of @xmath136 projects the curve into the base space @xmath23 .",
    "the radial part of @xmath136 , rewritten as @xmath144 states the same result of the case @xmath137 : when the sixbrane approaches to the branch @xmath143 , the fivebrane is fairly distorted .",
    "when the sixbrane goes away from the branch @xmath143 , the fivebrane remains its shape .",
    "next , let us consider the angular part of @xmath136 .",
    "the angular part states that the @xmath21 does not jump when one circles around the position @xmath145 , or rather the @xmath21 is a constant .",
    "namely , the @xmath0-fivebrane is not wrapping around the @xmath3 dimension .",
    "this is always true no matter how the sixbrane approaches to or goes away from the branch @xmath143 .",
    "this situation means the following .",
    "even when a fourbrane is created in the iia limit , this fourbrane can not be identified with a dirichlet fourbrane , because it does not create vortex at the endpoint on the ns fivebrane .",
    "to save the situation try embedding the curve ( [ swc ] ) in a slightly different way .",
    "flip the direction of the dirac string , and carry out the analysis from the beginning .",
    "we should notice that changing thing is only the direction of the dirac string and others such as all the fourbranes and sixbranes stay in their positions .",
    "the positions of the two branches @xmath141 are exchanged , however the radial parts of the _ left and right _ fivebrane embedding formulae do not change . now , the left part of the @xmath0-fivebrane changes from the branch @xmath143 to the branch @xmath142 , and the @xmath21 can jump by @xmath27 when one circles around @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , in turn , the created @xmath0 fivebrane begins wrapping around the @xmath3 dimension .",
    "then , in the iia limit the endpoint of the created fourbrane on the ns fivebrane behaves as a vortex , and then the fourbrane may be identified with a dirichlet fourbrane .",
    "one important fact is that the branch @xmath146 is always penetrated by the dirac string and the @xmath21 of this branch , not of the branch @xmath143 , can jump by @xmath27 .",
    "we learn that the branch @xmath142 ( or @xmath143 ) is not always to the right ( or left ) of the @xmath147 sixbrane , depending on the direction of the dirac string .",
    "when the direction of the dirac string changes , the positions of the two branches are also exchanged .",
    "unchanging things are the projected curve on the base space of the taub - nut space .",
    "let us place the @xmath147 sixbrane in between the two ns fivebranes with appropriate distances to the two fivebranes .",
    "even in this `` normal '' configuration , the dirac string makes a vortex on the penetrated ns fivebrane .",
    "one might try to avoid the dirac string by separately considering about each ns fivebrane , flipping the dirac string appropriately . however , this is impossible .",
    "we indeed need the dirac string , since the sixbrane contributes to the one - loop @xmath2-function of the low energy field theory through its dirac string .",
    "we will explain this fact in the following .",
    "first , let us briefly recall the basic ingredients needed to explain . in general , the difference of the variables @xmath148 on the two side of the @xmath0-fivebrane gives the one - loop gauge coupling constant @xmath149 , or more precisely @xmath150 at large distance @xmath151.@xcite here , @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the positions of the left and the right fivebranes in @xmath148 plane , respectively .",
    "when one circles around the endpoint of a dirichlet fourbrane , @xmath152 or @xmath153 can jump by @xmath27 , which counts a contribution to the @xmath2-function .",
    "an important fact is that this contribution persists owing to the holomorphy for any scale of @xmath13 .",
    "we should notice that that the contributions are considered of the bi - fundamental or fundamental matters from dirichlet fourbranes or semi - infinite dirichlet fourbranes , but the argument is missing for matters from dirichlet sixbranes .",
    "now , we come back to the explanation .",
    "no matter which direction is chosen for the dirac string , one of the ns fivebranes is penetrated by the dirac string , and on this side it makes a vortex at @xmath145 . on the other side we have no vortex . owing to the dirac string , the vortex of the penetrated ns fivebrane contributes to the @xmath2-function coefficient @xmath154 by one ; @xmath155 , and the other ns fivebrane does not contribute .",
    "this is easily checked from their angular part of the embedding formulae @xmath156 . as a result",
    ", we have the correct one - loop @xmath2-function coefficient , for example , @xmath157 for @xmath105 sqcd with @xmath158 flavors , when the fundamental matters are supplied by the sixbranes .",
    "this result can be generalized to more complicated cases , where we have many ns fivebranes .",
    "let us consider one of the many gauge couplings and calculate the difference @xmath159 between the @xmath160 and the @xmath161 ns fivebranes .",
    "the contribution from the sixbranes in between these two ns fivebranes are exactly the same as that in the above @xmath105 sqcd case .",
    "suppose that both of these two fivebranes are not penetrated by a dirac string .",
    "we have no contribution to the @xmath2-function .",
    "suppose that both of these two fivebranes are penetrated by a dirac string .",
    "each vortex of the two fivebranes contributes to the variable @xmath148 , however they cancel in the @xmath2-function .",
