    "the use of truncated moments of the local optical depth has a number of advantages .",

    "we used the wavelength region from 4742 (ly@xmath84 at the redshift of the qso ) to 5618 (ly@xmath19 at the redshift of the qso ) to avoid confusion due to an overlap of intervening ly@xmath19 and ly@xmath84 absorption .",
    "this corresponds to a redshift range from @xmath85 to @xmath81 and is equivalent to @xmath86 ( comoving ) in an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the two spectra were continuum - fitted independently by the observational groups .",
    "the differences in our results should thus give an idea of the error due to continuum - fitting .",
    "two sources of errors are important for our analysis : first the intrinsic error caused by the inversion procedure ; second the cosmic variance error resulting from the use of only one quasar spectrum with limited redshift range .",
