    "as one of the best studied problems in statistical physics , percolation  @xcite is nowadays also the subject of intense research in the field of complex networks  @xcite . in a network , if a fraction of its vertices ( nodes , sites ) or edges ( links , bonds ) is chosen independently with a probability @xmath0 to be  occupied \" , it may undergo a percolation phase transition : when @xmath0 is above a threshold value @xmath1 , called percolation threshold , the network possesses a giant component consisting of a finite fraction of interconnected nodes ; otherwise , the giant component disappears and all nodes disintegrate into small clusters .",
    "so far , percolation in complex networks has received considerable attention in the community of statistical physics  @xcite , because it is not only of high theoretical interest , but also relevant to many aspects of networks , including network security  @xcite , disease spread on networks  @xcite , etc .    since global physical properties of random media",
    "alter substantially at the percolation threshold , which is central to understanding and applying this process , thus the precise knowledge of percolation threshold is extremely important  @xcite .",
    "the issue of determining or calculating the percolation threshold has been the subject of intense study since the introduction of the model over half a century ago  @xcite . despite decades of effort ,",
    "there is still no general method for computing the percolation threshold of arbitrary graphs , and rigorous solution for percolation threshold is confined to some special cases  @xcite , such as the barabsi - albert ( ba ) network  @xcite , two dimensional lattice , and some other lattices . in most cases ( e.g. lattices in three dimensions or above ) ,",
    "the percolation threshold is estimated with numerical simulations , which are often time - consuming  @xcite .",
    "thus , finding the threshold exactly is essential to investigating the percolation problem on a particular graph  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the main reason for studying percolation in complex networks is to understand how the percolation properties are influenced by underlying topological structure .",
    "it has been established that degree distribution has a qualitative impact on the percolation .",
    "recent studies indicated that in uncorrelated scale - free networks the percolation threshold is absent  @xcite .",
    "then a lot of other jobs followed , studying the influences of other properties on the percolation properties in scale - free networks ; these include degree correlations  @xcite , clustering coefficient  @xcite , and so forth .",
    "it was found that , degree correlations and clustering coefficient can strongly affect some percolation properties , but they can not restore a finite percolation threshold in scale - free networks .",
    "this raises the question as to whether scale - free degree distribution is the only ingredient responsible for the absence of the percolation threshold . in other words ,",
    "whether power - law degree distribution suffices to characterize the zero percolation threshold in scale - free networks .    in this paper , we study the effects of power - law degree distribution on the percolation threshold in scale - free networks . to this end",
    ", we first construct a class of scale - free networks with identical degree sequence by introducing a control parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we then study analytically or numerically the topological features of the networks and show that this class of networks has unique topologies . finally ,",
    "using the renormalization - group theory , we investigate analytically the bond percolation problem in the considered networks , and find the existence of non - zero percolation thresholds depending on parameter @xmath2 .",
    "our findings indicate that the degree distribution by itself is not enough to characterize the percolation thresholds in scale - free networks . on the other hand , since our networks have the same degree sequence and thus the same degree distribution , the model proposed here can serve as a useful tool ( substrate model ) to check the impact of power - law degree distribution on the dynamical processes taking place on top of scale - free networks .",
    "in this section , we study the construction and structural properties of the networks under consideration , with focus on degree distribution , clustering coefficient , and average path length ( apl ) .          the proposed networks ( graphs ) are constructed in an iterative way as shown in fig .",
    "let @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) denote the networks after @xmath5 iterations .",
    "then the networks are built in the following way : for @xmath6 , the initial network @xmath7 is two nodes connected by an edge . for @xmath8 , @xmath3",
    "is obtained from @xmath9 .",
    "we replace each existing link in @xmath9 either by a connected cluster of links on the top right of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with probability @xmath2 , or by the connected cluster on the bottom right with complementary probability @xmath10 .",
    "the growing process is repeated @xmath5 times , with the graphs obtained in the limit @xmath11 . figures  [ flower ] and  [ fractal ] show the growth process of two networks for two limiting cases of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .    .",
    "]    . ]",
    "now we compute some related quantities such as the number of total nodes and edges in @xmath14 , called network order and size , respectively .",
    "let @xmath15 be the number of nodes generated at step @xmath5 , and @xmath16 the total number of edges present at step @xmath5",
    ". then @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "by construction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , we have @xmath19 ( @xmath4 ) . on the other hand , each existing edge at a given step will yield two new nodes at next step , this leads to @xmath20 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "then the number of total nodes @xmath21 present at step @xmath5 is @xmath22 the average node degree after @xmath5 iterations is @xmath23 , which approaches 3 for large @xmath5 .",
    "when a new node @xmath24 is added to the networks at a certain step @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , it has a degree of 2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath27 the degree of node @xmath24 at time @xmath5 . by construction",
    ", the degree @xmath27 evolves with time as @xmath28 .",
    "that is to say , the degree of node @xmath24 increases by a factor 2 at each time step .",
    "thus , the degree spectrum of the networks is discrete . in @xmath14",
    "all possible degrees of nodes is 2 , @xmath29 @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; and the number of nodes with degree @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , all class of networks @xmath14 have the same degree sequence ( thus the same degree distribution ) in the full range of @xmath2 .",
    "since the degree spectrum of the networks is not continuous , it follows that the cumulative degree distribution  @xcite is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of nodes whose degree is not less than @xmath38 .",
    "when @xmath5 is large enough , we find @xmath39 .",
    "so the degree distribution @xmath40 of the networks follows a power - law form @xmath41 with the exponent @xmath42 , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "notice that the same degree exponent has been obtained in the famous ba network  @xcite .      by definition , the clustering coefficient  @xcite of a node @xmath24 with degree @xmath43",
    "is given by @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 is the number of existing triangles attached to node @xmath24 , and @xmath46 is the total number of possible triangles including @xmath24 .",
    "the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average over all individual @xmath47 . by construction , there are no triangles in @xmath14 , so the clustering coefficient of every node and their average value in @xmath14 are both zero .",
    "let @xmath48 represent the shortest path length from node @xmath24 to @xmath49 , then the average path length @xmath50 of @xmath14 is defined as the mean of @xmath48 over all couples of nodes in the network : @xmath51 where @xmath52    denotes the sum of the shortest path length between two nodes over all pairs .    for general @xmath2 , it is difficult to derive a closed formula for the apl @xmath50 of @xmath14 .",
    "but for two limiting cases of @xmath13 and @xmath12 , both the networks are deterministic , we can obtain the analytic solutions for apl .",
    "case that highlights self - similarity : the graph after @xmath53 construction steps , @xmath54 , is composed of four copies of @xmath14 denoted as @xmath55 @xmath56 , which are connected to one another as above . ]      in the special case ( see fig .  [ flower ] ) , the networks are reduced to the @xmath57-flower proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this limiting case of network has a self - similar structure that allows one to calculate @xmath50 analytically .",
    "the self - similar structure is obvious from an equivalent network construction method : to obtain @xmath54 , one can make four copies of @xmath14 and join them in the hub nodes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ copy ] , network @xmath54 may be obtained by the juxtaposition of four copies of @xmath14 , which are consecutively labeled as @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "then we can write the sum @xmath62 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the sum of length over all shortest paths whose end points are not in the same @xmath3 branch .",
    "the paths that contribute to @xmath64 must all go through at least one of the four _ connecting nodes _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ copy ] ) at which the different @xmath14 branches are connected .",
    "the analytical expression for @xmath64 , called the length of crossing paths , is found below .",
    "denote @xmath69 as the sum of length for all shortest paths with end points in @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath70 and @xmath71 meet at a connecting node , @xmath69 rules out the paths where either end point is that shared connecting node .",
    "for example , each path contributed to @xmath72 should not end at node @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath70 and @xmath71 do not meet , @xmath69 excludes the paths where either end point is any connecting node .",
    "for instance , each path contributed to @xmath73 should not end at nodes @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "then the total sum @xmath64 is @xmath74 the last term at the end compensates for the overcounting of certain paths : the shortest path between @xmath65 and @xmath67 , with length @xmath75 , is included in @xmath76 and @xmath77 ; the shortest path between @xmath66 and @xmath68 , also with length @xmath75 , is included in both @xmath72 and @xmath78 .    by symmetry , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 in order to find @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we define quantity @xmath82 as @xmath83    considering the self - similar network structure , we can easily know that at time @xmath53 , the quantity @xmath84 evolves recursively as @xmath85+\\left[s_t+(n_t-1)-2\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 4\\,s_t+\\frac{4}{3}(4^t-1).\\label{apl07}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath86 , we have @xmath87    on the other hand , by definition given above , we have @xmath88    continue analogously , @xmath89 where the symmetry property has been used .",
    "after simple calculations , we obtain @xmath90 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ apl08 ] ) and ( [ apl10 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ apl05 ] ) , we obtain after simplification @xmath91 thus @xmath92 using @xmath93 , eq .",
    "( [ apl12 ] ) is solved inductively , @xmath94 inserting eq .",
    "( [ apl13 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ apl01 ] ) , one can obtain the analytical expression for @xmath95 : @xmath96 which approximates @xmath5 in the infinite @xmath5 , implying that the apl shows a logarithmic scaling with network order .",
    "therefore , in the case of @xmath13 , the network exhibits a small - world behavior .",
    "we have checked our analytic result against numerical calculations for different network order up to @xmath97 which corresponds to @xmath98 . in all the cases",
    "we obtain a complete agreement between our theoretical formula and the results of numerical investigation .",
    "for this particular case , our networks turn out to be the hierarchical lattice introduced in  @xcite , which is also self - similar . using a method similar to but a little different from that applied in preceding subsection",
    ", we can compute analytically the average path length @xmath95 .",
    "we omit the calculation process and give only the exact expression as below : @xmath99 equation  ( [ apl15 ] ) recovers the previously obtained result in  @xcite and has been confirmed by extensive numerical simulations . in the large @xmath5 limit , @xmath100 . on the other hand , for large @xmath5 limit , @xmath101 , so @xmath50 grows as a square root of the number of network nodes .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath12 , the network exhibits a ` large - world ' behavior of typical node - node distances .      for @xmath102 , in order to obtain the variation of the average path length with the parameter @xmath2",
    ", we have performed extensive numerical simulations for different @xmath2 between 0 and 1 .",
    "simulations were performed for network @xmath103 with order @xmath104 , averaging over 20 network samples for each value of @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we plot the average path length as a function of @xmath2 . we observe that , when @xmath2 increases from 0 to 1 , the average path length drops drastically from a very high value to a small one , which shows that there is a crossover between small - world and ` large - world ' .",
    "this behavior is similar to that in the ws model  @xcite .",
    "graph of the dependence of the average path length on the tunable parameter @xmath2 . ]",
    "as discussed in previous section , the networks exhibit many interesting properties , i.e. , they have the same degree sequence independent of parameter @xmath2 ; they are scale - free and non - clustered ; and they display a crossover between  large - world \" and small - world .",
    "all these features are not shared simultaneously by any previously reported networks .",
    "hence , it is worthwhile to investigate the processes taking place upon the model to find the different impact on dynamic precesses compared with other networks such as the ba network . in what follows we will study bond percolation , which is one of the most important issues in statistical physics  @xcite .    in bond percolation",
    "every bond ( link or edge ) on a specified graph is independently either `` occupied '' with probability @xmath105 , or not with the complementary probability @xmath106 . in our case",
    "the percolation problem can be solved using the real - space renormalization group technique  @xcite , giving exact solution for the interesting quantity of percolation threshold .",
    "let us describe the procedure in application to the network considered .",
    "assuming that the network growth stops at a time step @xmath107 , when the network is spoiled in the following way : for a link present in the undamaged network , with the probability @xmath105 we retain it in the damaged network .",
    "then we invert the transformation in fig . 1 and define @xmath108 for this inverted transformation , which is actually a decimation procedure  @xcite .",
    "further , we introduce the probability @xmath109 that if two nodes are connected in the undamaged network at @xmath110 , then at the @xmath111th step of the decimation for the damaged network , there exists a path between these vertices . here , @xmath112 .",
    "we can easily obtain the following recursion relation for @xmath109 @xmath113    equation  ( [ lambda01 ] ) has four roots ( i.e. , fixed points ) , among which the root @xmath114 is invalid , because it is less than 0 .",
    "the other three fixed points are as follows : two stable fixed points at @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and an unstable fixed point at @xmath117 that is the percolation threshold .",
    "the reason for the unstable fixed point corresponding to the threshold is as follows : at any @xmath118 , @xmath109 approaches 0 as @xmath119 , which means there is no percolation ; while at any @xmath120 , @xmath109 approach 1 , indicating an existence of the percolating cluster .",
    "the exact expression of @xmath117 as a function of @xmath2 is @xmath121 interestingly , for the case of @xmath12 , @xmath117 is equal to @xmath122 , which is the inverse of the golden ratio @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) and is the same value as the site percolation threshold for the  b \" lattice discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we present the dependence of @xmath117 on @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which indicates that the threshold @xmath117 decreases as @xmath2 increases .",
    "when @xmath2 grows from 0 to 1 , @xmath117 decreases from @xmath125 to 0 .",
    "thus , in a large range of parameter @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath126 ) , there exists a critical non - zero percolation threshold @xmath117 such that for @xmath127 a giant component appears spanning the entire network , for @xmath128 there are only isolated small clusters .",
    "the existence of percolation thresholds in our networks is in sharp contrast with the null threshold found in a wide range of previously studied scale - free networks  @xcite .",
    "note that since the susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model can be mapped to the bond percolation problem  @xcite , for the sir model on our networks the epidemic prevalence undergoes a phase transition at a finite threshold @xmath117 of the transmission probability .",
    "if infection rate is above @xmath117 , the disease spreads and infects a finite fraction of the population . on the contrary ,",
    "when infection rate is below @xmath117 , the total number of infected individuals is infinitesimally small in the limit of very large populations .",
    "the existence of epidemic thresholds in the present networks is compared to the result for some other scale - free networks , where arbitrarily small infection rate shows finite prevalence  @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ lambda02 ] ) , one can see that for different @xmath2 , the networks have distinct percolation thresholds . as known from preceding section",
    ", the whole class of the networks exhibits identical degree sequence ( power - law degree distribution ) and ( zero ) clustering coefficient , which shows that degree distribution and clustering coefficient are not sufficient to characterize the threshold of bond percolation in scale - free networks .",
    "one may ask why the considered networks have disparate percolation thresholds . we speculate that the diverse thresholds in our networks lie with the average path length , which needs further confirmation in the future .",
    "we have demonstrated that power - law degree distribution alone does not suffice to characterize the percolation threshold on scale - free networks under bond percolation . to this end , by introducing a parameter @xmath2 , we have presented a family of scale - free networks with the same degree sequence and ( zero ) clustering coefficient .",
    "we provided a detailed analysis of the topological features and showed that the model exhibits a rich structural behavior .",
    "in particular , using a renormalization method , we have derived an exact analytic expression for the thresholds of bond percolation in our networks .",
    "we found that finite thresholds are recovered for our networks in the case of @xmath126 , which is in contrast to the conventional wisdom that null percolation threshold is an intrinsic nature of scale - free networks .",
    "therefore , care should be needed when making general statements about the percolation problem in scale - free networks .",
    "it should be mentioned that the model generation of scale - free networks with the same degree sequence is a very common problem in complex network research .",
    "actually , in the study of the impacts of other characteristics ( besides degree distribution ) of scale - free networks on the dynamical processes defined on the networks , the interference of power - law degree distribution should be avoided . in this case",
    ", such a model is necessitated .",
    "traditionally , the interchanging algorithm ( through rewiring two links between four end points ) is frequently used to achieve this goal  @xcite .",
    "but this algorithm may lead to disconnection of the whole network .",
    "we have shown that the scale - free networks proposed here have identical degree sequence and are always connected .",
    "so our networks can overcome above deficiency .",
    "they may be helpful for investigating how other features ( say , average path length ) , other than power - law degree distribution , are relevant to the performance of scale - free networks .",
    "finally , we stress that since we were only concerned with the percolation phase transition point , we merely gave the exact position of the percolation thresholds , omitting some other properties of bond percolation , such as the value of the critical exponents governing behavior close to the transition , the complete distribution of the cluster sizes , and closed - form expressions for the mean and variance of the distribution .",
    "all these are worth studying further in the future , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "_ note added._a relevant publication  @xcite about bond percolation has come to our attention , where the authors showed that different percolation thresholds exist for different networks having the same degree distribution ( not degree sequence as addressed in this present paper ) .",
