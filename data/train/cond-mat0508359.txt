    "the last years have seen an increasing interest in network studies in physics @xcite . despite graph theory",
    "have been a research topic of mathematics and science of computation , the physicists have driven their attention to networks that show distribution of connectivity , @xmath9 , following a power law and that present small world effect : @xmath10 , for @xmath5 a typical network distance and @xmath6 the size of the network .",
    "a recent article @xcite points the difficulty to put together these two aspects in a common broad scale - free framework , it means , a fractal paradigm .",
    "in fact , a real fractal should have @xmath4 for @xmath7 the fractal dimension , and not a logarithm dependence between @xmath6 and @xmath5 . in this work we present a network that have the following characteristics : it is fractal , @xmath4 , it is scale - free @xmath11 for a large range of @xmath12 , and it is complex in the sense of having large clustering coefficient .",
    "the scaling relation @xmath13 is trivially fulfilled for regular lattices where @xmath14 is an integer , the topologic dimension of the space . the complex fractal network",
    "we explore in this paper has a non integer @xmath7 .",
    "recently networks embedded in metric spaces have been investigated in the literature @xcite because of the large applications of networks that effectively occupy a volume in 3-dimensions .",
    "in addition , motived by microprocessors design space - filling networks @xcite have been studied .",
    "we cite these new trends in networks because the distinguished network we analyze in this paper is embedded in a metric space and furthermore it is space filling .",
    "in fact our network has a geometrical inspiration , it comes from a partition of the square .",
    "indeed this network is originated from a singular tiling that has the additional property of being a multifractal partition of the square @xcite .",
    "we follow the previous literature @xcite and call this object the multifractal tiling , @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 tiling was developed in the context of modeling transport and percolation in heterogeneous porous media .",
    "in fact , a broad set of irregular and heterogeneous systems are model in the literature using a multifractal approach .",
    "we cite systems in geology @xcite , atmospheric science @xcite and chemistry @xcite .",
    "oil reservoirs are complex anisotropic structures whose treatment have been challenged science and technique because of its non trivial geometry . inspired in the description of oil reservoirs it was developed @xcite the @xmath0 tiling . in reference",
    "@xcite an exhaustive study of the percolation threshold of @xmath0 was performed , in @xcite a random version of @xmath0 was created , in @xcite some of its percolation critical exponents were found , and in @xcite a numerical study of its coordination number is done .    in this work",
    "we explore the network properties of the @xmath0 , it means its topology , the study of the connections ( neighborhood ) among the cells of the tiling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath15",
    "we describe in some detail the process of construction of the @xmath0 tiling and show its more important properties . in section @xmath16",
    "we show the main results concerning the properties of the network : the distribution of connectivity , the scaling of the the average minimal distance between two sites and the clustering coefficient .",
    "finally in section @xmath17 we present our conclusions , discuss the main implications of our results and compare the properties of the @xmath0 network with other networks in the literature .",
    "the multifractal tiling is a peculiar partition of the square .",
    "it is interesting to think about the @xmath0 tiling in contrast to the square lattice .",
    "the square lattice can be constructed using the following algorithm : take a square and cut it symmetrically with horizontal and vertical lines .",
    "this procedure produces four square cells .",
    "repeat this procedure @xmath18 times inside each new block and you have finally a square lattice with @xmath19 cells .",
    "the @xmath0 object is generated in a similar way as the square lattice above described , but instead of using a symmetric partition we perform horizontal and vertical sections following a given ratio .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we exemplify the five initial steps of the construction of the multifractal for the parameter @xmath20 , or @xmath21 . in [ fig1 ]",
    "( a ) we show , @xmath22 , the initial square that by convenience we assume of size @xmath23 . in ( b ) , @xmath24 , a vertical cut is performed and two rectangles are formed .",
    "we call this a @xmath21 object because the square is divided in @xmath17 parts such that @xmath25 part stays at one side and @xmath16 parts at the other side . in ( c ) , @xmath26 , two horizontal lines are drawn using the same section rate as before . at this level",
    "the initial square generates four rectangular blocks .",
    "using as the area unit a square of size @xmath27 , the largest block has area @xmath28 , there are two blocks of areas @xmath29 and the smallest block has area @xmath30 . in ( d ) and",
    "( e ) , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , the same procedure is repeated inside the initial four blocks . in reference",
    "@xcite it is explored the group of eight possibilities of cutting a square lattice with a given ratio . in this work , as in other papers about @xmath0 @xcite , it is followed the recipe of fig .",

    "these blocks do not have all the same area , we call the subsets of blocks of same area by a @xmath12-set .",
    "it is easy to check that the block area distribution follows a binomial distribution and the number of @xmath12-sets is @xmath35 .",
    "this fact implies that the @xmath0 has the remarkable property : in the limit of @xmath36 the area of its forming blocks follows a multifractal distribution @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of fractal distributions comes from a box counting reasoning : @xmath37 for @xmath38 the number of unitary cells of size length @xmath39 that cover the set of blocks of a given area @xmath40 .",
    "once the initial square is partitioned @xmath18 times , the size of the unitary cell is @xmath41 . for each @xmath12-set",
    "the total area of blocks ( using @xmath39 area units ) is done by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the binomial coefficient that express the number of elements @xmath12-type , and @xmath44 is the area of each element of this set .",
    "we put together all these elements to have the fractal dimension of each @xmath12-set : @xmath45 this distribution show a concave shape with a maximum at @xmath46 . the case @xmath47 is degenerated . in this situation",
    "the subsets of the lattice are composed uniquely by square cells of the same area . therefore the tiling is formed by a single subset of dimension @xmath15 .    in fig .",

    "we explore in detail the network properties of this class of objects .",
    "we start the analysis of the properties of the @xmath0 network discussing its distribution of connectivity , @xmath9 . in fig . [",
    "cum ] we show the cumulative sum of @xmath9 versus @xmath12 for several values of @xmath1 as indicated in the figure .",
    "the option for the cumulative sum instead of @xmath9 itself is due to the strong fluctuation of the data .",
    "[ cum ] confirms the results of a previous work @xcite . for low @xmath12 , typically @xmath49",
    ", the curve suggests an exponential behavior and above this threshold the network depicts a scale - free behavior .",
    "the values of the exponents @xmath50 of the power - law @xmath11 are indicated in table [ tab1 ] for several @xmath1 , trivially the values of @xmath50 are estimated from the slopes of the curve of the cumulative sum decreased by one .",
    "the exponent @xmath50 goes to an asymptotic limit for large @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we observe that in the limit of @xmath2 the @xmath0 tiling gets more symmetric and at @xmath51 the @xmath0 degenerates into the square lattice .",
    "for the regular square lattice @xmath9 is a delta of dirac centered at @xmath52 and the cumulative sum a step function .",
    "[ cum ] corroborates this idea , the skewed curves in the @xmath2 limit anticipate the phase transition at @xmath51 .     and @xmath53 . for @xmath54",
    "the distributions approaches a power - law form .",
    "the exponent @xmath50 controlling the decay of the distributions decreases in the limit of @xmath55 , the full set of exponents is show in table [ tab1].,width=264 ]    we explore the distance characterization of the @xmath0 network in fig .",

    "the opposit limit @xmath55 , which is associated with very anisotropic structures , shows large @xmath7 .",
    "we can not affirm that @xmath17 is an asymptotic threshold , further numerical investigation should test this hypothesis .",
    "we remark that the @xmath0 network does not follow a small world relationship @xmath57 that is common to most of power - law and random like networks .     as a function of n for several values of @xmath1 .",

    "the dispersion of @xmath58 among @xmath1 is not large , the numerics show @xmath59 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath1 , however , show a significant larger @xmath58 .",
    "the discussion about @xmath58 is intriguing once we compare the numerical values of @xmath58 with the clustering coefficient of a random network associated to the @xmath0 network .",
    "an associated random network is defined as a network with the same @xmath6 and @xmath60 of the original network ( we do not compare our results with a random network with a same @xmath9 because such random network would alterate the space filling characteristics that we are interested in ) . for a random network @xmath61 , in the case of our network : @xmath60 is a constant number smaller than @xmath62 and @xmath6 a number that can grow without limit . as a consequence the associated random network has @xmath63 in the limit @xmath64 .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 network has a @xmath58 that is infinitely larger than the clustering coefficient of the associated random network . because of the high @xmath58 and the power - law behavior of distribution of connectivity we call the @xmath0 network a complex network .",
    "as function of n for the same set of values of @xmath1 of the previous figure . , width=264 ]    in table [ tab1 ]",
    "it is shown some parameters related to the @xmath0 network for several values of @xmath1 .",
    "most of these data was already commented in the text .",
    "we focus now on the average connectivity @xmath65 of the network . for all @xmath1",
    "studied we have @xmath66 which characterizes a sparse network .",
    "this is not surprising , since there is a result in topology that shows that for two dimensions the average coordination number of a tiling can not exceed @xmath62 .",
    "the average connectivity confirms fig .",
    "[ cum ] where we can see that the majority of vertices are situated in the range : @xmath67 .",
    "otherwise we note that most of interesting results concerning the distribution of connectivity , in special the power - law behavior , are satisfied only in the range @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0 network , as most of complex networks , also have hubs that determine the distinguished characteristics of the network .    0.5 in    [ tab1 ]",

    "the data corresponding to the average parameters are estimated for @xmath53 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work we explore some properties of a space filling network that come from a multifractal partition of the square lattice , the @xmath0 network .",
    "an analysis of the distribution of the connectivity , @xmath9 , assures that the @xmath0 network shows a power - law tail that is more accentuated as increases the anisotropy of the underlying @xmath0 tiling .",
    "roughly the power - law tail of @xmath9 starts at @xmath70 .",
    "we remark that there is no regular lattice in @xmath15 dimensions with @xmath71 and typical voronoi latices have an exponential small number of vertices in this range .",
    "in addition the @xmath0 network has a clustering coefficient that approaches a constant , @xmath59 , that does not depend on @xmath6 .",
    "this fact is in contrast to random networks that ( for a constant @xmath60 ) have @xmath72 . because the value of @xmath58 is much larger than the value of @xmath58 of the associated random network we call the @xmath0 network a complex network .",
    "the most interesting aspect of the @xmath0 network concerns its fractal behavior . for the average minimal path @xmath5",
    "we observe that @xmath4 for the fractal dimension , @xmath7 .",
    "the simulations show that @xmath56 .",
    "the lower limit correspond to the case @xmath73 where the multifractal tiling degenerates into the square lattice .",
    "in this situation the slope @xmath50 ( from the power law @xmath11 ) increases dramatically , this situation corresponds to the @xmath9 of the square lattice that is of the form of a delta of dirac .",
    "the opposite limit , @xmath74 , corresponding to very anisotropic tilings , presents comparatively small values of @xmath50 .",
    "we point that , diversly from @xcite , the @xmath0 network shows an actual fractal behavior @xmath4 that is obtained without any renormalization artefact . in the reference",
    "@xcite a ingenious procedure is used to calculate two fractal dimensions @xmath75 and @xmath7 .",
    "the first dimension depends on a suitable embedding in a metric space and a box counting methodology .",
    "the second is based on network distance and a mass ( number of vertices ) inside a given radios . in our case",
    ", we have calculated @xmath7 in the standard way , the box - counting , however , depends on the methodology we use to make the embedding of the @xmath0 object .",
    "the simplest embedding is the @xmath0 lattice itself that is a 2-dimensional object and as a result @xmath76 .",
    "note that the multifractal property of @xmath0 appears when we consider the subsets of blocks of same area , if we disregard the area set a bidimensional tilling assumes the trivial topologic dimension , @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath0 tiling is indeed a remarkable mathematical object , from a metric perspective it is a multifractal : it is formed by a denumerable quantity of sets of different areas each one with a given fractal dimension . in a topologic perspective the connections among the vertices ( the cells of the tiling ) form a fractal network .",
    "we remark that regular networks ( generated from lattices for instance ) and the bethe tree satisfy the criterium @xmath78 , but these structures are regular . for the best knowledgement of the authors",
