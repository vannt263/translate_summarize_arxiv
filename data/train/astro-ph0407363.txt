    ", the cooling rate of the gas in complex c is 20 times smaller than the average for the lvcs , implying that the heating and cooling processes are far weaker at large distance from the milky way disk .",
    "the cooling rate found for high redshift dlas by @xcite is @xmath91 dex smaller than for the galactic halo lvcs , but comparable to the cooling rate for the gas in complex c. 11 . many of the dlas have values of / similar to that found in the milky way , suggesting roughly similar amounts of ionized gas to neutral gas .",
    "therefore , we would expect ionized gas in many of dlas to provide an important contribution to cooling .",
