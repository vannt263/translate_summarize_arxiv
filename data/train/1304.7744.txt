    "recently spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effects have become a subject of intense research across many different disciplines in condensed matter physics .",
    "these effects are especially pronounced in 4d and 5d transition - metal compounds whose significant atomic soc is due to their large atomic weight .    the strongly entangled , spin - orbital nature of the localized states are characterized by an effective angular momenta , @xmath2 .",
    "the interactions among the components of @xmath2 are determined by the combination of spin and lattice symmetries .",
    "this combination creates unconventional anisotropic exchange interactions that give rise to various novel properties .",
    "@xcite for example , breaking the spin rotation symmetry permits magnetic hamiltonians that contain terms that are products of different components of spin operators .",
    "such terms , not allowed in the traditionally studied su(2 ) symmetric models , introduce a new source of frustration  @xcite and might drive the system towards quantum spin liquid states .    a prominent model exemplifying these kinds of highly anisotropic interactions is the kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "@xcite the ground state of the kitaev model is known exactly ; it is a spin liquid characterized by anyonic excitations with exotic fractional statistics .",
    "recently , jackeli and khaliullin@xcite suggested that the kitaev model could actually be realized within the honeycomb iridates with general formula a@xmath0iro@xmath1 , since the anisotropic part of the interactions among ir - ions has the same form as the kitaev coupling .",
    "this suggestion has triggered a lot of experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite activity in the study of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and li@xmath0iro@xmath1 compounds .",
    "in a@xmath0iro@xmath1 materials , ir@xmath3 ions are in a low spin @xmath4 configuration with an effective angular momentum of @xmath5 due to strong soc .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian describing the interaction between @xmath2 iridium moments is called the kitaev - heisenberg ( kh ) model since it contains both the isotropic antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg interaction , @xmath6 , and the anisotropic ferromagnetic ( fm ) kitaev interaction , @xmath7 .",
    "the kitaev exchange interaction is generated through the 90@xmath8 ir - o - ir hopping path between @xmath2 kramers doublets and is non - zero only in the presence of finite hund s coupling .",
    "the isotropic exchange via the 90@xmath8 ir - o - ir is canceled due to a destructive interference among multiple superexchange paths . at the same time , the isotropic af heisenberg interaction is suppressed and the only non - vanishing contribution is from the superexchange interaction arising from the direct overlap of the ir 5d orbitals .",
    "the ground state of the kh model can be a spin liquid despite the presence of the direct isotropic exchange .",
    "this is because the kitaev spin liquid is rather stable with respect to the heisenberg interaction @xcite ; it remains the ground state of the kh model for a wide range of strengths of the heisenberg interaction .",
    "exact diagonalization studies @xcite suggest a stability of the spin liquid phase for the model parameter @xmath9 in the range @xmath10 , where @xmath9 is determined such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "even so , the kitaev spin liquid in honeycomb iridates has not been observed yet ; in both na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and li@xmath0iro@xmath1 , magnetic order has been observed at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite moreover for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , the kh model in its original form does not appear to be sufficient to account for neither the zigzag magnetic order nor the spectrum of magnetic excitations that have been measured in neutron scattering experiments .",
    "@xcite    to explain the experimental observations in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , three different modifications of the super - exchange model have been proposed .",
    "@xcite in the first approach ,  @xcite it was shown that the zigzag magnetic order may be stabilized within the kh model by including substantial second and third neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the second approach  @xcite extends the kh model to its full parameter space by including additional hopping processes based on the @xmath13 hopping along the 90@xmath8 ir - o - ir paths .",
    "the main difference between these two approaches is that the role of the kitaev interaction is minor in the first approach while it still plays the dominant role in the second one .",
    "the third approach assumes that na@xmath0iro@xmath1 is significantly distorted from the ideal structure ; here , the trigonal distortion is the dominant interaction while the soc is subdominant .",
    "this third model actually does not contain the kitaev term at all , but it does retain the zigzag ground state as one of its magnetic ground states .",
    "@xcite thus , the importance of the kitaev term in the low - energy physics of the a@xmath0iro@xmath1 compounds remains an open question .        in this paper",
    ", we continue to examine the role of the kitaev interaction in the magnetic properties of a@xmath0iro@xmath1 systems using the kh model defined in both the original  @xcite and the extended  @xcite parameter space .",
    "we argue that the kitaev interaction s main effect is the reduction of the symmetry of the system from the continuous su(2 ) symmetry to a discrete @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "the latter is crucial for the finite temperature properties of quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) iridates since by the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite the 2d magnetic systems with continuous symmetry do not exhibit long - range magnetic order at any finite temperature .",
    "however , there is no such constraint on spin systems with discrete symmetry .",
    "thus , we argue that the kitaev term is responsible for the presence of the long range magnetic order .    we also show that the finite temperature properties of the kh model are similar to those of the six - state clock model .",
    "@xcite the kh model undergoes two continuous phase transitions as a function of temperature .",
    "this gives rise to three different phases : a low - t ordered phase with a spontaneously broken @xmath14 symmetry , an intermediate critical phase , and a high - t disordered phase .",
    "finite size scaling analysis of our monte carlo ( mc ) simulations confirmed that the intermediate phase is a critical kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase with floating exponents and algebraic correlations .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start our discussion with sec .",
    "[ model ] which contains a brief summary of known facts about the classical kh model that will be used in the rest of the paper . in sec .",
    "[ finite ] , we discuss in detail the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "we analyze the discreteness of the low - temperature phase , and then we discuss the criticality of the intermediate phase and show how the finite - size scaling analysis allows us to determine the boundary of the critical phase .",
    "we show that the phase transitions are driven by the order by disorder mechanism , in which thermal fluctuations of classical spins select collinear spin configurations where the magnetic moments all point along one of the cubic directions .",
    "we also demonstrate that at particular points of the phase diagram , for which the continuous symmetry is preserved , the ordered state is destroyed at any non - zero temperature .",
    "the section ends with a discussion of the finite temperature phase diagram of the classical kh model .    in sec .",
    "[ pdextended ] , we analyze the finite temperature properties of the kh model in its extended parameter space .",
    "we show that for the parameters relevant to the na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and li@xmath0iro@xmath1 compounds , the model exhibits a zigzag magnetic order in agreement with experimental findings . in sec.[cubic ] , we show that there is a significant difference between the kh model and the heisenberg model with a cubic anisotropy .",
    "while the later model also exhibits two phase transitions , its intermediate phase is not critical ; it is nematic like . using finite - size scaling analysis , we show that in this case the phase transitions are of the three - states potts and ising universality classes .",
    "[ conclusion ] contains a summary of the obtained results and conclusions .    : in the fm phase ( @xmath15 , dot - dashed green line ) , in the zigzag phase ( @xmath16 , dotted black line ) , in the nel phase ( @xmath17 solid blue line ) , and in the stripy phase ( @xmath18 dashed red line ) . ]",
    "the classical version of the kh model is @xmath19 following the notation of ref . , we denote the effective degrees of freedom of ir@xmath3 ions as @xmath20 , and take the quantization axes along the cubic axes of the iro@xmath21 octahedra .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the three bonds of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the two couplings , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are opposite in sign ; @xmath6 is the af isotropic exchange and @xmath7 is the fm anisotropic exchange .    the exchange constants corresponding to the kitaev and the heisenberg interactions in the kh model ( [ ham1 ] ) can be conveniently described by one parameter , @xmath9 , such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the model then reads as @xmath23          let us briefly describe possible magnetically ordered states of model ( [ ham2 ] ) . for this",
    "we need to introduce four sublattices : @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the classical ground state is the simple two - sublattice af nel order ( fig.1 ( b ) ) characterized by the order parameter @xmath27 @xmath28 denotes the number of sites .",
    "the stripy af order ( fig.1 ( c ) ) describes the classical ground state of the model for @xmath29 and is given by @xmath30 for @xmath31 , the stripy af state is classically degenerate with other magnetically ordered states ( see fig.[fig : cl - energy ] ) .",
    "for example , it is degenerate with fm order ( fig.1 ( a ) ) described by the total magnetization @xmath32 and with zigzag af spin order ( fig.1 ( d ) ) described by @xmath33    the classical degeneracy of the point corresponding to the classical kitaev model is macroscopic and is known exactly ; asymptotically , it has @xmath34 spin configurations .",
    "this was computed by baskaran _",
    "et al _  @xcite by mapping ordered states of the classical kitaev model to a certain dimer covering of the honeycomb lattice whose total number is known.@xcite    because of the presence of the anisotropic kitaev interaction term , the kh model has discrete spin - rotation symmetry for all of @xmath9 except at two points , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . at @xmath35 ,",
    "the kh model reduces to the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with continuous su(2 ) symmetry . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the stripy phase becomes an exact ground state of the model ; it corresponds to a fully polarized fm state in a rotated basis .",
    "this basis can be seen by fixing the spin s direction on sublattice a and rotating the spins on sublattices @xmath37 and @xmath25 by the angle @xmath38 about the @xmath39 , and @xmath40 axis , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : orders](c ) ) .",
    "@xcite it is evident that the fm state has true su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "away from these special points , the symmetry of the kh model is discrete ; it combines the cubic symmetry of both the spin and the lattice space .",
    "in this section we study the behavior of the classical kh model ( [ ham2 ] ) at finite temperature using mc simulations based on the standard metropolis algorithm . in our simulations",
    ", we treat the spins as three - dimensional ( 3d ) vectors , @xmath41 , of unit magnitude with @xmath42 . at each temperature",
    ", more than @xmath43 mc sweeps were performed . of these",
    ", @xmath44 were used to equilibrate the system , and afterwards only 1 out of every 5 sweeps was used to calculate the averages of physical quantities .",
    "we present all energies in units of @xmath6 and assume @xmath45 .",
    "the simulations were performed on different systems with a total number of sites equal to @xmath46 .",
    "the systems are spanned by the primitive vectors of a triangular lattice @xmath47 and @xmath48 with a 2-point basis using periodic boundary conditions .    in our simulations",
    "we compute the following observables : four different order parameters @xmath49 defined in eqs.([order : neel]-[order : zigzag ] ) , corresponding susceptibilities @xmath50 the binder s cumulants @xmath51 and the specific heat @xmath52      at low temperatures , the kh model magnetically orders in either a nel state , @xmath53 , or in a stripy state , @xmath54 , depending on the relative strengths of the kitaev and the heisenberg interactions .",
    "the presence of long range order at finite temperatures requires a discreteness of the order parameter , which means that the direction of the order parameter must also be selected .",
    "this , however , does not happen on the level of non - interacting spin waves .",
    "for both the nel state and the stripy state , the linear spin - wave spectrum has a quasi - goldstone mode at the ordering vector simulating the spontaneous breaking of the continuous symmetry.@xcite the discrete symmetry of the order parameter only appears due to the contribution of higher order anharmonic modes of spin fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations lower the energy of the states whose order parameter points along cubic directions  @xcite and thus removes the accidental degeneracy of the classical ground states .",
    "this gives a six - fold degeneracy of the order parameter manifold which corresponds to the six degenerate minima in free energy .",
    "this is a well known order by disorder mechanism in which spin fluctuations ( quantum or thermal ) remove the accidental degeneracy and select the true ordered state .",
    "the discreteness of the order parameter at all but special points can be revealed from the histogram method in which we record two - dimensional distributions of the projections of the vector order parameter on the ( 111 ) plane .",
    "we use the projection of the order parameter on the ( 111 ) plane because it preserves the cubic symmetry of the model and shows that its degeneracy is related to the orientation of the order parameter with respect to the directions in a cubic crystal . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stereo ] ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) we present , respectively , the low - t distributions of the projection of the vector order parameter on the ( 111 ) plane for four different values of @xmath9 : @xmath55 and@xmath56 .              the six - fold peak structure is observed in the distribution function of the nel and the stripy order parameters for @xmath57 ( fig .",

    "note that the multiple `` quasi''-peaks appear because the computations are performed on a finite size system .",
    "the snapshot for @xmath35 ( [ fig : snapshot ] ( a ) ) shows that a certain direction is chosen in this particular spin configuration but it is not along one of the cubic axes .",
    "this is not in contradiction with the mermin wagner theorem which only precludes the appearance of long range magnetic order at finite temperature .",
    "indeed , there is no long range order for @xmath61 because the spins that belong to the same sublattice are orientated both parallel and antiparallel to the chosen axis .",
    "a similar situation is observed at @xmath36 . here",
    ", spins on each sublattice point along a certain direction which is not along any cubic axes ; thus there is no long range magnetic order at @xmath36 as well .",
    "finally , there is no additional degeneracy of the order parameter related to its real - space structure .",
    "though both the stripy and the zigzag order can have three different bond orderings due to the @xmath62 rotational symmetry of the honeycomb lattice , the direction of the order parameter in spin space is chosen once the pattern of the bond ordering is chosen .",
    "the three types of bond ordering in real space immediately imply three different types of spin ordering in spin space .",

    "two of the processes involve the virtual hopping of @xmath139 electrons through the nearest two oxygen ions . as it was shown by jackeli and khaliulin@xcite , the processes via the upper and lower oxygen ions interfere destructively and the isotropic part of the hamiltonian exactly vanishes .",
    "exchange couplings of neighboring kramers states on iridium ions appear due to the multiplet structure of the excited levels on an ir ion induced by hund s and coulomb couplings .",
    "the third process involves a direct hopping between nn @xmath139 orbitals that gives a finite heisenberg term in the kh model .",
    "all of these processes involve only @xmath139 electrons .",
    "however , there is another possible process:@xcite the intersite @xmath140 hopping along the 90@xmath8 ir - o - ir paths .",
    "this is the dominant pathway in a 90@xmath8 geometry since it involves strong @xmath141 overlap between the @xmath142orbitals on oxygen and the @xmath143 orbitals on iridium ions .",
    "remarkably , these hopping processes also introduce the kitaev interaction , but with a different sign .    following ref .",
    ", we consider the most general extension of the kh model ; both the kitaev and the heisenberg interactions can change sign .",
    "the hamiltonian of the extended model is @xmath144 where the relative strengths of the effective interaction between ir magnetic moments are described by the phase angle , @xmath145 , defined in the interval @xmath146 , and the overall energy scale , @xmath147 .",

    "in addition to the nel and the stripy phases present in the phase diagram ( fig.[fig : phase - diag - alpha ] ) , the fm and the zigzag phases appear in fig.[fig : phase - diag - phi ] in a wide range of values of @xmath145 .",
    "the previously missing zigzag magnetic order is found to occupy almost a quarter of the phase space of the extended model .",
    "our findings are in agreement with the ground state phase diagram of the quantum model ( [ extended ] ) obtained by exact diagonalization.@xcite however , as we already discussed above , the classical model does not support the spin liquid phases present in the quantum model .",
    "the finite temperature properties of the extended model are very similar to the finite temperature properties of the original kh model . both the transition between the zigzag and the fm order and the transition between the nel and the stripy order are first order phase transitions . in the extended parameter space ,",
    "the points with a continuous symmetry are @xmath150 .",
    "the intermediate phase is present for the whole parameter space of the extended model except for the points where the continuous symmetry is restored and at the special points @xmath151 and @xmath148 because of frustration .",
    "the similarities between the finite temperature properties of the original and the extended kh model are not surprising .",
    "the above mentioned 4-sublattice spin transformation,@xcite permits a mapping of the af stripy phase to the fm phase and of the af nel phase to the zigzag phase .    according to the fit of the uniform magnetic susceptibility presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath152 for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and @xmath153 for li@xmath0iro@xmath1 . using these values , we get the following estimates for the nel temperatures : @xmath154 which is equivalent to about 17.7 k for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , and @xmath155 which is equivalent to about 21 k for li@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",

    "this gives the estimates for the width of the critical phase to be about 2.3 k and 3.5 k for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and li@xmath0iro@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we also note that our prediction for two phase transitions are in good agreement with the specific heat data obtained for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and li@xmath0iro@xmath1.@xcite in both works the specific heat data show the anomaly above the nel temperature to be at about @xmath159k , indicating the presence of a higher temperature transition .",

    "the positive sign of the anisotropy , @xmath164 , determines that spins tend to align along the cubic axes and not in the diagonal directions of the lattice which corresponds to @xmath165 . because of the cubic anisotropy , the model ( [ hamcubic ] ) shows no full rotational symmetry .",
    "the spin projections in the ( 111 ) plane again will favor six directions as in the case of the kh model . here",

    ", we did not observe any critical phase ; instead , the @xmath14 symmetry is broken in the following two steps .",
    "after lowering the temperature , the @xmath168 symmetry is broken first at @xmath169 ; the system still remains paramagnetic since the expectation value of @xmath170 . in the second step ,",
    "the remaining @xmath171 symmetry is broken at the temperature @xmath172 and the system acquires long - range magnetic order .",
