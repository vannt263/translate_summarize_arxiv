    "granular systems are materials formed by conglomerates of macroscopic particles repelling through their mutual contact @xcite .",
    "these , a priori , simple systems exhibit complex collective behavior and physical response .",
    "for example , depending on external conditions , granular media are found in _",
    "fluid _ or _ solid _ phases , with defined characteristic features @xcite . despite the visual analogy with more conventional matter , the nature of these granular phases is far from being well understood .",
    "key to better understanding the behavior and response of granular systems is the study of the mechanisms of energy transport and dissipation .",
    "experiments on elastic wave propagation have shown that the confining pressure @xmath0 controls the speed of sound @xmath1 of the medium @xcite-@xcite , causing it to scale all the way to zero at low pressure .",
    "several works have shown that for high confining pressures the speed of sound scales as @xmath2 , a relation that can be rationalized from an effective medium theory . however , at low confining pressures a much faster power law is observed @xmath3 , whose physical origin still remains unclear .",
    "in general , the complexity of wave propagation in granular matter is evidenced by the coda - like signal spectrum of elastic waves , originated from the scattering of sound with the heterogeneities of the media @xcite,@xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , much of the current understanding of granular mechanics comes from a simple microscopic approach , where granular media are modeled as amorphous packings of soft repulsive spheres @xcite-@xcite . using this simple model ,",
    "the elastic response has been mainly studied in the linear regime , by applying a conventional normal mode expansion of the potential energy @xcite-@xcite . following this normal mode approximation",
    ", different studies revealed that strongly compressed granular media have a vibrational spectrum which follows the debye law , and therefore , their elastic behavior parallels the one of simple atomic solids .",
    "such studies also revealed an anomalous behavior in the elastic response as the pressure on the medium decreases , and the system approaches the jamming / unjamming transition . in this low pressure regime",
    "it was found that the vibrational modes resemble ordinary phonons only below a characteristic frequency @xmath4 , that vanishes as @xmath0 goes to zero @xcite . above @xmath4 the modes are still extended but strongly scattered by disorder , hence their ability to transport energy is impaired @xcite .",
    "this suggests that granular media behave like a continuum elastic medium only above a characteristic length scale @xmath5 ( thought to be related with @xmath4 ) which diverges as @xmath0 goes to zero @xcite .",
    "however , there is still another source of anomalous behavior in the low pressure regime , which is universally displayed by granular media , but it has received far less attention . as a direct consequence of the nonlinear dependence of the local contact force on the grain deformations ,",
    "the sound speed of a granular medium vanishes as @xmath0 goes to zero @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that the transport of energy in the low pressure regime should not be dominated by phonons .",
    "actually , linear sound does not even exist at the jamming point , and a phononic description here looses its validity .",
    "thus , we can expect that at low pressures the transport of energy in granular media would be dominated by supersonic non - linear waves and shocks .",
    "this peculiar property of a vanishing sound speed at non - vanishing densities , not found in other systems like gases , liquids or solids , was first studied by v. nesterenko , who conceived the name _ sonic vacuum _ for a media whose sound speed is exactly zero @xcite , @xcite .",
    "nesterenko and coworkers mainly analyzed the consequences of the sonic vacuum in the transport of energy in ordered granular chains @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in such cases elastic energy was found to be transported in the form of non - linear solitary waves ( characteristic energy pulses that propagate without shape distortion ) .    despite the results for ordered chains , the mechanisms of non - linear energy transport in disordered granular matter is largely unexplored @xcite . in particular , it is not clear what role the structural disorder of the medium plays .",
    "moreover , no systematic study exist of the expected crossover between the linear waves obtained at strong confining pressures and the nonlinear waves expected to dominate in the low pressure regime , when the granular medium is close to the jamming / unjamming transition .    in this work ,",
    "we study the non - linear transport of energy in @xmath6 disordered granular matter by using numerical simulations and theoretical calculations . here",
    "we focus on the full response of two - dimensional granular packings when they are dynamically compressed by an external piston .",
    "these experiments cause the formation of steadily propagating fronts , without attenuation , nor deceleration , allowing the clear determination of the nature of the associated elastic waves ( which can be linear , weakly non - linear , or strongly non - linear ) . by using this approach ,",
    "we show how the elementary excitations of systems at low pressures are shocks waves rather than ordinary linear phonons @xcite .",
    "we provide a full characterization of these shocks , studying features like shape , propagation speed , and stability .",
    "we also present a simple model which accurately describes the propagation of the shocks , and the crossover from shocks to linear waves , as the pressure increases , or the driving strength decreases .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section ii , we describe the numerical model and the molecular dynamics simulations . in section iii ,",
    "we present the numerical results related to the formation of shock waves by piston compression experiments . in section iv",
    ", we develop an analytical model which captures the speed of the shocks from the nearly linear to the strongly nonlinear regime using conservation laws .",
    "the appendices present an alternative approach to this behavior : a continuum equation of motion ( a simplification of nesterenko s ) is derived in appendix a while its soliton and shock solutions are presented in appendix b.",
    "leads to the formation of a pressure front ( shock wave ) travelling at a velocity @xmath7 . the shock compression process can be seen as a fast transition between two states ( initial and shocked ) of the granular system.,width=6 ]    materials with granularity , as diverse as sand , rocks , ceramics , foams , or emulsion , can exhibit a universal elastic response which is well described by a simple microscopic approach @xcite-@xcite . in all these systems the elasticity is governed by the soft contact interaction between the grains . in the simplest model of frictionless spherical grains ,",

    "similar structures are also commonly obtained through conjugate gradient algorithms . in order to avoid crystallization",

    "we study the transport of energy by means of piston compression experiments . here",
    "an initially jammed configuration is continuously compressed by a piston which moves with a constant velocity @xmath23 in the @xmath24 direction , see the schematic in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemeshocks ] . the subsequent motion of the particles",
    "is obtained by numerical integration of newton s equations of motion using the verlet algorithm @xcite .",
    "we employ periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath25 direction and a fixed boundary on the right edge of the system . in our simulations , the unit of mass",
    "is set by fixing the grain density to unity .",
    "the effective particle young modulus @xmath26 is set to one , which becomes the pressure unit .",
    "these choices ensure that the speed of sound _ inside _ the grain , @xmath27 is one @xcite .",
    "lengths are measured in units of average particle diameter .",
    "piston compression experiments have been previously used in studies of shock waves travelling through different media , like gases , liquids , or crystals @xcite-@xcite . in all these systems a travelling pressure front is observed as a consequence of the motion of the piston . in general , the velocity and shape of the front reveals important information about the mechanisms of energy transport .",
    "simulations at different compression velocities show that piston compression experiments induce the formation of travelling pressure fronts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schemeshocks ] ) .",
    "ahead of the front there is an undistorted static region where the particles remain at rest having their initial overlap @xmath28 .",
    "this initial state is characterized by the original values of pressure @xmath29 , density @xmath30 , strain @xmath31 , and speed of sound @xmath32 . behind the front we find a compressed region where the particles have acquired some kinetic energy .    during their propagation",
    "the fronts remain essentially flat , such that to a good approximation the compression experiments can be described as one dimensional processes .",
    "we present a detailed analysis and discussion of front stability and roughness at the end of the numerical results .",
    "taking advantage of the flatness of the front , we average over the transverse direction @xmath33 , and obtain profiles of the averaged pressure @xmath34 , density @xmath35 , and the @xmath36 component of the particle velocity @xmath37 , as a function of the coordinate @xmath36 . figures 2a and 2b show the advance of a typical front , as seen through averaged profiles of pressure and velocity .",

    "note that at long times the front moves linearly with time ( red line ) , with a propagation speed @xmath7.,width=8 ]    in the steady state regime , the compression front attains a stationary shape described by an empirical fit , drawn as continuous lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : shockphenomenology]a and [ fig : shockphenomenology]b",
    ". in general , the speed of propagation and the shape of the profiles depend on ( 1 ) the degree of non - linearity of the shocks and ( 2 ) the compression velocity @xmath23 . in the next sections , we present a full characterization of such dependencies . by tracking the position of the profiles we find that after transients have died out , the front travels linearly in time @xmath39 , propagating thus with a characteristic constant speed @xmath7 , see fig .",
    "3 . the determination of the propagation velocity allows the identification of the compression fronts with non - linear supersonic shock waves ( @xmath40 ) , or linear waves ( @xmath41 ) .    from the averaged profiles it is clear that the particles behind the front remain in a rather homogeneous state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shockphenomenology]a and [ fig : shockphenomenology]b ) .",
    "this region is well characterized by the average values @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the passage of the front can be seen as a transition in the granular media from an initial ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) to a compressed state ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "this behavior is strikingly different from the profiles observed in crystals or crystalline arrays of grains , where large oscillations in pressure , density , or particle velocity are observed behind the fronts @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",

    "3a shows the propagation of a shock wave obtained though the uniform compression of a granular crystal of hexagonal symmetry with zero pre - compression ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : shockcrystal]b shows the propagation of the shock as seen through the particle velocity profiles . here",
    "the large coherent oscillations are caused by the in - phase motion of the crystalline planes .",
    "note also that these oscillations change with time ( compare grey and black curves corresponding to the time evolution ) , such that the profile never reaches a steady state .",
    "we believe that the underlying mechanism of equilibration producing the homogenization of the profiles in the amorphous systems is intrinsically related with the structural disorder . in our amorphous structures",
    "the disorder prevents any coherent oscillation , such that the peaks are washed out , leaving an homogeneous state .",
    "similar homogenous states are also commonly observed in the compression of other unstructured systems , like gases or liquids @xcite-@xcite .    in ordered systems ,",
    "homogeneous shock profiles are obtained when some source of dissipation is present @xcite,@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : shockcrystal]c shows a steady shock wave profile ( black line ) obtained when a viscous dissipation term , based on the relative velocities between particles , is added to the force : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the viscous coefficient . in this figure",
    "the viscosity coefficient has been chosen high enough to obtain a steadily propagating profile without oscillations . for values of the viscosity coefficient smaller than a critical value ,",
    "the obtained fronts reach steady profiles that still display some residual oscillations ( fig . [",
    "fig : shockcrystal]c , gray line ) . these conclusions , concerning the effect of viscosity on the shock profile ,",
    "are demonstrated mathematically in appendix b.    although our disordered granular structures do not have any source of real dissipation , the obtained uniform shock profiles suggest that the disorder of the system could be playing the role of an effective viscosity @xcite .      mathematically , the propagation of fronts can be studied through the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy : @xmath49_x=0 \\end{cases}\\ ] ] in the case of the propagation of uniform shocks , as found in our simulations ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the ( approximate ) uniformity of @xmath50 , @xmath0 and @xmath38 ahead and behind the shock front allows the immediate integration of the equations , leading to a set of relationships known as the _ rankine - hugoniot jump conditions _",

    "[ frontspeed ] can be grasped from scaling near the jamming point .",
    "figure [ fig : shockprofiles ] shows typical shock profiles observed for weak and strong shock waves . in general , there are two main significant changes in the profiles due to the increase in the non - linearity of the phenomena .",

[ fig : shockprofiles ] shows typical fits for weak and strong shocks .    in order to characterize the features of the shock profiles as a function of non - linearity , we systematically measure shock widths and symmetries for the different compression velocities , on systems with varying initial pressure .",

    "figure [ fig : shockwq]a shows a schematic of the shock profile illustrating the physical meaning of these definitions .",
    ".,width=8 ]    figures [ fig : shockwq]b and [ fig : shockwq]c show the results of shock s width and asymmetry , as a function of the mach number of the shocks .",
    "the width and symmetry of the shocks monotonically decrease as the nonlinearity increases .",
    "note that while the width reaches 50 particles for weak shocks , it reduces to approximately 10 particles for strong shocks .",
    "also it is clear that weak shocks are rather symmetric ( @xmath98 ) and strong shocks are asymmetric @xmath99 due to the slow relaxation behind the front .",
    "we have seen how the passage of the pressure front produces a transition in the granular media from an initial state to a different shocked state .",
    "since the width of the shock waves is generally small , the shock compression process is usually considered to be a fast adiabatic transition @xcite-@xcite ; this allows one to trace out the adiabatic equation of state by measuring the properties of shocks .",
    "generally , the features of the compressed region are studied through the shock adiabat , or _",
    "hugoniot curve _ , which is the locus of final shocked states .",
    "the hugoniot is an adiabatic line in the @xmath100 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shockhugoniot]a ) .",
    "each point in this curve indicates the volume and pressure in the medium in the final shocked states .",
    "note that during the compression experiment , which induces the transition from an initial state @xmath101 before the shock to a final state @xmath102 after the shock has passed , the system does not follow the hugoniot curve in the intermediate states .",

    "[ fig : shockhugoniot]a ) .",
    "as the shock compression process is adiabatic , the hugoniot curve is often used to construct the equation of state of a given material .",
    "following this idea , shock compression experiments have been designed and used for years to study the equation of state of solids and minerals at high pressures @xcite .    , width=8 ]    in our case the shock hugoniot can be directly obtained from the simulations ( by direct inspection of the final shocked states ) , or by using the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions . the conservation of mass and momentum across the shock front eq .",

    "figure [ fig : shockhugoniot]b shows the shock hugoniot curve as obtained by using the rankine - hugoniot conditions . in what follows , we use this numerically determined hugoniot adiabat to study the stability of the shock waves for the case of small disturbances in the shape of the shock front .",
    "the stability of shock waves against shape perturbations has been one of the interesting and important topics of compressible flow .",
    "the theoretical investigations on this topic started with the seminal work of dyakov @xcite , based on a normal mode expansion of the front perturbations , later re - examined and presented in more detail by swan and fowles @xcite .",
    "dyakov performed a linear stability analysis obtaining conditions for shock stability under which a shock wave remains stable , and front perturbations decreases exponentially in time . in this analysis",
    "the stability of the shocks is related with the slope of the hugoniot adiabat , such that a shock wave remains stable whenever these conditions hold @xcite , @xcite : @xmath105 in these expressions the derivatives are taken along the hugoniot adiabat , @xmath106 is the mach number of the shock respect to the material behind the front , and @xmath107 is the slope of the rayleigh line . in general ,",
    "when the lower limit of the above equation is not satisfied the shock wave splits into two waves travelling in the same direction ( splitting instability ) .",
    "the upper limit corresponds to the corrugation instability , where front modulations are exponentially amplified .",
    "note the simplicity and generality of this result .",
    "once the hugoniot curve is known these conditions are general and can be applied to any material . by using our numerically obtained shock hugoniot , we can perform the dyakov test stability analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : dyakov ] shows our results , which suggest that the shock waves studied in this work are stable for the broad range of compressions and impact intensity analyzed .",
    "although the shock waves are stable , the disorder of the granular packings induce the roughening of the front ( compare the fronts of fig .",
    "[ fig : schemeshocks ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : shockcrystal]a ) . in general , in crystalline solids shock front s may also become irregular when travelling through poly - crystalline structures .",
    "although not a proper instability , changes in the speed of sound with the lattice orientation can induce the corrugation and roughening of the shock front @xcite,@xcite . in the amorphous structures considered here , the complete lack of symmetry produces a rather isotropic speed of sound such that irregularities in the front are restricted to a few particles diameters .    in order to analyze variation in front roughnesses",
    "we define the average front position @xmath108 and roughness @xmath109 as : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the position of the front at @xmath33 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : roughness]a ) .",
    "figure [ fig : roughness]b shows the time evolution of the front roughness for shocks of varying mach number .",
    "interestingly , although the roughness of the fronts seems to reach maximum values less than @xmath112 particles , the value of the plateaus clearly depends on the nonlinearity of the wave . in particular",
    ", our simulations suggest that the more pronounced the nonlinearity of the wave is , the less rough its front is .",

    "[ eq : jumpconditions ] .",
    "appendix b gives an alternative derivation .",
    "the first two equations can be used to predict the speed of the shock if we assume that the pressure is given entirely by the elastic forces between the particles .",
    "we describe the system with a one - dimensional one ; then any interface cuts only one pair of particles from each other , and the pressure is just identical to the force between these two particles , and is given by hertz s law , @xmath113 . combining this equation of state with the expression for the density @xmath54 , the mass and momentum conservation conditions ( first two relations in eq .",

    "this comparison shows that eqs .",
    "[ tt ] and [ eq : shockspeedtheory ] are in excellent agreement with the results of our numerical experiments on shock propagation .    despite the good agreement with the numerical results ,",
    "the third jump condition is _ not _ satisfied if we assume the previous expressions for @xmath7 , @xmath23 , and energy density per unit length @xmath115 according to hertz s law . in the simulations the particles also have a random motion superimposed on the average velocity @xmath23",
    "this produces an excess in the pressure and energy of the particles . in this case",
    ", the internal energy has an additional contribution , which can restore conservation of energy .",
    "more precisely , the random motion is described by an effective temperature @xmath116 , and hence the speed of the shock is no longer overdetermined by the three jump conditions because the total number of unknowns , @xmath7 , @xmath56 and @xmath116 is now equal to the number of conditions .",
    "these heating effects should change the shock speed , but not drastically .",

    "we can solve for @xmath119 .",
    "the excess over the hertzian potential energy , @xmath120 is then the thermal energy , which can be expressed entirely in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath56 : @xmath121 when @xmath16 is close to @xmath122 , this energy excess becomes insignificant since this expression approaches @xmath123 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath46 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 is @xmath126 of the potential energy , explaining why our approximation agrees well with the numerics .    to summarize",
    ", the speed of a shock as a function of the compression can be estimated from conservation laws if one neglects the heating of the particles . in the limit where @xmath16 is close to @xmath122 ( as in the hertzian case )",
    "this approximation is quite accurate .",
    "one could go beyond this approximation and determine the exact relation between speed and compression in a shock .",
    "first the thermal contribution to both pressure and energy has to be predicted as a function of temperature .",
    "all the parameters of the shock can then be determined by solving all three jump conditions simultaneously .",
    "in this work , we have used simulations of piston compression experiments to unveil the mechanism of energy transport in granular systems composed of soft frictionless spheres . while at high confining pressures the elastic response of the granular system is basically linear , the low pressure regime is found to be dominated by non - linearities .",
    "thus , for low confining pressures , when the system is close to the jamming - unjamming transition , the basic elastic excitations are supersonic shock waves , rather than linear phonons .    we have presented a detailed characterization of the weakly and strongly non - linear shocks , studying their propagation speed , width , shape , and stability .",
    "it is interesting to note that the propagation speed of shocks does not depend on friction or dissipation .",
    "thus , experiments should focus on this quantity which is only affected by the contact interaction law .",
    "in general , the presence of friction or dissipation will affect other features like the width of shocks .",
    "finally , we developed a mathematical model that correctly captures the universal nonlinear response of granular packings around the jamming - unjamming transition .",
    "in particular , we have used this model to describe the dependence of the propagation speed on pressure and driving .",
    "we conclude by saying that the elastic response of granular matter present unique features , not found in other condensed matter systems like solids , liquids , or gases .",
    "the athermal character of these systems allows the attainment of a state with zero pressure at non - vanishing density , the jamming point , which corresponds to a sonic vacuum . in this state",
    "the response of the system is characterized by a complete lack of linear behavior .",
    "here we have shown how this fully nonlinear state also controls the elastic response of granular system in the low pressure regime .    *",

    "we have @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the equilibrium position of the n@xmath138 sphere .",

    "note that in this case the potential not only depends on the compression @xmath164 , but also on the propagation speed @xmath7 .",
    "we now use this analogy to study the properties of travelling waves .",
    "figure [ potentialsurf ] shows the shape of the potential as a function of compression and propagation speed . in the initial state , the system is undistorted ( @xmath165 ) and the effective particle is located at the extreme @xmath166 , at rest .",
    "for the cases where this initial state is a local minima , the effective particle remains at this initial position for all times .",
    "this means that in these cases steady perturbations can not travel through the system .",
    "thus , in order to describe travelling perturbations the initial state needs to be a local maximum such that @xmath167 , and the speed of propagation needs to satisfy : @xmath168 physically , this condition means that travelling perturbations will propagate at the speed of sound of the medium @xmath169 , or faster .",
    "figure [ potentialsurf ] shows the change in the nature of the initial state , from a local minima to a local maxima , as the speed of propagation of the waves is increased .",
    "now consider a travelling perturbation which satisfies the above condition ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "figure [ solitonsshocks]a shows the shape of the potential @xmath171 for a given front velocity @xmath7 .",
    "far away , the undistorted system corresponds to the effective particle located at the maxima of the potential @xmath172 .",
    "the distortion induced by the passage of the wave can be seen as the particle rolling down the potential .",
    "the effective particle will move up to the turning point , and then the conservation of energy implies that the particle would roll back to the initial state .",
    "this motion of the effective particle corresponds to a solitary wave travelling trough the system with velocity @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ solitonsshocks]b ) .",
    "note that these solitary waves are the only steady state solutions of the system .",
    "the speed of propagation can be obtained from the turning point condition @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the maximum compression due to the passage of the wave : @xmath175}\\ ] ]        the previous analysis shows that in the absence of any source of dissipation the motion of the effective particle conserves its energy , and the only steadily propagating solutions are solitary waves . in that case homogeneous shocks , as found through the simulations in this work , are not possible solutions of the equation of motion .    in order to obtain steady state shock solutions , some sort of dissipation is needed .",
    "in general , the effect of dissipation can be taken into account by adding new terms in equation [ motionphi ] .",
    "for example , if a dissipation term ( due to relative motion of the spheres ) is considered @xcite , the equation of motion of the system will take the form : @xmath176\\,'-4r^2\\eta\\dot{\\phi}''=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a damping coefficient .",
    "now if we look for steady state travelling perturbations with the same procedure as before , we obtain the following equation : @xmath177 here the potential @xmath161 is the same as obtained before ( equation ( [ eq : field ] ) ) .",
    "thus , for this particular form of dissipation , we have explicitly shown that the problem of steadily propagating waves is mapped to the problem of an effective particle moving in a potential , but now the particle also moves under the effect of friction .    in this case , the presence of friction will take out the energy of the effective particle , inducing the oscillation to decay to the minimum of the potential well .",
    "these solutions correspond to oscillatory shock waves ( fig .",
    "[ solitonsshocks]c , black line ) .",
    "if the viscosity is high enough , the motion of the effective particle will become overdamped , and the particle directly moves to the minimum of the potential , without performing any oscillation .",
    "this motion corresponds to traveling regular shock profiles ( fig .",
    "[ solitonsshocks]c , green line ) .    for the shock waves the relation between propagation velocity and induced compression can be obtained by the condition @xmath178 , which corresponds to the minimum of the potential .",
    "this condition leads to : @xmath179 where @xmath56 is the maximum compression after the shock wave has passed . in sec .",
    "iv , imposing two of the jump conditions ( conservation of momentum and mass , but not energy ) produced the same result .",
    "the dissipation term we have added preserves the same two conservation laws , explaining the agreement . in sec .",
    "iv , we justified the disappearance of energy not by introducing friction ( since the simulations did not include it ) but by assuming that the energy is converted to random motion of the particles .",
    "a more accurate treatment of this hypothesis would have to account for some additional thermal pressure .",
