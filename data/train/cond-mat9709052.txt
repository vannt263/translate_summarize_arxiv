    "the existence of a negative viscosity in dispersions of ferromagnetic particles in a nonpolar solvent is a curious phenomenon which has recently been discovered .",
    "it was predicted by shliomis and morozov@xmath0 and corroborated experimentally by bacri @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "its interest is based upon the fact that contrary to what one would expect , the viscosity of the dispersion as a whole diminishes when an applied magnetic field oscillates at an optimum frequency .",
    "as has been known for a long time , the presence of a constant magnetic field prevents free rotation of the dipoles which originates a resistance on the flow of the fluid which increases dissipation . on the other hand ,",
    "bacri @xmath1@xmath2 have shown that the increment in the viscosity due to the rotational degrees of freedom is proportional to the difference between the vorticity and the angular velocity of the particles in suspension .",
    "thus , a magnetic field oscillating at a high enough frequency can impart an angular velocity to the particles greater than the vorticity , leading to a negative viscosity .",
    "one see that the particles gain kinetic energy at the expense of the oscillating field .",
    "this striking phenomena is the motivation for undertaking this investigation .",
    "we have found that the effect described is more general than was thought , considering that it can be applied to any ferrofluid that has a frequency different from the inverse of the brownian relaxation time .",
    "the key point in our results comes from the fact that we work with axisymmetric particles immersed in a suctioning current .",
    "thus , at a low enough temperature , due to thermal agitation , the particles jump back and forth along the axis of the flow , which thereby introduces an internal frequency in the system .",
    "this internal frequency plays exactly the same role as the frequency of the alternating magnetic field in the systems studied by shliomis and morozov@xmath0 and bacri @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "there are examples of systems other than ferrofluids that potentially can show this phenomenology , these are suspensions of gravity dipoles@xmath3 or suspensions of magnetotactic bacteria@xmath4 .",
    "these bacteria , some of them rod shaped , undergo the phenomenon of magnetotaxis .",
    "the bacteria contain iron particles which impart a magnetic moment to themselves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; in section ii we describe the system and perform an analysis of the stability of the equilibrium orientations of the dipoles .",
    "section iii is devoted to the derivation of the relaxation equation for the magnetization . in section",
    "iv we introduce fluctuations in our analysis and , by applying fluctuating hydrodynamics in the space of orientations , we derive the langevin equation for the magnetic moment . in section",
    "v we compute the stress tensor and the viscosity tensor .",
    "finally , in section vi , we discuss our main results .",
    "the system we want to study consists of a dilute colloidal suspension of ferromagnetic rodlike particles immersed in a nonpolar fluid phase .",
    "this suspension flows in an elongational flow and under the influence of a constant magnetic field @xmath5 oriented in the direction of the symmetry axis of the flow , which will be taken parallel to the z - axis .",
    "all of the particles are supposed to have the same magnetic moment    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the unit vector along the direction of the axis of the particle and @xmath8 is the magnetic moment strength .",
    "the velocity field of the flow is given by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the velocity gradient of the flow    @xmath11    with @xmath12 being the rate of elongation .    a suspended particle in the carrier fluid experiences the hydrodynamic torque given by    @xmath13    where the friction tensor @xmath14 is given in terms of its components @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16    @xmath17    here @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the angular velocity of the particle , the drag angular velocity due to the motion of the fluid and the unit tensor , respectively . due to the fact that the only possible relative motion between the ends of the rod is a rigid rotation one",
    "has    @xmath21    where @xmath22 are the velocities of the end points of the rod and @xmath23 is its length .",
    "this expression can alternatively be written as    @xmath24    thus , through a comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a6 ] ) and ( [ eq : a7 ] ) we achieve    @xmath25    with @xmath26 being the rotational operator .",
    "in addition to eq .",
    "( [ eq : a4 ] ) the dipole is acted upon by a magnetic torque    @xmath27    therefore , by taking into account the angular momentum conservation , in view of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a4 ] ) , ( [ eq : a5 ] ) , ( [ eq : a8 ] ) , and ( [ eq : a9 ] ) we can write in the high friction limit    @xmath28    where the potential u , defined through    @xmath29    accounts for the different mechanisms for the rotation of the particle : the magnetic field and the external flow . in polar spherical coordinates this energy can be rewritten as    @xmath30    @xmath31 being the angle between the axis of the particle and the z - axis .",
    "the equilibrium states of the system can be identified through the condition @xmath32 , i.e.    @xmath33    whose solutions , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    the stability of these orientations follows from the second derivative of the potential computed in each of the solutions    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    since @xmath8 , @xmath43 , @xmath15 and @xmath12 are always positive quantities , after examining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a18])-([eq : a20 ] ) we conclude that provided    @xmath44    @xmath45 being a critical field , @xmath34 and @xmath46 are both stable , whereas @xmath36 is unstable .",
    "we then conclude that under these conditions the potential of the magnetic rotor is bistable . for magnetic fields larger than @xmath47 the system becomes stable .",
    "equivalently , we could have considered the presence of a critical value for the elongational rate , @xmath48 , such that for a fixed value of the magnetic field the system is bistable whenever the actual value of the elongational rate @xmath12 overcomes @xmath49 . in the rest of the paper",
    "we will assume that @xmath50 , i. e. we will remain in the bistable region , or in the range of large elongational rate .    to conclude this section we will give some estimates of the critical field corresponding to situations of experimental accesibility .",
    "for particles of magnetite having a volume @xmath51 and an aspect ratio @xmath52 one has @xmath53 , and consequently @xmath54 .",
    "on the other hand , for particles of cobalt with volume @xmath55 and @xmath52 we obtain @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . in both cases",
    "we have assumed @xmath58 . at smaller elongational rate ,",
    "@xmath59 , one has @xmath60 for magnetite and @xmath61 for cobalt .",
    "the relaxation of the magnetic rods can be interpreted as a diffusion process through a potential barrier in orientation space . in this scenario",
    "we can apply the formalism of non - equilibrium thermodynamics@xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 be the angular distribution function that may be viewed as a density in the space of orientations .",

    "equation ( [ eq : b2 ] ) can be rewritten as a continuity equation    @xmath68    which defines the diffusion current    @xmath69    if the height of the potential barrier is large enough as compared to thermal energy @xmath70 , we can suppose that equilibrium is reached independently on each side of the barrier .",
    "thus , the chemical potential can be inferred as being    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the unit step function .",
    "the system is allowed to obtain the global equilibrium due to the presence of a quasi - stationary current @xmath73 , assumed uniform .",

    ", one has the law of mass action@xmath79    @xmath80    which is a nonlinear phenomenological relationship between the quasi - stationary current @xmath73 and the affinity @xmath81 , where @xmath82 .",
    "the phenomenological coefficient @xmath83 is given by    @xmath84    where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we are now prepared to proceed to the deduction of the relaxation equations . to this end , we define the following populations :    @xmath87    and    @xmath88    related by the normalization condition @xmath89    the kinetic equations for @xmath90 and @xmath91 follow after differentiating the eqs .",

    "our approach to deduce eq .",
    "( [ eq : b21 ] ) has been based upon mesoscopic arguments and as we will see in the next section it provides the natural way of introducing fluctuations in the scheme .",
    "it is useful for our purposes to introduce the nondimensional variables @xmath105 and @xmath106 , in terms of which the relaxation time is written as    @xmath107 @xmath108^{-1},\\ ] ]    where @xmath109 must be greater than the unity .",
    "the inverse of @xmath110 gives us a characteristic frequency proper to the system , the jump frequency between the two stable states of the potential energy .",

    "thermal motion of the dipoles inside the carrier fluid produces fluctuations in the population of the minima of the potential .",
    "this fact manifests itself on a mesoscopic level through fluctuations of the magnetic moment .",
    "these can be taken into account by adding a random current@xmath62 to equation ( [ eq : b9 ] ) ,    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is given by    @xmath117    @xmath118 is the equilibrium value of the phenomenological coefficient @xmath83 , which according to ( [ eq : b10 ] ) should be proportional to @xmath119 computed at equilibrium , @xmath120 . by applying the detailed balance principle to eq .",

    "this coefficient can by explicitly written as    @xmath126    and in terms of the nondimensional parameters @xmath109 and @xmath127    @xmath128    finally , in reference to eq .",
    "( [ eq : c4 ] ) , by performing the change    @xmath129    this equation becomes    @xmath130    i.e. , @xmath131 is an ornstein - uhlenbeck process@xmath132 .",
    "as is well known , the stationary distribution for such a process is    @xmath133    which will be used in the next section to compute the viscosity .",
    "in order to calculate the viscosity tensor , we first have to compute the stress tensor .",
    "this quantity has two contributions , one that comes from the solvent , and the other due to the presence of the particles .",
    "the latter is written@xmath134 as    @xmath135    where @xmath136 is the concentration of suspended particles and @xmath23 is their longitude .",

    "it is important to keep in mind that although we are using a stationary distribution , the dynamical effects are taken into account through their dependence on the relaxation time @xmath110 .",

    "one can observe that this viscosity becomes negative for large shear rates and saturates at a positive value .",
    "similar results have been obtained by shliomis and morozov@xmath0 and bacri @xmath152@xmath2 with ferrofluids under an oscillating magnetic field .",
    "negative viscosities in these cases were due to the existence of two characteristic time scales in the system that enter in competition .",
    "one of them is related to the frequency of the alternating magnetic field and the other is related to the vorticity of the fluid . in our case , the dipoles relax to the equilibrium orientations in a time scale @xmath113 , which is shorter than the relaxation time @xmath110 associated with the diffusion through the potential barrier .",
    "the rods are then constantly jumping with a frequency @xmath153 acquiring a net angular velocity different from zero , whose expression is given in the appendix .",
    "the existence of this angular velocity then shows the conversion of thermal energy into kinetic energy for rotation .",
    "this explains why , in our case , the viscosity diminishes .    in looking at fig .",
    "3 one first observes a histeresys cycle described by @xmath154 when @xmath112 varies . during the first stage , when the actual value of @xmath155 is between zero and its maximum value , @xmath154 , decreases from a positive value to a minimum negative value , as occurs in the case analyzed by shliomis and morozov@xmath0 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with those found by them .",
    "the difference between our approach and the one by shliomis and morozov@xmath0 is that the externally imposed frequency can be as large as you want . in our case",
    "the frequency of relaxation , the result of an internal dynamical mechanism , does not grow freely . in the second stage ; @xmath112 is a decreasing function of the shear rate .",
    "this fact is responsible for the particular behavior of @xmath156 observed .",
    "note that , as can be seen in figure 2 , @xmath156 does not saturate to a negative value when @xmath157 .",
    "it tends very slowly to a positive value , as slowly as @xmath112 tends to zero .",
    "our results also agree with the analysis of the phenomenon carried out by rosensweig@xmath158 as well .",
    "in this paper we have shown that in a ferrofluid made from rodlike particles under a constant magnetic field and in a elongational flow , rotations of the particles lead to non - monotonous behavior of the viscosity .",
    "this fact allows us to generalize the phenomenon discovered by bacri @xmath159@xmath2 .    as a consequence of the orientating effect of the flow , the particles rotate with a drag angular velocity @xmath19 that eliminates the degeneracy of the direction of their actual angular velocity in a volume element of the ferrofluid ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : a10 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , all the contributions to dissipation in a volume element add up constructively .",
    "moreover , because the flow is elongational , we can write a potential energy of orientation related to it . this potential is bistable and the addition of a magnetic field breaks up its symmetry , thus magnetizing the system . on the other hand , thermal motion causes jumps between the two stable states of the potential with a certain frequency .",
    "consequently , the particles acquire a kinetic energy for rotation at the expense of thermal energy .",
    "this fact eliminates the rigidity that the system would have if no motion were present , i.e. if the potential time independent were stable .",
    "in fact , this is the way that we interpret the negative viscosity effect predicted for our system .",
    "we have derived the kinetic equations for the population of the minima of the potential and from it the relaxation equation for the magnetic moment .",
    "likewise , by assuming fluctuations of the density of states in the orientation space , we have formulated the langevin equation for the magnetic moment .",
    "this equation describes a ornstein - uhlembeck process whose moments are well known .",
    "the computation of the first four moments allows us to derive the viscosity .",
    "it should be emphasized that the viscosity is computed in the limit of high energy barrier , i.e. for strong rate of elongation .",
    "this is the opposite situation to the case studied in the two previous papers@xmath160 where we covered the weak flow regime , showing an increase of the viscosity .",
    "analogously , modifying the magnetic field without altering the rate of elongation we achieve the same effect , that is , to vary the viscosity .",
    "thus , a possible application of our results is in adaptive dampers .      likewise , the effect that we are studying is only possible in dilute solutions , where each rod can rotate freely without interference by others .",
    "of course in neglecting hydrodynamic interactions among the particles we assume a extremely dilute ferrofluid .",
    "anyway , this is the first step in our study of nonlinear or hysteresis effects in the rheology of ferrofluids suspensions .    the following step will be to assume higher concentrations . nonetheless , to include hydrodynamic and exclude volume interactions in the dynamics of an assembly of rod particles is difficult .",
    "so that , we will model the elongated dipoles by means of rigid dumbbells , such models are well studied in the field of polymeric liquids .    in order to increase the modulation effect of the magnetic field or of the elongation rate on the viscosity , another possibility we are thinking of consists in adding nonmagnetic spheres at high concentration to the ferrofluid .",
