    "this paper is concerned with the general question : `` how do physical systems get to be hot ? '' . by ` hot ' here",
    ", we do not simply mean ` having lots of energy ' .",
    "we shall reserve the word ` energetic ' for that .",
    "rather , we mean the more specialized notion of being in what is known , in ( quantum ) statistical mechanics , as a gibbs state , i.e.  a state described by a density operator of form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a suitable ( usually , of necessity , approximate ) hamiltonian ( assumed to have discrete spectrum ) for the system and @xmath12 is related to the system s temperature , @xmath13 , by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant ( henceforth set to 1 ) . here",
    "@xmath16 stands for @xmath17 and is the normalization constant which ensures that @xmath18 will have unit trace .",
    "( when regarded as a function of @xmath12 it is , of course , the system s ` partition function ' . )",
    "such states are also known as ` canonical states ' or ` thermal equilibrium states ' or ` kms states '",
    ". we shall sometimes refer to them simply as ` thermal ' states .",
    "a possible source of confusion here is the fact that it is sometimes found to be convenient to adopt the fiction that a system which is merely energetic is in a gibbs state at a temperature chosen so as to give it the same mean energy . additionally , given a system with a density of states @xmath19",
    ", it can sometimes be convenient to assign to it a ` temperature ' , @xmath20 , at each energy , @xmath21 , according to the formula @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we wish to underline that we shall not be concerned with such a fiction , nor with such an assignment of an energy - dependent ` temperature ' , here .",
    "rather we are interested in how systems get into states which are _ actually _ gibbs states .",
    "in particular , we are interested in black bodies , and , more particularly , black holes ( in suitable boxes ; here we refer to the remarkable developments in ` euclidean quantum gravity ' and in ( quantum ) ` black hole thermodynamics ' which arose from hawking s pioneering work @xcite on ` black hole evaporation '  see e.g.  the papers on quantum black holes in the collections @xcite ) .",
    "of course , one way for a system to get into a gibbs state is for it to be weakly coupled to a ( much larger ) heat bath which is already in a gibbs state at the desired temperature .",
    "there is a considerable literature , which , with varying degrees of mathematical rigour and generality , shows that , as one might expect , a typical such system will , more or less irrespective of its initial state , approximately get into a gibbs state at the same temperature at late times ",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , what we are really interested in when we ask our general question `` how do physical systems get to be hot ? ''",
    "is :    _ `` how does any physical system ever get to be hot in the first place ? '' _    obviously , an explanation of how one system gets to be hot which invokes the existence of another system ( the above - mentioned heat bath ) which is assumed already to be hot ca nt help to answer this version of our question !",
    "another traditional explanation for the propensity of some systems to be in gibbs states goes along the following lines ( see e.g.  @xcite and , for a treatment of some of the related mathematical aspects , e.g.  @xcite as well as the paper @xcite which recalls this traditional explanation as a preliminary to its main purpose  for which see below ) : one assumes one s system of interest , say described by a hamiltonian , @xmath23 , on a hilbert space , @xmath24 , to be weakly coupled to a much larger ` energy bath ' , with hamiltonian , @xmath25 , on a hilbert space , @xmath26  both hamiltonians being assumed to have a finite number of energy levels in any finite energy interval , with the number of states of the energy bath in an energy interval , @xmath27 , being approximately given in terms of a ` density of states ' , @xmath3 , as @xmath28  @xmath3 being assumed to have some typical , say , power - law form ( see below )  and one assumes the whole system to be in a total microcanonical state . before we explain what we mean by this , we pause to remark , first , that , in order to avoid ambiguous usages of the word ` system ' , we shall , from now on , adopt the word _ totem _ ( short for ` total system ' ) to denote what we referred to above as our ` whole system ' .",
    "so we shall talk about a ` totem ' which consists of a ` system ' .",
    "` s ' , and an ` energy bath ' , ` b ' .",
    "our assumption of weak coupling is then the assumption that the totem hamiltonian will take the form @xmath29 on the totem hilbert space , @xmath30 , and we shall assume further that the coupling term is so weak that it can be neglected for state and energy - level counting purposes . to say that our totem is in a microcanonical state then means to assume it is described by the density operator @xmath31 on the totem hilbert space , @xmath32 , where the sum is over a basis of energy eigenstates for the subspace of @xmath32 consisting of energy levels with energies in an interval , @xmath33 $ ] , which is small , yet large enough for the total number of totem energy eigenstates in this range to be very large , while the normalization constant , @xmath34 ( which is expected to roughly scale with @xmath35 ) is the total number of such basis eigenstates .",
    "we further pause to note that we shall assume throughout the present paper , as is usually assumed for ` ordinary ' physical systems , that both hamiltonians , @xmath23 and @xmath25 , are positive and their densities of states monotonically increasing .",
    "we remark though that , as we will discuss further in section [ sect : moretherm ] , were any of these assumptions to be relaxed , then the prospects for systems to become hot become much less constrained and , in particular , there are ways in which a system can be hot while the totem is in a pure state which differ from the ` modern ' scenarios we discuss below .    proceeding with the above assumptions , the states , @xmath36 , in the sum in ( [ micro ] )",
    "will each take the form @xmath37 and the sum over totem energy levels will become ( see ( [ microsysbath ] ) below ) a double sum over system energy levels , @xmath38 , and energy - bath energy levels , @xmath39 , which satisfy the condition @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the resulting state of the system is then represented mathematically , in the usual way , by the reduced density operator , @xmath41 on @xmath24 i.e.  by the partial trace of @xmath42 over @xmath26 .    to remind ourselves how thermality of our system",
    "can then come about in this traditional explanation , it is instructive first to consider an oversimplified model in which our system hilbert space , @xmath24 , is two - dimensional with only two energy levels with energies @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that @xmath45 and in which the density of states , @xmath3 , of the energy bath grows exponentially  we shall write @xmath46 .",
    "( we shall discuss the case where both system and energy bath both have such a density of states in sections [ sect : exp ] and [ sect : expform ] . )",
    "then we easily see that @xmath41 will be approximately @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the appropriate normalization constant , and this is clearly the same as the gibbs state @xmath49 for @xmath50 for a suitable , normalizing , @xmath16 .    in the full story , where we now assume that also the states of the system are approximately given by a density of states , @xmath2 , it is convenient to assume that @xmath51 is an integral multiple of @xmath35 and locally to slightly distort the spectra of system and energy bath so that their energy levels are evenly spaced at intervals @xmath52 with each system level having degeneracy @xmath53 and each energy - bath level having degeneracy @xmath54",
    "if , as we shall further assume , this can be done in such a way as to maintain the same ` smoothed out ' densities of states , then it will not seriously alter the values of any quantities of interest . choosing a basis within the degeneracy subspace of @xmath24 with each energy , @xmath21 , and labelling its elements @xmath55 , where , for each @xmath21 , @xmath56 while @xmath21 ranges from @xmath35 to @xmath51 in integer steps of @xmath35 ( and similarly for the energy bath ) we then easily have that @xmath42 ( [ micro ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath57 where the sum over @xmath58 goes from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , the sum over @xmath61 goes from @xmath59 to @xmath62 and the sums over @xmath38 and @xmath39 are over values which are positive - integer multiples of @xmath35 and are constrained to have @xmath63 , while the normalization constant , @xmath34 , defined after ( [ micro ] ) , is also given by @xmath64 or , roughly equivalently @xcite , by making the replacement @xmath65 by the approximate formula @xmath66 moreover , @xmath67 times the summand in ( [ sumnorm ] ) or @xmath68 times the integrand in ( [ intnorm ] ) is , for suitable ( small but not too small ) @xmath27 ( approximately ) the number of energy eigenstates for which the energy of the totem lies in the interval @xmath33 $ ] while the energy of the system lies in the interval @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "when our totem is in the microcanonical state ( [ micro ] ) , ( [ microsysbath ] ) , this summand divided by @xmath34 may thus be interpreted as the probability that the system energy lies in this latter interval .",
    "we shall denote it by @xmath70 and call @xmath71 the system s _ energy probability density _",
    "so we have @xmath72 and we notice , in passing , that @xmath73 the reduced density operator , @xmath41 , of @xmath42 on @xmath24 will clearly be latexmath:[\\[\\label{microreduced } \\rho^{\\mathrm{microc}}_{\\mathrm{s}}=m^{-1}\\sum_{\\epsilon=\\delta}^e n_{\\mathrm{b}}(e-\\epsilon ) \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\epsilon ) }    cluttering up our formulae , we drop the ` s ' suffix on @xmath21  also in @xmath55  when there can be no ambiguity . )",
    "one can then show , for a wide range of ` realistic ' energy - bath models that , in the limit as the energy bath gets large while the system remains unchanged , @xmath75 will converge to a thermal state at an inverse temperature @xmath12 given , @xcite , in terms of the large - size behaviour of the energy bath s density of states .",
    "in particular , and specializing now to a case ( cf .  again e.g.",
    "@xcite ) that will interest us further below , if the density of states , @xmath3 , has the typical power - law form of ordinary ( radiationless ) matter : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a constant and @xmath78 is an ` avogadro - sized ' number which could stand e.g.  for ` 3/2 times the number of molecules ' in the energy bath or the ` number of oscillators ' in the energy bath ( see again e.g.  @xcite for the origin of the @xmath79 etc . )  etc .  then",
    ", in the limit as the total energy , @xmath51 , of the totem gets larger while the size of the energy bath gets larger  in the sense that @xmath78 gets larger  while the system remains unaltered and @xmath80 converges to a constant , @xmath12 , @xmath41 will converge to a thermal state at inverse temperature @xmath12 ",
    "i.e.  to the @xmath81 of equation ( [ sgibbs ] ) below . in the special case",
    "that the system has a density of states also of power - law form ( see ( [ sigmasbpower ] ) ) we shall provide a proof of this result , in passing , in section [ sect : power ] below which is particularly instructive in relation to our present purposes .",
    "see the last paragraph in section [ sect : power ] .",
    "so , in this way , one shows that a small system in contact with a large energy bath with a suitable density of states will approximately be in a gibbs state when the totem is in a microcanonical state .",
    "above , a gibbs state ( [ gibbs ] ) of our system will obviously take the form ( assuming again the spectrum to be slightly distorted as explained before equation ( [ microsysbath ] ) ) @xmath82 ) to ( [ intnorm ] ) ) @xmath83    however , this traditional explanation of the origin of thermality ( of a small system ) is also unsatisfactory since it still begs the question of how the totem got into a microcanonical state . what would really be desirable would be an explanation of the origin of thermality consistent with the basic assumption of standard quantum mechanics that the total state of a closed system ( in our case , our totem ) is a pure state ",
    "i.e.  in the language of density operators , the projector , @xmath84 , onto a single vector , @xmath85 , in the closed system s ( /our totem s ) hilbert space .    such an explanation has , in fact , recently been given by a number of authors again for the case of a small system in contact with a large energy bath .",
    "see especially the paper @xcite entitled ` canonical typicality ' by goldstein , lebowitz et al .  and also the references therein .",
    "the result of that paper  when specialized to our power - law density of states model ( [ sigmabpower ] )  amounts to the statement that if , for a ` system ' and ` energy bath ' as considered above , one takes a random pure state with energy in the energy range @xmath33 $ ] , then , again imagining the energy bath to get larger while @xmath80 converges to @xmath12 , for sufficiently large @xmath51 , the reduced density operator of the system , @xmath86 , will , with very high probability , be very close to a gibbs state ( i.e.  the @xmath81 of ( [ sgibbs ] ) ) at inverse temperature @xmath12 .",
    "we shall also re - obtain this result ourselves as a limiting case of one of our main new results in section [ sect : ans ] .",
    "the precise mathematical statement can be inferred by inspecting the paper @xcite and/or see the more general rigorous result proved by popescu et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "goldstein , lebowitz et al .",
    "define what they mean here by ` random ' and by ` probability ' by taking the natural measure on the set of unit vectors of the relevant hilbert space  assumed to have large , but finite , dimension @xmath34  by thinking of it as a ( @xmath87)-dimensional real unit sphere and taking the natural invariant measure induced on that by haar measure on the orthogonal group . in doing so , they follow pioneering work of lubkin @xcite who , in 1978 , after introducing @xcite this use of this measure ( following lubkin and subsequent authors , we shall simply call it ` haar ' measure from now on ) showed that a randomly chosen pure density operator , @xmath88 ( without any restriction on energy or anything else ) on the tensor - product hilbert space , @xmath89 , of a pair of quantum systems ",
    "@xmath90 being @xmath91-dimensional and @xmath92 being @xmath48-dimensional  will , for fixed @xmath91 and @xmath93 , have , with high probability , a reduced density operator , @xmath94 , on @xmath90 , which is close to the maximally mixed density operator  with components , in any hilbert space basis , @xmath95 .",
    "we shall discuss further this result of lubkin and some related developments in section [ sect : prelim ] at the beginning of part  2 since they will be needed as a preliminary towards our argument for equation ( [ purereduced ] ) and the related claimed proposition in section [ sect : ans ] .",
    "in essence , one might characterize the relation between lubkin s work and the work , @xcite , of goldstein , lebowitz et al .  by saying that lubkin obtained microcanonicality of a small subsystem from randomness of a totem pure state while goldstein , lebowitz et al .",
    "obtained canonicality of a small subsystem when an , otherwise random , totem pure state is constrained to have a definite energy .",
    "( popescu et al .",
    "@xcite then generalized these developments by allowing for more general constraints , and also made them mathematically rigorous . )",
    "the modern ( see endnote @xcite ) results , @xcite , of goldstein , lebowitz et al .  and of popescu et al .",
    "are an advance on the traditional results in that they replace the assumption of a total microcanonical state by the assumption of a total pure state .",
    "however , they still share the limitation of the traditional approach of still only being capable of explaining how , at most , only a small subsystem of a given ` large ' totem can get to be ( approximately ) thermal .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper will be to explore to what extent , and/or under what altered circumstances , this limitation can be overcome .",
    "our main motivation relates to the theory of quantum black holes .",
    "black holes are a puzzle in relation to the above results if one believes , as seems compelling , that the totem consisting of a black hole in equilibrium with its atmosphere in a box at approximately fixed energy is completely ( approximately ) thermal @xcite .      in such black hole equilibrium states",
    "we may roughly ( albeit not exactly , see endnote ( iii ) in @xcite ) identify the black hole itself with ` gravity ' and the atmosphere with ` matter ' . in an earlier proposal ( see @xcite and",
    "especially endnotes ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( v ) in @xcite ) of the author ( which predated the work @xcite in a more general , but non - gravitational @xcite , context of goldstein , lebowitz et al .",
    "and of popescu et al .",
    "by around seven years ) a radically - different - from - usual hypothesis was put forward as to the nature of quantum black hole equilibrium states according to which the total state is a pure state ( in line with what we are calling here the ` modern ' approach  see endnote @xcite  but in contrast to the usual assumption in work on quantum black holes that it is a gibbs state at the hawking temperature ) while the reduced state of the gravitational field alone and also the reduced state of the matter fields alone are each thermal ( i.e.  each gibbs states ) at the appropriate hawking temperature ( see below ) .",
    "( here we use the word ` matter ' to include e.g.  the electromagnetic field . ) below , we shall sometimes call such a total pure state _ bithermal_. this hypothesis formed , in turn , just a part of our wider hypothesis @xcite ( which we shall sometimes refer to here as our _ matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis _ ) according to which , quite generally , one should always take into account the quantum gravitational field as well as all matter fields in describing the full dynamics of any physically closed totem , and that , while the state of the totem is always pure and evolves unitarily , the ` physically relevant ' quantum state is to be identified with the reduced density operator of the matter alone and , concomitantly ( see section [ sect : entropy ] and , in particular , endnote @xcite ) , the physical entropy of a closed totem is to be identified with its _ matter - gravity entanglement entropy_. interpreted according to this wider hypothesis , our hypothesis that quantum black hole equilibrium states are bithermal then implies that , _ physically _ , such states are _",
    "completely thermal_. we remark that , given our wider hypothesis , what is required for this complete thermality is , of course , just thermality of the reduced state of the matter",
    ". however , there are strong reasons ( particularly the fact @xcite that the euclideanized schwarzschild metric is periodic in imaginary time with period @xmath96 ) for believing that the mathematical nature of the reduced state of gravity will also be thermal and this is what we have assumed above and will continue to assume in the remainder of this section and in section [ sect : bhimplications ] .    to summarize and also to recall the relevant formulae : while we accept the ( conventional ) belief that , in black hole equilibria , both matter and gravity are each separately thermal at the hawking temperature , @xmath97 , we propose ( unconventionally in comparison to other work on quantum black holes ) that the total state of matter - gravity is pure ( rather than itself being a thermal state ) .",
    "the thermality of each of the reduced states ( i.e.  of matter and of gravity separately ) will then arise as the result of entanglement between matter and gravity in the pure totem state .",
    "we shall refer to this picture of black hole equilibrium states as our _ entanglement picture of black hole equilibrium_. ( we shall assume in section [ sect : bhimplications ] and in @xcite that , in this picture , the overall ( i.e.  totem ) state of black hole equilibrium is not only pure but also close to an energy eigenstate . ) we further emphasize that while this proposal is unconventional when compared to other work on quantum black holes , it seems to fit well with modern approaches ( such as those of @xcite ) towards understanding the origin of thermality which have recently been proposed in non - gravitational contexts . here",
    ", we recall that the hawking temperature , @xmath97 , is given @xcite , in the case of a schwarzschild ( i.e.  spherical , uncharged ) black hole of mass @xmath98 , by @xmath99 ( in general the surface gravity multiplied by @xmath100 ) . here",
    ", @xmath101 denotes newton s constant and we set @xmath102 and @xmath103 to 1 .",
    "moreover , we accept the conventional belief that the physical entropy  again in the spherical , uncharged case  has the hawking value of @xmath104 ( in general , one quarter of the area of the event horizon , divided by @xmath101 ) and what is new about our proposal is our claim that this entropy - value should ultimately be explainable as the matter - gravity entanglement entropy of a pure state of the overall matter - gravity totem .",
    "finally , we note that our matter gravity entanglement hypothesis and our entanglement picture of black hole equilibrium also offer a natural resolution to the information loss puzzle @xcite .",
    "this puzzle arose because , as long as it was believed that black holes were correctly described by mixed states , then , in a dynamical process in which black holes were formed from collapsing stars etc .",
    ", it appeared that an initial pure state would dynamically evolve into a mixed state , contradicting unitarity . on the other hand",
    ", there is no difficulty in reconciling our matter - gravity entanglement hypthesis with a unitary quantum mechanical time evolution and , once we identify entropy as matter - gravity entanglement entropy , this is entirely consistent with increasing entropy ( i.e.  information loss ) .",
    "we note that this proposed resolution to the information loss puzzle is , in fact , just a special case of our proposed resolution to the second law puzzle @xcite .      the specific question we shall endeavour to answer in this paper assumes , as its basic setting , that a totem be given which consists of a pair of weakly coupled systems , s and b , each with its own hilbert space , @xmath24 and @xmath26 , and each with its own density of states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "our specific question is then :    _ if the systems , s and b , are _ * of comparable size * @xcite _ , _ _ what modifications need to be made either to the traditional ` total microcanonical state ' approach or , more relevantly since we believe it to be a step closer to the right answer , to the more modern ` total pure state ' approach of goldstein , lebowitz et al .  and of popescu",
    "et al .  and others , as described above , so as to ensure that when the totem has a total state with energy in an interval @xmath33 $ ] , the reduced states of s and b will each likely be approximately thermal states ? ( and , in particular , in the ` total - pure state approach ' , the total state will likely be approximately bithermal ) . _",
    "( what is meant here by ` comparable size ' has , of course , to be encoded into the functional form of the densities of states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "how this is done will be clear from the specific examples we discuss . )",
    "we hope the answers we obtain below may be of interest in their own right and that the formalism we deploy to answer them may find a variety of other applications .",
    "but the immediate application we have in mind is to the theory of quantum black holes . in section [",
    "sect : bhimplications ] and in our two companion papers , @xcite , we shall argue that our answers help to strengthen the case for , and give concrete form to , our matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis and particularly our entanglement picture of black hole equilibrium discussed in section [ sect : blackholes ] .",
    "the key to answering our specific question , in the ` traditional total microcanonical state ' approach is the formula ( [ microreduced ] ) which we already gave above for the reduced density operator , @xmath41 , on s.    we claim that the appropriate replacement for this formula in the ` modern total - pure state approach ' is @xmath105 on the right hand side of this equation , we continue to assume the spectrum to be slightly distorted in the way we explained before equation ( [ microsysbath ] ) , @xmath106 and @xmath107 to be defined as in ( [ degdenss ] ) and ( [ degdensb ] ) and the sums to be over integral multiples of @xmath35 , and we also continue to assume , as will be the case in our examples in part  1 , that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are monotonically increasing functions  defining @xmath108 to be the energy value at which @xmath109 . when @xmath110 , the @xmath111 then denote the elements of an orthonormal basis of an @xmath112-dimensional subspace of the ( @xmath113-dimensional ) energy-@xmath21 subspace of @xmath24 which will depend on @xmath85 .",
    "as we shall see , this dependence on @xmath85 will not matter for the developments in part  1 .",
    "we will postpone a full explanation of the way in which the subspace depends on @xmath85 to section [ sect : main ] in part  2 .",
    "it is important to notice that , as is easy to check , the constant , @xmath34 , by which one needs to divide in order to normalize ( [ purereduced ] ) has the same value , given by ( [ sumnorm ] ) and ( [ intnorm ] ) ( and as explained after those equations , equal to the total number of states of the totem with energy in the interval @xmath33 $ ] ) as the constant , @xmath34 , by which one needs to divide in order to normalize ( [ microreduced ] ) .",
    "moreover , while the states , @xmath41 and @xmath114 , are clearly ( usually ) very different , both states share the same energy probability density , @xmath71 ( [ enprobdens ] ) .",
    "( there is of course a similar pair of equations to ( [ microreduced ] ) and ( [ purereduced ] ) with obvious reversals of the letters ` s ' and ` b ' and , in the case of ( [ purereduced ] ) , with @xmath108 replaced by @xmath115 . )    we now claim that the sense in which ( [ purereduced ] ) is the appropriate replacement for ( [ microreduced ] ) in the modern approach is then made clear by the following proposition , our argument for the correctness of which is given in ( and is the main purpose of ) part  2 :    * proposition .",

    "( and a similar statement of course holds with system , s , replaced by bath , b. ) _    what makes this proposition particularly useful is the fact that , while the @xmath112-dimensional subspaces ( spanned by the @xmath111 ) of @xmath116 will depend on the choice of @xmath85 ( in a way which we shall explain in section [ sect : main ] in part  2 where we point out , by the way , that they might themselves be said to be ` random subspaces ' ) as is easy to see and as we shall illustrate in part  1 , the values of physical quantities of interest , such as the mean energy and the von neumann entropy of the system s ( see ( [ svn ] ) below and section [ sect : entropy ] ) calculated using @xmath114 , do not depend on which @xmath112-dimensional subspaces they are . therefore we can conclude that , to the extent that the approximation of @xmath117 by @xmath114 is good ( and we shall argue in part  2 that , in our situations of interest , and when it is used for the purpose of calculating mean energy and entropy , it is very good ) the actual values of these quantities must ( with a very high probability ) be largely independent of the choice of @xmath85 ! ( aside from mean energy , in fact we expect the entire energy probability density function , @xmath71 , will most likely be close to that of @xmath114 and hence also , similarly , for higher moments of the energy . )    above , we recall that , for an arbitrary density operator , @xmath118 , the von neumann entropy is given by the formula @xmath119    we remark that it is easy to see from a comparison between ( [ microreduced ] ) and ( [ purereduced ] ) that the above proposition implies the ` canonical typicality ' result @xcite of goldstein , lebowitz et al . , thus fulfilling our promise in section [ sect : intro ] to re - obtain the latter . for , in the relevant limit ( see after equation ( [ sigmabpower ] ) )",

    "we first observe that , whatever the densities of states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( provided only they are monotonically increasing ) as long as the total energy , @xmath51 , of our totem is finite , then , of course neither of the density operators , @xmath41 ( [ microreduced ] ) and @xmath114 ( [ purereduced ] ) , can be exactly thermal . to see this easily",

    "a fuller description of the contents of part  2 is given towards the end of section [ sect : prelim ] .",
    "if s and b have densities of states as in ( [ sigmasbpower ] ) then , by ( [ intnorm ] ) and the remarks in the subsequent paragraph , we have that @xmath34 , i.e.  the total number of totem states with energy in @xmath33 $ ] , is given by @xmath142 which can be rewritten @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the usual beta function ( see e.g.  @xcite )  related to the gamma and factorial functions by @xmath145 ( for fractional arguments , we take @xmath146 to mean @xmath147 . ) on the other hand , the number of such totem states with system energy in an interval @xmath148 $ ] will , for suitable @xmath27 , be well - approximated by @xmath149 @xmath150 thus , combining ( [ mpower ] ) , ( [ psdeltapower ] ) and ( [ betagamma ] ) we have that @xmath151 where ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath152 is , when @xmath48 and @xmath15 are integers , the binomial distribution function which has the famous interpretation as the probability that @xmath48 ` bernoulli ' trials , each with probability @xmath153 for success and @xmath154 for failure , result in @xmath15 successes and @xmath155 failures . in order to take advantage of the insight afforded by this connection with probability theory we shall ( with negligible error when @xmath124 and @xmath78 are large ) assume from now on that @xmath124 and @xmath78 , if not already integers , are replaced by their nearest integers .",
    "first we notice that we may use the well - known connection between the binomial and the poisson distribution to give an alternative derivation of the fact that , in the limit as @xmath51 and @xmath78 grow while @xmath124 remains constant and the ratio @xmath80 converges to @xmath12 , s s energy probability density , @xmath71 ( [ pspower ] ) , converges to the gibbs energy probability density @xmath156 ( see ( [ psgibbs ] ) and ( [ zs ] ) ) with inverse temperature @xmath157 for @xmath0 as in ( [ sigmasbpower ] )  the latter gibbs energy probability density being given explicitly by @xmath158 as one sees from ( [ psgibbs ] ) and ( [ sigmasbpower ] ) after easily checking from ( [ zs ] ) and ( [ sigmasbpower ] ) that @xmath159 this convergence result is of course a special case ( i.e.  the case where s , as well as b , has a power - law density of states ) of an easy corollary both of the traditional thermality result ( on the total microcanonical state approach ) and ( bearing in mind the equality of the energy probability density for both ( [ microreduced ] ) and ( [ purereduced ] ) ) of the ` canonical typicality ' result of goldstein lebowitz et al .",
    "( on the ` modern ' total pure state approach ) which , as we discussed in section [ sect : intro ] , both hold in the same limit ; we shall see shortly that the alternative proof which we next give for this corollary easily implies an alternative proof to the traditional thermality result itself and thus also , by a remark we made in section [ sect : ans ] to an alternative argument for ` canonical typicality ' when the system and energy - bath densities of states both have power - law form .    as feller puts it in @xcite , `` if @xmath48 is large and @xmath153 is small , whereas the product @xmath160 is of moderate magnitude '' then the binomial distribution goes over to the poisson distribution , i.e.@xmath161 in particular ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) for fixed @xmath15 , the right hand side of ( [ feller ] ) is the limit of @xmath162 as @xmath163 while @xmath164 in such a way that @xmath165 . from this , and ( [ pspower ] ) , we easily conclude that the limit , as @xmath166 while @xmath167 with @xmath124 fixed , of @xmath71 is equal to @xmath156 ( [ psgibbspower ] ) .",
    "so , to summarize , in the appropriate limit of a large energy bath , the energy probability density of s goes over to the energy probability density of the appropriate gibbs state ; @xmath168 we remark that , by inspecting ( [ psgibbs ] ) and ( [ zs ] ) this is easily seen to be equivalent to the statement that , in the same limit , @xmath169 and , by inspecting ( [ microreduced ] ) and ( [ sgibbs ] ) , one easily sees that this implies that in the same limit @xmath170 thus providing the alternative proof , which we promised in section [ sect : intro ] , of the traditional result on the thermality of a small system in contact with an energy bath in the traditional limit of a large energy bath , in the case where both the energy bath , b , and system , s , have a power - law density of states ( and by our remark in section [ sect : ans ] thus also providing an alternative proof of ` canonical typicality ' for such s and b ) .",
    "we will now demonstrate , however , that , when s and b are _ of comparable size _",
    ", then , if they both have power - law densities of states as in ( [ sigmasbpower ] ) , both the total microcanonical state approach and the ` modern ' approach ( i.e.  with a total pure state ) predict that the reduced density operators of each of s and b will be quite different from thermal",
    "! we shall show this by showing that the energy probability density of each of s and b ( which we again recall from the paragraph after ( [ purereduced ] ) is the same in each approach ) will have a quite different form from the thermal form of @xmath156 .",
    "first we notice that , when @xmath15 is a fixed fraction , @xmath171 , of @xmath48 ( in such a way that @xmath172 and also @xmath171 is an integer ) then , if @xmath153 and @xmath48 are regarded as fixed , the binomial distribution function ( [ binomial ] ) @xmath173 is maximized when @xmath174 and we easily obtain the approximation @xcite ( now writing @xmath175 ) @xmath176 ( [ binomapprox ] ) is obtained by expressing the left hand side in terms of factorials and powers according to ( [ binomial ] ) .",
    "we then adopt stirling s approximation , @xmath177 for each of the factorials and , introducing @xmath154 , write the term @xmath178 as @xmath179 times @xmath180 and approximate the latter by @xmath181 .",
    "clearly , as long as @xmath48 is extremely large and @xmath153 is not extremely close to zero or 1 , then this will be an excellent approximation .    combining ( [ pspower ] ) with the definition of @xmath153 before ( [ binomapprox ] ) we see that , if we identify @xmath48 with @xmath182 , then @xmath183 where @xmath184 and that , provided @xmath48 is extremely large and s and b are of ` comparable size ' , which of course , in view of ( [ pcn ] ) , corresponds exactly to @xmath153 not being extremely close to zero or 1 , then , by ( [ binomapprox ] ) , to a high degree of accuracy , we will have the approximation @xmath185 i.e.  a gaussian with a peak located ( see section [ sect : peak ] for an alternative perspective on equation ( [ antipopular ] ) ) at @xmath186 and @xmath187 and there will of course be an obvious counterpart formula for the energy probability density , @xmath188 , of b , similar to the above formula but with @xmath153 replaced by @xmath189 .",
    "( this of course changes the value of @xmath190 but not of @xmath191 . )",
    "so the energy of s will be in a gaussian band around a most likely energy of @xmath190 , the energy of b will be in a gaussian band around a most likely energy of @xmath192 , each having the same width which will be @xmath51 divided by a number ( i.e.  @xmath193 ) which is of the order of the square root of either of the ( comparable ! ) numbers @xmath124 , @xmath78 .",
    "moreover it is easy to see that , in both the traditional microcanonical and the modern total pure state approaches , the two energy probability densities will be perfectly anticorrelated ",

    ", we note that , for general @xmath206 , the width , @xmath195 , of the energy probability density , @xmath156 , of this comparison thermal state is ( as is easily calculated ) @xmath207 ",
    "i.e.  ( to a very good approximation for large @xmath206 ) a factor of @xmath208 wider than the width of @xmath202 while the height is ( again by an easy calculation ) a factor of @xmath208 smaller .",
    "we shall postpone to section [ sect : morentropy ] a calculation of the ( microcanonical and modern ) entropies of s and b for general @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "suffice it to remark that , like the width , @xmath195 , the microcanical entropy of s , differs , in general , from its value in the comparison thermal state at inverse temperature @xmath205 , albeit the difference is just a ` small ' constant ( it is smaller by @xmath211 ) independent of @xmath21 .    finally , we remark that , in this power - law density - of - states case , it is clear from the developments in this section that the ` canonical ' ( i.e.  thermal ) behaviour of @xmath212 ( or indeed of @xmath213 ) in the case that the system , s , is very much smaller than the energy bath , b , may be reconciled with the above - discussed gaussian behaviour , when s and b are of comparable size , in that the relationship between the two may be regarded as an instance of the well - known relationship ( see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite ) between the poisson and gaussian distributions in probability theory .",
    "( this obviously easily follows from the way we derived , above , both the canonical behaviour and the gaussian behaviour as limits of the binomial distribution . )",
    "we now turn to discuss the quite different behaviour of the reduced density operators @xmath41 and @xmath114 when the densities of states of s and b increase exponentially .",

    "it is interesting ( especially in preparation for the discussion in section [ sect : bhimplications ] and in our companion papers @xcite about the connection with quantum black hole physics both of the results in sections [ sect : exp ] and [ sect : expform ] concerning densities of states which grow exponentially with energy and , in section [ sect : expesq ] , concerning those which grow as quadratic exponentials in the energy ) to calculate the mean energy , @xmath226 , and also the von neumman entropy , @xmath8 , for each of the density operators , @xmath41 , @xmath114 ( and also for @xmath222 , @xmath227 ) .",

    "] , we next wish to compare the formulae ( [ enprobdensexpsquared ] ) and ( [ enprobdensexpsquaredapprox ] ) for @xmath71 with @xmath294 where @xmath295 is a suitable constant , which , but for the fact that it is not integrable on the interval @xmath296 ( for any value of @xmath12 ! ) would deserve to be called ` the energy probability density of a thermal state at inverse temperature @xmath12 ' ( cf .",
    "( [ psgibbs ] ) ) for the same density of states ( [ sigmasbexpsquared ] ) .",

    "thus , at low energies  and indeed at all energies , @xmath21 , up to a little below @xmath51  the energy probability density , @xmath71 , is closely approximated by the thermal energy probability density for @xmath310 , while there is a qualitative resemblance between @xmath71 on its full interval @xmath311 $ ] and @xmath299 on the interval @xmath312 $ ] ( with the above - mentioned quantitative discrepancy that the second peak in @xmath71 occurs near @xmath51 while the second peak in @xmath299 occurs near @xmath313 ) .    moreover , one may easily check that , except for discrepancies corresponding to the above discrepancy for the energy probability densities , the reduced density operators , @xmath41 ( defined as in ( [ microreduced ] ) ) and @xmath114 ( defined as in ( [ purereduced ] ) ) , respectively , will stand in relation to @xmath314 ( defined as in ( [ sgibbs ] ) ) for @xmath310 , in a similar way to the relationships which we termed ` @xmath51-approximately thermal ' and ` @xmath51-approximately semi - thermal ' in section [ sect : exp ] .    in conclusion , except for the discrepancy pointed out above , we may say that , in contrast again to the situation for power - law densities of states and with many similarities ( but also a few differences ) to what we found in sections [ sect : exp ] , [ sect : expform ] , for densities of states which grow exponentially with energy , also densities of states which grow , ( [ sigmasbexpsquared ] ) , as quadratic exponentials lead to reduced density operators on s and b which are , in the sense we have explained above , approximately thermal .",
    "next we turn to calculate the von neumann entropies of @xmath41 and @xmath114 when the densities of states are as in ( [ sigmasbexpsquared ] ) .    in the spirit of the last paragraph of section [",
    "sect : expform ] we expect the leading term in @xmath134 to be given by @xmath315 where , for the first approximate equality , we have replaced the logarithm in ( [ contmicroentropy ] ) by its ` main part ' ",
    "i.e.  by the exponent , @xmath316 , in the first equation in ( [ sigmasbexpsquared ] ) , and , for the second approximate equality , we have used the fact that the energy probability density , @xmath317 ( see ( [ enprobdensexpsquaredapprox ] ) and figure [ fig3 ] ) consists of two sharp peaks , each of area @xmath318 , one located at @xmath285 and one at @xmath287 .",
    "proceeding similarly for @xmath136 , we similarly expect the leading term to be given by approximating @xmath319 by @xmath320    it is straightforward to check that the error in both ( [ smicrocexpesq ] ) and ( [ smodernexpesq ] ) is only of order 1 in @xmath51 ; one needs only to be careful to realize that this is one situation in which ( cf .",
    "endnote @xcite ) it is important to work with the discrete sum versions , ( [ microentropy ] ) and ( [ pureentropy ] ) or alternatively ( [ altmicroentropy ] ) and ( [ altpureentropy ] ) , of our entropy formulae ; if one were to work unthinkingly with ( [ contmicroentropy ] ) and ( [ contpureentropy ] ) , one might ( wrongly ) conclude there is a ( for some values of @xmath279 , @xmath7 and @xmath51 , negative ! ) correction to both equations of form @xmath321  the problem being caused by the steeply rising behaviour of @xmath71 near @xmath285 and @xmath287 .",
    "thus , for our densities of states which grow as quadratic exponentials , there is an even more dramatic difference between the value of @xmath134 and the value of @xmath136 than we found , in section [ sect : expform ] , for densities of states which grow exponentially with energy ( where they differed by a factor of 2 ) .",
    "_ note _ : the reader may wish to skip this , and the next , section on a first reading and go directly to section [ sect : bhimplications ] .      in the case of our power - law density of states example",
    ", an alternative way of arguing that the location of the peak of the energy probability density , @xmath71 , of the system , s , is given by the formula ( [ antipopular ] ) is to assume foreknowledge of the existence of a ( single ) peak in the energy probability density , @xmath317 , in the interior of the energy - interval @xmath290 $ ] and then to note that , by ( [ enprobdens ] ) , this must occur at an energy , @xmath21 for which @xmath322 which easily implies ( [ antipopular ] ) .    in a popular approach ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) to such problems involving the microcanonical ensemble of a pair of weakly coupled systems with such a ( say unique , interior ) peak , such a calculation often appears in the following guise :    one writes @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
    "one calls @xmath325 `` @xmath326 '' , and one calls @xmath327 `` @xmath328 '' .",
    "then one writes the equations @xmath329 @xmath330 ( equivalent to ( [ popsigma ] ) and @xmath331 ( expressing the fact that it is a peak and not a trough ) .",
    "it is often then assumed , or , at least , tacitly implied , that @xmath332 and @xmath333 are the `` entropies '' of systems 1 and 2 ( our systems s and ` energy bath ' b ) and that @xmath334 and @xmath335 are the `` temperatures '' of systems 1 and 2 .",
    "finally , the equation ( [ popstable ] ) is interpreted as telling us that systems 1 and 2 are in `` stable equilibrium '' .",
    "concerning this popular approach , we would remark and emphasize :    \\(a ) @xmath332 and @xmath333 ( our @xmath336 and @xmath337 ) are _ not _ entropies ( they are logarithms of densities of states ) . to make sense of the logarithms one would , at least , need to multiply @xmath338 and @xmath339 by `` constants '' with the dimensions of energy , first , to make the overall arguments of the logarithms dimensionless",
    ". this may not matter if the resulting logarithm is anyway destined to be differentiated with respect to @xmath21 to define a ` temperature ' ( see paragraph ( b ) below ) .",
    "however it _ will _ matter if one wishes to talk meaningfully about the logarithms themselves ( evaluated at the peak values of @xmath21 and @xmath194 ) as ` entropies ' .",
    "one could , of course , insert , in each logarithm , an arbitrary constant with the dimensions of energy , and try to argue that it does nt make much difference , in practice , what is the precise value of this constant provided it is of a `` reasonable '' order of magnitude .",
    "but , even if it were the case that all that was at stake was such a `` constant '' , one would expect , in a fundamental understanding of the origin of entropy , its value to be determined in terms of the physical parameters of the problem . in fact , as we shall see below , what actually needs to be inserted is not a constant , but rather ( for given system and energy - bath densities of states ) a quantity ( which we call @xmath340 below ) with the dimensions of energy which ( like the peak values of @xmath21 and @xmath194 themselves ) depends on the totem energy , @xmath51 .",
    "\\(b ) it is true that one can think of @xmath334 and @xmath341 as ` energy - dependent temperatures ' in the sense ( cf .",
    "section [ sect : background ] and endnote @xcite ) that , if system  1 had energy @xmath342 and were uncoupled to system  2 , but , rather , coupled to another and much smaller system , then that smaller system would likely get itself into a thermal state at the temperature @xmath334 evaluated at @xmath342 ( and similarly for system  2 ) .",
    "however , in the ` equilibrium ' in question , where system  1 and system  2 are coupled to one - another and neither can be regarded as ` small ' , _ neither _ system  1 nor system  2 is in a thermal state ( as we have shown in section [ sect : power ] for our power - law case ) !",
    "\\(c ) finally , this ` popular ' point of view is only of value in cases where the energy probability density ( say of system 1 ) has a peak . whereas , we emphasize , as explained in this paper , one still predicts definite energy probability density functions when system  1 and system  2 have densities of states ( such as our equal exponential and equal quadratic exponential cases discussed in sections [ sect : exp ] and [ sect : expesq ] ) which do not lead to an interior peak .",
    "( in the equal exponential case , we find an energy probability density which is flat , and , in the quadratic exponential case , it is concave with peaks at the extremities of the range @xmath311 $ ] which are not ` maxima ' in the sense of the above equations for @xmath343 and @xmath344 . ) in such latter cases , the significant quantity of interest is not the location of a peak ( there may even be no peak ) but rather the full energy probability density function itself .",
    "we turn next to the value of the entropy of the system in cases where , for given system and energy - bath densities of states , and given total energy , @xmath51 , the energy probability density , @xmath71 , has a single peak , say at @xmath345 .",
    "we are , of course , interested in both of the entropies , @xmath134 and @xmath136 .",
    "as we anticipated in point ( a ) above , when the totem is in the microcanonical ensemble with energy in our interval @xmath33 $ ] , @xmath134 will be @xmath346 for a suitable quantity , @xmath340 , with the dimensions of energy determined by the parameters of the problem , although we emphasize again that @xmath340 is not a `` constant '' ; rather ( for given system and energy - bath densities of states ) it is a certain function of totem energy , @xmath51 , which has the dimensions of energy and which is determined by the detailed shape of the peak in @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , by the general formula ( [ contmicroentropy ] ) ( one can see that the issues mentioned in endnote @xcite will not be relevant for a sharp peak which is well inside the interior of the interval @xmath311 $ ] ) we will have @xmath347 where we have _ temporarily _ introduced an arbitrary non - zero constant , @xmath348 , with the dimensions of energy , which will of course cancel out in the final result .",
    "since @xmath71 is , by assumption , sharply peaked at @xmath345 , and assuming @xmath19 is relatively slowly varying ( as will be true in typical examples such as the power - law density of states case treated below ) the value of the first integral will be very well approximated by @xmath349 .",
    "the second integral will obviously take the form @xmath350 where @xmath340 is a quantity with the dimensions of energy which can in principle be computed in terms of our system and energy - bath densities of states and the value of @xmath51 .",
    "so we will have @xmath351 on the other hand , if we consider the totem to be in a pure state , randomly chosen amongst all states with energy in the range @xmath33 $ ] , then , by ( [ contpureentropy ] ) , we expect the entropy to most probably be very close to @xmath136 given by @xmath352 which , by a similar argument , and in view of the definition of @xmath108 ( see after equation ( [ purereduced ] ) ) , will be very well approximated by @xmath353 for the same value of @xmath340 .",
    "we next illustrate the computation of @xmath340 in the case where both of system , s , and energy bath , b , have the power law densities of states ( [ sigmasbpower ] ) which we discussed in section [ sect : power ] .",
    "we have @xmath354 where @xmath71 is given by ( [ pspowerapprox ] ) with @xmath191 as in ( [ gamma ] ) . as long as",
    "@xmath124 and @xmath78 are comparable in size , the location , ( [ antipopular ] ) , of the peak , @xmath190 , will be far from the extremities of the interval @xmath290 $ ] and we may clearly replace the limits of the above integral by @xmath289 and @xmath288 with very little error .",
    "so @xmath355 @xmath356 the second term above may easily be calculated by writing it as@xmath357 .",
    "this is equal to @xmath358 .",
    "so @xmath359 or , equivalently , @xmath360    for the purposes of the comparison we make in section [ sect : power ] , we also calculate @xmath340 for a _ thermal _ state at some given inverse temperature , @xmath12 , of a system , s , with a power law density of states @xmath203 . by ( [ probdenspowergibbs ] )",
    "we will now have @xmath361 @xmath362 we may do the integral here by noticing that @xmath363 @xmath364 @xmath365 @xmath366 @xmath367 where @xmath368 denotes the gamma function and @xmath369 the digamma function ( see e.g.  @xcite ) of @xmath370 which ( see again @xcite ) is equal to @xmath371 where @xmath295 is euler s constant ( @xmath372 ) . using this , we conclude that @xmath373 @xmath374 which , using stirling s approximation ( which tells us that @xmath375 and the asymptotic expansion of @xmath369 ( @xmath376 ) is equal to @xmath377 from which we conclude that @xmath378 we note that if we identify @xmath206 here with @xmath209 and if @xmath379 , then , by ( [ gamma ] ) , @xmath380 . if , additionally , we take @xmath12 in ( [ qpowerthermal ] ) to be @xmath381 which ( with @xmath382 ) equals @xmath383 , then the @xmath340 of ( [ qpowerpower ] ) and ( [ qpowerthermal ] ) both take the same value @xmath384 .",
    "this agreement is to be expected since , as we discussed in sections [ sect : intro ] and [ sect : power ] , in this situation , where s is small and in the case of a total microcanonical state , the reduced density operator of s will be close to that of a thermal state at inverse temperature @xmath381 .",
    "so the agreement of the two @xmath340 in this regime serves as a check on the correctness of our two formulae ( [ qpowerpower ] ) and ( [ qpowerthermal ] ) .",
    "however , in section [ sect : power ] we were interested in comparing the properties of the ( as we show there ) _ non - thermal _ reduced state of s when @xmath209 and @xmath210 are of comparable size and the totem is in a microcanonical state with the properties of a thermal state of s with the same expected energy .",
    "treating , for simplicity , the case where @xmath385 , say , the relevant inverse temperature , @xmath12 , is @xmath386 ( @xmath387 for large @xmath206 ) and @xmath191 ( [ gamma ] ) is @xmath200 .",
    "we then find that the ` thermal ' @xmath340 ( equation ( [ qpowerthermal ] ) ) becomes @xmath388 whereas the ` microcanonical ' @xmath340 ( equation ( [ qpowerpower ] ) ) becomes @xmath389 .",
    "thus the entropy of the comparison thermal state of s is bigger than the entropy , @xmath134 , of the reduced state of s by @xmath390 . while this is a small difference it is conceptually significant that it is not zero .",
    "our general framework involves a system , s , and an energy bath , b , comprising a totem .",
    "a natural question is : what is the relationship between the entropy of s , the entropy of b , and the entropy of the totem ?",
    "the answer to this question depends , first of all , on whether we are contemplating the , traditional , microcanonical , scenario , or the modern scenario in which the state of the totem is pure  albeit chosen at random amongst the set of states in our energy range . in the latter , modern , scenario , there is only one entropy : as we mentioned in sections [ sect : entropy ] and [ sect : gen ] , the ( von neumann ) entropy of s is equal to the ( von neumann ) entropy of b and both are equal to the @xmath127system@xmath128-@xmath127energy bath@xmath128 entanglement entropy of the totem ; the von neumann entropy of the totem is of course zero .    in the microcanonical scenario ,",
    "one might , naively , expect the entropy of the totem to be the sum of the entropy of s and the entropy of b. but , as we shall see , this is not true .",
    "one way to see that it can not be true is to notice ( see again below ) that the entropy of the totem ( which will obviously have the value @xmath391 , @xmath34 as in ( [ micro ] ) and ( [ sumnorm ] ) )  below we shall call this @xmath392  depends on the width , @xmath35 , of our energy band @xmath33 $ ] whereas , as we saw in section [ sect : gen ] ( for a suitable range of @xmath35 ) the entropies of s and b do not . what is of course always true ( and applies to both modern and microcanonical scenarios ) is the property of _ subadditivity _ @xcite which guarantees that the the entropy of the totem , must be less than or equal to the sum of the entropies of s and b.    actually , it turns out , in all three cases we have studied here ( i.e.  with system and energy bath densities of states of power - law form and [ equal ] exponential or quadratic exponential form ) that the sum of the entropies of s and b is _ close to _ the entropy of the totem . we have not attempted to formulate any general precise statement of what we mean by this , nor have we attempted to offer any general explanation as to why this should be the case but content ourselves simply with making the content of this statement manifest for each of our three density - of - states models :    for our ( equal ) exponential densities of states ( [ sigmasbexponential ] ) we notice that , by ( [ mexp ] ) @xmath393 whereas , by ( [ smicroexp ] ) @xmath394    for our ( equal ) quadratic exponential densities of states ( [ sigmasbexpsquared ] ) , by ( [ mexpenergysquared ] ) @xmath395 whereas ( see ( [ smicrocexpesq ] ) and the paragraph after ( [ smodernexpesq ] ) ) @xmath396    for our power - law densities of states ( [ sigmasbpower ] )",
    ", we first obtain a good approximate formula for @xmath34 by noting that the value of the integral in ( [ mpowerintegral ] ) is equal to the ratio of the maximum value of its integrand , @xmath397 ( @xmath190 as in ( [ antipopular ] ) ) to its maximum value when normalized , which , by our gaussian approximation , ( [ pspowerapprox ] ) , is well - approximated by @xmath398 , @xmath191 as in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "thus we have ( to a very good approximation ) @xmath399 whereas , by ( [ smicrocpower ] ) for s and its obvious counterpart for b and ( [ qpowerpower ] ) , @xmath400    we see that subadditivity in the exponential case entails @xmath401 . in the quadratic exponential case , ( and neglecting the @xmath402 term ) it entails @xmath403 , and in the power - law case , it entails @xmath404 . when @xmath385 , say , @xmath405 and this latter inequality amounts to @xmath406 .",
    "the first of these inequalities ( @xmath401 ) is obviously consistent with almost any sort of smallness assumption on @xmath35 .",
    "the other two inequalities indicate a need to be more precise than we were , in our rather sketchy remarks in section [ sect : intro ] and in our subsequent derivations , about what is the appropriate range of @xmath35 for any given pair of densities of states , @xmath407 and @xmath408 , in order for our arguments and approximations to be valid .",
    "we shall , however , not pursue this issue further in the present paper except to deduce that the above inequalities must be necessary conditions on the value of @xmath35 .",
    "throughout the preceding sections we have assumed ( see the paragraph after equation ( [ coupling ] ) ) that both our system , s , and our energy bath , b , have densities of states which are positively supported ( i.e.  the hamiltonians @xmath23 and @xmath25 are positive ) and monotonically increasing and we have been concerned exclusively with totem states which are ( close to ) stationary states for a totem hamiltonian , ( [ coupling ] ) , which weakly couples s and b. in this short section , we point out that the prospects for the thermality of either s or b become much less constrained if we relax some of these assumptions . in particular , and in the spirit of the ` modern ' approach , given _ any _ system density of states , @xmath0 , whatsoever ( provided only it grows sufficiently slowly for the desired thermal state to exist ) one can always find an energy bath density of states and a pure totem state such that the reduced state of the system is an exactly thermal state at any given temperature .    in fact",
    ", there is a well - known procedure , in the spirit of the modern approach , known as ` purification ' ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ; see also the papers on ` thermofield dynamics ' @xcite and @xcite which are based on the same idea  we note that the term ` purification ' seems to be due to powers and st@xmath409rmer @xcite ) by which a system , s , with any density of states whatsoever ( but we shall assume it to be positively supported and monotonically increasing ) and in any non - pure state one wishes to prescribe ( but we are interested in a thermal state at some inverse temperature @xmath12 ) may be provided with a notional energy bath , b , such that there is a choice of pure state on the resulting totem for which the reduced density operator on s is equal to the the prescribed state .    the essential idea of purification",
    "is based on the fact that any density operator , @xmath118 , on a hilbert space , @xmath32 , takes the form @xmath410 the @xmath411 being positive numbers which sum to 1 and @xmath412 being an orthonormal basis for @xmath32 , and on the observation that this can be viewed as arising as the partial trace over the second copy of @xmath32 , in the tensor product @xmath413 , of the pure density operator , @xmath84 , where @xmath414 the easiest way to see this is to notice that , for any linear operator , @xmath415 , on @xmath32 , @xmath416 if we now specialize to the thermal situation where the @xmath417 are the energy eigenstates of a hamiltonian , @xmath11 , on @xmath32 with energy eigenvalues say @xmath418 and @xmath419 and identify @xmath32 both with the system hilbert space , @xmath24 , and also with the hilbert space , @xmath26 , of our notional energy bath , then , if we also take the energy bath hamiltonian to equal @xmath11 ( and therefore the energy levels of the energy bath to be the same as the energy levels of the system ) then @xmath85 provides us with a pure totem state with the property that the reduced state of the system ( and also the reduced state of the energy bath ) is exactly thermal . with the notation of section [ sect : background ] , we would write @xmath420 and take @xmath85 on @xmath421 to be given by latexmath:[\\[\\label{pure } \\psi = z_{s,\\beta}^{-1/2 } \\sum_{\\epsilon=\\delta}^\\infty e^{-\\beta\\epsilon/2 } \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\epsilon ) }    of @xmath84 over @xmath24 will equal the @xmath81 of equation ( [ sgibbs ] ) .",
    "this achievement of exact thermality contrasts with the situation discussed in section [ sect : ans ] ( see in and after the paragraph containing equation ( [ psgibbs ] ) ) where ( on the ` modern approach ' ) the totem state is assumed to be randomly chosen from amongst totem states in a narrow range of energies for a weakly coupled total hamiltonian .",
    "as we saw there and in the rest of part 1 , with that assumption , and for systems of comparable size , thermality can never be achieved exactly and can only be approximately achieved for certain special densities of states  such as , in particular , the exponential and quadratic exponential cases discussed in sections [ sect : exp ] and [ sect : expesq ] .",
    "however , in the purification mechanism described here , the state , @xmath85 , of the totem is ",
    "say if we regard the totem hamiltonian to be given by equation ( [ coupling ] ) with @xmath423 ( and , say , with no coupling term at all )  clearly not even close to an energy eigenstate ; in other words , the totem is in a highly non - stationary state .",
    "we remark that this purification mechanism does not seem to play much of a role in everyday physics as a mechanism by which a system can get to be hot , although , interestingly , essentially this mechanism has been made use of in the laboratory @xcite to produce thermal states of photons .",
    "( see also the remark about the unruh effect in the next paragraph and the remarks about quantum black holes in section [ sect : bhimplications ] . )",
    "we further remark that there is an alternative reinterpretation of equation ( [ pure ] ) in which one ascribes to the ` energy bath ' , b , the hamiltonian @xmath424 ( and substitutes these hamiltonians into the totem hamiltonain formula ( [ coupling ] ) ) . with this interpretation ,",
    "the state of the totem is an eigenstate of totem energy ( with totem energy eigenvalue zero ! ) and so a stationary state .",
    "but now the density of states of the energy bath is negatively supported !",
    "this latter interpretation can be said to be realized in the unruh effect ( see e.g.  @xcite and reference therein ) whereby the vacuum state of a relativistic quantum field theory in minkowski space , restricted to a right - rindler wedge , is a thermal state with respect to lorentz boosts ; the left - rindler wedge plays the role of our energy bath , b , and this can be thought of as a copy of the right - wedge quantum system but with a hamiltonian which is the negative of the right - wedge rindler hamiltonian .",
    "there is a striking , at least superficial , resemblance between equations ( [ betaequals2qe ] ) and ( [ smicrocexpesq ] ) in section [ sect : expesq ]  i.e.  @xmath310 and @xmath425 ( up to an @xmath402 correction )  for the inverse temperature and the traditional microcanonical entropy of a weakly coupled system , s , and energy bath , b , with equal quadratic exponential densities of states ( [ sigmasbexpsquared ] ) and the equations ( see section [ sect : blackholes ] ) @xmath426 and @xmath427 for the hawking inverse temperature and entropy of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "in fact , if we identify , say ( see below ) , the mean energy of b ",
    "i.e.  ( see ( [ expesqenergy ] ) ) half the totem mean energy , @xmath140  with the black hole mass , @xmath98 , and identify @xmath7 with @xmath428 , the entropy , @xmath429 matches the hawking entropy and the ( inverse ) temperatures match too .",
    "this might seem to suggest that , if one identifies the system , s , with ` matter ' and the energy bath , b , with ` gravity ' , then the traditional microcanonical strand of section [ sect : expesq ] may provide a good model for a black hole in contact with its thermal atmosphere in a box and a good explanation for the microscopic origin of the entropy of this system .",
    "( of course , we must bear in mind that , in this model , the state is only thermal in the approximate sense explained in section [ sect : expesq ] . ) and on the other hand , our result , ( [ smodernexpesq ] ) , that , with the densities of states ( [ sigmasbexpsquared ] ) , the ` modern ' totem pure state entropy , @xmath136 vanishes ( up to a term of order 1 in @xmath51 ) might seem to be at odds with our matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis described in @xcite and in section [ sect : blackholes ]  which entails that the total matter - gravity state of a black hole is a pure state .",
    "however , we need to realize that the results of section [ sect : expesq ] assume that the dynamics of the totem is governed by a totem hamiltonian of the schematic form ( [ coupling ] ) with both s and b ( now to be interpreted as ` matter ' and ` gravity ' ) hamiltonians positive and weakly coupled . yet , notoriously , it seems unlikely to be possible to have a quantum theory of gravity within the scope of these basic assumptions ( albeit these assumptions do seem to apply to the weak - string coupling limit if the fundamental degrees of freedom are taken to be those of a string rather than of the gravitational field itself  see section [ sect : betterstring ] ) .",
    "already classical general relativity is nonlinear and , unlike the situation for ( [ coupling ] ) , energy ( mass ) is not additive .",
    "so the fact that the mean energies of system and energy bath ( modelling matter and gravity ) are equal in our model seems strange .",
    "( it is also unclear whether we should identify the entropy of the black hole with @xmath429 as we did above , or with @xmath430 , which is twice as big , or with @xmath391  see also section [ totement ] . )",
    "furthermore ( see the remarks after equation ( [ expesqenergy ] ) ) in this model , the mean energy , @xmath140 , of each of matter and of gravity is anyway just the mean of an energy probability density ( the @xmath317 of ( [ enprobdensexpsquaredapproxbeta ] ) and of figure [ fig3 ] ) which is peaked at the extremes , @xmath285 and @xmath287 , while of course ( cf .  after equation ( [ expesqenergy ] ) ) the energy probability densities of matter and gravity are perfectly anticorrelated .",
    "so the model predicts large statistical fluctuations , with ( to the extent that it makes sense to talk about the energy of subsystems in general relativity ) probability distributions for matter and gravity being such that , approximately , with probability one half , gravity has all the energy and matter none , and with probability one half , matter has all the energy and gravity none . the latter case ( where there is presumably no black hole ) is then a particular problem because ( see the next paragraph ) presumably the quadratic exponential form of the density of states presupposed in the model for matter becomes invalid when a black hole is not present .    in fact ,",
    "turning to more specifically quantum aspects , aside from all the usual problems of quantum gravity ( non - renormalizability etc . )",
    "it would seem to be incorrect to assume that one can ascribe a single density of states to each of gravity and matter throughout changes of state which include the formation of black holes .",
    "rather it would seem that one has to assign , in some sense , a ` state - dependent density of states ' to matter ; in the absence of black holes , the densities of states of common forms of matter ( including photons ) grow much more slowly than quadratic exponentials , while , plausibly , when a black hole is present , they do grow as quadratic exponentials ( with subleading corrections ) .",
    "( evidence for this latter statement is provided by the ` brick wall ' approach @xcite which suggests that the matter entropy is comparable to the gravitational entropy when a black hole is present .",
    "we shall also argue in @xcite that the string scenario we advocate in section [ sect : betterstring ] and discuss further in @xcite leads , plausibly , to just such a state - dependent density of states for matter . ) moreover , the situation is further complicated by the very different status of the concept of ` time ' in general relativity from that presupposed in traditional formulations of quantum theory .    in the light of all these problems and difficulties , and of our current lack of knowledge as to how to resolve them ( other than to assume that a black hole is an [ ill - understood ] strong string - coupling limit of a certain [ better understood ] state of string theory at weak coupling  see section [ sect : betterstring ] )",
    "it seems to us still reasonable to cling to our matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis and our entanglement picture of black hole equilibrium ( see section [ sect : blackholes ] ) .",
    "indeed , there would seem just as much reason to believe in a model along the following ` modern ' lines ( inspired by the idea of ` purification ' outlined in section [ sect : moretherm ] ) as to believe in the above model within the traditional microcanonical strand of section [ sect : expesq ] :    _ a tentative possible ` modern ' model with the correct hawking value for the entropy : _ ` matter ' is modelled as a ` system ' , ` s ' , and gravity as an ` energy bath ' , ` b ' , which each have a density of states as in ( [ sigmasbexpsquared ] ) , and the total state of the matter - gravity totem which corresponds to a black hole of mass @xmath431 is modelled by the pure density operator @xmath84 where @xmath85 is @xmath432 ) , ( [ degdensb ] ) and ( [ sigmasbexpsquared ] ) ) @xmath433 and @xmath434 .",
    "this state is easily seen to have partial traces over s and b identical to those , i.e.  the @xmath222 and @xmath41 of ( [ microreduced ] ) , of the microcanonical state ( [ microsysbath ] ) @xmath42 for the same densities of states ( i.e.  ( [ sigmasbexpsquared ] ) ) and thus , obviously , it will equally well predict an inverse temperature of @xmath435 and a system entropy ( @xmath129 energy bath entropy ) of @xmath436 ( plus the same @xmath402 correction ) .    while we have argued that this latter ` modern ' model is no less justified than our above microcanonical model , in view of the difficulties and problems mentioned above , it is still quite unclear what status should be assigned to it or how seriously it should be taken .",
    "there is also an apparent flaw in this tentative model in that the pure state of the totem is far from being an energy - eigenstate .",
    "it could possibly be that this is the best one can do when one attempts to force a strong - coupling situation into a weak - coupling mould , or maybe the model should be modified along the lines of the alternative reinterpretation of equation ( [ pure ] ) in section [ sect : moretherm ] so that the totem state is modelled as an energy eigenstate , at the expense of having densities of states which are not monotonically increasing and/or not positively supported .",
    "finally , there is the same strange feature that we raised above for our microcanonical model , that both the gravity and the matter are modelled as having , on average , exactly half of the mass ( i.e.  @xmath140 ) of the totem .",
    "also , as in the microcanonical model , the energy probability densities of matter and gravity are predicted to each have the same energy probability density ( the @xmath317 of ( [ enprobdensexpsquaredapproxbeta ] ) and of figure [ fig3 ] ) with equal - sized peaks at @xmath285 and @xmath287 .",
    "albeit , interestingly ( and related to the fact that the totem state is far from being an energy eigenstate ) this model differs from the microcanonical model in that the two energy probability densities are now no longer anticorrelated but , instead , perfectly correlated : one sees immediately from ( [ modernbhmodel ] ) that when gravity has energy near 0 , so will matter , and when gravity has energy near @xmath51 , so will matter .",
    "so at least one of the problems we mentioned above ( the one we referred to as a `` particular problem '' ) for the microcanoncial model seems to be alleviated in the above proposed ` modern ' model .",
    "another problem which is alleviated with this tentative modern model is that it is clear , in this modern model that the entropy should be identified with @xmath437 , whereas , as we remarked above , in the microcanonical model it was not clear whether it should be identified with @xmath429 or with ( approximately  see section [ totement ] ) twice this value ; in the modern model , there _ is _ only one entropy ",
    "i.e.  the s - b entanglement entropy ( @xmath438 ) !    one would also wish to be able to relate our discussion , in section [ sect : peak ] , of cases where the probability density is sharply peaked , to the results , @xcite , of hawking on his microcanonical approach to quantum black holes",
    ". these latter results of hawking do seem to form a physically compelling and coherent picture and one would like to understand whether and , if so , how , they can be reconciled with the modern strand of results in section [ sect : peak ] even though they seem , superficially , to be more easy to understand in terms of the microcanonical strand of work there and seem , superficially , to be at odds with the modern strand . we hope to address this question elsewhere .",
    "suffice it to to say here that , again , the difficulties and problems mentioned above are of at least equal relevance also to this issue and thus it seems difficult , also for this issue , to reach a fully convincing conclusion either way @xcite .",
    "where we have been able to make a , we think , persuasive , case for the relevance , of the ` modern ' strand of ideas in the present paper  used in combination with the ( see section [ sect : blackholes ] ) matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis of @xcite  to the understanding of black hole entropy is with a model which relates the work in sections [ sect : exp ] and [ sect : expform ] here , concerning densities of states which grow exponentially with energy , to an understanding of black hole entropy based on the idea that black holes are strong string - coupling limits of states of weakly coupled string theory .",
    "this application of our work to quantum black holes seems to be more well - founded because , unlike in the situations discussed above , we _ would _ expect the general assumptions we made at the outset here ( positive hamiltonians , weak coupling etc . )  to be applicable to the weak - coupling regime of string theory .    in 1993 , susskind @xcite proposed , and in 1997 , horowitz and polchinski @xcite , gave further evidence , of a semi - qualitative nature , for , the hypothesis that a ( say 4-dimensional , schwarzschild ) black hole can be interpreted as the strong string - coupling limit of a certain state of string theory at weak coupling consisting of a ( single ) long string .",
    "these authors argued that one obtains , with this interpretation , an explanation of black hole entropy in terms of known formulae , based on the ` counting of states ' , in string theory at low string coupling .",
    "moreover , in related work on extremal , and near extremal , black holes ( an important early paper was strominger and vafa @xcite ) , full quantitative agreement was found between the results of such a string theory approach to black hole entropy ( and other related quantities ) and the previously established hawking formulae .",
    "it was then claimed that this work , not only gave a microscopic explanation for black hole entropy but also , in view of the fact that string theory is a standard quantum mechanical theory with a unitary time evolution , that it resolved the information loss puzzle ( see section [ sect : blackholes ] ) .",
    "we next wish to argue that , while we agree all this work seems to provide us with an important clue towards the microscopic understanding of black - hole entropy which , plausibly , may well turn out to be consistent with a resolution to the information loss puzzle , it can not , by itself , be regarded as a complete explanation of these things .",
    "( we shall expand on these arguments in two companion papers , @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "our point is simply that , what is actually calculated in the cited work ( for example in @xcite ) is not the _ entropy _ of a particular black hole state , but rather the ( logarithm of the ) _ degeneracy _ of a given black hole energy level .",
    "no explanation was given in the cited work as to why the logarithm of this degeneracy should be interpreted physically as an entropy .",
    "after all the @xmath48th energy level of the textbook non - relativistic hydrogen - atom hamiltonian has a degeneracy of @xmath439 but we would not predict from this that a hydrogen atom has an entropy of @xmath440 ! of course it is true that the logarithm of the degeneracy of an energy level is the same thing as the von neumann entropy of the microcanonical density operator @xmath441 where we denote by @xmath442 , ( @xmath443 ) the elements of a basis of states with the given energy .",
    "but if we were to attempt to interpret e.g.  the strominger vafa results as meaning that a black hole should be modelled by such an ( impure ! ) microcanoncial state , then the information loss puzzle would surely return : how , in a string theoretic description of a dynamical process of black hole formation , can a presumably pure initial string theory state evolve into such an ( impure ) microcanonical state ?",
    "( such a microcanonical state also would nt fit with our picture of black holes as thermal states . )",
    "actually , the horowitz - polchinski work is couched in terms , not of the degeneracy of a particular energy level of string theory , but rather of the ( averaged out ) density of states of a long string .",
    "the problem is then compounded by the fact that a density of states is not a dimensionless quantity , so it is not physically meaningful to take its logarithm @xcite .",
    "( in fact similar remarks apply to those we make in paragraph ( a ) of section [ sect : peak ] . )",
    "focusing on this horowitz - polchinski work , we shall next propose a modified version of their scenario , based on the modern strand of sections [ sect : exp ] and [ sect : expform ] of the present paper , which seems to overcome the above difficulties and to offer the promise of a fully satisfactory explanation of black hole entropy in terms of string theory , consistent with unitarity and consistent with a resolution to the information loss puzzle  namely with the resolution to the information loss puzzle we proposed in @xcite based on our matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis ( see above and section [ sect : blackholes ] ) .",
    "this will be further discussed in @xcite and further developed in @xcite , whose content we indicate very briefly at the end of this subsection .",
    "we begin by briefly recalling the basic argument of susskind , horowitz and polchinski @xcite as expounded in @xcite .",
    "their basic hypothesis is that , as one scales the string length scale , @xmath444 , up and the string coupling constant , @xmath445 , down from their physical values , keeping newton s gravitational constant , @xmath446 , fixed , a ( 4-dimensional ) schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath447 will turn into a long string with roughly the same energy , @xmath448 .",
    "the density of states of such a long string , in the limit of weak coupling , is known , very roughly ( i.e.  omitting an approximately inverse - power prefactor  see below ) to take the exponential form @xmath449 ( @xmath450 a constant with the dimensions of inverse energy of the same order of magnitude as @xmath444 ) .",
    "the gist of the argument is that the ` logarithm ' of this is approximately given by @xmath451 and they refer to this quantity as ( approximately ) the ` entropy of the long string at energy @xmath21 ' .",
    "they then argue that this should be equated with the entropy of a ( schwarzschild ) black hole provided that one does the equating ( i.e.  during the process of scaling @xmath444 described above ) when , to within an order of magnitude or so , @xmath452 which is roughly the ` size ' of the black - hole .",
    "the fact that the schwarzschild radius is @xmath453 . )    combining ( [ horo1 ] ) and ( [ horo2 ] ) ( and replacing @xmath21 by @xmath447 ) they thus claim to predict that the entropy of the black hole will be within an order of magnitude or so of a constant times @xmath454 which agrees , up to an undetermined value for the constant , with the hawking value , @xmath104 , for the entropy of a black hole .    in our view",
    ", what one is actually entitled to say , instead , is that , the number of energy eigenstates of a black hole in a band of width @xmath35 around energy @xmath21 will , by ( [ longstringapproxdens ] ) be @xmath455 , which , for a ` reasonable - sized ' @xmath35 will be approximately the same as @xmath456 . the argument in the previous two paragraphs then tells us that the number of energy eigenstates of a black hole in a band of width @xmath35 around energy ( i.e.  mass ) @xmath98 will be within an undetermined constant , say @xmath295 , of the order of 1 , times @xmath454 ( and thus , by the way , that the density of states of a schwarzschild black hole should behave roughly as a constant times @xmath457 . )",
    "however , in our view , it remains a challenge to explain why the logarithm of this formula for the density of states of a black hole should equal ( to within an unknown constant , @xmath295 of the order of 1 ) the hawking formula for black hole entropy .    in our attempt to meet this challenge , we first posit that the scenario in which a black hole goes over to a single long string should be replaced by a scenario in which an equilibrium state ( i.e.  energy eigenstate ) consisting of a black hole in contact with its matter atmosphere in a suitable box ( on our view described by a pure total state  see our ` entanglement picture of black hole equilibrium ' in section [ sect : blackholes ] ) with approximate total energy , @xmath51 , goes over ( again , as one scales the string length scale , @xmath444 , up and the string coupling constant , @xmath445 , down from their physical values , keeping newton s gravitational constant , @xmath446 fixed ) to a ( pure ) equilibrium state , with a similar total energy , consisting of a single long string in contact with an atmosphere of small strings in a suitably rescaled box .",
    "we now assume that the density of states of the long string takes ( to the same rough approximation as above ) the form of ( [ longstringapproxdens ] ) and that the density of states of the stringy atmosphere , @xmath458 , takes ( again , to a rough approximation ) the similar , exponential , form @xmath459    if we now regard ( most of ) the stringy atmosphere as corresponding to ` matter ' and as playing the role of our ` system ' , s , and the long string as corresponding to ( most of ) ` gravity ' and as playing the role of our energy - bath , ` b ' , then it is plausible that these may be described by hilbert spaces and hamiltonians which , since we are at weak string coupling , should fall within the scope of the present paper , and in particular the dynamics should be described by a totem hamiltonian of form ( [ coupling ] ) . in view of the exponential growth of the densities of states , ( [ longstringapproxdens ] ) and ( [ stringatmosapproxdens ] )",
    ", we may therefore apply the formalism of sections [ sect : exp ] and [ sect : expform ] ( modified as explained in endnote @xcite to take into account the different prefactors , @xmath460 and @xmath450 ) .",
    "in particular , the modern strand of these sections tells us that a typical pure equilibrium state of our @xmath127string atmosphere@xmath128-@xmath127long string@xmath128 totem with energy around @xmath51 will , with a high probability , have an entropy very close to that given by equation ( [ spureexp ] ) with @xmath461 ( with the modification to the logarithmic term given in endnote @xcite ) .",
    "i.e.  ignoring the logarithmic term , by @xmath462 while the ( expected ) energy of the long string , @xmath463 will ( see again endnote @xcite ) be given by @xmath464 ( and , of course the mean energy of the stringy atmosphere will also be @xmath140 in this model ) .    in parallel to the philosophy of @xcite , we now assume that , when we scale @xmath445 back up and @xmath444 down , keeping @xmath446 constant and keeping @xmath85 the ` same ' , we can equate @xmath463 with the mass , @xmath98 , of the black hole when @xmath465 , say , where @xmath466 is an adjustable parameter of the order of 1 . we thereby obtain the prediction @xmath467 , as the value for the entanglement entropy of black hole and thermal atmosphere in the ` same ' ( i.e.  after rescaling ) state @xmath85 .",
    "but it is also plausible ( as indicated above ",
    "see the relevant endnote in @xcite for further discussion ) that this is approximately the same as the entanglement entropy between gravity and matter which , according to the matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis of @xcite and section [ sect : blackholes ] is the physical entropy of the black hole .",
    "we thus predict that the physical entropy of our black hole is ( approximately ) @xmath468 .",
    "this agrees with the hawking entropy of @xmath469 if we take @xmath470 .",
    "furthermore , we showed , in section [ sect : exp ] , that both s and b will be ` @xmath51-approximately semi - thermal ' , in the sense explained there , at inverse temperature @xmath471 . equating this with the inverse black hole temperature when @xmath465 predicts a black hole inverse temperature of @xmath472 which",
    ", intriguingly , agrees with the inverse hawking temperature for the same value of @xmath466 ( i.e.  @xmath473 ) .",
    "we remark that we would not have correctly predicted both hawking temperature and hawking entropy for a single value of @xmath466 had we followed the traditional microcanonical , instead of the modern strand , of section [ sect : exp ] nor if we had adopted the approach of @xcite and defined the inverse temperature by @xmath474 .",
    "( in each case , the necessary values of @xmath466 for fitting the hawking entropy and the hawking temperature would have differed by a factor of 2 . )",
    "however we caution that it is not clear whether this nice feature of our modern model with exponential densities of states survives when ( see next paragraph ) we improve the model to include the appropriate approximately inverse - power prefactors .",
    "we discuss this further in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our main point is that a ` modern ' model for black hole entropy , based on our matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis seems able to predict a temperature of the order of the hawking temperature and an entropy of the order of the hawking entropy .",
    "the main deficiency in the above scenario is the adoption of the equations ( [ longstringapproxdens ] ) and ( [ stringatmosapproxdens ] ) for the approximate forms of the long - string and stringy - atmosphere densities of states .",
    "these formulae omit important ( dimension - dependent ) approximately inverse - power prefactors , and when one takes these into proper account , it turns out ( with some , seemingly reasonable , assumptions ) that the account of the origin of black hole entropy above and in @xcite needs significant changes and is even , in certain respects , misleading , although one arrives at similar final conclusions . the prefactors are also needed to explain why an equilibrium weakly coupled string state in a box consists of a single long string surrounded by an atmosphere of short strings as we posited above .",
    "also , the statistical spread in energy of the string ( and hence the predicted statistical spread in energy of the black hole ) around the mean energy @xmath140 will be altered with the correct prefactors .",
    "all these matters will be discussed in our second companion paper @xcite .",
    "in section [ sect : intro ] , we mentioned the work of lubkin , @xcite , where it is shown that a randomly chosen pure density operator , @xmath88 , on the tensor - product hilbert space , @xmath89 , of a pair of quantum systems ",
    "@xmath90 being @xmath91-dimensional and @xmath92 being @xmath48-dimensional  will , for fixed @xmath91 and @xmath93 , have , with high probability , a reduced density operator , @xmath94 , on @xmath90 , which is close to the maximally mixed density operator  with components , in any hilbert space basis , @xmath95 .",

    "lubkin justified the above statement and made it precise by obtaining a result which is ( easily seen to be ) equivalent to the following exact formula for the mean value ( i.e.  over haar measure on the set of unit vectors @xmath85 ) @xmath475 , of @xmath476 : in our notation @xmath477 we shall re - derive this result of lubkin with a somewhat different method in the next section ( section [ sect : haar ] ) since our full explanatioin of the formula in equation ( [ purereduced ] ) and our arguments for the validity of our proposition of section [ sect : ans ] will be closely based on it .",
    "lubkin then gave a simple general argument which amounts to the statement that , for any density operator , @xmath478 , on an @xmath91-dimensional hilbert space , whenever @xmath479 , then the mean value , @xmath480 , of the von neumann entropy , @xmath481 , of @xmath478 will be well - approximated by @xmath482 applying this result to @xmath94 , ( [ lubkinmeanrhosquared ] ) implies that whenever @xmath483 , @xmath484 which may also be regarded as an alternative quantitative expression of the qualitative property that , when @xmath485 , most @xmath94 must be close to maximally mixed .    in ( [ lubkingeneralentropy ] ) and ( [ lubkinmeanentropy ] ) above",
    ", the von neumann entropy is defined in the usual way as in equation ( [ svn ] ) .    around",
    "15 years later , page @xcite showed that the formula @xmath486 is a good approximation ( with error term of order @xmath487 ) whenever @xmath488 , and noted that this agrees with ( [ lubkinmeanentropy ] ) on their common domain of validity @xcite .",
    "we note here , in passing that , combining the two estimates ( [ lubkinmeanentropy ] ) and ( [ pagemeanentropy ] ) , we can clearly write , simply , that whenever @xmath489 , @xmath490 ( since , when @xmath91 and @xmath48 are both of order 1 , the entropy can anyway only be of order 1 ) and hence , combining this result with @xmath91 and @xmath48 interchanged with the equality of @xmath491 and @xmath492 @xcite ( by which we mean the reduced density operator of @xmath493 on @xmath92  see section [ sect : haar ] ) @xmath494    in the remainder of part  2 , we first introduce , in section [ sect : haar ] , a useful coordinatization for unit vectors in an @xmath206-dimensional hilbert space in terms of which the ` haar ' measure of section [ sect : intro ] takes a particularly convenient form . in order to prepare the ground for our subsequent generalization ( see below )",
    "we then use this coordinatization to obtain an alternative derivation of lubkin s result ( [ lubkinmeanrhosquared ] ) .",
    "we also discuss in more detail the qualitative consequence of lubkin s result concerning the ` almost maximal mixedness ' of the density operator @xmath94 when @xmath485 ( as previously pointed out by lubkin , as mentioned in section [ sect : intro ] ) and we also point out a related important second qualitative consequence concerning the nature of @xmath94 in the ` opposite ' situation when @xmath495 .",
    "then , in section [ sect : main ] , we use a generalization of our alternative derivation of equation ( [ lubkinmeanrhosquared ] ) as well as a suitable generalization of our argument for its two qualitative consequences to give the full statement of equation ( [ purereduced ] ) including an explanation of how the @xmath112-dimensional subspace of the ( @xmath113-dimensional ) energy-@xmath21 subspace of @xmath24 spanned by the @xmath111 depend on @xmath85 and also to give our argument for the validity of our proposition ( stated in full in section [ sect : ans ] ) that @xmath86 ( see the discussion after ( [ purereduced ] ) ) is well approximated by the @xmath240 of equation ( [ purereduced ] ) .",
    "we end , in section [ sect : further ] , with two calculations which provide confirmatory evidence of the goodness of our approximation in situations such as those we discuss in part  1 .",
    "let @xmath32 be an @xmath206-dimensional hilbert space and let @xmath496 be an arbitrary orthonormal basis . then , as usual , we coordinatize an arbitrary vector , @xmath497 , by the @xmath206-tuple of complex numbers @xmath498 where @xmath499 .",

    "as a partial check of various aspects of all of the above argument , and in justification of our latter remark , it is instructive first to consider the case where , for all @xmath21 ( @xmath739 ) in the range @xmath311 $ ] , we have @xmath740 where , of course it is _ never _ true that @xmath714 or that @xmath741 ( nor that each of these quantities is very much greater than 1 ! )",

    "therefore , since this does nt depend on the @xmath748 , its average over haar measure ( indicated with `` @xmath554 '' ) takes the same value : @xmath749 on the other hand , the average over haar measure of the exact mean energy , @xmath750 , may be calculated as follows : @xmath751 @xmath752 where the integral is over the complex @xmath34-dimensional sphere of unit vectors in the hilbert space , @xmath687 , spanned by the vectors of form ( [ psisho ] ) , coordinatized with @xmath753 ranging over the ( @xmath34 - 1)-simplex and @xmath754 ranging over the @xmath34-torus as explained at the beginning of section [ sect : haar ] , where @xmath755 etc .",
    "obviously the torus factor of the integral just gives 1 , so the integral has , by ( [ j1 ] ) , the value @xmath756 for each @xmath21 .",
    "so we conclude that @xmath757 has the same value as @xmath758 , i.e. @xmath759 which , of course , has to be the correct value by the symmetry under the interchange of s and b in this case .    turning to averages over haar measure of the trace of the square of the reduced density operator of s , we have , on the one hand , @xmath760 @xmath761 whereas , on the other hand , @xmath762 ( where we have used ( [ j11 ] ) in calculating the integral ) which differs from the approximate value by a factor of 2 !    however , if we turn to calculate the averages over haar measure of the von neumann entropies of the approximate and exact reduced density operator of s , we find , on the one hand , @xmath763 on the other hand , @xmath764",

    "of course this restricted average , ` @xmath780 $ ] ' , is a basis - dependent notion , but what we have learnt is that we can choose any bases ( @xmath785 and @xmath786 ) we like and we obtain this reasonably good approximation to the unrestricted average ( at least for the quantity @xmath787 ) .",

    "however we retain the system and energy - bath terminology and notation to maintain contact with the literature in which s is assumed smaller than b. one drawback is that we use the same letter for both system and entropy but we do make them distinguishable by reserving a roman font ( s ) for system and italic ( @xmath8 ) for entropy .    for a discussion of how our proposal differs from the currently standard ` modern ' approach ( as we are calling it here ) see especially endnote ( xii ) in @xcite , where detailed arguments are given for our claim that our proposal offers an understanding of black hole entropy and also of cosmological entropy  while the ` modern ' approach by itself , as it would usually be understood , does nt . in our view , to put thermodynamics on a proper foundation , it is necessary to adopt _ both _ what we call here the ` modern ' approach as well as our matter - gravity entanglement hypothesis . without the latter , it makes no sense , for example , to ascribe to the whole universe any other entropy value than zero !        our gaussian approximation ( [ binomapprox ] ) to @xmath832 ( [ binomial ] ) , is not the same as the more usual approximation @xcite which relates the binomial and gaussian distributions but it has an amusing relationship to it .",
    "the latter , more usual , approximation is , when ( for simplicity ) we again assume that @xmath171 is an integer , the statement @xmath833 to understand the relationship between ( [ binomapprox ] ) and ( [ gaussapprox ] ) consider , for example the case where @xmath834 and @xmath835",
    ". then ( [ gaussapprox ] ) with , say , @xmath836 tells us that if one tosses a fair coin a hundred times , then the probability of getting 52 heads and 48 tails ( or vice versa ) is approximately @xmath837 times the probability of getting 50 heads and 50 tails . on the other hand , ( [ binomapprox ] ) with @xmath838 tells us that the same quantity ( i.e.  @xmath837 times the probability of getting 50 heads and 50 tails when tossing a fair coin a hundred times ) is also an approximation to the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails when one tosses a hundred times a biased coin which has a probability @xmath839 of landing heads on each throw ( or of landing tails on each throw ) .",
    "the fact that these two distinct probabilities are approximately equal is , arguably , intuitively obvious .",

    "<S> it is well - known that a small system weakly coupled to a large energy bath will , when the total system is in a microcanonical ensemble , find itself to be in an ( approximately ) thermal state ( i.e.  canonical ensemble ) and , recently , it has been shown that , if the total state is , instead , a random pure state with energy in a narrow range , then the small system will still be approximately thermal with a high probability ( defined by ` haar measure ' on the total hilbert space ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we ask what conditions are required for something resembling either / both of these ` traditional ' and ` modern ' thermality results to still hold when the system and energy bath are _ of comparable size_. in part  1 , we show that , for given system and energy - bath densities of states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , thermality does not hold in general , as we illustrate when @xmath2 and @xmath3 both increase as powers of energy , but that it does hold in certain approximate senses , in both traditional and modern frameworks , when @xmath2 and @xmath3 both grow as @xmath4 or as @xmath5 ( for constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and we calculate the system entropy in these cases . in their ` modern ' version , </S>",
    "<S> our results rely on new quantities , which we introduce and call the @xmath8 and @xmath9 ` modapprox ' density operators , which are defined for any positively supported , monotonically increasing , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and which , we claim , will , with high probability , closely approximate the reduced density operators for the system and energy bath when the total state of system plus energy bath is a random pure state with energy in a narrow range . in part  </S>",

    "<S> the prime examples of non - small thermal systems are quantum black holes . here and in two companion papers </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that current string - theoretic derivations of black hole entropy and thermal properties are incomplete and , on the question of information loss , inconclusive . </S>",
