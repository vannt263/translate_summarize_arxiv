    "one of the most striking characteristics of the galaxy population is the well - known environmental segregation of the two main galaxy types : red , early - type galaxies with little ongoing star formation preferentially occur in galaxy groups and clusters , while blue , late - type galaxies with significant star - formation activity avoid such systems and preferentially populate the `` field '' .",
    "this observation has been recognized as a key to understanding galaxy formation and evolution for more than fifty years @xcite .",
    "there is now overwhelming evidence that the galaxy population in clusters has evolved significantly with redshift down to the present day .",
    "@xcite were the first to present evidence that the fraction of blue galaxies , @xmath7 , in clusters increases strongly with increasing @xmath1the so - called butcher - oemler ( bo ) effect .",
    "this basic result  an increased incidence of star - forming galaxies in distant clusters  has been replicated in numerous later studies using a variety of star - formation indicators , including cluster blue fractions @xcite , emission - line galaxy fractions @xcite , and morphological fractions @xcite .",
    "such studies have also been extended to less massive galaxy groups @xcite , which also appear to have proportionally more star - forming galaxies back in time . to be sure ,",
    "there remain strong reasons to question the veracity of the bo effect as it was _ originally _ presented for galaxies in the _ cores _ of _ rich _ clusters ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "but it is now indisputable that clusters , on the whole , had proportionally more blue , star - forming , and morphologically late - type galaxies  in short , more star formation  at @xmath8 than they do at present .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that this evolution is responsible for the substantial growth that has been observed in the number density of red galaxies since @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "but it is also important to note that , in addition to evolution _ within _ the group and cluster environment , the build - up of the red galaxy population",
    "could also be driven by an _ increasing number density _ of groups and clusters from the growth of structure .",
    "we shall try in this paper to shed light on the relative importance in deep2 of these two channels for red - galaxy formation .",
    "a blue fraction that declines with time in groups and clusters is a natural consequence of hierarchical schemes for galaxy formation if one assumes that groups and clusters play a role in quenching star formation . since these systems form at relatively late times ,",
    "their member galaxies at intermediate redshift will have had less time , on average , to `` feel '' the effects of group membership ; thus , a smaller fraction of them will have ceased forming stars .",
    "indeed , it has been shown @xcite that the evolution of @xmath7 in clusters out to @xmath9 can be entirely accounted for by considering the effects of hierarchical structure formation and a declining universal star - formation rate .",
    "for exactness in what follows , then , we shall use the phrase `` butcher - oemler effect '' to refer just to this effect  a decline in the typical blue fraction in groups and clusters that results _ simply _ from the increasing age of these systems with time , and _ not _ from any evolution in the quenching efficiency of groups and clusters .",
    "although this working definition differs somewhat from the effect originally reported by @xcite , it reflects usage that has become common in recent literature .",
    "it is also worth noting that , under this definition , the bo effect may be stronger in some types of systems than in others ( in clusters than in groups , for example ) , depending on the accretion rates and quenching efficiencies involved .    it remains unclear , however , which specific physical mechanisms are responsible for quenching star formation , over what timescales they act , and even whether these mechanisms are peculiar to groups and clusters .",
    "a variety of mechanisms has been proposed , including ( _ 1 _ ) galaxy mergers ( _ e.g _ , @xcite ) , which occur primarily in galaxy groups ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) and can trigger agn feedback that sweeps merger remnants of their gas ( @xcite ) ; ( _ 2 _ ) close , high - velocity galaxy encounters ( `` harrassment '' ; @xcite ) , which occur primarily in clusters ; ( _ 3 _ ) ram - pressure stripping of galaxy gas by the hot intracluster medium ( @xcite ) ; and ( _ 4 _ ) the less violent process known as `` strangulation '' in which gas accretion onto galaxy discs is cut off , either by stripping of galaxies gaseous haloes ( @xcite ) or by feedback from low - luminosity agn @xcite , and star formation ends when the remaining supply of gas has been exhausted .",
    "there is evidence that each of these processes is at work on some level ; it may be that no single mechanism bears primary responsibility for galaxy evolution .",
    "disentangling how and to what degree each of the above processes shapes the galaxy population requires detailed observations of galaxies over a wide range of redshifts and environments .",
    "the observed evolution is rather complicated in its details , however .",
    "for example , the well - known morphology - density relation for galaxies in clusters ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) and groups ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) evolves strongly with increasing redshift @xcite , and there is evidence that the evolution in intermediate - density environments has occured more recently than in high - density environments @xcite .",
    "it also appears that the morphological mix of cluster early - types has changed with time @xcite . complicating things further",
    ", cluster blue fractions display a substantial system - to - system scatter at all epochs @xcite .",
    "this scatter can be ascribed in part to the observed trends between blue fraction and cluster mass , _",
    "i.e. _ , velocity dispersion @xcite , inferred virial mass @xcite , richness @xcite , or total optical luminosity @xcite ; the correlation between @xmath7 and mass also appears to evolve with redshift @xcite .",
    "the scatter may also arise in part from a correlation between @xmath7 and a cluster s degree of dynamical relaxation ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the scatter in @xmath7 might mask or enhance the redshift evolution , depending on the cluster selection criteria used @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite observe no bo effect out to @xmath10 in a sample of luminous x - ray clusters ( but see also @xcite ) , and many authors have commented on the presence of individual massive clusters at high redshift with low @xmath7 and well - formed red sequences ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that a robust study of galaxy evolution in groups and clusters requires a sample that contains a broad range of systems and is uniformly selected at all redshifts .",
    "until relatively recently , studies of galaxy evolution in clusters were limited to cluster samples pre - selected from optical imaging or x - ray maps ; such samples are prone to selection effects that bias the galaxy sample as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the advent of large , densely sampled galaxy redshift surveys like the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , however , has allowed selection of large , low - redshift cluster samples directly from the galaxy distribution in redshift space , where redshift - dependent selection effects can be well understood and accounted for .",
    "several authors have studied the properties of the cluster galaxy population in the 2dfgrs @xcite and sdss @xcite . within sdss ,",
    "there have even been detections of an evolving @xmath7 in clusters @xcite and of an evolving morphology - density relation @xcite . with the high - redshift deep2 galaxy redshift survey ( @xcite , faber et al . in prep . )",
    "nearing completion , it is now possible to extend these studies to @xmath2 .",
    "deep2 has now yielded a catalogue of several thousand groups and small clusters over a wide range of masses at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a study of the deep2 sample by @xcite has already revealed that , _ without _ explicitly considering groups , the correlations between galaxy properties and the density of the nearby galaxy distribution are qualitatively similar at @xmath2 to what is observed locally ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , although the relations differ in detail .",
    "interestingly , recent studies have shown that these correlations evolve with redshift , becoming stronger over time @xcite , and that the color - density relation in the _ local _ universe can be ascribed almost entirely to mechanisms acting in groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this paper , then , is to establish the role that groups and clusters play , if any , in driving the evolution of the deep2 galaxy population . in particular",
    ", we shall explore the possibility that group and cluster environments are responsible for the build - up of red galaxies observed over the deep2 redshift range @xcite ; by so doing , we will try to shed light on the physical mechanisms driving the evolution .",
    "although this study will focus on the evolutionary effects of galaxies membership in groups and clusters ( that is to say , of their dark matter halo masses ) , there is important complementary information to be gained by studying the effects of the local density of galaxies .",
    "such a study is undertaken in a companion paper to this one by @xcite .",
    "for now , however , we will measure @xmath7 for galaxies in groups and clusters , as a function of redshift , and compare it to that found in the general field ( _ i.e. _ , in the galaxy population outside of groups ) .",
    "we will also investigate the relation between @xmath7 and cluster properties in order to gain insight into the processes at work and also to understand and control any systematic selection effects .",
    "the thoughtful reader may find it perverse to use the _ blue _ fraction to study the evolution of _ red _ galaxies , but @xmath7 has significant historical precedent in the study of cluster galaxy populations , so we use it for consistency with earlier studies . in any case , the possibly more natural _ red _ fraction statistic is simply @xmath11 .",
    "we have chosen to consider galaxy _",
    "colour _ rather than other indicators of galaxy type like morphology or [ o ii ] line emission primarily because it can be measured accurately for the largest number of deep2 galaxies , allowing for robust statistics .",
    "the deep2 ground - based imaging lacks the resolution necessary for morphological classification of most galaxies at @xmath2 , and there is _ hst _ imaging for only a small fraction of the sample .",
    "emission line strength can be measured accurately only in spectra with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ; not all deep2 galaxies meet this criterion . also , it has recently been shown that [ o ii ] emission may not give a clear indication of star formation , especially in red galaxies @xcite .",
    "regardless , there is a strong and relatively tight correlation between [ o ii ] equivalent width and galaxy colour(_e.g .",
    "_ , @xcite ) , so the two statistics should give similar results .",
    "we shall proceed as follows . in  [",
    "sec : deep2 ] , we describe the deep2 survey and the deep2 group catalogue , and in  [ sec : mocks ] we discuss the construction of mock deep2 galaxy catalogues appropriate for this study .",
    "we describe our galaxy selection criteria and incompleteness corrections and present the precise definition of @xmath7 used here in  [ sec : selection ] .",
    "measurements of @xmath7 in groups and the field are presented in  [ sec : results ] , and we perform tests with the mock catalogues in   [ sec : mock_tests ] . we discuss the implications of our results for galaxy evolution models in  [ sec : discussion ] , and in  [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "readers uninterested in the details of our selection methods and robustness checks should skip to  ",
    "[ sec : sampledef ] , [ sec : results ] and [ sec : discussion ] . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a flat , @xmath12cdm cosmology with @xmath13 .",
    "the deep2 galaxy redshift survey is the first large , highly accurate spectroscopic survey of galaxies at redshifts around unity . as of this writing ,",
    "the main survey observations are nearly complete ( @xmath14 ) , with spectra obtained for @xmath15 galaxies in four fields using the deimos spectrograph on the keck ii telescope .",
    "the survey covers a total of @xmath16 on the sky to limiting magnitude @xmath17 .",
    "the bulk of these observations are of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath18 .",
    "full details of the survey will appear in the upcoming paper by faber et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , but summarize the necessary information for this study is summarized below .",
    "the four fields surveyed were chosen to lie in zones of low galactic extinction using the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "three - band ( @xmath19 ) photometry was obtained for each field using the cfh12k camera on the canada - france - hawaii telescope , as described by @xcite .",
    "each field is covered by several contiguous photometric pointings , which are a convenient way to group and intercompare results .",
    "three of the deep2 fields each cover an area @xmath20 or @xmath21 on the sky with two or three contiguous pointings . in these fields ,",
    "galaxies are selected for spectroscopy using a simple cut in @xmath19 colour - colour space that has been optimized to select galaxies at redshifts @xmath22 .",
    "this cut efficiently focuses the survey on high - redshift galaxies : it reduces the portion of the spectroscopic sample at redshifts @xmath23 to roughly @xmath24 while discarding only @xmath25 of objects at @xmath22 ( faber et al . in preparation ) . within each cfht pointing , galaxies are selected for spectroscopic observation if it is possible to place them on one of the @xmath26 deimos slit masks covering that pointing .",
    "slit masks are tiled in an overlapping chevron pattern using an adaptive algorithm to increase the coverage in dense regions on the sky , giving nearly every galaxy two chances to be placed on a mask .",
    "further details of the observing scheme are given in @xcite ; overall deep2 targets @xmath27 of galaxies that meet its selection criteria .",
    "the fourth field of the survey , the extended groth strip ( hereafter egs ) , covers @xmath28 on the sky .",
    "a concerted effort is underway by a large consortium of observing teams ( the aegis team ; @xcite ) to obtain a wide array of observations of this field from x - ray to radio wavelengths .",
    "therefore , to maximize the evolutionary information that will be available , galaxies in the egs have been targeted for spectroscopy regardless of estimated redshift , and at a significantly higher sampling rate than in other fields : each galaxy in egs has four chances to be selected for observation rather than two .",
    "this means that galaxies selected for spectroscopy in the egs constitute a superset of galaxies that would have been selected using the criteria of the other three deep2 fields ; hence it is possible to create a high - redshift subsample of the egs whose selection ( including sampling rate ) is identical to that of the rest of the deep2 survey .",
    "we will include this subsample in the present study .    at this writing",
    ", spectroscopic observations have been completed for all three of the high - redshift deep2 fields and for more than three - quarters of the egs field .",
    "all deep2 spectra have been reduced using an automated data - reduction pipeline ( cooper et al . in preparation ) , and redshift identifications are all confirmed visually . rest - frame @xmath29 colours and absolute @xmath30 magnitudes are computed using the k - correction algorithm described in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "this study uses data from all of the deep2 cfht pointings for which spectroscopic observations have been completed . in each pointing",
    ", the fraction of the spectra that yield a successful redshift is greater than @xmath31 .",
    "the details of the deep2 group - finding procedure are fully discussed in @xcite ; we have now applied this procedure to the full current deep2 dataset , which is significantly larger than that used in the previous paper .",
    "we summarize the salient points of the group - finding algorithm here .",
    "groups of galaxies in the deep2 sample are identified using the voronoi - delaunay method ( vdm ) group finder , which was originally implemented by @xcite",
    ". this group finder searches adaptively for groups ( bound , virialized associations of two or more observed galaxies ) using information about local density derived from the voronoi partition and delaunay complex of a given three - dimensional galaxy sample .",
    "@xcite calibrated the vdm group finder using the mock catalogues of @xcite , achieving the primary goal of accurately reconstructing the bivariate distribution @xmath32 of groups as a function of redshift and velocity dispersion for dispersions @xmath33 .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , however , we will be considering the properties of galaxies , rather than group properties , so we will focus on somewhat different measures of success here .",
    "in particular , this paper studies properties of the population of galaxies within groups ( the _ group sample _ ) and of the population of isolated galaxies ( the _ field sample _ ) , so it is crucial to determine the success of the vdm at identifying each of these populations . by testing the vdm group finder on mock deep2 catalogues",
    ", @xcite showed that the fraction of real group members that are successfully identified as such ( the _ galaxy success rate _ , @xmath34 ) is @xmath35 .",
    "conversely , the fraction of galaxies in the reconstructed group population that are actually misclassified field galaxies ( the _ interloper fraction _ , @xmath36 ) is @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , @xmath38 of field galaxies are correctly identified , while only @xmath39 of the reconstructed field sample is made up of misclassified group members .",
    "both samples ( group and field ) are thus dominated by correctly classified galaxies , but each sample is contaminated by galaxies from the other . therefore , any differences between the group and field galaxies should be somewhat stronger in reality than what the vdm reconstructs .",
    "as will be discussed below in   [ sec : sampledef ] , the contamination of the group sample is particularly bad for groups with velocity dispersion below @xmath40 , so we will reclassify galaxies in these groups as field galaxies .    finally , it is important to note here that groups in the deep2 survey are typically of modest mass .",
    "the mock catalogues of @xcite indicate that the bulk of the deep2 groups should have virial masses in the range @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , with very few groups having @xmath43 ; this is consistent with the estimates of the minimum group mass derived from the autocorrelation function of deep2 groups @xcite . in what follows , then",
    ", any conclusions drawn about the properties of groups should not be taken to apply to rich clusters .",
    "the study of groups and clusters of galaxies is fraught with unavoidable sources of systematic error .",
    "for example , it has been shown @xcite that an error - free cluster catalogue is not achievable for an incompletely sampled galaxy distribution , even if the physical distances to the galaxies are known . moreover , in a redshift survey the peculiar velocities of galaxies induce distortions in the redshift - space distribution of galaxies , mixing the positions of galaxies in groups with the positions of isolated galaxies and making accurate group detection even more difficult .",
    "because of these unavoidable sources of systematic error , robust conclusions require that we test our methods on realistic mock galaxy catalogues .",
    "@xcite tested and calibrated their group - finding methods with the mock catalogues of @xcite .",
    "these catalogues were produced by populating dark - matter - only n - body simulations with galaxies following a halo model prescription that follows @xcite .",
    "in particular , the mocks are populated using a conditional luminosity function , @xmath44 , that assigns galaxies to a halo of mass @xmath45 according to a luminosity function whose parameters depend on @xmath45 .",
    "the parameters of the model were chosen to be consistent with the two - point correlation function @xmath46 observed in early deep2 data @xcite and with the local @xmath46 from peacock et al .",
    "these mocks were sufficient for the purpose of testing our overall success at reconstructing groups , but they do not provide information about galaxy properties aside from luminosity .    in the current work we shall need to test our success at reproducing the colours of the group galaxy population ; this requires mock catalogues that include that information .",
    "the mocks must also reproduce any dependences of the galaxy colour distribution on local overdensity , since that is the trend we aim to probe in the data . to this end",
    ", we assign colours to mock galaxies by drawing colours from galaxies in similar environments within the actual deep2 data .",
    "this method is similar to , but less sophisticated than , the one used by wechsler et al .",
    "( in preparation ) to create the mock sdss catalogues that were used to test the c4 group - finding algorithm @xcite .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "local galaxy density in the deep2 data is measured by computing the distance ( projected on the sky ) to each galaxy s third - nearest neighbor within @xmath47 in redshift , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "deep2 galaxies contaminated by edge effects are discarded , and the data sample is limited to galaxies in the range @xmath48 to minimize the effect of the apparent magnitude limit . in the mock catalogue , local density",
    "is estimated using the projected distance to the _",
    "seventh_-nearest neighbor ( within a catalogue of an enhanced spatial extent , to avoid edge effects in the final catalogue ) . the seventh - nearest neighbor in the complete , volume - limited mock catalogue has been shown to be a reasonable analogue to the third - nearest neighbor measured in the more sparsely sampled magnitude - limited data @xcite .",
    "we then divide both the mock and data samples into quintiles of local density and identify each quintile in the data with the quintile in the mock that has the same local - density rank .",
    "the colour distributions within each density bin in the data can then be used to assign colours to the mock galaxies .",
    "for example , the @xmath49 of mock galaxies with the highest local densities will be assigned colours randomly drawn from the observed colour distribution of the highest - density @xmath49 of deep2 galaxies .    before doing this , however , we also divide the samples by luminosity , since deep2 galaxy colour is observed to be correlated with luminosity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the deep2 data , we sort galaxies into four bins in absolute @xmath30 band magnitude .",
    "to ensure that similar parts of the luminosity function are being considered at all @xmath1 , we shift these bins with redshift to account for evolution in the typical galaxy magnitude @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite found that this value evolves as @xmath51 , with @xmath52 ; we apply the same linear function of @xmath1 to our luminosity binning of the data .",
    "the bins include only galaxies brighter than @xmath53 , since the sample is incomplete for fainter magnitudes ( see figure  [ fig : colmag ] ) , and each bin is 0.5 magnitudes wide , except for the brightest bin , which includes all galaxies brighter than @xmath54 .",
    "the mock catalogue is divided into the same four bins , except that in this case the bins evolve with redshift as @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , the @xmath50 evolution parameter that was assumed in @xcite .",
    "also the faintest bin in the mocks includes all galaxies fainter than @xmath57 , which means that all mock galaxies fainter than this limit will have the same colour distribution as deep2 galaxies in the range @xmath58 .",
    "this is the best that can be done using this procedure , since the deep2 sample is incomplete for fainter objects ; in any event , most of the mock galaxies in this regime will fall below the deep2 apparent magnitude limit , so there is little practical effect .",
    "having divided the samples thus into bins of local overdensity and absolute magnitude , we then add colours to the mock population by considering galaxies in each bin separately . for each mock galaxy in a given luminosity - density bin ,",
    "a real galaxy is selected at random from the corresponding bin in the deep2 data sample , and we assign that galaxy s rest - frame @xmath29 colour to the mock galaxy in question .",
    "this procedure produces a distribution in @xmath59 vs. @xmath29 colour - magnitude space that matches the distribution observed in deep2 reasonably well ( see figure  [ fig : chromo_cmd ] ) . because the procedure only uses deep2 galaxies in the range @xmath48 and",
    "because it does not divide the samples by redshift , any intrinsic evolution in the colours of deep2 galaxies will not be reproduced in the mock catalogues .",
    "this is desirable , however , since it will allow us to confirm that our selection and group - finding procedures have not introduced any spurious evolutionary trends .    using the colours assigned to the mock galaxies , it is possible to the k - correction procedure described in @xcite to assign each galaxy an @xmath60-band apparent magnitude , which can be used to select mock galaxies with the same @xmath61 apparent magnitude limit that is used in deep2 .",
    "in addition to this magnitude limit , we also apply the deep2 deimos slitmask - making algorithm to the mock catalogue , as projected on the sky , removing those galaxies that would not be targeted for observation .",
    "finally , we dilute the remaining galaxy sample to reproduce the @xmath62 redshift success rate of the survey ; the dilution procedure accounts for the slight magnitude dependence of this rate .",
    "because the deep2 survey extends over a broad redshift range ( @xmath63 ) , selecting galaxies according to a simple apparent magnitude limit introduces selection effects that depend strongly on a galaxy s rest - frame colour .",
    "for example , the deep2 @xmath64 magnitude limit corresponds to selection in the rest - frame @xmath30 band at @xmath65 and the rest - frame @xmath66 band at @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , galaxies with intrinsically red colours will fall beyond the selection cut at lower redshifts than those with intrinsically blue colours .",
    "this effect is readily apparent in figure  [ fig : colmag ] , which shows rest - frame colour - magnitude diagrams ( @xmath59 vs. @xmath68 ) for deep2 galaxies , divided into redshift bins of width @xmath69 . in each panel ,",
    "distinct red and blue galaxy populations are apparent , with loci that are roughly divided by the dotted lines .",
    "the sharp cutoff in the galaxy population on the right side of each panel is caused by the deep2 apparent magnitude limit ; this selection cut becomes increasingly biased against red galaxies as redshift increases and the observed @xmath60 band moves further blueward of the rest - frame @xmath30 band .",
    "it is obviously necessary to take this effect into account when studying the redshift evolution of the blue fraction . in particular",
    ", we must ensure that galaxies of a given colour have been equally well sampled at all redshifts being considered .",
    "the simplest selection method is to produce a volume - limited catalogue with an absolute magnitude limit_i.e .",
    "_ , a vertical selection cut in colour - magnitude space",
    ". for deep2 , however , this method severely restricts either the redshift range probed or the number of galaxies selected .",
    "for example , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : colmag ] , a limiting absolute magnitude of @xmath70 would allow measurement of @xmath7 only out to redshift @xmath71 ; beyond this , the red galaxy sample would be incomplete , resulting in a spurious sharp rise in @xmath7 at all higher redshifts . on the other hand , a limiting magnitude of @xmath72 would give a complete , volume - limited sample out to @xmath73 , but",
    "such a sample would contain far too few galaxies for a robust measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "however , to examine the evolution of galaxy properties , all that is required is to select a region of colour - magnitude space that is uniformly sampled by the survey at all redshifts of interest .",
    "such a selection cut is shown by the dashed curves in each panel of figure  [ fig : colmag ] , which are described by the equation @xmath74,\\ [ c(u - b ) +          d]\\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 ( equal to @xmath76 in the figure ) is the limiting redshift beyond which the selected sample becomes incomplete , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are constants that depend on @xmath75 and are determined by inspection of the colour - magnitude diagrams , and @xmath79 is a constant that allows for linear redshift evolution of the typical galaxy luminosity @xmath80 , as already mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : mocks ] .",
    "@xcite have measured the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function using data from combo-17  @xcite and deep2 at @xmath2 in conjunction with low-@xmath1 data from the 2dfgrs @xcite and sdss @xcite ; they find that changes in @xmath80 are well described by a linear evolution model , @xmath81 , with @xmath52 .",
    "by including this evolution in our selection cut , we are selecting a similar population of galaxies _ with respect to @xmath80 _ at all redshifts .",
    "we use equation  [ eqn : magcut ] to define three different samples , called samples ii , iii and iv , which are complete in colour - magnitude space to @xmath82 and @xmath76 , respectively ; the parameters defining these samples are given in table  [ tab : samples ] .",
    "in addition , we create a sample , called sample i , that is purely absolute - magnitude - limited ( relative to @xmath50 ) and complete to @xmath83 by applying a simple cut at @xmath84 .",
    "table  [ tab : samples ] summarizes the properties of the resulting samples , and figure  [ fig : samplegals ] shows colour - magnitude and colour - redshift diagrams for the galaxies in each sample .",
    "these samples should also be useful for future studies of colour evolution in deep2 .    selecting galaxy samples according to equation  [ eqn : magcut ] ,",
    "effectively creates a sample that is volume - limited _ for each colour_. that is , the selection is colour - dependent , but the magnitude limit relative to @xmath50 is redshift - independent .",
    "this selection is different than the traditional volume - limited selection , but it nevertheless allows for comparison of the relative numbers of galaxies of different colours at different redshifts ; that is , it allows us to examine the evolution of the blue fraction",
    ". it should be noted , however , that our values of @xmath7 can not be meaningfully compared to published values at low redshift , which have typically been computed using a simple magnitude cut . in particular , our values of @xmath7",
    "will be much higher than local values from the literature since the magnitude cut in equation  [ eqn : magcut ] selects many more blue galaxies than red .",
    "indeed , @xmath7 values can not even be compared among the different samples defined in table  [ tab : samples ] .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath7 in each sample are mainly set by the selection ; useful information comes only from splitting these samples into subsamples to look for _ trends _ with redshift or with galaxy properties .",
    "before we move on , it is important to note that the application of our colour - magnitude selection criteria has important implications for the definitions of our group and field samples .",
    "the vdm group catalogue has been defined using the entire apparent - magnitude - limited survey .",
    "it is thus possible that a group could have been detected with two or more members at @xmath85 , say , while only one of these members is brigher than @xmath86 .",
    "had this group instead been at @xmath73 , it clearly would not have been identified , and its one bright galaxy would have been considered to lie in the field . if no correction is made for this effect , the application of @xmath86 will cause a redshift nonuniformity in our samples , with galaxies from relatively faint groups being counted as group members at low @xmath1 and as field members at high @xmath1 . to avoid such biases , we redefine the group sample to be only those galaxies that reside in groups with two or more members brighter than @xmath86 .",
    "the field sample comprises all other galaxies .",
    "we also define a group s richness @xmath87 to be the number of galaxies with @xmath88 instead of the total number of observed galaxies , so that richness is measured consistently at all @xmath1 ( other group properties , like @xmath89 and mean @xmath1 , are still computed using _ all _ observed group members , for the sake of robustness ) .",
    "this group definition ensures that our sample of group galaxies is drawn from comparable groups at all @xmath1 , although it means that a given group may have a different value of @xmath87 in each sample . also , throughout this paper we will restrict the group galaxy sample to those galaxies whose host groups have velocity dispersions @xmath90 .",
    "this is because , as shown in @xcite ( see figure 8 of that paper ) , groups with lower velocity dispersion are predominantly false detections .",
    "we therefore class galaxies in such groups with the field sample .",
    "this point is discussed further in   [ sec : fb_local_trends ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : samplehists ] shows the distribution of groups and their member galaxies as a function of @xmath87 and @xmath89 for each of the four samples .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      before we may proceed with measuring @xmath7 , an additional effect must be accounted for .",
    "because of the finite slit length available on the deimos spectrograph , deep2 can target for spectroscopy only @xmath27 of the galaxies that meet its selection criteria ( we will call the remaining potential targets `` unobserved galaxies '' ) . moreover , @xmath91 of galaxies that are targeted for spectroscopic observation fail to yield redshifts ( we will call these `` redshift failures '' ) .",
    "follow - up observations have shown that many ( @xmath92 ) of the redshift failures , especially for blue galaxies , lie at redshifts beyond the range probed by deep2 ( c. steidel , private communication ) .",
    "the overall failure rate is also correlated with observed galaxy colour and magnitude , although the trends are only slight .",
    "other failures may occur because of poor observing conditions , data reduction errors ( e.g. , poor subtraction of night - sky emission ) , or instrumental effects ( e.g. , bad ccd pixels ) , but such problems are only a minor contribution to the overall failure rate . these various sources of incompleteness may introduce spurious evolutionary trends in @xmath7 unless an appropriate correction is applied .    in this work",
    "we adopt the corrective weighting scheme used by @xcite in measuring the deep2 luminosity function . a method of this sort was first implemented by @xcite for the cnoc2 redshift survey .",
    "we locate each galaxy in the three - dimensional space defined by observed @xmath60 magnitude and @xmath93 and @xmath94 colours .",
    "we then define a cubical bin ( 0.25 magnitudes on a side ) in this space around each galaxy with a successful redshift and compute a weight for the @xmath95th such galaxy : @xmath96 here @xmath97 is the number of galaxies in the bin around galaxy @xmath95 with successful redshifts within the nominal deep2 redshift range ( @xmath98 ) , @xmath99 is an index that runs over all galaxies in the bin for which deep2 did not successfully measure a redshift ( whether they were observed or not ) , and @xmath100 denotes the probability that galaxy @xmath99 ( in the bin around galaxy @xmath95 ) falls in the nominal deep2 redshift range .    to compute the probability @xmath101 in equation  [ eqn : weight ] , we must construct a model for the redshift distributions of redshift failures _ and _ of unobserved galaxies . modeling this in detail would require additional assumptions , but it is reasonably certain that the truth lies between two extreme models .",
    "as noted previously , many of the failures are known to be at @xmath102 , so we can start by making the extreme assumption that _ all _ failures lie in this range . in this case , called the `` minimal '' model , all redshift failures have @xmath103 in equation  [ eqn : weight ] , and unobserved galaxies have @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the number of galaxies ( in the @xmath95th bin in colour - colour - magnitude space ) with redshifts observed to be below @xmath106 , @xmath107 is the number with @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is the number of observed galaxies that failed to yield a redshift . taking the opposite extreme , we could assume that redshift failures have exactly the same redshift range as the galaxies with successful redshifts . in this case , called the `` average '' model , both redshift failures and unobserved galaxies have the same value for @xmath110 : @xmath111 since blue galaxies with failed redshifts are known to be frequently beyond the deep2 redshift range , @xcite adopted a compromise model ( the `` optimal '' model ) , in which blue galaxies ( see   [ sec : computing_fb ] for the precise definition ) are corrected with the minimal model while red galaxies are weighted using the average model .",
    "we shall adopt this scheme in what follows ; however , our basic conclusions are insensitive to the weighting scheme used and in fact are unchanged even when no weighting is used .",
    "having defined a galaxy sample using equation  [ eqn : magcut ] and a set of galaxy weights @xmath112 using equation  [ eqn : weight ] , we may now compute @xmath7 for our chosen sample . as in @xcite",
    "we divide the galaxies into red and blue subsamples according to the observed bimodality in galaxy colours .",
    "this division corresponds to the dotted line shown in all panels of figure  [ fig : colmag ] , given by the equation @xmath113 which was derived from the @xcite colour - magnitude relation for red galaxies in distant clusters .",
    "[ eqn : colourcut ] shifts that relation downward by 0.25 magnitudes to pass through the valley in the colour distribution , following @xcite .",
    "one can also allow this colour division to evolve with redshift according to passive stellar evolution models ; however , there is no evidence in the deep2 data for any evolution in the position of the valley ( see figure  [ fig : colmag ] ) , and a realistic amount of evolution has only minimal effects on our results ( see  5.2 ) . in the interest of simplicity ,",
    "therefore , we do not allow the division to evolve in most of what follows .",
    "this division between red and blue galaxies produces a set of @xmath45 blue galaxies out of a total sample of @xmath87 galaxies , each of which is assigned a weight @xmath112 . the corrected blue fraction is then given by @xmath114 where the number of blue galaxies @xmath115 and the total number of galaxies @xmath116 are defined as @xmath117 with the index @xmath99 running over all of the blue galaxies and the index @xmath95 running over the full galaxy sample .      the formal error in @xmath7 is given by simple binomial statistics : @xmath118 ( except in the case @xmath119 , for which @xcite argue that @xmath120 ) .",
    "however , this formula will not fully account for the scatter in our measured values of @xmath7 .",
    "because a correlation exists in deep2 between local galaxy density and galaxy colour @xcite , large - scale structure will induce an intrinsic scatter in values of @xmath7 measured over a finite volume , in addition to the formal binomial error ; this can be thought of , in essence , as a contribution to the error from cosmic variance .",
    "we discuss the effects of this scatter further in ",
    "[ sec : fb_evol ] . also , errors in the galaxy weights @xmath112 will add scatter to the measured @xmath7 values .",
    "we therefore find it most convenient to estimate our errors empirically .",
    "we do this in three different ways to ensure that our methods are robust .",
    "first , we compute @xmath7 for each of the 10 deep2 photometric pointings individually and average those computed values ; the error @xmath121 is then taken to be the standard error on that mean .",
    "second , we estimate @xmath121 using a jackknife sampling strategy in which each pointing is removed in turn from the full dataset being considered , @xmath7 is computed for each subsample , and the error on @xmath7 for the full sample is estimated using the usual jackknife error formula . finally , we compute the errors on @xmath7 using a bootstrap resampling strategy in which the entire data subsample under consideration ( _ e.g. _ all group galaxies in a given redshift bin ) is randomly sampled with replacement , and the error on @xmath7 is estimated from the standard deviation of the @xmath7 distribution for 500 such monte - carlo samples , using standard bootstrap methods . in each case , the estimated error must be scaled up by a factor of @xmath122 to account for the covariance that exists between contiguous pointings due to large - scale structure fluctuations ( _ i.e. _ , cosmic variance ) .",
    "this factor is derived from monte carlo tests based on the covariance between fields with the actual deep2 geometry , using the cosmic variance calculation code of @xcite ; it corresponds to the conservative assumption that pointing - to - pointing variations in @xmath7 are dominated by cosmic variance .",
    "these three different methods give comparable results , though the standard - error and jackknife estimates are much noisier than those from bootstrapping . in the interest of stability , we will always report the bootstrap error values in what follows .",
    "it is , however , worth emphasizing that even this method may not account for all sources of @xmath7 variance in a given redshift bin , since the deep2 dataset is finite . because @xmath7 seems to be lower in higher - density regions ,",
    "if we are particularly unlucky and there is a net overdensity or underdensity at a given @xmath1 in most of the deep2 fields , this may lead to a fluctuation in @xmath7 that is not accounted for in our error bars . in particular , it appears that there may be an underdensity at @xmath123 in most of the deep2 fields ; this may lead to unusually high values of @xmath7 at that redshift . to ameliorate this problem , in addition to computing @xmath7 in independent bins",
    ", we will also sometimes compute @xmath7 in a sliding box , which will smooth out any large - scale structure fluctuations at the expense of introducing bin - to - bin correlations in the resulting measurements .",
    "table  [ tab : samples ] shows the properties of the four samples defined in   [ sec : sampledef ] , including blue fractions . a primary result of this work is apparent in the last two rows of the table : in all four samples considered , the blue fraction is significantly lower in groups than it is in the field .",
    "thus , the well - known _ qualitative _ distinction between local field and group ( or cluster ) galaxy populations was in place by @xmath124 .",
    "it is , however , worth emphasizing that the _ quantitative _ increase in @xmath7 values from sample i to sample iv is _ not _ evidence for evolution because the overall value of @xmath7 in each sample is strongly affected by the sample - selection procedures in ",
    "[ sec : sampledef ] ( _ i.e. _ , sample iv has a much more sharply tilted selection cut than sample ii , so it will include proportionally fewer red galaxies by construction ) . in what follows , we will divide each sample into redshift bins , allowing for a meaningful investigation of evolutionary trends in the blue fraction . first , though , it is important to understand the trends that exist at _ fixed _ redshift .      as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the blue fraction in local clusters exhibits a large system - to - system scatter that arises , at least in part , because the measured value of @xmath7 depends on exactly _ which _ galaxies and clusters are used to compute it ( e.g. , @xcite ) . before considering @xmath7 evolution in deep2 ,",
    "then , it is crucial to understand trends in the blue fraction at _ fixed _ redshift ; otherwise they may introduce selection effects that enhance or compete with evolutionary effects ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . as discussed in   [ sec : fb_evol ] below , there is little to no evolution in @xmath7 over the redshift range @xmath125 in deep2 , so we will limit ourselves to this range ( _ i.e. _ to samples i and ii ) when studying trends at fixed redshift .",
    "first , it is interesting to consider the effect of galaxy magnitude on the blue fraction . in doing this",
    ", it is important to use the same absolute magnitude cuts at all colours ( _ i.e. _ , vertical lines in figure  [ fig : colmag ] ) . if one instead used tilted cuts like the ones that define samples ii ",
    "iv ( equation  [ eqn : magcut ] ) , the extreme slopes of these cuts in colour - magnitude space would mean that the brightest magnitude bins would exclude all red galaxies while keeping some blue ones , leading to obviously spurious results .",
    "thus we are limited here to subsamples of sample i , the smallest sample in this study .",
    "it is also important to allow the magnitude bins to evolve with redshift in the same manner as @xmath50 , to ensure that similar galaxies are being compared across the redshift range .",
    "thus , we divide sample i into bins in the quantity @xmath126 , with @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fb_mag ] , shows @xmath7 in bins of absolute magnitude for galaxies in groups and in the field .",
    "groups here are defined to be those systems that have two or more members in sample i. a trend is evident for both populations , with brighter subsamples having a lower blue fraction  except for the brightest galaxies , where the trend may reverse .",
    "this last result is consistent with the results of @xcite , who find a population of bright , blue deep2 galaxies in high - density environments ; it can possibly be ascribed to agn and starburst activity .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the trends for the fainter group and field populations . fitting a straight line for each subsample , excluding the brightest bin , yields a slope of @xmath127 for the field population and @xmath128 for the group galaxies .",
    "that is , there is evidence for a similar trend with limiting magnitude for @xmath7 , both in groups and in the field .",
    "we will discuss the implications of this result in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .    we will use sample ii to explore other possible systematic trends in @xmath7 at fixed @xmath1 ,",
    "since it is significantly larger than sample i by virtue of the tilted colour - magnitude selection criterion used to define it .",
    "figure  [ fig : fb_cuts ] shows @xmath7 for the _ group _ galaxy population only , binnned by various group or galaxy properties .",
    "for comparison , the blue fraction for field galaxies is shown as a dotted line .",
    "the upper left panel shows the dependence of @xmath7 on the velocity dispersion @xmath89 of the galaxies host groups  that is , each bin contains all of the galaxies in groups with @xmath89 in the range of that bin . in this panel , we have included in the group sample those galaxies in groups with @xmath129 , unlike all other plots in this paper .",
    "as shown , in terms of @xmath7 these galaxies bear a much stronger resemblance to the field than to the rest of the group sample .",
    "this is no surprise , since these groups are known to be predominantly false detections_i.e .",
    "_ , chance associations of field galaxies @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fb_cuts ] then stands as further justification for our decision to class these galaxies with the field .",
    "the other data points in this panel show an interesting trend with @xmath89 : @xmath7 declinines with @xmath89 at low dispersion and then rises again at high dispersion .",
    "caution is warranted , however , because ( 1 ) high dispersion groups are more likely to be contaminated by interloper field galaxies , since the vdm group finder uses a larger search volume for such groups ; and ( 2 ) the large uncertainty in the measured values of @xmath89 for deep2 groups makes it difficult to assess the reality of observed trends of galaxy properties with group velocity dispersion .",
    "in particular , point ( 2 ) might be a problem because the sample has many groups with two members , for which measurements of @xmath89 are maximally uncertain .",
    "such groups might dominate over the population of _ true _ high - dispersion systems , which are rare . if there were , say , an underlying monotonic decline in @xmath7 with increasing @xmath89 ,",
    "then the up - scattered small groups could induce an apparent upturn at the high-@xmath89 end . for these reasons , we refrain from drawing conclusions regarding the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath89 .",
    "there is , however , an apparent trend with group richness , @xmath87 , at high values of @xmath87 , visible in the top right panel of the figure . richness in this context is defined to be the number of galaxies in a given group above the colour - magnitude limit @xmath130 that defines sample ii ( see equation  [ eqn : magcut ] and table  [ tab : samples ] ) .",
    "the blue fraction declines at the highest richness values .",
    "this result illustrates the primary reason that we included in our sample only those groups with two or more members above @xmath130 : had we not done so , we would have been sampling richer groups at higher redshifts , potentially causing a spurious decrease in @xmath7 with increasing redshift .",
    "the remaining four panels investigate the dependence of @xmath7 on group members distance from their host groups centres ( group - centric radius ) and on their peculiar velocity relative to their host groups .",
    "to probe dependence on group - centric radius , we compute @xmath7 for group galaxies within annuli on the sky around the mean right ascension and declination of their host group .",
    "the annuli are defined in two ways  in units of comoving mpc and also in units of @xmath131 , the radius at which the group is 200 times denser than the background .",
    "this radius can be estimated from the group s radial velocity dispersion @xmath132 as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the redshift - dependent hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "we compute each group member s peculiar velocity with respect to the mean redshift of its host group as @xmath135 , and we consider the peculiar velocity both in units of @xmath136 and normalized to the host group s velocity dispersion @xmath89 .",
    "the middle two panels of figure  [ fig : fb_cuts ] show the dependence of @xmath7 in groups on the group - centric distance , and the bottom two panels show the dependence on peculiar velocity .",
    "none of these plots shows a significant trend , and linear fits to the data points in each panel are consistent with zero slope .",
    "the lack of a trend with group - centric radius may be surprising in light of studies of groups and clusters at low ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) and high ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) redshift , showing a strong relation between cluster - centric radius and galaxy type .",
    "however , there is a large uncertainty in the determinations of deep2 group centres and mean redshifts since these involve taking means of a small number of objects , so it is likely that any trends would be significantly diluted by scatter in these values . here",
    "are @xmath137 , which is extremely large for any realistic system ; such values are attributable to groups with spuriously low measured values of @xmath89 and hence @xmath131 .",
    "] nevertheless , there is a hint in the lower left panel that galaxies at low values of @xmath138 and @xmath139 tend to be redder than the general group population .",
    "in addition , in the lower right panel it appears that group galaxies with moderate absolute peculiar velocities are redder than usual , while those with the highest velocities are blue .",
    "this echoes the trend with @xmath89 at upper left ( as expected , since only high-@xmath89 groups contain galaxies with high values of @xmath140 ) ; these two panels taken together suggest that a negative correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath89 for deep2 groups may be masked by the presence of interloper field galaxies that preferentially lie at high values of @xmath140",
    ". it would be preferable if we could compute fig .",
    "[ fig : fb_cuts ] using only high - richness groups , whose dispersions and centers can be determined more robustly ; however , restricting even to groups with @xmath141 reduces the sample size so significantly that no firm conclusions can be drawn in light of the resulting error bars .",
    "thus , in the absence of any significant measured trends , we see no justification for further restricting our sample by peculiar velocity or group - centric radius  for instance by taking only galaxies within @xmath131 as has been done in various other studies ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , in which it was possible to measure @xmath131 more robustly than it is here . in",
    "what follows , the sample of group galaxies will always include _ all _ galaxies in groups with @xmath142 and with two or more members above @xmath143 , regardless of radius or peculiar velocity .",
    "having ensured that the group sample will not be affected by trends at fixed redshift that will complicate comparisons at different redshifts , we now proceed to probe the evolution of the blue fraction with @xmath1 . we divide each of the samples in table  [ tab : samples ] into several independent redshift bins containing equal numbers of galaxies , and we compute @xmath7 in each bin for the group and field galaxy subsamples .",
    "as discussed in   [ sec : fb_errors ] , there may be scatter from bin to bin that exceeds the error estimates , especially at @xmath71 , so to smooth out this effect we also compute @xmath7 in a sliding box whose width is twice the average width of the independent bins in each sample .    the resulting @xmath7 values for each sample are shown in figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] as a function of redshift and of cosmic time ; this figure summarizes the principal results of this paper . as noted previously , there is clearly a significant difference in the blue fractions of group and field populations at @xmath144 .",
    "in addition , in all four samples there is no evidence for evolution in @xmath7 over the range @xmath145 : group and field populations are consistent with constant @xmath7 over this range .",
    "however , the bottom two panels of the figure show that @xmath7 evolves dramatically at @xmath146 , and this evolution is much stronger in groups than it is in the field . in fact , interestingly , the two populations appear to converge in terms of @xmath7 at @xmath5 .",
    "it is also notable that the evolution in samples iii and iv appears to flatten below @xmath2 , in agreement with samples i and ii .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the bins used in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] are broader than those shown in figure  [ fig : colmag ] , so that each bin contains a substantial number of red galaxies ; that is , the convergence of the group and field populations at @xmath5 does not result from small - number statistics .    to further assess the robustness of these results , we have investigated the effects of changing our assumptions about the deep2 redshift incompleteness modeling and the luminosity evolution of the sample . in each panel of figure",
    "[ fig : fb_evol ] , the galaxy weighting scheme used is the `` optimal '' scheme of @xcite , and the magnitude evolution parameter is set to the value found in @xcite , @xmath52 . changing the weighting scheme to either the average or minimal models of  @xcite  or even using no weights whatsoever  effects no qualitative change in the results shown in figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] .",
    "similarly , changing the value of @xmath79 by @xmath147 ( the @xmath148 uncertainty on this parameter from @xcite ) has no qualitative effect on the results .    as a further test",
    ", we also consider the possibility of evolution in the colour of the `` green valley '' separating red and blue galaxies in colour - magnitude space .",
    "if the colour of the valley changes with time , the @xmath7 evolution seen in figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] might simply be the result of passive evolution moving galaxies redward across our ( fixed ) dividing line ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the existence of a bimodality in the galaxy colour distribution suggests that the division between red and blue galaxies should be drawn through the valley , as we have drawn it , rather than being tied to the colours of red galaxies alone .",
    "simple inspection of figure  [ fig : colmag ] shows no clear evidence for evolution in the locus of this valley .",
    "indeed , if one adopts a model in which red galaxies are continuously being formed from blue ones throughout the redshift range of interest ( _ e.g. _ , the `` hybrid '' model proposed by @xcite ) , then one would expect little evolution in the valley s position .",
    "as old red galaxies evolve passively toward redder colours , new red galaxies are formed to take their place , resulting in a red sequence that broadens with time , while the valley between red and blue galaxies remains nearly fixed .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth exploring the effect of allowing the dividing line to evolve .",
    "@xcite showed that the locus of the green valley has evolved redward by at most @xmath149 magnitudes in @xmath150 from @xmath151 to the present day .",
    "we test the effect of this evolution by applying a colour separation which is given by equation  [ eqn : colourcut ] at @xmath151 , with a linear evolution of 0.1 magnitudes redward per unit decrease in redshift ( that is , the blue - red dividing line gets redder with time , as might be expected from passive evolution ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath7 with this evolving cut in sample iv is shown in fig  [ fig : btevol ] .",
    "as shown , the evolving colour separation produces a ( marginally significant ) _ drop _ in the group @xmath7 from @xmath3 to @xmath83 , probably because the green - valley evolution we assume here is too strong .",
    "this is followed by a rise at higher redshifts and a convergence of the group and field values at @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the main results of figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] still hold : there is substantial evolution in @xmath7 in groups at @xmath152 , with a convergence of the group and field @xmath7 values at @xmath5 .    before this result",
    "can be fully accepted , however , there is another systematic effect that should be considered .",
    "it has been observed ( _ e.g _ , @xcite ) that there are two distinct classes of red galaxies at high @xmath1 : nonstar - forming , `` red - and - dead '' early - types and dust - reddened , star - forming late - types .",
    "the latter class will presumably exhibit spectral emission lines ; hence it should be relatively easy to obtain redshifts for these galaxies , even if their spectra have low signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "redshifts may be harder to obtain for the nonstar - forming class , since these exhibit weaker spectral features in general of nonstar - forming galaxies in the sdss exhibit significant [ o ii ] emission from agn activity ; redshifts should be readily obtainable for these galaxies . ] .",
    "it is thus possible that deep2 fails to obtain redshifts preferentially for high - redshift ( _ i.e. _ faint ) early - types .",
    "this would mimic evolution in @xmath7 both in groups and in the field , but if early - type galaxies occur preferentially in groups , this selection effect could potentially also lead to the convergence seen in the group and field @xmath7 values at @xmath5 . in principle , the weighting scheme described in   [ sec : weights ] should approximately correct for this effect ; however , if the situation is so dire that _ all _ galaxies at a given redshift and in a particular region of colour - colour - magnitude space are redshift failures , then the weighting will be of no help .    this potential bias must therefore be taken seriously .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to get some sense of its importance by looking at the _",
    "hst_/acs imaging that the aegis collaboration has obtained in the egs  @xcite .",
    "supposing that the true mix of spheroidal and dusty - spiral red galaxies _ in the field _ is constant with redshift , if early - types are being preferentially missed at high redshift , this would result in a declining ratio of dead to dusty among red field galaxies in deep2 .",
    "we have examined all of the red field galaxies with _ hst _ imaging and confirmed deep2 redshifts in the range @xmath153 in the egs ( a total of 63 galaxies ) .",
    "at all redshifts , roughly @xmath154 of these show no visible evidence for star formation or spiral structure .",
    "hence , it appears that deep2 is _ not _ preferentially failing to obtain redshifts for a particular class of red galaxies at high @xmath1 , although it is worth emphasizing that this conclusion has been drawn from a limited sample of galaxies .",
    "the strong evolution of the deep2 group blue fraction at @xmath152 therefore appears to be robust .",
    "it can be explained either by a blue galaxy population that decreases with time , a red galaxy population that increases with time , or both . as shown in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "there is significant growth in the typical comoving number density @xmath155 of red - sequence galaxies over the redshift range probed by deep2 , while @xmath155 for blue galaxies has remained roughly constant over this range .",
    "hence , it seems reasonable to ascribe the evolution of @xmath7 to the preferential build - up of the red galaxy population in groups .",
    "this conclusion is made manifestly clear in figure  [ fig : bo_numbers ] .",
    "rather than showing fractions , this figure shows the ( incompleteness - weighted ) numbers of galaxies from sample iv in each of the redshift bins shown in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] , both in groups and in the field .",
    "more specifically , the figure shows the total number of galaxies @xmath116 , the number of blue galaxies @xmath115 ( see equation  [ eqn : n_def ] ) , and the number of red galaxies @xmath156 , all as a function of redshift , both in groups and in the field .",
    "it is important to reiterate that the redshift bins were chosen to contain equal _ unweighted _ total numbers of galaxies , so the overall weighted numbers in each bin are not constant . in any case",
    ", we find that the results of this paper are insensitive to the weighting scheme we choose and remain unchanged even if no weights are applied at all .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath116 for groups increases with time , as expected in the hierarchical @xmath12cdm structure - formation paradigm .",
    "but @xmath157 in groups grows at a much faster rate , increasing by almost an order of magnitude from @xmath158 down to @xmath159 . at the same time",
    "@xmath116 in the field stays nearly constant , and @xmath157 in the field increases only modestly ( by a factor of @xmath160 ) over this range .",
    "it seems clear , then , that the build - up of red sequence galaxies over the deep2 redshift range has taken place preferentially within groups and clusters .",
    "the above results so far appear to be robust , but to establish them definitively it is vital that we also test for biases introduced by the group - finding procedure . for example , it is well known ( and has been confirmed here ) that groups and clusters are populated by redder galaxies than the field , but , as shown in figure  [ fig : colmag ] , the deep2 apparent magnitude limit selects strongly against red galaxies at high redshift .",
    "if red galaxies dominate groups and clusters , this effect might cause their richnesses to appear strongly reduced at high redshift  so much so that they might eventually become undetectable with the vdm group - finder .",
    "the high - redshift vdm group sample would then be dominated by false detections .",
    "if this were the case , then the group and field populations identified by the vdm would necessarily be indistinguishable , since they would essentially be random subsamples of the same galaxy population , and so the convergence of the group and field populations seen in figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] would simply be the result of group - finding errors and not of genuine galaxy evolution in groups .",
    "we can test for such an effect by running the vdm group - finder on the deep2 mock catalogues described in ",
    "[ sec : mocks ] . as discussed in that section ,",
    "the mock galaxies are assigned rest - frame @xmath29 colours according to the observed deep2 colour - magnitude - environment in the redshift range @xmath48 .",
    "figure  [ fig : bofoundreal ] shows the evolution of @xmath7 in the mocks for galaxies in _ real _ groups ( _ i.e. _ , galaxies that actually reside in dark matter haloes that contain other galaxies , lower curve ) , for galaxies in _ found _ groups ( i.e. , galaxies in groups identified by the vdm algorithm , diamond points ) , and for the field samples that complement each group sample ( upper curve and triangle points ) . in computing @xmath7 , the same limit in colour - magnitude space",
    "is applied as the one used for sample iv ( given by equation  [ eqn : magcut ] and table  [ tab : samples ] and shown in figure  [ fig : colmag ] ) , and , as in the data , galaxies are included in the group sample only if their host group has two galaxies brigher than the limit .",
    "as figure  [ fig : bofoundreal ] illustrates , the vdm group - finder reduces the separation in @xmath7 between the group and field samples ( as expected , since the found groups are contaminated by interloper field galaxies ) .",
    "however , it does not induce a spurious evolutionary trend in the blue fraction of the found group sample : the slopes of @xmath7 versus @xmath1 are consistent for the real and found samples .",
    "thus it does not appear that the vdm group finder is introducing spurious trends in the measurement of blue fraction evolution .    finally , it is interesting to note in figure  [ fig : bofoundreal ] that the values of @xmath7 for the _ true _ group and field samples in the mocks show clear evolution . as discussed in section  [ sec :",
    "mocks ] , we have not introduced any redshift dependence in the colour - environment relation used to assign colours to mock galaxies . by design , the blue fraction will remain constant with redshift for comparable local density values .",
    "therefore , the evolution of @xmath7 seen in the mocks can only be due to evolution in the _ distribution of local densities _ within the mocks .",
    "that is , the growth of large - scale structure in the mocks causes the number of high - density regions to grow with time , so there are fewer red galaxies at high redshifts in the mocks simply because there are fewer galaxies in overdense environments at high redshifts .",
    "this effect provides a partial explanation for the evolution in @xmath7 observed in deep2 .",
    "however , because the mock group and field samples remain distinguishable in terms of @xmath7 at all redshifts while the observed samples do not , there must also be some decrease in the blue fraction of deep2 group galaxies with time at _ fixed _ overdensity .",
    "( this can also be seen directly in figure  [ fig : bo_numbers ] , where the numbers of red galaxies in groups grow more rapidly than the total group population . )",
    "we will discuss this further in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the main results of this paper are ( 1 ) a significantly lower value of @xmath7 in group versus field populations at @xmath2 ; ( 2 ) a strong increase of @xmath7 in groups with redshift at @xmath152 ; ( 3 ) the _ lack _ of any obvious @xmath7 evolution , for either groups or the field , at lower redshifts ; ( 3 ) a convergence of @xmath7 for the group and field populations at @xmath4 ; ( 5 ) a decline in @xmath7 in richer groups ; and ( 6 ) a negative correlation between @xmath7 and galaxy luminosity , both in groups and in the field . in light of figures  [ fig : fb_evol ] and [ fig : bo_numbers ] , it appears especially clear that the build - up of the deep2 red galaxy population has taken place most dramatically in groups and clusters rather than in the field ( here and throughout , _ field",
    "_ refers to all galaxies not in groups ) .    in interpreting this conclusion ,",
    "three interrelated questions arise .    1 .   what physical mechanisms are acting in groups and clusters to quench star formation and produce the evolution seen in",
    "[ sec : fb_evol ] ?",
    "2 .   is the evolution of @xmath7 in deep2 groups and clusters simply an extension of the similar evolution seen at low redshift_i.e .",
    "_ , is this just the bo effect at high @xmath1 , or are other mechanisms in effect at this epoch ? 3 .",
    "if groups and clusters are the site of red galaxy formation , what is the nature of the red galaxies present in the field , especially those at high redshift ?    by comparing these results to other studies at high and low redshift  and to current theoretical models of galaxy evolution  we can attempt to fit our observations into a coherent picture of star formation and quenching in groups and clusters .      as shown in   [ sec : fb_evol ] , the blue fraction in deep2 groups evolves strongly over the range @xmath161 , and the group and field populations become indistinguishable in terms of @xmath7 at @xmath5 .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with recent work studying the evolution of the high - redshift galaxy population as a function of local galaxy density , both in deep2 and in other surveys . in a companion paper to this one , @xcite show that a correlation exists between galaxy red fraction ( @xmath162 ) and local overdensity out to @xmath163 but that this correlation vanishes at @xmath5 , in close agreement with our findings here .",
    "@xcite used galaxies in the photometric cfht legacy survey to show that the fractions of red and morphologically early - type galaxies grow with time and evolve more strongly in high - density regions than elsewhere .",
    "in addition , @xcite compared photometric observations of two high - redshift clusters to the sdss galaxy population ; they find that the color - density relation has steepened with time and that this steepening is strongest in very overdense regions .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , photometrically determined redshifts are not sufficient for accurate determinations of galaxy density .",
    "also , @xcite consider galaxies above a set of _ fixed _ absolute magnitude limits rather than allowing their limits to evolve as @xmath50 . since galaxies that are faint relative to @xmath50 tend to be bluer than average ( see figure  [ fig : fb_mag ] ) , and because @xmath50 is brighter back in time ,",
    "a fixed cut in @xmath45 includes more faint ( blue ) galaxies at high redshift , which causes @xmath7 to increase ( spuriously ) with z. this selection effect acts to _ enhance _ the observed evolution .    also , @xcite recently considered the fractions of galaxies in various colour ranges as a function of redshift and local density in the vvds redshift survey .",
    "they find that the density dependence of the blue and red fractions vanishes at @xmath164 , a somewhat lower redshift than we find ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "they also find that the blue fraction falls with time at _ all _ densities , in contrast to our finding that @xmath7 is roughly constant in the field at all redshifts .",
    "we see are two possible reasons for this ( minor ) disagreement : first , these authors again consider only a fixed absolute magnitude limit rather than taking @xmath50 evolution into account , and second , as they also caution , their faint , red galaxy sample is incomplete at the highest redshifts they consider , so any evolution of @xmath7 in this range will be spurious . in this paper , we have been careful to design galaxy samples that avoid such subtle selection effects .",
    "we are thus able to confirm that the results from the three papers above @xcite are qualitatively correct despite possibly suffering from such effects .",
    "we have also considered groups versus the field , rather than local density . this will be useful in that it allows our results to be interpreted in terms of the dark matter haloes hosting deep2 galaxies and compared more readily to theory ( see section  [ sec : sams ] ) .",
    "local density remains a powerful tool for studying galaxy populations , however , since it probes a wider range of environments than groups and clusters , allowing one to explore whether galaxy evolution might be driven by processes that occur on scales larger ( or smaller ) than the scale of groups and clusters , or whether _ underdense _ regions are as important to galaxy evolution as overdense regions .",
    "we therefore urge the reader to compare our results to those of @xcite .",
    "in particular , that paper shows that the red fraction of galaxies in overdense regions declines strongly with increasing redshift , while remaining constant in underdense regions , and that the red fractions of these two environments converge at @xmath4 .",
    "this result is strikingly consistent with the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] and stands as confirmation that the results presented in this paper are correct .",
    "both the overdensity considerations of @xcite and the halo - mass considerations of this paper point to a partial answer to the question of which mechanisms are driving the evolution we observe .",
    "as discussed in   [ sec : groupcat ] , deep2 samples intermediate - mass objects ( in the range @xmath165 ) , rather than rich ( @xmath166 ) clusters .",
    "also , @xcite find that the relation between galaxy colour and overdensity is a smooth function of overdensity and does not set in only at the highest densities .",
    "we may thus confidently conclude that the quenching of star formation in groups and clusters can not be ascribed _",
    "solely _ to processes that are significant only in rich clusters , such as ram - pressure stripping and harassment ( similar conclusions have been drawn in lower - redshift studies as well , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .      it is nevertheless tempting to identify the @xmath7 evolution seen in figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] with a simple extension of the bo effect ) . ] to higher redshifts .",
    "it is difficult , however , to square this interpretation with the weak or nonexistent evolution seen over the range @xmath167 . to be sure",
    ", this redshift range might not sample a long enough period of cosmic time to discern evolution due to the bo effect : `` classical '' detections of the bo effect ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) have typically considered clusters over a redshift range @xmath168 , which corresponds to @xmath169 gyr of cosmic time , whereas the range @xmath170 covers only @xmath171 gyr . nevertheless , at minimum , if the evolution observed here is simply the bo effect extended to high - redshift groups , the evolution becomes substantially more rapid at @xmath152 .",
    "moreover , it is not even clear that groups of the sort being considered in this study would be expected to exhibit a strong bo effect at lower redshifts .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : samplehists ] , the vast majority of deep2 groups have velocity dispersions @xmath172 . because most groups also have very few galaxies with spectroscopy ( typically fewer than ten ) ,",
    "there is also a very large scatter ( typically a few hundred @xmath136 ) in the measured dispersions .",
    "coupled with the fact that the number of groups falls very steeply with increasing @xmath89 , this scatter implies that the measured dispersions will tend to be biased high by an eddington - type bias , so that deep2 groups are typically not as massive as their velocity dispersions seem to imply ; this was derived from the known masses of group haloes in the mock catalogues . ] .",
    "also , as discussed above , our mock catalogues imply that deep2 does not sample high - mass clusters .",
    "there have been very few studies of galaxy evolution in the intermediate - mass systems we _ do _ sample , but a recent study by @xcite has shown that the fraction of [ o ii ] emitting galaxies does not evolve significantly out to @xmath173 for groups with @xmath174 .",
    "also , in their study of the morphology - density relation at @xmath2 , @xcite show that galaxies in intermediate - density environments show little morphological evolution down to the @xmath8 epoch studied by @xcite .",
    "if we naively identify intermediate - density environments with intermediate - mass groups like the ones in deep2 , we might also not expect to find significant evolution in @xmath7 over the range @xmath175 .",
    "indeed , preliminary indications ( gerke et al . in prep . )",
    "are that @xmath7 is little different in deep2 groups out to @xmath2 than it is in the groups detected by @xcite in the 2dfgrs , at least for the galaxy population considered in sample i ( but see @xcite ) .    in light of the theoretical basis for the bo effect ,",
    "it is not surprising that the effect would appear weak in the deep2 sample .",
    "as first discussed by @xcite , the bo effect is a natural outcome of hierarchical structure formation so long as cluster environments are efficient at quenching star formation in galaxies .",
    "since clusters form at late times , galaxies in clusters observed at high redshift will have spent less time on average in the cluster environment than their counterparts observed at low redshift .",
    "hence , they will have had less time to feel the effects of the physical mechanisms that are acting to quench star formation .",
    "this picture implies that the bo effect will be weaker in less massive systems , as is observed in , _",
    "@xcite , since smaller systems will typically form earlier and then merge into larger systems , resulting a similarly young galaxy population at all redshifts in these objects .",
    "@xcite considered a set of simple models for the star - formation histories of cluster galaxies , and their results support the basic @xcite scheme : the observed bo effect can be explained by the decreasing accretion rate onto clusters at late times , coupled with a declining star - formation rate in field galaxies .",
    "neither of these studies considered the effect of dark energy on this picture , but it is worth noting that , in the concordance @xmath12cdm cosmology , the universe becomes vacuum dominated around @xmath9 , sharply attenuating matter infall onto clusters at later times .",
    "infall rates should be much higher at the redshifts considered in this paper ; hence one might expect a weaker bo effect in deep2 , since the quenching blue galaxy population in groups and clusters is being steadily replaced by new infalling galaxies .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the evolution seen at @xmath176 in deep2 is different in nature from the low - redshift bo effect .",
    "this is not to say that the physical mechanisms quenching star formation in _ individual galaxies _ are necessarily different at the two epochs ; rather , the evolution may simply be in the _ efficiency _ with which these mechanisms alter the bulk properties of the cluster galaxy population .",
    "in particular , the rapid evolution at @xmath152 and the convergence of the group and field @xmath7 values at @xmath5 suggest a picture in which , at the epochs considered in this paper , groups have only recently become efficient environments for quenching , while the group galaxy population has a similar star - formation rate to the field at earlier times .",
    "for example , if the quenching processes in groups cause star formation to end on a time scale @xmath177 gyr ( which best reproduces the bo effect in @xcite ) , then deep2 groups in this picture would have begun quenching their member galaxies efficiently only 1 gyr prior to the earliest epoch considered here , _",
    "i.e. _ , at a redshift @xmath178 ( for @xmath179 ) .    this basic conclusion ( that the quenching mechanism turns on only at @xmath180 ) is consistent with observations of high star - formation rates in massive galaxies at @xmath6 ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it is supported by the stellar - population study of @xcite , which shows that nonstar - forming galaxies in deep2 at @xmath71 have mean stellar ages of roughly @xmath181 gyr ( indicative of quenching at @xmath180 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover @xcite have shown that a relatively simple model of stellar population evolution , in which star formation is turned off starting at @xmath6 , can explain the build - up of the red sequence from @xmath2 to @xmath182 .",
    "the conclusion that deep2 groups only started quenching their member galaxies at @xmath6 is also nicely consistent with the emerging theoretical picture of galaxy formation ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , in which star formation is quenched efficiently only in haloes with masses above @xmath183 at @xmath180 .",
    "we discuss this last point in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : sams ] below .",
    "it is reasonable to worry , though , that the contamination of the group population by interloper field galaxies might cause the two populations to appear indistinguishable when , in truth , a tiny difference still exists .",
    "certainly figure  [ fig : bofoundreal ] shows that such contamination weakens the observed difference between the two populations ( although it does not induce spurious evolutionary trends ) .",
    "however , the tests on mock catalogues in @xcite show that the sample of deep2 galaxies in vdm groups is dominated by galaxies that are truly in groups , so it should be possible to discern all but the tiniest differences between the samples .",
    "in addition , recall that @xcite find a similar convergence in the _ red _ fraction of galaxies in the most underdense and most overdense environments .",
    "since that study does not suffer from the same contamination effects as the vdm group catalogue , we may be confident that the apparent convergence of the two populations blue fractions can not be ascribed solely to interloper contamination .",
    "it will be instructive to briefly compare the basic picture that the observations in ",
    "[ sec : results ] imply  namely , that groups are not efficient at quenching star formation at @xmath6with the picture that emerges from semi - analytic models ( sams ) of galaxy formation .",
    "this comparison is especially worthwhile because most sams have been designed to reproduce the details of the galaxy population at @xmath182 , so comparisons to the high-@xmath1 deep2 population will provide sharp tests of their correctness .",
    "we will limit ourselves here to qualitative descriptions and arguments , however , and defer detailed comparisons to future work .    in making the comparison",
    ", we will sometimes use as a concrete example the model used by @xcite to populate the millenium run @xcite , a very large , high - resolution n - body simulation of cosmic structure formation .",
    "the elements of this model are qualitatively very similar to other recent sams @xcite , all of which have been successful at reproducing the observed luminosity functions and colour distributions of galaxies at @xmath184 . in the @xcite model , dark matter haloes",
    "are populated with two types of galaxy @xcite : each halo contains one _ central _ galaxy and may also incorporate _ satellite _",
    "galaxies , whose parent haloes merged with the main halo at some time in the past ( this conceptual division of the galaxy population is nearly universal in modern - day sams ) . each halo is also assumed to contain a baryonic component consistent with the overall cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "this gas can fuel ongoing star formation if it cools and is accreted by the halo s central galaxy ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) ; hence , in order to cease star formation and permanently join the red sequence , a galaxy must stop accreting new cold gas onto its disk .",
    "most sams admit two basic routes by which gas accretion can be stopped , associated with the two types of galaxy in the halo . in the case of satellite galaxies , their parent haloes gas is simply added to the gas reservoir of the larger halo when they are accreted .",
    "gas is then only allowed to accrete onto its central galaxy ( which sits at the minimum of the potential well ) , so model satellite galaxies will cease star formation forever once they have exhausted the gas supply in their discs .",
    "all satellite galaxies will thus eventually migrate to the red sequence via strangulation . for central galaxies ,",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated . in all haloes ,",
    "infalling gas is shock - heated to the halo viral temperature , but , in low - mass haloes , that hot gas cools on very short timescales so that accretion onto the central galaxy is very rapid .",
    "star formation never ceases permanently in such galaxies . in more massive haloes ,",
    "the cooling time is longer , and the gas forms a quasi - static , hot halo of gas .",
    "the seperation of haloes into these two regimes  the `` rapid cooling '' and `` static hot halo '' regimes  has a long history ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) ; recent simulations show that the regimes are divided by a rather sharp transition mass of @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "regardless of the halo mass , however , hot gas near the centre can still cool , accrete onto the central object , and form stars , unless some other source of energy is available to stop the cooling ; this is the well - known cooling - flow problem . @xcite propose to solve this problem via heating from low - luminosity agn lurking in the haloes massive central galaxies .",
    "they refer to this heating as `` radio mode '' agn feedback , to distinguish it from winds created by bright agn in the `` quasar mode '' ( which should only temporarily eliminate cold gas from a galaxy ) .",
    "in essence , if the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) is massive enough , its average agn energy output will be sufficient to offset cooling in the halo gas and stanch the flow of gas onto the central galaxy ; this basic idea has also been implemented in other sams @xcite . since halo mass and smbh mass are linked ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , this model effectively predicts a threshold mass above which accretion onto the central galaxy ceases ; then , once the galaxy has exhausted its existing supply of cold gas , star formation ends .    the threshold mass above which `` radio mode '' heating can stop cooling flows is a few times @xmath186 ( @xcite ; croton et al . in prep . ) , roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the typical masses of deep2 groups .",
    "thus , the croton et al .",
    "picture implies that _ all _ galaxies in deep2 groups should eventually be quenched and join the red sequence .",
    "the only group members that will be blue ( i.e. , star - forming or recently star - forming ) in that model will be those that recently fell in to their host group and have not yet exhausted the cold gas in their discs .",
    "if this picture is accurate , then the convergence of @xmath7 for the group and field populations shown in figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] implies that a typical deep2 group member at @xmath73 was _ not _ in a halo above the quenching mass until @xmath177 gyr before that epoch .",
    "this is broadly consistent with hierarchical structure growth in a @xmath12cdm universe . in the millenium run ,",
    "for example , one can trace the history of a typical deep2-group - like halo , with a mass of @xmath187 at @xmath73 . on average ,",
    "such a halo s most massive progenitor at @xmath6 had a mass of @xmath188roughly the mass at which radio - mode heating becomes efficient",
    ". there are @xmath189 gyr of cosmic time between @xmath190 and @xmath73 , a reasonable timescale for quenching and migration to the red sequence .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this explanation is conceptually quite different than the bo effect : as we have used the phrase in this paper , the bo effect is simply a _ consequence _ of the assumption that groups and clusters quench star formation ( and thus it affects only infalling satellites ) whereas the mechanism described here is the _ onset _ of quenching in group - size haloes ( which affects _ central _ galaxies as well ) evolution seen in figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] appears to _ flatten _ at @xmath191 , so for the red sequence to continue its build - up , there must be an increase in the number density of groups .",
    "that is , the growth of the red galaxy population at @xmath191 might still be attributable solely to the hierarchical growth of structure . ] .",
    "as we have seen , evolutionary results fit nicely , in a broad sense , with the current semi - analytic picture of galaxy formation . however , there are some difficulties in detail , especially as regards satellite galaxies .",
    "satellites in the model are unable to accrete new gas ; such accretion is reserved for central galaxies , _ regardless _ of the parent - halo mass . under these assumptions",
    ", groups at @xmath5 should have a lower blue fraction than the field , unless _ all _ of their galaxies were isolated at @xmath192 . since this seems unlikely",
    ", it may be necessary to revise the assumption that _ all _ satellites are stripped of their halo gas with equal efficiency , regardless of host - halo mass . indeed , there is already significant evidence that this is an oversimplification .",
    "the @xcite model significantly over - predicts the abundance of faint red galaxies ( see their figure 11 ) .",
    "also , there is evidence that a satellite galaxy s colour is correlated with the colour of its central galaxy @xcite ; this would not occur if all satellites were stripped of their gas with equal efficiency .",
    "most recently , @xcite showed that the croton et al .",
    "model severely underpredicts the blue fraction of sdss satellites and argued that the efficiency with which gas is stripped from satellite galaxies must scale with the mass of the host halo .",
    "we note in passing that such a revision to the model would also account naturally for the correlation seen in figure  [ fig : fb_cuts ] between @xmath7 and group richness , since more massive groups would quench star formation more efficiently .",
    "we close this section by commenting on the continued presence of a significant red galaxy population in the field at high redshift , even when the group and field blue fractions have converged .",
    "one of our main conclusions in this work is that groups are the primary locus of quenching and red - galaxy formation , and the most naive interpretation of this statement would suggest that there should be _ no _ red galaxies in the field .",
    "this is an oversimplification , of course , not only because isolated ellipticals are known to exist locally ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , but also since the red sequence will be contaminated by some fraction of dusty star - forming galaxies ( _ e.g. _ @xcite )",
    ". one might also expect such galaxies to be more common at high redshift , when the average star - formation rate of the universe was higher .",
    "it should therefore come as no surprise that deep2 contains a non - negligible population of red field galaxies at all @xmath1 , but it is not immediately clear whether dusty star - formers can account for all such galaxies .    to address this issue , we make use of the _ hst_/acs imaging that has been obtained for a portion the extended groth strip subregion of the deep2 survey  @xcite . in this region",
    "there are eleven red field galaxies in the redshift range @xmath193 .",
    "five of these show spiral structure or other visible evidence of star - forming activity , while six appear to be nonstar - forming spheroidal or lenticular objects .",
    "thus it appears that a significant population of early - type field galaxies remains at these redshifts ; the red field population observed in deep2 can not be fully accounted for by dusty star - formers .",
    "the issue is further complicated by group - finding errors .",
    "the vdm group - finder fails to identify some fraction of group members ; these will appear in the field sample , and some of them will be early - types .",
    "however , the statistics given in  @xcite imply that only @xmath194 of the field galaxies identified in sample iv are actually group members ( not the value of @xmath39 quoted in   [ sec : groupcat ] , since we reclassified a significant number of group galaxies as field galaxies in   [ sec : selection ] ) . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : samples ] , @xmath195 of these  or @xmath196 of the total field sample  will be red .",
    "combining this with the observed fraction of dusty star - formers still does not account for the full population of red field galaxies ( about @xmath197 of the field in sample iv ) .",
    "it is therefore worth considering a few mechanisms by which _ bona fide _ early - type galaxies could enter the field population . here",
    "the distinction between central and satellite galaxies will again be useful .",
    "the threshold mass for quenching in _ central _ galaxies , a few times @xmath186 , is somewhat lower than the mass range of groups considered in this study ; therefore , there should be a population of quenched central galaxies that do not have satellites that enter the deep2 sample ; these would appear as red galaxies in the field .",
    "this picture naturally leads to the correlation between @xmath7 and limiting magnitude seen in figure  [ fig : fb_mag ] .",
    "the strength of this correlation appears to be the same both in groups and in the field .",
    "but if all galaxies above a given mass are quenched , and if halo mass correlates roughly with luminosity , then brighter subsets of the galaxy population will naturally have lower blue fractions , both in groups and in the field .",
    "this explanation also fits nicely with the recent results of  @xcite , who show that the brightest galaxies mass - to - light ratios have grown dramatically between @xmath151 and the present day while @xmath198 has remained roughly constant for fainter galaxies  presumably because the brightest galaxies have ceased star formation but continue to accrete new , non - luminous mass .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that winds from merger - driven quasar activity may expel cold gas from galactic disks @xcite .",
    "if such a wind arises in a galaxy whose halo is less massive than the threshold at which `` radio - mode '' agn feedback is important , then the galaxy should eventually reincorporate some of the expelled gas and resume star formation .",
    "but if the timescale for reincorporation is longer than the lifetime of hot , blue stars ( @xmath199 gyr ) , then such galaxies will temporarily join the red sequence .",
    "such temporarily red galaxies could also account for some red field objects .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the blue fraction in the field appears to evolve at @xmath176 , if less strongly than in groups .",
    "this can be seen in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] : @xmath7 in the field changes by @xmath200 between @xmath83 and @xmath73 , while the group value changes by @xmath149 .",
    "it is worth exploring whether this effect is real , or whether it can simply be attributed to contamination of the field sample by group galaxies , arising from group - finding errors .",
    "let us assume , to start , that the _ true _ blue fraction in the field is constant with @xmath1 .",
    "then , if the field sample contains a fraction @xmath201 of contaminating group galaxies , and the group sample similarly has a contamination fraction @xmath202 of field galaxies , it is straightforward to show that , for a given observed change @xmath203 in the group blue fraction , the observed change in the field blue fraction is @xmath204 for sample iv , the success statistics given in @xcite imply that @xmath205 and @xmath206 ( as discussed earlier in this section ) .",
    "thus , the observed change in the field blue fraction should be @xmath207% of the observed change in the group blue fraction .",
    "this ratio is , in fact , marginally consistent with the error bars in figure  [ fig : fb_evol ] .",
    "hence , the observed decline in the field blue fraction with time is largely caused by contamination by misclassified group galaxies .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the findings of @xcite , who observe no evolution in the red fraction of galaxies in the most underdense environments .",
    "on the basis of the present study alone , however , it remains possible that there is also some small amount of intrinsic evolution in the field population .",
    "such evolution would not be too surprising : since the characteristic halo mass @xmath50 does not reach the quenching mass of a few times @xmath208 until @xmath2 ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , the number density of quenched central galaxies in the field will be growing relatively rapidly at earlier times .",
    "regardless , it remains clear from figures  [ fig : fb_evol ] and [ fig : bo_numbers ] that the build - up of the red sequence in deep2 takes place preferentially in groups .",
    "we have used the deep2 group catalogue of @xcite to study the blue fraction of galaxies in groups and the field at @xmath2 . after creating four samples that are carefully designed to be free from colour - dependent and redshift - dependent selection effects , we probe the dependence of @xmath7 on a galaxy s environment ( group or field ) , on galaxy luminosity , on group properties , and on redshift .    first , over the redshift range @xmath209",
    ", there is a significant difference in @xmath7 between the deep2 group and field populations , with a substantially lower @xmath7 in groups than in the field .",
    "the well - known colour segregation observed between nearby group and field galaxy populations is thus already in place at @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , there is a negative correlation between @xmath7 and group richness over this redshift range , echoing local correlations between galaxy colour and various proxies for halo mass .",
    "a trend also exists at these redshifts between @xmath7 and the luminosity of the galaxies being considered , with fainter galaxies being more likely to be blue ; the strength of this trend does not appear to depend on whether those galaxies are in groups or the field .",
    "no siginificant evolution in @xmath7 occurs in the deep2 group or field galaxy populations over the range @xmath210 ; however , at @xmath176 , there is dramatic , statistically significant evolution in the group population , with @xmath7 rising rapidly as @xmath1 increases .",
    "most notably , the value of @xmath7 in groups becomes indistinguishable from the field value at @xmath5 . to assess the robustness of these results , we have constructed mock catalogues that replicate the colour - environment correlations in the deep2 data .",
    "tests with these mock catalogues indicate that the evolution and convergence are not artifacts of the group - finding algorithm . moreover , these tests suggest that the observed evolution can be explained partially  but not entirely  by evolution in the distribution of galaxy environments , _",
    "i.e. _ by the growth of large - scale structure , coupled with the known correlation between environment and galaxy properties . however , to explain the strong evolution and convergence , some further mechanism is required .    because the @xmath7 evolution appears to weaken at @xmath191",
    ", we conclude that it is different in nature from the classical bo effect , in which @xmath7 in clusters rises dramatically from @xmath211 out to @xmath8 . indeed , the bo effect is a natural outcome of hierarchical structure formation , _ provided that _ groups and clusters are already efficient at quenching star formation in the galaxies that fall into them .",
    "but there is a _ convergence _ between @xmath7 values in groups and in the field at @xmath5 , which implies that deep2 groups were , at some epoch , _ not _ especially efficient at quenching infalling galaxies . in particular ,",
    "if it takes @xmath199 gyr for a quenched galaxy to join the red sequence , our results indicate that the groups in this study only became suitable environments for quenching at @xmath6 .",
    "this conclusion is broadly consistent with current semi - analytic models of galaxy formation @xcite . in those models , the central galaxies of dark matter haloes",
    "are quenched when low - level agn feedback becomes strong enough to stop gas in the halo from cooling and condensing onto the galaxy to form stars ; this process becomes efficient at a threshold halo mass of a few times @xmath186 ( @xcite ; croton et al in prep . ) .",
    "our mock catalogues imply that the groups observed in deep2 have masses in the range @xmath212 .",
    "a typical halo in this mass range at @xmath5 will drop below the threshold mass for quenching @xmath213 gyr earlier , at @xmath6 .",
    "this is a potential explanation for the convergence in the group and field @xmath7 values at @xmath5 .",
    "present - day sams may have difficulty explaining these observations in detail , however , particularly because they universally assume that _ satellite _ galaxies are quenched in all haloes regardless of mass or redshift . in the future , it will be worthwhile to make detailed comparisons between our observations and the precise predictions of sams , in order to refine the physical description of galaxy formation that they provide .",

    "<S> we explore the behavior of the blue galaxy fraction over the redshift range @xmath0 in the deep2 survey , both for field galaxies and for galaxies in groups . </S>",

    "<S> we develop four such samples for this study : at all redshifts considered , each one is complete in colour - magnitude space , and the selection also accounts for evolution in the galaxy luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> these samples will also be useful for future evolutionary studies in deep2 . </S>",
    "<S> the colour segregation observed between local group and field samples is already in place at @xmath2 : deep2 groups have a significantly lower blue fraction than the field . at fixed @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> there is also a correlation between blue fraction and galaxy magnitude , such that brighter galaxies are more likely to be red , both in groups and in the field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there is a negative correlation between blue fraction and group richness . in terms of evolution , </S>",
    "<S> the blue fraction in groups and the field remains roughly constant from @xmath3 to @xmath2 , but beyond this redshift the blue fraction in groups rises rapidly with @xmath1 , and the group and field blue fractions become indistinguishable at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> careful tests indicate that this effect does not arise from known systematic or selection effects . </S>",
    "<S> to further ensure the robustness of this result , we build on previous mock deep2 catalogues to develop mock catalogues that reproduce the colour - overdensity relation observed in deep2 and use these to test our methods . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence between the group and field blue fractions at @xmath5 implies that deep2 galaxy groups only became efficient at quenching star formation at @xmath6 ; this result is broadly consistent with other recent observations and with current models of galaxy evolution and hierarchical structure growth .    </S>",
