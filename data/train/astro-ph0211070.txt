    "the luminosity function ( lf ) of point x - ray sources can provide useful information about galactic stellar populations . _ chandra _ s good angular resolution allows detailed x - ray source population studies of external galaxies . because m31 is close ( @xmath0 kpc ; stanek & garnavich 1998 ; macri et al .",

    "m31 is therefore an excellent extragalactic spiral galaxy in which to study x - ray source populations with a wide range of luminosities .",

    "1997 ] , _ xmm - newton _  [ shirey et al . 2001 ] and _ chandra _  [ kong et al . 2002a ; kaaret 2002 ] ) have concentrated on the central region ( @xmath3 ) . in particular , kong et al .",
    "( 2002a ) found that the shape of lf varies with radius even in the central @xmath4 region .",
    "more recently , trudolyubov et al . (",
    "2002 ) used _ xmm - newton _  to study the lf of the northern disk , and found it to differ from that of the central region , suggesting a different source population .",
    "in this paper , we present the lfs of three m31 disk regions as observed by _",
    "chandra_. we compare them to lfs of the central region ( kong et al .",
    "2002a ) and of globular clusters ( gcs ;",
    "distefano et al .",
    "we find that the slopes of the lfs are of limited use in relating x - ray source populations to stellar populations .",
    "we therefore include in our study other quantities derived from the x - ray data ( e.g. , source densities , and average and maximum luminosities ) as well as optical tracers of the stellar population .",
    "figure 1 shows the fields - of - view of the _ chandra _  acis - s observations of m31 .",
    "three disk regions of m31 were chosen to span a wide range of m31 stellar populations ; each was observed @xmath5 times ( @xmath6 ksec for each acis - s observation ) at intervals of @xmath7 months during 2000 - 2001 ( pi : distefano ) .",
    "a detailed description of the observations will be presented in a companion paper .",

    "there are 12 gc x - ray sources in fields 1 , 2a and 3a+3b .    for each observation",
    ", we examined the background and rejected all high background intervals .",
    "only events with photon energies in the range of 0.37 kev were included in our analysis .",
    "the three observations in each field were merged . to detect sources we used ciao task wavdetect ( freeman et al .",
    "source count rates were determined via aperture photometry and were corrected for effective exposure and vignetting .",
    "the radius of the aperture was varied with the average off - axis angle to match the 90% encircled energy function .",
    "background was extracted from an annulus centered on each source . every extraction region was examined carefully in the images , and in some cases , we had to modify the extraction region to avoid nearby sources .",
    "sources clearly associated with m32 are excluded from this analysis .",
    "obvious foreground stars ( see distefano et al .",
    "2002b for details ) were excluded .",
    "the total number of sources detected in field 1 , 2 and 3 is 53 , 99 and 65 respectively .",
    "detailed source lists and source properties of all the sources in our fields will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
    "the background subtracted count rates were converted to luminosities by assuming an absorbed power - law energy spectrum with photon index 1.7 , column density @xmath12 @xmath13 and a distance of 780 kpc .",
    "this model is consistent with previous _ xmm - newton _  ( shirey et al . 2001 ) and _ chandra _  ( kong et al .",
    "2002a ) observations , in which the spectra of many bright point sources could be well fit by similar models . although this type of spectral model does not apply to certain classes of sources , such as supersoft sources ( distefano & kong , in preparation ) and supernova remnants ( e.g. , kong et al .",
    "2002b ) , the number of such sources in our data sets is small .",
    "in general , the luminosities derived by choosing different spectral models ( e.g. , thermal bremsstrahlung ) would differ from the ones we derive by less than a factor of @xmath14 , except for supersoft sources . considering only power - law spectral models and varying the photon index from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , and sampling values of @xmath17 from @xmath18 @xmath13 to @xmath19 @xmath13",

    "we estimated the contribution of background objects by using number counts from the _ chandra _  deep field survey ( e.g. , brandt et al . 2001 ; giacconi et al .",

    "the slope steepens when we include background effects , from 1.7 to 3.6 , suggesting that the lf of field 1 listed in table 1 is very likely a lower limit .",
    "we have two goals . ( 1 ) to relate the x - ray properties of point sources in each group ( fields 1 , 2 , 3 , the gcs , and the central region ) to properties ( such as age ) of the underlying stellar population .",
    "( 2 ) to understand what the results imply for x - ray observations of distant galaxies that may be similar to m31 .",
    "we begin by counting the number of optically identified ob associations ( magnier et al .",
    "1993 ) , supernova remnants ( snrs ; dodorico et al . 1980 ; braun & walterbos 1993 ; magnier et al . 1995 ) , planetary nebulae ( pn ; ford & jacoby 1978 ; ciardullo et al .",
    "1989 ; ciardullo , private communication ) and gcs ( battistini et al . 1987 ; magnier 1993 ; barmby & huchra 2001 ) in each of the three fields .",
    "although these catalogs may not be complete and certainly suffer from a variety of selection effects , they do provide a gross indication of the stellar populations inhabiting each field .",
    "table 2 summarizes the results .",
    "we now proposed to study the x - ray properties of each field and relate them to the stellar populations that inhabit the field . because each field was the subject of identical x - ray observations ,",
    "comparisons of x - ray properties across fields are well - defined .",
    "the situation is not as straightforward for optical observations .",
    "all of our @xmath5 fields were surveyed for gcs ( battistini et al .",
    "1987 ; magnier 1993 ; barmby & huchra 2001 ) and pn ( ford & jacoby 1978 ; ciardullo et al .",
    "1989 ; ciardullo , private communication ) the entire galaxy was also surveyed by iso far - infrared ( 175@xmath61 m ) observations ( schmidtobreick , haas , & lemke 2000 ) .",
    "data is also available for optically - identified ob associations ( magnier et al .",
    "1993 ) and for supernova remnants ( snrs ; dodorico et al . 1980",
    "; braun & walterbos 1993 ; magnier et al . 1995 ) .",
    "field 2 , which is closest to the galaxy center , was fully covered by each of these surveys , but only roughly half of field 1 , and 20% of field 3 , as described below , were covered .",
    "* field 1 :  * field 1 is in the far southwestern end of the disk , @xmath62 or 16 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "since all fields received identical x - ray coverage , we can say that the spatial density of x - ray sources in field 1 is lower than in the other fields , the slope of the lf is steeper , and the maximum point - source x - ray luminosity is smaller .",
    "in fact , the population is dominated by faint x - ray sources ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the only optical counterparts we found are 4 possible foreground stars ( distefano et al .",
    "two far - infrared knots are located in the north - east corner of the field ( schmidtobreick , haas , & lemke 2000 ) , which might hint at the presence of a young population in this portion of the field .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of a clump of 10 snrs near the far - infrared knots .",
    "these @xmath64 snrs were discovered by magnier et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in a survey that covered approximately half of field 1 .",
    "no additional field 1 snrs were found in that survey , in spite of the fact the area of field 1 that was surveyed was @xmath65 times larger than the region defined by the snr clump .",
    "in addition , no ob associations were found in field 1 ( magnier 1993 ) , although only roughly half of the field was surveyed .",
    "one additional snr was discovered in field 1 ( dodorico 1980 ) in a photographic survey .",
    "the combination of these data indicate that only a small portion of the northern half of field 1 contains a young stellar population .",
    "this implies that roughly half of the field 1 x - ray sources lie in regions not associated with young stellar populations .",
    "apart from the absence of far - infrared knots in the southern portion of field 1 , we have no clear indication about the presence or absence of snrs or ob associations .",
    "we therefore refer to the integrated optical light . according to walterbos & kennicutt ( 1988 ) ,",
    "the total integrated @xmath66 magnitude is roughly @xmath67 magnitudes dimmer at the location of field 1 than near the galaxy center , and the values of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , show that this region is clearly redder than the central region .",
    "this trend is supported by other investigations ( see hodge & kennicutt 1982 , and references in hodge 1992 ) .",
    "on the basis of this continuum light , it would be surprising if the southern half of field 1 housed a large young population of stars .",
    "we note further , that , for the total numbers of snrs and ob associations in field 1 to be comparable to that in fields 2 or 3a , their local density in the southern half of field 1 would have to be larger than their density even in field 2 .",

    "2000 ) that are coincident with the x - ray sources in field 2 .",
    "the density of cataloged optical sources is highest ; more than 80 optical sources are snrs or ob associations , indicating a significant presence of young stars .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the x - ray properties of at least a portion of the population in field 2 is characteristic of young stellar populations .",
    "* field 3 :  * in terms of its distance from the nucleus , the x - ray properties of its point sources , and the numbers and types of optical sources , field 3 lies between fields 1 and 2 .",
    "the slope of the lf of field 3 is determined almost entirely by sources outside the star - forming ring ( field 3b ) .",
    "in fact , the inclusion or exclusion of the sources from field 3a ( the section near the star forming ring ) does not significantly affect the fit , since only 5 sources ( above @xmath23 ) belong to field 3a .",
    "field 3a was well - covered by the surveys for snr and ob associations , and visual examination of the optical fields ( magnier et al .",
    "1995 ) demonstrates that these objects are highly concentrated in the star - formation ring .",
    "the region adjacent to the ring was also covered by the surveys .",
    "we therefore know that there is a sharp spatial cut - off in the distribution of snrs and ob associations , with no indication of them away from the ring .",
    "there is , therefore , no sign that the regions not surveyed for snrs and ob associations are rich with these objects .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the distribution of far - infrared knots : there are @xmath5 such knots , and , although the entire field was searched , all @xmath5 are located along the star - forming ring .",
    "the total integrated @xmath66 magnitude is roughly @xmath5 magnitudes dimmer at the location of field 1 than near the galaxy center ( walterbos & kennicutt 1988 ) , and , as for field 1 , the values of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , show that the region is redder than the central region ( see also hodge & kennicutt 1982 ) it therefore seems unlikely that field 3b houses a large young population .",
    "it is perhaps puzzling that the slope of field 3 s lf is essentially the same as for field 2 ( within the uncertainty limits ) , but is less steep than 1 .    * gcs :  * the lf of gcs differs from that of all three disk fields and the central region .",

    "it is worth noting that the luminosity break is also near the luminosity of the brightest gc in our galaxy ( see distefano et al .",

    "2002a ; kaaret 2002 ) , there is a luminosity break at @xmath82 .",
    "this break might represent an aging x - ray binaries population ( wu 2001 ; kilgard et al .",

    "we fit the differential lf with two power - law models with a break at @xmath83  and the results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the shape of the integrated lf differs from that of the central region , as fields 1 , 2a and 3 have less luminous sources ( @xmath84 ) and have relatively steep slopes for the lf .",
    "the slope of the integrated lf below @xmath81  is therefore steeper than that of the bulge region ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the slope of the integrated lf above the break is consistent with that of gcs , suggesting that luminous x - ray sources of m31 are dominated by gcs .",
    "we also fit the differential lf with a cutoff power - law model ( @xmath85 ; grimm et al .",
    "2002 and trudolyubov et al .",
    "the best - fitting slope ( @xmath27 ) and cutoff luminosity , @xmath86 , are 0.49 and @xmath87 , respectively . compared to the central @xmath4 region ,",
    "the slope is steeper while the cutoff luminosity is roughly the same ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the cutoff power - law fit to the central @xmath4 region is in good agreement with the central @xmath88 observed with _ xmm - newton _  ( trudolyubov et al .",
    "the best fit parameters of the integrated lf are consistent with the lf of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in our own galaxy ( grimm et al . 2002 ) , which could indicate that lmxbs are important components of m31 s x - ray population .",
    "with the large number of x - ray sources in each of several different stellar environments , it is appropriate to look for patterns that may relate the lf of each region to its stellar properties . developing such a relationship could be useful in the study of more distant galaxies in which the x - ray sources and/or the stellar environments are not as well resolved as in m31 .",
    "judging by the numbers and types of optical sources in fields 1 , 3 , and 2 , it seems as if there is a progression from an old population ( 1 ) , to another old population which adjoins a region of star formation ( 3 ) , to the very mixed population near the galaxy center , which includes a significant sub - population of young stars ( 2 ) .",
    "the x - ray properties also seem to exhibit a progression .",
    "the slope of the lf is steepest in field 1 , and less steep in fields 2 and 3 .",
    "the density of x - ray sources increases from field 1 , to field 3 , and is highest in field 2 . the value of the maximum source luminosity increases as well .    in spite of these apparent trends , it is wise to be cautious , as there are also some apparent discrepancies when we make comparisons with complementary data sets .",
    "we first consider acis - i observations of the galaxy center , which have also been used to construct lfs ( kong et al .",
    "the two inner regions , r1 and r2 encompass @xmath89 around the galaxy center ; together they include 92 point sources .",
    "the lfs in these 2 regions are similar ; the composite has slope @xmath90 above the luminosity break ( see kong et al .",
    "that this is obviously comparable to the slope of field 2a s lf , since 2a and ( r1 + r2 ) are close to each other .",
    "the puzzle is that r3 , which covers the central @xmath91 ( excluding r1+r2 ) , and includes @xmath92 point sources , has a markedly different slope , @xmath41 , much closer to the slope of field 1 .",
    "a second relevant comparison can be made with _",
    "xmm - newton_observations of the northern disk ( north1 + north2 ; figure 1 ; trudolyubov et al .",
    "the lf also has a slope ( @xmath93 ) intermediate between that of field 1 and field 3b . yet , judging by the location of ob associations and snrs ( see figure 1 ) , the stellar population would appear likely to have much in common with field 3a and perhaps field 2 . indeed , by comparing with our galaxy ( grimm et al .",
    "2002 ) , trudolyubov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) concluded that the northern disk of m31 is dominated by faint and young high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "it is worth noting that grimm et al .",
    "( 2002 ) derived a slope of @xmath94 for the cumulative lf of hmxbs in our galaxy , which is significantly flatter than that of the _ xmm - newton _  northern disk fields . in constrast ,",
    "the lf of field 2a is closer to the galactic hmxb population ( but note that there are uncertainties due to the differences in energy coverage of _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _  and _ rxte_/asm and other instrumental effects ) .",
    "these examples make it clear that the slope , taken by itself , is not a good indication of the age of the underlying stellar population , and hence of the age and character of the x - ray sources . yet , while the slopes of lfs for dissimilar stellar populations may be the same , other qualities ( e.g. , average and maximum luminosities , and source densities ) differ , and these combined with information about x - ray colors ( prestwich et al .",
    "2002 ) may break the degeneracy .",
    "the data on m31 s gcs demonstrate two things .",
    "first , there is an important difference between a subset of the x - ray gcs in m31 and the x - ray gcs in the galaxy .",
    "in fact all of the m31 gc sources above the high - luminosity break are more luminous than any galactic gc x - ray source ; i.e. , this part of the m31 gc luminosity function has no galactic analog .",
    "it has been argued on the basis of binary evolution , that these high-@xmath95 sources may be a signal that a subset of m31 s gcs may be younger than galactic gcs ( di stefano et al .",
    "the possible future evolution of the lf toward lower luminosities may also support this interpretation .",
    "second , if the shape of the lf is a reliable guide , there is an important difference between m31 s x - ray sources in gcs and the x - ray sources in both the central field and the disk .",
    "if a significant portion of non - gc sources are objects that were once ejected from gcs , it will be necessary to determine how the gc lf can evolve into either the lf of sources in the central field ( where most of the gcs reside ) or into the lfs found for disk sources .",
    "the integrated lf makes it clear that observers in distant galaxies would not find m31 to be a very impressive x - ray galaxy .",
    "if observers in the virgo cluster were to observe m31 with the equivalent of a 40 ksec acis - s observations , only a handful ( 4 ) of sources ( those with @xmath77 @xmath96 ) would be visible at any given time .",
    "half of these would be near the center of the galaxy ; the remaining sources would be in gcs .",
    "field 1 would have no detectable sources ; field 3a would be , at best , sparsely populated .",
    "this result is consistent with earlier surveys ( supper et al .",
    "1997,2001 ) and with _ xmm - newton _  data ( shirey et al .",
    "2001 ; trudolyubov et al .",
    "although our own galaxy may house a somewhat larger number of sources with @xmath77 @xmath96(grimm et al . 2002 ) , the basic result holds for our galaxy as well , with the difference that it is likely that none of the detectable sources would be in gcs .",
    "this result makes it clear that the galaxy we live in and its nearest neighbor are very different from the distant galaxies on which many current x - ray studies concentrate .",
    "we are grateful to paul green and the champ collaboration ( see http://hea-www.harvard.edu/champ/ ) for providing blank field data , and phil kaaret for discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa under go1 - 2091x , nag5 - 10889 and nag5 - 10705 ."
