    "schwinger pair production by temporally or spatially inhomogeneous electric fields has been a theoretically and experimentally interesting and challenging issue .",
    "the minkowski or dirac vacuum under the influence of a strong electric field becomes unstable and emits electron - positron or charged particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "the possibility of directly measuring electron - positron pairs by strong laser sources such as extreme light infrastructure ( eli ) has recently boosted intensive researches on pair production by pulsed electric fields @xcite ( for review and references , see also refs.@xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to vacuum polarization , pair production has been studied for various electromagnetic configurations , for which many analytical approximation schemes have been elaborated @xcite .",
    "the keldysh approach @xcite ( review and references , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the worldline instanton method @xcite and the phase - integral or wkb method @xcite , to list a few , have been widely used as analytical approximation schemes .",
    "the two typical methods employed to numerically compute the pair - production rate in time - dependent electric fields are the kinetic approach @xcite and the wigner formalism @xcite . the quantum vlasov equation has been often used for numerical calculation of pair production with or without back - reaction included @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to employ the evolution operator formalism for numerical computation of pair production by pulsed electric fields of various configurations in scalar qed .",
    "the stratagem is to express the hamiltonian in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of the minkowski vacuum and then find the evolution operator satisfying the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian for a spinless charged boson in a time - dependent electric field in the momentum space consists of infinite number of oscillators with time - dependent frequencies and each oscillator can have the evolution operator represented in @xmath0 algebra .",
    "we then choose the number operator , the one - pair creation operator and the one - pair annihilation operator in the minkowski vacuum as the generators for the evolution operator @xmath1    in quantum optics the evolution operator for a time - dependent oscillator has been studied in a different representation of @xmath0 @xcite . the oscillator representation or the creation and",
    "annihilation operator representation has also been used to derive the quantum vlasov equation for pair production @xcite .",
    "the difference of this paper from other earlier works is that we find the evolution operator by directly solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation , then find the exact quantum state evolved from the minkowski vacuum , and finally compute the number of pairs during the whole evolution in pulsed electric fields .",
    "the evolution operator represented by the creation and annihilation operators has an additional advantage of expressing the exact quantum state as the squeezed vacuum of multi - pairs of particle and antiparticle under the influence of the pulsed electric fields .",
    "further it provides a good measure for counting the number of minkowski particle and antiparticle pairs .    to study pair production from nontrivial configurations of electromagnetic field",
    ", we shall consider only pulsed electric fields , simplified model fields , which act for a finite duration but is uniform over the space .",
    "thus the minkowski vacuum excites into multi - particle and antiparticle state during the interaction of the electric field and finally settles down in some nontrivial vacuum state and , in an exceptional case , returns to the minkowski vacuum .",
    "the pulsed electric fields to be studied are classified into the mono - polarity type and the di - polarity type . in the first class we consider ( i ) @xmath2 ,",
    "( ii ) @xmath3 , ( iii ) @xmath4 , and in the second class we also consider ( iv ) @xmath5 , ( v ) @xmath6 , ( vi ) @xmath7 .    the electric fields ( i)-(vi ) provides a good arena to discuss some fundamental questions , not to mention possible applications to ultra - strong lasers .",
    "the electric fields ( i)-(iii ) of mono - polarity type necessarily lead to non - zero gauge potential values , in which the adiabatic basis differs from the minkowski one .",
    "then a question may be raised whether pairs produced by electric pulses are the minkowski ones or the adiabatic ones @xcite . and the oscillation of the number of pairs after the completion of electric pulses may be another interesting question since the kinetic approach using the adiabatic basis predicts non - oscillating pair production while the nonadiabatic method predicts oscillating pair production for general electric fields except for the solitonic gauge field @xcite .",
    "the evolution operator provides asymptotic solutions in the remote future for all pulsed electric fields including ( i)-(vi ) , according to which the number of pairs converges to a momentum - dependent constant when the gauge potentials vanish or oscillates around a momentum - dependent time - averaged constant when the gauge potentials have nonzero constant .",
    "another interesting issue is the structure of the longitudinal momentum spectrum of pairs discovered by hebenstreit et al in a sinusoidal field with gaussian envelope @xcite .",
    "dumlu and dunne explained the substructure of the spectrum in the inverse square gauge potential by the stokes phenomenon , in which more than two pairs of complex turning points for the fourier mode equation contribute either in phase or out of phase to the wkb instanton action @xcite .",
    "the analytical approximation schemes such as the keldysh approach or the wkb or phase - integral method without stokes phenomenon can not explain the substructure of the longitudinal momentum distribution . the evolution operator formalism is efficient enough to compute the longitudinal momentum distribution of produced pairs in the pulsed electric fields ( i)-(vi ) and confirms the substructure of the spectrum for the critical field strength and compton time scale .",
    "the spectra for ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iv ) and ( v ) exhibit rich structures but those for ( iii ) and ( vi ) have relatively simple structure . bunching of spectrum in the field ( iii ) is observed around one positive and one negative momentum with the same magnitude .",
    "further the polarity of the electric field ( iv ) leads to negative momentum dominance or positive momentum dominance in the spectrum .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the evolution operator in algebraic form for scalar qed in a pulsed electric field and express the vacuum polarization in terms of the complex parameters for the evolution operator . and",
    "we express the number of pairs by the imaginary part of the parameter for the number operator . in sec .",
    "iii , by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation , we derive a set of first order differential equations for three complex parameters for the evolution operator .",
    "and we find the asymptotic solutions for the pulsed electric fields whose gauge potentials approach either zero or nonzero constant after the completion of the interaction . in sec .",
    "iv we give an intuitive interpretation of pair production by pulsed electric fields from the analogy with quantum mechanics . in sec .",
    "v , we numerically investigate pair production by several configurations of electric fields , some of which have recently been studied in literature . in sec .",
    "vi , we discuss the physical implications of the results and conclude the paper .",

    "is plotted for for the solitonic gauge potential with @xmath180 [ left panel ] and for non - solitonic gauge potential with @xmath181 [ right panel].,title=\"fig : \" ]    for the numerical purpose , we consider the electric field with the center shifted @xmath182 and set @xmath159 but select a natural number and non - natural number for the strength @xmath183 .",
    "the left panel of fig.[soliton - f ] is the number of pairs as a function of time for the solitonic gauge potentials @xmath184 and @xmath161 .",
    "the number of pairs increases and then decreases in symmetric way around the center @xmath139 of the gauge potential and the number of local maxima is the same as the soliton number @xcite . on the other hand , for a non - natural number , for instance , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , the number of produced pairs increases from zero but decreases to a constant value .",
    "this temporal behavior of the number of pairs is expected from the asymptotic solutions ( [ asym sol1 ] ) for @xmath187 regardless of @xmath183 .",
    "it should be recollected that the inverse square potential has also finite number of pairs in the remote future in sec.[inv pot ] , in contrast to the solitonic gauge field .",
    "we have employed the evolution operator formalism to numerically study pair production in scalar qed by pulsed electric fields .",
    "the pulsed electric field is nontrivial in that it acts for a finite period of time and has the inhomogeneity of time .",
    "the hamiltonian for a spinless charged boson in time - dependent electric field is an infinite sum of oscillators with time - dependent frequencies . after expressing the oscillator hamiltonian in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of particle and antiparticle in the minkowski vacuum ,",
    "the evolution operator ( [ ev op ] ) in @xmath0 algebra is factorized into the pair annihilation part , the number part and the pair creation part .",
    "the advantage of this factorization is that the exact quantum state ( [ sq vac ] ) from the minkowski vacuum under the influence of a pulsed electric field is the squeezed vacuum of particle and antiparticle with a complex phase factor .",
    "the sum of all complex time - dependent phase factors for the number operator determines the vacuum polarization and the vacuum persistence , which in turn is related to the number of pairs produced by the pulsed electric field .",
    "now the time - dependent schrdinger equation is equivalent to a set of first order differential equations for the complex parameters for the evolution operator .",
    "the evolution of the minkowski vacuum is governed by three parameters in eqs.([gamma - i])-([xi - i ] ) , and thus the set of first order differential equations can implement numerical works for pair production in various configurations of the electric fields . remarkably the differential equations have the asymptotic solutions ( [ asym sol1 ] ) when the gauge potential vanishes and another solutions ( [ asym sol2 ] ) when the gauge potential approaches a constant value .",
    "these asymptotic solutions put a strong constraint on the behavior of number of pairs such that the number of pairs per unit volume and per unit time is a constant for the zero - gauge potential in the remote future but it oscillates around the time - averaged value for a non - zero gauge potential .",
    "for numerical works we have selected two classes of electric fields or gauge potentials . in the first class",
    "the electric field does not change the polarity of the field .",
    "therefore , the gauge potential , as the negative of the time integral of electric field , should have a non - zero value in the remote future .",
    "we have considered ( i ) sauter electric field , ( ii ) gaussian electric field and ( iii ) oscillating gaussian gauge potential as the first class of mono - polarity electric field . in the second class",
    "the electric field changes the polarity and has the gauge potential which vanishes in the remote future .",
    "we have considered in the second class ( iv ) di - polarity sauter electric field , two sauter fields separated by a time gap , ( v ) inverse square gauge potential and ( vi ) solitonic gauge potential , all of which have the di - polarity of field .",
    "we have computed the number of pairs as a function of time and longitudinal momentum for the pulsed electric fields of ( i)-(vi ) with the compton scale . in the first class ( i)-(iii ) , the number of pairs increases when the field acts and then oscillates around the time - averaged value as predicted by the asymptotic solutions . in general the number of pairs is suppressed for large longitudinal momentum as expected from the field equation in sec.[scat pic ] .",
    "the structure of longitudinal momentum spectrum is found for small momentum for ( i)-(iii ) .",
    "hebenstreit et al found the substructure of the spectrum in a sinusoidal electric field with gaussian envelope @xcite while the sinusoidal gauge potential is considered in this paper .",
    "also , the structure of the momentum spectrum has been found for the class ( v ) by dumlu and dunne @xcite .",
    "the number of pairs as a function time or a function of momentum shows similarity between the sauter electric field and the gaussian electric field .",
    "however , the momentum spectrum for the oscillating gaussian electric field reorganizes and bunches around one positive and one negative momenta with the same magnitude and the separation in the momentum space equals to the angular frequency of the oscillating electric field .",
    "we do not have a simple physical explanation for this bunching effect due to the oscillating field with a gaussian envelope .    in the second class of di - polarity field ( iv)-(vi )",
    "in which the gauge potential vanishes in the remote future , the number of pairs increases and then decreases to a constant rate and has relatively simpler structure of the longitudinal momentum than mono - polarity electric fields .",
    "still the longitudinal momentum spectrum for the di - polarity sauter electric field exhibits a surprising feature of negative or positive momentum dominance of produced pairs depending on whether the positively directed pulse or the negatively directed pulse acts first , which is then followed by the oppositely directed second pulse .",
    "further the solitonic gauge potential produces pairs in a symmetric way in time and returns back to the minkowski vacuum without any residual pairs .    in this paper",
    "we have confined our study to scalar qed in pulsed electric fields .",
    "however , there are a few issues related to but not treated in this paper .",
    "first , the evolution operator formalism can also apply to spinor qed , since the spin-1/2 fermions have @xmath188 algebra isomorphic to @xmath0 and may have an evolution operator similar to the spinless boson .",
    "another issue is the vacuum polarization , the real part of the in- and the out - vacua scattering amplitude . to get a finite effective action one should properly regularize the sum over the momentum of the real part of the scattering amplitude .",
    "still another issue is the back reaction of produced pairs .",
    "the strong field investigated in this paper produces roughly one pair per unit compton volume , which could generate an induced electric field screening the external field and cause another mechanism for the oscillation of produced pairs @xcite .",
    "finally , it would be extremely useful and promising for eli experimentation to have a similar evolution operator formalism for both spatially and temporally localized electric fields .",
    "all these issues go beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed in future publication .",
