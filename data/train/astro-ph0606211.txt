    "within the past decade it is being increasingly recognised that many of the clues to the fundamental problem of galaxy formation in the early universe are contained in the motions and chemical composition of long - lived stars in our milky way galaxy ( see e.g. freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "the recent discovery of several instances of tidal debris in our galaxy challenges the view laid down in the seminal paper by @xcite , who envision the galaxy to be formed in one major monolithic collapse at an early epoch , followed by a period of relative quiescence , lasting many gyr .",
    "these examples include the discovery of the tidally distorted / disrupted sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite , the photometrically identified low - latitude monoceros structure in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and the multitude of features in higher latitude fields @xcite .",
    "furthermore , within the context of the concordance lcdm scenario , sophisticated computer simulations of structure growth within a cdm universe have now begun to shed light on how the galaxy formation process may have taken place in a hierarchical framework ( see e.g. steinmetz & navarro 2002 , abadi et al .",
    "2003 , brook et al .",
    "2005 , governato et al .",
    "2004 , sommer - larsen et al .",
    "these analyses lead to a reinterpretation of structures such as the eggen moving groups @xcite or the omega cen globular cluster @xcite in terms of merger remnants .",
    "in fact , in the extreme case , structures , and old stars , in even the thin galactic disk are attributed to accretion events @xcite . in addition",
    ", strong evidence for accretion and assimilation of satellite galaxies can also be seen for other galaxies in the local group , in particular the ` great stream ' in m31 @xcite .",
    "however , whether the galaxy can indeed be formed by a sequence of merging events as predicted by current cosmological models of galaxy formation , or whether the few well - established accretion and merging remnants  which account for only a small fraction of the stellar mass of the galaxy  are all there is , is still a largely unanswered question .",
    "large kinematic surveys are needed , as are large surveys that derive chemical abundances , since both kinematics signatures and elemental abundance signatures persist longer than do spatial over - densities .",
    "it is still unclear ( wyse & gilmore 2006 ) , whether the observed chemical properties of the stars in the thick disk ( gilmore , wyse & jones 1995 ) can be brought into agreement with a scenario that sees the thick disk primarily as the result of accretion events @xcite .",
    "a similar question arises owing to the distinct age distribution ( unavane , wyse & gilmore 1996 , see however abadi et al .",
    "2003 ) and chemical elemental abundance distributions of stars in the stellar halo and in low - mass dwarf galaxies of the local group ( tolstoy et al .  2003 ; see however , robertson et al .  2005 ,",
    "bullock & johnston 2005 ) .",
    "stellar clusters , spiral arms , and the galactic bar leave an imprint in the chemical and stellar velocity distribution in the solar neighborhood ( dehnen 2000 ; quillen & minchev 2005 ; de simone et al .",
    "2004 ) as well .",
    "multidimensional databases are required to investigate and differentiate between these processes and structure caused by satellite accretion .",
    "the growing awareness of the importance of the ` fossil record ' in the milky way galaxy in constraining galaxy formation theory is reflected by the increasing number of missions designed to unravel the formation history of the galaxy .",
    "stellar spectroscopy plays a crucial role in these studies , not only providing radial velocities as a key component of the 6-dimensional phase space of stellar positions and velocities , but also providing much - needed information on the gravity and chemical composition of individual stars .",
    "an example of the power of such multidimensional stellar datasets have recently been shown by @xcite who , by using a combination of proper motions and distances from the hipparcos catalog @xcite and spectra from the geneva - copenhagen survey ( nordstrm et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter gcs ) were able to identify several accretion candidates within the immediate neighborhood of the sun .    however , despite the importance of stellar spectroscopy , the past decades have seen only limited progress . soon after @xcite measured the radial velocities of sirus and procyon",
    ", @xcite performed one of the first surveys , measuring 68 radial velocities for 29 stars , followed by 699 observations of 40 stars @xcite and 866 observations of 49 stars @xcite . since then , over the next 125 years",
    ", radial velocities for some 50,000 stars have become available in the public databases of the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg ( hereafter cds ) .",
    "this is surprisingly few , compared to the more than one million galaxy redshifts measured within the past decade .",
    "this sample of stellar radial velocities has recently been increased substantially by the gcs , containing radial velocities for 16,682 nearby dwarf stars , and by @xcite publishing 6,691 radial velocities for apparently bright giant stars .",
    "both catalogs were part of the hipparcos follow - up campaign .    with the advent of wide field multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) fiber systems in the 1990 s , pioneered particularly at the aao with focap , autofib and most recently with the 2df and 6df instruments on the aat and ukst respectively ( e.g. lewis et al .",
    "2002 and watson et al .",
    "2000 ) , the possibility of undertaking wide - area surveys with hemispheric coverage became feasible .",
    "initially , such projects were more concerned with large - scale galaxy and quasar redshift surveys ( e.g. colless et al .",
    "2001 for 2df and jones et al .",
    "2004 for 6df ) .",
    "apart from the samples of several hundred to a few thousand stars obtained prior to the commissioning of aaomega at the aat ( see for example kuijken & gilmore 1989a , b , c ; gilmore , wyse & jones 1995 ; wyse & gilmore 1995 ; gilmore , wyse & norris 2002 ) no large - scale , wide area stellar spectroscopy projects had been undertaken in our own galaxy .",
    "this has now changed with new surveys like sdssii / segue already under way , with a planned delivery of 240,000 spectra by mid 2008 @xcite , and the capabilities of aaomega on the aat . over a slightly longer time frame",
    ", the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) , the survey we describe in this paper , is expected to provide spectra for up to 1 million stars by 2011 .",
    "this trend for large stellar surveys will culminate with the esa cornerstone mission gaia , which , in addition to astrometric information , will provide multi - epoch radial velocities for up to one hundred million stars , by 2018 .",
    "each of these surveys has its own unique aspect , and they are largely complementary in capabilities and target sample .    with a radial velocity error of about 2  km / s and 80% of measurements",
    "better than 3.4  km / s , the rave velocities are accurate enough for almost any galactic kinematical study . radial velocities are however just one of the necessary stellar parameters : proper motions , distances and chemical abundances are also needed . proper motions of varying accuracy are available for most of the rave stars , via starnet2.0 , tycho-2 or sss .",
    "already , some of the cooler dwarfs ( @xmath3 ) with more accurate proper motions can be identified as dwarfs from their reduced proper motions .",
    "for these stars , it is possible to estimate all six phase space coordinates using their photometric parallaxes .    for most of these stars , there is no previous spectroscopic information , so the rave sample provides many scientific opportunities .",
    "some of the science programs in progress by rave team members include :    * discovery of extreme velocity stars and estimates of the local escape velocity and total mass of the galaxy * the 3d velocity distribution function of the local galactic disk * kinematics of the main stellar components of the galaxy * characterization of the local galactic disk potential and the structure of the disk components * substructure in the disk and halo of the galaxy , including the arcturus , sagittarius and other star streams * elemental abundances of high velocity stars * calibration of stellar atmospheric parameters and correspondence with the mk scheme through the hr diagram * searches for spectroscopic binaries and cataclysmic variables * the @xmath4  diffuse interstellar band as an estimator of interstellar reddening .    in this paper",
    "we describe the first data release of the rave survey which contains radial velocities obtained from rave spectra ( the spectra , stellar parameters and additional information will be part of the further releases as the first year spectra are contaminated by second order light ) .",
    "photometric and proper motion data from other surveys are also provided for ease of use .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the survey layout , technical equipment and input catalog .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the actual observations , followed by a section detailing the data reduction .",
    "section 5 discusses the data quality and compares rave data with independent data taken with other telescopes .",
    "finally , section 6 provides a detailed description of the data product of the first data release ( henceforth dr1 ) and concludes with longer term perspectives .",
    "the wide field - of - view of the uk schmidt and the multiplexing capability of 6df are well - matched to a survey of apparently bright stars .",
    "the scientific goals of rave include analysing the chemical and dynamical evolution of the galaxy , using as tracers both dwarfs and giants observed locally .",
    "most apparently bright stars will be in the thin and thick disks ; adopting a limiting magnitude of @xmath5 ( see below ) , dwarfs probe distances of hundreds of parsec and giants probe out to a few kiloparsec . with a sufficiently large sample ,",
    "even apparently bright stars will contain a statistically relevant sample of halo stars .",
    "the most efficient use of 6df is when exposure times on one field matches the set - up time for the next field ( see below ) and this implies a limiting magnitude of around @xmath6 . as noted above , rave is a precursor to gaia and the wavelength range for the rave spectra was chosen to match that of the gaia radial velocity spectrometer ( munari 2003 , katz et al .",
    "2004 , wilkinson et al .",
    "2005 ) , namely around the ca ii ir triplet .",
    "this wavelength range also includes lines due to iron , calcium , silicon , magnesium and titanium , and detailed analyses should provide an estimate of [ @xmath7/fe ] , in addition to overall metallicity .",
    "grids of synthetic spectra at resolution and wavelength range similar to those of rave , and covering wide ranges of @xmath8 , [ m / h ] , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , were calculated by @xcite . and are shown in their fig .",
    "a typical rave spectrum is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : nicespectrum ] .",
    "this shows a spectrum of hd 154837 ( k0  iii ) , as observed on sep 24 2004 , with the continuum normalized to 1.0 .",
    "the entire wavelength range is dominated by absorption lines ; the strongest due to fei , sii , tii and @xmath11c@xmath12n are identified .",
    "the hump in the continuum around 8508    is produced by an opacity minimum , due in particular to the absence of @xmath11c@xmath12n lines .",
    "this wavelength window implies that an @xmath13-band selection is most appropriate , and this is indeed the approach taken .",

    "magnitude , using the rave selection criteria of 9@xmath14i@xmath1412 within 6df fields of view ( 5.7 degree diameter ) , pointing in the galactic cardinal directions visible from the southern hemisphere .",
    "the total number of stars matching the rave criteria are given in parentheses in the key to the line types .",
    ", width=302 ]      the rave survey instrument is known as 6df @xcite in reference to its six degree diameter field of view .",
    "6df consists of an off - telescope robotic fiber positioner , two fiber - field plates of 150 fibers each and a bench - mounted spectrograph which is fed from the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) when one of the field plates is mounted on the telescope .",
    "the light received from the target is deflected down the fiber by a 90@xmath15 prism contained in a ` button ' at the end of the fiber .",
    "this button is magnetic , allowing secure placement of the fiber on the field plate .",
    "the robot uses a pneumatically actuated gripper to pick up , and to put down , the fiber buttons .",
    "each fiber has a diameter of @xmath16 m ( 6.7  arcsec on the sky ) , and can be placed accurately ( to within 10  microns , or 0.7  arcsec ) on star positions anywhere within the 6-degree diameter field .",
    "each field plate also contains 4 fiducial fiber bundles of 7  fibers arranged in a hexagonal pattern , which are used for field acquisition .",
    "the bench - mounted schmidt - type spectrograph sits on an optical bench on the floor of the telescope dome .",
    "the spectrograph therefore does not suffer from the flexure that affects telescope - mounted spectrographs which are subject to the changing gravity vector as the telescope moves across the sky .",
    "nevertheless , it is sensitive to temperature changes ( see section  [ s : zeropoint ] ) . with rave we use a specially purchased volume phase holographic ( vph ) transmission grating of medium dispersing power ; this 1700 lines / mm grating is tuned for high efficiency in the i - band , and identifed as grating 1700i .",
    "this setup provides in practice an average resolving power of @xmath27,500 over the ca - triplet region , covering the wavelength range 8,410 to 8,795   .",
    "the ccd used with the 6df spectrograph is a marconi ( eev ) ccd47 - 10-bi detector .",
    "it has 13  @xmath17 m pixels with a @xmath18 format and is thinned and back - illuminated .",
    "the actual ccd dimensions are @xmath19 pixels .",
    "the chip has good cosmetics , with few defects and has a quantum efficiency of 40% to 30% over the wavelength region of rave operations ( @xmath08,4008,800 ) .",
    "the rave spectrograph configuration , with the medium resolution vph transmission grating , unfortunately exacerbates the effects of the residual aberrations within the schmidt system .",
    "this leads to variable , position - dependent psfs and pin - cushion distortions .",
    "consequently , the existing pipeline reduction software , which was designed for the lower - resolution 6df galaxy redshift survey , does not work optimally with rave data ( but is more than adequate for quick - look , quality control purposes ) . a dedicated iraf pipeline was therefore developed for the reduction of rave data ( see section  4 for details ) .",
    "also most vph gratings exhibit a ` ghost ' , due to light reflected off the detector .",
    "this ghost manifests itself as a spurious emission peak in the spectra and can not be avoided in our rave observations .",
    "the wavelength of this ghost feature can be pushed into the blue part of the spectra using hardware tuning , and this wavelength region may then be excluded in the data analysis e.g.  when computing the radial velocity using cross - correlation techniques .",
    "not removing this feature properly would result in the correlation function having a strongly asymmetric profile .",
    "fortunately , this effect is only significant in a small fraction of our spectra and this is noted by a quality flag in the corresponding entries in the data release catalog ( see appendix  a tables  [ t : catalog_desc ] and [ t : spec_flag ] ) .",
    "each field plate nominally has 150 target fibers , which when undeployed form a ring round the periphery of the 6 degree field .",
    "the fibers are evenly spaced around this ring , with the exception of two small gaps at the northern and southern field plate edges .",
    "each gap creates a small ` zone of avoidance ' which has some ( small ) impact on the target distributions that can be achieved .",
    "similarly , there is a zone of avoidance , of less significance , associated with the pivot positions of each of the 4 guide fiber bundles , which are located approximately at the cardinal e - w / n - s points on each field plate .",
    "each target fiber can nominally reach the field centre , + 10% , and its deployed location relative to parked is subject to the constraint that the angle from the pure radial direction must be less than @xmath20 degrees .",
    "the targets in a given input field are allocated to a given fiber using a sophisticated field configuration algorithm ( fca ) , based on that developed for the 2df spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the fca accepts user - supplied priorities within the input target list , but does contain subtle allocation biases , as described by outram ( 2004 ) and @xcite .    these subtle allocation biases in the fca are illustrated for the rave targets in fig .",
    "[ f : footprint ] which shows contour plots of the successfully allocated targets , for the first year data , for each of the two field plates .",
    "the contour levels indicate the number of allocated stars per square degree .",
    "since stars are to first order uniformly distributed across the field - of - view , the non - uniform distribution of allocated targets highlights the inherent bias in the fiber placement .",
    "the empty notches at the top and bottom of each field plate are where no fiber buttons are positioned .",
    "the central under - allocated region is due to the known biases in the configure program , by which the central region is considered easy to reach and therefore left until after harder targets , close to the field edge , have been allocated .",
    "often this leaves fewer fibers than targets available for the centre .",
    "the remaining structure in these figures is the result of fibers being unavailable ( e.g.  due to breakages ) or having a shorter fiber length available ( after repair ) , re - inforcing the central deficiency .",
    "+        over the current survey lifetime both field plates have had , on average , 130 fibers available for allocation , an extremely consistent overall level for each .",
    "the @xmath215%  of fibers that are unavailable for allocation at any one time are due to a variety of causes .",
    "the most common problem is fiber breakages , that are largely the result of retractor problems on parking the fiber .",
    "another problem is fractures in the fibers themselves ( due to buttons ` stamping ' on them during fiber placement , or having the trailing short metal shank of the fiber bent on parking , via collisions with the pivot point ) .",
    "fractures may still allow light to be transmitted , but lead to severe fringing effects in any resultant spectrum .",
    "another problem is throughput deterioration of the fibers , possibly due to a gradual clouding over time of the uv curing optical adhesive used to mate fibers to prisms ( as was the case for the earlier ukst mos system flair @xcite ) .",
    "the final problem is related to the fiber - button gripper mechanism , which can lead to the robot being unable to pick - up or put - down some fibers .    among the problems listed above , the first two",
    "are linked to the integrity of the fibers and can be solved by repairing them .",
    "fiber repairs are a difficult and time - consuming process which usually involves a shortening of the fiber itself which , after several repairs , can reduce its effective range .",
    "nevertheless considerable effort has been expended to maintain the multiplex gain of each field plate .",
    "the original rave sample was intended to be magnitude - limited over the range @xmath21 , with no color selection ( where @xmath13 refers to cousin @xmath13 ) . at the time of the initial stages , data from the 2mass and denis surveys",
    "were not yet available , and the rave target stars were drawn from the tycho-2 catalog of the 2.5 million brightest stars @xcite and the supercosmos sky survey ( hambly et al .",
    "2001a , hereafter sss ) .",
    "the tycho observations were made in two non - standard filters , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these passbands were converted to johnson @xmath24 and @xmath25 using the transformation ( esa 1997 ) @xmath26    @xmath27 was transformed to @xmath13 using an empirically derived zeroth - order mean color transformation derived from bessell ( 1979 ) tables  2 and 3 :    @xmath28    the sss photometry @xcite is photographic @xmath13 ( ivn emulsion , hereafter @xmath29 ) , extracted from the src - i ukst ivn survey plates by supercosmos , the automatic plate scanning facility at the royal observatory , edinburgh .",
    "@xcite showed @xmath29 to be directly equivalent to cousin @xmath13 , essentially without any color correction , with a relation between the two magnitudes @xmath30    the @xmath31 interval of the first - year input catalog consists only of sss stars .",
    "stars with are mainly from tycho-2 but also includes sss stars that do not appear within 7  arcsec of any tycho-2 star ( this requirement is set by the 6df fiber diameter of 6.7  arcsec ) . any sss star that does appear within 7  arcsec of a tycho-2 star is not included , and neither is the tycho-2 star .",
    "this procedure allows us to avoid any contamination by a possible nearby star .",
    "the quality of the photometry ( not the astrometry ) in both catalogs is not sufficient to discriminate between the two possibilities that either ( i ) the two are in fact the same star measured to have different positions in each catalog , or ( ii ) the two are in fact two different stars .",
    "the criteria for inclusion in the input catalog are designed to merge the two samples , taking into account both their incompletenesses at @xmath32 ( the faint end of tycho-2 and the bright end of sss ) and the better proper motion accuracy provided by tycho-2 . as a result ,",
    "the interim input catalog contained @xmath2300,000 stars with @xmath250% tycho-2 and @xmath250% sss .",
    "we selected 478 contiguous survey fields to cover @xmath212,200 square degrees of the southern sky visible from the ukst , excluding regions with galactic latitude @xmath33 , to minimize dust obscuration and crowding .",
    "the field centres are defined on a @xmath34 grid spacing , corresponding to the field of view of the 6df field plates .",
    "the gaps in between the fixed circular tiling scheme miss about 20% of the available area .",
    "for each field of view , 400 targets were randomly selected from the input catalog to construct two field files , consisting of 200 stars in each , so that at least two separate 6df pointings could be made .    no sub - selection into bright and faint samples",
    "was made for the first 2.5 years of the rave survey , including the observations for this first data release .",
    "occasionally this leads to , for example , a 9@xmath35 magnitude star being adjacent on the slit to a significantly fainter , 12@xmath35 magnitude , star .",
    "the tight spacing of the 150 fibers along the slit , as imaged onto the ccd , means that about 4% of each spectrum s flux contaminates that of the adjacent fibers ( this effect is known as fiber cross - talk ) .",
    "this is an insignificant problem for radial velocity determinations for the vast majority of our targets , but can impact the abundance determinations , especially when the apparent magnitude difference between two adjacent fibers is large .",
    "this cross - talk effect is carefully taken into account by the reduction pipeline using iterative cleaning ( see section  4.2 ) .",
    "typically there are @xmath2200 potential targets for each field pointing at the rave magnitude limits which ensures efficient fiber configurations .",
    "the 6df configure software is usually able to allocate all the available science fibers to targets , unless two target stars are closer together than the minimum allowed separation dictated by the size of the 6df button footprint on the field - plate ( approximately 5  arcminutes ) .",
    "for the first year of rave , typically @xmath2130 fibers are allocated to target stars for a single pointing .",
    "this offers scope for two pointings on some fields and re - observation of selected targets ( repeats ) .",
    "both tycho-2 and sss are primarily astrometric catalogs and so only provide approximate photometry .",
    "the second denis data release , made public in 2003 , presented the first opportunity to compare the input catalog @xmath13 directly with more accurate @xmath13-band photometry ( better than 0.1 mag ) .",
    "as noted earlier , @xmath29 is equivalent to standard @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite showed that there is essentially no difference between gunn-@xmath36 ( denis @xmath13 ) and @xmath29 , allowing a direct comparison of input catalog @xmath13 with denis @xmath13 .",
    "[ f : input_cat ] ( top ) shows that the @xmath13magnitudes derived from the @xmath22 and @xmath23 photometry systematically agree with denis @xmath13 ( mean offset @xmath37  mag ) , albeit with a large scatter ( @xmath38  mag ) .",
    "the sss @xmath13magnitudes appear to be nonlinear , systematically diverging from the denis @xmath13 with brightness ( mean offset @xmath39  mag , @xmath40  mag ) .",
    "denis provides the first large - scale , external check on the accuracy of the sss photometry for bright stars .",
    "this diverging offset reflects the sss zeropoint error in linearizing the non - linear saturation of bright stars on photographic plates .",

    "this goal has not been compromised by the photometry on which the interim input catalog was based .    to summarize , the catalog has no kinematic bias , but galactic science using rave requires care to account for the various selection biases introduced by the inhomogeneous photometry used to derive the input sample .",

    "as a further check a blind comparison of these contaminants was made with the associated spectra to see if such blends were obvious . only a fraction ( 25% ) of the problem stars were obvious in the spectra .",
    "now we have a rigorous regime where all candidate stars are checked for possible contamination prior to observing , using the 1-arcmin sss thumbnails from the on - line sss @xmath45-band data .",
    "such contaminants are identified and removed from the database .",
    "observing time during the first year of the rave survey was confined to an average of seven bright / grey nights per lunation , distributed around ( but not including ) four or five unscheduled bright - of - moon nights .",
    "the project began on 2003 april 11 , and the first year s data includes spectra obtained between then and 2004 april 3 , for a total of 88 scheduled nights .",
    "observations for rave consist of a sequence of target field exposure , arc and flat . during the first year , ne , rb and hg - cd calibration exposures were obtained for each field , together with a quartz flat field for spectrum extraction in the data reduction .",
    "all calibration exposures were obtained by reflection from a white full - aperture diffusing screen located close to the entrance pupil of the telescope ( the schmidt corrector ) . in this position ,",
    "the effects of irregularities in the screen illumination are minimised , while the fibers are illuminated at a similar focal ratio ( f/2.5 ) to that of the incoming starlight .",
    "the requirement for arc and flat observations to be obtained for each field arises because the slit units are interchanged in the spectrograph for each new configuration ( along with the field plates in the telescope ) .",
    "several target fibers are reserved to monitor the sky for background subtraction . as rave stars are quite bright",
    ", only a small fraction of the signal in each fiber comes from the sky . in most cases",
    "only sky emission lines are present , with little or no background of scattered solar spectrum from the moon , despite the fact that most first year observations were obtained in bright or grey time .",
    "it is thus necessary to subtract this sky using measurements from dedicated sky fibers , placed uniformly across the field .",
    "a calculation of the optimal number of sky fibers per plate is given in kuijken & gilmore ( 1989b ) , while a detailed description of sky - subtraction with fibers is given in wyse & gilmore ( 1992 ) .",
    "each of the rave target frames therefore contained spectra of at least ten sky samples , obtained using dedicated sky fibers .",
    "these were combined and scaled in the reduction process for sky subtraction .    on a subset of nights ( of order one in four ) ,",
    "twilight exposures were also taken to provide additional zero - point velocity checks from solar absorption features and twilight sodium d lines .",
    "these were obtained with the telescope pointing towards the zenith , and taken within thirty minutes of sunset or sunrise .",
    "those twilights frames are particularly useful to assess the zero point stability and enable some more radial velocity checks .",
    "the target frames themselves consist of five consecutive exposures of 600 seconds each , allowing adequate signal - to - noise to be obtained in the summed spectra , while minimizing the risk of saturation from particularly bright stars . in poor conditions of low sky transparency ,",
    "additional exposures are made .",
    "the total time for a ` standard ' set of arc , flat and field exposures is of order one hour , which is similar to the fiber reconfiguration time in the 6df robot .",
    "thus , while observing proceeds with one field plate , the other is being reconfigured , maximizing the time - on - target productivity of the telescope .",
    "taking account of the physical transportation and exchange of the field plates , the slew time for the telescope , field acquisition etc .",
    ", an experienced observer is able to accumulate acceptable data for up to eight rave fields on a mid - winter s night at the latitude of siding spring observatory .",
    "the median seeing at the focal surface of the schmidt telescope ( i.e. including local site effects and convolved with the instrumental psf ) is @xmath22.5 arcsec .",
    "this is much less than the 6.7 arcsec diameter of the fibres , and so some seeing degradation is possible without serious loss of flux . in extremely poor conditions ,",
    "however ( seeing @xmath24 arcsec ) , there is a noticeable loss of signal .",
    "this is principally due to the difficulty in obtaining perfect target acquisition because the seeing degrades spatial resolution in the guide fibre bundles .",
    "fortunately , such poor seeing is relatively rare ( @xmath21015 percent of clear time ) .    during the first year of rave operations ,",
    "no blocking filter was used to isolate the spectral range required , so there is second order contamination of the spectra .",
    "flux in the approximate wavelength range @xmath0 42004400   is therefore added to that in the primary spectral range ( @xmath0 84108790  ) . in practice , this is only a serious problem for hotter stars ( earlier spectral types than @xmath2f ) , but features such as h@xmath46 will be present at a low level in all stars .",
    "the final tally for the first year s observations was 24,748 target stars in 240 fields .",
    "of these stars , 24,320 were observed once , 330 twice and 98 three times .",
    "a small subset of these stars ( @xmath2100 ) were also observed with the 2.3-m telescope of the australian national university at siding spring observatory and the elodie chelle spectrograph at the observatoire de haute - provence ( france ) , and a further small number was found to be part of the gcs sample .",
    "those observations are described in more details in section  [ s : external_datasets ] .",
    "data reduction for the rave project consists of two phases .",
    "first a quick - look data reduction is carried out at the telescope using aao software .",
    "this was originally the 2dfdr package developed for the 2df galaxy redshift survey .",
    "it was modified to reduce 6df data for the 6df galaxy survey ( therefore named 6dfdr for 6df data reduction software ) . at rave",
    "s high dispersion , the wavelength modelling of 6dfdr was too crude to allow arc lines to be correctly identified .",
    "therefore , the spectrograph optics model in 6dfdr has been upgraded to allow correct line identification at all dispersions .",
    "6dfdr was used to reduce rave data using simple fiber extractions from the raw data frames ( summing pixel values over a fixed width around each fiber trace ) , without subtracting scattered light .",
    "6dfdr was upgraded to ravedr in november 2004 to include scattered light subtraction .",
    "note that ravedr ( and 6dfdr ) are able to perform more sophisticated fiber extractions , which fit profiles to each fiber cross - section to reduce fiber cross - talk .",
    "however , this critically depends on the accurate subtraction of scattered light .",
    "the current scattered light model is only valid for all stars of equal brightness , which is not always the case for rave s observations .",
    "also , rave s bright star observations cause the more sophisticated fiber extraction to be unstable so the simple method is used .",
    "this results in fiber cross - talk being not optimally modelled with ravedr .",
    "therefore an iraf - based data reduction pipeline has been built to reduce rave observations .",
    "this pipeline is described in section  [ s : raw_reduction ] .",
    "nevertheless , the ravedr reductions by the ukst observers remain useful as the first of many data quality checks .",
    "raw data are reduced with a custom iraf pipeline .",
    "the pipeline uses three types of exposures to reduce every field : a set of scientific exposures is followed by a neon arc and a flatfield exposure .",
    "the flatfield frame is used to identify the location on the ccd of the different spectra of individual fibers .",
    "this is done automatically , using the information that there are small additional gaps following the fibers with numbers 50 and 100 .",
    "the pixels associated with all fibers exceeding a threshold signal are extracted .",
    "this allows the evaluation of fiber cross - talk and scattered light for any fiber with contributing light , even if it has been identified as broken .",
    "the fibers are relatively close to each other on the ccd , with a typical fiber - to - fiber separation being approximately twice the fwhm of their spatial psf profile .",
    "fiber cross - talk therefore needs to be analysed and included in the reduction procedures .",
    "we adopted the following procedure : first , all light within @xmath47  fwhm of a given fiber center is attributed to this fiber .",
    "next , a gaussian , modelling the contribution from the neighboring fibers , is subtracted , and then the whole procedure is iterated twice .",
    "we estimate , from our experience , that in the final spectrum less than 1% of the flux is due to stars in adjacent fibers along the slit , even if those adjacent stars are 2.5  mag brighter .",
    "this level of residual contamination is certainly acceptable .",
    "the scattered light background requires a different careful treatment .",
    "it is relatively strong and there are no large gaps in the distribution of fibers on the entrance slit that allow for its easy determination .",
    "the scattered light is modelled by spreading a fraction of the total stellar light to a wide , axially symmetric gaussian profile ( see wyse & gilmore 1992 for discussion ) .",
    "its width is @xmath21/3 of the ccd chip size and its intensity @xmath213% of the stellar flux .",
    "these two parameter values are determined iteratively by checking the residuals in flatfield and scientific exposures .",
    "spectra of sky fibers ( background ) typically feature only sky emission lines ( @xmath290% of the cases ) , so their zero continuum value is used as a further check on the consistency of the scattered light model . in the remaining 10% ,",
    "scattered light from cirrus clouds and/or moonlight add an absorption spectrum to the sky spectra ( resulting in a non - zero continuum ) .",
    "those cases are easily detected via the existence of calcium absorption lines in the spectra . here",
    "we check that the ca lines have meaningful intensities ( eg .",
    "counts at the center are non negative ) .",
    "other tasks performed by the iraf pipeline include flatfielding , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction and heliocentric correction .",
    "flatfielding is crucial , as fringing is very strong at the wavelengths of rave spectra .",
    "wavelength calibration is achieved by a low order polynomial fit to 9 ne arc lines .",
    "the sky to be subtracted from all spectra is determined as a median of those sky fiber spectra which are found to be free from stellar contamination , fiber cross - talk or ghost peaks .",
    "the observed wavelengths are corrected for the rotation of the earth , the motion of the earth about the earth - moon barycenter , and the orbit of the barycenter about the sun .",
    "the corresponding formulae are given in the help file of the procedure _ rvcorrect _ in iraf .",
    "the resulting transformation from observed to heliocentric velocities should be accurate to 0.005  km / s .",
    "a median combination of a sequence of five 600  s exposures produces the final spectrum with improved signal to noise ratio ( snr ) and essentially free from cosmic ray hits ( except for cosmic ray hits in the 250  s exposure of the flat field ) .",
    "values of all parameters used during reduction are recorded in the reduced file s header , while any peculiarities are noted in the appropriate reduction logs .",
    "the procedure is automated , but the user is asked to confirm manually the crucial steps : fiber identification , scattered light subtraction parameters , quality of wavelength solution for each fiber and the appearance of fibers with sky ( background ) spectra .",
    "this ensures that errors due to problems with the weather or the instrument do not compromise the results .",
    "an experienced user needs @xmath220  minutes to reduce the sequence of 5 scientific exposures of a given field , together with their flatfield and arc exposures .",
    "the measurement of radial velocities is performed by an automatic pipeline ( see fig .",
    "[ f : rv_pipeline ] for a schematic description ) which uses a standard cross - correlation procedure @xcite .",
    "the speed of such routines , based on fourier transforms , makes them well adapted to large datasets like rave where many radial velocity derivations have to be performed . here",
    ", the pipeline uses the package xcsao for iraf @xcite , as it combines both the speed of the cross - correlation techniques and adequate formats for the outputs .",
    "when computing the radial velocities , the blue and red ends of the spectra are rejected , the effective wavelength interval used being 8,460     to 8,746   .",
    "the reason for this is to avoid the poorer focus , lower resolving power and lower quality of the wavelength calibration at the edges of the spectral interval , while also excluding , in most of the cases , the emission ghost feature at @xmath48     which was discussed in section  [ s : instrument ] .",
    "prior to the radial velocity determination , the spectra are also continuum normalized using a cubic spline .",
    "a cosine - bell filter is used to minimize the effects of ( high frequency ) noise and the radial velocity is calculated by fitting a parabola to the top of the correlation peak ( the top 20% of the correlation function is used throughout the pipeline ) . + measuring radial velocities using cross - correlation techniques relies on the availability of accurate stellar templates to correlate with the observed spectra . generally , one template or a reduced set of templates",
    "is used so as to match a given spectral type . as the rave sample covers the entire color - magnitude diagram , and therefore includes large ranges of stellar physical properties such as @xmath49 , @xmath9 , @xmath50}$ ] and rotational velocity ,",
    "a large number of templates is needed in order to obtain accurate radial velocities for all targets .",
    "we use the library of theoretical spectra from @xcite covering the rave wavelength interval .",
    "this library contains 62,659 synthetic spectra at the rave / gaia resolution , constructed using kurucz model atmosphere code ( atlas ) .",
    "it covers an extensive range of physical conditions of the stellar atmosphere . + as no blue blocking filter ( og531 ) was used during the first year of observations , the resulting second order contamination needs to be taken into account .",
    "the second order templates ( requiring a bluer wavelength range than the zwitter et al .",
    "spectra ) are taken from the @xcite library , which contains 28,180 synthetic atlas spectra which have been degraded to rave s resolution .",
    "the combination of both libraries leads to a set of 22,992 synthetic spectra that are used for this first release .",
    "the range in effective temperature of this library is @xmath51 , giving good coverage of all spectral types .",
    "@xmath52 varies from @xmath53 to @xmath54 in steps of @xmath55 , while the metallicity [ m / h ] is computed for @xmath56 $ ] , all scaled solar elemental abundances .",
    "the rotation velocities range from 0  km / s to 500  km / s , with irregular spacing . for the entire library of synthetic spectra",
    ", the microturbulent velocity is assumed to have the value of @xmath57  km / s . + the number of template spectra is sufficiently large that it is not possible to compute the correlation function for all of them .",
    "therefore , the radial velocities are obtained using a four - step process . in step  1 ,",
    "we perform a first guess of the radial velocity using a reduced set of 40 templates covering evenly the parameter space of @xmath49 , @xmath52 and 1st/2nd order ratio ( matching spectral type in the template is more important for radial velocity determination than is metallicity ) .",
    "this first estimate provides a median internal accuracy of @xmath25  km / s for most of the caii - dominated spectra .",
    "for early type stars , where the paschen lines are dominant , the accuracy is lower , due to the large width of those hydrogen lines . as a comparison ,",
    "the pixel size in velocity space for a typical rave spectrum varies from 12  km / s to 14  km / s from the red to the blue , with a mean value of 13  km / s .",
    "therefore , with careful analysis and high snr , we can expect to reach a @xmath21.3  km / s internal accuracy for the radial velocities ( one tenth of a pixel in velocity space ) .    in step",
    "2 , using this first estimate of the radial velocity , the observed spectrum is shifted to the rest frame and compared to the full template database to select the ` best - matching ' synthetic spectra .",
    "the best - matching template is defined as the spectrum ( a combination of one 1st - order synthetic spectrum and one 2nd - order synthetic spectrum ) which minimizes the quantity : @xmath58 ^ 2\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the continuum - normalized observed target spectrum , @xmath60 are the continuum - normalized 1st and 2nd order templates and @xmath61 is the fractional 2nd order contamination .",
    "this equation does not account for a color term which is expected because of the shape of the continuum between the first - order and second - order wavelength range . nevertheless , this effect is small ( due to the limited range in wavelength of the rave spectra , only @xmath62   ) compared to other sources of error , such as noise in the observed spectra or residual scattered light .",
    "furthermore , including a color term properly would require continuum normalization for each possible combination of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath61 , which is beyond the computational time limit for the pipeline .",
    "finally , to speed up selection of the best template , @xmath61 is not treated as a continuous variable , but rather is limited to discrete values between 0 and 0.8 , spaced by 0.1 , covering the possible values of this parameter .",
    "an example of the acceptable fit that is the outcome of this template - fitting procedure is given in fig .",
    "[ f : template_fit ] .",

    ", width=264 ]    at step  3 , the appropriate template having been chosen , a new radial velocity is calculated . in step  4 , this new determination is corrected for a possible zero - point offset .",
    "this final correction , as well as its origin , are discussed in the next section .",
    "+ at each of the important steps in this process the pipeline produces summary plots which are used to detect possible problems .",
    "information from those quality - check outputs are reported in the final catalog released to the public .",
    "also , note that the output spectra of the reduction pipeline are in the heliocentric reference frame ( see section  [ s : raw_reduction ] ) and therefore , the radial velocities provided in the catalog are heliocentric .",
    "analysis of raw arc frames taken before and after observations of rave fields showed that the positions of the emission lines in one of the arcs are sometimes shifted along the spectral axis on the ccd relative to the other arc .",
    "the origin of this shift is most likely to be temperature variations in the spectrograph room , which induce a slight change in some of the optical components .",
    "this results in a small offset in the dispersion direction , of the order of a few tenths of a pixel , between the two arc frames .",
    "this will also cause an offset between a scientific frame and the arc frame used to calibrate that science frame .",
    "the result is a zero - point offset in the measured radial velocities .",
    "a tenth of a pixel corresponds to less than 1.5  km / s , and this is then the order of the zero - point offset .    both hardware and software were investigated to find the source of the arc shifts .",
    "the slit - vane assembly was found to be vibrationally stable , despite sharing the same mounting on the optical bench as the spectrograph shutter .",
    "the spectrograph room temperature is only recorded at the start of a rave setup , so the temperature change over the course of a rave observation is not known .",

    "the central fiber of each arc frame was extracted and cross - correlated with the central fiber of the first arc frame .",
    "the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) peak position corresponds to the overall emission line shift in pixels between each set of arcs .",
    "the bottom of fig .",
    "[ f : pixel_shift ] shows a negative pixel shift trend as a result of a positive temperature change , suggesting that the spectrograph room is not a thermally stable environment and that this is responsible for the radial velocity zero - point offset .",
    "if the glass vph grating were expanding with temperature , the pixel shift would be positive according to the grating equation , implying that this is not the source of the zero - point shift .",
    "the thermal expansion coefficient of steel is 1.44 times that of ordinary glass but steel s thermal conductivity is almost 63 times greater than that of glass .",
    "this suggests that various metal components of the spectrograph are temperature sensitive and thus are responsible for the zero - point shifts .",
    "frequent monitoring of spectrograph temperature in future should improve our understanding of the zero - point shifts .",
    "given that we do not know the temperature change between a given arc frame and the observation frame to be calibrated with the arc , we need to establish the radial velocity zero - point independent of the arc frames .",
    "we therefore developed a procedure using the sky emission lines that are visible in the rave wavelength region .",
    "we carry out a standard cross - correlation technique with the non sky - subtracted target frames , again using the median spectrum for each fiber from the set of @xmath66 scientific exposures .",
    "we use a sky spectrum from the osterbrock sky spectra , degraded to rave s resolution , as a template and compute , for each fiber , the radial velocity associated with the sky in that fiber . as the snr for the sky lines is low , this measurement is precise only to a few km / s ( the average radial velocity error for sky spectra is 6  km / s ) .",
    "therefore a direct correction of a given star s radial velocity using the measurement of the sky zero - point in the sky+star spectrum can not be made .",
    "we instead use the fact that across a frame , the expected zero - point variation is smooth from fiber to fiber , so that a better zero - point estimation can be obtained by fitting a low - order polynomial to the \\{rv , fiber } data set .",
    "also , in order to give more weight in the fitting procedure to the dedicated sky fibers , and to the fibers containing better sky spectra ( in the sense that their correlation with the template leads to more accurate velocities ) , the individual weight follows the tonry - davis @xmath45 value .",
    "further , to reject all unreliable measurements from the fit , fibers with a correlation coefficient lower than 5 are discarded . finally , the weight for the dedicated sky fibers is doubled , to give an even stronger constraint using the fibers with no stellar spectra .",

    "therefore this information should be used with caution .",
    "photometric variability is an efficient way to discover binary systems with periods of hours or days @xcite , while systems with periods of hundreds of years are spatially resolved ( see figs .  3 and 4 from zwitter & munari 2004 ) .",

    "<S> we present the first data release of the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) , an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities and stellar atmosphere parameters ( temperature , metallicity , surface gravity ) of up to one million stars using the 6df multi - object spectrograph on the 1.2-m uk schmidt telescope of the anglo - australian observatory ( aao ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rave program started in 2003 , obtaining medium resolution spectra ( median r=7,500 ) in the ca - triplet region ( @xmath0 8,4108,795  ) for southern hemisphere stars drawn from the tycho-2 and supercosmos catalogs , in the magnitude range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the first data release is described in this paper and contains radial velocities for 24,748 individual stars ( 25,274 measurements when including re - observations ) . </S>",
    "<S> those data were obtained on 67 nights between 11 april 2003 to 03 april 2004 . the total sky coverage within this data release is @xmath24,760 square degrees . </S>",
    "<S> the average signal to noise ratio of the observed spectra is 29.5 , and 80% of the radial velocities have uncertainties better than 3.4  km / s . combining internal errors and zero - point errors , </S>",
    "<S> the mode is found to be 2  km / s . </S>",
    "<S> repeat observations are used to assess the stability of our radial velocity solution , resulting in a variance of 2.8  km / s . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the radial velocities derived for the first data set do not show any systematic trend with color or signal to noise . </S>",
    "<S> the rave radial velocities are complemented in the data release with proper motions from starnet 2.0 , tycho-2 and supercosmos , in addition to photometric data from the major optical and infrared catalogs ( tycho-2 , usno - b , denis and 2mass ) . </S>",
