    "the fundamental parameter in barred galaxy ( sb ) dynamics is their bar pattern speed , @xmath0 , which can be parametrized by the ratio @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the corotation radius and @xmath3 is the bar semi - major axis .",
    "a bar is termed fast when @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5-body simulations by debattista & sellwood ( 1998 ) , following the theoretical work of weinberg ( 1985 ) , showed that dynamical friction on a bar from an isotropic dark matter halo preserves a fast bar only if the disk is very close to maximal , in the sense that the luminous disk provides most of the rotational support in the inner galaxy .",
    "tremaine & ostriker ( 1999 ) suggested that a flattened , rapidly rotating inner halo can reduce dynamical friction sufficiently to preserve fast bars even in sub - maximal disks , but debattista & sellwood ( 2000 ) showed that the halo rotation required is large ; the stellar halo of the milky way shows no evidence for such large rotation .",
    "indirect evidence for fast bars in sb galaxies comes from hydrodynamical models of gas flow , particularly at the shocks .",
    "three such studies are : @xmath6 in ngc 1365 ( lindblad  1996 ) , @xmath6 in ngc 1300 ( lindblad & kristen 1996 ) , and @xmath7 for ngc 4123 ( weiner  2000 , who also showed that a @xmath8 maximal disk is highly favored in ngc 4123 ) .",
    "a direct , model - independent method for measuring @xmath0 , developed by tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ) gives @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are galaxy - centered coordinates parallel and perpendicular to the disk s major axis , and all averages are at fixed @xmath11 and weighted by the luminosity .",
    "using the tremaine - weinberg ( tw ) method with slit spectra , merrifield & kuijken ( 1995 ) and gerssen  ( 1998 ) found fast bars in ngc 936 @xmath12 and ngc 4596 @xmath13 respectively .",
    "no slow bars ( @xmath14 ) in high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies have been discovered to date .",
    "we used the tw method to measure @xmath0 in ngc 7079 , using a full-2d velocity field .",
    "we observed ngc 7079 with the rutgers fabry - perot imaging interferometer on the ctio 4 m telescope .",
    "we used the caii 8542.14   absorption line , redshifted to 8618  , scanning the spectrum from @xmath15   to @xmath16  , in steps of @xmath17  , for a total of 25 exposures of 900 seconds each .",
    "voigt profiles were fitted to the spectrum at each pixel of the reduced images , giving maps of the velocity and dispersion .",
    "data extracted along the slit pas of bettoni & galletta ( 1997 , bg97 ) match their data with a worst reduced @xmath18 for 15 degrees of freedom . the rotation curve , which we then corrected for asymmetric drift , was extracted using a tilted ring fit .",
    "we used ellipse fits to @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 exposures obtained at the ctio 0.9 m telescope to obtain @xmath24 , pa @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 map shows near - constant color for the disk and bulge separately , indicating uniform ( or zero ) internal extinction .    applying the tw equation , we obtain @xmath28 , which gives @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 , making this a fast bar .",
    "ngc 7079 is a currently undisturbed , hsb galaxy , offset only 0.3 mag from the tully - fisher relation of courteau & rix ( 1992 ) . the nearest galaxy , eso 287 - 37 , is at a projected separation of 363 kpc ; assuming a relative velocity of 300",
    ", their last closest approach would have been over 1 gyr , or about 8 bar rotations , ago , long enough for a bar in a sub - maximal disk to have slowed down significantly .",
    "bg97 reported faint o[iii ] emitting gas out to @xmath31 counter - rotating relative to the stars .",
    "if it originated in an accretion event , this gas , being retrograde , could not have added angular momentum to the bar .",
    "ngc 7079 must therefore be a maximum disk .",
