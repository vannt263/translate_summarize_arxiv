    "besides the electric - magnetic duality of the vacuum maxwell equations , the first example of a duality transformation relating the strong coupling regime of one field theoretic system with the weak coupling regime of the same or another system was probably the kramers - wannier transformation for the ising model @xcite .",
    "this transformation was generalized to a wide class of abelian lattice models ( spin models , gauge theories and their higher rank tensor generalizations ) in any euclidean space - time dimension . for a review see  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we generalize the transformation to the case of lattice gauge theory with a non - abelian gauge group @xmath0 ( our proofs are valid for compact lie groups and finite groups ) .",
    "the resulting dual model generalizes the well - known results for the abelian case and is described in terms of the finite - dimensional unitary representations of @xmath0 , their representation morphisms ( intertwiners ) and the character expansion of the boltzmann weight . in particular , all group integrations are explicitly performed .",
    "the method we use is the peter - weyl decomposition of the algebra @xmath2 of representation functions of @xmath0 , the ` algebraic functions ' on @xmath0",
    ". this decomposition can be viewed as a generalization of fourier transformation to functions on a compact non - abelian lie group .",
    "it is convenient to exploit the hopf algebra structure of @xmath2 and to employ a purely algebraic description of the haar measure .",
    "the duality transformation follows the lines of the well - known abelian case , but some attention and geometric intuition is necessary to make the generalized gauge constraint appear in a local form in the dual model .",
    "the duality transformation establishes the equality of the partition function and the expectation value of the non - abelian wilson loop ( the generic gauge invariant expression which is given by a spin network ) with their corresponding purely algebraic expressions in the dual model .",
    "the dual model is found to have a boltzmann weight of such a form that the strong coupling regime of non - abelian lattice gauge theory is mapped to the weak coupling regime of the dual model .",
    "in addition , the strong coupling expansion can be applied to this reformulation of non - abelian gauge theory in a systematic way .",
    "the duality relation is stated in theorems  [ thm_dualpartition1 ] and  [ thm_dualwilson1 ] which form the main result of this paper .",
    "the dual model is a system in statistical mechanics whose configurations are spin foams on the lattice .",
    "these configurations are assigned boltzmann weights and are subject to certain constraints .",
    "spin foams have been introduced in the study of quantum gravity , see  @xcite and the recent introductory article  @xcite .",
    "the configurations of our dual model are closed spin foams on the lattice according to the definition given in  @xcite .",
    "the transformation thus provides an explicit example for the relation of lattice gauge theory with a particular spin foam model .",
    "the dual model reduces to the known results for non - abelian gauge theory in @xmath3 dimensions where the partition function is particularly simple , as well as to the known results for abelian lattice gauge theory in arbitrary dimension ,  in the cases @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "whereas the duality transformation in the abelian case is known to work in a similar way for spin models , gauge theories and higher rank tensor models on the lattice  @xcite , this is not the case for the non - abelian generalization .",
    "even though it can be applied to spin models in a straight forward way , the resulting ` gauge ' constraint can not be cast in a local form .",
    "the motivation for deriving a dual description of non - abelian lattice gauge theory arises from conceptual issues such as the ` dual superconductor ' picture of confinement and from rigorous studies in the framework of constructive quantum field theory as well as from technical and numerical problems in lattice gauge theory .    at present",
    "only a few ways of studying gauge theories in their strong coupling regime are known  in particular if there are no additional symmetries like supersymmetry . in the famous paper by wilson  @xcite ,",
    "the lattice formulation of @xmath7 gauge theory was used in conjunction with the high temperature expansion which is known from statistical mechanics and which plays the role of a strong coupling expansion .    the duality transformation for abelian lattice gauge theories ( see  @xcite ) can be seen on the one hand as a result of attempts to make this strong coupling expansion systematic . on the other hand",
    "there is the picture of ` dual superconductivity ' as an explanation of confinement going back to ideas of thooft and mandelstam , see  @xcite .",
    "whereas in a superconductor electrically charged quasi - particles condense and force the magnetic flux into quantized tubes , the picture is that in a gauge theory with confinement , magnetic monopoles condense .",
    "this leads to the formation of electric flux tubes which are responsible for the linearity of the static potential between opposite external electric charges .    in this picture",
    "the magnetic monopoles appear as collective excitations of the gauge theory .",
    "they are found to be quantized topological defects  @xcite .",
    "the abelian duality transformation allows one to spot these topological degrees of freedom .",
    "all group integrations are performed , and the partition function of abelian lattice gauge theory is rewritten in new variables such that the topological degrees of freedom have the form of ordinary expectation values of the dual fields .    in the abelian case ,",
    "the lattice approach to gauge theories in conjunction with the duality transformation and related techniques has lead to a number of remarkable results .",
    "we mention the existence of a phase transition in @xmath7 lattice gauge theory in @xmath8 @xcite , the existence of world - lines of magnetic monopoles in the same model which behave like infra - particles @xcite , the fact that these are responsible for the phase transition by condensation of magnetic monopoles , and finally the absence of a deconfinement phase transition in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the picture of dual superconductivity leading to confinement in the abelian case is well established , see  the study of the monopole degrees of freedom in monte - carlo simulations  @xcite and their properties at the deconfining phase transition  @xcite of @xmath7 lattice gauge theory in @xmath8 .",
    "although there are strong conjectures both from lattice studies of qcd and from results in supersymmetric yang - mills theory that confinement in non - abelian gauge theories can be described in a similar way by dual superconductivity , no analogous approach is available for non - abelian gauge theory . the exact duality transformation presented in this paper",
    "is meant to be a first step in this direction .",
    "finally , we comment on the relations of this work with other approaches .",
    "firstly , in the abelian case , the dual model is again a gauge theory if certain cohomologies of the space - time lattice are trivial .",
    "the case of general topology is studied in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath10 lattice gauge theory , there are results by explicit computations which relate this theory to certain simplex models of gravity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there has been an interesting categorial approach to models which could be dual to non - abelian gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "it uses the same colouring of links and plaquettes of the lattice with representations and intertwiners , respectively , as our dual model does on the dual lattice in @xmath9 and seems to enjoy many close similarities .",
    "however , the gauge degrees of freedom proposed in  @xcite are not in a straight forward way a symmetry of the dually transformed model as derived in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , the ideas developed there might prove useful for a further study of the dual model .",
    "we thank m.b .",
    "halpern for bringing the paper  @xcite to our attention . in",
    "@xcite a plaquette formulation of lattice gauge theory is derived emphasizing the non - abelian bianchi identity . using the mathematical methods that we describe in sections  [ sect_prelimhopf ] to  [ sect_prelimhaar ] , it can be shown that the approach of  @xcite can be extended to a full duality transformation similar to the treatment in our section  [ sect_transform ] .",
    "the result would be the same as given in theorem  [ thm_dualpartition1 ] .",
    "finally , we thank a referee for drawing our attention to the paper  @xcite where a duality transformation of classical yang - mills theory in continuous space - time based on the loop approach is suggested .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sect_prelim ]",
    ", we recall all definitions and structures which are needed to present the duality transformation .",
    "in particular these are the structure of the hopf algebra of representation functions @xmath2 of @xmath0 and the lattice formulation of gauge theories .    in section  [ sect_transform ] , we present the duality transformation in detail first for the partition function , and then for the non - abelian generalizations of the wilson loop .",
    "we specialize our result to the known cases of non - abelian lattice gauge theory in @xmath3 dimensions and to abelian lattice gauge theory in arbitrary dimension in section  [ sect_special ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sect_outlook ] we indicate how the dual formulation can be used in conjunction with strong coupling expansion techniques and discuss open questions and directions for further research .",
    "in this section we collect definitions and basic statements related to the algebra of representation functions @xmath2 of @xmath0 . these and the results presented in the next section about the peter - weyl decomposition and the peter - weyl theorem are basically text book knowledge , see  @xcite .",
    "we recall the basic facts to fix our notation and present a purely algebraic treatment of the relevant results which we have not found elsewhere in this form .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite group or a compact lie group .",
    "we denote finite - dimensional complex vector spaces on which @xmath0 is represented by @xmath11 and by @xmath12 the corresponding group homomorphisms .",
    "since each finite - dimensional complex representation of @xmath0 is equivalent to a unitary representation , we select a set @xmath13 containing one unitary representation of @xmath0 for each equivalence class of finite - dimensional representations .",
    "the tensor product , the direct sum and taking the dual are supposed to be closed operations on this set .",
    "this amounts to a particular choice of representation isomorphisms @xmath14 , @xmath15 , which is implicit in our formulas .",
    "we furthermore denote by @xmath16 the subset of irreducible representations .    if @xmath17 , we write @xmath18 for the dual representation and denote the dual vector space of @xmath11 by @xmath19 .",

    "moreover , all representations of @xmath48 are tensor products of representations of @xmath0 such that we have an isomorphism of algebras @xmath49 which is used in the definition of the coproduct .",
    "this tensor product is algebraic , and there is no need for a topology or a completion of the tensor product at this point .    in the standard orthonormal bases ,",
    "the representation functions are given by the coefficients of representation matrices , @xmath50 such that the coproduct corresponds to the matrix product , @xmath51 while the antipode refers to the inverse matrix , @xmath52 , and the co - unit describes the coefficients of the unit matrix , @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , the antipode relates a representation with its dual , @xmath54 which is just the conjugate representation because on the other hand @xmath55 here the bar denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the structure of the algebra @xmath2 can be understood if @xmath2 is considered as a representation of @xmath48 by combined left and right translation of the function argument , @xmath56 it can then be decomposed into its irreducible components as a representation of @xmath48 :    let @xmath0 be a finite group or a compact lie group .",
    "there is an isomorphism @xmath57 of representations of @xmath48 . here",
    "the direct sum is over one unitary representative of each equivalence class of finite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",

    "recall that the enumeration of the indices @xmath196 for a given plaquette @xmath119 was done starting with @xmath197 at the point @xmath103 , then proceeding counter - clockwise in the @xmath198-plane .",
    "it is thus possible to associate the summations over the @xmath196 with the lattice points @xmath199 . for each link @xmath117",
    ", one of the two projectors in   then belongs to @xmath103 , the other to @xmath102 .",

    ", there is in total one such summation over projectors for each link of the lattice .",
    "it is thus natural to consider these summations as part of the dual path integral .",
    "if this is done , we can reorganize the expressions such that all vector index summations and projectors are associated with the lattice points @xmath199 and such that they involve only data from the neighbouring links and plaquettes .",
    "this is what is meant by locality. in figure  [ fig_indices2 ] we show the lattice point @xmath199 together with the @xmath200 links and @xmath201 plaquettes which contain @xmath103 .",
    "the partition function finally reads @xmath202 where @xmath203 encompasses the vector index summations and projectors associated with the lattice point @xmath199 : @xmath204 the first product parameterizes all possible planes by @xmath114 .",
    "the four sums are then associated with the four plaquettes @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath112 in the @xmath198-plane which contain the point @xmath103 ( figure  [ fig_indices2 ] ) .",
    "the last product enumerates the ` outgoing ' and ` incoming ' links and contains the projectors associated with this link and with the point @xmath103 .",
    "note that the projectors in   for a given lattice point @xmath199 involve only vector indices whose summation is part of the same @xmath203 .",
    "the partition function   consists now of a sum over irreducible representations for all plaquettes and a sum over the projectors onto the trivial components in the tensor product   for all links .",
    "this tensor product involves the representations of all plaquettes which cobound the given link .",
    "in particular , if the tensor product does not contain a trivial component , this sum over projectors is empty and does not contribute to the path integral .",

    "the partition function contains furthermore a ( local ) gauge constraint factor @xmath203 , see  , for each lattice point .",
    "the two main differences to the abelian case ( see  @xcite ) are the following : firstly , in the abelian case only objects on a single level , namely the plaquettes , are coloured with integer numbers ( which characterize the finite - dimensional irreducible unitary representations ) . in the non - abelian case",
    "we have to colour the plaquettes with representations and the links with intertwiners .",
    "the configurations of the dual model are thus spin foams .",
    "note that the choice of projectors @xmath178 in   and   agrees up to canonical isomorphisms with the choice of intertwiners in the definition of a closed spin foam as given in  @xcite . here",
    "the assignment of ` incoming ' and ` outgoing ' faces has to be made according to our standard orientations of plaquettes and links .",
    "secondly , the integrand is not just a boltzmann weight , but contains in addition the factor @xmath203 for each lattice point . in the abelian case ,",

    "the plaquettes of the dual lattice are then assigned projectors onto the trivial components of some tensor product .",
    "this tensor product is the product of the representations belonging to the links in the boundary of the plaquette .    instead of the projectors onto trivial components ,",
    "schematically @xmath233 we now write intertwiners @xmath234 using the isomorphisms of @xmath0-modules @xmath235 .",
    "the intertwiners @xmath236 thus map from two links of a given plaquette to the other two links .",

    "are represented by double arrows leading from two links of each plaquette to the other two links .",
    "the arrows illustrate how the intertwiners have to be composed to account for the contraction of the indices in  .",
    "the remaining indices are then summed over .",
    "a similar visualization is straight forward for the factors @xmath239 in  .",
    "in this section we show how theorem  [ thm_dualpartition1 ] reduces to the well - known results for @xmath4 .",
    "similar calculations are available for @xmath5 or @xmath6 ( note that the transformation is applicable to @xmath5 although @xmath5 is neither compact nor finite .",
    "this is because @xmath5 gauge theory is dual to @xmath7 gauge theory ) .",
    "we start with the dual partition function  .",
    "the unitary finite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath7 are all one - dimensional .",
    "they are given by homomorphisms @xmath240 for @xmath241 and are characterized by integer numbers @xmath242 ,  @xmath155 .",
    "the dual representation is then given by @xmath243 .",
    "consider the tensor product   and specify the representations by integer numbers @xmath244 . since all irreducible representations are one - dimensional , so are their tensor products .",
    "the question is therefore just whether or not the tensor product   is equivalent to the trivial representation .",
    "this is the case if and only if @xmath245 in this case , there is exactly one projector onto a trivial component of the tensor product which is the identity map .",
    "if   does not hold , there is no such projector .",
    "furthermore , since all irreducible representations are one - dimensional , the summations in the constraints @xmath203 , see  , disappear . moreover , the projectors @xmath246 do not have indices and are all equal to @xmath247 if they exist .",
    "thus @xmath248 if   holds .",
    "the partition function   therefore reads for @xmath4 , @xmath249 here we have used the notation @xmath250 for @xmath251 .",
    "the dual path integral thus reduces to the summation over the integer numbers for each plaquette while the dual boltzmann weight is again given by the character decomposition of the original boltzmann weight , @xmath252 the @xmath253-constraint ensures that the integer @xmath3-form @xmath254 is co - closed .",
    "this condition provides the dual model with the properties of a gauge theory . as is well - known",
    ", the partition function   describes the dual of @xmath7 lattice gauge theory , the so - called @xmath5 gauge theory  @xcite and is here presented on the original rather than on the dual lattice .      in this section",
    "we demonstrate how theorem  [ thm_dualpartition1 ] reduces to the familiar result for non - abelian lattice gauge theory in @xmath255 . in this case",
    "the partition function is particularly simple .",
    "we start again with the dual partition function  . in @xmath255",
    ", there are only two plaquettes which cobound a given link @xmath117 .",
    "imagine the situation of figure  [ fig_linkplaqu ] in @xmath255 .",
    "the tensor product   therefore consists of only two factors .",
    "it reads for links @xmath256 in the @xmath247-direction , @xmath257 and for links @xmath258 in the @xmath3 direction , @xmath259 here we have suppressed the last two indices of @xmath260 which are always @xmath261 and @xmath262 . in both cases   and  ,",
    "there are trivial components in the tensor product if and only if @xmath263 since this holds for all @xmath199 , the only contributions to the partition function are given by configurations which assign the same representation to all plaquettes .",
    "we thus have @xmath264 observe further that the projectors onto the trivial component in the tensor products   and   are both given by the trace ,  @xmath265 .",
    "the constraint @xmath203 can be easily calculated : @xmath266 therefore the partition function reads @xmath267 this is the well - known result for lattice gauge theory in two dimensions , see  @xcite .",
    "the duality transformation given in theorems  [ thm_dualpartition1 ] and  [ thm_dualwilson1 ] is a strong - weak duality .",
    "for example , the character decomposition of the boltzmann weight   reads for the wilson action of @xmath4 , @xmath268 and for the wilson action of @xmath269 using the fundamental representation , @xmath270 here the representations are parameterized by integers @xmath108 resp.non-negative half - integers @xmath89 , and @xmath271 denote the modified bessel functions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath272 resp .",
    "@xmath273 are positive and can thus be written @xmath274 resp.@xmath275 .",
    "the @xmath132-dependence of the dual action @xmath276 is such that high and low temperature regimes are exchanged or , in the language of gauge theory , strong and weak coupling ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the coupling constant does not occur as a prefactor of the interaction terms of the dual model because its interactions do not arise from the dual boltzmann weight but rather from the selection of projectors @xmath178 and from the factors @xmath203 ,  . for details about the character decompositions of the various common actions in lattice gauge theory ,",
    "see  @xcite and references therein .    of course , it is also possible to define the action of non - abelian lattice gauge theory in terms of the character decomposition of its boltzmann weight .",
    "for example , the _ heat kernel action _ ( or generalized villain action ) is given by the choice @xmath277 which makes the strong - weak duality manifest . here",
    "@xmath278 denotes the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir operator ( in a certain normalization ) on the irreducible representation @xmath131 of @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath278 is essentially quadratic in the highest weight of the representation @xmath131 , it is apparent that higher representations are exponentially suppressed in the dual path integral .",
    "the smaller @xmath132 is chosen , the more pronounced is the suppression .",
    "the dual expressions   and   can therefore serve as generating functions for the strong coupling expansion . for details about strong coupling expansion techniques , see  @xcite .",
    "since the duality transformation for non - abelian lattice gauge theory constructed in this paper generalizes the abelian case in the form written with an explicit gauge constraint rather than in the form which is integrated and exhibits gauge degrees of freedom , there is no immediate answer to the question whether the dual model has any gauge invariance and how these degrees of freedom could be parametrized .",
    "a non - abelian generalization of the integration of a closed ( and exact ) @xmath108-cocycle to the coboundary of a @xmath279-cocycle up to a gauge freedom is not easy to find .",
    "if it exists , this paper might help to assemble information on how a non - abelian generalization of cohomology might look like .",
    "interesting in this context are the ideas developed in  @xcite .",
    "degrees of freedom in the dual model which are always present , are related to the choice of unitary representatives @xmath17 of each class of equivalent irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "the clebsh - gordan coefficients which enter the analysis extensively as the coefficients of the various projectors , depend on these choices .    in any case",
    ", the dual model can be expected to be the appropriate starting point to search for the non - abelian magnetic degrees of freedom which generalize the magnetic monopoles of @xmath7 lattice gauge theory , and to provide a framework for a rigorous treatment of their properties .",
    "as far as the strong coupling expansion is concerned , the crucial question is to what extent the limit of this expansion is compatible with the continuum limit ,  whether properties derived via the strong coupling expansion hold ( at least qualitatively ) for all couplings .",
