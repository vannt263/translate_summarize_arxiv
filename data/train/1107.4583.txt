    "quantifying the space density of low - mass black holes ( bhs ) in the local universe has important implications for predicting gravity wave signals @xcite , for understanding formation channels for seed bhs @xcite , and for testing simulations of gravitational wave recoil @xcite .",
    "moreover , establishing the existence or break - down of scaling relations between central bhs and galaxies at the low - mass end will help identify the physical processes driving the relation between bh mass @xmath5 and stellar velocity dispersion @xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    planned nir telescopes in the 30 m class will eventually offer access to bhs with @xmath7 in the local universe @xcite .",
    "but lower - mass bhs will remain difficult to find , as their observational signature on surrounding stars is limited to a prohibitively small spatial scale beyond the local group .",
    "we refer to these systems as intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , since they occupy the gap in mass between the well - studied stellar - mass bhs with @xmath8 and the well - established bhs with @xmath7 .",
    "bh masses of order @xmath9 have been estimated for two globular clusters , namely g1 in m31 @xcite and @xmath10  cen in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "both estimates have been controversial . for g1 the objections of @xcite",
    "were countered by @xcite . for @xmath10",
    "cen @xcite provide a contradicting mass upper limit .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of stellar density and kinematic cusps in m54 ( ngc6715 ) , a globular cluster at a distance of 26.3 kpc in the center of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "ibata et al . interpreted their findings as possible evidence for a central bh with @xmath11 , similar to g1 and possibly similar to @xmath10  cen .",
    "but ibata et al . also noted that the orbits of the cusp stars in m54 could have moderate radial anisotropies .",
    "they demonstrated that the strong density gradient in a cusp could impede isotropic orbits from being established , contrary to the common view that isotropic orbits always arise when cluster relaxation times are relatively short .",
    "if such anisotropic orbits are present , they could mimic the signature of a central imbh .",
    "the interpretation of m54 s cusp data is thus ambiguous , and other lines of evidence for , or against , an imbh should be sought .",
    "simulations suggest a globular cluster with primordial binary stars can achieve a ratio of core to half - mass radius of only 0.08 or less , whereas larger ratios can be realized by adding an imbh @xcite . for m54",
    "this ratio is about 0.2 @xcite .",
    "also , simulations of massive disk galaxies suggest that several tidally - stripped cores of dwarf satellites could retain their imbhs @xcite .",
    "this fits in with m54 s location in the center of the disrupting sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "radiative signatures of accretion onto m54 s candidate imbh could bolster the case for its existence .",
    "@xcite detected several _",
    "sources within m54 s half - mass radius and suggested , based on the sources x - ray luminosities and colors , that they were cataclysmic variables or low - mass x - ray binaries . however , they noted that one possibly - blended source , x - ray i d 2 , was located within 1 ( 0.13 pc ) of the center of the stellar density , taken a proxy for the center of mass .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that x - ray i d 2 could be the counterpart to the candidate imbh in m54 .    in this paper",
    ", we compare recent subarcsecond astrometry for the stellar density center @xcite to improved astrometry for x - ray i d 2 @xcite , ruling out an x - ray counterpart to the candidate imbh .",
    "we also present new photometry of m54 with the nrao very large array ( vla ) @xcite , detecting neither the candidate imbh nor any stellar emitters within the cluster s half - mass radius .",

    "if the position error radius for the @xcite astrometry is dominated by the absolute accuracy of 0.6 at the 90% confidence limit , the @xcite positions for x - ray ids 1 - 6 agree with those reported in table 1 .",

    "after calibration , each day s visibility data for m54 were concatenated .",

    "the vla and _ chandra _ positions agree within their combined errors , offering an independent validation of the x - ray astrometry .",
    "the energy equipartion argument of @xcite implies that the candidate imbh in m54 , with mass @xmath17 @xcite , should coincide with the cluster s center of mass to within 0.18 ( 0.02 pc ) .",
    "using the center of the stellar density as a proxy for the center of mass , the position of the candidate imbh will be indistinguishable from those for the stellar density center reported in table 1 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the best position for the candidate imbh is that provided by @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the locations of the innermost cluster components in table 1 .",
    "the positions for the stellar density center @xcite and x - ray i d 2 are offset by 1.7 ( 0.22 pc ) .",
    "the quadratic sum of the 1 @xmath4 error in the stellar astrometry ( 0.1 ) and the x - ray astrometry ( 0.23 ) is about 0.25 .",
    "this leads to a normalized offset of @xmath18 , larger than the upper limit of 3 signifying positional coincidence @xcite .",
    "thus x - ray i d 2 coincides neither with the stellar density center nor , by the reasoning above , with the candidate imbh . although x - ray i d 2 is spatially resolved , its radial extent does not significantly alter this conclusion .",
    "this astrometric result for x - ray i d 2 is consistent with its luminosity and colors indicating a possible blend of cataclysmic variables or low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite .    adopting the unabsorbed flux limit and",
    "power - law index quoted in @xcite , the candidate imbh in m54 has a luminosity of @xmath19  ergs  s@xmath3 and an eddington ratio of @xmath20 .",
    "this latter limit is similar to the limit of @xmath21 reported by @xcite for the candidate imbh in m15 . in constrast ,",
    "the candidate imbh in g1 has a considerably higher eddington ratio of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "if an imbh exists in m54 , its accretion state resembles that of the candidate imbh in m15 rather than that of g1 .",
    "interestingly , emerging evidence suggests that accreting bhs in active galactic nuclei might divide into `` quiescent '' and `` low '' states near an eddington ratio of about @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    for accreting bhs ,",
    "the fraction of the accretion power that emerges in the radio is a strongly increasing function of bh mass @xcite .",
    "this empirical relation among x - ray and radio luminosity and bh mass was recast for the imbh regime in equation ( 1 ) of @xcite . from that relation , for the same x - ray luminosity , a @xmath9 bh will have @xmath24 times the radio flux density of a @xmath25 bh .",
    "such a difference is well beyond the factor - of - eight uncertainty in predicting the radio flux density from the empirical relation . in the case of g1",
    ", @xcite successfully detected the flux density predicted from the dynamically measured bh mass and the x - ray luminosity . that finding effectively ruled out the possibility that the x - rays in g1 emanate from a stellar - mass bh .",
    "however , improvements in the radio versus x - ray localizations of g1 could invalidate this inference @xcite .    using the upper limit to the x - ray luminosity at the stellar density center of m54 and applying equation ( 1 ) of @xcite ,",
    "the predicted flux density near 5 ghz is less than 20 - 1000  @xmath16jy  beam@xmath3 for a @xmath0 bh and 0.1 - 5  @xmath16jy  beam@xmath3 for a @xmath25 bh . from figure 2 ,",
    "the 8.5-ghz flux density is less than 51  @xmath16jy  beam@xmath3 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath26  ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "detection of a 10  @xmath16jy source at the stellar density center of m54 could help distinquish between these two cases .",
    "detecting such a faint source is now feasible @xcite and would help validate the physically plausible radio predictions advocated by @xcite and @xcite . also , m54 is more distant than any other galactic globular cluster surveyed deeply for radio emission @xcite , which serves to reduce contamination from low - luminosity stellar emitters .",

    "the mjy - level sources within m54 s limiting radius have x - ray counterparts , inconsistent with being planetary nebulae .      because of m54 s low galactic latitude and distance @xcite , it is difficult to constrain its intracluster medium and thus the fuel available to the candidate imbh .",
