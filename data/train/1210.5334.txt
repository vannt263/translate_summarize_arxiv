    "( [ guphamil ] ) . as mentioned before , this representation is naturally perturbative that is apparent from eq .  ( [ schro ] ) .    note that for an operator @xmath56 which is `` formally '' self - adjoint ( @xmath44 ) such as ( [ pp0 ] ) and ( [ pp2 ] ) , this does not prove that @xmath56 is truly self - adjoint because in general the domains @xmath57 and @xmath58 may be different . the operator @xmath56 with dense domain @xmath57 is said to be self - adjoint if @xmath59 and @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , the position operator ( [ pp0 ] ) is merely symmetric in this representation , but not self - adjoint . to see this point ,",
    "notice that in this representation and in momentum space , the wave function @xmath60 have to vanish at the boundaries of the @xmath52 interval @xmath61 .",
    "so @xmath48 is now the derivative operator @xmath62 on an interval with dirichlet boundary conditions . but",
    "this means that @xmath48 can not be self - adjoint because all candidates for the eigenfunctions of @xmath48 ( the plane waves ) are not in the domain of @xmath48 because they do not obey the dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "calculating the domain of the adjoint of @xmath48 shows that it is larger than that of @xmath48 , so @xmath48 is not a true self - adjoint operator , i.e. , @xmath63 now since @xmath60 vanishes at @xmath64 , @xmath65 can take any arbitrary value there .",
    "therefore , although its adjoint @xmath66 has the same formal expression , it acts on a different space of functions , namely @xmath67 to better clarify this point , we can also use the the von neumann s theorem @xcite .",
    "thus , we need to find the wave functions that satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath68 the solutions are @xmath69 since both @xmath70 belong to @xmath71 , the deficiency indices are @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the position operator is not self - adjoint but has a one - parameter family of self - adjoint extensions which is in agreement with the previous result .      in ordinary quantum mechanics , the free particle wave function @xmath73 is defined as the eigenfunction of the momentum operator , namely @xmath74 where @xmath52 is the eigenvalue . since the momentum operator in position space is given by @xmath75",
    ", we have @xmath76 which has the following solution @xmath77 where the constant of integration is chosen to satisfy @xmath78 in the gup scenario , to find the momentum eigenfunction in position space , we write the eigenvalue equation as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the eigenvalue of @xmath49 .",
    "now , let us take the solution in the form of eq .",
    "( [ solp ] ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 . inserting this solution in eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) results in @xmath83 or @xmath84 so we have @xmath85.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the eigenfunctions are normalizable @xmath86 therefore @xmath87.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the momentum eigenfunctions now satisfy @xmath88 finally , since @xmath89 , the energy of the free particle @xmath90 is bounded from above @xmath91    to find eq .",
    "( [ sol - n ] ) we supposed that the coefficient @xmath92 does not depend on the momentum .",
    "if we relax this assumption , the maximally localized states can be used to find the quasiposition wave function of the momentum eigenstate @xmath93 in a straightforward way .",
    "so inserting @xmath94 in eq .",

    ". however , for this case the solutions are no longer the eigenfunctions of the position operator which is the consequence of non - self - adjointness property of the position operator .",
    "thus , in comparison , eq .  ( [ qp - sol ] ) represents the physically acceptable solutions .      as another application ,",
    "let us consider a particle with mass @xmath97 confined in an infinite one - dimensional box with length @xmath98 @xmath99 the corresponding eigenfunctions should satisfy the following generalized schrdinger equation @xmath100 for @xmath101 and they also meet the boundary conditions @xmath102 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the above equation is thoroughly solved to @xmath103 and its exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are found .",
    "because of the boundary conditions , if we take the normalized ansatz @xmath104 eq .",

    "therefore , to first order of gup parameter we have @xmath109 which is in agreement with the result of ref .",
    "these results show that in this gup scenario there is no change in the particle in a box eigenfunctions but there is a positive shift in the energy spectrum which is proportional to the powers of @xmath4 .",
    "we now estimate the energy spectrum using the semiclassical scheme . for the particle in a box , the wilson - sommerfeld formula @xmath110 results in @xmath111",
    "since the high energy momentum @xmath49 depends on the low energy momentum through @xmath112 ( [ pp ] ) , the semiclassical energy spectrum is given by @xmath113 ^ 2\\hspace{-.3cm}.\\hspace{.75cm}\\label{sme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to check that the semiclassical result ( [ sme ] ) exactly coincide with the quantum mechanical spectrum ( [ ebox ] ) .",
    "therefore , the number of states is finite @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the largest integer not greater than @xmath116 , and the maximal energy of the particle in a box reads @xmath91 so we found that this upper bound is similar to the case of the free particle .",
    "however , note that because of the presence of the maximum momentum @xmath117 this result is not surprising . indeed for both cases we have @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , for the case of the harmonic oscillator , the maximal semiclassical energy is @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "this value can be roughly estimated if we associate the same amount of energy to both kinetic and potential parts of the hamiltonian , namely @xmath120 .",
    "it is now worth mentioning that the existence of the upper bound on the energy spectrum in the gup scenario is also addressed by quesne and tkachuk in the context of lorentz - covariant deformed algebra with minimal length when it is applied to the @xmath121-dimensional dirac oscillator @xcite . for that case",
    "the energy spectrum reads @xmath122 where @xmath97 and @xmath123 are the oscillator s mass and frequency , respectively .",
    "therefore both the deformation parameter and the energy spectrum are bounded from above , i.e. , @xmath124 ) , @xmath125 is not bounded and ranges from zero to infinity . however , there is no restriction on @xmath4 in our formulation in contrary to the covariant version of the kmm algebra .      to check the validity of the wilson - sommerfeld quantization rule for this modified quantum mechanics , we need to show that the zeroth - order wave function , which satisfies the generalized schrdinger equation ( [ schro ] ) , can be written as @xmath126 $ ]",
    "so let us take @xmath127 where @xmath128 can be expanded as a power series in @xmath129 in the semiclassical approximation , i.e. , @xmath130 so we have @xmath131 where the prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath116 .",

    "we now extend the developed formalism in previous sections to @xmath0 spatial dimensions .",
    "we then present the generalized poisson brackets in the classical limit and study the density of states .",

    "this fact changes the momentum dependence of the density of states and affects the calculation of cosmological constant , blackbody radiation spectrum , etc .",
    "similar to the kmm algebra @xcite , we should check that any volume of the phase space evolves such that the number of states inside it does not change with respect to time as the analog of the liouville theorem .",

    "<S> in a recent paper , we presented a nonperturbative higher order generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) that is consistent with various proposals of quantum gravity such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , doubly special relativity , and predicts both a minimal length uncertainty and a maximal observable momentum . in this letter , we find exact maximally localized states and present a formally self - adjoint and naturally perturbative representation of this modified algebra </S>",
    "<S> . then we extend this gup to @xmath0 dimensions that will be shown it is noncommutative and find invariant density of states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the presence of the maximal momentum results in upper bounds on the energy spectrum of the free particle and the particle in box . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this form of gup modifies blackbody radiation spectrum at high frequencies and predicts a finite cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> although it does not solve the cosmological constant problem , it gives a better estimation with respect to the presence of just the minimal length .    </S>",
