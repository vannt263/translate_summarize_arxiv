    ", one can ask if this stabilization phenomenon arises to exotic surfaces with higher genus .    while a great deal of exotic embeddings in @xmath0-manifolds are known through various constructions  @xcite , interestingly most examples of exotic embeddings for oriented surfaces in simply - connected @xmath0-manifolds derive from the constructions based on ` knot surgery ' of fintushel - stern  @xcite .",

    "in fact , all known examples need only one stabilization to be diffeomorphic .",

    "rim surgery of fintushel and stern  @xcite constructed an infinite family of exotic smooth embedding for surfaces with simply - connected complements in a simply - connected @xmath0-manifold .",
    "finashin used annulus rim surgery  @xcite for knotting algebraic curves in @xmath21 , and produced surfaces that are smoothly not isotopic to algebraic curves for degree @xmath22 , but the topological classification of his examples was open .",
    "the later work  @xcite of the author introduced a method , called twist rim surgery , of knotting surfaces that produced exotic embeddings for surfaces with cyclic knot groups in a simply - connected @xmath0-manifold . applied to algebraic curves in @xmath21 , the twist rim surgery leads to the construction of infinitely many exotic smooth structures on algebraic curves of degree @xmath23 . for degrees @xmath16 and @xmath8 , the surfaces are spheres , and it is not easy to distinguish these by seiberg - witten invariants .",
    "the work of ruberman and author  @xcite strengthened the criterion from  @xcite for topological equivalence of surfaces by showing that any surfaces produced by a knot surgery that preserve a cyclic knot group is topologically standard .",
    "as a consequence , we deduced that finashin s examples are topologically standard . despite some results about the existence of symplectic , noncomplex surfaces as well as smooth surfaces without symplectic structures , the main classical source of examples for smooth embeddings codimension @xmath8 had been complex curves . a subsequent work  @xcite extended gompf s theorem about the fundamental group of symplectic manifolds to the relative case , showing that any finitely presented group can be realized as the fundamental group of complement of a symplectic surface in a simply - connected symplectic @xmath0-manifold , whereas the fundamental groups of complement of complex curves are quite restricted .",
    "those examples can be further smoothly knotted by twist rim surgery so that it has led to a large class of exotic embeddings .",
    "another interesting aspect of twist rim surgery is that some iteration of the twist rim surgery gives a way of constructing new smooth surfaces with certain non - abelian finite surface knot group .",
    "one consequence is that it gave an infinite family of exotic surfaces in @xmath24 with knot group a dihedral group @xmath25 , for any odd @xmath26 .    in this paper , we prove that for all known examples of surface knots constructed from rim surgery , twisted rim surgery , and annulus rim surgery that preserve their surface knot groups , they become pairwise diffeomorphic after ` single ' stabilization by @xmath6 .",
    "another result includes an interesting phenomenon in the relative version of stabilization i.e. connected sum with @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "it is known that for a nonspin simply - connected @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 , essentially due to wall  @xcite , @xmath27 is diffeomorphic to @xmath28 , but surprisingly it is not true for the relative case .",

    "note that here we will not impose any extra assumptions on @xmath2 other than that @xmath2 is an oriented smoothly embedded surface in a simply - connected closed @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 .",
    "recall that the constructions of ( twisted ) rim surgery and annulus rim surgery can provide exotic embeddings of @xmath2 when @xmath2 is a surface of positive genus and @xmath4 has a non - trivial relative seiberg - witten invariant  @xcite ( or a relative heegaard - floer invariant as in the version of mark  @xcite ) .",
    "the main theorems are precisely stated in the next section where it carefully describes when surface knot groups are preserved for each knotting construction . and",
    "it includes the proof of theorem  [ t : mainthmd ] .",
    "before we state our results , the notions of ` equivalence ' of embeddings of surfaces in a @xmath36 should be clarified as in  @xcite :    [ d : equivalencesurfaces ] two smoothly embedded surfaces @xmath37 in a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath38 are _ equivalent _ if there is an orientation preserving pairwise diffeomorphism of @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",

    "we assume that @xmath1 is a smooth simply - connected closed @xmath0-manifold , and @xmath2 is an oriented embedded surface in @xmath1 throughout the paper .",
    "then the fundamental group @xmath57 is normally generated by a meridian @xmath58 of surface . for a surface @xmath2 carrying a non - trivial homology class in @xmath1 , the first homology group @xmath59 is always finite cyclic , of order that we will usually write as @xmath29 .",
    "the process of knotting an embedded surface @xmath2 in @xmath1 can be obtained by performing knot surgery on a torus in the exterior @xmath60 , that usually links with @xmath2 in a simply way , and then gluing back in the neighborhood of the surface gives a new embedding of @xmath2 in @xmath61 with image @xmath20 . in the case of rim surgery , twist rim surgery , and annulus rim surgery , there is a canonical identification between @xmath1 and @xmath61 so that we can view @xmath20 as an embedding in @xmath1 ; see  section  [ s : prelim ] for more details of these constructions .",
