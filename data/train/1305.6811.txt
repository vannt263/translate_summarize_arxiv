    "icecube is a km@xmath2-scale cherenkov detector deployed in the glacial ice at the geographic south pole .",
    "its primary goal is to search for astrophysical sources of high - energy neutrinos .",
    "a major background for this search is the high rate of atmospheric muons produced when cosmic rays with energies above a few tev interact with the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the rate of muon events in icecube above several hundred gev dominates the total trigger rate of the detector , and is approximately six orders of magnitude higher than the rate of neutrino - induced events .",
    "the incoming direction of multi - tev cosmic muons is on average within 0.1@xmath3 of arrival direction of the primary cosmic - ray particle  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the distribution of incoming muons should mimic the almost isotropic distribution of tev cosmic rays in the sky @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the angular distribution of cosmic rays is the presence of a relative deficit in the flux of cosmic rays coming from the direction of the moon .",
    "this effect , due to the absorption of cosmic rays by the moon , was first predicted by clark in 1957 @xcite , and its observation has been used by several experiments as a way of calibrating the angular resolution and the pointing accuracy of their particle detectors ( see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite for recent results . )    for icecube , the moon shadow analysis is a vital and unique verification tool for the track reconstruction algorithms that are used in the search for point - like sources of astrophysical neutrinos @xcite , among other analyses . in this paper",
    "we will report on the observation of the moon shadow using data taken between april 2008 and may 2010 , before the completion of the icecube neutrino observatory in december 2010 .",
    "two independent analysis methods were used in the search for the moon shadow .",
    "the first analysis performs a binned , one - dimensional search for the moon shadow that compares the number of events detected from the direction of the moon to the number of background events recorded at the same declination as the moon but at a different right ascension .",
    "the second method uses an unbinned , two - dimensional maximum likelihood algorithm that retrieves the best fit value for the total number of events shadowed by the moon .",
    "both methods show consistent results , and constitute the first statistically significant detection of the shadow of the moon using a high - energy neutrino telescope .",
    "the icecube neutrino telescope uses the deep antarctic ice as a detection medium .",
    "high - energy neutrinos that interact with nucleons in the ice produce relativistic leptons that emit cherenkov radiation as they propagate through the detector volume .",
    "this cherenkov light is detected by a volumetric array of 5160 digital optical modules ( doms ) deployed at depths between 1450 m and 2450 m below the ice surface .",
    "each dom consists of a 25 cm diameter photomultiplier tube ( pmt )  @xcite and the electronics for signal digitization  @xcite housed inside a pressure - resistant glass sphere .",
    "the doms are attached to 86 strings that provide mechanical support , electrical power , and a data connection to the surface .",
    "consecutive doms in each string are vertically separated by a distance of about 17 m , while the horizontal spacing between strings is about 125 m. a compact group of eight strings with a smaller spacing between doms is located at the bottom of the detector and forms deepcore  @xcite , which is designed to extend the energy reach of icecube to lower neutrino energies .",
    "the icetop surface array , devoted to the detection of extensive air showers from cosmic rays with energies between 300 tev and 1 eev , completes the instrumentation of the observatory .",
    "the construction of icecube began in 2005 and was completed in december 2010 . during construction ,",
    "the detector operated in several partial configurations .",
    "data from two different configurations were used in this paper : between 2008 and 2009 the detector operated with 40 strings deployed in the ice ( ic40 ) , and between 2009 and 2010 the detector operated in its 59-string configuration ( ic59 ) .",
    "the layout of the two detector configurations used in this work can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : ic40_ic59_layout ] .",
    "axis ( grid north ) is aligned with the greenwich prime meridian.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]      in order to reduce the rate of noise - induced events , icecube doms are operated in a coincidence mode called hard local coincidence ( hlc ) . during the operation of ic40 and",
    "ic59 the hlc requirement was met if photon hits were detected within a @xmath4s window in two nearest neighbor or next - to - nearest neighbor doms .",
    "the detection of hlc hits leads to a full readout and transmission to the surface of the digitized pmt signals .",
    "a trigger condition is then used to combine these photon hits into a candidate event .",
    "the main trigger in icecube is a simple multiplicity trigger called smt8 that requires hlc hits in eight doms within 5 @xmath5s . for each trigger ,",
    "all hlc hits within a @xmath6s window are recorded and merged into a single event .",
    "the majority of events detected by icecube are due to down - going muons produced in the interaction of high energy cosmic rays with the earth s atmosphere . during the operation of ic40 , the cosmic muon - induced trigger rate was about 1.1 khz , which increased to about 1.7 khz during the ic59 data - taking period .",
    "this high rate of cosmic - ray muon events provides a high - statistics data set that can be used to search for the moon shadow .",
    "since the rate of data transfer from the south pole via the south pole archival and data exchange ( spade ) satellite communication system is limited to about 100 gb per day , only a limited number of muon events can be transmitted to north over the satellite . for this reason",
    ", the data used in this analysis were taken using a dedicated online filter that selects only events passing minimum quality cuts and reconstructed within a predefined angular acceptance window around the moon .",
    "a fast likelihood - based muon track reconstruction @xcite is performed at the south pole to obtain the arrival direction of each event .",
    "the reconstructed direction of the muon track is then compared to the position of the moon in the sky , which is calculated using the publicly - available ` slalib`library of astronomical routines @xcite .",
    "an event satisfies the moon filter selection criterium if at least 12 doms in 3 different strings record photon hits , and if the reconstructed direction is within 10@xmath7 of the moon position in declination and 40@xmath8 in right ascension ( where @xmath9 is the declination of the event and the cosine factor accounts for projection effects . )    the filter is enabled when the moon is at least @xmath10 above the horizon . due to the particular geographic location of icecube at the south pole ,",
    "the moon rises above this threshold only once per month , as its elevation above the horizon changes slowly over the course of days .",
    "since the number of muon events recorded by icecube is a strong function of the elevation angle , the rate of events that pass the acceptance window condition changes during this period as this window follows the apparent motion of the moon at the south pole . the strong correlation between moon elevation and rate of events passing the moon filter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rateplot ] .",
    "the maximum event rate is also modulated over a longer time scale of 18.6 years ( known as the lunar draconic period @xcite ) in which the maximum elevation of the moon above the horizon at the south pole oscillates between the extreme values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the maximum moon elevation during the ic40 data - taking period was @xmath13 , while for ic59 was @xmath14 .",
    "approximately @xmath15 muon events passing the moon filter condition were recorded during the ic40 data - taking period , and about @xmath16 events were recorded during the operation of the ic59 configuration .",
    "once these events have been transferred from the south pole , an iterative maximum - likelihood reconstruction algorithm is applied to the data set to obtain a more precise track direction @xcite .",
    "the algorithm also determines the angular uncertainty in the reconstructed track direction by mapping the likelihood space around the best track solution and fitting it with a paraboloid function @xcite .",
    "a narrow paraboloid indicates a precise reconstruction , while a wide paraboloid indicates a larger uncertainty in the reconstructed direction of the muon track .",
    "the @xmath17 contour line of the paraboloid function defines an error ellipse for the reconstructed direction of the track . in this analysis ,",
    "a single , one dimensional estimator of the uncertainty is obtained by calculating the rms value of the semi - major axes of that error ellipse .    the likelihood - based track reconstruction algorithm used in this work",
    "is based on the leading - edge times of the first light pulses recorded by each dom . for the fast track reconstruction at the south pole",
    "the single - photo - electron ( spe ) fit is used . in this fit",
    ", the likelihood that the first photon arrived at the pulse leading - edge times is maximized .",
    "the photons arriving at later times are ignored .",
    "neutrino point source searches rely on the multi - photo - electron ( mpe ) fit . in the mpe fit",
    ", the total number of photo - electrons @xmath18 in each dom @xmath19 is taken into account by multiplying the likelihood that a photon was detected at the first leading edge time with the probability that the remaining @xmath20 photons arrived later @xcite . for bright , i.e. high - energy , events in simulated data the mpe fit results in a slightly better angular resolution than the spe fit . also the number of direct ( unscattered ) photons associated with the reconstructed track tends to be larger with the mpe fit than with the spe fit .",
    "this makes this quantity as well as related quantities more effective for selecting well - reconstructed events .",
    "the mpe fit is discussed further in section  [ subsubsec : mperesults ] .",
    "the track reconstruction algorithms use the local detector coordinate system and the direction of a reconstructed track is given as a zenith and azimuth angle . using the event times as recorded by the data acquisition system these",
    "are transformed into a right ascension @xmath21 and declination @xmath22 , which are the more natural variables for searches of neutrino point - like sources .",
    "the muons produced in the interaction between the cosmic rays and the atmosphere must traverse several kilometers of ice before reaching the icecube detector , losing energy in the process .",
    "this sets a lower limit of several hundred gev on the energy of the muons at ground level that would trigger the detector . by extension , the primary cosmic - ray particle needed to produce this kind of muon should have an energy of at least several tev . in the following",
    ", we will refer to the energy of the primary cosmic ray , not the muons , unless specified otherwise .",
    "given that this analysis deals with cosmic - ray showers near the energy threshold of the detector , the number of muons produced in each shower that reach the detector is small .",
    "most events in the moon data sample are composed of one or two energetic muons , and only 2% of the events have muon multiplicities higher than ten .    the detailed energy scale for the ic40 and ic59 data sets was determined using simulated cosmic ray air showers created with the corsika monte carlo code  @xcite using the sibyll model of high - energy hadronic interactions @xcite . the chemical composition and spectral shape of the cosmic rays generated in this simulation",
    "follow the polygonato model @xcite .    from these simulations",
    ", we estimate that the median energy of the primary cosmic rays that trigger the icecube detector is 20 tev , while the median energy of events that satisfy the moon filter condition is about 40 tev for both ic40 and ic59 , with 68% of the events between 10 tev and 200 tev .",
    "the increased median energy of the filtered sample is due to the greater average zenith angles of the cosmic rays that pass the filter , which requires primary particles with enough energy to produce muons able to traverse more ice and trigger icecube .",
    "the muons produced by cosmic rays passing the moon filter have a mean energy of about 2 tev at ground level and reach the detector with a mean energy of 200 gev .",
    ".the ic40 configuration shows a similar energy response.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the energy spectrum of all primary cosmic rays triggering the icecube detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ic59_spectrum ] and compared to the spectrum of those that pass the moon filter . also shown in the figure",
    "are the five main chemical elements ( protons , he , c , o , and fe ) that make more than 95% of the moon filter data sample assuming the polygonato composition model . the two main components of the sample are proton ( 68% of the events ) and helium ( 23% ) .",
    "cosmic rays with tev energies should experience a small deflection in their trajectories due to the influence of the magnetic field of the earth as they propagate towards the detector .",
    "this deflection would appear in the moon shadow analysis as a shift in the position of the shadow with respect to the true moon position , which could be wrongly interpreted as a systematic offset produced by the event reconstruction .    in order to quantify this offset and compare it with any possible shift observed in the data ,",
    "we have developed a particle propagation code that can be used to trace cosmic rays in the geomagnetic field . using this code ,",
    "particles are propagated radially outwards from the south pole up to a a distance of 30 earth radii from the center of the earth at which point the opening angle between the initial and final velocity vectors is computed .",
    "this angle gives the magnitude of the deflection in the geomagnetic field .",
    "we use the international geomagnetic reference field ( igrf ) model @xcite to calculate deflections . in this model , the field is calculated using a truncated multipole series expansion .",
    "the current revision of the model , igrf-11 , can be used to calculate b - field values through 2015 , providing a good coverage of the time range over which the data were taken .",
    "the model is accessible through a library of ` fortran ` routines called ` geopack ` developed by n.  tsyganenko ] .",
    "the igrf-11 model describes what is known as the _ internal _ magnetic field of the earth , which is presumably produced by electric currents in the outer core of the planet and accounts for most of the total magnetic field . a weaker component , known as the _ external _ field , is produced by electrical currents in the ionosphere . the external component is not included in our calculation since it only modifies the total angular deflection by a few percent while significantly increasing the computation time needed to perform the simulation .    in our simulation ,",
    "primary cosmic rays are propagated in the direction of the moon as seen from the south pole for different times during the data taking period .",
    "the cosmic ray energy and chemical composition is sampled from the event distributions that pass the moon filter , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ic59_spectrum ] . the resulting total deflection @xmath23 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] as a function of energy for @xmath24 simulated cosmic ray particles for the five main chemical elements that contribute to the moon dataset .",
    "the energy and charge dependence of the deflection angle is evident in the plot .",
    "different bands in the plot correspond to different chemical elements .",
    "the width of each band is due to particles that were propagated in different directions in the sky ( i.e. through different regions of the earth s magnetic field ) experiencing different deflections .",
    "a power - law fit to the simulation results has been performed to estimate the deflection angle as a function of energy and charge .",
    "the fit gives a good agreement for the following expression : where @xmath25 is the cr charge in units of elementary charge @xmath26 , @xmath27 is its energy in tev , and @xmath23 is given in degrees .",
    "this expression has the same functional form as the one found in @xcite with a higher normalization in our simulation , which could be due to the difference in geographic location and other simulation details .",
    "the deflection of each cosmic ray with arrival direction @xmath28 in sidereal coordinates is calculated with respect to the position of the moon at the time of the event @xmath29 .",
    "the two coordinates that characterize the position of an event in this system are a right ascension difference @xmath30 , and a declination difference @xmath31 with respect to the nominal moon position .",
    "the median shift in right ascension @xmath32 for all cr particles in our simulation is @xmath33 , with 68% of the particles having deflection angles in the interval @xmath34 .",
    "the median shift in declination @xmath35 is consistent with @xmath36 , with 68% of the events contained in the interval @xmath37 .",
    "the cosmic - ray muons that ultimately trigger icecube are also deflected by the geomagnetic field .",
    "however , since their total track length is in the 50 - 100 km range and their energy is about 2 tev , their contribution to the total deflection angle should be at most @xmath38 .",
    "for this reason , the muon contribution has been ignored in calculating the expected total deflection angle .",
    "the main goal of the binned analysis is to obtain a profile view of the moon shadow and measure its width , which can be used as a direct estimator of the angular resolution of the event reconstruction .",
    "this is accomplished by comparing the observed number of events as a function of angular distance from the moon to an estimate of how many events would have been observed if there was no shadow .    for this comparison , the angular distance between the reconstructed muon tracks and the expected position of the moon is binned in constant increments of @xmath1 up to a maximum angular distance of @xmath39 .",
    "this defines the so - called _ on - source _ distribution of events .",
    "the same binning procedure is applied to eight _ off - source _ regions centered around points located at the same declination as the moon , but offset from it in right ascension by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , where it is assumed that the shadowing effect is negligible . the average number of counts as a function of radius for these eight _ off - source _ regions represents the expectation in the case of no moon shadow .",
    "the relative difference between the number of events in the @xmath44-th bin in the _ on - source _ region @xmath45 , and the average number of events in the same bin in the _ off - source _ regions @xmath46 is calculated using the following expression : the uncertainty in the relative difference is given by : where @xmath47 is the number of _ off - source _ regions .",
    "the distribution of relative differences as a function of angular radius from the moon constitutes a profile view of the shadow .",
    "simulation studies indicate that the point spread function ( psf ) of the detector can be approximated with a two - dimensional gaussian function .",
    "we use this approximation to obtain an estimate of the angular resolution of the track reconstruction by fitting the distribution of @xmath48 for the events in the moon data set .",
    "following @xcite , we treat the moon as a point - like cosmic ray sink that removes @xmath49 events from the muon sample , where @xmath50 is the angular radius of the moon ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 is the cosmic ray flux at the location of the moon in units of events per square degree .",
    "this deficit is smeared by the psf of our detector , which results in radially - symmetric two - dimensional gaussian distribution of shadowed events which is a function of radial distance @xmath53 from the center of the moon . integrating over the azimuthal coordinate of the symmetric gaussian distribution yields : where @xmath54 is the angular resolution of the directional reconstruction .",
    "the number of shadowed events in the @xmath44-th bin of width @xmath55 is given by the two - dimensional integral : @xmath56    the number of events @xmath57 that would have been observed in the same bin with no shadowing is @xmath58 .",
    "the ratio of equations [ ns ] and @xmath57 gives us the expected distribution of relative differences @xmath59 for a detector with a gaussian psf of angular resolution @xmath54 : this expression is used to fit the experimental data , and the resulting value of @xmath54 is compared to an estimate of the angular resolution of the data set obtained from simulation studies .",
    "our treatment ignores the finite angular size of the lunar disc , which may affect the result of the fit .",
    "however , for the expected angular resolution of the moon data set ( of order @xmath60 or less ) this effect should influence the fit value of @xmath54 only at the few - percent level .",
    "a set of cuts was developed to optimize for the statistical significance of the detection of the moon shadow . under the assumption of poisson statistics ,",
    "the relation between the significance @xmath61 , the fraction @xmath62 of events passing the cuts , and the resulting median angular resolution @xmath63 after cuts is :    the optimization of the cuts was performed on the corsika - simulated air showers described in section [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "two cut variables were used in this analysis : the angular uncertainty @xmath64 in the reconstruction of the muon track direction estimated individually for each event , and the reduced log - likelihood @xmath65 , which is the log - likelihood for the best track solution divided by the number of degrees of freedom in the fit .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom in the track fit is equal to the number of doms triggered by the event minus the number of free parameters in the fit ( five for this fit . )",
    "both @xmath65 and @xmath54 are standard cut variables used in the search for point - like sources of astrophysical neutrinos @xcite , the search for a diffuse flux of high - energy neutrinos @xcite , and several other analyses of icecube data .",
    "once the cuts have been determined , the number of events falling inside a circular search bin around the moon is compared to the number of events contained in a bin of the same angular radius for the average _ off - source _ region .",
    "the statistical significance of an observed deficit in the number of events in the search bin is calculated using the method given by @xcite .",
    "the optimal radius of the search bin @xmath66 can be found by maximizing the @xmath67 parameter in the following expression : where @xmath68 is the radius of the bin and @xmath69 is the point spread function of the detector after cuts obtained from simulations . due to its symmetry",
    ", the psf has already been integrated over the azimuthal coordinate and only the radial dependence remains .",
    "the optimization of the search bin radius is also performed using simulated corsika showers generated for each detector configuration .",

    "for both detector configurations , the observed positions of the shadow minimum show good agreement with expectations given the statistical uncertainties . an important implication of this observation is that any systematic effects introduced by the detector geometry and the event reconstruction on the absolute pointing capabilities of icecube are smaller than about @xmath1 .    the average angular resolution of both data samples was estimated by fitting a gaussian function to the shadow profile . in both cases ,",

    "this provides an indirect validation of the angular uncertainty estimator obtained from the reconstruction algorithm .",
    "this is especially relevant for the mpe analysis , where simulation studies indicate that the uncertainty estimator has to be rescaled in order to avoid underestimating the true angular error . applying this correction factor to the data results in a number of shadowed events compatible with expectation .",
