    "a variety of linear and nonlinear collective effects are known to occur in a dust - contaminated plasma ( _ dusty plasma _ , dp ) @xcite and relative theoretical research has received new impulse , since roughly a decade ago , thanks to laboratory and space dusty plasma observations .",
    "an issue of particular importance in dp research is the formation of strongly coupled dp crystals by highly charged dust grains , typically in the sheath region above a horizontal negatively biased electrode in experiments @xcite .",
    "low - frequency oscillations are known to occur @xcite in these mesoscopic dust grain quasi - lattices in the longitudinal ( @xmath0 , in - plane , acoustic mode ) , horizontal transverse ( @xmath1 , in - plane , shear mode ) and vertical transverse ( @xmath2 , off - plane , optic - like mode ) directions .",
    "various types of localized ( nonlinear ) excitations are known from solid state physics to exist in periodic chains ( _ lattices_)of interacting particles , in addition to propagating vibrations ( _ phonons _ ) , due to a mutual balance between the intrinsic nonlinearity of the medium and dispersion .",
    "such structures , usually investigated in a continuum approximation ( i.e. assuming that the typical spatial variation scale far exceeds the typical lattice scale , e.g. the lattice constant @xmath3 ) , include non - topological _ solitons _ ( pulses ) , _ kinks _ ( i.e. shocks or dislocations ) and localized modulated envelope structures ( _ envelope solitons _ ) , and generic nonlinear theories have been developed in order to investigate their relevance in different physical contexts @xcite .",
    "in addition to these ( continuum ) theories , which deliberately sacrifice discreteness in the altar of analytical tractability , attention has been paid since more than a decade ago to highly localized ( either stationary or propagating ) vibrating structures [ e.g. _ discrete breathers _ ( dbs ) , also widely referred to as _ intrinsic localized modes _ ( ilms ) ] , which owe their very existence to the lattice discreteness itself .",
    "thanks to a few pioneering works @xcite and a number of studies which followed , many aspects involved in the spontaneous formation , mobility and interaction of dbs are now elucidated , both theoretically and experimentally ; see in refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ( also see refs . @xcite , with reference to this study ) .",
    "despite the fact that nonlinearity is an inherent feature of the dust crystal dynamics ( either due to inter - grain electrostatic interactions , to the sheath environment , which is intrinsically anharmonic , or to coupling between different degrees of freedom ) , our knowledge of nonlinear mechanisms related to dust lattice modes still appears to be in a rather preliminary stage today .",
    "small amplitude localized longitudinal excitations ( described by a boussinesq equation for the longitudinal grain displacement @xmath4 , or a korteweg - devries equation for the density @xmath5 ) were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and generalized in ref .",
    "the nonlinear amplitude modulation of longitudinal and transverse ( vertical , off - plane ) dust lattice waves was recently considered in refs . @xcite and @xcite ( also see @xcite ) , respectively .",

    ", the effect of the high discreteness of dust crystals , clearly suggested by experiments @xcite , may play an important role in mechanisms like energy localization , storage and propagation and thus modify the crystal s dynamical response to external excitations ( in view of dp application design , e.g. ) . to the very best of our knowledge ,",
    "no study has been carried out , from first principles , of the relevance of db excitations with respect to dust lattice waves , apart from a preliminary investigation ( restricted to single - mode transverse dust - breathers ) , which was recently presented @xcite .",
    "this text aims in making a first analytical step towards filling this gap , by raising a number of questions which have not been addressed before .",

    "the in - plane ( longitudinal , acoustic , @xmath10 and shear , optical , @xmath1 ) degrees of freedom are assumed suppressed ; this situation is indeed today realized in appropriate experiments , where an electric potential ( via a thin wire ) @xcite or a coherent light ( laser ) impulse @xcite is used to trigger transverse dust grain oscillations , while ( a ) confinement potential(s ) ensure(s ) the chain s in - plane stability .",
    "the vertical grain displacement obeys an equation in the form @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the small displacement of the @xmath13th grain around the ( levitated ) equilibrium position @xmath14 , in the transverse ( @xmath15 ) direction .",

    "the damping coefficient @xmath21 accounts for dissipation due to collisions between dust grains and neutral atoms .",
    "the gap frequency @xmath22 and the nonlinearity coefficients @xmath23 are defined via the overall vertical force : @xmath24 \\ , + { \\cal o}[(\\delta z_n)^4 ] \\ , , \\ ] ] which has been expanded around @xmath14 by formally taking into account the ( anharmonicity of the ) local form of the sheath electric ( follow exactly the definitions in ref .",

    "is recovered @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that both experimental @xcite and ab initio ( numerical ) @xcite studies suggest that dust crystals are embedded in an _ nonlinear _ on - site ( sheath ) potential @xmath42 , in the vertical direction , which is ( possibly strongly ) asymmetric around the origin , i.e. _ not _ an _ even _ function of @xmath43 .",
    "this implies a finite value of the cubic anharmonicity parameter @xmath44 , thus invalidating models involving _ even _ potential forms ",

    "@xcite . notice the natural _ gap frequency _ @xmath54 , corresponding to an overall motion of the chain s center of mass , as well as the _ cutoff frequency _ @xmath55 ( obtained at the end of the first brillouin zone @xmath56 ) which is _ absent in the continuum limit _ , viz .",
    "@xmath57 ( for @xmath58 ) ; obviously , the study of wave propagation in this ( @xmath59 ) region invalidates the continuum treatment employed so far in literature .",
    "the essential feature of discrete dynamics , to be retained here , is the ( narrow ) bounded tdlw ( _ ` phonon ' _ ) frequency band , limited in the interval @xmath60 $ ] ; note that one thus naturally obtains the stability constraint : @xmath61 ( so that @xmath62 $ ] ) .    we need nt go into further details concerning the linear regime , since it is covered in the literature .",
    "we shall , instead , see what happens if the _ nonlinear _ terms are retained , in this discrete description .",
    "we are interested in the ( possibility for the ) existence of multi - mode breathers , i.e. localized ( discrete ) excitations in the form : @xmath63 with @xmath64 for reality and @xmath65 as @xmath66 , for localization .      inserting eq .",

    "i.e. , setting @xmath79 and @xmath80 , viz .",
    "@xmath81 : @xmath82 we see that the amplitudes @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) of the first ( zeroth ) harmonic terms , corresponding to the @xmath13th site , will be given by the iterative solution of eqs .",

    ", one needs to determine whether the fixed point of the 4-dimensional map ( [ equations - single - map ] ) [ or of the complete 4n - dimensional map corresponding to ( [ equations - multi ] ) , in general ] is hyperbolic , and examine the dimensionality of its stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "it is known @xcite that the existence of discrete breathers is associated with homoclinic orbits , implying a saddle point at the origin .",
    "let us now linearize the map ( [ equations - single - map ] ) near the fixed point @xmath88 , by setting e.g. @xmath89 , where @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
