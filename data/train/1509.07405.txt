    "the fact that the speed of physical interactions is finite , as for light or sound , has well known crucial consequences in all physics , and it is the ultimate reason for the existence of waves .",
    "for example , if we artificially assume the speed of light as infinite in the maxwell equations , the magnetic field would be zero and we would not have electromagnetic waves .    the situation is quite different when the equations contain non linear terms , which can result in erratic or even chaotic trajectories .",
    "notice that , in the absence of mechanical kinetic terms , which is our framework , the presence of non linear terms is exclusively due to the presence of non bilinear interactions among the components of the system .",
    "for example , in the kuramoto model @xcite-@xcite , sinusoidal interactions lead to chaos @xcite-@xcite if the coupling constant @xmath0 is larger than some threshold @xmath1 .    it should be emphasized that the presence of non linear terms is not always sufficient for the emergence of chaos .",
    "however , it has been observed that the introduction of time - delays among the components of a system augments the chance that the system develops chaos @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the idea at the base of such a mechanism is that time - delays among the system components makes it difficult for the system to set in a steady state . in particular , for linear flows , a fixed delay among the system components corresponds to a finite speed of interactions , which in turn leads to oscillations or waves . for",
    "non linear flows a delay can have more dramatic consequences , with chaos scenarios more probable .    in @xcite , we have introduced a simple discrete - time two components dynamical model , characterized by local - time updates .",
    "local time updates means that the each component updates its status only at certain times @xmath2 . in the specific model analyzed in @xcite ,",
    "a component updates ( sleeps ) its status only at odd times @xmath3 , ( even times @xmath4 ) , while the other component updates ( sleeps ) its status only at even times @xmath4 ( odd times @xmath3 ) .",
    "remarkably , as we have shown in @xcite , for certain coupling values , this simple system exhibits chaos even if it is characterized only by bilinear interactions .",
    "in fact , when the couplings are in the steady state regime , the system can be described via a hamiltonian which is quadratic in the system components .",
    "we are not aware of a similar case in the literature .",
    "our understanding here is that there are three factors generates chaos : _ i ) _ the presence of unfriendly couplings , _ ii ) _ the discrete - time nature of the dynamics , and _",
    "iii ) _ the existence of at least two interacting communities which rearrange their configurations at alternate times , _",
    "i.e. _ via local - time updates .",
    "notice that _",
    "( iii ) _ is not just a delay ; it also implies that each component has a sleeping period .",
    "it is during such a sleeping period that the component accumulates a tension with respect to the other component when the reciprocal coupling is unfriendly .",
    "we are in fact dealing with a sort of dynamical frustration .",
    "in this paper we review some aspects of the model which were only partially treated in @xcite . in particular , we compare the analogous flow model with the present map and show that the above conditions _ ( i)_-_(iii ) _ are in fact necessary , and calculate the maximal lyapunov exponent .",

    "here we consider a two components system .",
    "generalization to an arbitrary number of components will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we consider two communities @xcite of agents @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with cardinalities @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the agent with index @xmath9 can be in two possible status , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 . according to the sign of the couplings , friendly or unfriendly",
    ", each agent @xmath9 tends to follow or anti - follow its neighbors , by minimizing or maximizing the term @xmath12 , where @xmath13 runs over the set of neighbors of @xmath9 .",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between intra- and inter - couplings , therefore we introduce the @xmath14 matrix @xmath15 : @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the intra - couplings , and @xmath18 the inter - coupling . in the most general formulation",
    "we should introduce also the @xmath14 matrix @xmath19 defined as the set of coupled spins @xmath20 within the same community ( intra ) , or between the two communities ( inter ) . finally , we introduce a global factor @xmath21 that rescales all the couplings in @xmath22 .",
    "let us indicate the time by @xmath2 , which is supposed to range in the set of natural numbers @xmath23 for the map , while it can take any non negative real number for the flow .",
