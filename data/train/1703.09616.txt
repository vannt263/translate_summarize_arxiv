    "for a given connected graph @xmath9 and given @xmath10 , we consider the following probabilistic variant of cops and robbers , which is played over a series of discrete time - steps . in the game of",
    "_ zombies and survivors _ , suppose that @xmath11 _ zombies _ ( akin to the cops ) start the game on random vertices of @xmath9 ; each zombie , independently , selects a vertex uniformly at random to start with .",
    "then the _ survivor _ ( akin to the robber ) occupies some vertex of @xmath9 .",
    "as zombies have limited intelligence , in each round , a given zombie moves towards the survivor along a shortest path connecting them .",
    "in particular , the zombie decreases the distance from its vertex to the survivor s .",
    "if there is more than one neighbour of a given zombie that is closer to the survivor than the zombie is , then they move to one of these chosen uniformly at random .",
    "each zombie moves independently of all other zombies . as in cops and robbers ,",
    "the survivor may move to another neighbouring vertex , or _ pass _ and not move .",
    "the zombies win if one or more of them _ eat _ the survivor ; that is , land on the vertex which the survivor currently occupies .",
    "the survivor , as survivors should do in the event of a zombie attack , attempts to survive by applying an optimal strategy ; that is , a strategy that minimizes the probability of being captured .",
    "note that there is no strategy for the zombies ; they merely move on geodesics towards the survivor in each round",
    ". note that since zombies always move toward the survivor , he can pass at most @xmath12 times , where @xmath12 is a diameter of @xmath9 , before being eaten by some zombie .",
    "we note also that our probabilistic version of zombies and survivors was inspired by a deterministic version of this game ( with similar rules , but the zombies may choose their initial positions , and also choose which shortest path to the survivor they will move on ) first considered in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 be the probability that the survivor wins the game , provided that he follows the optimal strategy . clearly , @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the cop number of @xmath9 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath17 provided that there is a strategy for @xmath18 cops in which the cops always try to get closer to the robber , since with positive probability the zombies may follow such a strategy .",
    "usually , @xmath19 for any @xmath18 ; however , there are some examples of graphs for which @xmath20 for every @xmath18 ( consider , for example , trees ) .",
    "further , note that @xmath13 is a non - decreasing function of @xmath11 ( that is , for every @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , and @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "the latter limit follows since the probability that each vertex is initially occupied by at least one zombie tends to 1 as @xmath25 .",
    "define the _ zombie number _ of a graph @xmath9 by @xmath26 this parameter is well defined since @xmath27 .",
    "in other words , @xmath28 is the minimum number of zombies such that the probability that they eat the survivor is at least 1/2 .",
    "the ratio @xmath29 is the _ cost of being undead_. note that there are examples of families of graphs for which there is no cost of being undead ; that is , @xmath30 ( as is the case if @xmath9 is a tree ) , and , as argued in  @xcite , there are examples of graphs with @xmath31    this variant of the game was recently introduced in  @xcite , where several graph families were investigated , such as cycles , hypercubes , incidence graphs of projective planes , and cartesian grids . in particular , the zombie number of the incidence graphs of projective planes is about two times larger than the corresponding cop number ; for hypercubes , this ratio is asymptotically @xmath32 .",
    "it seems that the main question for this game is to investigate the zombie number for grids formed by products of cycles , @xmath33 ( so called _ toroidal grids _ ) . in  @xcite",
    ", it was proved that the zombie number of @xmath34 is at least @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is any function going to infinity as @xmath4 .",
    "the proof relies on the careful analysis of a strategy for the survivor . on the other hand , trivially ,",
    "suppose that the game is played against @xmath36 zombies .",
    "it is easy to see that a.a.s .",
    "every vertex is initially occupied by at least one zombie and if so the survivor is eaten immediately .",
    "indeed , the probability that at at least one vertex is not not occupied by a zombie is at most @xmath37 .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a general approach that gives immediately a tiny improvement , an upper bound of @xmath6 .",
    "we investigate this technique by analyzing a few natural strategies and show that this approach has no hope of giving an upper bound better than @xmath7 .",
    "however , it is quite possible that ( with more careful , deterministic , argument ) it might actually give that bound .",
    "it is left for a further investigation .",
    "on the other hand , by analyzing a specific strategy for the survivor , it seems that one could slightly improve the lower bound to @xmath8 . in any case",
    ", we are far away from understanding this intriguing question .",
    "your help is needed !",
    "let us start with a formal definition of the class of graphs we investigate in this paper . for graphs @xmath9 and @xmath38 , define the _ cartesian product _ of @xmath9 and @xmath38 , written @xmath39 to have vertices @xmath40 and",
    "vertices @xmath41 and @xmath42 are joined if @xmath43 and @xmath44 or @xmath45 and @xmath46 in this note , we consider grids formed by products of cycles .",
    "let @xmath34 be the _ toroidal grid _",
    "@xmath47 , which is isomorphic to @xmath48 for simplicity , we take the vertex set of @xmath34 to consist of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the ring of integers modulo @xmath51 .    results in the paper are asymptotic in nature as @xmath52 .",
    "we emphasize that the notations @xmath53 and @xmath54 refer to functions of @xmath51 , not necessarily positive , whose growth is bounded .",
    "we say that an event in a probability space holds _ asymptotically almost surely _ ( or _ a.a.s .",
    "_ ) if the probability that it holds tends to @xmath55 as @xmath51 goes to infinity . finally , for simplicity we will write @xmath56 if @xmath57 as @xmath4 ; that is , when @xmath58 .",
    "we are going to play the game on the toroidal grid @xmath34 .",
    "let us consider the family @xmath59 of strategies of the survivor for the first @xmath60 moves of the game . here ,",
    "a _ strategy _ is simply a sequence of moves of the survivor which is not affected neither by initial distribution of zombies nor by their behaviour during the game .",
    "moreover , we may assume that zombies do not eat the survivor immediately when they catch him ; instead , they walk with him to the end of this sequence of @xmath61 moves and then do their job .",
    "hence , since there are @xmath62 vertices to choose from for the starting position of the survivor and 5 options in each round ( `` go west '' , `` go east '' , `` go north '' , `` go south '' , and `` stay put '' ) , the number of strategies in @xmath59 is @xmath63 . finally , let @xmath64 be a subfamily of @xmath65 strategies of the survivor that finish his walk at vertex @xmath66 of @xmath34 .",
    "let us concentrate on a given strategy @xmath67 finishing at vertex @xmath41 of @xmath34 .",
    "for any @xmath68 such that @xmath69 , let @xmath70 be the probability that a zombie starting at vertex @xmath71 eats the survivor using strategy @xmath72 for the first @xmath73 moves . clearly , if a zombie starts at vertex at distance larger than @xmath73 from @xmath41 , then it is impossible for her to catch the survivor ( even intelligent player would not be able to reach @xmath41 in @xmath73 moves ! ) ; hence , in this situation @xmath74 .",
    "note also that restricting staring positions for zombies to the subgraph around @xmath41 guarantees that the survivor and zombies starting at this subgraph do not leave it during the fist @xmath73 rounds . as a result",
    ", the game during these @xmath73 rounds is played as if it was played on the square grid ( @xmath0 ) centred at @xmath41 , not the toroidal one .",
    "moreover , since @xmath34 is a vertex transitive graph , without loss of generality , we may assume that the survivor finishes his walk at vertex @xmath66 .",
    "these little observations will simplify the analysis below .",
    "finally , let @xmath75 as mentioned earlier , due to the fact that @xmath34 is vertex transitive , we have @xmath76        let @xmath79 be a sequence of independent random variables , each of them being the bernoulli random variable with parameter @xmath80 ( that is , @xmath81 for each @xmath82 ) .",
    "this ( random ) sequence will completely determine the behaviour of all the zombies .",
    "formally , let us first fix a permutation @xmath83 of @xmath11 zombies .",
    "then , in each round , we consider all zombies , one by one , using permutation @xmath83 . if there is precisely one shortest path between a given zombie and the survivor , the next move is determined",
    "; otherwise , the next random variable @xmath84 from the sequence guides it ( for example , if @xmath85 , the zombie moves horizontally ; otherwise , she moves vertically ) .",
    "our goal is to show that a.a.s .",
    "the survivor is eaten during the fist @xmath86 rounds , regardless of the strategy he uses . in order to show it ,",
    "let us pretend that the game is played on a _ real board _",
    "but , at the same time , there are @xmath87 _ auxiliary boards _ where the game is played against all strategies from @xmath59 .",
    "an important assumption is that the same sequence @xmath79 is used for all the boards .",
    "since zombies select initial vertices uniformly at random , the probability that a given zombie wins against a given strategy @xmath67 is at least @xmath88 since zombies play independently , the probability the survivor using strategy @xmath72 is not eaten during the first @xmath73 rounds is at most @xmath89 ( note that , in particular , if two zombies start at the same vertex @xmath90 , each of them catches the survivor with probability @xmath70 and the corresponding events are independent . )",
    "it follows that the expected number of auxiliary games where the survivor is not eaten is @xmath91 and so a.a.s .",
    "he loses on all auxiliary boards . as a result , a.a.s .",
    "zombies win the real game too , regardless of the strategy used by the survivor .",
    "clearly , the survivor should make decisions based on the behaviour of the zombies ( who make decisions at random and so very often behave in a sub - optimal way ) ; however , if the survivor wins the real game , at least one auxiliary game is also won by some specific strategy which we showed can not happen a.a.s .",
    "that is why we needed the trick with the sequence @xmath79 guiding all the games considered .      in this subsection",
    ", we first derive a recursive formula for calculating @xmath70 for a given strategy @xmath67 . consider any strategy @xmath67 : at the beginning of round @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , the survivor occupies vertex @xmath94",
    ", zombies make their moves and then the survivor moves to @xmath95 ; round @xmath92 is finished and round @xmath96 starts .",
    "as before , since @xmath34 is vertex transitive , without loss of generality we may restrict ourselves to a subfamily @xmath97 of strategies for the first @xmath73 moves that bring the survivor to vertex @xmath66 after @xmath73 rounds ; that is , @xmath98 .",
    "we are interested in calculating @xmath99 , the probability that a zombie occupying @xmath90 at the beginning of round @xmath92 catches the survivor using strategy @xmath72 by the end of round @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath100 . clearly , @xmath101 and @xmath102 if @xmath103 ( zombie must be at distance at most 1 from the survivor at the beginning of round @xmath73 ) .",
    "moreover , for any round @xmath104 we have the following recursive formula . if @xmath105 and @xmath106 , then @xmath107 where `` @xmath108 '' is `` @xmath109 '' or `` @xmath110 ''",
    "so that @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( zombies move towards the survivor , either horizontally or diagonally ; the decision is made uniformly at random ) .",
    "if @xmath113 and @xmath106 , then @xmath114 ( zombies move diagonally towards the survivor ) . finally , if @xmath105 and @xmath115 , then @xmath116 ( zombies move horizontally towards the survivor )",
    ".      reversing the direction , we get the following recursive relationship between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : spreading ] for an illustration . )",
    "if @xmath119 and @xmath120 , then half of the weight of @xmath117 is moved horizontally and half of it is moved vertically to the two neighbours of @xmath90 that are further away from @xmath121 .",
    "if @xmath119 but @xmath122 , then half of the weight of @xmath117 is moved vertically to both `` vertical '' neighbours of @xmath90 ; in addition to this , @xmath117 is added to the `` horizontal '' neighbour of @xmath90 that is further away from @xmath121 .",
    "we proceed in a symmetric way if @xmath123 and @xmath120 .",
    "finally , we put @xmath124        for a while , our conjecture was that @xmath126 and , as a result , @xmath127 . in order to simplify the analysis",
    ", we may project @xmath70 onto @xmath128 ; that is , we may concentrate on @xmath129 clearly , no recursive formula for getting @xmath130 from @xmath131 exists but , by setting up a simple coupling , we can get the following lower bound : @xmath132 , where @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and for each @xmath135 and @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 if @xmath139 and 0 otherwise . ( revisiting figure  [ fig : spreading ]",
    "might be helpful to see this coupling . )",
    "alternatively , one can apply a slightly weaker coupling to get : @xmath140 , where @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and for each @xmath135 and @xmath136 @xmath143 it is easy to show ( by induction ) that the difference between two consecutive terms , that is @xmath144 , is always at most 4 .",
    "indeed , the property is clearly satisfied for @xmath145 ; for @xmath135 and @xmath136 we get @xmath146 and @xmath147 in particular , it follows that the sequence @xmath148 goes up by 2 if the survivor `` pauses '' ( with respect to this projection ; that is , when @xmath149 ) and goes down by at most 2 if he `` moves '' ( that is , when @xmath150 ) .",
    "hence , if a strategy @xmath72 has the property that at some point @xmath151 there were @xmath152 more rounds when the survivor pauses than moves , then @xmath153 . since , without loss of generality , we may assume that the survivor pauses at for at least @xmath154 rounds",
    "( by projecting onto @xmath155 instead of @xmath128 if needed ) , this `` almost '' imply some nontrivial bound for @xmath156 . for a while",
    ", we were hoping to be able to show that there exists an @xmath157 such that @xmath158 which would imply @xmath159 and this in turn would imply @xmath127 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not true . based on simulations , we were able to identify that strategy ( d ) might create a problem and serve as a counterexample which turned out to be the case .",
    "we will show in the next section that the conjecture was too optimistic and , in fact , @xmath160 .",
    "but there is still a possibility that @xmath161 and so perhaps @xmath162 .",
    "consider strategy ( d ) discussed above ; that is , suppose that the survivor starts at vertex @xmath164 , where @xmath86 , and goes to @xmath66 along the diagonal ( that is , moves `` south '' and then immediately `` west '' in each pair of the two consecutive rounds ) .",
    "we will show the following result :      in order to estimate @xmath165 , we need to estimate @xmath70 for each @xmath166 such that @xmath167 . due to the symmetry",
    ", we may assume that @xmath168 .",
    "suppose that a given zombie starts the game at vertex @xmath90 .",
    "we will partition the part of the grid we investigate into 4 regions and deal with each of them separately .",
    "see figure  [ fig : strategy_d ] .",
    "let @xmath169 be some fixed , large enough , constant .",
    "region * r1 * : suppose that @xmath170 .",
    "the zombie moves randomly `` north '' or `` west '' until her position and a position of the survivor match horizontally or vertically .",
    "if they match horizontally , she will never be able to catch the survivor ",
    "the distance will be preserved till the end of the game . on the other hand ,",
    "if coordinates are matched vertically , then there is a chance .",
    "the probability of this event can be estimated ( see discussion for region  * r3 * below ) but we do not need it here ( we may use a trivial upper bound of 1 for this conditional probability ) .",
    "it is enough to notice that if the vertical match occurs , then at some point of the game a zombie moved @xmath171 more often `` west '' than she moved `` north '' .",
    "hence , @xmath172 where @xmath79 is a sequence of independent random variables , each of them being the bernoulli random variable with parameter @xmath80 , and @xmath173 .",
    "it follows that @xmath174 ( for example by converting @xmath175 into a martingale and using hoeffding - azuma inequality . )",
    "the contribution to @xmath165 from region  * r1 * is then at most @xmath176 provided that @xmath177 is large enough .",
    "region * r2 * : suppose now that @xmath178 .",
    "the zombie moves `` north '' or `` east '' , and it is expected that players match horizontally after @xmath179 rounds at which point the zombie occupies vertex @xmath180 , where @xmath181 the distance from @xmath180 to @xmath66 is @xmath182 and so @xmath183 .",
    "it follows that in order for the zombie to have a chance to win , horizontal match has to occur much later than expected . arguing as before",
    ", we can estimate the probability of this event and show that the contribution to @xmath165 from region  * r2 * is @xmath7 , provided that @xmath177 is large enough .",

    "this case seems to be the most interesting . as for the previous region",
    ", it is expected that players match horizontally when the zombie occupies vertex @xmath180 and the distance between players is @xmath187 arguing as before , we can show that with probability @xmath188 not only this happens but at that time the distance between players , @xmath189 , is at least @xmath190 .",
    "conditioning on @xmath191 , we aim now to estimate the probability that the survivor is eaten .",
    "assume that @xmath155 is even ; the odd case can be dealt similarly .",
    "consider a sequence of two consecutive rounds . at the beginning of each pair of rounds , before the survivor goes `` south '' , we measure the absolute difference between the corresponding @xmath128-coordinates of the players , to get a sequence @xmath192 of random variables .",
    "clearly , @xmath193 and the survivor is eaten if and only if @xmath194 . indeed , if @xmath195 , then the zombie ends up lined up horizontally before getting close to the survivor and from that point on she will continue keeping the distance .",
    "if @xmath196 , then , @xmath197 on the other hand , if @xmath198 , then the first move of the zombie is forced ( she goes `` north '' ) and so @xmath199 we can couple this process with a lazy random walk and one can show that @xmath200 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath165 from region  * r3 * is @xmath201 provided that @xmath177 is large enough .",
