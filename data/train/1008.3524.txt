    "a number of different methods have been used to obtain the surface transfer coefficients for one - component systems : experiments @xcite , molecular dynamic simulations @xcite , kinetic theory @xcite . in a paper coauthored by one of us @xcite the interfacial transfer coefficients",
    "were calculated with the square gradient theory for a one - component system , and compared to the data in the above references . even for one - component systems",
    "the database of interfacial transfer coefficients is poor and these data are pretty scattered .",
    "the situation is even worse for mixtures .",
    "there are only few experiments available @xcite at a very restrictive range of conditions , i.e. for instance , at infinite dilution .",
    "no molecular dynamic simulations are available yet .",
    "the only source of values of interfacial coefficients is kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is most appropriate for short range potentials and low density gases .",
    "there is evidence from molecular dynamic simulations for one - component systems for longer range potentials @xcite that the coupling transfer resistivities for liquid - vapor interfaces of real fluids are substantially larger than those predicted by kinetic theory .",
    "it is the aim of this article to determine the heat and mass transfer resistances of the interfacial region .",
    "the values of these transfer coefficients , or even their order of magnitude , are extremely important for industrial processes which involve evaporation and/or condensation of mixtures . among these processes",
    "is , for instance , distillation , when one needs to separate components with different volatilities .",
    "as this involves evaporation and/or condensation repeatedly many times , it is very important to know the exact effect of the surface .",
    "some values of the interfacial transfer coefficients may favor transport of a component , while other values may not .",
    "of particular interest are the values of the cross coefficients , which contribute to reversible transport , and which are in most descriptions neglected @xcite .",
    "we will verify that integral relations , derived in @xcite give the same values of resistances , obtained directly from a non - equilibrium numerical solution .",
    "the numerical solution is obtained using the non - equilibrium square gradient model @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to compare our predictions with other methods , in particular molecular simulations and experiments .",
    "such data are not available yet , however , and we will therefore use the predictions of kinetic theory to compare with .",
    "in our approach we use the local resistivity profiles .",
    "the values of the local resistivities in the liquid and the vapor phases are chosen on the basis of experimental values . in the interfacial region",
    "there are small peaks in these resistivities .",
    "the results of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite support the existence of such peaks in the local resistivities in the interfacial region .",
    "the amplitudes , being the adjustable parameters , control the magnitude of these peaks .",
    "the square gradient approach gives a natural tool to incorporate these peak in the theory .",
    "possible values of these amplitudes are found by matching the diagonal transfer coefficients to values predicted by kinetic theory . using these amplitudes",
    "we find that the value of the cross resistivities is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher then the one from kinetic theory .",
    "the results indicate that kinetic theory underestimates the interfacial transfer coefficients in real fluids .",
    "one of them even has a different sign .    consider a planar interface between a liquid and a vapor of a mixture through which there is evaporation or condensation .",
    "the mixture is in a box with gravity @xmath0 directed along the @xmath1-axis from left to right .",
    "the gas phase is therefore in the left part of the box and the liquid is in the right part . due to evaporation or condensation there",
    "exists a mass flux @xmath2 of component @xmath3 , which is equal to the mass of component @xmath3 transferred through a unit surface area per unit of time .",
    "furthermore , there exists the total energy flux @xmath4 , which is defined similarly . in stationary conditions",
    "these fluxes are constants ( independent of @xmath1 ) .",
    "a surface can be described by gibbs excess properties .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for an explanation how these quantities can be introduced in non - equilibrium . due to non - equilibrium conditions the temperature and the chemical potentials of the components are not the same in the liquid and in the gas phases .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the extrapolated temperatures of these phases at the surface .",
    "the exact position of the dividing surface is irrelevant for the following analysis .",

    "one can similarly use the measurable heat flux on the liquid side of the surface @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting resistance matrix @xmath33 differs from @xmath27 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath41 , the molar mass of component @xmath3 , appears in eq .   to adopt the molar transfer coefficients used in @xcite to the mass transfer coefficients used in this paper .",
    "all these quantities and as a consequence the resistances are calculated for a liquid and a vapor in coexistence at the temperature @xmath42 and the chemical potential difference @xmath43 of the surface , see @xcite in this context .",

    "this problem is , in a way , inverse to the common one , where one knows the resistances and , say , forces , and needs to determine the fluxes .",
    "as one can see , eq .   has 9 unknown resistances and only 3 equations .",
    "it is therefore not possible to determine all the transport coefficients uniquely having only one stationary state solution . in order to incorporate more equations we need to consider other non - equilibrium stationary solutions which are independent of the previous .",
    "an important observation should be made here .    in @xcite",
    "we have verified the validity of the hypothesis of local equilibrium of the surface .",

    ", we must ensure that for all perturbations the temperature of the surface and the chemical potential of the surface are the same . the simplest way to ensure",
    "this is to assume that @xmath54 and @xmath55 . as is clear from eq .",
    ", this can be considered true if the perturbation rate @xmath48 is small enough . as we decrease @xmath48 , the accuracy of this assumption increases and in the limit @xmath56 it becomes exact .",
    "it follows that @xmath57 in practice there exists a particular size @xmath58 of a perturbation , such that for all @xmath59 , @xmath54 and @xmath60 with a satisfactory accuracy .",
    "one should also note that the accuracy of a particular numerical procedure may impose a lower bound for the size of the the perturbation @xmath48 as well .",
    "all the non - equilibrium profiles and therefore forces and fluxes are calculated by solving the system of differential equations numerically with some particular accuracy .",
    "if a perturbation rate @xmath48 is lower then this accuracy , say @xmath61 , then the data obtained from the numerical procedure are not reliable .",

    "the method presented above makes the resistance matrix converge to @xmath87 as fast as @xmath88 goes to zero , however .",
    "this is achieved by using 8 symmetric perturbations at the `` corners '' of a three - dimensional `` perturbation cell '' , so changing @xmath89 to @xmath90 does not change the `` perturbation cell '' and the resulting @xmath72 . because of using 8 perturbations instead of 3 , there are 5 superfluous perturbations which make the system of equations to be overdetermined .",
