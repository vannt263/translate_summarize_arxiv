    "with the rapid emergence of social networking websites , e.g. , facebook , twitter , linkedin , epinions , etc .",
    ", a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to investigating the underlying social mechanisms in order to enhance users experiences @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "traditional social network analysis concerns itself primarily with unsigned social networks such as facebook or myspace which can be modeled as graphs , with nodes representing entities , and positively weighted edges representing the existence of relationships between pairs of entities .",
    "recently , signed directed social networks , in which the relationships between users can be either positive ( indicating relations such as trust ) or negative ( indicating relations such as distrust ) , are increasingly common . for instance , in epinions @xcite , which is a product review website with an active user community , users can indicate whether they trust or distrust other users based upon their reviews ; in slashdot @xcite@xcite , which is a technology - related news website , users can tag each other as `` friend '' or `` foe '' based upon their comments .",
    "such a signed directed network can be modeled as a graph expressed as an asymmetric adjacency matrix in which an entry is @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) if the relationship is positive ( or negative ) and 0 if the relationship is absent .",
    "one of the fundamental problems in signed social network analysis is edge sign inference @xcite@xcite , i.e. , inferring the unknown trust or distrust relationship given the existence of a particular edge . to address this issue ,",
    "many approaches have been developed based upon two main social - psychological theories , i.e. , structural balance theory @xcite@xcite and social status theory @xcite .",
    "structural balance theory is more well - known and it states that people in signed networks tend to follow the rules that `` the friend of my friend is my friend '' , `` the enemy of my friend is my enemy '' , etc .",
    "social status theory , which is implicit in guha et al .",
    "@xcite , further exploited by leskovec et al .",
    "@xcite , and based upon a foundation in social psychology @xcite , considers a positive directed edge to indicate that the initiator of the edge views the recipient as having higher status and a negative directed edge to indicate that the recipient is viewed as having lower status .",
    "the relative levels of status determine the allowed sign - direction pairs for an edge assuming that this edge exists .",
    "although both structural balance theory and social status theory have proved useful for explaining the signs of edges in signed networks , neither is suitable for explaining an observed edge when the two nodes connected by this edge share no common neighbor ( e.g. , common friend ) , and in fact , structural balance theory simply does not apply to this situation .",
    "since many real world social networking graphs tend to be very sparse , this is the case for a large fraction of their edges . to better explain the observed edge signs in general , in this paper we develop a novel approach to address this issue by applying a new model for node types .    to summarize the contributions of this paper :    * we explore the underlying local node structures in fully observed signed directed networks , recognizing that there are 16 different types of node and each type of node constrains both its incoming node types and its outgoing node types , i.e. , the signs of their edges must be consistent with their types . *",
    "we show that node type features can be extended to incorporate structural balance theory or social status theory , to help make predictions for those edges whose endpoints have common neighbors .",
    "* for the purpose of practical applications , we derive bayesian node features ( including bayesian node type and bayesian node properties ) based upon partially observed signed directed networks .",
    "* we conduct empirical studies based upon three real world datasets and show that our proposed approach can outperform state - of - the - art algorithms .",
    "in the past few years , many approaches have been developed to explore different aspects of signed networks , ranging from edge sign prediction @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite to community detection @xcite@xcite .",
    "most of these approaches are based upon structural balance theory or social status theory .",
    "the investigation of signed networks @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite can be traced back to the 1920s .",
    "heider  @xcite first formulated structural balance theory within social psychology .",
    "after that , cartwright and harary  @xcite formally provided the notion of structural balance with undirected triads ( as shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) and proved its necessity and sufficiency by utilizing the mathematical theory of graphs .",
    "intuitively , their theory can be explained as : `` the friend of my friend is my friend '' ( @xmath2 ) , `` the enemy of my friend is my enemy '' ( @xmath3 ) , `` the friend of my enemy is my enemy '' ( @xmath3 ) , and `` the enemy of my enemy is my friend '' ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "conceptually , their theory claims that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are balanced while @xmath4 and @xmath5 are unbalanced .",
    "davis  @xcite further generalized this theory to weak structural balance theory by allowing all the edges of triads to be negative , i.e. , `` the enemy of my enemy is my enemy '' ( @xmath5 is also balanced ) .",
    "note that these two balance theories were initially intended for modeling undirected networks , although they have been commonly applied to directed networks by disregarding the direction of edges @xcite .",
    "guha et al .",
    "@xcite first considered the edge sign prediction problem by developing a trust propagation framework to predict the trust ( or distrust ) between pairs of nodes . in their framework , they calculate a combined matrix which is a linear combination of four different one - step propagations , i.e. , direct propagation , co - citation , transpose trust , and trust coupling .",
    "then the trust and distrust propagations are achieved by calculating a linear combination of powers of this combined matrix .",
    "a shortcoming of this approach is that it can not be explained by structural balance theory @xcite@xcite .    motivated by this trust propagation idea @xcite and informed by social psychology @xcite , leskovec et al .",
    "@xcite developed social status theory to explain signed directed networks .",
    "in this theory , they assume that if there is a positive edge from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , it represents the fact that @xmath6 regards @xmath7 as having higher status than himself ( or herself ) , and if there is a negative edge from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , it represents the fact that @xmath6 regards @xmath7 as having lower status than himself ( or herself ) . assuming everyone in the system agrees on the same status ordering , we can infer signs easily as long as the existence and direction of edges are available .",
    "when prior status information for @xmath6 and @xmath7 is not available , we can still perform sign inference using the context provided by the rest of the network .",
    "for instance , in figure [ fig : fig3 ] , the sign of @xmath6 to @xmath7 can be inferred by referring to the status of @xmath8 , and is unambiguous in half the cases .      based upon structural balance theory and social status theory , leskovec et al .",
    "@xcite selected degree features and directed triad features for edges in signed directed networks .",
    "specifically , for the edge from node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 , they consider seven degree features , i.e. , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the number of incoming positive and negative edges to @xmath7 , respectively ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the number of outgoing positive and negative edges from @xmath6 , respectively ; @xmath13 , the number of common neighbors ( i.e. , embeddedness ) of node @xmath6 and node @xmath7 ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the total out - degree of @xmath6 and the total in - degree of @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "since each of the 16 triad types in figure [ fig : fig3 ] provides different evidence for the sign of the edge from node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 , directed triad features of this edge are encoded in a 16-dimensional vector counting the number of triads of each type in which this edge is involved . after computing the degree or directed triad features for the edge from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , a logistic regression classifier is used to combine the evidence from these individual features into an edge sign prediction .    subsequently , chiang et al .",
    "@xcite extended this approach by considering longer cycles ( e.g. , quadrilaterals , pentagons ) while ignoring the directions of edges to reduce the computational complexity .",
    "hsieh et al .",
    "@xcite formulated the sign inference problem as a low rank matrix completion ( approximation ) problem based upon weak balance theory .",
    "note that this approach was originally developed to explain a signed undirected network which is associated with a symmetric adjacency matrix and is different from our setting ( signed directed networks ) in this paper .",
    "we remark that structural balance theory is also popular for community detection in signed networks @xcite@xcite .",
    "although many approaches based upon structural balance theory or social status theory have been developed to perform edge sign prediction in signed networks , they can not work well when few topological features , i.e. , undirected ( or directed ) triads and long - range cycles , are available in the network .",
    "since many real world signed directed social networking graphs are very sparse , the efficacy of methods based upon these theories is limited .",
    "a more general approach for such networks is necessary .",
    "in this paper , we consider three well - known signed directed social networks : wikipedia @xcite , slashdot @xcite@xcite and epinions @xcite :    * the wikipedia data comprise a voting network for promoting candidates to the role of admin .",
    "the voters , half coming from existing admins and another half coming from ordinary wikipedia users , can indicate a positive ( for supporting ) or negative ( for opposing ) vote with respect to the promotion of a candidate @xcite .",
    "* slashdot is a social website focusing on technology related news . in slashdot zoo , users can tag each other as friends ( like ) or foes ( dislike ) based upon comments on articles .",
    "* epinions , which is a product review website , is a trust network in which users can indicate whether they trust or distrust each other based upon their reviews .",
    "the detailed statistics of these datasets are provided in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "note that in all three datasets , the majority of the edges is positive . due to this imbalance ,",
    "simply predicting all edges to be positive would yield 78.78@xmath16 , 77.4@xmath16 , and 85.0@xmath16 accuracy across the three datasets . to show the effectiveness of any approach",
    ", it should achieve substantially better performance than this .",
    "[ fig : subfig4a ]      [ fig : subfig4b ]      [ fig : subfig4c ]    figure [ fig:4 ] shows the fraction of edges versus edge embeddedness @xcite ( the number of common neighbors of the two nodes connected by the edge ) for three datasets .",
    "we observe that the edges with zero embeddedness comprise about @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 of the edges for wikipedia , slashdot , and epinions , respectively .",
    "note that a large fraction of zero embeddedness edges means that triad features @xcite can not work well for edge sign prediction .",
    "this is because the entries of triad feature vector will be zero and thus the triad features provide no evidence for edge sign prediction .",
    "in this paper , a fully observed signed directed network refers to a network in which there is no uncertainty about the existence of any directed edge and its associated sign .",
    "we consider a fully observed signed directed network as a graph @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the vertex set of size @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the edge set of size @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the associated signed adjacency matrix . because @xmath26 is a directed network , @xmath27 is an asymmetric matrix and can be represented as : @xmath28 note that @xmath29 represents no directed edge from node @xmath30 to node @xmath31 .    in this section ,",
    "we first investigate local node structures within fully observed signed directed networks , recognize a set of node types , show that these node types can be used to explain real world signed directed social networks , and show how to encode a specific node in such networks .",
    "next , we explore how these node types interact with one another and how these interactions can explain the edge signs .",
    "finally , we show our approach can be extended to incorporate structural balance theory or social status theory .      in our study",
    ", we focus on analyzing signed directed networks because they are more general and common than signed undirected networks in real world applications .",
    "for instance , each of the three datasets we consider in this paper is a signed directed network .",
    "generally , signed directed networks are sparse graphs in which nodes may be categorized into 4 groups based upon whether they have incoming edges and outgoing edges , i.e. , nodes with neither incoming nor outgoing edges ( e.g. , @xmath32 in figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) , nodes with only incoming edges ( e.g. , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 in figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) , nodes with only outgoing edges ( e.g. , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 in figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) , and nodes having both incoming and outgoing edges ( e.g. , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc . ) . moreover ,",
    "both the incoming edges and the outgoing edges of a given node can be categorized into 3 classes , one class with only positive edges , another class with only negative edges , and the third class with a mixture of positive and negative edges .",
    "combining these two principles , the nodes in signed directed networks can be categorized into 16 types , shown in figure [ fig : fig5 ] . note that the edges in figure [ fig : fig5 ] only indicate the types of the incoming or outgoing , i.e. , they do not represent the actual nonzero number of incoming ( outgoing ) positive ( negative ) edges .",
    "the fractions of each node type for the three real world datasets are shown in figure [ fig : fig6 ] .      to represent each node effectively , in addition to its node type @xmath42",
    ", we should consider its associated node properties , i.e. , the relative level of the number of positive ( negative ) incoming edges @xmath43 @xmath44 , and the relative level of the number of positive ( negative ) outgoing edges @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "first , we can use a 16-dimensional binary vector , @xmath47,@xmath48 ,  , @xmath49 $ ] , to indicate the node type .",
    "the indicator @xmath50 is 1 if @xmath42 is the same as @xmath51 .",
    "next , we can use a vector @xmath52 @xmath53 $ ] to denotes the ratio of positive ( negative ) incoming edges and that of positive ( negative ) outgoing edges .",
    "intuitively , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 represent the locally propagating properties of a node ( node property ) and they can be calculated with @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where we set @xmath62 to avoid zero denominators .",
    "figure [ fig : fig7 ] shows examples of these two parts of features for node type @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath41 .",
    "notice that @xmath65 if there is any input edge , but this sum is zero if there are none ; so these features are not redundant . also note that node property is essentially different from degree features because degree features aim to model a particular edge by considering the initiator s outgoing edges , recipient s incoming edges , and their common neighbors .",
    "note that although the node properties , i.e. , @xmath66@xmath67 $ ] implicitly indicate the node type information , it is still useful to consider type indication , i.e. , @xmath47,@xmath48 ,  , @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "since the latter is not a linear combination of the former , it can provide non - redundant information in the logistic regression classifier we will describe in the section 6 .",
    "we have shown there are 16 possible node types in any signed directed network .",
    "hence , theoretically there are @xmath68 combinations of node types . given a node of a certain type , however",
    ", it usually can only connect to ( or be reached from ) nodes in a subset of these types due to the compatibility of both directions and signs .",
    "in other words , there exists a logic to determine whether two nodes can be reached or not and whether the sign should be positive or negative .",
    "for instance , given a node of type @xmath69 , it can only be connected from a node of type @xmath70 or @xmath41 and the edge sign can only be negative .",
    "similarly , given a node of type @xmath71 , it can only be connected from a node of type @xmath72 or @xmath41 and connected to a node of type @xmath73 , or @xmath41 . moreover ,",
    "the edge sign is determined as positive and negative , respectively .",
    "given an edge from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , based upon the combinations of node type @xmath6 and node type @xmath7 , this edge can be categorized into three classes .",
    "@xmath74 denotes the edge sign is determined to be positive , @xmath75 denotes the edge sign is determined to be negative , and @xmath76 denotes the edge sign that can not be determined by the interaction of current two node types , i.e. , the edge sign can be either positive or negative . in our three datasets , there are @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 determined edges ( i.e. , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) for wikipedia , slashdot and epinions , respectively , each a large fraction of the total edges .",
    "although node types have shown their effectiveness for explaining the edge signs in fully observed signed social networks , there exists a fraction of the total edges for which signs can not be explained simply by node types . in this case",
    ", we can incorporate structural balance or social status theory with node types to address this issue .      as we described the node types and the interactions of these node types in the previous subsections",
    ", we did not need to consider whether there is any common neighbor for a pair of nodes .",
    "we should , however , be aware that when common neighbors exist for a pair of nodes , structural balance or social status theory may help to explain the sign of an edge between them .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , for instance , since @xmath80 has both positive and negative outgoing edges and @xmath41 has both positive and negative incoming edges , the sign of the edge between them can not be determined by the interaction of these two types .",
    "since @xmath80 and @xmath41 have two common neighbors , however , the sign of the edge between them may be explained by either structural balance theory or social status theory .",
    "within structural balance theory , we can disregard the directions of these two triads . from the red ( dotted ) triad",
    ", we can infer the sign of the edge between @xmath80 and @xmath41 to be positive based upon the rule that `` my friend s friend is my friend '' . from the blue ( dashed ) triad , on the contrary",
    ", we can infer the sign of this edge to be negative based upon the rule that `` my friend s enemy is my enemy '' .",
    "within social status theory , since both the red ( dotted ) triad and the blue ( dashed ) triad indicate that @xmath80 has higher status than @xmath41 , they consistently imply that the sign of the edge from @xmath80 to @xmath41 is negative .    to incorporate",
    "these directed triads as features , we use the same approach as leskovec et al .",
    "@xcite@xcite . given an edge from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and a common neighbor @xmath8 of @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ", the edge between @xmath6 and @xmath8 can have four possible configurations , i.e. , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , there are four possible signed edges between @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "hence we can obtain 16 types of triads each of which may provide different evidence about the sign of the edge from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "in real world applications , signed directed networks are often partially observed , i.e. , several edges signs are unknown or hidden . for example , in the wikipedia dataset , we probably know that someone has voted on a candidate , but we may not know this voter s opinion . in this case , we would like to infer this voter s opinion by learning some patterns based upon observed edges in the network .",
    "however , when these unobserved edges take different signs , both the node types and node properties may change . in this case , simple node features ( including node types and node properties ) may not be capable of capturing the range of possible unobserved signs and thus will be not reliable .    to address this issue ,",
    "we extend node features to bayesian node features by considering prior knowledge about unobserved signs in partially observed signed directed networks .    similarly to a",
    "fully observed signed directed network , a partially observed signed directed network can also be represented as a graph @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the vertex set of size @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the edge set of size @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the associated signed adjacency matrix . since @xmath26 is a directed network , @xmath27 is an asymmetric matrix and can be represented as : @xmath85 @xmath29 represents no directed edge from node @xmath30 to node @xmath31 .    in this section ,",
    "we first introduce bayesian node type , show how to calculate it based upon both observed ( training ) edges and unobserved ( test ) edges , and present two ways to encode the interaction of bayesian node types .",
    "next , we show how to calculate and represent bayesian node properties .      given any node in a partially observed network",
    ", assuming @xmath86 denotes the number of unobserved incoming edges and @xmath87 denotes the number of unobserved outgoing edges , let @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 ) represent the prior probability of incoming edges being positive ( negative ) and @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 ) represent the prior probability of outgoing edges being positive ( negative ) .",
    "from these probabilities , we can calculate its probability distribution over node types .",
    "take a node of type @xmath36 for example ( as shown in figure [ fig : fig9 ] ) , if @xmath92 and @xmath93 , its node type does not change ; if @xmath92 and @xmath94 , it has @xmath95 probability to be @xmath36 and @xmath96 probability to be @xmath38 ; if @xmath97 and @xmath93 , it has @xmath98 probability to be @xmath99 , @xmath100 probability to be @xmath101 , and @xmath102 probability to be @xmath103 ; if @xmath97 and @xmath94 , it has @xmath104 probability to be @xmath99 , @xmath105 probability to be @xmath101 , @xmath106 probability to be @xmath103 , @xmath107 probability to be @xmath80 , @xmath108 probability to be @xmath40 , and @xmath109 @xmath110 probability to be @xmath41 .",
    "this calculation determines a 16 dimensional vector which encodes the distribution of possible node types .",
    "note that similar vectors can be calculated for other types of nodes .",
    "we do not specify the calculation for each node type due to the the space limit .    to initialize @xmath88 and @xmath90 , we can also use the bayesian node properties @xmath111 and @xmath112 , i.e. , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , to claim that each unobserved edge obeys bayesian node properties ( i.e. , local priors ) .",
    "given an observed ( training ) edge connecting node @xmath6 and node @xmath7 , we can obtain two vectors @xmath115 and @xmath116 by calculating their bayesian node types . to encode the interaction of bayesian node types",
    ", we can ( 1 ) simply concatenate these two vectors to form a 32 dimensional vector ; or ( 2 ) calculate the kronecker product of these two vectors , i.e. , @xmath117 , and form a 256 dimensional vector",
    ". we should be aware that the vector formed by the kronecker product encodes the probability distribution of different node type interactions .",
    "given an unobserved ( test ) edge connecting node @xmath6 and node @xmath7 , we should consider both possible signs as shown in figure [ fig : fig10 ] .",
    "specifically , we first decompose this kind of interaction into two separate cases , i.e. , the edge sign being positive and negative .",
    "next , we calculate the bayesian node types , represent their interactions ( either concatenation vector or kronecker product vector ) of both cases . finally , we calculate the linear combination of these two cases with respect to the prior probability of the signs ( i.e. , @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) over observed edges .      given a node in a partially observed network , assuming @xmath86 denotes the number of unobserved incoming edges and @xmath87 denotes the number of unobserved outgoing edges , by assigning to these @xmath120 edges different signs , the node properties also change .    to capture the range of possible signs of unobserved edges",

    "specifically , the bayesian node properties are represented as following : @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath118 is the prior probability of positive edges and @xmath119 is the prior probability of negative edges .    to encode the interaction of bayesian node properties , we simply concatenate two of the bayesian node properties vectors to form an 8 dimensional vector .    as in the previous section ,",
    "when common neighbors exist for a pair of nodes , structural balance or social status theory may be incorporated with bayesian node features to help explain the sign of an edge between them .",
    "given a fully observed signed directed network , the node type interactions , extended to triads with structural balance or social status theory , are useful to explain the edge signs . partially observed signed directed networks , however , are too complicated to fully conform to the rules of simple node type interactions .",

    "this illustrates that bayesian node features plus triad features not only are useful on intra - dataset evaluation but also have good generalization capability .",
    "this is extremely helpful for edge sign prediction in signed networks with few training examples .",
    "in this paper , we explored the underlying local node structures in signed networks , recognizing that there are 16 different types of node and each type of node constrains both its incoming node types and its outgoing node types , i.e. , the sign of an edge between two nodes must be consistent with their types . this is a highly structured alternative to the ordered scalar node types postulated by social status theory .",
    "we demonstrated that the interaction between these more complicated node types can explain edge signs well .",
    "we also showed that our approach can be extended to incorporate triad features whose inclusion is motivated by structural balance theory or social status theory .",
    "we derived bayesian node features ( including bayesian node type and bayesian node properties ) based upon partially observed signed directed network .",
    "empirical studies based upon three large scale datasets , i.e. , wikipedia , slashdot , and epinions showed that the proposed bayesian node features plus triad features outperform state - of - the - art algorithms on edge sign prediction .",
    "moreover , we showed that bayesian node features plus triad features are more effective than baseline approaches for cross - dataset edge sign predictions .    in the future",
    ", it will be interesting to study the link recommendation problem based upon bayesian node features as well as other explicit topological features of signed social networks .",
