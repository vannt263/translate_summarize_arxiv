    "as we show next , these representations make it possible to analyse the behaviour of generating functions towards  @xmath46 , knowing growth and singularity properties of the coefficient function  @xmath28 in the complex plane .",

    "the tails of the gaussian integral then decrease exponentially in  @xmath52 .    in order to show that this is indeed the dominant part of the integral  , it remains to prove that the portion of the integral from @xmath53 to  @xmath54 ( and thus , by symmetry , also from  @xmath55 to  @xmath56 ) grows more slowly .",
    "first we consider @xmath57 . in this range",
    "we have @xmath58 , and @xmath59 lead to the bound @xmath60 . to make the integral convergent",

    "now consider @xmath61 .",
    "the factor  @xmath62 is @xmath63 there , and the estimate @xmath64 follows from evaluating  @xmath65 , which is a decreasing function of  @xmath66 , at @xmath67 . since @xmath68 we have established the tail estimate @xmath69 which grows slower than the absolute error in  .",
    "hence the asymptotic behaviour of  @xmath70 near infinity is @xmath71 the error term follows from taking @xmath72\\tfrac23,\\tfrac34[}$ ] close to  @xmath73 .",

    "we present the detailed proof for the parameter values @xmath88 .",
    "then , the integrand of the lindelf integral @xmath89 has two saddle points , at  @xmath90 , roughly , which will induce an oscillating factor .",
    "the argument of the axis of the upper saddle point is  @xcite @xmath91 and that of the lower saddle point is  @xmath92 .",
    "we choose an integration path that has two segments passing through these saddle points at an angle of  @xmath93 with respect to the real axis and with length  @xmath94 , where  @xmath17 is yet to be chosen .",
    "the segments are joined by a vertical line , and extended by vertical lines towards  @xmath95 .",
    "our path thus consists of the five segments ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig:2sp ] ) @xmath96    , where @xmath97 , and the new integration contour crossing the two approximate saddle points . ]",
    "we will see that the exponent  @xmath17 must satisfy the same bounds as in the previous subsection , i.e.  @xmath98 . for the segment  @xmath99 , containing the lower saddle point",
    ", we again appeal to the expansions from figure  [ ta : expansions ] and find @xmath100 here we have set @xmath101 , and assume that  @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath102 for  @xmath51 , we thus have @xmath103 the contribution of the upper saddle point , @xmath104 is similarly found .",

    "the portion of  @xmath108 with @xmath57 is @xmath109 , by the same argument as in the case of one saddle point .",
    "now consider the lower part of  @xmath108 , where we have @xmath110 .",
    "the factor @xmath111 is of order  @xmath112 .",
    "also , it is easy to see that  @xmath113 is a decreasing function of  @xmath66 there . at the lower endpoint of  @xmath108 , we estimate @xmath114 since we have @xmath115 in  @xmath108 , this segment thus contributes only @xmath116 to the integral .",
    "finally , we examine the segment  @xmath107 .",
    "the factor  @xmath113 is an increasing function of  @xmath117 there .",
    "hence it suffices to estimate @xmath118 at the upper endpoint of  @xmath107 , which is straightforward and shows that the integral over  @xmath107 is also negligible .",
    "this completes the tail estimate .",
    "equation   hence yields the result @xmath119 the generalization to arbitrary negative parameters is as follows .",
    "[ thm : twosaddle ] let @xmath87 and @xmath77 be real numbers .",
    "then @xmath120 as @xmath79 in an arbitrary sector with vertex at zero that does not contain the negative real axis .",
    "the constants are defined by @xmath121 so that  @xmath122 is negative for @xmath123 , zero for @xmath124 , and positive for @xmath125 .",
    "the exponent  @xmath83 is as in theorem  [ thm : saddle ] .",
    "the general proof is very similar to the special case @xmath88 ( see above ) , upon taking into account the following comments . there might be more than two saddle points in general , but we have to consider only the ones that form a conjugate pair having the largest real part , which are ( approximately ) at @xmath126 .",
    "the saddle point axes have the arguments @xmath127 .",
    "when @xmath128 , the proof proceeds as above .",
    "the parameter  @xmath17 , which governs the size of the two contour segments containing the saddle points , must satisfy @xmath129    for @xmath130 , there is one minor problem in the tail estimate : the decrease of @xmath131 does not hold on the whole of  @xmath108 .",
    "in fact it is plausible that there are oscillations here if  @xmath132 is large .",
    "what happens is that , moving upwards along  @xmath108 , the quantity @xmath133 decreases up to a local minimum , at  @xmath134 say .",
    "this results from elementary analysis ; the argument of  @xmath134 is @xmath135 .",
    "now the integral over the portion of  @xmath108 below  @xmath134 can be estimated as before , by taking into account the length of this part of the contour and the size of the integrand at the lower endpoint of  @xmath108 . above  @xmath134 , the crude estimate @xmath136 suffices .    finally ,",
    "when @xmath123 , the contour has to be slightly adjusted , as the two saddle points at @xmath137 have negative real part , and we may not push the contour over the singularity at zero . instead of joining the two central segments  @xmath99 and  @xmath138 by a vertical line , we stretch each of them into the right half - plane , stopping at @xmath139 .",
    "then we join them by a vertical line , whose upper endpoint we call  @xmath140 .",
    "the value  @xmath141 decreases as we move on  @xmath138 to the right , until  @xmath142 , from which point it increases .",
    "moreover , as we move downwards from  @xmath140 , the quantity @xmath143 decreases until  @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to check that the integrand at  @xmath140 is of growth slower than the central part of the integral , a property that is easily checked to hold .",
    "it remains to consider the parameter region @xmath145 , which is not covered by our previous asymptotic estimates of  @xmath86 .",
    "first , for parameter values @xmath87 , @xmath146 , which make  @xmath86 an entire function , a formula similar to   holds .",
    "the exponential growth order is the same as in  , except for a different constant in place of  @xmath81 . in particular , the sequence  @xmath147 is not holonomic for these parameter values either , as @xmath148 .",
    "this asymptotic property is a special case of a result due to valiron  @xcite , who used the laplace method to investigate the behaviour of  @xmath149 as @xmath150 , where  @xmath151 is a smooth function that satisfies certain regularity conditions .",
    "( valiron s conditions actually require @xmath152 , but his analysis is easily extended . )    finally , in the remaining parameter range @xmath76 , @xmath145 , the sequence  @xmath147 grows faster than any power of  @xmath153 , which is incompatible with the growth of any holonomic sequence .",
    "( in fact this observation shows that the ( formal ! ) power series  @xmath86 does not even satisfy an algebraic differential equation  @xcite . )",
    "beyond establishing non - holonomicity , the analysis near infinity of generating functions , such as @xmath86 , is also of interest in the estimation of finite differences and related combinatorial sums . given a sequence  @xmath0 , we shall refer to the derived sequence @xmath154:=\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k f_k\\ ] ] as the sequences of _ differences_.

    ", the `` surprise '' is the fact that , for many explicit and simple sequences  @xmath156 , the corresponding  @xmath163 are much smaller than  @xmath162 : huge cancellations occur in   ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for cases related to  @xmath164 , and so on ) .",
    "for instance , with @xmath165 , @xmath166 , we find @xmath167 and the sequence appears to grow rather slowly . for  @xmath168 , it even appears numerically to tend slowly to  @xmath40 .",
    "( for recent estimates relative to zeta values and inverse zeta values , see for instance ,  @xcite . )",
    "we now explain how a lindelf type of analysis can serve to quantify such phenomena .",

    "note that both slowly varying and periodic functions can be subjected to singularity analysis  @xcite , so that the formulas @xmath186 yield   and  , respectively .",
    "the estimate   bears a striking formal resemblance with the growth of the average value of the multiplicative partition function , which was found by oppenheim  @xcite and szekeres and turn  @xcite .",
