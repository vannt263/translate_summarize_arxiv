    "the statistical properties of the shell - model states of nuclei around @xmath0 mg are studied a few years ago @xcite by using two - body forces which are obtained by fitting the low - lying states of different nuclei of the @xmath1 shell . in the center of the spectra , the generic properties",
    "are well expressed in spite of the two - body character of the forces used in the calculations .",
    "it is therefore not surprisingly that embedded random matrix ensembles are relevant for a description of eigenfunctions and transition strengths in many - body quantum systems @xcite .",
    "some regularity in the ground state region of the spectra is obtained in recent calculations with the two - body random ensemble @xcite which could be explained in the cases considered @xcite .    in the calculations with the two - body random ensemble ,",
    "the two - body character of the forces in the hamiltonian and the pauli principle are taken into account : states with given total angular momentum @xmath2 consist of @xmath3 identical fermi - particles distributed among a set of single - particle states , and interact via two - body matrix elements . by standard shell - model ( sm ) techniques ,",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is calculated in terms of the independent two - body matrix elements which are taken at random from a given distribution .",
    "the number of independent two - body matrix elements is small as compared to the total number of matrix elements . due to its nearness to the sm , the two - body random ensemble is expected to be more appropriate than the gaussian orthogonal ensemble for a study of nuclear spectra @xcite .",
    "the level density calculated with a two - body random ensemble is , indeed , more realistic than that of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble .",
    "it is nearly gaussian in contrast with the wigner s semi - circle law , that holds for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble in the limit of a large number of states .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spectrum of @xmath3 fermions distributed over @xmath4 orbitals and the structure of the eigenstates is calculated with a two - body random ensemble by using the methods of scar theory . at the edges of the spectrum ,",
    "significant deviations from random matrix theory expectations are found .",
    "the deviations are much smaller when a spin is added to the hamiltonian ( as in nuclear sm calculations ) . due to the spin ,",
    "the single - particle states split and the many - particle sm states may cross .",
    "the crossing of any interacting discrete states is , however , not free but avoided .",
    "thus , the results of the calculations @xcite with and without spin differ by the number of avoided crossings of their levels .    it is the aim of the present paper to study the relation between avoided crossings of levels and the mixing of their wave functions in detail",
    ". the avoided crossings of the _ many - particle _ levels are a property of the whole system consisting of _ many _ particles .",
    "the correlations induced by them are a second - order effect ( via the continuum ) as compared to those induced directly by the two - body forces .",
    "nevertheless , they may play an important role , especially at high level density .    in section 2 ,",
    "the relation between branch points and avoided level crossings is discussed by means of a simple example .",
    "the correlations induced by the branch points in the complex plane are considered in section 3 .",
    "numerical examples are shown and discussed in section 4 and the results obtained are summarized in the last section .",
    "to every avoided crossing of discrete states , the corresponding crossing point in the complex plane can be found .",
    "this can be seen by considering the matrix @xmath5 whose eigenvalues are @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "further , @xmath8 is the energy @xmath9 of the state @xmath10 continued by @xmath11 into the complex plane . the states with energies @xmath9",
    "are assumed to be unperturbed by any interaction with other states .",
    "their energies may be traced as a function of a certain parameter @xmath12 .",
    "diagonalizing @xmath13 gives the energies @xmath14 of the eigenstates of @xmath13 in which the interaction @xmath15 between the two basic states @xmath16 and @xmath17 is taken into account .",
    "the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : matr1a ] ) shows the following .",
    "when the non - diagonal matrix elements @xmath15 ( which describe the interaction between the two states @xmath18 ) are real and different from zero , the two states @xmath7 can cross , as a function of the parameter @xmath12 , only in the complex plane .",
    "the crossing point @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 this crossing point is a branch point in the complex plane according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : matr1a ] ) .",
    "it lies at @xmath22 .",
    "the non - trivial mathematical properties of these branch points in the complex plane as well as their relation to the higher - order poles of the @xmath23 matrix are known for a long time , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath24 of @xmath25 are bi - orthogonal .",
    "they are normalized @xcite according to @xmath26 and therefore @xmath27 approaching a double pole , @xmath28 see @xcite , and @xmath29 see @xcite . at an avoided crossing in the complex plane and in its neighborhood , the difference between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is large but finite .",
    "numerical examples are given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 matrix contains @xmath32 but not @xmath33 , i.e. it behaves smoothly also when the bi - orthogonality is large .",
    "this holds also at a double pole of the @xmath23 matrix where two resonance states cross @xcite .",
    "the influence of avoided level crossings on the dynamics of a system under adiabatic conditions and on the correlations between the different states has been studied in atoms @xcite and open quantum billiards @xcite . in these systems , it is possible to trace the turn - over of the avoided crossings into a real crossing ( corresponding to a double pole of the @xmath23 matrix ) by tuning the system parameters .",
    "all the results obtained show that branch points in the complex plane may have an important influence on the spectroscopic properties of a quantum system although their number is of measure zero .",
    "the correlations between states are expressed usually by the mixing of their wave functions @xmath34 where the @xmath35 are the eigenfunctions of the hamilton operator @xmath36 of the unperturbed system . in the sm calculations , the functions @xmath35 are the slater determinants .",
    "they do not contain any residual forces and represent therefore a natural basis set for the sm wave functions @xmath37 . in the case of an open quantum system , the functions @xmath35 are the wave functions of the corresponding closed system . in the continuum shell model , these are the sm wave functions @xmath38 . in the case of the matrix ( [ eq : matr1a ] ) , @xmath36 is defined by @xmath39 and the @xmath35 are the eigenfunctions of @xmath36 .",
    "the schrdinger equation of an open quantum system with the hamiltonian @xmath25 can be written as @xmath40 where the operator @xmath41 describes the interaction of the two states @xmath42 and @xmath43 via the environment . in the case of the continuum shell model ,",
    "this is the interaction via the continuum which is complex , as a rule @xcite . the source term ( rhs . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nls ] ) ) contains the @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the mixing of the wave functions via the continuum is related to the bi - orthogonality of the eigenfunctions of @xmath25 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bio2 ] ) .",
    "numerical examples for the bi - orthogonality , given in e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , show that the standard relations @xmath45 are not fulfilled neither at the branch point in the complex plane nor at an avoided level crossing , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bio2 ] ) .",
    "thus the source term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nls ] ) contains terms being non - linear in the wave functions @xmath24 when the quantum system is open and the @xmath46 are complex .",
    "sm calculations are performed with an hermitian hamilton operator @xmath47 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are real .",
    "it seems therefore , that the source term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nls ] ) can not play any role in the sm calculations .",
    "this is , however , not true as will be shown in the following .",
    "the reason for this unexpected behaviour is , above all , the analyticity of the wave functions . the eigenvalues lying at negative energy show , as a function of tuning the system parameters , the same motion in the complex plane as those at positive energy .    in the following",
    ", the motion of the eigenvalues by varying the system parameters will be considered in a language more fitting into the concept of the sm . as a matter of fact ,",
    "sm calculations provide not only the eigenvalues @xmath48 of the sm states but also the eigenfunctions @xmath49 . knowing the sm wave functions @xmath50 of the system consisting of @xmath51 particles and those of the system with one particle less , the amplitudes @xmath52 of the spectroscopic factors can be calculated . here , @xmath53 is the wave function of a well - defined state of the residual system having one bound particle less than the initial system .",
    "these amplitudes depend on the quantum numbers of the separated particle . by multiplying the spectroscopic factor with an energy dependent common penetration factor ,",
    "one gets the probability for the transition of the initial state @xmath54 ( with @xmath51 bound particles ) to the decay channel @xmath55 ( with one particle in relative motion to a certain state of the system with @xmath56 bound particles ) .",
    "the separated particle may either be transferred ( at negative energy ) or emitted ( at positive energy ) . in the last case , the product of spectroscopic factor and penetration factor",
    "is identified with the partial decay width @xmath57 of the state @xmath54 into the channel @xmath55 .",
    "further , @xmath58 is the width of an isolated state .",
    "thus , the most characteristic part of the width @xmath59 of an isolated state is involved in the spectroscopic factor calculated from sm wave functions .    as a result",
    ", the sm eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the two bound systems with @xmath51 and @xmath56 particles , respectively , contain all information on the motion of the complex values @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is proportional to the spectroscopic factor ) by varying the system parameters , although both hamiltonians @xmath62 and @xmath63 are hermitian and their eigenvalues are real .",
    "the accompanying motion of the energies @xmath48 is considered in many studies and avoided level crossings have been observed . the accompanying motion of the spectroscopic factors ,",
    "however , is not considered up to now .",
    "in order to illustrate the motion of the energies and spectroscopic factors as a function of a certain parameter , let us consider the matrix @xmath25 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : matr1 ] ) , with @xmath64 and @xmath15 real . by means of the parameter @xmath12 , crossing or avoided crossing of the two states",
    "can be traced under different conditions , e.g. for different values of @xmath15 .",
    "the results show crossing for @xmath39 and avoided crossing for all @xmath65 at the critical value @xmath66 .",
    "the influence of @xmath15 on the eigenvalues is small as long as @xmath15 is small : the typical avoided - crossing behaviour can be seen ( landau - zener effect , figure [ fig : energ ] top left ) .",
    "the two states are exchanged , what is surely without any interest for statistical considerations . for larger @xmath15 ,",
    "the avoided crossing of the eigenvalues as a function of @xmath12 is difficult to see in the trajectories : the eigenvalues are weakly dependent on @xmath12 .",
    "the comparison with the eigenvalues for @xmath39 shows , however , the changes of the trajectories in the neighborhood of @xmath67 .",
    "the wave functions are exchanged also in this case at @xmath68 .",
    "the wave functions are mixed strongly near @xmath67 for all @xmath15 as can be seen from the right - hand side of figure [ fig : energ ] . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath69 of the representation @xmath70 , eq . ( [ eq : smwf ] ) , for @xmath71 and 1 are shown ( @xmath72 are the wave functions at @xmath39 ) .",
    "while the wave functions are mixed only in a very small region around the critical value @xmath67 for small @xmath15 , they are mixed also at large distances @xmath73 when @xmath15 is larger ( figure [ fig : energ ] ) . at high level density , avoided level crossings with other states",
    "appear , as a rule , before @xmath74 is reached . as a consequence , the @xmath75 contain components from more than just the two crossing levels .    for illustration ,",
    "the energies and wave functions of four states are calculated from @xmath76 and shown in figure [ fig : energ2 ] for the two values @xmath77 and 0.03 ( @xmath78 ) . as long as @xmath15 is small , the influence of the branch points consists mainly in an exchange of the corresponding two states and of the mixing of just these two wave functions in a region @xmath73 which is well separated from other analogous regions around other critical values . at larger",
    "@xmath15 , however , the states are exchanged and mixed with _ all _ the other ones since the different regions @xmath79 , corresponding to different branching points , overlap .    in the special case",
    "considered , the regions @xmath79 in which @xmath74 is reached , are well separated for the different critical values @xmath80 as long as @xmath81 .",
    "the overlap of the different regions @xmath79 starts at @xmath82 . here",
    ", the mixing of the wave function of every state with those of all the other ones starts .",
    "it changes smoothly with increasing @xmath83 .",
    "characteristic of this regime is that an unequivocal identification of the @xmath54 and @xmath84 in the mixing coefficients @xmath69 is impossible . in this manner ,",
    "correlations between the wave functions of all the states may be created by the avoided crossings , more exactly , by the branch points in the complex plane ( expressed mathematically by the source term in the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : nls ] ) ) .    due to the mixing , the wave functions of the states become more similar and the differences of their spectroscopic factors in relation to a certain channel become less .",
    "that means , the level repulsion along the real axis is accompanied by an adjustment of the spectroscopic factors .",
    "this result coincides fully with the results obtained from a study of the motion of the poles of the @xmath23 matrix in the neighborhood of an avoided crossing in the complex plane . here",
    ", level repulsion along the real axis is accompanied by an adjustment of the widths @xcite .",
    "the results show that the energies of the states are almost independent of @xmath12 and @xmath15 , if @xmath15 is sufficiently large or ( and ) the level density is high .",
    "that means , the system is stabilized against ( real ) distortions of any type .",
    "this is true also for the distortions introduced by the real part of the coupling to the continuum ( principal value integral ) which does not vanish , generally @xcite . in any case , the states have lost their individual sm properties by spreading their spectroscopic features .",
    "this spreading is caused by the source term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nls ] ) which continues analytically into the function space of the discrete states .",
    "it does no longer show features characteristic of the special type of the two - body forces used in the calculation .",
    "it follows immediately , that the states in the centre of a sm spectrum show features caused by the branch points in the complex plane , i.e. by the non - linear terms in the schrdinger equation .",
    "the states at the border of the spectrum are less influenced by avoided crossings with other states .",
    "this is true especially for the lowest states which may shift downwards by crossing only a few ( or no ) other states .",
    "in this paper , the influence of branch points in the complex plane onto the correlations between the states of a quantum system is studied . as a quantitative measure of the correlations , the degree of mixing of the wave functions , i.e.",
    "the values @xmath85 in the representation ( [ eq : smwf ] ) is used .",
    "the results are the following .    *",
    "the exchange of two discrete levels which avoid crossing can be traced back to the existence of a branch point in the complex plane . here , the levels have equal energies and widths , their wave functions are linearly dependent , and the schrdinger equation contains non - linear terms . * the correlations induced by the branch points in the complex plane appear between the discrete states of a closed system in the same manner as between the resonance states of an open system . *",
    "the number of avoided level crossings at high level density is much larger than usually assumed .",
    "most important correlations are introduced even by those avoided crossings which are difficult to identify at first sight .",
    "it follows further from these results that the correlations induced by the branch points in the complex plane are the larger the higher the level density is . at the edges of the spectrum , branch points have only a small influence on the spectrum .",
    "the properties of these states are therefore determined , at least partly , by two - body forces .",
