    "clusters of galaxies are strong emitters of x - rays , which originate from a hot and diffuse intra - cluster medium ( icm ) at temperatures of a few @xmath3 k. the soft x - ray band below @xmath1 1 kev often feature the ` soft excess ' emission phenomenon , i.e. , radiation in excess of that expected from the hot icm .",
    "the excess emission could originate from inverse - compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons against a population of relativistic electrons in the intra - cluster medium ( hwang 1997 , sarazin and lieu 1998 , ensslin and biermann 1998 , lieu et al .",
    "1999 ) . alternatively ,",
    "warm gas at t@xmath4 k could be responsible for the soft emission ( e.g. , lieu et al .",

    "2003 , bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) .",
    "warm gas may reside inside the cluster , or in very diffuse filamentary structures outside the cluster , as seen in large scale hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , cen and ostriker 1999 , dav et al .",
    "2001 , cen et al 2001 ) .",
    "the warm gas scenario appears to be favored by the current x - ray data ( e.g. , bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001a , buote 2001 , kaastra et al .",
    "the soft excess emission is present in @xmath1 50% of the clusters .",
    "two surveys by bonamente et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and kaastra et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported , respectively , detection of soft excess emission in 18/38 clusters and in 7/21 clusters that were investigated .",
    "also , the excess is normally detected when the observations have a high s / n , such as in the nearby virgo ( bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001a ) and coma clusters ( bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) .",
    "the relative importance of the soft excess component  with respect to the hot icm component  normally increases with radial distance from the cluster center .",
    "this is the case of the coma cluster ( fig.1 ; bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) , of a1795 ( mittaz et al . 1998 ) , a2199 ( lieu , bonamente and mittaz 1999 ) , virgo ( bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001a ; lieu et al .",
    "1996a ) , mkw3s and a2052 ( kaastra et al .",
    "an important exception in as1101 ( bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001a ) , where the soft excess is sharply peaked at the cluster s center .",
    "thermal modelling of the soft excess component is normally favored by the goodness - of - fit analysis . among the highest s / n data analyzed to date",
    ", the coma cluster pspc data favors the thermal interpretation for the majority of its regions ( fig .",
    "2 ; bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) . the detection of ovii emission lines in the soft x - ray spectra of a few clusters , reported by kaastra et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from xmm data , would be the unmistakable signature of the thermal nature of the soft excess .",
    "a confirmation of those lines with higher s / n is however required before the detection be regarded as definitive .",
    "the non - thermal interpretation remains a plausible explaination for the excess emission , and it can not be formally rejected in its entirety . in order to explain the detected excess emission as non - thermal radiation , some clusters require that the cosmic rays be near or above pressure equipartition with the hot gas ( lieu et al .",
    "1999 ; bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001a ) .",
    "if the excess emission is of thermal origin , it is possible to envisage two scenarios : + ( 1 ) the ` warm ' gas coexists with the ` hot ' gas . in this case",
    ", it is possible to estimate the density of the warm gas from the emission integral @xmath5 ; in coma the warm gas would have a density of 9@xmath6 @xmath7 to @xmath8 @xmath7 ( bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) .",
    "if the soft excess emission originates from a warm phase of the intra - cluster medium , the ratio of the emission integral ( @xmath5 ) of the hot icm and the emission integral of the warm gas can be used to measure the relative mass of the two phases .",
    "the emission integral is readily measured by fitting the x - ray spectrum . for the pspc data of the coma cluster",
    ", we calculated @xmath9=0.75 within a radius of 2.6 mpc ( bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the ` warm ' gas resides in low density filamentary structures outside the clusters , the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "this scenario follows several cosmological simulations ( e.g. , cen and ostriker 1999 ) which identify the majority of the low - redshift baryons in a tenuous network of whim filaments . following this interpretation",
    ", the gas should feature overdensities of @xmath10 , corresponding to @xmath11 @xmath7 ( for @xmath12 ) , and a median overdensity of @xmath13 ( dav et al .",
    "we employ a simple model where constant - density filaments are directed towards the observer . in this case",
    ", the emission integral of the soft phase becomes @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the projected area of the filaments and @xmath16 their length along the line of sight . in order to explain the detected @xmath17",
    ", filaments should extend for several mpc in front of the cluster ( see table 1 ) .",
    "consider the case of filaments with density @xmath18 @xmath7 ( @xmath19 ) : the filaments should then extend for several hundred mega - parsecs !",
    "this figure is at odds with typical results from cosmological simulations , and with the fact that the coma cluster is located at a distance of @xmath1 95 mpc from the galaxy .",
    "filaments of higher density ( @xmath20 @xmath7 ) will require shorter @xmath16 ( table 1 ) ; in this case the scenario becomes tenable ( bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 ) , although still at odds with the results from cosmological simulations , which predict an average filament density considerably lower than @xmath21 @xmath7 .",
    "this result is consistent with a detailed analysis of the soft x - ray emission predicted by the whim filaments seen in some recent simulations ( e.g. , cen et al .",
    "the analysis reveals that the whim filaments predict several times ( @xmath22 ) lower soft x - ray fluxes than those of the typical soft excess emission ( mittaz et al .",
    "2004 ) as , e.g. , that of the coma cluster .",
    "similar results apply to the soft excess of the as1101 cluster , where a strong centrally - peaked soft excess emission was detected ( bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001a ) .",

    "description of the pspc data used to obtain the emission integrals @xmath17 can be found in bonamente , joy and lieu ( 2003 ) .    following this scenario , and for a filament density of @xmath25 @xmath7 ,",
    "the pspc data of coma yields the conclusion that @xmath29=3 within a radius of 2.6 mpc ( bonamente , joy and lieu 2003 )",
    ". the warm gas would therefore be more massive than the hot icm if it is distributed in low - density filaments .",
    "as the total mass of the coma cluster within 14 mpc is 1.6@xmath30 ( geller , diaferio and kurtz 1999 ) and the mass of the hot icm is @xmath31 within 2.6 mpc ( mohr , mathiesen and evrard 1999 ) , the soft excess emission could account for a significant fraction of the low - redshift @xmath32 .",
    "kaastra et al .",
    "( 2003 ) resported similar results from xmm observations of several clusters including as1101 , mkw3s and a2052 .",
    "detection of soft x - ray excess emission from galaxy clusters is commonplace .",
    "the radiation is more prominent at the cluster outskirts , and it indicates that clusters may be a significant reservoir of ` warm ' baryons .",
    "precise mass estimates for the ` soft ' component require knowledge of the exact location of the emitter .",
    "if the gas is located in filaments outside the clusters , the detection of soft excess in the coma cluster indicates that the ` warm ' gas is more massive than the hot icm .",
    "filaments of considerably higher density than predicted by the current cosmological simulations are needed to explain the detected excess emission from the coma cluster .",
