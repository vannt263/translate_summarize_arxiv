    "@xmath43 is technically better than @xmath40 , because @xmath43 is almost proportional to @xmath16 at low @xmath43 , and the @xmath43 distribution favors the projection of @xmath24 to zero @xmath43 .",
    "the ampt model has been exploited to verify the disappearance of flow backgrounds at zero @xmath43 , and simple monte carlo simulations have been utilized to study the artificial correlations in the ese process .",
    "base on these findings , we have designed an effective recipe to experimentally remove flow backgrounds and restore the ensemble average of the cme signal .",
    "when the reconstruction of @xmath40 is hindered by the low multiplicity of rare particles , an alternative path can be adopted with the ensemble averages of several observables to retrieve the cme signal .",

    "<S> recent charge - dependent azimuthal correlation measurements in high - energy heavy - ion collisions have observed charge - separation signals perpendicular to the reaction plane , and the observations have been related to the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the correlation signal is contaminated with the background contributions due to the collective motion ( flow ) of the collision system , and it remains elusive to effectively remove the background from the correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we present a method study with monte carlo simulations and a multi - phase transport model , and develop a scheme to reveal the true cme signal via the event - shape engineering with the flow vector , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach using the ensemble averages of observables is also discussed . </S>"
