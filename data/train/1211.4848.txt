    "the cosmological constant problem ( ccp ) is now regarded as a major crisis of modern theoretical physics . for some reviews of the `` old '' ccp ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the problem is that simple estimates of the zero point energy , or vacuum energy , of a single bosonic quantum field yield a huge value ( the standard calculation is reviewed below ) . in the past , this led many theorists to suspect that it was zero , perhaps due to a principle such as supersymmetry .",
    "the modern version of the crisis is that astrophysical measurements reveal a very small positive value@xcite@xcite : [ rhovacmeasured ] _",
    "= 0.7 10 ^ -29 g  cm^-3 = 2.8 10 ^ -47   gev^4/^3 c^5 .",
    "this value is smaller than the naive expectation by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "this embarrassing discrepancy suggests a conceptual rather than computational error .",
    "the main point of this paper is to question whether the ccp as it is currently stated is actually properly formulated .",
    "as we will see , our line of reasoning leads to an estimate of the cosmological constant which is much more reasonable , and of the correct order of magnitude .",
    "let us begin by ignoring gravity and considering only quantum mechanics in minkowski space .",
    "wheeler and feynman once estimated that there is enough zero point energy in a teacup to boil all the earth s oceans .",
    "this has led to the fantasy of tapping this energy for useful purposes , however most physicists do not take such proposals very seriously , and in light of the purported seriousness of the ccp , one should wonder why .",
    "in fact , there is no principle in quantum mechanics that allows a proper definition of the zero of energy : as in classical mechanics , one can only measure changes in energy , i.e. all energies can be shifted by a constant with no measurable consequences .",
    "similarly , the rules of statistical mechanics tell us that probabilities of configurations are ratios of ( conditioned ) partition functions , and these are invariant if the partition functions are multiplied by a common factor as induced by a global shift of the energies . based on his understanding of quantum electrodynamics and his own treatment of the casimir effect ,",
    "schwinger once said @xcite , `` ... the vacuum is not only the state of minimum energy , it is the state of _ zero _ energy , zero momentum , zero angular momentum , zero charge , zero whatever . ''",
    "one should not confuse zero point energy with `` vacuum fluctuations '' which refer to loop corrections to physical processes : photons do not scatter off the vacuum energy , otherwise they would be unable to traverse the universe . all of this strongly suggests that it is impossible to harness vacuum energy in order to do work , which in turn calls into question whether it could be a source of gravitation .",
    "the casimir effect is often correctly cited as proof of the reality of vacuum energy .",
    "however it needs to be emphasized that what is actually measured is the _ change _ of the vacuum energy as one varies a geometric modulus , i.e. how it depends on this modulus , and this is unaffected by an arbitrary shift of the zero of energy .",
    "the classic experiment is to measure the force between two plates as one changes their separation ; the modulus in question here is the distance @xmath7 between the plates and the force depends on how the vacuum energy varies with this separation .",
    "the casimir force @xmath8 is minus the derivative of the electrodynamic vacuum energy @xmath9 between the two plates , @xmath10 .",
    "an arbitrary shift of the vacuum energy by a constant that is independent of @xmath7 does not affect the measurement .",
    "for the electromagnetic field , with two polarizations , the well - known result is that the energy density between the plates is @xmath11 .",
    "note that this is an attractive force ; as we will see , in the cosmic context a repulsive force requires an over - abundance of fermions .",
    "it is also clear that the casimir effect is an infra - red phenomenon that has nothing to do with planck scale physics .",
    "our cosmological proposal will actually involve a mixing of the infra - red ( ir ) and ultra - violet ( uv ) .    for reasons that will be clear , let us illustrate the above remark on the casimir effect with another version of it : the vacuum energy in the finite size geometry of a higher dimensional cylinder .",
    "namely , consider a massless quantum bosonic field on a euclidean space - time geometry of @xmath12 where the circumference of the circle @xmath13 is @xmath14 .",
    "viewing the compact direction as spatial , the momenta in that direction are quantized and the vacuum energy density is [ cylinder ] = _ n = - ^-4 ^3/2 ( -3/2 ) ( -3 ) + const . due to the different boundary conditions in the periodic verses finite size directions , @xmath15 , where the overall factor of @xmath16 is because of the two photon polarizations .",
    "the above integral is divergent , however if one is only interested in its @xmath14-dependence , it can be regularized using the riemann zeta function giving the above expression .",
    "note that the ( infinite ) constant that has been discarded in the regularization is actually at the origin of the ccp .",
    "what is measurable is the @xmath14 dependence .",
    "one way to convince oneself that this regularization is meaningful is to view the compactified direction as euclidean time , where now @xmath17 is an inverse temperature .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 is now the free energy density of a single scalar field , and standard quantum statistical mechanics gives the convergent expression which is just the standard black - body formula : [ cylinder2 ] = @xmath19 = - ^-4 = - t^4 .",
    "the two above expressions ( [ cylinder ] , [ cylinder2 ] ) are equal due to a non - trivial functional identity satisfied by the @xmath20 function : @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "( see for instance the appendix in @xcite in this context . )",
    "the comparison of eqns .",
    "( [ cylinder],[cylinder2 ] ) strongly manifests the arbitrariness of the zero - point energy : whereas there is a divergent constant in ( [ cylinder ] ) , from the point of view of quantum statistical mechanics , the expression ( [ cylinder2 ] ) is actually convergent .",
    "either way of viewing the problem allows a shift of @xmath18 by an arbitrary constant with no measurable consequences .",
    "for instance , such a shift would not affect thermodynamic quantities like the entropy or density since they are derivatives of the free energy ; the only thing that is measurable is the @xmath14 dependence .",
    "we now include gravity in the above discussion . before stating the basic hypotheses of our study , we begin with general motivating remarks . all forms of energy",
    "should be considered as possible sources of gravitation , including the vacuum energy . however ,",
    "if one accepts the above arguments that the zero of energy is not absolutely definable in quantum mechanics , and that only the dependence of the vacuum energy on geometric moduli including the space - time metric is physically measurable , it then remains unspecified how to incorporate vacuum energy as a source of gravity .",
    "one needs an additional principle to fix the ambiguity .",
    "the above observations on the casimir energy were instrumental toward formulating such a principle , as we now describe . the cosmological friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric has no modulus corresponding to a finite size analogous to @xmath14 ,",
    "however it does have a time dependent scale factor @xmath0 : [ frw ] ds^2 = g _ dx^dx^= - dt^2 + a(t)^2 dd .",
    "( we assume the spatial curvature @xmath23 , as shown by recent astrophysical measurements . )",
    "when @xmath0 is constant in time , the flrw metric is just the minkowski spacetime metric .",
    "this leads us to propose that the dependence of the vacuum energy on the time variation of @xmath0 is all that is physically meaningful , in analogy with the @xmath14 dependence of @xmath18 .",
    "this idea is stated as a principle below , in terms of the stability of empty minkowski space , and is at the foundation of our conclusions .",
    "let us quickly review the standard cosmology .",
    "the einstein equations are [ einstein ] g _ r _ - g _",
    "= 8 g t _ where @xmath24 is newton s constant . the stress energy tensor @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the energy density and @xmath27 the pressure .",
    "the non - zero elements of the ricci tensor are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the ricci scalar is @xmath30 , where over - dots refer to time - derivatives .",
    "the temporal and spatial einstein equations ( [ einstein ] ) for the flrw metric are then the friedmann equations : [ friedmann1 ] @xmath31 ^ 2 & = & , + [ friedmann2 ] @xmath32 ^ 2 + 2 & = & - 8 g p . taking a time derivative of the first equation and using the second , one obtains [ energyconservation ] = - 3 @xmath31 ( + p ) , which expresses the usual energy conservation .",
    "the above three equations are thus not functionally independent , the reason being that bianchi identities relate the two friedmann equations to the energy conservation equation ( [ energyconservation ] ) .",
    "the total energy density is usually assumed to consist of a mixture of three non - interacting fluids , radiation , matter , and dark energy , @xmath33 , each of which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ energyconservation ] ) separately , with @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "then , eq.([energyconservation ] ) consistently implies @xmath37 .",
    "the energy density is related to the classical cosmological constant as @xmath38 .",
    "in this paper we will assume that dark energy comes entirely from vacuum energy , @xmath39 .",
    "the vacuum energy @xmath1 is a quantum expectation value , [ rhovacdef ] = = | , where @xmath40 a quantum operator corresponding to the energy density , which is usually associated with @xmath41 .",
    "apart from the ambiguity of the zero point energy , several other points should be emphasized .",
    "we will be studying the semi - classical einstein equations , where on the right hand side we include the contribution of vacuum energy @xmath42 for some choice of vacuum state @xmath43 .",
    "given the very low energy scale of expansion in the current universe , and the weakness of cosmological gravitational fields , it is very reasonable to assume that there is no need to quantize the gravitational field itself in the present epoch .",
    "one hypothesis of the standard formulation of the ccp is that the vacuum stress tensor is proportional to the metric@xcite . in an expanding universe ,",
    "the hamiltonian is effectively time dependent , and there is not necessarily a unique choice of @xmath43 , and , in contrast to flat minkowski space , no lorentz symmetry argument @xcite enforces that @xmath44 .",
    "one needs extra information that characterizes @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that @xmath45 is not universal since it depends on @xmath43 , and thus , for example , can not always be expressed in terms of purely geometric properties with no reference to the data of @xmath43 .",
    "one mathematical consistency condition is @xmath46 if the various components of the total energy are separately conserved , where @xmath47 is the covariant derivative , which is the statement of energy conservation .",
    "however this may not follow from @xmath48 since @xmath43 may be time dependent .",
    "also , @xmath49 is not necessarily expressed in terms of manifestly convariantly conserved tensors such as @xmath50 , again because it depends on @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , the only convariantly conserved geometric tensor that is second order in time derivatives is @xmath51 , and if @xmath52 , this would just amount to a renormalization of newton s constant @xmath24 .",
    "the second point is that if one includes @xmath53 as a source in einstein s equations , then since it depends on @xmath0 and its time derivatives , doing so can be thought of as studying the back - reaction of this vacuum energy on the geometry .",
    "the resulting equations must be solved self - consistently and there is no guarantee that there is a solution consistent with energy - conservation .    having made these preliminary observations , let us state all of the hypotheses that this work is based upon , which specify either the vacuum states or the nature of their stress - tensor .",
    "they are the following :    [ i ] as a criterion to identify possible vacuum states @xmath43 , we look for preferred quantization schemes such that @xmath43 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian at all times , which implies there is no particle production .",
    "[ ii ] we calculate a bare @xmath54 from the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath55 where @xmath40 is the quantum hamiltonian energy density operator .",
    "the calculation is regularized with a sharp cut - off @xmath3 in momentum space in order to make contact with the usual statement of the ccp .",
    "[ iii ] we propose the following principle which prescribes how to define a physical @xmath1 from @xmath56 : _ minkowski space that is empty of matter and radiation should be stable , that is , static .",
    "_ this requires that the physical @xmath1 equal zero when @xmath0 is constant in time .",
    "this leads to a @xmath1 that depends on @xmath0 and its derivatives , and also the cut - off .",
    "[ iv ] given this @xmath1 , we assume the components of the vacuum stress energy tensor have the form of a cosmological constant : [ tuu ] t _ = - g _ .",
    "we provide some support for this hypothesis in section iii , where we compare our calculation with manifestly covariant calculations performed in the past@xcite . we are going to check the consistency of this assumption in the next point [ v ] .",
    "[ v ] we include @xmath45 in einstein s equations and solve them self - consistently , assuming that vacuum energy and other forms of energy are separately conserved .",
    "in other words we study the consistency of the back - reaction of the vacuum energy on the geometry .",
    "the consistency condition is @xmath57 , which is equivalent to @xmath58 .",
    "there is no guarantee there is such a solution since @xmath1 depends on @xmath0 and its derivatives .",
    "certainly one may question the validity of these assumptions .",
    "however in our opinion , they are rather conservative in that they do not invoke symmetries , particles , nor other , perhaps higher dimensional structures , that are not yet known to exist .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to work out the logical consequences of these modest hypotheses .",
    "our main findings are the following :    @xmath59   if there is a cut - off in momentum space @xmath3 , then by dimensional analysis the vacuum energy density has symbolically the `` adiabatic '' expansion ( up to constants ) : [ expansion ] _",
    "vac,0 = k_c^4 + k_c^2 + ^2 + where @xmath60 is related to the curvature and is a linear combination of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , depending on the choice of @xmath43 .",
    "the principle of the stability of empty minkowski space [ iii ] leads us to discard the @xmath63 term , but not the other terms since they depend on time derivatives of @xmath0 .",
    "the vacuum energy is now viewed as a _ low energy _",
    "phenomenon , like the casimir effect .",
    "other regularization schemes , based for example on point - splitting@xcite , insist on a finite @xmath1 and thus discard the first two terms . according to our principles ,",
    "the second term must be kept since it depends dynamically on the geometry . in the current universe",
    "@xmath64 it is approximately on the order of @xmath65 , where @xmath4 is the hubble constant , and if the cut - off @xmath66 is on the order of the planck energy , then the resulting value of @xmath1 is the right order of magnitude in comparison with the measured value ( [ rhovacmeasured ] ) , namely @xmath67 using for @xmath4 the present value of the hubble constant . the @xmath68 is much too small to explain the measured value .",
    "we emphasize that our @xmath1 is not simply proportional to @xmath69 , see eqns .",
    "( [ rhovacphys],[rhovachat ] ) below , and is in fact constant in time for the self - consistent solutions that we find .",
    "there is nothing special about @xmath4 here , since @xmath1 is constant in time ; we are simply evaluating it at the present time which involves @xmath4 .",
    "a practical point of view is that astrophysical observations are telling us that the @xmath63 term should be shifted away .",
    "more importantly , it remains to determine whether the term that we do keep , @xmath70 , has physical consequences in agreement with observations , which is the main purpose of our study .",
    "is shifting away the @xmath63 term a fine - tuning ?",
    "let us address this in the context of the adm / ad framework@xcite .",
    "in the latter work it was shown that in classical general relativity , once the value of the cosmological constant @xmath71 is fixed , there is a unique choice of energy that is conserved , i.e. there is no more freedom to shift it . for asymptotically flat spacetimes ,",
    "this energy was proven to be positive and only zero for minkowski space@xcite .",
    "its `` main importance is that it is related to the stability of minkowski space as the ground state of general relativity '' , to quote ref.@xcite . for de sitter space",
    ", there are similar statements , though with some restrictions@xcite .",
    "let us suppose that for some as yet unknown physical reason , perhaps due to quantum gravity , there is a meaningful bare cosmological constant @xmath72 .",
    "then the @xmath73 that we calculate leads to an effective cosmological constant @xmath74 in semi - classical gravity , and this is what is actually measured .",
    "our prescription [ iii ] amounts to setting @xmath75 to zero in minkowski space where @xmath76 vanishes , by adjusting @xmath72 or the manifestly constant part of @xmath73 .",
    "this is a fine - tuning if @xmath72 is unambiguously defined .",
    "our work has nothing more to say about this issue , rather , the main point of this work is to study the effects and consistency of what remains , i.e. the @xmath77 term which does not vanish in an expanding geometry .",
    "one may argue that , as in any field theory , the parameters in the effective lagrangian must ultimately be chosen to match experiments .",
    "as we will see , under certain conditions , this term can mimic a cosmological constant in a way that is consistent with the current era of cosmology .",
    "the analogy with the casimir effect is clear both mathematically ( compare eqn .",
    "( [ cylinder ] ) and eqn .",
    "( [ rhovacbare ] ) below ) , and physically . in the casimir effect ,",
    "as one pulls apart the plates in a controlled manner in an experiment , this induces a measurable force . in cosmology the analog of the growing separation of the plates",
    "is the expansion itself , which induces an acceleration ; the complication is that the effect of this back - reaction must be solved self - consistently , as we will do .",
    "note that whereas the casimir force is attractive , to describe the positive accelerated expansion of the universe , one needs a positive @xmath1 , which as we will explain , requires an overabundance of fermions .",
    "@xmath59   for a universe consisting of only matter and vacuum energy , such as the present universe , there is a choice of @xmath43 with the above @xmath1 that leads to a consistent solution if a specific relation between @xmath3 and the newton constant @xmath24 is satisfied . by `` consistent '' , we mean @xmath57 .",
    "our solution for @xmath0 is consistent with present day astrophysical observations if one ignores the very small radiation component .",
    "in fact , as we will show , our solution @xmath0 , eq . ( [ asolmatter ] ) below , once one matches the integration constants to their present measured values , is identical to the standard @xmath78 model of the present universe , i.e. a universe consisting only of a cosmological constant plus cold dark matter , and is thus not ruled out by observations up to fairly large redshift @xmath79 ; it certainly agrees with supernova observations , which are at low @xmath80 . to our knowledge",
    "this choice for @xmath43 has not been considered before .",
    "below , we also remark on the cosmic coincidence problem in light of our result .",
    "we speculate that the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath3 suggests that gravity itself arises from quantum fluctuations , and we provide an argument that `` derives '' gravity from quantum mechanics .",
    "@xmath81 for a universe consisting of only radiation and vacuum energy , there is another _ different _ choice of vacuum , @xmath82 , that also has a consistent solution , again only for a certain relation between @xmath3 and @xmath24 .",
    "this vacuum has been studied before and is referred to as the conformal vacuum in the literature .",
    "we suggest that this solution possibly describes inflation , without invoking an inflaton field , and speculate on a scenario to resolve the `` graceful exit '' problem .",
    "we also argue that when @xmath83 is large , the first friedmann equation sets the scale @xmath84 , which is the right order of magnitude if @xmath3 is the planck scale .",
    "it is worthwhile comparing our model with other , similar proposals .",
    "based on `` wave - function of the universe '' arguments@xcite , or simply dimensional analysis@xcite , it was proposed that @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a dimensionful scale factor related to the cosmological horizon ; roughly @xmath87 . in the present universe",
    "@xmath88 , so this @xmath1 is also of the right magnitude .",
    "the problem with it is that it is time - dependent , and ruled out by observations .",
    "different arguments based on unimodular gravity@xcite also led to the proposal that @xmath89 .",
    "the work that is closest to ours is by maggiore and collaborators@xcite .",
    "our approach differs from all the above in that our @xmath1 is constant in time , in agreement with observations .",
    "the next two sections simply describe these two choices of vacua and analyze the self - consistency of the back - reaction .",
    "our analysis is done using an adiabatic expansion . in the conclusion",
    ", we further discuss our results .",
    "we first review the standard version of the cosmological constant problem . since a free quantum field is an infinite collection of harmonic oscillators for each wave - vector @xmath90 , we first review simple quantum mechanical versions in order to point out the difference between bosons and fermions .",
    "canonical quantization of a bosonic mode @xcite of frequency @xmath91 yields to a pair of creation and annihilation operators , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 = 1 $ ] , and a hamiltonian @xmath94 .",
    "the boson zero - point energy is thus identified as @xmath95 . for fermions ,",
    "the zero point energy has the opposite sign .",
    "fermionic canonical quantization @xcite yields to grassmanian operators @xmath96 , with @xmath97 , and a hamiltonian @xmath98 .",

    "the above applies with @xmath102 , where @xmath90 is a @xmath101-dimensional wave - vector .",
    "thus the zero - point vacuum energy density is [ rhovac ] =   , where @xmath103 is the number of bosonic , fermionic particle species . regularizing the integral with an ultra - violet cut - off @xmath104 much larger than @xmath100",

    "one should also note that in the above calculation , a positive value for @xmath1 requires more bosons than fermions , contrary to the currently known particle content of the standard model .    as explained in the introduction , we are interested in the vacuum energy of a free quantum field in the non - static flrw background spacetime geometry . for simplicity",

    "furthermore , at these very early times the radiation plays a role and our model breaks down , perhaps with @xmath43 being replaced by @xmath82 of the next section .",
    "an alternative way of summarizing what we have added to the discussion of the cosmic coincidence problem is the following : if one takes the point of view that the scale of vacuum energy @xmath1 is not determined by planck scale physics , but rather by current day physics , as in our model , then there is much less of a need to explain any fine - tuning in the very far past .",
